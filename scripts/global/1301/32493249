<p>My projects only serves roughly 30-40 users at same time. Everything run smoothly in English culture but when user switches to chinese language, all functions are very slow and some urls are hanged.I don't know why everything run smoothly in English but very slow in Chinese . Here is my code for processing chinese culture:</p>  <pre><code> protected override void Initialize(System.Web.Routing.RequestContext requestContext)     {         base.Initialize(requestContext);         var currentLanguage = LangService.GetCurrentLanguage();         LangService.SetPageCulture(currentLanguage);     }   public void SetPageCulture(string languageCode)     {         CultureInfo def = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(_defaultLanguage);          Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo(languageCode);         Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(languageCode);          Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.DateTimeFormat = def.DateTimeFormat;         Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat = def.NumberFormat;     } </code></pre>  <ul> <li>But if I modify web config then all functions will run smoothly again in a while (30-60 minutes). After that they are hanged again.</li> <li>I have also used debug-tool to capture dump-file and make an analysis but every things are normal. So anybody can give me a clue for this weird case.Many thank for your helps.</li> </ul>
