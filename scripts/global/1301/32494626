<p>I'm running IIS 7.0 on a Windows 2008 R1 Server and want to setup IIS Manager Users. Due to some fact, every last try to access the site is rejected (HTTP Unauthorized).</p>  <p>The following additional IIS components are installed:</p>  <ul> <li>Security\Basic Authentification</li> <li>Security\URL Authorisation</li> <li>Management Tools\IIS Management Console</li> <li>Management Tools\Management Service</li> </ul>  <p>Then I configured the Management Service to use Windows or IIS-Manager-User Credentials. I also added some IIS-Manager-Users and activated them on my Website.</p>  <p>On the Authentification Settings Pane, I disabled anonymous access and enabled basic authentification.</p>  <p>As a result, when browsing the website, a password is now required. The thing is, I can access the page with Windows Credentials, <strong>but not with the IIS Manager User Credentials</strong>. In this case the result is always HTTP 401 - Unauthorized.</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
