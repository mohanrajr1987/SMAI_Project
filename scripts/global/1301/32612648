<p>I have a WebApi app that has a controller that does nothing (for testing).  All it does is returns a HttepResponseMessage with "NoContent"</p>  <pre><code>public HttpResponseMessage DoSomething()  {     Debug.WriteLine("DidIt: {0:mm:ss.ffff}", DateTime.Now);     return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.NoContent); } </code></pre>  <p>In my Application_EndRequest I have similar code:</p>  <pre><code>protected void Application_EndRequest(object sender, EventArgs e) {     Debug.WriteLine("EndRequest: {0:mm:ss.ffff}", DateTime.Now); } </code></pre>  <p>When I run this, the two Debug statements output time that is about 3 seconds apart and Fiddler shows a response time of 3 seconds.  So something is happening between the controller returning the result and ASP.Net ending the request.  </p>  <p>I do not have any modules defined in the web.config and only have two handlers:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;         &lt;handlers&gt;           &lt;remove name="ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0" /&gt;           &lt;remove name="OPTIONSVerbHandler" /&gt;           &lt;remove name="TRACEVerbHandler" /&gt;           &lt;add name="ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0" path="*." verb="*" type="System.Web.Handlers.TransferRequestHandler" preCondition="integratedMode,runtimeVersionv4.0" /&gt;           &lt;add name="dotless" path="*.less" verb="GET" type="dotless.Core.LessCssHttpHandler,dotless.Core" resourceType="File" preCondition="" /&gt;         &lt;/handlers&gt;       &lt;/system.webServer&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Removing these handlers do not have any affect.</p>  <p>The Debug Output window shows 3 threads ending between the controller and the endRequest.  It appears that the request completes when the first thread ends, but I cannot figure out what that thread is.</p>  <pre><code>DidIt: 10:57.6023 The thread 0x8f8 has exited with code 0 (0x0). The thread 0x1e00 has exited with code 0 (0x0). The thread 0x4878 has exited with code 0 (0x0). EndRequest: 10:59.8751 </code></pre>  <p>I am testing this with IISExpress, but am getting the same results in IIS 7.5</p>  <p>Thanks for any insight you can provide.</p>
