<p>I have a website that has a URL redirect going on and I'm trying to figure out where it is being done. I thought it was through the domain company (GoDaddy) but I removed any forwarding there and it still happens. Their support told be because the IP address redirects itself redirects (not just the domain name), it's not on there end. It uses IIS7 but there is nothing in the HTTP Redirect. It's an ASP.NET site with forms authentication. </p>  <p>Basically whenever I try to hit any page on the domain it redirects to a login URL the first time. Once the page is up it navigates fine but I need to be able to hit a sales page from a third party site without the login.</p>  <p>Anybody have thoughts on where else the redirect could be happening? Thanks</p>
