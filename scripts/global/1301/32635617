<p>using reverse proxy for url rewrite and single sign on for multiple web apps. I am using IIS 7.0's  ARR and URL rewrite to achieve that.I want to send the authenticated user info to web application once the user is authenticated. I have wrote a custom http module to set a servervariable to user name on Authorize request event.But at the web application level  servervariable is still empty. Can anyone please help with this?</p>
