<p>I need your help in order to solve a question. I need to set the font size according to a value I stored into a session.  I need to write something similar to</p>  <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;a href="/chips" style="font-size: (#session.soglia)pt"&gt;&lt;s:property value="nome"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but this does not work! How can I do? The font size is stored into a session because it can dinamically change (an action class calculates it before calling the jsp page). Thank you!!!</p>
