<p>I have few questions here consider the following loops (let N = 8)</p>  <pre><code>for(int i=1;i&lt;N/2;i++){    // this is O(logN)  } </code></pre>  <p><strong>N/2 = 4</strong> but <strong>log(8) = 3</strong> (considering base as 2) then why above loop considered as O(logN)</p>  <p>and How does O(loglogN) loop look like?</p>  <p><strong>PS: Sorry for my poor mathematical concepts</strong></p>
