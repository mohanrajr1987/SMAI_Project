<p>I'm looking to solve the set packing problem (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing</a>) in java with sets containing around ~50 subsets of length 3. My current approach, which is to iterate through 2^50 in binary and use the 1's as subsets, is prohibitively slow. Are there any other methodologies i could use to solve this problem faster? I'm looking for a run time of under 5 seconds, is this even feasible via any method?</p>
