<p>I would like to develop a visualization tool that able to recognize c code and with some function call and timer triggering mechanism, I will be able to simulate some complex algorithm routine developed in c code.</p>  <p>I am thinking maybe can utilizing the python Bokeh for the visualization, but I am not very sure about how can I recognize the c code in python and represent a particular c 'object' into a graphic representation.</p>  <p>Can anyone suggest a better way to connect the c code and being recognized  in python?</p>
