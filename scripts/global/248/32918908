<p>I want to find number pairs in an input, then sum up those pairs but leave out unpaired numbers. By that I mean</p>  <pre><code>8 8 8 = 16 8 8 8 8 8 = 32 </code></pre>  <p>so numbers with a pair of two will get counted but a number that doesn't have a pair won't get counted. Sorry if I worded this weird I dont know how to explain it but the example will help</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>8 3 4 4 5 9 9 5 2 </code></pre>  <p>Would output:</p>  <pre><code>36 </code></pre>  <p>4+4+5+5+9+9 = 36</p>  <p>In python </p>
