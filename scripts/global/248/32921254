<p>There is an array of <strong>N</strong> elements. I have to choose <strong>K</strong> elements and multiply them, say the value of multiplication is <strong>M(k)</strong>. Now add all possible <strong>M(k)</strong>. Say the sum is <strong>S(k)</strong>. Is it possible to determine all the values of <strong>S(k)</strong> (where 1 &lt;= k &lt;= N) in time-complexity of <strong>O(N^2)</strong>?</p>  <p>There is a solution in this forum in Python language but I don't know Python and beside this I want this problem to be solved generally.</p>
