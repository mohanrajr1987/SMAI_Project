<p>This is a general decision tree algorithm question of using attributes to split nodes based on entropy. I am using a Decision Tree algorithm in SQL Server Data Mining to predict the type of an animal. What I noticed was that the same input column / attribute is used twice to split the node. My understanding was that an input column / attribute could only be used once for splitting a node. For example, below reptiles is used to split each value of animals ( 1 and 0 ). Based on what I have read so far, for a decision tree, once an input column / attribute is used to split a node value, you should not be using it again. You pick an attribute from remaining set of "UNused" attributes. Please let me know / correct me if I am wrong. Each attribute can take value of 1 or 0. I can understand reptiles =1 and reptiles=0 when animals=1. But once reptiles has been used as an attribute for a split, I don't understand why it is being used again for the animals=0 split.</p>  <pre><code>                    reptiles=1 --&gt;     animals=1 --&gt;                                reptiles=0 --&gt; </code></pre>  <p>All -->  </p>  <pre><code>                    reptiles=0 --&gt;     animals=0 --&gt;                      reptiles=1 --&gt;  </code></pre>
