<p>A growing trend, especially among the tumblr audience, is 'keysmashing.' Where, instead of using actual words to express ones excitement or disbelief, they literally resort to typing random characters such as 'fsdakhf;adskh' or in all caps like 'FMDSOIAHO;EAHF.'</p>  <p>It also seems to be one of those influential things, where as soon as one user does it, others begin to do it too. Before long, you see something like</p>  <blockquote>   <p>User1: &lt;insert funny comment/link&gt;<br>   User2: i jus saklfjdldsahf8fh<br>   User2: cant evneaoiufhapisf<br>   User3: bahasaiofhj9pdfsbdsf<br>   User4: lol omg<br>   User2: faisohkj  </p> </blockquote>  <p>This, as you can imagine, becomes very spammy in a chat. So, without resorting to having to use some kind of autocorrect/dictionary, are there any decent methods of detecting these speech patterns?</p>
