<p>I am trying to create a news feed similar to that of Etsy using Redis instead of memcache. But I failed to understand why they use bit field instead of say for example ints to specify which kind of activity it is?</p>  <p>You can see this on page 25 on this slide: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/danmckinley/etsy-activity-feeds-architecture" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net/danmckinley/etsy-activity-feeds-architecture</a></p>  <p>I fail to understand why they do this. Why do they do this? </p>
