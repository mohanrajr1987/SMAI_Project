<p>I'm a beginner with Java and I'm trying to make two different programs but I'm having issues with transferring the data from one to the other.</p>  <p>The first program is like a random number generator. It looks like this (simplified, but same idea):</p>  <pre><code>public class Tester{   public static double num;   public static void main(String[] args){     double n;     n = Math.random() * 100;     System.out.println(n);     num = n;   }   public static double gen(){     return num;   } } </code></pre>  <p>Then, I'm trying to call that function and print n random numbers and put them all into a list. That program looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>public class lister{   public static void main(String[] args){     //declare     int n,counter;     double[] list;     double num;     //initialize     n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);     list = new double[n];     counter = 0;     double num = Tester.gen();     //add all generated numbers to a list, print them     while (counter &lt; n){       num = Tester.gen();       list[counter] = num;       System.out.println(num);       ++counter;     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>But num just ends up being 0.0 every time. I've tried to not make it static, but that comes with it's own host of issues and, as I understand it, static doesn't mean not changeable.</p>  <p>How do I fix this to make num a new number each time the while loop is run? Is that even possible?</p>
