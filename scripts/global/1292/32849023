<p>I hava an application which can upload files and stores them in the tomcat base folder(obtained by <code>System.getProperty("catalina.base")</code>...) How can I get this resource, picture for example by link?  How to obtain absolute(or relative) path for those resources?</p>  <p>For example: <a href="http://localhost:8097/test.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8097/test.jpg</a></p>
