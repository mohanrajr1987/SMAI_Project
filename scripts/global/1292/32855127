<p>I came across a warning in Linux system about an array which was declared in usual manner. The warning said that <strong><code>static const char * const</code></strong> should be used instead of just <strong><code>char *</code></strong> . Why is that? </p>  <p>How do I know when should an array be declared static constant? </p>  <p>What does <code>const</code> after <code>char *</code> mean?</p>
