<p>I am trying to get text from textview which is located in class 2 to use it in class 1 by pressing a button. I do this by sending an Intent, but i got the error of my content. That is what i am trying to send (from class 2 to class 1):</p>  <pre><code>public static void intent_send(){ Intent i = new Intent(); i.putExtra("number",Integer.parseInt(text_view_current_page.getText().toString())); class2.startActivity(i); } </code></pre>  <p>text_view_current_page is a static TextView, otherwise it has an error in this void. I call this void by pressing a button in class 1:</p>  <pre><code>Class2.intent_send(); Intent i = getIntent(); Bundle b = i.getExtras(); PagerNumber = b.getInt("number"); </code></pre>  <p>I have an error in the line of the content definition:</p>  <pre><code>i.putExtra("number",Integer.parseInt(text_view_current_page.getText().toString())); </code></pre>  <p>What should i do with this textView to be able get it's text from another class by pressing a button? Should it be static or should i declare it in that class which receives an intent?</p>
