<p>I am trying to run the <a href="https://spinroot.com/uno/" rel="nofollow">uno static analyzer</a> but I can't seem to get it working. For instance, after typing <code>make</code> within the uno/src folder to compile uno, I attempt to run it by typing <code>uno -a sample.c</code></p>  <p>When I do this, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>sh: /usr/bin/uno_local: No such file or directory sh: /usr/bin/uno_global: No such file or directory uno:    check completed, try 'uno -h' for different checks </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone explain what I'm doing wrong?</p>
