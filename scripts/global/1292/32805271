<p>After reading a ton of documentation, I still don't have a good grasp on what exactly counts as a static vs. a  user uploaded file... or what exactly a static file is even. </p>  <p><strong>1. Static files</strong></p>  <p>Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/" rel="nofollow">describes</a> static files as things like "images, javascript, css". OK, makes sense. But all those .py files and .html template files etc... they aren't static?? They don't "change" while the site is running. What exactly is a static file? What does "serving static files" mean? How is that different than "serving" a "views.py" file or a "home.html" file? </p>  <p>On top of that, why do I even need "collectstatic" anyway? Why do all my static files need to be in one place? I suppose if you're using a separate web server to "serve" them that makes sense... still, not sure what exactly that even means. </p>  <p>Also, where does "collectstatic" go to find all the supposed static files anyway? Does it go through all my code and see where I'm accessing image / javascript files?</p>  <p><strong>2. User uploaded files</strong></p>  <p>Say I just take this static thing at face value, what happens if a user uploads an image? Do I need a program running in the background that constantly runs "collectstatic"? </p>  <p>Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/files/" rel="nofollow">describes</a> media files as a way to manage user-uploaded content. Honestly I haven't tried this (will do so right now), but still this represents a question: if it's so important to put all the "static" files in one place, why is it suddenly OK not to do that for user-uploaded files? </p>  <p>Are the files inside this "MEDIA_ROOT" directory not collected by "collectstatic"? What if I just put all my images / javascript / css into this media folder? Then nothing is collected? Anything wrong with that? </p>  <p>Thanks for any insights anyone can shed on this. </p>
