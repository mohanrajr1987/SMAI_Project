<p>I have a spring application where in some cases I need to create an object at runtime, as opposed to a spring injected bean. This object should be created with properties that come from the application context however. If this object is not spring-injected, how can I still take advantage of IoC? Should I make these object properties static and inject them into a bean via non-static setters?</p>
