<p>I got trouble when design class for my project. Currently, we developed 2 projects with the same structure but have some differences inside.</p>  <p>At project A, I have class <code>ACore</code> that includes <code>class AConfiguration, AEquipmentManager</code>. And I made an instance for object <code>ACore</code> that at everywhere in project, i can use: <code>Acore.AConfiguration.XYZ</code> (XYZ is method or property of <code>AConfiguration</code> class) or <code>ACore.AEquipmentmanager.ABC</code>(ABC is method or property of <code>AEquipmentManager</code> class)</p>  <p>At project B, I still have same structure with project A (<code>BCore, BConfiguration, BEquipmentManager</code>). But <code>BConfiguration</code> has different with <code>AConfiguration</code> (because each project has different configuration) and <code>BEquipmentManager</code> also has different with <code>AEquipmentManager</code>. </p>  <p>I want to reuse code for class <code>ACore</code> and <code>BCore</code> because they have the same code (Initialize EquipmentManager, Initialize Configuration, Dispose EquipmentManager, Dispose Configuration,...). Now, I want to write a library <code>BaseCore</code> that have the same structure with <code>ACore</code> and <code>BCore</code> (there are 2 class <code>Configuration</code>, <code>EquipmentManager</code>, same Intialize function, Dispose function), and with specific project (like A project, B project, or even C, D project later) i can use <code>BaseCore</code> library class (for reuse code) and just implement <code>XEquipmentManager</code>, <code>XCofiguration</code> depend on each project.</p>  <p>What is the best way I should design in this case? Thank for sharing your idea.</p>  <p>Regards, Hoa Nguyen</p>
