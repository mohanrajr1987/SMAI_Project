<p>I'm currently exploring the potentials of static sites. I don't have enough server-side experience to know if what I'm wanting to do is possible - hence this question.</p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>  <p>Essentially, is it possible for a static site being served by NGINX to "call out" to a script (in any server-side language) located on the same server but listening on a different port? If so, how?</p>  <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>auth</li> <li>payment processing (via Stripe, Braintree, et al.)</li> <li>any other service requiring server-side interaction</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>  <p>Static sites are great but there's often need for server-side-only services. One common approach here is to simply use a third part service (eg: Gumroad for payments). But often it's desirable <em>not</em> to use a third part service. <em>This</em> is what I'm trying to learn more about - and I'm finding surprisingly little.
