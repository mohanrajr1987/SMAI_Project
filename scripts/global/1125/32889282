<p>I am trying to save the parameters of actions to my database (along with other data). My first issue was that I couldn't figure out how to get the action parameters into a readable string. </p>  <p>The approach I took to do this was by doing the following: </p>  <pre><code> public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)         {             string actionParams = Json.Encode(filterContext.ActionParameters);             // Other code here         } </code></pre>  <p>My questions are as follows:</p>  <ol> <li>Is this the <em>best</em> way of doing this?</li> <li>If this approach is acceptable, how would I go about formatting this into something more readable? </li> </ol>  <p>An example of the data returned is the following: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"{\"model\":{\"CurrentEmail\":\"test@test.edu\",\"NewEmail\":\"test2@test.com\",\"ConfirmEmail\":\"test2@test.com\",\"Password\":\"31231\"}}"</p> </blockquote>
