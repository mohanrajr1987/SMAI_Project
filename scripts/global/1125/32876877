<p>I'm looking for some advice. I need an extremely space efficient JSON serialization format; (I was thinking MessagePack); and to be able to perform disk IO operations at O(n), without having to load the file completely into memory. (RAM and Disk space are very limited)</p>  <p>So my idea is to have a key based data store; where you ask for a key, and it will read from the file until it can find that key; grab the value, deserialize it and return it.</p>  <p>My questions: is there an existing Python library that can do this for me within my contstraints? (Pickle cannot gaurentee O(n) IO and its serialize is on average slower than JSON). Or is there something that could assist the key storage aspects, or would this be something I would want to write myself?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
