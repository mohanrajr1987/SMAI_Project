<p>Can Java read a series of Objects that extend a abstract class without an issue with serialization?</p>  <p>for example Class B, C, and D are all objects b, c, and d respectively and all extend the Abstract class A.  </p>  <p>can the following code read all the objects and treat them as an instance of A? or does each Object have to be read as the same Object as it was written regardless of inheritance?</p>  <pre><code>ObjectInputStream input = new ObjectInputStream(getSocket().getInputStream()); try {     A generic = (A) input.readObject(); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {     e.printStackTrace(); } </code></pre>
