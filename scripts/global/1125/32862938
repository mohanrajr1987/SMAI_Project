<p>I've seen a lot of questions on how to Serialize POJO's in java using different frameworks, but I wanted to really understand the need of making our POJO's Serializable in the first place. You use JavaScript to handle the POJO objects or Spring or any other framework - why is it that we always have to make our POJO's <code>Serializable</code> ?</p>  <p>Is it something that has to be done on a GOOD PRACTICE or a BEST PRACTICE? If it is not the case, what is the advantage that we would be able to leverage by Serializing a POJO class?</p>  <p>There are a couple of threads that discuss about this, but I'm not really satisfied with the explanation / answers! Can anyone here, shed some light on this concept please?</p>
