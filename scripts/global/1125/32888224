<p>We have a common api that we use to serialize objects to string.</p>  <p>We are using <code>writeValueAsString()</code> method for this purpose.</p>  <p>One strange thing that I observed was that on passing a string input to <code>writeValueAsString()</code> method, quotes are getting appended.</p>  <p>E.g.: If I have an input string "ABC", after calling <code>writeValueAsString()</code> method on it, it becomes ""ABC""</p>
