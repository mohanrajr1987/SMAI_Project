<p>I have a container view controller with a fixed height view at the top and an embedded UINavigationController below it. The container view that embeds the UINavigationController has a Top Space constraint to the fixed height view, and a Bottom Space constraint to the top layout guide. This results in the navigation controller's height being 599 on an iPhone 6 (the fixed height view at the top occupies the remaining 68 points). I've verified the height of the navigtation controller's view at runtime in lldb.</p>  <p>However, when I push a UITableViewController into the embedded UINavigationController, the height of the UITableViewController's table view is 667 points, not 599 as I would have expected. I can work around this by setting a bottom content inset of 68 points, but I'd like to avoid this if possible.</p>  <p>What do I need to do to ensure that the height of the views of controller's pushed into this UINavigationController match the height of the navigation controller?</p>
