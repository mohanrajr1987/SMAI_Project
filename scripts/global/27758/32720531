<p>I want to change font and color of my UINavigationBar from the AppDelegate. For this I do:</p>  <pre><code>let appearance = UINavigationBar.appearance()     appearance.translucent = false     appearance.titleTextAttributes = [NSFontAttributeName: UIFont(name: "Chalkduster", size: 21)!]     appearance.barTintColor = UIColor(red: 80/255, green: 185/255, blue: 225/255, alpha: 1)     appearance.titleTextAttributes = [NSForegroundColorAttributeName: UIColor.whiteColor()] </code></pre>  <p>but in this case works just one of them, for example:</p>  <p>if I set at first - Font, at the second - color, it just change color, not font, too. If I set at first - Color, at the second - Font, it just change font, not color, too. </p>  <p>How can I change both of them?</p>
