<p>I want to change the navigation bar from translucent to transparent with animation during a push segue but it becomes transparent immediately.</p>  <p>I extended the navigation controller:</p>  <pre><code>    func setNavigationBarTransparent(transparent:Bool, animated:Bool) {      // If current state of navigation bar is desired state then abort     if barIsTransparent == transparent { return }      // Reset transparency status     barIsTransparent = transparent      // Define transparency     let image: UIImage? = transparent ? UIImage() : nil      // Define animation     let duration: NSTimeInterval = animated ? 0.3 : 0.0      // Style navigation bar     UIView.animateWithDuration(         duration,         animations: {             self.navigationBar.setBackgroundImage(image, forBarMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)             self.navigationBar.shadowImage = image     }) } </code></pre>  <p>I call <code>setNavigationBarTransparent(true, animated: true)</code> in the destination view controller's <code>viewWillAppear</code>. The transition of the bar transparency is smooth during the segue as long as the navigation bar has no background image, i.e. it has no other view behind it because it is translucent. When I scroll up the collection view so that there is an image behind the translucent navigation bar, the transparency happens suddenly with zero duration.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Just saw that during the reverse segue the bar does not actually change it's image from transparent to translucent but the frame slides in from above. So it would be sufficient for the bar's frame to slide out to above during the "translucent to transparent" segue.</p>
