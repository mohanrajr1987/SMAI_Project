<p>I am following a tutorial on Udemy about Navigation Controllers.</p>  <p>The instructions are to drag a Navigation Controller onto the storyboard, and then drag and drop a Bar Button Item on the right of its navigation bar to segue to another view controller. </p>  <p>However, when I drag the Bar Button Item to its would-be position on the navigation bar, no drop-zone gets highlighted, and the button gets added to a random tab at the bottom of the screen.</p>  <p>I have tried finding references to this problem but all solutions are programmatic and given the wysiwyg nature of iOS development I would like to solve it through XCode UI.</p>  <p>Is there some setup I must change or is this an XCode 7 discrepancy?</p>
