<p>I'm trying to solve a view placement bug that has arisen as of iOS 9. I am instantiating a view controller from a xib file (non-autolayout) and then pushing this onto my <code>UINavigationController</code>.</p>  <p>The problem is that when the view controller's <code>viewWillAppear</code> method is called, its frame has not yet been adjusted to the navigation controller's size and is still what was set in the xib file. It doesn't get set properly now until <code>viewDidAppear</code>.</p>  <p>This is completely screwing up my code. Does anyone know precisely what has changed that is causing this and what is the best way to handle it? I don't want to wait until <code>viewDidAppear</code> because this will look bad and make for a poor user experience.</p>
