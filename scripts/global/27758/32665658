<p>I am using a subclassed UINavigationController which manages all the viewControllers in my app. It pushes and pops viewControllers in the main flow and presents and dismisses modally those viewControllers which are required arbitrarily.</p>  <p>In one case, I need to present a viewController modally before popping another in the main flow, like so:</p>  <pre><code>//Called in custom UINavigationController subclass [self presentViewController:searchVC animated:YES completion:^{     [self popViewControllerAnimated:NO];  }]; </code></pre>  <p>The above code used to work without a hitch till iOS 8, and does not work in iOS 9. The same viewController as before remains when the presented vc is dismissed.</p>  <p>Also, this is being logged in the console:</p>  <pre><code>popViewControllerAnimated: called on &lt;CustomNavigationController 0x7d846600&gt; while an existing transition or presentation is occurring; the navigation stack will not be updated. </code></pre>  <p>This was never an issue till now, especially since the popViewController method is called in the completion block.</p>  <p>Could this be a bug? </p>  <p>Any solution/suggestion/workaround is welcome.</p>
