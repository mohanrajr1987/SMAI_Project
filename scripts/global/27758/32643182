<p>In xcode 6 I was able to have two views still 'show' segue each other successfully regardless if they were embedded in two different navigationControllers, like so:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fa7yf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fa7yf.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> However now, when I implement this setup, the second view it presented modally rather then shown from the previous view, and the shared navigationBar attributes set programmatically are not passed on to the latter view.. is this just an Xcode 7 issue? because I pulled this off successfully in Xcode 6 as I stated.. ANY suggestions ?</p>
