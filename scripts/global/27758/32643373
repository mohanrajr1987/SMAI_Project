<p>I current have 1stViewController and 2ndViewController.  </p>  <p>On a button push in 1stViewController I use the following code to push to 2ndViewController</p>  <pre><code>@IBAction func segueButton(sender: UIButton) {      self.presentViewController(2ndViewController(), animated: true, completion: nil)  } </code></pre>  <p>I embedded 2ndViewController in a navigation controller by going to storyboard and selecting Editor ->embed in -> navigation controller.</p>  <p>However the self.presentViewController code above still goes to second view controller.  </p>  <p>What would I write to programmatically hand control to the navigation control that 2ndViewController is embedded in?</p>
