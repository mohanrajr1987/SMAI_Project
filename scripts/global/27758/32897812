<p>I have two <code>UICollectionView</code> objects in two <code>UICollectionViewController</code> objects each referenced from a navigation controller.</p>  <p>The complicated part is that the <code>UINavigationController</code> is in one (of two) container views (themselves in a master view), the purpose being to put an ad banner in one container view and the nav controller and all the rest of the content in the second.</p>  <p>It works OK at first - the ad bar appears, and for the first collection view which is defined as the root controller of the navigator. The layout is sized correctly with a height of 702 (768 - 66).</p>  <p>However, when I present the second collection view controller it lays out its contents as if it has a height of 768 pixels.</p>  <p>In both cases when <code>viewDidLoad</code> is called in the controllers the <code>self.view.frame</code> height is 768. and when <code>viewWillLayoutSubviews</code> is called the height is 702.</p>  <p>But when <code>prepareLayout</code> is called in the layout manager the height of the content view is 702 in the first case and 768 in the second.</p>  <p>Any idea why this inconsistency and how I might fix it?</p>
