<p>Can I have <code>UINavigationController</code> and <code>storyboard</code>s operating independently?  Can I have multiple <code>UINavigationController</code>s inside of a <code>storyboard</code>? Is a <code>UIStoryboard</code> actually based on <code>UINavigationController</code>? Why are multiple <code>storyboard</code>s allowed, if <code>storyboard</code>s are a comprehensive solution to <code>VC</code> transitions for one app? What are the ground rules for using <code>storyboard</code>s?</p>  <p>examples of questions about ground rules:</p>  <ul> <li>I was under the impression that the storyboard implements a state machine, not a stack,  and the visibility of each view controller instance is considered a different state.  is this true?</li> <li>if I create a view controller programmatically, but I also mention it in a storyboard by its class name, am I  allowed to add segues to it and use the segues?</li> <li>if I create a segue in a storyboard and I give it a name, what basic rules would I have to violate to make it such that UIKit  tells me it cannot find that segue?</li> <li>In a storyboard, do all view controllers have to be connected by segues?</li> </ul>
