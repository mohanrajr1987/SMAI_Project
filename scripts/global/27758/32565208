<p>I have tree view controller. when secondViewController showing up, I try to present thirdViewController in this time I want to dismiss secondViewController because whenever I want to try dismiss in thirdViewController I want to see firstViewController not see the second one. here is my code that I have tried</p>  <pre><code>self.presentViewController(thirtVC, animated: true) { () -&gt; Void in                  dispatch_after(0, dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -&gt; Void in                     self.navigationController?.dismissViewControllerAnimated(false, completion: { () -&gt; Void in                      })                 })              } </code></pre>  <p>and it is not working for this case. Please where would be issue.</p>
