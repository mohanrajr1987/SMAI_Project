<p>So in my app we have a <code>UIPageViewController</code> that has a <code>UIToolbar</code> containing a button that when pressed instantiates a new <code>UINavigationController</code> and a <code>UIViewController</code> that is embedded in the nav controller. After this is completed I call <code>[self presentViewController:navController animated:YES completion:nil]</code>. This spikes the CPU and locks up the app.</p>  <p>I set a breakpoint in the <code>UIViewController</code> that is embedded in the <code>UINavigationController</code> that is to be presented and the only call that ever executes is <code>initWithCoder:</code>.</p>  <p>This <strong>ONLY</strong> happens when using Xcode 7 and I have tried stripping it down to bare bones (not doing anything in the presented modal other than loading) but it doesn't help.</p>
