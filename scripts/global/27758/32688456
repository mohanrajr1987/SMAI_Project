<p>I have a strange problem with my app I am developing. The Bar Button Items all disappear at random times.</p>  <p>I have a Navigation Controller with one button (as image) that takes the user to the Menu Table View Controller via push segue.</p>  <p>The Menu Table View Controller has 3 rows, i.e. menu options.</p>  <p>Each menu option takes the user to another View Controller via a push segue. Each view controller has a Back button shown using the default buttons.</p>  <p>It's all a pretty simple straightforward setup without any code.</p>  <p>I have noticed many occasions all the bar button items disappear. No back buttons, no menu button etc. Although I can still tap on the area and the buttons still work - just not visible.</p>  <p>I am not doing anything via code that is hiding the buttons.</p>  <p>I have noticed a number of times if I leave my app in the foreground and the phone goes to sleep, then when I come back the buttons are gone. Not always though.</p>  <p>However this is not the only time the buttons disappear. I have actually seen them disappear whilst using the menu system. But once again there's no code that I can see that is causing this.</p>  <p>I'm currently on iOS9, but it did the same with iOS8.</p>  <p>Any idea what could be the problem?</p>
