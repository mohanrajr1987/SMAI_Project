<p>I have embedded a Navigation Controller within my UiTableViewController in hopes of having a Navigation bar. The navigation bar shows within the storyboard but at runtime it does not display. Has anyone else ran into this problem and can provide a solution? I have read into many Stackoverflow posts but can not find one regarding this problem that works. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/r0bUH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/r0bUH.png" alt="Storyboard"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rOu1k.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rOu1k.png" alt="Storyboard Hiearchy"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6xcMS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6xcMS.png" alt="Runtime"></a></p>
