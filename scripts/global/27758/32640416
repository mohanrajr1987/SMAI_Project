<p>I have integrated MMDrawerController into a project of mine and everything is working great! Now I was trying to only replace part of the main screen (so that the bottom part would be the same across the entire app). To achieve this, I thought of a custom ContainerViewController and only replacing the top container.</p>  <p>This is how I tried to replace the first container: </p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>func replaceContentAndClose(vc: UIViewController) {   var appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as!AppDelegate     // Find containerContent   var centerController = appDelegate.centerContainer!.centerViewController   var centerContainer: AnyObject = centerController.childViewControllers[0]    // Replace it with new VC   vc.view.frame = centerContainer.view!!.frame   centerContainer.willMoveToParentViewController(nil)   centerController.addChildViewController(vc)   centerController.transitionFromViewController(centerContainer as!UIViewController, toViewController: vc, duration: 0.2, options: UIViewAnimationOptions.TransitionCrossDissolve, animations: {}, completion: {     finished in       centerContainer.removeFromParentViewController()     vc.didMoveToParentViewController(centerContainer as ? UIViewController)     vc.view.frame = centerContainer.view!!.bounds   })     appDelegate.centerContainer!.centerViewController = vc   appDelegate.centerContainer!.toggleDrawerSide(MMDrawerSide.Left, animated: true, completion: nil) }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>After a couple hours of not getting it to work the way I wanted it, I read that this library only supports a UINavigationController as the center view controller.</p>  <p>That would be no problem, but the iOS documentation states that replacing does not work with subclasses of UINavigationController :(      -> I'm getting </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Parent view controller is using legacy containment in call to -[UIViewController transitionFromViewController:toViewController:duration:options:animations:completion:]'</p> </blockquote>  <p>as error. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10099395/error-when-attempting-to-set-custom-animation-for-the-viewcontroller-transition">Here</a> it was stated that subclasses of UINavigationController should not be used for that)</p>  <p>Is there any work-around for this? This is crucial for my app and I would really like to keep MMDrawerController by any means.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
