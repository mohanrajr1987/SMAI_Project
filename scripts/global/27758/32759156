<p>I've an application using an adaptive <code>UISplitController</code>. So it behaves as <code>UISplitViewController</code> for horizontal regular sizes and as a <code>UINavigationController</code> for horizontal compact sizes.</p>  <p>The content of the master is a <code>UINavigationController</code>. Its root is a <code>UITableViewController</code>. When pressing one of the rows I push (in the master) a <code>DocumentDetailViewController</code> and, depending on the content I present a specific <code>UIViewController</code> in the detail (<code>showDetailViewController: sender:</code>).</p>  <p>My problem is the following: once I press the back button in the <code>DocumentDetailViewController</code>, I want to reset the content of the right panel, that is the default controller I show when nothing is selected in the table. But, if i do this by calling <code>showDetailViewController: sender:</code> the result is ok for regular size, but wrong for the compact. In this last case, I don't want to do nothing, just want to see the table.</p>  <p>I still haven't found a clean solution for that.</p>
