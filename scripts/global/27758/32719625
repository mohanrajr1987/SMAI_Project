<p>I'm using <code>UIPopoverPresentationController</code> for popovers in an iOS app. When a navigation controller in a popover pushes a new view controller, the popover resizes to that view controller's <code>preferredContentSize</code>.  But when the navigation controller pops a view controller off the stack, the popover does not resize to the previous size. How can I make it do that?</p>  <p>Possible duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2752394/popover-with-embedded-navigation-controller-doesnt-respect-size-on-back-nav">this question</a>, but for the modern <code>UIPopoverPresentationController</code>.</p>  <p><b>Update:</b> See <a href="https://github.com/tomhamming/popover-resizing" rel="nofollow">here</a> for example code illustrating the problem. Clone it and run it in an iPad simulator. Tap the Popover button and you get a popover with a nav controller. Tap the Push bar button item and you get a new taller VC on the stack (the size is in the nav bar). Pop and it doesn't resize back down to what it was.</p>
