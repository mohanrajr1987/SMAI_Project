<p>I'm trying to load a viewcontroller on tap of a button which is present in the xib file. The viewcontroller is embedded in an navigation controller.</p>  <p>Right now i'm doing this i.e.,inside the IBAction() method of xib button.</p>  <p><code>[self showViewController:viewcontroller sender:self];</code></p>  <p>The navigation takes place with all the navigation bar items but no view is getting loaded.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me with this...</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
