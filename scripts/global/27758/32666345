<p>I have multiple UINavigationController throughout my storyboard. Since I am using a tabbarcontroller every tab item has it's own UINavigationController embedded before it's ViewController. </p>  <p>I'd like to style all of these at the same time. Things that I have tried that work are going to a ViewControllers <code>ViewWillAppear</code> method and adding the following lines:</p>  <pre><code>UINavigationBar *nav = self.navigationController.navigationBar; nav.barStyle = UIBarStyleBlack; nav.tintColor = [UIColor blackColor]; nav.translucent = NO; </code></pre>  <p>But then I'd have to do this for every tab item and every ViewController.</p>  <p>Also, doing the following in the AppDelegate did NOT work:</p>  <pre><code>[[UINavigationBar appearance] setTintColor:[UIColor blackColor]]; [[UINavigationBar appearance] setTranslucent:NO]; </code></pre>  <p>Specifically I am curious why using the appearance proxy doesn't work. I'm fairly new so if you give a solution involving custom UINavigationController or setting up a delegate please elaborate. Thanks!</p>
