<p>I have a TabBarController with 3 tabs set up in my storyboard.  I want to have each tab have its own navigation controller.  However, I don't want to embed each one in a nav controller, cluttering the storyboard and then having to style the navigation each time.  Is there any way to do this programatically?  In other words each time a tab is tapped, the resulting view controller will be set as the root of one existing navigation controller?</p>
