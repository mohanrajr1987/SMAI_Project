<p>I'd like to make a navigation bar title (part of a navigation controller) that the user can click on to segue to another screen.  I've done this by adding a button : </p>  <pre><code>-(void)createTappableNavBar {     UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeSystem];     button.titleLabel.text = @"Hello";      button.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];     [button addTarget:self action:@selector(oneFingerOneTap) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];     self.navigationItem.titleView = button; }  -(void)oneFingerOneTap {     NSLog(@"Nav bar button was tapped");     [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"EditChildData" sender:self.childSelected]; } </code></pre>  <p>The navigation bar is clickable, and the segue IS working.  But, I cannot see the title!  I tried changing the background color to green for the button, and I can't see anything.  I know the button must be there, because the NSLog and the segue are working.  Why can't I see the button and the button text?  Thanks. </p>
