<p>In my application i declare my navigation Controller Prior to my app delegate class, it has worked fine over ios7 and iOS 8. But once it came time to upgrade to iOS 9 and Xcode 7, it doesn't seem to want to work. </p>  <p>When my navigation controller is declared before my app delegate class like the following:</p>  <pre><code>var navigationController = UINavigationController()  @UIApplicationMain class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate, CLLocationManagerDelegate { </code></pre>  <p>It doesn't allow me to access my navigation controller in my application did finish launching function:</p>  <pre><code>    self.window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)     let rootViewController: ViewController = ViewController()     navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: rootViewController)     navigationController.setNavigationBarHidden(true, animated: false)     navigationController.view.layer.cornerRadius = 8     navigationController.view.layer.masksToBounds = true     //navigationController.shouldAutomaticallyForwardRotationMethods()     window!.rootViewController = navigationController     window!.makeKeyAndVisible() </code></pre>  <p>What's Stumping me is i can call my navigation controller in any other view with no problem. And also prior to Xcode 7, iOS 9, and swift 2 this also worked fine. </p>  <p>Did something change to swift to not allow this? How do I continue using my navigation controller like this?</p>
