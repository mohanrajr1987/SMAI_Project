<p>I need to publish a webservice that take a variable number of parameters. My problem is that the caller can send only simple parameters (primitive datatype) not xml, array or lists.</p>  <p>So i would like to dynamically generate wsdl so that if the caller try to access my webservice eg <a href="http://myendpoint:myport/baseWsName_numberOfParameter?wsdl" rel="nofollow">http://myendpoint:myport/baseWsName_numberOfParameter?wsdl</a> then a wsdl with a customizable number of parameters is served (and the caller can use that versione of WebService), the parameters can be all of type strings in my scenario</p>  <p>I would like to avoid to manually define a huge number of overload one for any reasonable number of parameters.</p>
