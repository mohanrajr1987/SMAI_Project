<p>I have deployed a JAX-WS web service hosted in a JBoss 7.1.1. The webservice is acceded by a reverse proxy. To access the service from the public internet, it has to be done by the http<strong>s</strong> protocol, but the communication between the reverse proxy and the JBoss is in http. So the host present in the wsdl file is http  <code>&lt;soap:address location="http://example.com/WS"/&gt;</code> and it has to be <code>&lt;soap:address location="https://example.com/WS"/&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>The JBoss configuration is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>modify-wsdl-addres = true   wsdl-host = jbossws.undefined.host </code></pre>  <p>Here is the reference for the webservices configuration: <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Web+services+configuration" rel="nofollow">https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Web+services+configuration</a></p>  <p>But I can find where to force the protocol to be https in the soap addres.</p>
