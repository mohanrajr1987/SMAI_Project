<p>I'm running nginx and php7-fpm and have problems with the SoapClient accepting local wsdl files. I use a local file (like /api/backend/server/reservation/reservation_v012.wsdl) but I get a 502 Bad Gateway error. When I use "file:/" I get an error "failed to load external entity".</p>  <p>__getTypes() is not delivering any types. The 502 Bad Gateway error occurs exactly at this position, when __getTypes() is called.</p>  <p>Any idea why it's not running like it does with PHP 5.3 before?</p>
