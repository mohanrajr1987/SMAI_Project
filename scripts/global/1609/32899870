<p>I have a problem on a website that is getting data through SOAP. I think while waiting for the data, and other people accessing the webpage, apache can't handle all the requests while waiting that long and I am getting high response times.</p>  <p>I am doing the SOAP call with the regular way:</p>  <pre><code>self::$client = new SoapClient($wsdl_url); self::$session = self::$client-&gt;login( $wsdl_usr, $wsdl_key );  self::$client-&gt;call( self::$session, 'product.list', $args ); </code></pre>  <p>I've searched about asynchronous SOAP calls in PHP, but I don't know how I would do it, because I need that data to be shown to the user.</p>  <p>I have wsdl cache activated but still.</p>  <p>Should I use ajax calls to have the client ready with a loader while calling for the content to free Apache? How other ways of handling this could I use?</p>  <p>This SOAP call is made through a local IP already pointing in a private network, I thought this way the time would be much lesser.</p>
