<p>Is there a way to make this possible? </p>  <p>I have created a simple WSDL web service with only one method, I have tested it and it is working.</p>  <p>Now I am creating a DLL and I'm adding the web reference, but when I try to use it on my code I get the following error:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>The "name of the webservice" does not exist in the current context</p> </blockquote>  <p>Other weird thing it looks like the web service files are not loading and I don't see anything else than the web service folder (announcement service)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/erFsE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/erFsE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Checking on the folder I only have 3 files: a <code>.wsdl</code> file, a <code>reference.cs</code> file and a <code>.map</code> file </p>  <p>I don't see the other <code>.xsd</code> and <code>.disco</code> files. </p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong, or is it different to add a web service to a dll than a normal ASP.NET application ? </p>  <p>Thank you </p>
