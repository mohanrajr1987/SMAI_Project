<p>I have created WSDL with name "gapsWSDL.wsdl" locally on my machine and imported to RAD. The WSDL file is present at location WEB-INF/wsdl. I have checked name and location several times. Its correct but still when I run client its giving me error:</p>  <p>"Exception in thread "main" javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: Cannot find 'WEB-INF/wsdl/gapsWSDL.wsdl' wsdl. Place the resource correctly in the classpath."</p>  <p>I have tried to find solution everywhere but have not been able to fix the issue.</p>  <p>I will appreciate if anybody can provide me guidance on this.</p>  <p>Thanks!!</p>
