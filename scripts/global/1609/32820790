<p>I'm trying to develop a SOAP WebService client in Java, and I'm unable to authenticate to it. I have user and password from my provider and the wsdl is this:</p>  <pre><code>https://www.ictower.net/Services/MasterService.svc?wsdl </code></pre>  <p>With eclipse I generate the service clases and a Stub class, but when I try to authenticate, always get this message </p>  <pre><code>An error occurred when verifying security for the message. </code></pre>  <p>I have tried </p>  <pre><code>IMasterServiceProxy ICTService = new IMasterServiceProxy();  MasterServiceLocator  ICTLocator = new MasterServiceLocator();  URL urlServicio = new URL("https://www.ictower.net/Services/MasterService.svc"); BasicHttpBinding_IMasterServiceStub stub = new BasicHttpBinding_IMasterServiceStub(urlServicio, ICTLocator); stub.setUsername("XXXXX"); stub.setPassword("XXXXX"); </code></pre>  <p>I also tried with _setProperty instead of the setters</p>  <pre><code>stub._setProperty(BasicHttpBinding_IMasterServiceStub.USERNAME_PROPERTY, "XXXXX"); stub._setProperty(BasicHttpBinding_IMasterServiceStub.PASSWORD_PROPERTY, "XXXXX"); </code></pre>  <p>but always when I call any service method, always same return (error verifying security...)</p>  <p>I'm completly lost, I have expend hours trying and searching... Any help is welcome</p>
