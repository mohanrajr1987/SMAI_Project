<p>ExactTarget Axis2 Client - I tried the following link to connect the Enterprise API Service of ExactTarget. I didn't succeed. I used the following site to implement basic connection to ExactTarget API.</p>  <p>Connecting to the API using Java and Axis2 <a href="http://help.exacttarget.com/en/technical_library/web_service_guide/getting_started_developers_and_the_exacttarget_api/connecting_to_the_api_using_java_and_axis2/" rel="nofollow">http://help.exacttarget.com/en/technical_library/web_service_guide/getting_started_developers_and_the_exacttarget_api/connecting_to_the_api_using_java_and_axis2/</a></p>  <p>I get the Following error Log</p>  <p>org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: Login failed at org.apache.axis2.util.Utils.getInboundFaultFromMessageContext(Utils.java:531) at org.apache.axis2.description.OutInAxisOperationClient.handleResponse(OutInAxisOperation.java:375) at org.apache.axis2.description.OutInAxisOperationClient.send(OutInAxisOperation.java:421) at org.apache.axis2.description.OutInAxisOperationClient.executeImpl(OutInAxisOperation.java:229) at org.apache.axis2.client.OperationClient.execute(OperationClient.java:165) at com.exacttarget.wsdl.partnerapi.PartnerAPIStub.update(PartnerAPIStub.java:3263) at com.et.phservices.ETPHServices.updateSubscriberToActive(ETPHServices.java:387) at com.et.client.ETClient.main(ETClient.java:19)</p>  <h2>A.  SOAP request for Axis2 standalone application (i.e using SDK)</h2>  <p>We are configuring username(i.e clientId) and password(i.e clientSecret) in standalone application and not the OAuth token. It is assumed by configuring above ones, the token would be generated (which is unique for the given clientId), before it reaches API call.  This is not happening, seems sdk is not creating and sending the token, and is seeing ‘login failure’ error. Not able to reach API call. Debugged to see the SOAP request is not having token in SOAP header before it is executed. So, is the clarification required.</p>  <h2>B.  SOAP request with SOAP-UI tool</h2>  <p>We are configuring fuelOAuth token in SOAP headers, rest of the SOAP request remains same as in (A), which authenticates and reaches the API call.</p>  <p>To make use of sdk, may we either need –  configuring clientId/clientSecret should authenticate  (or)  way to create fuelOAuth token explicitly and pass it in SOAP headers. The CXF client logic to create fuelOAuth token is detailed in ‘FuelSDK-Java-1.0.3’. And we need clarification, if they have similar logic available for Axis2 client that could be re-used with (A) above, and authenticate?</p>
