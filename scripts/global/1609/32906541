<p>I found a question that asks the opposite of what I'm trying to do here.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2142813/adding-methods-to-the-webservice-do-old-clients-need-to-update-web-references">Adding methods to the webservice: do old clients need to update web references?</a></p>  <p>But, basically I have a web service that I inherited and there were originally grand plans but ultimately only a handful of methods were actually being called. I'd like to remove to clean up the code some. </p>  <p>It is used only internally and I can verify the only methods being used. The problem is that I can't update the client wsdl at the moment. So if I remove the calls from the web service but the clients wsdl isn't updated does that cause problems? </p>  <p>Keep in mind I am completely positive these methods aren't used as it's all internal and we control the programs that use the web service. We can update the wsdl for the clients the next time these programs are updated but that will likely be next year.</p>
