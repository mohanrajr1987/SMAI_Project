<p>I have a WCF service deployed in my development and test environment, same code and configuration. However, when I tried to use SOAP UI to test the service, in test environment I don't get parameters of a method, just an empty tag with an operation name. I used the "Export Definition" option in SOAP UI to compare what is downloaded from both environments. One wsdl file from dev points to 3 xsd files, but the same wsdl from test environment points to 3 another wsdl files, shows to be duplicates. There are no xsd files downloaded for test environment.</p>  <p>Can anyone explain what could be the cause of this?</p>
