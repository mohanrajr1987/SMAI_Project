<p>I am in .NET environment and I am supposed to reference and consume a java WebService with a WSDL. </p>  <p>I am not a wsdl master and neither have I done extensive work in WCF but normally WCF has two kind of binding which are BasicHTTP and WSHTTP but it sounds like I am not able to find any details on this looking at the WSDL. instead I do see something like following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;wsdl:port name="SFAPI12" binding="tns:SFAPISoap12Binding"&gt;   &lt;wsdlsoap12:address location="https://api.successfactors.eu:443/sfapi/v1/soap12" /&gt;    &lt;/wsdl:port&gt; </code></pre>  <p>followed by</p>  <pre><code>&lt;wsdl:binding name="SFAPISoapBinding" type="tns:SFAPI"&gt;&lt;wsdlsoap:binding style="document" transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have no idea how to consume it in my C# application. Any ideas?</p>
