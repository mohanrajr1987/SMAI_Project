<p>I have the MinGW install previously working fine with MSYS. They are installed properly and functioning just well.</p>  <p>I installed the PortAudio library and did the install and got the success message after: </p>  <pre><code>./configure make make install  </code></pre>  <p>When I try to compile samples:</p>  <pre><code>c:\c&gt;gcc patest_mono.c -o pa.exe patest_mono.c:50:23: fatal error: portaudio.h: No such file or directory #include "portaudio.h" ^ compilation terminated. </code></pre>  <p>I'm new.  I have a feeling I might be doing something fundamentally wrong with the way I'm trying to create the exe from compiling. It's been somewhat of a puzzle quest so far, but I've tried to figure it out and think I am close but completely missing something.  </p>  <p>PATH variable ?</p>  <p>In the PortAudio MinGW build instructions I noticed</p>  <pre><code>"The above should create a working version though you might want to     provide  'â€“prefix=&lt;path-to-install-dir&gt;' to configure. " </code></pre>  <p>I've tried adding C:\MingW\PortAudio into the user path. Doesn't work.  </p>  <p>I've also tried running the commands in Bash and they come back with an error message "No Rule to make target 'paexpink'" either with the make command, and with gcc .c -o .exe I just get the same error message as compiling straight from the cmd prompt.</p>  <p>I found another source on stack overflow thread with no answers, but the user had commented that <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio" rel="nofollow">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio</a> provided them a solution but I tried installing the 5 cpython binaries and under the assumption I did it right, it didn't work either.  </p>  <p>Thanks for your help, Julian</p>
