<p>I've been fighting for a month solid to build a //working// C++/gtkmm-3.0 application on Windows with MinGW. I finally managed to get the libraries, MinGW, and Codeblocks to get along on Windows XP (VirtualBox). However, when I try to build, I get the following errors.</p>  <p>These are the most recent versions of gtkmm-3.0 and dependencies. I got them via MSYS2, though I cannot build in that environment for reasons yet unknown. So, as is oft recommended, I copied them over to the MinGW <code>/lib</code> and <code>/include</code> directories, and ensured <code>pkg-config</code> could find them. All's well there (allegedly).</p>  <p>These problems are not originating from my code, obviously. I didn't write or modify gtkmm. Yet, I can't get these to go away.</p>  <p>It is worth mentioning that I was last getting errors relating to "cannot find glib::ustring::ustring", and it decided to stop whining about that and give me these out of the blue instead. If the earlier messages ever show up again, I'll post them here.</p>  <p>I'm beginning to think it isn't worth releasing this software on Windows at all.</p>  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am getting over 50 of these, all in gtkmm-3.0 and its dependency libraries, all originating from line 1 or 2 of main, and all with the exact same details. I'll show only a few in interest of space.</p>  <pre><code>-------------- Build: Debug in infiltrator (compiler: GNU GCC Compiler)---------------  mingw32-g++.exe -std=c++11 -Wall -mms-bitfields
