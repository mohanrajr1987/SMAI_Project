<p>I had written below code in C. I expected error message since array size cannot be allocated dynamically. But the code compiles. But the result size of myArray1 is absurd. I am not sure why it compiles. I am using codeblock and minGW.</p>  <pre><code>   int a;     printf("Enter the value for a\n");     scanf("%d",&amp;a);     int myArray2[a];     printf("value of a = %d\tSize of myArray1 = %d",(sizeof(myArray2)/sizeof(myArray2[0]))); </code></pre>
