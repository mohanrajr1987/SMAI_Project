<p>I have installed the MinGW compiler and I am attempting to run a C++ QT Application from within Netbeans.</p>  <p>As you can see from this screenshot, I have successfully set up the native build tools using Netbeans:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lJduV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lJduV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Unfortunately when attempting to run my program, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>make.exe": /bin/sh: Command not found make.exe": /bin/sh: Command not found make.exe": *** [.validate-impl] Error 127  BUILD FAILED (exit value 2, total time: 303ms) </code></pre>  <p>Just to be clear, I am not running a complicated program, in fact, I am just trying to execute a basic generated main file:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;QApplication&gt;  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {     // initialize resources, if needed     // Q_INIT_RESOURCE(resfile);      QApplication app(argc, argv);      // create and show your widgets here      return app.exec(); } </code></pre>  <p>You can download my Makefile-Debug and Makefile-impl here: <a href="http://wikisend.com/download/467700/makefiles.zip" rel="nofollow">http://wikisend.com/download/467700/makefiles.zip</a></p>  <p>I would be extremely grateful for your help.</p>
