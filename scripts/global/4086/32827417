<p>I installed gcc with the GUI installer MinGW Installation Manager. After it installed the basics, I manually checked and installed mingw32-binutils and mingw32-gcc. I added the directory to my path. I can use the command in powershell. If I use gcc alone I get an error because i didn't input any file, if I put in a .txt it tells me it's not recognized. So that part works as it should. </p>  <p>However once I put a file, main.c, whether or not it's real code (basic main with hello world) or a random string or character, absolutely nothing happens, no message, and the command terminates. So basically I enter gcc and the prompt immediately asks for another command. I reinstalled it twice.</p>  <p>The command: </p>  <pre><code>gcc -o a.exe main.c </code></pre>  <p>I'm using Windows 10 if that can help.</p>
