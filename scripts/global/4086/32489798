<p>Trying to get a test case working so that I can compile C++ using scons.</p>  <p>However I am getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>scons: Reading SConscript files ... scons: done reading SConscript files. scons: Building targets ...  scons: warning: No version of Visual Studio compiler found - C/C++ compilers most likely not set correctly File "C:\Python27\Scripts\scons.py", line 199, in &lt;module&gt; C:/Qt/Tools/mingw492_32/bin/g++.exe -o test.o -c test.cpp scons: *** [test.o] Error 1 scons: building terminated because of errors. </code></pre>  <p>Here is my SConstruct at this time:</p>  <pre><code>env = Environment(tools = ["mingw"],  TARGET_ARCH=['x86']) env.Replace(CXX = 'C:/Qt/Tools/mingw492_32/bin/g++.exe') env.Program("main","test.cpp") </code></pre>  <p>I am confused by the visual studio error, because I have specified that I want to use mingw.</p>
