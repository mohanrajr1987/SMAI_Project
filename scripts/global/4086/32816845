<p>I am getting the output "ma" on executing the following code. If my understanding is correct, local variable is not initialized to 0. So in such a case, how come %s is finding 0 in a1[2] itself? Is that we cannot predict the output in such cases and I am somehow getting this result and this may not be the case always?</p>  <pre><code>int main(void) {     char a1[10];     a1[0]='m';     a1[1]='a';     a1[3]='j';     printf("%s",a1);     return(0); } </code></pre>
