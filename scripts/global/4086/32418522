<p>I'm writing a program in C for an assignment and I'd like to work on it on my Windows 10 desktop, however I'm encountering a strange issue when using MinGW.</p>  <p>The program I have written is as seen below:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main(){     //set up variables     int a, b, c, d;      //prompt user for integers     printf("Please enter four different integers:\n");     scanf("%d", &amp;a);     scanf("%d", &amp;b);     scanf("%d", &amp;c);     scanf("%d", &amp;d);      //return sum     int sum = a+b+c+d;     printf("Sum is: %d", sum);      return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>When I compile this, the output looks like this: (Where 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the inputted numbers)</p>  <pre><code>1 2 3 4 Please enter four different integers:  Sum is: 10 </code></pre>  <p>This obviously should not happen because that's out of order. To try and troubleshoot, I compiled this same code using GCC on my laptop running Arch and the output looked like this: (Where 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the inputted numbers)</p>  <pre><code>Please enter four different integers: 1 2 3 4  Sum is: 10 </code></pre>  <p>This is what the output <em>should</em> look like. I am using Eclipse Mars as an IDE on both the Linux and the Windows computers. I also tried the same on my other laptop that dual boots Windows 10 and Ubuntu and had the same results between MinGW and GCC.</p>  <p>If anyone has any ideas why MinGW would be acting this way I'd greatly appreciate it! Thanks!</p>
