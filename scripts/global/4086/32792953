<p>I am trying make/install inkscape on WinXp.  Although I am rather inexperienced on this subject, I have a reasonably well developed MingW infrastructure, and have successfully built/installed a variety of packages, such as Cairo, Pango, GTK+, Glade, etc.</p>  <p>At the moment I am trying to make/install inkscape.  Following a huge amount of work, it all configures and compiles, with  MSys:</p>  <pre><code>cd ${LOCALBUILDDIR} &amp;&amp; \ cd inkscape-0.91 &amp;&amp; \ ./configure --prefix=${LOCALDESTDIR} CFLAGS='-std=gnu++11' CXXFLAGS='-std=gnu++11' &amp;&amp; \ make CFLAGS='-std=gnu++11' CXXFLAGS='-std=gnu++11' &amp;&amp; \ make install </code></pre>  <p>and after successful config/compile I use</p>  <pre><code>cd ${LOCALBUILDDIR} &amp;&amp; \ cd inkscape-0.91 &amp;&amp; \ make CFLAGS='-std=gnu++11' CXXFLAGS='-std=gnu++11' &amp;&amp; \ make install </code></pre>  <p>to prevent recreating/overwriting the config etc files for the edits discussed below.</p>  <p>This fails on the link with:</p>  <pre><code>make[3]: Entering directory `/build32/inkscape-0.91/src'   CXXLD    inkscape.exe libtool: link: cannot find the library `/usr/lib/libintl.la' or unhandled argument `/usr/lib/libintl.la' </code></pre>  <p>At no time ever have I had any Dir's called "/usr".  I appreciate that is the default on Unix etc, but my installation has its libs in D:/Apps/MingW/local32/lib", and which certainly includes libintl.la (and all the required gettext and libintl bits, as it would need for the success with all the other packages).  Indeed, the inkscape configure and compile steps report finding libintl etc. correctly.  Also, it obtains the path correctly for the compiler, etc. as it would need to for the success with the compiler.</p>  <p>I am guessing that somewhere in the inkscape configure/in/ac/m4 etc bits, it has hard-wired, or something, the link step for libintl for Unix default.  I have tried many permutations to manually alter "/usr/lib" lines in the config and libtool files, but obtain the same link crash.</p>  <p>I would be grateful for any hints as to where to look for/correct this in inkscape (or even generally).</p>
