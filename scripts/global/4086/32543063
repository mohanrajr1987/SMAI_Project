<p>I've spent hours googling this, but haven't been able to find any answers.  I'm trying to install a package for Python 3.4, but keep running into problems.  First, I tried just running "python setup.py install":</p>  <pre><code>running install running build running build_py running build_ext error: Python was built with Visual Studio 2003; extensions must be built with a compiler than can generate compatible binaries. Visual Studio 2003 was not found on this system. If you have Cygwin installed, you can try compiling with MingW32, by passing "-c mingw32" to setup.py. </code></pre>  <p>After a long time of searching, I downloaded mingw, added C:/MinGW/bin to my path, made sure MinGW has gcc, and made my distutils.cfg file with [build] and compiler = mingw32 in it.  On running python setup.py install again, I got the same error.</p>  <p>I tried what it suggested, passing -c mingw32 to setup.py.  It can't do it for setup.py install, so I did setup.py build:</p>  <pre><code>python setup.py build -c mingw32 running build running build_py running build_ext </code></pre>  <p>That all seems well and good, but when I try to install after building it tries to build it all over again, and because I can't pass in the compiler for some reason it fails.</p>  <p>How can I get setup.py to work?  If it helps, I'm trying to install the <a href="https://github.com/caseman/noise" rel="nofollow">noise</a> package, and am using Windows Vista 64-bit (I don't have much money...).</p>
