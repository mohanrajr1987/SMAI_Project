<p>I am facing a problem because of high overhead of pthread_create. I have looked the internet for a good threadpool library, but I didn't find one that suits my project, or they simply did not work. </p>  <p>I am quite new to c++, and my programming skills are pretty basic, but good. I programmed a lot (over 5 years), I just did not do any object oriented projects or even used data structures. </p>  <p>I would really appreciate any material or guides that can help me get the experience and knowledge needed to create my own thread pool. </p>  <p>Due to constraints in my current project, I will work on normal c++ (not C++11) on a windows 10 (mingw32) and I have to avoid using any boost libraries.</p>  <p>as requested: About the problem: </p>  <p>I am writing a computational expensive project. I want to make it run faster, so I decided to use pthreads.  The problem, however, is that the thread creation is inside a loop, and pthread_create is called 64 times. </p>  <p>After a lot of research and trying I figured out that threadpools are the solution here, but I spent over 3 days getting the implementations I found online to work, but to no avail, so I decided to write my own thread pool implementation. </p>  <p>About an example of the code you can check: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32429543/how-can-i-reduce-the-effect-of-pthread-join-mingw32-c">How can I reduce the effect of pthread_join. Mingw32, c++</a></p>  <p>But there I realized its the thread create, not thread_join that causes the performance to worsen.</p>
