<p>I wrote very simple <code>Makefile</code> to show problem which I got. Please take a look:</p>  <p>Makefile:</p>  <pre><code>.PHONY: clean  clean:     -rmdir /S /Q not_existing_directory &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1 </code></pre>  <p>Running this <code>Makefile</code> with command <code>make clean</code> doesn't redirects errors from <code>rmdir</code> to the <code>NULL</code> device. The interesting thing is that running the same command from <code>cmd.exe</code> works as expected, namely it hides errors. My question is why is it happening ? </p>  <p>This error manifested on Windows 7 32-bit version as <code>make</code> I'm using <code>mingw</code> from <a href="http://www.mingw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mingw.org/</a> in following version:</p>  <pre><code>GNU Make 3.82.90 Built for i686-pc-mingw32 </code></pre>  <p>Here are also my enviromental variables which I'm setting through batch file:</p>  <p>setenv.bat:</p>  <pre><code>set PATH=C:\Windows\system32;C:\Program Files\COSMIC\CXSTM8;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\Program Files\Vim  %comspec% /k PATH </code></pre>  <p>I would really appreciate your help. </p>
