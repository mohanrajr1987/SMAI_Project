<p>I have the following setup:</p>  <ul> <li>Eclipse Mars 4.5 (Build id:20150621-1200)</li> <li>MinGW 201310 with g++ 4.8.1</li> <li>Windows 10</li> </ul>  <p>I followed few post to add std=c++11 in Project property and make sure __cplusplus is 201103L. Here is the result:</p>  <ul> <li>I can see that std::map compile and run ok. </li> <li>If I #include , there is no syntax error. But the declaration of thread in main() shows error "Type thread could not be resolved". Then I open up thread header file located in c:/MinGW/lib/gcc/mingw32/4.8.1/include/c++/thread, it seems that the whole class is dimmed due to that _GLIBCXX_HAS_GTHREADS is undefined. If I manually define it in the path and symbols, then the thread class is fully defined. But there comes more errors in the thread itself. Did I missed something? Or if the C++11 thread isn't ready on eclipse+MinGW? Thank you!</li> </ul>
