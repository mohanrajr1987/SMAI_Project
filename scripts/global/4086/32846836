<p>Basically I want to code in my free time but my school's computer doesn't allow any programs to be installed or any changes to be made in its settings. I want to run sublime text and MinGW from my USB only. How do I configure sublime text so that when I use a keyboard shortcut to open terminal MinGW is already in the path?</p>
