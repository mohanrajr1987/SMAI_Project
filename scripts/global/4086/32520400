<p>I try to use GDAL library in MinGW on a Windows 7 system. I downloades the GDAL 2.0.0 from gdal.org and did the built and install like described here: <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingWithMinGW" rel="nofollow">https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingWithMinGW</a>. This worked fine without any errors. When I now try to include gdal.h or gdal_priv.h in a C++ file msys says: fatal error: gdal.h: no such file or directory. Did I forget anything? Do I need to place the built dll files anywhere else?  Thank you very much for your help! Cheers, Joachim</p>
