<p>The preferred method for reading from a channel using the Tcl API is <code>Tcl_ReadChars()</code>. When reading from a binary channel, the data will be stored as a byte array until referenced, at which point conversions will be done.</p>  <p>I then have a set of functions for retrieving data from the object: <code>Tcl_Get{String,Double,Int}FromObj()</code>. However, if I read in a float, it seems that none of these will do the right thing to extract the value I intended.</p>  <p>At this point, I am trying to reason from the documentation. It may be the case that <code>Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj()</code> will be flexible enough to handle this case... but that doesn't seem to be the case based on the documentation.</p>  <p>Using the Tcl C API, how should I read a float from a binary file?</p>
