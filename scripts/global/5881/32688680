<p>Is it possible to <strong>find the procedure name by using the content</strong> of that procedure?</p>  <p>For example,</p>  <pre><code>proc test {args} {     set varA "exam"     puts "test program" } </code></pre>  <p>Using the statement <code>set varA</code>, is it possible to find its procedure name test?</p>  <p>Because, I need to find a procedure for which i know the output [it's printing something, i need to find the procedure using that].</p>  <p>I tried many ways like <code>info frame</code>, <code>command</code>. But, nothing helps.</p>
