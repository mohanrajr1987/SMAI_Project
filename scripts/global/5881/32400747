<p>I'm trying to extract a sequence of characters from a string in TCL.<br> Say, I have <code>"blahABC:blahDEF:yadamsg=abcd"</code>. <br> I want to extract the substring starting with <code>"msg="</code> until I reach the end of the string.<br>  Or rather I am interested in extracting <code>"abcd"</code> from the above example string.<br> Any help is greatly appreciated.<br> Thanks.<br></p>
