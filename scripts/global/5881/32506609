<p>I am attempting to use the now venerable <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/tkdiff/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/tkdiff" rel="nofollow">tkdiff</a> tool, but have run into a snag.  I have 2 Linux systems.  The first system, a Redhat EL 6.4 workstation, runs tkdiff perfectly fine--I can diff files all day long.</p>  <p>On a second system, a CentOS release 6.6 server, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/tkdiff/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/tkdiff" rel="nofollow">tkdiff</a> fails with the following stack trace:</p>  <pre><code>Error in startup script:      while executing "font actual system"     invoked from within "set sysfont [font actual system]"     (file "&lt;path...&gt;/bin/tkdiff" line 122) </code></pre>  <p>I don't know why it's not giving me an error message between the ":" and "while executing"...very strange.</p>  <p>I'm scratching my head on this one, I've tried a few things such as:</p>  <ul> <li>replacing the <code>!#/bin/sh</code> shebang with <code>#!/usr/bin/wish</code></li> <li>updating the <code>package require Tk</code> statement to 8.5</li> <li>Running wish, then sourcing tkdiff from inside wish: curiously, <em>this gives no errors!</em>  But it is not practical because it would be very cumbersome to specify the diff files and run this way.</li> </ul>  <p>I'm guessing I might be missing some other dependancy on my CentOS server?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>  <p>Okay, it's definitely a dependency thing.  My brain is a little foggy on the details, but I recall there being some subtle differences when sourcing from the <code>wish</code> prompt vs just running a script, as far as error handling.  The root seems to probably be a missing font dependency, as this experiment shows:</p>  <pre><code>$ wish % font actual system % puts $errorInfo      while executing "font actual system" % puts $errorCode NONE %  </code></pre>  <p>Clearly it is not happy about <code>font actual system</code>.  Curiously, the <code>$errorCode</code> is <code>NONE</code>.  The libXft and fontconfig packages were previously installed.  And I just installed the following additional yum packages:</p>  <pre><code>xorg-x11-utils libXv libXxf86dga libdmx tk-devel (which installed fontconfig-devel and a bunch of other dependancies) tcl-devel </code></pre>
