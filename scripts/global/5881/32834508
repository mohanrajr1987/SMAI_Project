<p>Is it possible to create a button, for example, whose callback takes a parameters?</p>  <p>e.g.</p>  <pre><code>button(-text =&gt; 'Row1', -command =&gt; \&amp;do_something_with('Row 1')); </code></pre>  <p>Tried it on a test program and it doesn't seem to. If that is the case, is there some other way to do what I intend with the example above?</p>  <p>My program needs to create buttons but the number is not known beforehand (depends on a .cfg file).</p>
