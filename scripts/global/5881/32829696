<p>I'm looking for a way in tcl expect to simulate pressing "enter" the script (for example after some outputs the script stops, and only after I manually press "enter" it goes further) It wait's for a "enter" key to be pressed from the user before continuing outputting the remaining script.</p>  <p>Here is my code where I have this problem:</p>  <pre><code>set timeout 20 set f [open "password.txt" r] set password [read $f] close $f  foreach i $password {  puts "trying this as a pass : $i" spawn ssh user@exemple.net -p 724 expect "user@exemple.net's password:" send $i interact } </code></pre>  <p>This code takes from the <code>password.txt</code> all the words it contains and trye's them as the password for the user@exemple.net; The code works but after this line from the code above <code>expect "user@example.net's password:"</code> I need to press manually "enter" button and then the script goes with the next try.</p>  <p>How can I simulate this enter. Is there any command that simulates it?  I am new to tcl expect. Thank you for your time.</p>
