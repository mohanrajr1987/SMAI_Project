<p>I'm working on a tcltk interface in R that creates a set of drop down combo boxes based on the fields in whichever dataset is loaded by the user. Right now I have a button ("getbox") to press after loading the data that reads the data then creates a combo box with an option for each field. I'd like to be able to re-create the combo box each time I press the button instead of adding a new combo box. Here is an example of what I have:</p>  <pre><code>tt &lt;- tktoplevel() comboframe &lt;- tkframe(tt)     getbox &lt;- tkbutton(tt, text = "Create Combo Box", command = function() {         fields &lt;- names(mtcars)         cbox &lt;- tkwidget(comboframe, "ComboBox", editable = FALSE, values = fields)         tkgrid(cbox)          })     tkgrid(getbox)    tkgrid(comboframe) </code></pre>  <p>I tried adding an if statement in the getbox command function, but couldn't get it to work. </p>  <pre><code>if (exists(comboframe)) {     tkdestroy(comboframe) }  # then create combobox ... </code></pre>  <p>Any thoughts on how to replace the combo box instead of adding a new one? Thanks!</p>
