<p>I have the following value defined in my main.sv that only needs to be set once:</p>  <pre><code>logic [31:0] random_number; </code></pre>  <p>I don't want to waste resources randomizing this value in synthesized HDL so it occurred to me that I might be able to do so in a Tcl script. My goals are to either:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Use a Tcl script to rewrite the HDL file with the value initialized as such:</p>  <p><code>logic [31:0] random_number = 32'd1057;</code></p></li> <li><p>Use a Tcl script to set the value to the net in a pre-hook.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Unfortunately, Im unsure how to use tcl do any of these things. Any advise would be appreciated.</p>
