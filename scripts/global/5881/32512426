<p>I want to read multiple files about 30 files in a directory through for loop in TCL and for each file I want to do something, e.g. load, run, inst.</p>  <p>I want to do some thing like:</p>  <pre><code>set hosts [open "wcet_executable/*.exe"] foreach host $hosts {     load *.exe     run     inst } </code></pre>  <p>I am doing something wrong as I have no good experience in TCL, and the problem is I want to do this in TCL.</p>
