<p>This pertains to Tcl 8.5 Say I have a very large dictionary. From performance points of view (memory footprint, etc), assuming that I do not modify the dictionary, should upvar provide a massive performance improvement in terms of memory? I am using an EDA tool, which has TCL shell, but the vendor disabled the TCL memory command. I know that Tcl can share strings under the hood for performance... The same dictionary can be passed several nested procs' calls. Thanks.</p>
