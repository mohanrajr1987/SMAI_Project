<p>I'm trying to append two string in tcl. I'm reading from csv and set values to the variables and then i will use that for assigning it my application. I tried the below one.</p>  <pre><code>set vMyvalue [lindex $lsLine 17] append vMyvalue " [lindex $lsLine 18]" </code></pre>  <p>it is giving me the expected result. Like for e.g if i have values <strong>250</strong> and <strong>km</strong> in 17th and 18th position in csv. i'm getting</p>  <pre><code>250 km </code></pre>  <p>But the problem is when there are no values in the 17th and 18th i mean when it is empty, that time also it is adding <strong>space</strong>. But my application won't allow me to assign space for that value. How can i resolve this? I just started working in TCL. I'm not aware of many functions.</p>
