<p>I am trying to search information if inter process communication can happen with tcl threads. I am biginner on this topic so right now just collecting information. I understand that sender and receiver mechanism to be coded to pass data between processess. And tcl thread package provides send command. Also thread can be used as timer for spawn process inside the same. Is it possible to recieve data from thread to another thread? Thanking you.</p>  <pre><code>#contains of test.tcl puts stdout "hello from wish" # end of file  # set cmd set exe {wish85.exe}  set exepath [list $exe test.tcl]  # This next line is slightly magical set f [open |$exepath r+] # Use the next line or you'll regret it! puts $f {fconfigure stdout -buffering line}  fileevent $f readable "getline $f" proc getline f {         if {[gets $f line]&lt;0} {             close $f ;            return ;         } puts "line=$line" }  </code></pre>
