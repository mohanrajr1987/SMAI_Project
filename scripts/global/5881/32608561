<p>I have a template file for F5, I cannot seem to figure out how to read the current administrative partition and set it as a variable and then call that variable in the path where the template file will be installed to in the Macro section of the template. </p>  <pre><code>sys application template /{the partition}/Mytemplate { </code></pre>  <p>Using TCL does not seem to be supported in the MACRO, as I get an error when trying to SET a variable. </p>  <p>So the solution that I though would work is to simply create a small program that contains all my code for the template file, display an input dialog box, set input as a variable and call the variable back when outputting the template code back out to a file with .tmlp extension:</p>  <pre><code>(pre code)   (pre code)  sys application template /%the_partition_variable%/Mytemplate {  (post code)  ...  (post code) </code></pre>  <p>Would this even be possible or am I barking up the wrong tree by going this route? Do you have any suggestion for what program I could try to do this in so my code won't conflict with the program.</p>  <p>The simple solution would be to manually add the partition name to the to the path, but I do not want this file to be manually edited, only by an automated means.</p>
