<p>I am trying to use the <code>atomselect</code> command to delete lipids within an area of proteins in my <code>.gro</code> file. Since it is a martini coarse grained file I can just use the keywords <code>resname</code> for residuenames, and <code>name</code> or <code>type</code> for bead-types (my pseudoatoms). So the default singlewords are not defined. </p>  <p>I tried it with the command:</p>  <pre><code>atomselect 0 "all not resname DPPE DOPE POPE POPG within 1 of resname ALA ARG ASN ASP CYS GLN GLU GLY HIS ILE LEU LYS MET PHE PRO SER THR TRP TYR VAL" </code></pre>  <p>and got the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR) Selection terminated too early</p>      <p>ERROR) syntax error atomselect: cannot parse selection text: all not resname DPPE DOPE POPE POPG within 1 of resname ALA ARG ASN ASP CYS GLN GLU GLY HIS ILE LEU LYS MET PHE PRO SER THR TRP TYR VAL</p> </blockquote>  <p>so apparently I didn't get the syntax right. I tried a few different versions and to store the <code>resname</code> selections in variables, but nothing worked. How could I solve this problem?</p>
