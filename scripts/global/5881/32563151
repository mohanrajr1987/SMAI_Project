<p>I am trying to define a TCL regex wildcard search expression that starts the search "foo" then a whitespace character and "bar", then followed by any number of any characters. </p>  <pre><code>set filename "file.txt" set in [open $filename r]  set foolist ""  while {[gets $in line] &gt; -1} {  set matchTuples [regexp -all -inline -- "^foo bar .*\$" $line]  puts $matchTuples  lappend foolist $matchTuples }  set foolist [join $foolist] set foolength [llength $foolist] puts "$foolength"  puts "$foolist"   sh-4.3$ cat file.txt   foo bar 1 foo bar abc 2 foo bar abc 3 </code></pre>  <p>The same example, if I have multiple lines and run a foreach loop and run the regex through the each of the line and lappend the value of <strong>matchTuples</strong> with some global variable., say. globalFoo</p>  <p>Outside the loop, if I check the length of globalFoo, it is returning 0. Am I missing something here? New to TCL and regex, some patience appreciated.</p>
