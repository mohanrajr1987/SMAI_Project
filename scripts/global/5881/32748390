<p>Does anyone know why the expect variable $expect_out(buffer) is empty for the following code?</p>  <p>Several SO threads say it's supposed to contain the output of the last send command.  Why is the variable empty, then?</p>  <p>Example below:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/expect  spawn ssh $MY_NODE  # Logs in # Does stuff  expect "$" send "$MY_COMMAND\r" # Prints i7 puts $expect_out(buffer)  # Empty, even though it should clearly be i7 </code></pre>
