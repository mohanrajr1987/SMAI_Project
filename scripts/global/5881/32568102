<p>Wrote an expect script to kickoff a build and it works perfectly.  At least, until I started calling it from Jenkins.  </p>  <p>I originally wrote the script to use the <code>interaction</code> command, to give control back to the user when the script inside the expect script is finished.  Jenkins finishes the script too early, however.  (<code>interaction</code> command does not work with Jenkins).</p>  <p>Then I changed the script to use <code>expect eof</code> then <code>wait</code>, however, now Jenkins never terminates the script.  It just runs forever.</p>  <p>My script looks like this.</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/expect  #This script never finishes send "KICKOFF_OFF_BUILD.ksh LOCATION\r" expect eof wait </code></pre>  <p>Is there anyway to change this so Jenkins recognizes the job is finished when the korn shell script inside the expect script above finishes?</p>
