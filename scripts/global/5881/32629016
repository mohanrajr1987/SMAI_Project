<p>I want to use the pidof by a process given by name in tcl. I have used <code>[exec pidof $proc_name ]</code>, but it always returns an error: <em>child process exited abnormally</em>.</p>  <p>I read somewhere <code>exec</code> always treat non-zero return as error as pidof return the process id number. Does anyone know if there is a workaround? Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>I want to use pidof is that i want to see if that process is running if not i will restart the process.</p>
