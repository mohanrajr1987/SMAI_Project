<p>I am trying to generate a standalone executable from a single tcl file. I am using the method using tclkit.exe mentioned in <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/11861" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.tcl.tk/11861</a>.</p>  <p>The problem is the tcl file uses 3 packages.</p>  <pre><code>package require Tk package require tcom package require Img </code></pre>  <p>I was not able to successfully add the packages in lib folder of the generated vfs folder. Whenever I click the exe it says, failed to load tcom.dll.</p>  <p>Btw, there are lot of different version of activestate tcl and tclkit.exe based on x86 and x64 system. I am doing the whole thing in a 64 bit win7 system. What am I doing wrong? please help.</p>
