<p>I have to <code>puts</code> large amounts of data to a file in TCL, and it takes very long. I tried increasing the buffer capacity from 4KB to 1MB using <code>fconfigure</code>, but noticed no improvement whatsoever.</p>  <p>I am not sure if I could <code>flush</code> my buffer at intervals, as I was guessing some of my data would be lost if I do so.</p>  <p>Is there some way I could increase the speed of puts without losing any data?</p>
