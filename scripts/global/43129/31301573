<p>I have two tables in sql (Singer, Albums) now my query is as below</p>  <pre><code>IQuerable&lt;AlbumVM&gt; = (     from c in context.Singers      join d in context.Albums on c.SingerID equals d.SingerID     select new AlbumVM()     {          SingerName = c.SignerName,         AlbumsName = d.AlbumName     } ); </code></pre>  <p>Now suppose a singer has 50 columns,this query returns me 50 rows, then I need to iterate through it.</p>  <p><strong>I feel I am missing something here.</strong> Is there someway in which I can get just one record as</p>  <pre><code>SingerName , Albums[] </code></pre>  <p>I am using Entity framework code-first.</p>
