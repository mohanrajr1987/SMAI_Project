<p>I have a many to many relationiship, but as I'm using EF, I don't have the junction table, because it doesn't have a primary key.</p>  <p>Usually, if TableAB had a primary key, I'd make it like this:</p>  <pre><code>var query = from a in db.TableA             join ab in db.TableAB on             a.Id equals ab.Id_TableA             join b in db.TableB on             ab.Id_TableB equals b.Id             select { a.Field, b.Field }; </code></pre>  <p>But, as I don't have mapped the TableAB, what is the correct way to do the JOIN?</p>  <p>I've already created the navigation properties, using API fluent mapping. But using navigation properties to get data, the performance it's worse, or not?</p>  <p>Edit: I'm using POCO.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
