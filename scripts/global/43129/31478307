<p>Our SQL DBA has pointed out that EF is generating some SQL that is causing implicit conversion and is leading to some performance problems.  When I run the web application locally, I see a different query than the stage/production servers are generating.  I am assuming that there are EF differences between my dev box and the server and need help determining where to look.  I have verified the queries in SQL Profiler.</p>  <p>Local: Windows 7, 64-bit, IIS 7</p>  <p>Servers: Windows Server 2003, 32-bit, IIS 6</p>  <p>Linq statement (<em>incoming</em> is a List of type string):</p>  <pre><code>var result = from i in context.ProductImages                          where incoming.Contains(i.productID)                          select i;             var sql = ((System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery)result).ToTraceString();              return result.ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>Local generated query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [Extent1].[column1], [Extent1].[column2], ..rest of columns... WHERE [Extent1].[productID] IN ('000176725','000176726','000176728') </code></pre>  <p>Server generated query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [Extent1].[column1], [Extent1].[column2], ..rest of columns... WHERE [Extent1].[productID] IN (N'000176725',N'000176726',N'000176728') </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas on where to investigate to determine what is causing the generation difference?  the "N'" is causing the performance challenge.</p>  <p>As far as I can tell, the System.Data.Entity dll is the same version (4.0.30319.1)</p>
