<p>I am trying to install Entity Framework 4 in Visual Studio 2013 to use with an ASP.NET MVC 4 application but the Package Manager Console is unable to find it.</p>  <p>I would post a screenshot showing the error but I am not allowed since my rep is less than 10?. Anyway the error I am getting says:</p>  <pre><code>Install-Package : Unable to find version '4.3.1' of package 'EntityFramework'.At line:1 char:1 </code></pre>  <p>For that matter I have tried searching for several different versions including version 6.1.3 with no luck. Am I doing anything wrong here?.</p>  <p>I have been Googling this issue for a couple of hours now but all I can find is these two questions that are a little different and to no help for me.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19923156/how-to-use-entity-framework-4-with-visual-studio-2013">How to Use Entity Framework 4 with Visual Studio 2013</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24214854/visual-studio-2013-and-entity-framework-4">Visual Studio 2013 and Entity Framework 4</a></p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>Alright so today at home I first tried again to install EntityFramework (as well as many other packages) from the Packet Manager Console just like yesterday. Still no luck. Then I tried the exact same thing on my home computer which runs the exact same version of Visual Studio 2013. Here I had no problems at all. Came through at first try.</p>  <p>Then I got back to my work computer and tried again and this time it worked. And now I can not reproduce the problem. But why? I did nothing different on the two computers. My theory is that the infrastructure at my workplace might have blocked some necessary ports for Visual Studio to work properly. Today I was doing it while connected to my home network. But then again - it did not work the first couple of times I tried again. So this problem may be inexplainable.</p>
