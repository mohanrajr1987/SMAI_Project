<p>I'm working on an application that uses Entity Framework 4.0 (and as far as i know we cannot change it). </p>  <p>I need to make deep copies of object, in the case the users selects and object it will get a full copy assigned to him, with all the navigation properties and all created.</p>  <p>I know that in entity framework 4.1 and later version i could use de <strong>AsNoTracking</strong> and then just add it, but i don't know how to do it in entity framework 4.0.  Is there any easy way?</p>  <p>Edit: Thanks to what @PanagiotisKanavos said i realized that what i really wanted was to detach the entity. It kind of solved my problem but not completly, doing:</p>  <pre><code>ctx.Set.Detach(entity)  </code></pre>  <p>Detached the entity but i lost all the associations, so any idea how to detach the rest of the association graph?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: After a lot of experiments i've run out of ideas, i've tried to deep clone, and detatch but when i Add i gives me and exception.</p>  <p>If i only detach i lose all associations so any idea ?</p>
