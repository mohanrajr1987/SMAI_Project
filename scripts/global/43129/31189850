<p>I am using MVC3, C#, .NET4.5 and EF6.1. I upgraded, my model project, to EF 6.1.3 via Nuget, and now getting the following error, when running the app from VS/dev web server.</p>  <pre><code>The current model no longer matches the model used to pre-generate  the mapping views, as indicated by the  ViewsForBaseEntitySets07df622947bb4519acb6b8449dd913f3.MappingHashValue  property. Pre-generated mapping views must be either regenerated using the  current model or removed if mapping views generated at runtime should be  used instead. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=318050 for more  information on Entity Framework mapping views. </code></pre>  <p>I use Devart Entity Developer to produde the PO code and the pregenerated views. Prior to upgrading to EF 6.1.3, all the code worked fine.</p>  <p>Has anybody had this experience, or suggest a cause and solution?</p>  <p>Thanks in advanced.</p>
