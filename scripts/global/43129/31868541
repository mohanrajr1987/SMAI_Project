<p>I have a program which I had written long time back to populate the date dimension. I want to now change the design a bit and use natural date key as primary key, instead of autoincremented int. I was hoping of writing a simple function to generate date in the format 20150806 in YYYYMMDD format. Now I was hoping it to be very trivial, but  struggling to figure what changes I should do in my edmx file (did I tell u i am using entity framework version 5.0).  I just want to use a fucntion to generate the key in necessary format for each iteration and insert it into my database.</p>
