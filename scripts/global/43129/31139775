<p>I'm using EF with WEB API.  I have a PUT Method which updates a entity which already is in the db.  Right now I have this:</p>  <pre><code>        // PUT api/fleet/5         public void Put(Fleet fleet)         {             Fleet dbFleet = db.Fleets.Find(fleet.FleetId);             dbFleet.Name = fleet.Name;             dbFleet.xy= fleet.xy;             //and so on....             db.SaveChanges();         } </code></pre>  <p>But I'm lazy and would just like to write something like:</p>  <pre><code>dbFleet.update(fleet); </code></pre>  <p>So I don't have to update every property by its own. </p>  <p>I'm sure there is a way but I could only find answers on how to do this with MVC but not when using a WEB API and not receiving the model state.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
