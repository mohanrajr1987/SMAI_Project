<p>In order to dramatically improve build times on developer machines and the build server, I'm considering setting the EF 4.5 entity model's "Validate on Build" property to "False".</p>  <p>What are the risks of this approach?</p>  <p>For purposes of this question:</p>  <ul> <li>The development team has server-based build process </li> <li>Development is active on multiple branches and changes are merged to a common branch for release</li> <li>Any developer merging to/from a branch would be expected to open the EDMX before check-in so VS will validate the merged model</li> </ul>
