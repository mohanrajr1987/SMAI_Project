<p>A team of developers have been working on the same solution for a while. One of developers has created a new project where he added the latest EF. I got latest code from TFS and tried building the solution. while I wasn't getting errors for the new project I am getting the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Could not load type 'System.Data.Entity.Design.AspNet.EntityDesignerBuildProvider'. C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config 133 </code></pre>  <p>My target's version is 4.0. However when I checked C:\Windows\assembly my EF assemblies are of version 3.5. Is that what causes my problem?</p>
