<p>I have the following Linq statement: </p>  <pre><code>car car = db.cars               .Include("wheels")               .Include("windows")               .Where(c =&gt; c.id == id)               .FirstOrDefault(); </code></pre>  <p>I have lazy loading turned off. I want to return a single car with several wheels and several windows, but this returns a one wheeled car with just one window. How can I return all the children in this query, whilst still returning just one car? </p>  <p>I should also note that this is a many-to-many relationship, so a wheel can be assigned to many cars.</p>
