<p>I'm pretty sure I'm not using the correct terminology, but here I go.</p>  <p>I have an Entity Framework based application that I need to produce some kind of reporting for. What I've built is essentially a form-filling site, for which the forms are user-defined. The model looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>Form -&gt; Questions Submission -&gt; Questions, Form(ID) </code></pre>  <p>I wish to collapse the 3nF models into flat data for processing, essentially for an eventual export into a file that contains one submission per row, one question per column (and the submission object's key).</p>  <p>I'm thinking that this might be accomplished via enumeration somehow, but I'm a little lost in how to implement it.</p>  <p>Thanks to the entity framework, if I obtain a Submission object, the Questions are an (enumerable) property of it, but I don't know how to translate that to column data without some old-school string building.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>
