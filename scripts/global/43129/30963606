<p>How to force <strong>VS 2013</strong> to generate <code>LegacyObjectContext</code> classes during <strong>Update Model from database</strong>. Because after changing the database and updating model from database I get <strong>T4</strong> classes, and I can not make the project even compile correctly, I've searched a lot about this in google but have not found nothing about it. I've came accross with this solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19923156/how-to-use-entity-framework-4-with-visual-studio-2013">How to Use Entity Framework 4 with Visual Studio 2013</a> but it doesn't work for me. I were trying to do it in the following way: <strong>update model from database</strong> using standart <strong>VS wizard</strong>, and after that I had changed the <code>GodeGenerationStrategyProperty</code> to <code>LegacyObjectContext</code> and after that to delet all files from solution that were not there before I used next <code>git clean -fd</code>. But I couldn't build the project after this. How can I fix it ?</p>
