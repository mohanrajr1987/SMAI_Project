<p>How can we define multiple where clause in a single lamda expression. What I need , if lamda expression finds result with matching criteria then it filters out only those records otherwise it will return all records. I want to get this in a single lamda expression. As I have multiple criteria on which I have to filter records from database using lamda expression. </p>  <p>I don't want to use if else conditions and then change my lamda expression accordingly. I want to achieve this in a single expression.</p>  <pre><code>var objList = from o in db.sometable                               join p in db.sometable1 on o.sometable1Id equals p.Id                               join q in db.sometable2 on p.Id equals q.Id                               join r in db.sometable3 on p.Id equals r.Id                               join s in db.sometable4 on o.id equals s.Id                               where r.1stcriteria == X || r.2ndCriteria == Y || r.3rdCriteria == Z                               select new                               {                                   o.Id,                                   r.X,                                   r.Y,                                   s.Name,                                   o.area_sold,                                   p.stock                                }; </code></pre>  <p>On above expression i need to get result even if no criteria match or any one of them matched.Or even two of them matched.</p>  <p>Please if anyone help me out.</p>
