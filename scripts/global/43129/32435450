<p>I have been looking for a stored procedure that generates the dynamic sql below, which when I ran I found that it was missing extra quotation marks, otherwise it did not work.</p>  <p>I had to use the sql profiler to find this problematic sql code, which breaks the process of generating a report using the entity framework 4.</p>  <pre><code>exec sp_executesql N'SELECT TOP (1)  [Extent1].[InstanceId] AS [InstanceId],  [Extent1].[AssociationId] AS [AssociationId],  [Extent1].[Level] AS [Level],  [Extent1].[Values] AS [Values] FROM [dbo].[Report] AS [Extent1] WHERE [Extent1].[InstanceId] = @p__linq__0',N'@p__linq__0 uniqueidentifier',@p__linq__0='0C550367-AFGH-425A-B7FA-559ED41EBBC2' </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that I have no clue where to look for the stored procedure, though I am also not sure whether it may have been generated by something other than a stored proc.</p>
