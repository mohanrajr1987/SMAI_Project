<p>I'm doing Code First development with Visual Studio 2012. Since I'm in the early stages of the project I'm making a lot of schema and table changes and I've found that its a good step to periodically regenerate the table classes using the wizard in Visual Studio for 'Code First From Database' into a scratch project and copy over the generated code, since I will tend to miss adding a key field or collection or something when modifying the fields by hand. </p>  <p>Does Visual Studio use .tt files to do this, and if so how hard is it to set them up to use them outside of the wizard?</p>  <p>What I'm doing is working but using their templates would be nice.</p>  <p>thanks,</p>  <p>john</p>
