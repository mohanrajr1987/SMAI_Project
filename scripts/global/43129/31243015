<p>I have added </p>  <pre><code>modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove"&lt;"OneToManyCascadeDeleteConvention"&gt;"(); </code></pre>  <p>convention in my context file while I am trying to update the database using code-first. I was unable to update the database before because of the foreign key constraints, and now after adding this I am able to update. Needed to know, will this impact my already built services where when I delete a parent the child also gets deleted. I am very new to Entity Framework, please help me understand the impacts of this convention.</p>  <p>What should be my alternate to update-database if I shouldn't be using this convention?</p>
