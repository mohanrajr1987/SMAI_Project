<p>Well I am not sure if this questions asked before but I have no idea how the search for it. Well this is not an Entity Framework specified question but I am gonna give example using it.</p>  <p>So in EF we need to use <code>.Include("Related Object")</code> to include related data. However what I want to is that write a method that takes a List of strings and returns the entity or entity list with the related objects.</p>  <p>In example</p>  <pre><code>public List&lt;Entity&gt; GetAll(List&lt;string&gt; includes&gt;) {      List&lt;Entity&gt; entites = context.Entites;      foreach(string s in includes)      {           entites.Include(s);      }      return entites; } </code></pre>  <p>Obviously above example won't work since I already called out the Entites when I declared the list. But I think it demonstrates the point. </p>
