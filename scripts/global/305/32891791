<p>I'm developing a small menu in python where at some point the user is being asked for a float number.</p>  <p>The user could pass:</p>  <pre><code>1.23 1 //it's valid... 23.34e-10 //scientific notation </code></pre>  <p>The user is asked for inserting a float value, if the value is not a float (for example the user could write a generic string...) the program doesn't have to crash but just to re-iterate until the user pass a valid float value. So actually the structure is</p>  <pre><code>var = ""; while(var is not a float):    var = raw_input(""); </code></pre>  <p>Does exists a fast way to do that? or should use somehow a regular expression?</p>
