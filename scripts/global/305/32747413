<p>I have a problem with a PLC (Programmable Logical Controller) which does not handle denormalized floating points.</p>  <p>Here's a few hex representations of the numbers (denormalized) I am receiving from the controller on the oposite side of my PLC: 0x00004180, 0x0000C180, 0x00006FA0</p>  <p>Would anybody be so kind to share a small code example (C++/C# or similar) on how to bitwise normalize a value similar to the above? I cannot use any float operations on the numbers since they are not recognized in the PLC, hence HEX/BIN operations only.</p>  <p>Precision is not a problem.</p>
