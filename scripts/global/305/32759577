<p>My first question here ;) I am stuck with trying to set a value on a device with SNMP protocol by using SNMP++ library (<a href="http://www.agentpp.com/doc/snmp++3.x/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.agentpp.com/doc/snmp++3.x/index.html</a>). When I check the value with visual MIB browser, it is shown as Opaque (on device it is, in fact, a float). </p>  <p>So, the current value of the variable is 1.0 (which is represented as an Octed String as 9F 78 04 3F 80 00 00, no idea why first 4 hex-pairs are this way, but 3F 80 00 00 is exactly 1.0 in floatish). I have modified snmpSet console example a little bit, so now when I want to set the value, I do as follows:</p>  <p>(inside determine_vb(...) function)</p>  <pre><code>case sNMP_SYNTAX_OPAQUE: {   string str;   cout &lt;&lt; "Opaque\n";   cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter new value: ";   cin &gt;&gt; str;   // float value_float = atof(str.c_str());   const char * value_char = str.c_str();   vb.set_value(value_char);   return true; } </code></pre>  <p>(here you have full .cpp file) <a href="http://pastebin.com/8sLTyP8D" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/8sLTyP8D</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately, setting data for vb this way does not seem to work, since setting a parameter gives me following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Set Status = SNMP: Cannot create/set variable, Wrong Encoding</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does anyone of you have any idea how to properly encode a float for a SNMP query, so it will be accepted?</p>  <p>Best regards!
