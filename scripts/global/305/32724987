<p>I need to do some basic floating point math stuff (adding and multiplying money) for a website UI. I know that Javascript floats aren't accurate because of how they're stored, but I also know that somehow, it's possible to get the level of accuracy I require. I know this because Google's calculator can do it (type "calculator" into the Goog)..</p>  <p>Anyway, I don't want to have to send my little numbers back to the server and have to wait for a response, so I'm trying to use a library called <a href="http://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/" rel="nofollow">BigNumbers.js</a>, but I can't figure out how to make it spit out numbers (or strings) no matter what I call, it returns a BigNumber object.</p>  <p>Here's my test code: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/w715yq1f/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a></p>  <pre><code>floats = [145, 1.44, 1.3];  sum = new BigNumber(0);  for(i=0; i&lt;floats.length; i++){     sum = sum.times(floats[i]); }  // sum = sum.toDigits(); //returns object // sum = sum.toString(); //returns 0  console.log(sum); // expecting 271.44, getting object </code></pre>  <p>How can I achieve the expected result? If there's a better library to use, that would be an acceptable answer as well.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
