<p>I want to read a binary data file that contains 32 bit floating point binary data in python. I tried using hexdump on the file and then reading the hexdump in python. Some of the values when converted back to float returned nan. I checked if I made a mistake in combining the hexdump values but couldn't find any. This is what  I did this in shell: </p>  <p>hexdump -vc >> output.txt</p>  <p>The output was of the form  c0 05 e5 3f ... and so on </p>  <p>I joined the hex as : '3fe505c0'</p>  <p>Is this the correct way to do this ? </p>
