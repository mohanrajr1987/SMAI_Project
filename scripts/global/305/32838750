<p>I have a problem to format numbers in this manner:</p>  <pre><code>Original number: 8.400 Needed number: 8.40 I can use: number_format(floatval($number), 2)  Original number: 1.500 Needed number: 1.50 I can use again: number_format(floatval($number), 2)  Original number: 3.546 Needed number: 3.546 I can use again: Here i dont know what should i use. I need that 3rd decimal  Original number: 10 Needed number: 10.00 I can use again: number_format(floatval($number), 2) </code></pre>  <p>So if number contain 3rd decimal places, and 3rd is <code>0</code>, then i need it trimmed (can use for example <code>floatval</code>), but if 3rd decimal place is different than zero then i should leave that number intact.</p>
