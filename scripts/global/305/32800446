<p>I've checked out the docs for this on docs.racket-lang.org, and looked all over the internet for a possible implementation of this, but all I'm looking for is a random number generating function that generates a number between 0 and 1. For instance, in Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; Math.random() 0.16275149723514915 </code></pre>  <p>I'm looking for this in Racket, and I'd implement it if I could, but I just don't have the chops (yet).</p>
