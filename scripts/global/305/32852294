<p>I'm trying to write a C program to find the smallest positive integer x so that (1/x) * x is not equal to 1, using single precision. And I do it again with double precision. I know that the x for single precision is 41, however when I test it by writing C code, I still get 1.00000</p>  <p>This is my test code</p>  <pre><code>int main() {     float x = 41;     float div = 1/x;     float test = div * x;      printf("%f\n", test); } </code></pre>  <p>I get 1.0000 instead of a 0.999999</p>
