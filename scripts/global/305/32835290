<p>I am doing one program that calculates your BMI(body mass index),everything is working,but the result that appears,It's not right,because appears one number giant,like 24,99999 and I want that only appears something like 24,99.</p>  <p>My code is that :</p>  <pre><code>  height = Double.parseDouble(txtHeight.getText());                     weight =     Double.parseDouble(txtWeight.getText());                                bmi = height/weight;                     bmi = weight/3.24;                                     if(bmi &lt; 17) {                         lblBMI.setText("Your BMI is : " +bmi  + "," + " very underweight");                     } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Example : If I put Height like 1,80 and Weight like 45 It will appears in the result as Your BMI is 13,88888888888888888.</strong></p>  <p><strong>PS : All the variables are Double.</strong></p>
