<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> by Bruce Dawson on how to compare floating point values. But all of his examples were checking if </p>  <pre><code>  floatA == floatB.  </code></pre>  <p>So I was wondering if there is a proper way to compare if either </p>  <pre><code>  floatA &gt; floatB  </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>  floatA &lt;floatB. </code></pre>  <p>Or is the &lt; , > operator enough to consider the floating point values?</p>  <p>Edit: I'm not interesed in how to check for equals. I'm interested if there is a way to do checks for if one float value is smaller / greater than the other.</p>
