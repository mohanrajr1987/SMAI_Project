<p>Currently working on an assignment and a bit stuck. We are to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The final answer should output a floating point number if the answer is a decimal, or a integer if it's a whole number. I have it set up to give me the floating point number, but when I enter a number, say '98.6', I'll get 37.00000 rather than 37. Been at it for a few hours trying to combat it on my own but I've run out of ideas. Thanks for the assistance!</p>  <pre><code>int main(void) {     float ftemp;     float ctemp;              printf ("Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: ");     scanf ("%f", &amp;ftemp);     ctemp = (100.0 / 180.0) * (ftemp - 32);     printf ("In Celsius, your temperature is %f!\n", ctemp);      return 0; } </code></pre>
