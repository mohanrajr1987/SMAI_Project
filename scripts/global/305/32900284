<p>I was asked this questino on a programming test. The question was, I was passed in a float as a parameter, and asked when would the following code be false.</p>  <pre><code>bool result  = (floatValue == floatValue); </code></pre>  <p>I couldn't think of a valid reason or a situation of when this would be false and still can't. In the end, I answered that there will never be a case when this would be false. Was wondering if anyone can give me some example(s) of when this would be false</p>
