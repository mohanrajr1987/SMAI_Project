<p>I wonder if someone can help me. I've been handed in a Cake PHP app that I need to 1) add minor changes 2) deploy. I've never really worked with Cake before and was wondering whether do I need to anything in order for it to work? </p>  <p>For instance, With a Node app, you need to install modules <code>npm install</code>. With a Rails app you'll likely need to install the gems <code>bundle install</code>.</p>  <p>Is there something similar with Cake? I've set the localhost server, but when I try to access the url I get all sort of errors. Some I've fixed (missing environment settings which I just override the Redis host and port). The latest one is:</p>  <pre><code>{   "exception":{     "class":"MissingControllerException",     "code":404,     "message":"Controller class Controller could not be found.",     "file":"\/Library\/WebServer\/Documents\/php\/oompbe\/vendors\/cakephp\/lib\/Cake\/Routing\/Dispatcher.php",     "line":154,     "trace":[       "#0 \.../app\/webroot\/index.php(109): Dispatcher-&gt;dispatch(Object(CakeRequest), Object(CakeResponse))",       "#1 {main}"     ]   } }  </code></pre>  <p>PS: What's up with all the crazy <code>\/\/</code>? PPS: Can I find out the version Cake I'm running?</p>
