<p>The manual says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Likewise, <code>binary</code> columns will accept file handles, and generate file handles when reading data.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm seeing it do this.  I have a table <code>users</code> with a column <code>my_blob</code>.  I did the bake all, so now I have a Table Users with an Entity User. If I get <code>$user</code> then <code>$user-&gt;my_blob</code> is a file handle (or stream) resource, not a string or something I can access directly. Reading the data may be easy enough <code>fread($user-&gt;my_blob, 256)</code>. But writing to it would be extremely cumbersome. I think I'd have to create a file to store my data then write to that or something like that.  </p>  <p>How do I write to a BLOB field?</p>
