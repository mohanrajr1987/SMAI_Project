<p>I am using cakephp 2.6.9. I have a table named: chat_info and model file: ChatInfo.php and class inside ChatInfo:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;?php /** *  */ class ChatInfo extends AppModel {     var $name = "chatinfo";  }  ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but it shows an error. I searched for this error and found that this is due to naming convention violation in cakecaphp. But whats wrong am I doing here   </p>
