<p>In my main layout we got this</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="myContent"&gt;     &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;fetch('content'); ?&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>to render the different views on my app. Also, at <code>/View/Pages/</code> I have static pages like 'About us', 'Contact', etc.</p>  <p>I would like to know if there is any way to insert the static pages in this place when I do click on the appropriate links.</p>  <p>I think it could be done with JQuery, but the question is if there is any magic in cakePHP to do it. Thanks.</p>
