<p>I'm currently stuck implementing image upload using CakePHP 1.3. </p>  <p>I am using the <a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com/#server-side-implementation" rel="nofollow">dropzonejs</a> library to handle upload and post request for the server, the documentation for this library states the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Server side implementation</strong></p>      <p>Dropzone does not provide the server side implementation of handling the files, but the way files are uploaded is identical to simple file upload forms like this:</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>&lt;form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt; &lt;input type="file" name="file" /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I found some image upload code which looks like it would work, however <strong>I don't know how I can retrieve the post request using CakePHP 1.3.</strong></p>  <p><strong>Information about my setup</strong></p>  <p>The image upload is located on the view: <code>banners\admin_index.ctp</code> The website URL for this location is: <code>site.com/admin/banners/</code></p>  <p>I have a controller called <code>banners_controller.ctp</code> which has the following functions: </p>  <ul> <li><code>admin_index()</code>   -- Which renders the view</li> <li><code>add()</code> -- This uses <code>$this-&gt;data</code> to save the files using <code>uploadFile()</code></li> <li><code>uploadFile()</code> -- This uploads the file onto the server</li> </ul>  <p>Currently the <code>add()</code> and <code>uploadFile()</code> functions are not being used. I need to figure out how to handle the post request and direct it to these functions.</p>  <p>A full version of my code can be located <a href="http://pastebin.com/3ZwZ2VXJ" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>  <p>In my view, I am creating the forms which dropzone.js links to like so:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form action="add" class="dropzone" id="adropzone"&gt;&lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When the form action is set to <code>add</code>, it gives the response 'Server responded with 0 code.', when I look in the Chrome network tab, there is a request to 'admin/banners/add' and says <code>(failed) net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT</code>. When I visit this page manually, I get a redirect loop: <code>ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS</code>.</p>  <p>I am not very familiar with CakePHP 1.3 at all, however I am required to add this to the site, any help or links to external resources would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
