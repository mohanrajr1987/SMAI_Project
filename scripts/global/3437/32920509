<p>I can do the <code>admin_edit</code>, <code>admin_delete</code>, <code>admin_print</code> and <code>admin_manage_tags</code> actions on an <code>ArticlesController</code>, those actions will require an <code>$id</code> passed. I can also do <code>admin_create</code> or <code>admin_sort</code> without an <code>$id</code>. Finally, <code>admin_delete</code> will require <code>POST</code>, all others should use <code>GET</code>. </p>  <p>How and where do I store all those rules in CakePHP in a way so I can easily access or update them all and have the corresponding action links renderd on the items list page, the edit page, or anywhere else automatically? </p>  <p>For example, I have a list page of all articles (<code>admin_index</code>), and would like to render the direct links to the editing or printing pages. I know I can hardcode them, but if I add some new functionality, such as <code>admin_render_pdf</code>, I'd have to go through all views and put it there manually. Same if I rename or remove an action.</p>  <p>Furthermore, having a common source of all admin actions could even allow me to render the admin navigation automatically.</p>  <p>Do I define an array somewhere manually, or does CakePHP have some magic that'd retrieve those for me? What is the commonly used / best practice in this case?</p>  <p>The closest I could find was this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25892594/list-all-controllers-actions-in-cakephp-3">list-all-controllers-actions-in-cakephp-3</a> but it looks like it's mostly ACL-related.</p>
