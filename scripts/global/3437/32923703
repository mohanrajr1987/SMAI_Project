<p>I would like to join two controllers. I have a controller Articles with a view function :</p>  <pre><code>public function view($id = null)     {        $article = $this-&gt;Articles-&gt;get($id, [             'contain' =&gt; []         ]);         $this-&gt;set('article', $article);         $this-&gt;set('_serialize', ['article']);     } </code></pre>  <p>Each article has an associated user. So I have a controller Users. Now I can have the user_id for the article (in database).  Is it possible to access the username in the User table with the user_id in the Articles table? With a get() function.</p>  <p>For example I know how to do it with find() :</p>  <pre><code>$this-&gt;set('articles', $this-&gt;Articles-&gt;find('all')-&gt;contain(['Users'])); </code></pre>  <p>But is it possible with get()? For a particular article.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
