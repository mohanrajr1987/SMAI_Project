<p>I have been unable to get logging to work in Authorization and Model classes, both of which say it can't find the logger.  In a controller, or a component, I don't need to add a 'use' line to get the logger working.  I've resorted to using pr(); die();  to see output from these classes while I make changes to a code base I didn't originally write.</p>  <p>I would prefer to do TDD instead of relying on output and page refreshes to see what I'm doing, but I don't see any documentation on how to write a unit test for Authorization classes.</p>  <p>1)  Are there any examples of how to add logging to model and authorization classes?</p>  <p>2)  Are there any examples of how to write a unit test for an authorization class?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
