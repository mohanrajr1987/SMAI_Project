<p>I have two tables in a database, one as event(eventID,name,location), and the other one as eventImages(id,eventID,path).</p>  <p>I need to get the images related to each event</p>  <p>I have tried the following statement in CakePHP:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php    App::uses('AppModel','Model');    class EventImages extends AppModel {       public $belongsTo = array('Event' =&gt; array('className' =&gt; 'Event','foreignKey' =&gt; 'eventID'));  } </code></pre>  <p>but no data is retrieved in the controller any missing statement?</p>
