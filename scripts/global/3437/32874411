<p>I have weird problems with my CakePHP3 app. On localhost everything works fine, but after copying it to server and entering main URL (without any calls on controllers) site says "requested address "The requested address '/' was not found on this server."</p>  <p>Moreover this is only when i enter url without www in it. When i add www inside url i have this error</p>  <p>"The requested address '/webroot/' was not found on this server."</p>  <p>.htaccess from main dir</p>  <pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt; RewriteEngine on RewriteRule    ^$    webroot/    [L] RewriteRule    (.*) webroot/$1    [L] </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>and from webroot</p>  <pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;     RewriteEngine On     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f     RewriteRule ^ index.php [L] &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help in advance! :)</p>
