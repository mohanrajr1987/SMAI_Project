<p>I am trying to do a two way databinding on android application. I have set up the application to bind the data to the UI but don't know how i can update the data model when edittext text changed.</p>  <p>I think of creating extended edittext which override the focus and textchanged so it can detect the text changed and focus for validation. But how can I know which data object am I dealing with.</p>  <p>I tried using app:addtextchangelistener by passing the function which return a textwatcher in the layout.xml but I received nullpointerexception.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to do Two-way databinding on android? </p>
