<p>I am using <code>requestimageforasset</code> to load assets, just as described in the Apple Dev Documentation.</p>  <p>It works and all, but I find it very very VERY slow when it comes to very large assets, such as videos of several hundreds of megabytes.</p>  <p>My goal is to load an asset, copy a chunk of its data, and send that chunk to a server.</p>  <p>I load chunks because of obvious reasons, RAM limitation.</p>  <p>I have a couple of questions in mind about this:</p>  <ol> <li><p>How can I copy chunks of large video assets really fast?</p></li> <li><p>Can I get any direct and fast access to asset data without calling <code>requestimageforasset</code>?</p></li> <li><p>Should I maintain the <code>requestimageforasset</code> open until I send the data and then leave it's completion block?</p></li> </ol>  <p>So, what approach should I take and where can I find info about this?</p>
