<p>I'm designing a program that selects random key-pairs as long as they are below a certain threshold.</p>  <p>So lets say I have these as my key-pairs:</p>  <pre><code>Padded=1 Leather=2 Studded Leather=3 Hide=4 Scale Mail=5 </code></pre>  <p>Ideally I would only be able to select combinations of one or more key-pairs that add up to be below a certain number, then print the text of the chosen ones to the screen.</p>  <p>What would be the best way to store the key-pairs that is easily editable and somewhat efficient, as well as can be randomly selected from. I will probably end up with 200+ key-pairs.</p>
