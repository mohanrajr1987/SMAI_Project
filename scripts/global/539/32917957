<p>I'm writing an article for a well known tech publication on developers who don't love coding/programming or have fallen out of love with doing that and seek alternate non coding careers or non coding careers in tech.  The fact is not everyone stays a developer forever.  Some do but most at some point become disenfranchised and choose something else to do.  Problem is, I cannot find reliable or objective data to support and I need the following:</p>  <p>1) Data on the percentage of unsatisfied/disenfranchised developers preferably taken from a large sample pool and recent. 2) Data on percentage of those dissatisfied with coding, what alternate jobs such as BA, QA, PM, did they wind up in?</p>  <p>I need sources, references to back all of it up as well.</p>
