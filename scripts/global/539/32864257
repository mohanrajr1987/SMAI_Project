<p>I am feeding highstock chart with datas from mysql. There are variables stored every minute so if you want to look at data past 3 months they are grouped. Highstock's default approximation functions give low,high,averare,sum values only. I min and max values are most important for me so I made my own approximation function which is:</p>  <pre><code>         approximation: function (arr) {                  // first time or point precalculated                           if ( !gInfo || gInfo.nextPoint) {                     // first time return first value (arr[0])                     var point = gInfo ? gInfo.nextPoint : arr[0];                     // save current data to the next iteration                         gInfo = {prev : arr, nextPoint : null};                     return point;                 } else {                     var prev = gInfo.prev,                         // concat current group with the previous one                         data = prev.concat(arr),                         // get min, max and their positions                                 min = Math.min.apply(null, data),                         max = Math.max.apply(null, data),                         minIdx = data.indexOf(min),                         maxIdx = data.indexOf(max),                         // order min and max                         aprox = minIdx &lt; maxIdx ? [min, max] : [max, min];                     // save next aproximation and return current                     gInfo.nextPoint = aprox[1];                     return aprox[0];                 }         }, </code></pre>  <p>Actually I didn't make it but I found it here in the forum.</p>  <p>The problem is it gives me right results only at some ranges as shown in the pictures below:</p>  <p>First picture at max range - not ok:  <a href="http://postimg.org/image/u9l2vesjr/full/" rel="nofollow">Max range - you can't see every min value</a></p>  <p>As I am changing range to smaller I can see every min value: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/5afdiqng5/full/" rel="nofollow">This is how it should looke like at max range</a></p>  <p>It is also happening when I zoom in so datas are grouped in two min intervals and I am just scrolling to the left or to the right. </p>  <p>At first I thought that it has something to do with the way groups are made by changing <code>groupPixelWidth:</code> to any value did not help.</p>  <p>Having min or max is really important for me and this is something I can solve in highstock. </p>  <p>Thx for your help</p>
