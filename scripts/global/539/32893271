<p>I was recently given a task by my manager (its not a HW problem...). We have a hierarchical data structure like below:</p>  <p><strong>Continent</strong>: Europe; North America. <strong>Country</strong>: Germany, France, Italy(under Europe); USA, Canada(under North America). <strong>State</strong>: Florida(Under USA) <strong>County</strong>: Broward, Monroe(Under Florida) <strong>City</strong>: Cooper City, Fort Lauderdale(Under Broward)</p>  <p><strong><em>Q.1.</em></strong> Please create a data model that represent this structure. <strong><em>Q.2.</em></strong> Please create a function that, given a parent (Continent, Country, State or County) return a comma separated list of cities under that parent. Note: The data model should be scalable: you should be able to add more nodes, leaves or levels in the future without changing the object model. No UI or database needed. A console application would be fine. I did it using a C++ map> but it was not accepted, any suggestions would be appreciated. If c++ or c# code can be provided that would be awesome.</p>
