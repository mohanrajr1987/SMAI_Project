<p>I have a spreadsheet with data relating to meetings . One of the cells has the name of meetings with the amount of participants under brackets as follows. </p>  <p>Staff meeting (65), HR meeting (15), Pension meeting (4)</p>  <p>There can be in between 1 to 9 meetings in a single cell. I am looking for a way to extract each meeting name and number (all information between commas) in separate cells. </p>  <p>Does anyone know how can this be done?</p>
