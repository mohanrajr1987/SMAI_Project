<p>Ok, so I want to make an ios app that displays Islamic books from <a href="http://al-islam.org" rel="nofollow">this website</a>. The structure of the books are based on RDFa. How do I get all the data (the entire book) in html format, and store it in database with the information I need? </p>  <p>Here is an <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/return-al-mahdi-al-fadl-ibn-shadhan" rel="nofollow">example</a> of a book from that website. They have <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/print/book/export/html/39965" rel="nofollow">html version</a> of every books as well. When I click on "view source" from my chrome browser, it gives a lot of hints. </p>
