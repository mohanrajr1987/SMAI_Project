<p>Assuming I have the following text:</p>  <pre><code>today was a good day and today was a sunny day.  </code></pre>  <p>I break up this text into lines, seperated by white spaces, which is</p>  <pre><code>Today  was  a  good </code></pre>  <p>etc.</p>  <p>Now I use the vector data structure to simple count the number of words in a text via .size(). That's done.</p>  <p>However, I also want to check If a word comes up more than once, and if so, how many time. In my example "today" comes up 2 times.</p>  <p>I want to store that "today" and append a 2/x (depending how often it comes up in a large text). Now that's not just for "today" but for every word in the text. I want to look up how often a word appears, append an counter, and sort it (the word + counters) in descending order (that's another thing, but not important right now).</p>  <p>I'm not sure which data structure to use here. Map perhaps? But I can't add counters to map.</p>  <p>Edit: This is what I've done so far: <a href="http://pastebin.com/JncR4kw9" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/JncR4kw9</a></p>
