<p>In my code, I'm calling a c file method from a c++ file.</p>  <p>From C++ file, I'm passing a structure pointer. In the structure, there's an integer element.</p>  <p>The C function populates 0 in the structure's integer element. If I print it there, it prints 0 correctly. </p>  <p>However if I try to print the same from C++ file, it prints 1677215 i.e 0xFFFFFF.</p>  <p>Can you please help?</p>
