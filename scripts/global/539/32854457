<p>I seem to have a problem extracting data from 2 tables because of the data type.</p>  <p>Table <strong>Card</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>A         B ========  ====== 10000000  1 20000000  2 34567890  3 43153700 </code></pre>  <p>Table <strong>Merchant</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>B         C ========  ====== 1         23456 2         34567 3         67890 </code></pre>  <p><code>Merchant.B</code> is a FK on <code>Card.B</code>.</p>  <p>I want to find the result of the rows in Column A in the Card table where Column A like 12% and 4315% and the corresponding Column C values from Table Merchant. I can do a straight join to get this data but I have only the 6 digits from Column A in the Card table so can't use a wildcard in an IN clause as it is an int.  My sql was something like this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT CONVERT(varchar(10), a.ColumnA),a.Column B,a.Column C   FROM Card a       ,Merchant b   WHERE a.Column C = b.Column C     AND a.Column A IN (100000%,345678%)      </code></pre>  <p>How do I go about finding rows in Column A knowing that I have only the first 6 digits and not the entire string?</p>
