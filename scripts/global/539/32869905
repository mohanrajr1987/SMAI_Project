<p>So I am trying to code with AngularJS the best practice way without using $scope or $rootScope, but named controllers.</p>  <p><a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LpxOwx" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LpxOwx</a></p>  <p>Here's the Angular part:</p>  <pre><code>.controller('demoController', function(Fac){   var vm = this;   vm.theme = Fac.theme;   vm.changeTheme = function(theme) {     Fac.changeTheme(theme);     vm.theme = Fac.theme;   };  })  .controller('secondController', function(Fac){   var vm = this;   vm.changeTheme = function(theme) {     Fac.changeTheme(theme);   };  })   .factory('Fac', function() {   var fac = {   theme: '',   changeTheme: function(theme) {     fac.theme = theme === 'indigo' ? 'lime' : 'indigo';    } } return fac; }); </code></pre>  <p>I have forked a codepen to illustrate my problem. The demoController works as intended and updates the view. But it doesn't "work" when using the same Factory in the secondController. I assume that it works, but just doesn't update in the demoController.</p>  <p>The way i understood Angular data binding is, that all I need to do is use the Factory to share data between Controllers which bind to them and update accordingly on change.</p>  <p>I am sure, it's a very stupid mistake I'm doing here. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>Best regards and thanks!</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>  <p>Thanks for the answers! I've encountered a new (related?) problem though:</p>  <p><a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/cRa2FTkpbIsJ9TLzu5bD?p=preview" rel="nofollow">http://plnkr.co/edit/cRa2FTkpbIsJ9TLzu5bD?p=preview</a></p>  <p>Can you tell me how I bind the user between LoginCtrl and ToolbarCtrl so that ng-show and ng-hide can update upon login and logout? When I login the Toolbar doesn't update accordingly. I have to refresh the whole page instead to make the login visible. When i logout it works because i explicitly set vm.user= {}; in the ToobarCtrl. </p>
