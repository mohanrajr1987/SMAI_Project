<p>I'm creating a program in which I need to store an item name, and a value. The program will randomly choose things from the list based on the total value being lower then a set limit, and then printing the names of those items. What would be the best file to store this in? I was looking at an .ini file, but that seems to be for settings and such. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
