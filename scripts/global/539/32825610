<p>G'day all,</p>  <p>I've come unstuck when trying to fetch a single record using Ember Data 2.</p>  <p>The server is designed to respond to a GET request  like this:</p>  <p><code>GET http://server/api/results/1</code></p>  <p>with this as a result:</p>  <pre><code>{    "results" : [      {         "id": 1,         "catname": "Category 1",      }    ] } </code></pre>  <p>The Ember route code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>export default Ember.Route.extend({    model: function() {         return this.store.find('game',12);    } }); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that there doesn't appear to be a network request going out (a previous findAll fetch has worked, so I don't think it's the adapter), and there is an error I have not been able to find informaiton on:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property'crossDomain' of undefined</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does anyone have any idea what this could be, of hint at how I might track this down?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Andy</p>
