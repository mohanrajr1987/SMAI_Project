<p>My code is </p>  <pre><code>$data = "met with a good salesperson in sunway carnival. her name is Katie Hopkins, manager of Marketing &amp; Sales. Her mobile phone is 0165531477. And then, met with Katie Holmes, her mobile phone is 0123456777.";  echo preg_match('\h*(\d+)',$data);     </code></pre>  <p>I want to retrieve the particular information from the string, <code>$data</code> and then assign the people name into array $name[] and also their mobile phones into array <code>$mobile[]</code>. Below is the example, but I don't know how to do php coding to get the people name and their mobile phone numbers into the particular array.</p>  <pre><code>$name[0] = 'Kean Teck'; $mobile[0] = '0165531477';  $name[1] = 'Katie Hopkins'; $mobile[1] = '0123456777'; </code></pre>
