<p>From time to time, I find myself spending quite a bit of time diagnosing and troubleshooting false positives that come from my automated tests.  Out of a few hundred tests driven in a browser, around 4% of them fail with seemingly no rhyme or reason, and they tend to be different each and every time.  For example, some simple shared steps may work in one example but then fail for no reason in another.</p>  <p>I've continued to spend time troubleshooting and improving these areas (improving waiting on elements, improved preconditions, etc) but it seems to only help marginally.  Anecdotally, this phenomenon seems to worsen when using IE11 vs Chrome.</p>  <p>I've come across a neat gem called <code>rspec-retry</code> which simply retries any failed tests as they come along.  I'm wondering what the consensus is with this approach, as I'm adamant of making sure that I'm "testing the right way".</p>
