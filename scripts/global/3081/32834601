<p>I've got code like</p>  <pre><code>it 'transfers the account balance to the recipient' do   expect(&amp;transaction_creator.method(:call)).to change(account, :balance_cents).by(54_321_01) end </code></pre>  <p>which works, but it feels wrong. I was under the impression that something that responds to <code>call</code> ought to be able to act like a proc or a lambda, because of Ruby's duck-typing. However, if I do <code>expect(&amp;transaction_creator)</code> I get</p>  <pre><code>wrong argument type TransactionCreator (expected Proc) </code></pre>  <p>and if I do <code>expect(transaction_creator)</code>, I get</p>  <pre><code>expected #balance_cents to have changed by 5432101, but was not given a block </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way of simplifying <code>&amp;transaction_creator.method(:call)</code>?</p>
