<p>I recently set up my website to use https. I need to make sure that none of my pages reference http links (or else google gives a warning telling visitors that some assets are not secure). What is the most comprehensive way to test for the absence of these references (in both the head and body of each page) using capybara/rspec/selenium?</p>  <p>I've gotten as far as this to check for the head but don't know where to go from here or if this is the best way to do this:</p>  <pre><code>    [15] pry(#&lt;RSpec::ExampleGroups::Template&gt;)&gt; page.all('head', visible: false).first     =&gt; #&lt;Capybara::Node::Element tag="head" path="/html/head"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thank you for any help</p>
