<p>Here is the code I have:</p>  <pre><code>def initialize (htaccess_file_content)    @htaccess_hash = Hash.new    htaccess_file_content.each_line do | line |       @commands = line.split       @htaccess_hash[@commands[0]] = @commands[1]    end end def auth_name   @htaccess_hash['AuthName'].gsub(/''/,"") end </code></pre>  <p>This is my spec:</p>  <pre><code>describe WebServer::Htaccess do   let(:auth_name) { "This is the auth_name" } end  describe '#auth_name' do   it 'returns the AuthName string' do     expect(htaccess_user.auth_name).to eq auth_name   end end </code></pre>  <p>My Ruby code is not returning the whole string and I don't know why. Here is the error message from the failed test:</p>  <pre><code> Failure/Error: expect(htaccess_user.auth_name).to eq auth_name     expected: "This is the auth_name"         got: "\"This"     (compared using ==) </code></pre>
