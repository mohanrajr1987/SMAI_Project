<p>The project I'm working on has a fairly large test suite. I am currently writing test that passes when I run it alone but when I run the entire test suite <code>$rspec</code> I get some really funky behavior that causes the test to fail.</p>  <p>Right now the test is nested like this:</p>  <pre><code>spec/folder1/folder2/folder3/test.rb </code></pre>  <p>Each of these commands run the test fine and everything passes:</p>  <pre><code>$rspec spec/folder1/folder2/folder3 $rspec spec/folder1/folder2 $rspec spec/folder1/ </code></pre>  <p>There are about 10 other folders at the same level as <code>folder1</code> that I would like to individually not run with the rest of the suite in order to determine which folder contains tests that are breaking the test I am working on.</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>
