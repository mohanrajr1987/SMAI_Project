<p>Using this gem <a href="https://github.com/estum/growlyflash" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/estum/growlyflash</a> I am attempting to write test cases for it using capybara and rspec.</p>  <p>I know that its an XHR, and that capybara usually waits for the page to load( or check again after a short period). </p>  <p>The notifications work, but I am not able to test them. Not really sure what to do. </p>  <p>Test case looks like this.  </p>  <p><code>expect(page).to have_content("A message has been sent!")</code></p>
