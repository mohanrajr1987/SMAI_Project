<p>I'm using the DevExpress grid, and it can be custom grouped by the user. From the image below, I would like to know, using the GridViewControl_FocusedRowChanged event, when a City row is selected.  In the sample, any Level 1 row.</p>  <p>But if the user changes the grouping to e.g. City -> Country, then I would like to do something when the Level 0 row is selected.</p>  <p>How can I know which Level grouping City is in?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bzwhn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bzwhn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>private void GridViewControl_FocusedRowChanged(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.FocusedRowChangedEventArgs e) {     bool isCityInFocus = ??;     if (isCityInFocus)         //Do Something  } </code></pre>
