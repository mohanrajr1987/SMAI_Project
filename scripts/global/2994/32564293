<p>I need to edit gridcontrol cell. There are column with decimal value (default 0,0000). When I edit cell, there are requirement - allow to insert symbol "&lt;" and display like (0 000 000), without decimals.<br> I tried regular expressions to edit mask - no good result, reg exp + reformat data source column to string type - no good result, changed simple display format - no result too.<br> Is there are good method for this situation?</p>
