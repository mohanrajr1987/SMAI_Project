<p>I need the application idle time in my software. For that reason, I made a helper class <code>ApplicationIdleHelper</code> which implements the <code>IMessageFilter</code> interface.</p>  <p>This works fine and if my application is in idle for some time, I'm showing a <code>DevExpress WaitForm</code> using this line of code:</p>  <pre><code>SplashScreenManager.ShowForm(typeof(WaitForm)); </code></pre>  <p>In this <code>WaitForm</code> I show the user some information about what's being done in the background. If the user moves the mouse or presses some keys I close the WaitForm like this:</p>  <pre><code>SplashScreenManager.CloseForm(); </code></pre>  <p><strong>Here's the problem explained in steps:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Mouse cursor is on the form.</li> <li>User doesn't do anything for some time -> idle time -> so I show the <code>WaitForm</code>.</li> <li>Now I get a <code>MouseMove message</code> in my <code>PreFilterMessage</code> method? BUT WHY? Mouse didn't move. No keys pressed? Because I get a <code>MouseMove message</code> my application thinks, the user did some input and automatically closes the <code>WaitForm</code>.</li> </ol>  <p>Same behavior if I close the <code>WaitForm</code>.</p>  <p>Here's a sample application, so you should be able to reproduce the behavior: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxabrokJG-OWV3FLV2hNNVk5NjQ/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxabrokJG-OWV3FLV2hNNVk5NjQ/view?usp=sharing</a></p>  <p>The DevExpress documentation says: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Wait Forms and Splash Screens are displayed by a Splash Screen Manager   in a separate thread.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Maybe this has something to do with that behavior?</p>  <p>Hope somebody can explain me, why I geht a <code>MouseMove message</code> in my <code>PreFilterMessage</code> function, after showing or closing the <code>WaitForm</code>. </p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
