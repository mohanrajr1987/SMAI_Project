<p>I am developing a product application. It is windows form application using devexpress control. This application is a billing application. </p>  <p>My clients wants to design custom invoice format. If I add reports in my visual studio project then I have to deploy all reports to all clients. I want to deploy the report that is developed specific for the client.  To do this I want a way that I can save Xtrareport as a file or in database. So that I can load it on runtime dynamically. </p>  <p>Is there anyway to do this ?</p>  <p>Environment : C# 4.5 WinForms DevExpress 14.2.4.0</p>
