<p>I have a dev express grid set to :  </p>  <pre><code> &lt;Settings HorizontalScrollBarMode="Visible" ShowFooter="False" VerticalScrollBarMode="Auto" VerticalScrollableHeight="450" GridLines="Both" ShowStatusBar="Hidden" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but it will not scroll horizontally. I thought maybe bootstrap or jquery were stopping it but I removed all references to them and it still will not scroll.</p>
