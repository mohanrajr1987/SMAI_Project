<p>I am a newbie to Devexpress / XAF and have been stuck for a long time on how to view related objects, for winform.</p>  <p>For example, I've got a Business Object <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>. <code>A</code> is one to many to <code>B</code> and <code>B</code> is one to many to <code>C</code>. </p>  <p>I've created all relationships correctly and when I run and breakpoint it, all records related to <code>A</code> in <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> is in the <code>XPCollection</code> in my <code>A</code>.  (I created the classes and relationships as per <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Example/Details/E1448" rel="nofollow">How to show the grandchildren collection in the DetailView</a>)</p>  <p>In <code>Model.DesignedDiffs.xafml</code> for my <code>application.Module.Win</code>, in <code>BOModel</code> I can see <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are in <code>A</code>'s <code>OwnMembers</code>. In the Views, <code>A</code>'s <code>DetailView</code>, I've added a <code>LayoutViewItem</code> for <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. </p>  <p>And I added some columns to view the data, I added <code>B</code> as <code>ModelClass</code> and in the columns I've added <code>C</code> as <code>PropertyName</code> and <code>Object.C_otherproperties</code> but it is not displaying anything. It only displays two empty rows.  (record consist of A to 2xB and 2xB to 4xC) </p>  <p>How to display the related objects in <code>listview</code> and <code>detailview</code>?</p>
