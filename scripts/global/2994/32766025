<p>I'm trying to accomplish <em>inline editing</em> with a DevExpress ASPxTreeList control on an ASP.NET 4.5 webforms application - something like this (taken from the DevExpress demo site):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KlMRb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KlMRb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What I'm trying to do are two things:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I'd like to be able to restrict my inline editing to just a few columns - e.g. <strong>only</strong> the <code>Budget</code> column should be editable. I'd like to have <strong>only</strong> the <code>Budget</code> cell turn into a textbox to allow data entry - while all other columns in the chosen row should remain <em>as is</em> - as labels basically (right now, when I enable inline editing, <em>all</em> cells turn into editable controls - they turn into a textbox that would suggest editing is possible)</p></li> <li><p>I would love to be able to just click (or double-click) into that cell to enable inline editing - for now, I need to use a separate command button to "turn on" editing. How can I do this (if at all)?</p></li> </ol>
