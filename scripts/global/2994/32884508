<p>I looked into a demo of date edit at <a href="https://demos.devexpress.com/MVCxDataEditorsDemos/Editors/DateEdit" rel="nofollow">https://demos.devexpress.com/MVCxDataEditorsDemos/Editors/DateEdit</a> for date and time functionality, in which date and time only selected when OK button is clicked and calendar disappears. I want to implement the same functionality without Time(Clock) in date edit calendar.  My main focus is to add OK button to Calendar, so it disappears only click of OK button.</p>
