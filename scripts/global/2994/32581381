<p>I have <code>GridControl</code> with <code>SearchPanel</code>, and I try to find some string in <code>TableView</code>.</p>  <p>When I set <code>SearchPanelHighlightResults</code> I received correctly result, same strings have been highlighted, but when I try filtering result by setting <code>SearchPanelAllowFilter</code>, all rows have been removed.</p>  <p>I solved this problem by changing type of source collection from <code>ListCollectionView</code> to <code>ObservableCollection</code></p>
