Now I want to make group of these BarButtonItems. </p>  <p>For example, clicking on the button shows popup menu or something like dialog which shows BarButtonItems with Glyphs.</p>  <p>How to achieve it? </p>  <p><a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument5406" rel="nofollow">This link</a> works for Ribbon Control but we are instructed to not use RibbonControl or RibbonManager. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uhmdp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uhmdp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
