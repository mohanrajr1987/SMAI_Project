<p>I have a DevExpress XtraChart LineChart control, and its argument is DateTime. I use the AxisX.DateTimeOptions.Format = DateTimeFormat.General, it will display year, month, day, hour, minute, but the labels will overlap each other. I know in DevExpress 15.1 version, we have new property to resolve this. But unfortunately I am on version 10.1 and I cannot upgrade for now. </p>  <p>I want to display the label as two lines: the first line just displays yyyy-MM-dd, and the second line just displays h:mm tt, how could I achieve this? How should I set the FormatString? Or shall I use the AxisX.DateTimeOptions.Format = DateTimeFormat.Custom or something else?</p>  <p>Thanks!!</p>
