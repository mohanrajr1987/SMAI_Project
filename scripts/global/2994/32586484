<p>I develop a C# WPF application using DevExpress controls. I have a DXRibbonWindow as mainwindow which includes several complex usercontrols.</p>  <p>My problem is that the InitializeComponent() method of the mainwindow takes up to 9 seconds to finish. So the application startup takes too long for our customers.</p>  <p>I already tried to initialize each single usercontrol not until it is shown on screen. This way reduce the time of InitializeComponent() heavily about 7 seconds, but in code behind i sometimes need to get access to the controls. Therefore the application throw NullReference exceptions.</p>  <p>Is there any other effective way to improve the initialization of my application?</p>
