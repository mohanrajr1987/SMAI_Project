<p>I want to know if there is a way to make the <code>RichEditControl</code> as a <code>MemoEdit</code> or just like a <code>TextEdit</code>.</p>  <p>I will leave a picture to let you know what I need, all I can do at this moment is hide the rulers of the "document". The picture have two controls, the one in the top is the <code>RichControlEdit</code>, in the bottom a normal <code>TextEdit</code>, who is the look that I need to have in the <code>RichControlEdit</code></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LDokN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LDokN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
