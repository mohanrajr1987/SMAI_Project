<p>I installed the base package to compile C++ with MinGW Installer GUI and CMake. I created a simple file .c with hello world, and can use cmake . -G"MSYS Makefiles" normally. I added E:\Programmation\MinGW\bin and E:\Programmation\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin to my path.</p>  <p>Here is my CMakeLists.txt:</p>  <pre><code>cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.3)  project (Prototype)  set (EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH bin/${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE})  file (         GLOB_RECURSE          source_files          src/* )  add_executable (     my_exe       ${source_files} ) </code></pre>  <p>Once the makefile is created however, when I use make I'll get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>/bin/sh:/e/Users/MyName/Documents/GitHub/ProjectName/prototype/c/E:/Programmation/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin/make.exe: No such file or directory make.exe": *** [all] Error 127 </code></pre>  <p>I can compile the file main.c just fine with gcc main.c and the exe it produces works, so the problem is with the make.exe.</p>  <p>If I use it in the msys.bat shell, located in E:\Programmation\MinGW\msys\1.0, it works as it should. So my guess is that the problem is with Powershell and the path. I'm thinking maybe it's because of the way hard drives are designated, since in the error I get it calls my E:\ disk /e/ first then E:/. When I work in msys.bat I have to write it this way: /e/Users/MyName...</p>
