<p>I'm in the process of learning c, and trying to get my head around makefiles. I'm following Learn C the Hard way.</p>  <p>On exercise 2, the extra credit states to make a command in my makefile that allows me to compile my .c file by typing just "make".</p>  <p>My makefile is:</p>  <pre><code>CLAGS=-WALL -g  all: ex1  clean:     rm ex1 </code></pre>  <p>This works - i.e. typing make clean removes the ex1 file, and typing make compiles ex1.c into an executable. </p>  <p>However, I'm confused as to why in the clean command, rm ex1 has to be indented on the line below clean, but for the all command, if I indent ex1 on the line below all, it throws an error. Why is this?</p>  <p>My other question is - how exactly does this work? Is all just a keyword that goes along the lines of "when make (with no command) is typed, do this"?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
