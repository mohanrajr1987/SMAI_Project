<p>I just installed <a href="https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/" rel="nofollow">RtMidi</a> for a project and compiled it. The examples in the <code>tests</code> folder work and so does my code if I put it in the folder and include it in the Makefile that compiles all the examples. How can I use RtMidi in a project with <code>#include &lt;RtMidi.h&gt;</code> instead of having my code in the tests folder? More specifically, what should I put in my Makefile? I've read a bit about dynamic and static libraries but I have no idea what I should be looking for. I've tried adding <code>-llibrtmidi</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib/librtmidi.a</code> without success.</p>
