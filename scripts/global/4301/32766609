<p>I use the following autotool steps to install my pacakges:</p>  <pre><code>./configure make make install prefix=/my/path </code></pre>  <p>However I got the following libtool warning "<strong>libtool: warning: remember to run 'libtool --finish /usr/local/lib</strong>' and "<strong>libtool: warning: 'lib/my.la' has not been installed in '/usr/local/lib'</strong>" when using the autotool to install my software package. If I change to the following command, the problem disappear:</p>  <pre><code>./configure make prefix=/my/path make install prefix=/my/path </code></pre>  <p>It looks like the first method doesn't substitute the <code>prefix</code> correctly to libtool. How can I avoid this problem?</p>
