<p>I have a question about makefile (not talking about Linux shell or bash here). What is the difference between semicolon and double ampersand in a make file?</p>  <p>On the first computer, the following works:</p>  <pre><code>cd code; ant clean compile jar run </code></pre>  <p>On the second computer, the above doesn't work while the below works:</p>  <pre><code>cd code &amp;&amp; ant clean compile jar run </code></pre>  <p>The above code is inside the file called "makefile". I want to know the difference between '&amp;&amp;' and ';'.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Note: My error message for semicolon on second computer is </p>  <pre><code>cd code; ant clean compile jar run The system cannot find the path specified. make: *** [runant] Error 1 </code></pre>
