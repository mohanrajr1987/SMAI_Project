<p>I have a drush generated make file which I execute to download the necessary components and create a full drupal-panopoly file structure.</p>  <p>The file begins as follows:</p>  <pre><code>    ; Drush make file for Panopoly site.      ; Drupal core     ; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------     api = 2     core = 7.x     projects[drupal] = 7.39     projects[panopoly] = 1.25      ; Include any additional changes to the Panopoly make file.     projects[panopoly][patch][] = patches/panopoly-views-clean-row-classes-1360186-33.patch     projects[panopoly][patch][] = patches/panopoly-file_entity_update-2375595-4.patch     projects[panopoly][patch][] = patches/panopoly-wysiwyg_filter-area-map-1508346-4.patch     .     .     . </code></pre>  <p>The make file is a coulpe of hundred lines long. Alot of the lines below the short clip above execute successfully but the first line of the patch section above fails with an error as below:</p>  <pre><code> &gt;&gt; Unable to download patches/panopoly-views-clean-row-classes-1360186-33.patch. [error] </code></pre>  <p>Please notice that all the patches are contained in a directory local called <em>patches</em>.</p>  <p>I decided to comment out the offending patch, the first line, so the drush make process could execute successfully. However, the second patch was complained about. I commented out the second patch and then the third patch generated an error.</p>  <p><strong>It takes commenting out all three patches for the make file to execute successfully but the drupal site installs with errors.</strong></p>  <p>Below is a the file structure of my make directory which has the patches directory and the files it contains with 777 permissions, just incase permissions was the problem.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QsU8p.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QsU8p.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>Can anyone give me an insight on why drush can't/won't read these patch files and how I can fix that problem?</strong></p>
