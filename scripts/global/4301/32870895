<p>GNU Make has a <code>-t</code> flag to update the timestamp of target files as if they had been rebuilt. Some of my targets are symlinks, and I want GNU Make to update the timestamp of the symlink, not the referenced file.</p>  <ul> <li>GNU Make has the <code>-L|--check-symlink-times</code> option to <em>read</em> timestamps from symlinks instead of their referenced files, so it's at least aware of a related issue.</li> <li>The <code>touch</code> command has the <code>-h|--no-dereference</code> flag which is exactly the behavior I'm looking for.</li> </ul>  <p>But is it possible to invoke this kind of behavior while running <code>make -t</code>?</p>
