<p>I know about <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/rake/rdoc/Rake/TestTask.html" rel="nofollow">Rake::TestTask</a>.</p>  <p>But, how would I write a Makefile to achive similar functionality?</p>  <p>I want to be able to run all my Ruby tests by running:</p>  <pre><code>make test </code></pre>  <p>It'd also be nice to have a way to run one test file, e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>TEST=just_one_file.rb make test </code></pre>  <p>I use MiniTest.</p>  <p>I want this because I like Make, and I want to start using it more.</p>  <p>I figured seeing this example would help me.</p>  <p>I also don't understand what rake test does under the scenes, so seeing the Makefile might help me understand how tests run.</p>
