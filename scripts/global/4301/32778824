<p>I have created <code>External Build System</code> project to build and test my C executables (at the top of CMake project for ARM cross-compilation). Unfortunately, I am not able to debug my program using breakpoints - Xcode is completely ignoring them. Steps I did so far inside <em>Scheme</em>:</p>  <ul> <li>Checked <code>Debug executable</code>.</li> <li>Checked <code>Use custom working directory</code>.</li> <li>Added <code>-g</code> flag to <em>Makefile</em>.</li> </ul>
