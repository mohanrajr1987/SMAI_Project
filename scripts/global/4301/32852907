<p>So I am having quite a bit of trouble trying to get a makefile to work with my project. As it stands I am getting an error that states</p>  <p>make: *** No rule to make target <code>../obj/Game.o', needed by</code>jamoo'.  Stop. my file system is set up like this</p>  <pre><code>makefile /src     .cpp files /include     .h files /obj </code></pre>  <p>and here is the makefile.</p>  <pre><code># MODULES are the names of files without extensions to be compiled MODULES = Game Map Door_Node Floor_Tile Room_Node #SOURCES are the .cpp files SOURCES = $(addsuffix .cpp, $(MODULES)) #DEPS are the .hpp files we are compiling against DEPS = $(SOURCES: .cpp=.hpp) # OBJS are the .o files that we compile to before linking OBJ = $(SRC:.cpp=.o) # CC is the compiler CC = g++ # Compiler Options CFLAGS = -o jamoo -I -Werror -Wall  # Library Linking Options LFLAGS =  ../obj/%.o: ../src/%.cpp ../include/%.hpp     $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LFLAGS)  jamoo: $(patsubst %, ../obj/%.o, $(MODULES))     $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LFLAGS)  clean:     rm jamoo </code></pre>  <p>I think the issue is that make is unable to resolve the file system, but I don't know how to write the makefile to do so. Thank you for any help.</p>
