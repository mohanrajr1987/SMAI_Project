<p>I've read numerous tutorials and stackex questions/answers, but apparently my questions is too specific and my knowledge too limited to piece together a solution. </p>  <p><strong>[Edit]</strong> <em>My confusion was mostly due to the fact that my project required both a shell script and a makefile to run a simple python program. I was not sure why that was necessary, as it seemed like such a roundabout way to do things. It looks like the makefile and script are likely just there to make the autograder happy, as the kind respondents below have mentioned. So, I guess this is something best clarified with the prof, then. I really appreciate the answers--thanks very much for the help!</em></p>  <p>Basically, what I want to do is to run <code>program.py</code> (my source code) via <code>program.sh</code> (shell script), so that when I type the following into the command line</p>  <pre><code>./program.sh arg1 </code></pre>  <p>it runs <code>program.py</code> and passes <code>arg1</code> into the program as though I had manually typed the following into the command line</p>  <pre><code>$ python program.py arg1 </code></pre>  <p>I also need to automatically set <code>program.sh</code> to executable, so that <code>$ chmod +x program.sh</code> doesn't have to be typed beforehand.</p>  <p>I've read the solution presented <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8073561/how-to-make-an-executable-to-use-in-a-shell-python">here</a>, which was very helpful, but this seems to require that the file be executed with the <code>.py</code> extension, whereas my particular application requires a <code>.sh</code> extension, so as to be run as desired above. </p>  <p>Another reason as to why I'd like to run a <code>.sh</code> file is because I also need to somehow include a makefile to run the program, along with the script (so I'm assuming I'd have to include a <code>make</code> command in the script?). </p>  <p>Honestly, I am not sure why the makefile is necessary for python programs, but we were instructed by the prof that the makefile would simply be more convenient for the grading scripts, and that we should simply write the following for the makefile's contents:</p>  <pre><code>all:    /bin/true </code></pre>  <p>Thanks so much in advance for any help in this matter! </p>
