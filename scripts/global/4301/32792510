<p>Using Xcode 6 or 7 on OS X Yosemite (fully patched), I have this line at file scope:</p>  <pre><code>static const vector&lt;uint8_t&gt;addresses = vector&lt;uint8_t&gt;({0x10, 0x12, 0x73}); </code></pre>  <p>It compiles and executes fine as part of a cpp file. When I then create a makefile and try to build, I get 'error: expected expression' pointing at the left brace. I've played around with various syntax forms, and nothing works although the errors change. I've tried both g++ and clang as the compiler, to no effect. </p>  <p>Can anyone please suggest why this compiles and runs with Xcode, but not with a simple make? Better yet, what is it about the syntax I'm using that's not what it should be?</p>  <p>I've tried various language dialects as compiler options, but otherwise the makefile is purely using defaults.</p>
