<p>For homework I had to create some program, but the professor wants us to have a makefile to compile and run the program.  I did some research but all I could find was instructions for c programs.  I am unsure about how to do it for java.</p>  <p>the package name for the program is <code>sysoft</code> </p>  <p>the <code>.java</code> files are inside <code>src/sysoft/</code></p>  <p>the <code>.java</code> files' names are <code>fileReader.java</code>, <code>hashTable.java</code>, and <code>mainClass.java</code></p>  <p>and the program should take one argument</p>  <p>I would really appreciate your help.</p>
