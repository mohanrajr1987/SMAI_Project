<p>I have a small issue with a game that I published to the Windows App Store using Unity3D.</p>  <p>After a few submissions, my game passed certification and is now on the store. However, I noticed that in my submission it shows the following "failures":</p>  <p><strong>Content Policies</strong>: 11.11 Required Rating Certificates If a rating under any particular rating system is required by law in any country, you must assign a rating to your app. If applicable law also requires documentation, include the rating documentation for that rating system along with your app.</p>  <p><strong>Locations</strong>: Metadata</p>  <p><strong>Notes To Developer</strong> The app is a game that targets Korea and/or Brazil and/or Russia for distribution, but does not have a valid game rating certificate.</p>  <p>My game does not target Korea, Brazil, or Russia for distribution, but I still get this message. Is there something I'm missing?</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
