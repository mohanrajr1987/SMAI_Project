<p>I have three iOS production certificates and I one to create a new one for a new app I'm building. However, when I go to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/certificateCreate.action" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/certificateCreate.action</a> the option of "App Store and Ad Hoc" for Production environment is grayed out. </p>  <p>Anyone else experiencing this - or know the reason? </p>
