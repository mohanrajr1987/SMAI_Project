<p>This is my situation.</p>  <pre><code>client -&gt; http proxy -&gt; remote web server </code></pre>  <p>LDAP ports and HTTP ports are blocked on firewall at client.</p>  <p>When sending request client must check CRL of remote web server's certificate to verify it's origin. </p>  <p>We did set <code>ServicePointManager.CheckCertificateRevocationList = true;</code> to do that and it works fine in a setup without a proxy. With proxy, we get the following error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure   channel.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Servers CRL file is accessible via IE in same setup.</p>  <p>I have looked around, but found nothing.</p>
