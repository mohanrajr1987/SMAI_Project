<p>I have a app (.NET) that automatically adds a certificate to the Windows root store via:</p>  <pre><code>X509Store rootStore = new X509Store(StoreName.Root, StoreLocation.LocalMachine); rootStore.Open(OpenFlags.ReadWrite); rootStore.Add(certificate); rootStore.Close(); </code></pre>  <p>Internet Explorer then knows this certificate. But Firefox don't as it has its own certificate store.</p>  <p>Is there any way to accomplish this without overriding current Firefox certificates (read somewhere to copy cert8.db but thats not possible due to multiple customers)?</p>  <p>I simply want to automatically "add" one certificate to the Firefox store. </p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
