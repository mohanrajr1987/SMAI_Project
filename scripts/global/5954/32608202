<p>I hope everyone is going well. </p>  <p>I have a problem on my redhat server. Indeed I tried to extract a private key from a keystore using a Java keytool.</p>  <p>Here is the command: </p>  <pre><code>keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore certicates.ks -destkeystore new-store.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 </code></pre>  <p>When I'm typing the source keystore password I have the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>keytool error java.io.ioexception invalid keystore format</p> </blockquote>  <p>I heard that I had to delete a file or something like that but I don't know which one... I don't want to mess everything.</p>  <p>I will really appreciate if you can share your knowledge about this.</p>
