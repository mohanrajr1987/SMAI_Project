<p>I'm trying to grant private key permission to specpfic account on Windows Server 2003</p>  <p>I've followed the steps desribed in this aricle from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384088(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a> using <code>WinHttpCertCfg.exe</code></p>  <p>However, this is what I'm getting</p>  <p><strong>Result</strong></p>  <pre><code>Error: Access was not successfully obtained for the private key.        This can only be done by the user who installed the certificate. </code></pre>  <p><strong>Notes from MDSN</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>The user must have sufficient privileges to use this tool, which   requires the user to be an administrator and the <strong>same user who   installed the client certificate</strong>, if installed. The   "WinHttpCertCfg.exe" tool is not useful to configure certificates   stored in a file system such as FAT32, which does not support access   control lists (ACL).</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>  <p>I'm not sure which user installed the certificate on the server, </p>  <p><code>mmc.exe</code> doesn't give much information.</p>  <p>is there a way find this out? Thanks in advance</p>
