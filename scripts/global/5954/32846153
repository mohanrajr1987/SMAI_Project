<p>I'm attempting to add a custom <code>cer</code>-certificate to my PHP cURL request, but I keep getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>error setting certificate verify locations:   CAfile: /path/to/my/cert.cer   CApath: none </code></pre>  <p>All I've found about this error is that:</p>  <ol> <li><p><strong>The path is relative.</strong><br> As you can see, I've supplied an absolute path.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The path is erroneous.</strong><br> I've tried to <code>var_dump(file_exists($certLocation));</code>, which gives me <code>true</code>, so this is not the case.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The permissions on the file are incorrect.</strong><br> I've set the permissions to <code>777</code> for debugging purposes. Error remains.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The path to the file doesn't have <code>+x</code>-permissions somewhere in the chain.</strong><br> I've set this as well, ensuring that the entire path from root has <code>+x</code>-permissions, and still no luck.</p></li> </ol>  <p>I'm at a loss here, having tried everything I can find, and fact is, <em>I don't even understand what the error actually means.</em> What is a <code>verify location</code>? All I can understand is that there's an error with loading the file.</p>  <p>Any light shed on this is greatly appreciated. See code example below.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>Code I use:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  $oCurl = curl_init($this-&gt;baseUrl); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, 1); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, $this-&gt;timeout); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, $this-&gt;connectionTimeout); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2); curl_setopt($oCurl, CURLOPT_CAINFO, "/tmp/cert.cer"); </code></pre>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>error setting certificate verify locations:   CAfile: /tmp/cert.cer   CApath: none </code></pre>
