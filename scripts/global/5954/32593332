<p>I'm working on an application that runs some applets with self-signed certificates, but java 8 blocks applets with self-signed certificates... and now users who updated their Java version can't use the applets, a big trouble!</p>  <p>My company bought a trusted certificate, and now I'm trying to sign the applets with this certificate.</p>  <p>The old signature is this in build.xml: (it signs when I run Ant to create the .EAR) </p>  <pre><code>&lt;signjar keystore="${web.etc}/company.ks" storepass="pass" alias="aliasname" lazy="yes" maxmemory="256m"&gt;             &lt;fileset dir="${docroot}/applets/appletName/" includes="${appletName.name}" /&gt; &lt;/signjar&gt;   </code></pre>  <p>I received a new key with <code>.jks</code> extension but I can't just put the new key on the old's folder and change the <code>keystore</code> and <code>storepass</code>, it doesn't work... build fails.</p>  <p>Has anyone already done something similar?</p>  <p>Need I write something in the manifest of the jars?</p>
