<p>I've recently come across an article explaining how to code-sign files and the tutorial mentioned using the Apple Root CA certs and Intermediate Certs to do the job, as well as links to the Apple PKI, but never explains how to use them or what they are. </p>  <p>I've tried to find supporting documentation that mentions this website, but I haven't come across anything informative. Anyone else know how to take advantage of this?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/</a></p>
