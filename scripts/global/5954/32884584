<p>On the android emulator (android 4.x) it is not possible to install a pkcs12 (<em>.p12 /</em>.pfx) certificate.  I can see the *.p12 file in "Settings->Security->Install from SD card" but the file is grayed out.</p>  <p>I want to use VPN via RSA/Ipsec and i have to install a client certificate. </p>  <p>On an "normal device" there are no problems.</p>  <p>Is there any workaround?</p>
