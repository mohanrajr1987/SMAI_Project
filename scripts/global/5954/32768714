<p>I want to clarify a confusion I have related to Android app certificates (used during installation). </p>  <p>In the web, certificates are used to map a public key with domain / identity (organization). The hash of the details is signed by CA, then verified by the browser.</p>  <p>An Android app ships with a public key. Based on my understanding, the developer could use his own private key, sign the hash of the app, then ship app with his public key. This information is used by installer.</p>  <p>My questions are:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Even if some CA was used, app would still be shipped with CA's public key - does it matter who owns the signing public key ? it could be anyone, as installer will just use it.</p></li> <li><p>Is integrity checking the only thing android app certificate is used for ? App has a no public key like a website, so certificate is not being used to associate some public key with the app. Is there any other purpose for the certificate ?</p></li> </ol>
