<p>I want only my employees to be able to connect to my server from their mobile application.</p>  <p>In addition to a username/password type of security, I would like only pre-approved devices to be able to connect to the server and try to login.</p>  <p>Is there a way to configure some kind of certificate manually on the devices and from the server only allow those devices to connect? SSL maybe?</p>  <p>Ideally, the certificate would be unique to each device (so we can later revoke access to a device).</p>
