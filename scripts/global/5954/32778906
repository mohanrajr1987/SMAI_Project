<p>I have installed a self-signed Certificate on my iOS device, which is used by a webserver. The certificate was sent by eMail, to perform the installation.</p>  <p>Under Setting > General > Profile the certificate is listet. But it is marked with a red text "not verified" (hope it's the correct translation from german "Nicht überprüft").</p>  <p>How can self-signed SSL Certificates installed in iOS 9, so that they will be accepted by Safari, when accessing the website?</p>  <p>To prevent questions: - I have not visited the site before and added an exception for verifiying this sites ssl certificate. - The certificate ist not expired - The certificate contains the right server url</p>
