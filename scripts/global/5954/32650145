<p>im using gradle version 2.7</p>  <p>i have two environment to build kafka, linux and mac;</p>  <p>find that on linux it goes well, but on mac I run into problem below:</p>  <p>To honour the JVM settings for this build a new JVM will be forked. Please consider using the daemon:  https:  docs.gradle.org/2.7/userguide/gradle_daemon.html.</p>  <p>FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.</p>  <ul> <li>What went wrong: A problem occurred configuring root project 'kafka'. Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':classpath'. Could not resolve org.ajoberstar:grgit:0.2.3. Required by: org.apache.kafka:kafka:0.8.3-SNAPSHOT Could not resolve org.ajoberstar:grgit:0.2.3. Could not get resource  https: repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ajoberstar/grgit/0.2.3/grgit-0.2.3.pom. Could not HEAD  https:  repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ajoberstar/grgit/0.2.3/grgit-0.2.3.pom. peer not authenticated</li> </ul>  <p>I assumes that it is the problem of my jre certificate trusting management; I export the certificate(DigiCert Global Root CA) of https:  repo1.maven.org and import the certificate into my own jre; but still the problem appears; can anyone offer help? any idea would be really appreciated.</p>  <p>thanks a lot</p>
