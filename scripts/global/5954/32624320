<p>I'm trying for educational purpose to make a fake VPN server (SSTP) on my local host and make Windows 10 to connect it. (i'm using csharp but it's not important here)</p>  <p>SSTP works over SSL, so i first did a fake very simple HTTPS WebServer to be sure that my root CA and server certificate are working. I tested with Chrome and MS-Edge, they display my message without any warning. (surfing on <a href="https://localhost.net/" rel="nofollow">https://localhost.net/</a>, i added localhost.net in my hosts file and it's the CN name for my certificates too...)</p>  <p>BUT when I set up a VPN connection in Windows 10, it tells me "A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider".</p>  <p>Question: How is it possible that my certificate chain works (without a warning) for MS-Edge, but MS-Windows is refusing it ?</p>
