<p>In Keychain Access -> Keys, I only see 2 keys that were generated by the Certficate Signing Request. And these keys are a single row which do not have any certificates under them.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4aDeg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4aDeg.png" alt="Screenshot Keychain Acesss"></a></p>  <p>In the Pushwoosh IOS integration guide it shows the APNS certifcate under the key's row, but for me it doesn't. </p>  <p>And on exporting the private key as a p12 file, Pushwoosh says its invalid.</p>  <p>How do I create a valid p12 file?</p>
