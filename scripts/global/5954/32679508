<p>I want to have my own login system and it works, except right now I am using ws for websockets instead of wss. So a couple of days Ago I started adapting my website to use ssl so that websocket connection used for login would be secure. I however discovered the nightmare of certificates and the annoyance of browsers rejecting them, confusing long winded nonsense to get it set up on my vps and the like.</p>  <p>I do not wish to use ssl, I wondered if there are any more backdoor ways to go about securing my website which avoid having to pay money to greedy corporations yearly. I like things that are reliable and don't cost me a fortune. The ironic thing is, if I used my site with no ssl there would be no problem with notifications saying the page is not trusted and all that crap. Yet it would be even less secure with no ssl. How can I encrypt data going from a javascript client to server in a way which prevents people capturing packets on a local network, but without ssl? This is what I wish to do and avoid the ssl nightmare completely. </p>  <p>One other thing. I read that google will start ranking sights in it's searches based on if they use ssl. Is this just another greedy corporate way to get people to pay for this certificate nonsense?</p>
