<p>I have my application in google play. I updated my projecto to Gradle and I generated my apk to upload to Google Play. When I tried it I get the next error: the application you are trying to upload is signed with a different fingerprint to apk currently being uploaded. I checked the fingerprint of the certificate and is the same that is uploaded apk. I dont know where is the problem. This is my gradle configuration:</p>  <pre><code>signingConfigs {      release {             storeFile new File("F:\\workspace\\android_keystore\\myKeystore.keystore")             storePassword "pass"             keyAlias "alias"             keyPassword "pass"         }     }      dexOptions {         javaMaxHeapSize "4g"      }      compileOptions {         sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6         targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6     }     buildTypes {         release {             signingConfig signingConfigs.release             minifyEnabled false             proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'         }     }     lintOptions {         abortOnError false     } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance!!</p>
