<p>Since two days I get this error when connecting via HTTPS to my local application running on <code>localhost</code>:</p>  <p>Server has a weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public key</p>  <p>I use latest Mac OSX and latest Google Chrome. My application runs on a Tomcat. How can I create a new self-signed certificate that will be accepted by Google? I just want to continue to develop! So any hack is welcome.</p>
