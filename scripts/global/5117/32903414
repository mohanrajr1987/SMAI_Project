<p>This is more of a theoretical question, but I was wondering if its possible to get the position of a connected bluetooth device relative to the other device, and if so, how difficult is it to implement?</p>  <p>I only need to know the distance to the other bluetooth device, as well as the direction.</p>  <p>The reason I'm asking is because me and a friend are interested in building a robot which follows a connected bluetooth device.</p>
