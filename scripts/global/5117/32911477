<p>In my app I'm able to connected a bluetooth device (an external rfid/nfc reader), and now I would like to use it like a keyboard, without manage every single charater in my app, but using the EditText, because that device send me a string when I press a button.</p>  <p>If I connect this device via the OS bluetooth manager it works like a keyboard.  I would like to have the same behaviour within my code. thanks</p>
