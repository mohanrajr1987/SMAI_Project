<p>I'm writing an app using Swift on Xcode that connects to a bluetooth BLE peripheral. I've established a connection to a the device, and want to read some data from a specific characteristic (specifically FFF1 in service UUID FFF0).</p>  <p>I'm able to request a read of characteristics using the following code if the characteristic that I want to find info for is <code>characteristicx</code>:</p>  <pre><code>peripheral.readValueForCharacteristic(charactericsx) </code></pre>  <p>What I want to know is this: How do I check that this read value is what I'm looking for. I want to be able to do an if statement to check my value against the discovered value for that characteristic. </p>  <p>Eg: If discovered value is X then do something, else if discovered value is Y then do something else.</p>  <p>That's not a very good explanation of what I want to do, but I hope you get the gist. </p>  <p>Anyone know how to go about doing this?</p>
