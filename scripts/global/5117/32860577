<p>I have project relate to Bluetooth Low Energy. I scan all BLE device near and display into screen by a lot different icon. I'm ok that. But I want to check if scan not BLE device, I will show a message "not BLE device is found". I don't have idea about check NULL BLE device. Perhaps you know!?</p>  <p><strong>Here my some code:</strong></p>  <pre><code>    private BluetoothAdapter mBluetoothAdapter;     final BluetoothManager bluetoothManager = (BluetoothManager) getSystemService(Context.BLUETOOTH_SERVICE);     mBluetoothAdapter = bluetoothManager.getAdapter();     mBluetoothAdapter.startLeScan(mLeScanCallback);      private BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback mLeScanCallback = new BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback() {      @Override     public void onLeScan(final BluetoothDevice arg0, int arg1, byte[] arg2) {         // TODO Auto-generated method stub         runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {             @Override             public void run() {                 //TODO add device to screen              });         }     }; </code></pre>
