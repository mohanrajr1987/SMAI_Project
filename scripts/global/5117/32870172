<p>I recently captured the bluetooth traffic for my Android device and I can view all the packet in Wireshark. I want to have a better knowledge of it like printing out contents of the header fields for each packet in a <strong>HUMAN READABLE</strong> manner.</p>  <p>I believe once this is done, I can also do packet resemblance and other interesting things.</p>  <p>So does anyone know if there is any library for bluetooth traffic/packet analysis? </p>
