<p>I am trying to selectively screen and disable certain USB devices.  For that purpose I have written an <code>IOUSBInterface</code> driver that specifies wildcards for <code>idProduct</code>, <code>idVendor</code>, and <code>bcdDevice</code>.  Anytime I do <em>not</em> want to disable a given device, I set <code>probeScore</code> to 0 and return.</p>  <p>The <code>probeScore</code> approach works in almost all cases, and I can see my driver considering each USB device in turn in <code>system.log</code>.  But in the case of the Bluetooth USB Host Controller, the kernel attaches my driver to it despite my probe score of 0.  By comparison, if my driver is not present, the Bluetooth USB Host Controller matches with a probe score of 90,000.</p>  <p>It is true that my driver specifies <code>OSBundleRequired</code> as <code>Root</code>, but the Bluetooth USB Host Controller specifies <code>OSBundleRequired</code> as <code>Safe Boot</code>, which would seem to put them on the same footing.  On the other hand I'm having the same Yosemite Bluetooth problems as others, and my Bluetooth mouse doesn't respond until after I login, suggesting that the Bluetooth USB Host Controller might not be getting loaded until after boot time.</p>
