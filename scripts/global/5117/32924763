<p>I am looking for a fitness band which provides direct real-time sensor data over Bluetooth to a mobile (Android) app. I want to write a health app that tracks the heart rate continuously. Most of the bands I found, does not provide direct access and the sensor data needs to be synchronized over the web.</p>  <p>While searching I came across the “Microsoft Band”. Their website (<a href="http://developer.microsoftband.com/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.microsoftband.com/</a>) says it provides data directly over Bluetooth. But I also found out that for an third party Android app to access the sensor data one has to install “Microsoft Health” app beforehand. Hence I am in doubt whether the data for the Microsoft Band also gets synchronized over the web through the Microsoft Health app or not.</p>  <p>Can someone please clarify my doubt, i.e. whether the sensor data can be access directly at real-time or not. I just want to be sure before buying the product.</p>
