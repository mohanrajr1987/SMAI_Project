<p>If my understanding is correct, the first 9 bytes of the payload of an advertisement packet for iBeacons is the iBeacon prefix. Bytes 6-7 is the company identifier code, and for iBeacon advertisement packets, it is <code>4C 00</code> (== <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers" rel="nofollow">Apple</a>).</p>  <p>Since the iBeacon packets are "signed" by Apple, is the protocol proprietary? If it was open, the advertisements shouldn't be bound to Apple - right?</p>  <p>If it was proprietary, could the iBeacon packet structure be manipulated?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
