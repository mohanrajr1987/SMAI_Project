<p>I have been working with the Azure Mobile Services ToDo sample app for cloud support for a Xamarin.Forms app. Based on <a href="https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/TodoAzure" rel="nofollow">this</a> example.  I am facing an issue with my development. I have built on top of the sample app and added in all of my own functionality. Now I want to start uploading the data to Azure, in my example the <code>int bpm</code>. However, when I add the  following lines:</p>  <pre><code>var data = new entry{ Percentage = bpm }; // initialise new          if (LastBroadcast == 0) { LastBroadcast = bpm; await AddItem(data); }         var BroadcastDifference = LastBroadcast - bpm;         if (BroadcastDifference &gt; 5) {              await AddItem (data);          }  </code></pre>  <p>I get an error <code>The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.</code> in main.cs on the UIApplication line. Why might this be, what have I done wrong? It crashes after about 10 seconds of working. </p>  <p>Entry is the equivalent of ToDoItem in the sample.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
