<p>I am using scanForPeripheralsWithServices to scan for devices by service UUID. When I use some of the standard service UUID values it will work sometimes.</p>  <p>When I try to use custom service UUIDs it often won't find any devices, but if I use nil for the service UUID list it will find those same devices that it doesn't find when I use their service UUID.</p>  <p>What is going on? Could it be because the advertising packet for the devices can only advertise some of its services?</p>
