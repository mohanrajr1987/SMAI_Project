<p>Can any simple embedded device RECEIVE files from mobile phones using bluetooth and/or wifi (at the same time, from multiple phones) without needing too much configuring? Will it need bluetooth and wifi modules separately or will it come with these in built?  I know that we can plug in an USB stick in few devices and turn it into a file server but I need a device to act as more of a RECEIVER rather than server. Any suggestion or even a small discussion of what anyone knows related to this is most welcome. :-)</p>
