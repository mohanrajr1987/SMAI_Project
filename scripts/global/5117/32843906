<p>I am new to android and I am new here too.</p>  <p>I want to know if android api provides some methods to get bluetooth mac address using previous stored bluetooth device name? I searched many examples here and from internet and most of them using list format to show both device name and mac address, what I need is to get one mac address by a known device name.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance if someone here can help me.</p>  <p>Yman</p>
