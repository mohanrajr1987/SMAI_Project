<p>I'm developing iOS application which works as BLE central with custom services and characteristics.</p>  <p>And the peripheral device is developed by a certain vendor.</p>  <p>The system needs pairing between central and peripheral to write characteristic value. And now I have a problem regarding the pairing.</p>  <p>If I delete paring information on central(iPhone) side by [Forget This Device] in [Bluetooth] of [Settings],<br> the paring sequence starts again when my application try to write characteristic value after connection and discover service and characteristic. (Paring dialogue shows on my application)</p>  <p>The sequence is like below,</p>  <pre><code> 1. Complete connection      [_centralMgr centralManager:didConnectPeripheral:]  2. Discover service  [_centralMgr peripheral:didDiscoverServices:]  3. Discover characteristic  [_centralMgr peripheral:didDiscoverCharacteristicsForService:error:]  4. Try to write characteristic value  [_centralMgr peripheral:writeValue:forCharacteristic:tyep:]  5. At this timing, paring  dialog is shown and user tap [Paring] button  6. Complete writing of characteristic value without error  [_centralMgr peripheral:didWriteValueForCharacteristic:error:] </code></pre>  <p>But if I delete paring information on peripheral device side (by reset the device), <strong>the paring sequence doesn't start when my application try to write characteristic value after connection and discover service and characteristic.</strong></p>  <p>Paring dialogue never shows and the response for write request doesn't return.</p>  <p>The sequence is like  below,</p>  <pre><code> 1. Complete connectiton  [_centralMgr centralManager:didConnectPeripheral:]  2. Discover service  [_centralMgr peripheral:didDiscoverServices:]  3. Discover characteristic  [_centralMgr peripheral:didDiscoverCharacteristicsForService:error:]  4. Try to write characteristic  value  [_centralMgr peripheral:writeValue:forCharacteristic:tyep:]  5. At this timing, paring dialog is never shown  6. Response of writing request(in STEP 4.) doesn't return </code></pre>  <p>The vendor of peripheral device is saying that <strong>iPhone doesn't request paring even the peripheral device returns write error</strong>.</p>  <p>But my application(at least application layer in iOS) doesn't did receive the delegate API of writing error.</p>  <p>Is there anyone who have a same problem ? I'd appreciate it if you would provide some hint or information.</p>  <p>Add the code of writing characteristic value</p>  <pre><code>- (void)peripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral didDiscoverCharacteristicsForService:(nonnull CBService *)service error:(nullable NSError *)error {     NSArray* characteristics = service.characteristics;      for (CBCharacteristic* characteristic in characteristics) {         if (characteristic.properties &amp; CBCharacteristicPropertyWrite) {             if ([[characteristic.UUID UUIDString] isEqualToString:MY_CUSTOM_CHARACTERISTIC]) {                 NSData* data = MY_CUSTOM_DATA;                 [peripheral writeValue:data forCharacteristic:characteristic type:CBCharacteristicWriteWithResponse];                 NSLog(@"writeValue:%@", data);             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>In both case(after deleting pairing info. on central/peripheral side), it discovers completely the same characteristic and write same data.</p>  <p>But only in the latter case(deleted on peripheral side), pairing sequence doesn't start.</p>
