<p>About this problem I have tried to search on the Internet for a long time. Here are something I got.</p>  <p>I found a package called <code>BlueZ</code>, on <code>Python</code> there is a similar package called <code>pyBluez</code>, could find the device, get hardware address, transmission messages etc. And an enhancement package called <code>LightBlue</code>(<a href="http://lightblue.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">LightBlue: a cross-platform Python Bluetooth API</a>), this pack could Sending and receiving files over OBEX, but it just available for <code>Mac OS X</code>, <code>GNU/Linux</code>. I can write the program by can't use it on windows platform. And I didn't find any solution to get file list from that. :-(</p>  <p>Later I found a set of commend line tools from <a href="http://bluetoothinstaller.com/bluetooth-command-line-tools/" rel="nofollow">bluetoothinstaller.com</a>. It's really powerful, could do things <code>light blue</code> can do, including get file list! but I did't find a way to get file list in a multi-level path on my phone(Android 5.0.2), I have sent an e-mail to the author but didn't get any respond yet. (sad...</p>  <p>A software called <code>WCL phone explorer</code> on windows could do that thing, So I believe that this function can be implemented.</p>  <p>Does any one got some idea? I'm a student so I don't care about the language, the package anything because I have enough time to learn it. :-)</p>  <p>PS: if using bluetooth is not the best way to do this, is there a better solution could get file list from an Android phone except <code>wifi</code> or <code>gprs</code>? I really want to know that.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
