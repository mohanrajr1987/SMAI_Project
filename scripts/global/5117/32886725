<p>my app shall connect to a Bluetooth LE device. Usually you perform a device scan using <code>mBluetoothAdapter.startLeScan(mLeScanCallback);</code>. The callback provides you information about available devices. </p>  <p>If you want to connect to a dedicated device, you do something like </p>  <pre><code>BluetoothDevice device = mBluetoothAdapter.getRemoteDevice(address); </code></pre>  <p>and then</p>  <pre><code>mBluetoothGatt = device.connectGatt(this, false, mGattCallback); </code></pre>  <p>To me it looks like the only thing you need to connect to a BLE device, is to know the BLE address and then connect to it with the above two steps. So if I know a BLE address already (e.g. it is written on the label of the BLE device) I donâ€™t need to perform a BLE scan.</p>  <p>But what I have encountered is, that if I have a BLE device which I have never found through a BLE scan before, it is not possible to connect to it directly in using its BLE address. I have to find it through a scan at least one time with my android phone. Afterwards I never need a scan again and I can connect to the BLE device just by using its BLE address.</p>  <p>Is it supposed to be like this or did I oversee something?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot, Stefan</p>
