<p>I have a headset device and it connected to my phone. I tried to program to turn on the speaker of phone (Because I want to transfer my voice from the headset to my phone). However, It did not work although I called setSpeakerphoneOn(true). The problem is that the my voice is hear in my headset, instead of my speaker phone. Could you see my configure and let me know what is problem? Thanks</p>  <pre><code>_audioManager = (AudioManager) getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE); _audioManager.startBluetoothSco(); _audioManager.setMode(AudioManager.STREAM_VOICE_CALL);  _audioManager.setSpeakerphoneOn(true); setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.MODE_IN_CALL);  int maxJitter = AudioTrack.getMinBufferSize(SAMPLE_RATE, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT); track = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION, SAMPLE_RATE, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, maxJitter, AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM); </code></pre>
