<p>I have a simple Fragment within my Activity in which I enable and disable Bluetooth adapter and I want to listen to Bluetooth Adapter state changes with a BroadcastReceiver from within the Fragment. The reason is that I want to directly change the Fragment's UI elements upon Bluetooth state change. This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>public class FragmentBT extends Fragment {     @Override     public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)     {         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);         IntentFilter iFilter = new IntentFilter(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_STATE_CHANGED);         LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(getActivity()).registerReceiver(BtStateChangedReceiver, iFilter);     }      @Override     public void onDestroy()     {         super.onDestroy();         LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(getActivity()).unregisterReceiver(BtStateChangedReceiver);     }      public BroadcastReceiver BtStateChangedReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver()     {         @Override         public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent)         {             ... change UI based on the extra data from intent ...         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>When I enable or disable BT in my device using Action Buttons in my Fragment's ActionBar, the BT goes on and off, but my receiver never gets called. I never get into the receiver's onReceive method. I realize this is a pretty common question here, but I tried the sollutions from several but neither worked (and all are incorporated into my current code).</p>  <p>Thank you for any advice!</p>
