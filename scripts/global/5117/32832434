<p>I'm interested in using an off-the-shelf Bluetooth "Key-finder"/"Camera Trigger" keyfob (like this: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00XBJZX4K" rel="nofollow" title="iTag IT-O6">iTag IT-O6</a>) to remote control a BeagleBone Black (running Debian Linux). The idea is to be able to use one or more inexpensive keyfobs to trigger unique things on the BBB.</p>  <p>A <a href="https://www.bluegiga.com/en-US/products/bled112-bluetooth-smart-dongle/" rel="nofollow" title="BlueGiga BLED112">BlueGiga BLED112</a>, Bluetooth USB dongle on the BBB, will apparently allow me to access its radio features through software (that I can figure out how to write) using a serial protocol.</p>  <p>Would it hypothetically be possible to pair one or more keyfobs with the USB dongle and detect which was pressed in software running on the USB Linux host?</p>  <p>Does anyone know of, or have code that does anything similar? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts!</p>
