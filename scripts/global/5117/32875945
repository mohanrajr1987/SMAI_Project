<p>I made an application 2 years ago on Windows 8.1 using the api Bluetooth RFCOMM. My application succeed connecting on my bluetooth devices on Windows 8.1 devices. But since Windows 10, the same app doesn't work anymore, Indeed my device does not manage to connect to my bluetooth device anymore. I tried to create a Windows 10 app that failed connecting to my device by respecting the new guideline. For me I think th eproblem comes from the api or Windows 10 I would like to know if someone else met this problem and how you solved it . Thanks you for your help</p>
