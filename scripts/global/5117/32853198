<p>I am writing a Android app which allow connecting two BLEs at the same time, then I can send signal to write and read to two BLEs at the same time also. (after some testing) It's working fine for ASUS Memo Pad 7 (4.4.2) and Samsung S4, but not for Moto G (4.4.4) and Nexus 7 which disconnected one and wrote to the other when I tried to write to both at the same time. I don't want to set delay between both devices because I want to signal to both as long as user keep pressing button. That was only four device I tested right now. Did anyone know why it's not working for those devices? is it hardware issue? how do I know which Android devices support to read and write multiple BLE at the same time?</p>
