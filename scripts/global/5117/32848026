<p>I have a pair of bluetooth headphones that when paired to an Iphone will report how much battery life it has left. It does not do this when connected to a Mac. I ran system_profiler and located the device as per the below.</p>  <p>Is there a command I can run in order to poll the headset for the battery life left?</p>  <pre><code>Devices:      BlueBuds X:        Default Input Device: Yes       Input Channels: 1       Manufacturer: ffff       Current SampleRate: 8000       Transport: Bluetooth      BlueBuds X:        Default Output Device: Yes       Manufacturer: ffff       Output Channels: 2       Current SampleRate: 44100       Transport: Bluetooth    Devices (Paired, Configured, etc.):       BlueBuds X:           Address: 44-5E-F3-A6-6D-F6           Major Type: Audio           Minor Type: Headset           Services:            Paired: Yes           Configured: Yes           Connected: Yes           Manufacturer: STMicroelectronics (0x5, 0x2F)           Class of Device: 0x04 0x01 0x240404           RSSI: -56           Role: Master           Connection Mode: Sniff Mode           Interval: 1280 ms           EDR Supported: Yes           eSCO Supported: Yes           SSP Supported: Yes </code></pre>  <p>I have attempted to Google this question but cannot locate any basic information on commands available to poll a device. I just want to be able to get the amount of battery life left from the headset. I am using Mac OS 10.</p>
