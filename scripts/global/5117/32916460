<p>If my understanding is correct, there is a large range of UUIDs assigned in the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers/service-discovery" rel="nofollow">specification</a> - but then there's also <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServicesHome.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>  <p>Since an iBeacon's UUID can be customised, wouldn't the UUID conflict with existing codes and create undesirable outcomes?</p>  <p>If my understanding is correct, the service UUIDs are at byte 30 and 31 of the BLE packet, which is overlapped by iBeacon's UUIDs. Service UUIDs are only 2 bytes so it can't be hard for collision to occur.</p>
