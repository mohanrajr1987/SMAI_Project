<p>I am working on a bluetooth application which receives data from some device. When I am using 'Debug' option from Android studio and debugs through the application, I get proper response, but as soon as I remove breakpoints the messages are received incomplete, and my application crashes.</p>  <p>Any possible solutions...?</p>  <p>I am reading the input stream as follows :</p>  <pre><code>bytes += mmInStream.read(buffer, bytes, buffer.length - bytes); mHandler.obtainMessage(1, begin, bytes, buffer).sendToTarget(); </code></pre>
