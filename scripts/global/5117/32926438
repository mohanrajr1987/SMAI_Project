<p>I have a simple board with a Bluetooth module on it, and an android phone communicates to it a pulls information and data from it. However, our customers were saying that it was using too much battery life.</p>  <p>So, we have experimented with Bluetooth Low Energy, however, we think Bluetooth classic is the best for our current scenario.</p>  <p>Is there anyway, as the developer on the Android client side of things that I can do to minimize battery usage for the board with the Bluetooth module?</p>  <p>I.e. queuing up commands, processing them differently, etc.</p>  <p>Just to be clear, I am not looking to increase battery life on the phone, but rather the board with the Bluetooth module on it.</p>
