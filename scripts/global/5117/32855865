<p>I am running an app that communicates from my Mac to my iPhone via bluetooth and vice versa. It is all working perfectly (with two generated characteristics one from Mac to iPhone and one from iPhone to Mac) apart from, occasionally my characteristic from mac to iPhone is not being updated and I think this is due to the charachteristic on the mac being set to nil for no apparent reason.</p>  <p>So to update my char on my Mac I do:</p>  <pre><code>- (void)updateValueForCharacteristic:(int)sendID {     NSLog(@"sent %d", sendID);      if (self.characteristic != nil) {         dispatch_block_t block = ^(void) {             NSData *value = [NSData dataWithBytes:&amp;sendID length:sizeof(sendID)];             [_managerout updateValue:value forCharacteristic:self.characteristic onSubscribedCentrals:nil];         };          dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);         dispatch_async(queue, block);     }else{         //why is this sometimes being called?!     } } </code></pre>  <p>and to receive on the iPhone I do:</p>  <pre><code>- (void)peripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral didUpdateValueForCharacteristic:(CBCharacteristic *)characteristic error:(NSError *)error {     if (error != nil) {         NSLog(@"Error updating value: %@", error.localizedDescription);          return;     }      CBUUID *characteristicUUID = [CBUUID UUIDWithString:_kCharacteristicUUIDin];     NSInteger rec = 0;     [characteristic.value getBytes:&amp;rec length:sizeof(rec)];     NSLog(@"recieved %ld", (long)rec);      if ([characteristic.UUID isEqual:characteristicUUID]) {         NSLog(@"officially recieved %ld", (long)rec);         //handle char (sometimes not noticing)     } } </code></pre>  <p>Is there anyway that I can verify that my iPhone has received the char. Also should I scrap this technique and try with writing (rather than updating) the char or maybe try with multiple chars rather than just the one?</p>  <p>I really need to make sure that the iPhone gets it or else the program is useless.</p>  <h1>update</h1>  <p>I have added an <code>else</code> block to <code>if (self.characteristic != nil) {</code> and the else block is being called when my char isn't being updated!!! But I can't find for the life of my why the self.characteristic is being set to nil?! And also how should I go about re-creating the characteristic after?</p>
