<p>I am trying to compare the MAC address from a paired device to make sure its one of two known addresses in the app. I am using the following to get the device</p>  <pre><code>    Set&lt;BluetoothDevice&gt; pairedDevices = mBluetoothAdapter.getBondedDevices();     if (pairedDevices.size() &gt; 0) {         BluetoothAdapter btAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();         BluetoothDevice device = btAdapter.getRemoteDevice(address1);         mmDevice = device;     } </code></pre>  <p>So what i want to do is something like</p>  <pre><code>if(foundMacAddress == address1){         BluetoothDevice device = btAdapter.getRemoteDevice(address1); }else{         BluetoothDevice device = btAdapter.getRemoteDevice(address2); } </code></pre>  <p>However i am uncertain as to how i can retrieve and compare the MAC address.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
