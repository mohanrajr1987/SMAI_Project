<p><strong>Hello everyone,</strong></p>  <p>I am trying to build a module in which it has to simply return info about an image's sharing path. The concept is to detect the way an image is shared. This is for both online and offline sharing(bluetooth,etc).</p>  <p><strong>For example</strong>, a processed image is shared to device 'A'. Then info of device A is retrieved and stored. Then image is shared from A to another device 'B'. Then the same is done as well.</p>  <p><strong>Well</strong>, This was my way of approaching this problem. I have no idea on... </p>  <p><strong>1. Which programming language to use</strong> for processing code into an image(the code is executed to retrieve and store the devices info)</p>  <p><strong>2. What knowledge I must have</strong> before jumping into work.</p>  <p><strong>3. Any OpenSource software</strong> that functions the same way so I can grab some ideas for ease.</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>  <p>Since I am not particularly a pro in this field, I would appreciate an answer with much detail and could easily help me understand.</p>
