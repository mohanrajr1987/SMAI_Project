<p>I have a headset device. I want to transfer my voice from the headset to my mobile. The mobile can play my sound via its speaker. Hence, I need to turn of Media audio in default setting (Left image) after headset connect with phone by Bluetooth. I am looking for a solution to turn off Media audio by programming such as right image. Could you suggest to me the solution for my work?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EL2j9.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EL2j9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
