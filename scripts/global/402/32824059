<p>I have 2 groups (data.frame) in R called <code>good</code> and <code>bad</code> which contains good users and bad users respectively. </p>  <p>The group <code>good</code> contains <code>game_id</code> which is the id for a computergame and <code>number</code> which is how many times this game has been played. </p>  <p>For example <code>good$game_id</code> we get <code>1 2 3 ... 20</code>. We have 20 games. Similar <code>good$number</code> we get <code>45214 1254 23 ... 8914</code> which is the number the game has been played. For example has <code>game_id==1</code> been played 45214 times in group <code>good</code>.</p>  <p>Similar for <code>bad</code>.<br> We also have the same number of users in the two groups.</p>  <p>So for <code>head(good,20)</code> we get</p>  <pre><code>game_id  number 1  45214 2  1254 ... 20  8914 </code></pre>  <p>I want to investigate if there is dependence between the number of times a fixed computergame has been played. </p>  <p>For <code>game_id==1</code> I would try to use Pearson's Chi test for 'Independence'.  In R I type <code>chisq.test(good[1,2], bad[1,2])</code> to see if there is indepence between <code>good</code> and <code>bad</code> for <code>game_id==1</code> but I get an error message: <code>x and y must have same levels.</code></p>  <p>How can this problem be solved ?</p>
