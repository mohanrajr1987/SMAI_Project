<p>Reading through documentation as well as other SO posts did not help me find out either <code>InfluxDB</code> supports event listeners/triggers on write operations or not. Because it's meant for real-time analytics, I would like to be notified when a specific point gets inserted in a specific series. I know I could use <code>Continuous Queries</code> but in some cases when data is inserted at much lower, non-constant rates, running <code>CQs</code> on non-changed queries become useless. </p>  <p>The perfect scenario would be to use some event listeners/triggers and query the data when it changes. Does <code>InfluxDB</code> supports it or I have to implement this feature manually?</p>
