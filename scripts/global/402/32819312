<p>say for example i know than an nba game is scheduled at 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and that near the end it goes to overtime. id like to predict what time it actually ends by parsing twitter for predictions.  say the data i receive from twitter for predicted game  end timeare:</p>  <p>11:05 am, 11:07 am, 11:25 am, 10:45 am, 13:05 am, 11:15 am, 11:27 am, ...</p>  <p>what algorithm will best produce the correct answer? all i can think of is just averaging the parsed data. i'm trying to understand other machine learning algorithms but it seems they are too much for what i'm trying to achieve here. if it's not, can you suggest the best algorithm to use for this?</p>
