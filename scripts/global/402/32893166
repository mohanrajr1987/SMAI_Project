<p>I am using R to analyze and compare between cluster k-mean, hierarchical cluster and EM cluster and applied in a dataset. I used <code>cluster.stats</code> for analysis and comparison, but I want to know how I calculate purity or accuracy.</p>  <p>I searched and got these equations but I am having trouble translating them.</p>  <p>Purity = {TP_K}/{(TP+TN+FP+FN)} </p>  <p>Purity = 1/ N sum_{i=1}^k max_j | c_i \cap t_j | </p>
