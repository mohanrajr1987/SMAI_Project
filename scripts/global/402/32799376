<p>I'm trying to write code that would find the median of each column in R as a way for me to better understand for and while loops.  However, I'm not quite sure why its not working and could use some help.</p>  <p>For my for loop, here's what I have now</p>  <pre><code>D=c(1:2000) myMatrix1&lt;-matrix(data = D, nrow = 20, ncol = 100, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = NULL) for(j in 1:100)  for(i in 1:20) m&lt;-median(myMatrix[ ,j]) </code></pre>  <p>The result that m spews out is 1050, and I'm now understanding where that's from.  </p>  <p>I'm not quite sure how to write a while loop for this but here's what I think it is: </p>  <pre><code>C=c(1:2000) myMatrix1&lt;-matrix(data=C, nrow=20, ncol=100, byrow=TRUE, dimnames=NULL) m&lt;-rep(0,100) while (j &lt;= 100) m[j]&lt;-median(myMatrix1[ , j]) </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure why, but it keeps returning C=c(1:2000) for some reason.  Can someone explain this to me?</p>
