<p>I guess to create a better example here, say I have the file mtcars and what I did with it was to export every one of its rows into independent files and place them into empty directories, as such: </p>  <pre><code>for(i in 1:nrow(mtcars)) write.table(mtcars[i,], file=paste(“mtcars”, as.character(i), ".txt", sep=""), row.names=FALSE, sep="\t") </code></pre>  <p>What I want to do is to build a loop so that I can scan a folder, which includes all rows and column names and create a new data frame.  </p>  <p>Here's what I have so far and I think it only does columns but not rows.  </p>  <pre><code>myfiles&lt;-list.files() for(file in mayflies){ if (file=="myrows.txt"){ myrows&lt;-read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep="\t") } else{ tdataset&lt;-read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep="\t") mydataset&lt;-cbind(mydataset, tdataset) rm(tdataset) } } } row.names(meditates)&lt;-myrows </code></pre>  <p>How can I make my results in the above code, make a folder out of it, scan all rows and columns, and eventually create a new data frame with the first set of code listed above?  If you can explain some of the logic to me that would be incredibly helpful.</p>
