<p>I tried to run some of this R code.</p>  <pre><code>library('astsa')  #problem 2.1  set.seed(1999)  # wt = rnorm(80,0,1)  xt = jj yt = log(xt)  trend = time(jj) - 1970 # centering the time Q = factor(rep(1:4,21)) reg = lm(log(jj)~0 + trend +  Q, na.action=NULL) # no intercept model.matrix(reg) summary(reg)  #problem 2.11  # part a) plot(oil) # is it stationary? No its not because there are a lot of jumps  # part b) doil = diff(log(oil)) acf(doil)  # part c) dgas = diff(log(gas)) acf(dgas)  # part d) ccf(doil, dgas)  # part e) lag.plot2(doil, dgas, 3) </code></pre>  <p>After I while I keep getting an error of </p>  <blockquote>   <h1>part e)</h1>      <p>lag.plot2(doil, dgas, 3) Error: could not find function "lag.plot2"</p> </blockquote>  <p>even though I have loaded the astsa library. Has anyone ever reproduced the same error?</p>
