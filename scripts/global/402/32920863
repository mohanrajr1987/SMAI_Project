<p>I'm doing Bayesian inference (manually, using a grid search) in Python. I want to calculate the probability of each model given the data. The problem is I can only calculate the 'evidence' in log, otherwise its 0. So, even though its between 0-1, I can't get the results for: </p>  <pre><code>Pr(data|model1) / (Pr(data|model1) + Pr(data|model2))   </code></pre>  <p>Since each term is 0 in its non-log form.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
