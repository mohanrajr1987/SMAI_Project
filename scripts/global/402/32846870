<p>From statistic of my app I can get number of requests per day. But can I get such statistic grouped by users ? For example: user with id "1" has made 1000 requests on September, 1. </p>  <p>The problem is that some of 10 users, that have been using my app, has made around 3000k requests, and I want to know was it spam, or bug in my program. Unfortunalely, no logger till now was added in my program for such information, and i don't know what happened in the past. Thanks for your reply!</p>
