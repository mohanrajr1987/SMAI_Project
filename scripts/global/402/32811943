<p>Here, I'm looking at the file mtcars in R.  This is one loop that can be used to write columns into 11 separate files, since there are 11 columns in the dataset.  </p>  <pre><code>for(i in (1:length(mtcars[1, ]))) write.table(mtcars[i], file=paste("mtcars", as.character(i), ".txt",  sep=""), row.names=FALSE, sep="\t"); </code></pre>  <p>I'm just curious, how would you do this if you were to change it into writing all columns into separate files?  Right now, I know one modification to make would be that we set the first line length parameter to mtcars[,1] instead, but I'm curious what you can substitute the i with? Are there any other substitutions that need to be made in other parts of the code? </p>  <p>Edit: missing quote</p>
