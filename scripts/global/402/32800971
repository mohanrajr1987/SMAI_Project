<p>I am aware of MATLAB's <code>datasample</code> which allows to select <code>k</code> times from a certain <code>population</code>. Suppose <code>population=[1,2,3,4]</code> and I want to uniformly sample, with replacement, <code>k=5</code> times from it. Then:</p>  <pre><code>datasample(population,k) ans =    1     3     2     4     1 </code></pre>  <p>Now, I want to repeat the above experiment <code>N=10000</code> times without using a for loop. I tried doing:</p>  <pre><code>datasample(repmat(population,N,1),5,2) </code></pre>  <p>But the output I get is (just a short excerpt below):</p>  <pre><code> 1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3  1     3     2     1     3 </code></pre>  <p>Every row (result of an experiment) is the same! But obviously they should be different... It's as though some random seed is not updating between rows. How can I fix this? Or some other method I could use that avoids a for loop? Thanks!</p>
