<p>Would any one happen to know how many different ways there are of attaining the specific shape of a distribution when given a specific mean and a total N observations? </p>  <p>For example, lets say N = total of 3 digits and Mean = 3. <br> Lets say N is defined as the following digits: N= (2,2,5). <br> A histogram would show that the number 2 is about 66.6666666% of my data and 5 is 33.333333%. This histogram has a specific 'shape' when plotted. Is there a way to see how many possible combinations of 3 digit numbers will produce the exact same shape and same mean (3) as well ?</p>
