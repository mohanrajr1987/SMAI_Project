<p>I'm fairly new to R and am looking to do the following:</p>  <p>Say I have a data frame containing data for a regression model I am building. I have the dependent variable in the 1st column and possible independent variables filling in the rest of the data frame. I would like to loop through this data frame and do the following:</p>  <p>1) Plot each independent variable against the dependent (with dependent on the 4th axis) and save</p>  <p>2) Run statistical tests across all variables in the dataframe and save the results (correlation, adf tests, etc...)</p>  <p>I know there's probably a straight-forward process to this. I'm still getting used to the syntax in R - any help would be appreciated.</p>
