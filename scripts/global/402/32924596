<p>I ran the following line:</p>  <pre><code>np.random.multinomial(10, [1/5., 1/5., 1/5., 1/5., 1/5., 1/5.]) </code></pre>  <p>and it produces an output</p>  <pre><code>array([3, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0]) </code></pre>  <p>which means that when I roll a 6 sided dice for 10 times, the above output represents the frequency counts of number of times a particular side showed up. Here, side 1 showed up 3 times, side 2 showed up 4 times and so on.</p>  <p>My question is shouldn't the above method throw an error because the probability values of the sides of the dices sum to > 1/0 ? I am sure I have misunderstood something here but not able to figure out what.</p>
