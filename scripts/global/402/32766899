<p>Please see below image. This image is created by first converting a two-column data frame into a study window (call it study_win) using as.owin, and then plotting another two-columns data-frame (call it study_points)on top of the window.</p>  <p>It is clear that the points are lying inside the window! However when I call </p>  <pre><code>ppp(study_points[,1],study_points[,2],win = study_window)  </code></pre>  <p>it says that most of my points are rejected as lying outside the window. Could someone tell me what is going on? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nKAto.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nKAto.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
