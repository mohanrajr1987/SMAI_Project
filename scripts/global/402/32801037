<p>I've been working on pruning a decision tree (in R) and I had the data cross validated where put that the optimal amount of nodes was 4 nodes (due to my cross validation. I proceeded to try to prune the data to 4 nodes and I get returned a 5 node tree. I compared it to the decision tree of 5 nodes and they look exactly the same.</p>  <p>I'm a bit lost. Why isn't it producing a decision tree of 4 nodes when my cross validation says it is the optimal amount of nodes? Shedding some light on this would help me</p>  <p>Visit: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Rz3NLPf.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/Rz3NLPf.png</a>  for the plots side by side</p>
