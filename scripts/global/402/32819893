<p>For one of our services we are mapping the dependencies of the service components based on how the components of the service interact and provide a response to the user.This mapping of dependencies will be in the form of a graph.</p>  <p>Now ultimately we have to provide a score for the service on how good it is.So for each of the components we collect few performance metrics and see how the data points for that metric are for example the metric can be cpu utilization.</p>  <p>I need some pointers on aggregating the scores for each of these dependencies.</p>  <p>If we should use averages or any other mathematical concepts.</p>
