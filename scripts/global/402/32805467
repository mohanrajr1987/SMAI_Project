<p>In MATLAB, I have a matrix <code>A</code> with data in quite different ranges. How can I best visualize features in the data? If I use <code>boxplot(A)</code> some of the boxplots are squeezed together since some column values are very big while other are very small.</p>  <p>Are there any other ways to visualize data in order to describe different features in data? I imagine there are some standard plots you always use to get a grasp of data.</p>
