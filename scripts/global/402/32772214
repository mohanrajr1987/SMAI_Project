<p>The scenario is this: There are 50 coins in a bag of the following denominations:</p>  <ul> <li>50 cent pieces: 5 </li> <li>25 cent pieces: 10</li> <li>10 cent pieces: 15 </li> <li>5 cent pieces: 20</li> </ul>  <p>You can choose five coins from the bag (without replacement). Order does not matter. Total combinations is 50 choose 5, or 2,118,760, but how many combinations are there where the total is less than $1? Combinations of four or fewer coins are not allowed. You must choose five coins.</p>  <p>Examples: </p>  <p>50 Cent, 25 Cent, 5 cent, 10 cent, 5 cent - GOOD <br> 50 Cent, 25 Cent, 25 cent, 10 cent, 10 cent - NO GOOD </p>  <p>Can this be done using Excel? I want to first generate a list of all of the combinations and then eliminate those results less than $1, but I don't see any way to do that.</p>  <p>Would I be better off using a program other than excel?</p>
