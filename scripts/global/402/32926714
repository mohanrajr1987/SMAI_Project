<p>If this is a dumb question, I apologize. I have a set of random empirical data and I form a CDF from the data points using ecdf. I then want to plot an inverse CDF plot from those same data where probability is on the horizontal axis instead of the data values, and data values are on the vertical axis instead of probability values. How does one do this? Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Example of data could be:</p>  <pre><code>F10 &lt;- ecdf(rnorm(50)) plot(F10, do.points = FALSE)  ## but this gives me the CDF, not the inverse! </code></pre>
