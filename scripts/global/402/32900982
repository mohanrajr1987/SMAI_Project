<p>I am having difficulties reading a report which uses Stata code. I only know very simple basics of Stata, but even help of Google didn't accelerate my work. What does the second part of this code do? There is a standard dataset with columns as labels, and rows as observations for each quarter of different years. I see that time variable is generated and time series is specified. The supporting text says this calculates growth rate (from quarter to quarter), and then normalizes data in some variables. So,</p>  <p>What does </p>  <pre><code>`x'_gr = ..  </code></pre>  <p>part do? I cannot divide it into blocks I would understand.</p>  <p>What does <code>n(10000)</code> part do?</p>  <pre><code>generate JQ = yq(year, q) format JQ %tq sort JQ tsset JQ local  varlist "mine manu constr trade" foreach x of local varlist{ gen `x'_gr=100*(`x'/l.`x' - 1) } set obs 10000 kdensity mine_gr, gen(MINE_KERNEL epanechnikov) n(10000) kdensity manu_gr, gen(MANU_KERNEL epanechnikov_1) n(10000)  kdensity constr_gr, gen(CONSTR_KERNEL epanechnikov_2) n(10000)  kdensity trade_gr, gen(TRADE_KERNEL epanechnikov_3) n(10000) </code></pre>
