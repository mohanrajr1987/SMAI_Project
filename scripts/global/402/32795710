<p>I have loaded an excel table into SAS using this code - </p>  <pre><code>FILENAME REFFILE "/folders/myfolders/subji.xlsx" TERMSTR=CR;           PROC IMPORT DATAFILE=REFFILE           DBMS=XLSX           OUT=ds;           GETNAMES=YES;           RUN; </code></pre>  <p>And then sorted it to apply a repeated measures analysis to it using this sort proc - </p>  <pre><code>PROC SORT DATA=ds; BY subject  Color_Compatibility sameloc; RUN; </code></pre>  <p>And then, ran a univariate ANOVA to retrieve stats and effects using this code - </p>  <pre><code>PROC UNIVARIATE DATA=ds NOPRINT; VAR resprt; OUTPUT OUT=unids1 MEAN=resprt; BY subject Color_Compatibility sameloc; where Color_Compatibility &gt;0 and practice = 0 and outlier = 0 and respAC=1; RUN; </code></pre>  <p>The outlier column is currently calculated through excel, but I've noticed the values excel's STDEV function gives are not accurate. For that reason I want to create an outlier variable with SAS, and then remove every outlier row from my analysis (using +/-2.5 STDEV as a benchmark). How could this be done? Thanks.</p>
