<p>I have built a naive Bayes algo for e commerce site.  </p>  <pre><code>install.packages('e1071')       library('e1071')     RTO_data&lt;-read.csv("C:\\Users\\arpit.sisodia\\Desktop\\DATA FOR ARPIT.csv",header=TRUE)     keeps&lt;-c("CATALOG_NAME","CHANNEL","LOGISTICS_TYPE","CATALOG_NAME","CHANNEL","UNIT_PRICE","PAYMENT_MODE","SHIPPING_STATE","SHIPMENT_SLA","TOTAL_SLAB","PAYMENT","COURIER_NAME","CANCEL_STATUS")        new_RTO_Data&lt;-RTO_data[keeps]    sub &lt;- sample(nrow(new_RTO_Data), floor(nrow(new_RTO_Data) * 0.8)) training &lt;- new_RTO_Data[sub, ] testing &lt;- new_RTO_Data[-sub, ]    nb&lt;-naiveBayes(training$CANCEL_STATUS~.,data=training)    model_prob&lt;-predict(nb,testing,type=c("class"))    table(model_prob,testing$CANCEL_STATUS)    mean(model_prob!=testing$CANCEL_STATUS) </code></pre>  <p>The model has very bad accuracy and missing about 42% based on confusion matrix.My questions are-</p>  <p>0)  Should I check sth else also to validate the model?  </p>  <p>1)  Is there anything I can do to improve model. </p>  <p>2)   Or should I go with some other modelling technique? Suggest !!</p>  <p>Purpose of the model is to predict customers who might not accept the ordered product and this is loss to the company. </p>
