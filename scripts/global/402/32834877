<p>I'm trying to create a skewed random number generator using a skew normal distribution, but I don't know how to turn my formula (which uses <code>NORMDIST()</code>) into a <code>NORMINV()</code>-based formula that can generate the numbers I want. This is my formula:</p>  <pre><code>=2/s * NORMDIST((x-m)/s, 0, 1, 0) * NORMSDIST(k*(x-m)/s) </code></pre>  <p>Where "x" is the number, "s" is the scale, "m" is the location, and "k" is the shape. I admit I found the formula <a href="http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/569764-skew-normal-distribution.html" rel="nofollow">online</a>, but it seems to do what I want to do, except the wrong way around.</p>  <p>How can I do this?</p>
