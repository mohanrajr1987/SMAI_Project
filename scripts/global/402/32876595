<p>I would like to perform a test in R to compare two vectors:</p>  <p>the test should check if the two vectors are keeping the relative order between elements.</p>  <p>for example if the first vector is x=(2,4)</p>  <p>and the second vector is y=(10,20), the two vectors keep the relative order perfectly.</p>  <p>but all of the vectors have more than two elements.</p>  <p>what is a good statistical test which can test if two vectors are keep the relative order to each other?</p>
