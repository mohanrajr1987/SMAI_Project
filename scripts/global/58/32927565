<p>I am a M.Sc CE student, and My thesis is about server load balancing using SDN. I am very much Obligated to you if answer my question. </p>  <p>how can I do tcp session migration? is this possible with TCP_Repair?  You can find some information about TCP_Repair here: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/495304/" rel="nofollow">TCP connection repair</a></p>  <p>My scenario is something like this: I have server farm and I want to Implement Layer 7 load balancer (Content-aware load balancer). For this, I need to get first 4 packet and then allocate a client request to appropriate server in my cluster according to HTTP GET header. I need to establish a TCP connection between client and SDN controller (I have done this part), and I have received HTTP GET message from the client.I already have some information about the content that client need to get (like content name, content length and so on). Next, I need to migrate this TCP connection to one of my servers with have this content and have better status in term of bandwidth utilization and maybe other parameters and change flow table of switch to forward the rest of the packets to this server.  Is it possible with TCP_Repair? I am so confused! If yes and if it is possible for you, Please send me a sample code that indicate using TCP_Repair. Regards</p>
