<p>I use <code>socat</code> for quick telnet banner grabbing, like this:</p>  <pre><code>for ip in $list do     socat -T 1 - tcp:$ip:23 &amp; done </code></pre>  <p>It loops through the list of specified IP addresses, and for each one calls <code>socat</code> which links <code>TCP socket</code> on port 23 with <code>stdin</code> (-) and disconnects after one second, while running in the background. The problem is that all of the background processes use same <code>stdin</code>, so all of them will hang. I tried <code>readline</code> option, as well suppressing <code>stdin</code> with <code>&lt;/dev/null</code>, but with no results. <code>netcat</code>, for example behaves in the same way, unless <code>-d</code> is specified to ignore the input.</p>  <p>The <code>socat</code> line that I specified is a part of a script that is being used for other purposes, so it would be nice if the problem could be solved without resorting to <code>masscan</code>, <code>nmap</code> or <code>netcat</code>. Thank you.</p>
