<p>I want to make me a small GUI version of the <code>GDB</code> command line program on <code>Linux</code> to make debugging of small <code>C</code> programs more easier.  There may exists already some especially in IDEs but I want to make it for fun and get better known to <code>GDB</code>.  </p>  <p>Now I wanted to know whether GDB has a API so I can access GDB commands directly from code and I don't have to make a detour through the terminal for example with <code>popen</code>.</p>  <p>If there does not exists such a API from <code>GDB</code>, whats the simplest way to start <code>GDB</code> hidden and send commands to it, retrieve outputs from it?</p>
