<p>I'm trying to write a program that uses GStreamer to connect to PulseAudio as a source so that I can intercept any audio that's being played. I have no need to play it back so my assumption is that my pipeline only needs a source and demuxer, I'm not sure of the latter though. The hello world example that I'm working off of is <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/manual/html/chapter-helloworld.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, except that instead of using "filesrc" I'm using "pulsesrc".</p>  <p>Is there a good example that shows this out there already and I haven't found the right combination of terms to make Google give it to me? Do you have to do anything to PulseAudio to make it let you monitor its stream? Should I actually be trying to instead connect to a sink to monitor what's being played?</p>
