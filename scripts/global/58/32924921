<p>I found <a href="http://ictclas.nlpir.org/newsdownloads?DocId=389" rel="nofollow">this software for Chinese word segmentation called ICTCLAS</a>.  It's an open-source project written in C/C++/C#/Java. It seems that it's one of the best software to split Chinese text into words.</p>  <p>My goal is to make it work under PHP. So I found <a href="http://www.mantink.com/index.php/archives/5157.html" rel="nofollow">this PHP wrapper for ICTCLAS</a>. This wrapper is written recently, so it should be compatible with the latest version of ICTCLAS. The problem I'm facing right now is to compile ICTCLAS for Linux.</p>  <p>The official distribution package even has libraries for Linux (/lib/linux64/libNLPIR.so), but I am not sure that I can use them directly.</p>  <p>The official documentation (pdf files in the /doc folder) is not very helpful. They recommend running the following commands:</p>  <pre><code>test: ../../../Src/ICTCLAS2013/example-c/Example-C.cpp ../../../Src/ICTCLAS2013/include/NLPIR.h g++ ../../../Src/ICTCLAS2013/example-c/Example-C.cpp -L. -lpthread -L../../../bin/ICTCLAS2013 -lNLPIR -Wall -Wunused -O3 -DOS_LINUX -o ../../../bin/ICTCLAS2013/example </code></pre>  <p>But obviously, the syntax has errors (not to mention that such folders don't exist in the latest distribution package).</p>  <p>Any advice would be really appreciated! ICTCLAS would help me improve my Chinese pinyin converter (easypronunciation.com/en/chinese-pinyin-phonetic-transcription-converter).</p>
