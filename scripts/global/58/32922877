<p>Hi I am using Windows 10, and I want to install Linux mint in Oracle virtual box in Windows.</p>  <p>I have: "VirtualBox-5.0.6-103037-Win.exe" from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" rel="nofollow">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a> "linuxmint-17.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso" from <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=190" rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=190</a></p>  <p>I install virtual box exactly following the instruction and try to install a linux mint virtual machine using the above iso, but I can't get it to work.</p>  <p>This is what happen: 1) After first time run, I choose the above iso 2) wait, do nothing, I expect it automatically lead me to a linux mint desktop where I can see install linux But instead it take me to the linux login place.</p>  <p>This is ridiculous, I didn't create any account, I don't have password and I can't install linux mint like this.</p>  <p>Please help me installing linux on windows using Oracle virtual box, thank you.</p>
