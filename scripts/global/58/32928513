<p>I'm trying to compare 2 strings. One comes from a file through the grep command and the other one never changes because I'm always comparing it with the ones I create while reading file texts. If they are equal, the program should print the data associated with the content that the new string contains. I've tried with all the syntax that bash allows (cause I'm new at bash) but it is just not working like I expected. It looks like the second <code>if</code> doesn't work, because I tried earlier without that and only print the strings (<code>echo $text</code>) and it worked, but not the proper way as the exercise I'm doing asks for. I have to show in the console only the pid and state of the processes that are running.</p>  <pre><code>cd cd /proc run="State: S (sleeping)" for i in $( ls -d */);  do     cd $i     if [ -f /proc/$i/status ];         then    text="`grep -w "S" status`"              if [ "$text" == "$run" ]                 then grep -w "Pid" status                      grep -w "State" status              fi              cd /proc         else cd /proc     fi done ;; </code></pre>
