<p>I have Fedora 22 installed on my laptop and wrote Lubuntu 14.04 to an 8GB usb drive as well as selected to install a boot loader on the USB. The first time I tried to boot to the USB it worked and I had all my boot options for the USB and my laptop. But, when I disconnected the laptop, I was left with the grub shell. So, in trying to fix this, I manually installed a boot loader to my main partition on my laptop which got the laptop booting working without the USB stick. But, now, the USB won't give me any boot options when it's connected. I have tried 3 different installs and even tried selecting to install the boot loader again on the USB and nothing is working. Is there not a way to have two boot loaders, one on the laptop and one on the usb? Would me manually installing grub2 to the laptop partition have any affect on the USB booting? Pleeeeease help.</p>
