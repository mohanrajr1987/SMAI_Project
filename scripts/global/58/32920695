<p>How can I use the set-guid bit vulnerability to execute a file <code>/bin/grade</code> which is owned by <code>root</code> using the following 3 vulnerable programs? I am not root so my access to the programs is limited to read &amp; execute only. For the file <code>/bin/grade</code>, I only have read access, but I want to execute it as root.</p>  <pre><code>-rwxr-sr-x 1 root bsp3    9673 Sep 25  2012 prog2 -rwxr-sr-x 1 root bsp4   10724 Sep 25  2012 prog3 -rwxr-sr-x 1 root bsp5    9557 Sep 25  2012 prog4 </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://pastebin.com/8hJqY7uM" rel="nofollow">Link to programs 2, 3 &amp; 4 source code on pastebin</a></p>
