<p>I need a shared directory /opt which can be access by all users. We have 10 users user1..user10. All these users share common secondary group 'alpha'. With following condition: /opt is owned by 'root:alpha'</p>  <blockquote>   <p>user1 owns a file '/opt/file1.txt'</p>      <ul>   <li>file1.txt can be deleted/renamed user1 but not others.</li>   <li>file1.txt can be read by all users.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>I have been messing up with chattr/chmod/chown/setfacl for couple of hrs now. still unable to find a solution.</p>  <p>thanks!</p>
