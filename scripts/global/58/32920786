<p>I have to write a script which performs remote login and authentication and execute a local script on remote.</p>  <p>My original code is like this:</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/expect spawn ssh user@ip "bash -ls" &lt; ./script.bash expect "password" send "abc123/r" interact </code></pre>  <p>which gives following on running by ./my_script.sh</p>  <pre><code>spawn ssh user@ip "bash -ls" &lt; ./script.bash user@ip's password: ./script.bash: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>However, if I run the script without argument i.e. just</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/expect spawn ssh user@ip expect "password" send "abc123/r" interact </code></pre>  <p>It gets successfully login.</p>  <p>Also if I run directly through terminal without script like</p>  <pre><code>ssh user@ip "bash -ls" &lt; ./script.bash </code></pre>  <p>then local file is getting executed successfully at remote server after taking password through prompt. Hence can you please suggest how to make my original code to work successfully.</p>
