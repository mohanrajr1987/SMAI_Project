<p>I want to get a list of pathnames of files, divided by one blank space, and the files are sorted based on creation time. I use </p>  <p>find $dir -type f -printf '%T+\t%p\n' | sort -n </p>  <p>to sort them, but the problem is, how can to delete all the time before the pathnames?</p>  <p>If I use</p>  <p>find $dir -printf '%p'</p>  <p>I can get a list of pathnames, but I don't know how to sort them...</p>  <p>THX!!!</p>
