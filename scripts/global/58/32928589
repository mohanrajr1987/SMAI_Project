<p>I am writting an application in C that will be ran in a terminal, and it would be handy but not necesary to use some of the less used unicode characters. From my experimentation, I have not had any trouble rendering them. However, I would not use any non ascii characters if it were a likely source of trouble in the future.</p>  <p>So, in short, can I count on just about any terminal or terminal emulator in the modern *nix world (mainly linux, freebsd, and osx) to properly render arbitrary utf-8 characters?</p>  <p>If I cannot make such an assumption, there are particular subsets of unicode characters defined for various purposes, so would some such subset at least be reliably rendered in any likely modern *nix terminal or terminal emulator?</p>  <p>NOTE: When I say arbitrary, I do mean arbitrary: any unicode characters. But for completeness of my question, I will note that I am primarily interested in arrows and mathematical characters, this link has lists of both: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_symbols" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_symbols</a>.</p>
