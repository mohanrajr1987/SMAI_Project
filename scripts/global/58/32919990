Eajjb erd installation is perfectly working when accessed via wget on the terminal of the system. But not able to access via the browser. All the access rule for inbound traffic have been set in the aws security group. I'm not able to figure out the problem that why the interface is not avalilable on browser.</p>  <pre><code>--2015-10-03 07:02:00--  http://iglimped.com:5280/admin/ </code></pre>  <p>Resolving iglimped.com (iglimped.com)... 52.74.228.147 Connecting to iglimped.com (iglimped.com)|52.74.228.147|:5280... connected.
