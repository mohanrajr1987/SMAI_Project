<p>I am a master student working with MonetDB for my thesis. I installed MonetDB and now I need to work with the DataCell extension to proceed. I am on Lubuntu 15.04 and started the MonetDB tutorial, however when I begin to work with the DataCell (<a href="https://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/Extensions/Streams" rel="nofollow">https://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/Extensions/Streams</a>), I keep finding errors.</p>  <p>For example, on the "set optimizer = 'datacell_pipe';" instruction, I get the error "optimizer 'datacell_pipe' unknown". I also tried the "sensor --host=localhost --port=50500 --events=1000 --columns=3 &amp; " command, which is not found. </p>  <p>I am using the July 2015 release, and I installed every package related to the MonetDB on Linux repositories.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
