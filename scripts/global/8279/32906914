<p>I am trying to deploy my meanjs 0.4 app to Heroku. I have gone through all the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git" rel="nofollow">procedure</a>. The app is deployed but when I go to the url (<em>myapp.herokuapp.com)</em>, i just see a blank page. When i run "heroku logs" command, from the logs, the rest seems ok apart from the following error;</p>  <pre><code>..... 2015-10-02T10:13:50.332401+00:00 app[web.1]: + Error: Certificate file or key file is missing, falling back to non-SSL mode  2015-10-02T10:13:50.337817+00:00 app[web.1]:  2015-10-02T10:13:50.183794+00:00 app[web.1]:  2015-10-02T10:13:50.332567+00:00 app[web.1]:   To create them, simply run the following from your shell: sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh ...... </code></pre>  <p>I have run sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh several times and nothing changes. I have <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command#uninstalling-the-heroku-cli" rel="nofollow">uninstalled heroku toolbelt</a> and re-installed it but the problem persists., How can I get over this error?</p>  <p>Previously, I also tried <a href="http://www.tilcode.com/deploying-a-mean-stack-app-to-heroku/" rel="nofollow">deploying an already existing git repo</a> (of the same app) to heroku, and the same problem persisted.</p>  <p>I am willing to provide more information if the question is not clear enough. </p>
