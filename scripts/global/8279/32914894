<p>Shows fine locally. But when I upload to Heroku, I get the following:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TNfnI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TNfnI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>&lt;%= image_tag('logo-red.png') %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and it's located in assets/images/</p>  <p>I'm not using Turbolinks. Do I need to run a command on Heroku to solve this or is there some config setting I'm missing?</p>
