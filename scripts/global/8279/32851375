<p>I'm trying to set up a virtual environment using Vagrant. I want to match my production PHP environment on Heroku. </p>  <p>I'm about to try to set up my own using <a href="https://puphpet.com/" rel="nofollow">puphpet</a> but I'm worried that I'll be "re-inventing the wheel" since Heroku has become such a popular hosting platform... I found several Heroku VirtualBoxes for <em>Ruby</em> development, but none of these have PHP installed:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/lazygray/boxes/heroku-cedar-14" rel="nofollow">https://atlas.hashicorp.com/lazygray/boxes/heroku-cedar-14</a></li> <li><p><a href="http://icebergist.com/posts/quick-virtualboxvagrant-setup-with-heroku-like-box/" rel="nofollow">http://icebergist.com/posts/quick-virtualboxvagrant-setup-with-heroku-like-box/</a></p>  <ol> <li>Is there an equivalent for PHP?</li> <li>If not, does it make sense for me to hack those to add PHP? [Tips welcome]</li> <li>Or am I better off rolling my own from scratch with Puphpet? [Tips welcome]</li> </ol></li> </ul>
