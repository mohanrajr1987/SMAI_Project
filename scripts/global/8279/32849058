<p>I am using the google analytics api. I am trying to create a .pem file from a .p12 like I did on my local machine. My first question is is it ok to put a .p12 file into github or for that mater .pem file from mile local machine into github so I can send it off to heroku? If not how do I get a .pem file from google analytics into heroku. And if so, I am currently .ignoring my local pem file and I am sending up the .p12 file. I am trying to create the .pem in production as I did locally and I am having some issues. The tutorials for heroku tells me to run this command to get the ssl add on</p>  <pre><code>heroku addons:create ssl:endpoint </code></pre>  <p>followed by this command:</p>  <pre><code>heroku certs:add key.p12 key.pem </code></pre>  <p>However in the last command I get this error.</p>  <pre><code>Resolving trust chain... failed !    No certificate given. </code></pre>
