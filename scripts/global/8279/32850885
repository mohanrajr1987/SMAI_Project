<p>I have a dyno on Heroku I use for one off jobs. I do not want it to "start". I added this in my Procfile:</p>  <pre><code>heroku scale web=0 </code></pre>  <p>However it still tries to start every few hours as my log show:</p>  <pre><code>=== web (Hobby): `npm start` web.1: crashed 2015/09/29 07:28:12 (~ 4h ago) </code></pre>  <p>How can I address this?  When I searched for the solution the above Procfile entry was suggested.</p>
