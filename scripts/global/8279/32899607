<p>I'm running an application on the free tier (created last month, so it's on a new dyno and not a traditional dyno), and want to add a rake task with Heroku Scheduler. I'm confused about the usage limitations/charges for this in particular, and the free tier in general.</p>  <p>From what I understand, Heroku calculates usage based on wall-clock time needed to run a task/process a request, and uses that to limit apps depending on the tier. If that is the case: How many dyno hours do I have per month on the free tier? And if I exceed those, will I be billed or will the task just not run/the request just not be processed? My account is verified (i.e., a credit card is attached).</p>
