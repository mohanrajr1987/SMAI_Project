<p>I have followed this article,</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.bigbinary.com/2014/04/27/deploy-jekyll-to-heroku.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.bigbinary.com/2014/04/27/deploy-jekyll-to-heroku.html</a></p>  <p>to try and get this Jekyll site,</p>  <p><a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/08/13/version-3-jekyll-documentation-theme-released/" rel="nofollow">http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/08/13/version-3-jekyll-documentation-theme-released/</a></p>  <p>running on Heroku from a GitHub repo.  The site works perfect locally, I can test with either,</p>  <p><code>bundle exec jekyll serve --watch</code></p>  <p>or</p>  <p><code>bundle exec jekyll build</code> &amp;&amp; <code>bundle exec thin start -p 8080 -V</code></p>  <p>both work.  Although I can't bind to port 80 locally, I'm not fussed about that at the moment.  Anyway, after deploying to Heroku the build log says everything worked fine but I cannot connect to the site.  It doesn't seem to be getting served.</p>  <p>This is the second article I have followed, both have resulted in the same behavior, the previous one I tried was this,</p>  <p><a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2014/09/24/jekyll-on-heroku" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamesward.com/2014/09/24/jekyll-on-heroku</a></p>  <p>but that one wouldn't work locally either.  Any ideas?</p>  <p>Nick.</p>
