<p>I had my cloudflare pointing to Heroku that then got code from github, then i removed heroku and in place put OpenShift, then after figuring out you cant auto-deploy from github to OpenShift, i removed it completely. but when i view the website from my .com domain i get an ssl error, even though cloudflare isnt pointing to openshift anymore, it randomly switches to openshift and github. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. ive tryed resetting my router, firefox, deleting sertificates. purging files on cloudflare, removing cloudflare. nothing.</p>
