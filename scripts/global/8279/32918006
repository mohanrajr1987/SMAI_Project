<p>I have a Google for Work account and I'm creating an e-mail address with my herokuapp domain (e.g. me@myapp.herokuapp.com). I have verified the domain by putting the meta tag in the header of my app. I can send e-mail through gmail from me@myapp.herokuapp.com but for some reason I can't receive e-mail. I'm curious what is causing the problem of the e-mail not going through. </p>  <p>If anyone has some insight, I would appreciate it. I know that it's possible to receive e-mail by using a custom domain in my heroku app, but I don't want to spend the money on a custom domain right now.</p>
