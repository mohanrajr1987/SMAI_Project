<p>I'm learning Ruby on Rails, and having lots of difficulty setting up. So I have created this new app, using '<code>rails new</code>' command. Modified a bit, and now on way to deploy it on heroku.</p>  <p>First try, it failed because heroku required the app to use postgresql rather than sqlite3, which was set as a default database. So I downloaded and installed postgresql, and here is the where the trouble began.</p>  <p>After installing the postgres, I set up the path. And then I was unable to run the app locally anymore.</p>  <p>In command, "<code>rails server</code>" command is not working anymore, showing all kinds of error not being able to load stuff.</p>  <p>It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>D:\ruby\appname&gt;rails server c:\RailsInstaller/Ruby2.1.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/pg-0.17.1-x86-mingw32/lib/pg.rb:10:in 'require': cannot load such file --2.1/pg_ext &lt;LoadError&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and another bunch of load error.</p>  <p>No need to mention deploying on heroku, it fails everytime. After installing postgresql, I can't use any database related commands as it says "<code>loaderror</code>" everywhere. I can't run the app locally, nor deploy on heroku.</p>  <p>How should I fix this database problem?</p>
