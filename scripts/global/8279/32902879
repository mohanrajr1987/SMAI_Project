<p>After MongoLab force-updated my database from version 2.6 to 3.0 application crashes with exception "not authorized for query on database_name.collection_name". My application is using Mongoid gem v4.0.0 which in turn uses mongo driver version 2.4 under the hood.</p>  <p>From what I gathered version 3.0 has some breaking changes, so I'm not quite sure what to do here. Is there a way to make mongoid work with mongo version 3.0? Any help or advise on this issue would be highly appreciated.</p>
