<p>I have created a simple Blog using Rails, it works fine in development environment but it is not working well in Production environment. I deployed my app in Heroku. The content is not showing in the production mode. Following is the code I used for the Categories/Index</p>  <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Categories&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;% @category.each do |cat|%&gt;     &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= link_to cat.title, {:action =&gt; 'show', :id =&gt; cat.id} %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;%end%&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Also when i go to developer tools in my browser only the heading Categories is showing and the li is not showing but in the development mode it is showing in the developer tools on my browser. I have no idea what to do. Thanks in advance.</p>
