<p>I have a vcontainer which is populated with a gtk_combo_box and several buttons i would like to clear the buttons only from within the vcontainer, I tried the following code:</p>  <pre><code>GList *vcontainer_children, *iter;   vcontainer_children = gtk_container_get_children(GTK_CONTAINER(container));   for(iter = vcontainer_children; iter != NULL; iter = g_list_next(iter))   {     if (gtk_button_get_label(iter));       gtk_widget_destroy(GTK_WIDGET(iter-&gt;data));   } </code></pre>  <p>the code clears all widgets in the vcontainer, one possibility would be to replace the if with a function that checks whether iter is a button or not, but I do not know how that is done</p>
