<p>I made an OpenCV program, which I'm trying to get into a GTK interface.</p>  <p>The amount of documentation on how to do it its kind of scarse, but I managed to get <a href="http://codethatmatters.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/how-to-display-opencv-video-in-gtk.html" rel="nofollow">a guide</a>.</p>  <p>After looking up some documentation and learning the basics of C++ multithreading, I managed to mostly understand the code, fix it, and adapt it to a <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8ddbb7c70b3769687d91" rel="nofollow">compilable example</a>.</p>  <p>The problem is that it seems capped. It wont get past 5FPS, even with the camera set to grab 30. The interface freezes until the next frame is displayed. Sometimes the frames get delayed but the time stamps stay correct (5 every second. Not one more, not one less).</p>  <p>In case you're wondering, there seems to be no cap in the CPU. The program takes no more than 1% of a core (stays at 0.xx%).</p>  <p>What can be the problem? In case there's any better guide to do what I want, I'd love to know.</p>  <p>Please note that the program is meant to display somewhere between 30 and 90 FPS. In case there's a better method to display in such conditions, please answer with it considered.</p>
