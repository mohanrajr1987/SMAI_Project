<p>I downloaded GitEye from <a href="http://www.collab.net/downloads/giteye" rel="nofollow">http://www.collab.net/downloads/giteye</a> and started it on my Linux Kubuntu 14.4. Then I selected my git project. This worked until I press on the "Git Files" register: GitEye crashes:</p>  <pre><code>$ ./GitEye Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=256m; support was removed in 8.0  (process:11473): Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library  (process:11473): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.

What can I do?</p>  <p><strong>BTW:</strong> Is this the right site or should I ask the question at Linux&amp;Unix or at askUbuntu?</p>
