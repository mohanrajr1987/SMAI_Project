<p>Whenever I try to plot a graph in python (using matplotlib library) or show an image (using matplotlib/opencv library) in my Ubuntu 14.04 terminal, i get this GTK-Message (Sometimes even if the code is running fine and plotting the image:</p>  <pre><code>Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "overlay-scrollbar" Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "unity-gtk-module" Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module" init done  opengl support available  </code></pre>  <p>I tried to download the above modules and tried solving this problem, but was not successful. </p>  <p>Please note that I am not looking for an alternative (like using some other library). It would be great if someone could explain why this problem occurs and how I can solve it. Thanks in advance!</p>
