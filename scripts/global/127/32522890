<p>I'm trying to set up GTK on Mac but keep getting errors while compiling my code. I'm new to Mac so don't have a lot of knowledge. I installed GTK using homebrew. The current version installed is GTK 2.24.28_2. While compiling the program I get the following errors:</p>  <pre><code>clang: error: no such file or directory: 'pkg-config --cflags gtk+2.24.28_2' clang: error: no such file or directory: 'pkg-config --libs gtk+2.24.28_2' </code></pre>
