<p>I'm new at GTK. I'm using Glade to make an interface and just want to insert objects (like buttons and others) into a container.  I've choosen <code>GtkFixed</code> so that all elements can be freely located and sized. The problem is that when i drag a button for example, the button apparently gets it size from the parent (in this case the container) and takes a square shape. Here's an image <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7NGk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7NGk.png" alt="Screen capture"></a></p>  <p>I want the button to take the standard size, just like a rectangule or something. What i'm i doing wrong? I've checked some options in the container but can't figure out the way. Thanks.</p>
