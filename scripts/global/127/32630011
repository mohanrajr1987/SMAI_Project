<p>Same C/C++ code was compiling successfully on 64-bit, while compiling on 32-bit machine (after updating makefile changes etc) it is giving following error:</p>  <pre><code>**'gtk_window_set_keep_above' undeclared** </code></pre>  <p>while checking headers for gtk, it was found that header file <code>gtkwindows.h</code> does not have this function causing the error.</p>  <p>Now my question is which GTK+ package to update for <code>gtk2-devel</code> package without impacting other packages?</p>  <p>Currently installed <code>gtk2-devel</code> package is <code>gtk2-devel-2.2.4-1</code>.</p>  <p>System Information: Linux Red Hat 3 (Taroon update 4).</p>
