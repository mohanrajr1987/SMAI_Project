<p>I'm trying to use gtk to check whether the monitor is plugged or not with the code below:</p>  <pre><code>import gtk, time window = gtk.Window() screen = window.get_screen()  while True:     print screen.get_monitor_plug_name(0)     time.sleep(1) </code></pre>  <p>The code shows my plug name 'DP-0' properly, but the problem is that it keeps showing 'DP-0' even I unplug the monitor cable during the while loop. However, it will show 'None' if I restart the code.</p>  <p>So I wonder if there is a way to refresh the plug name in gtk without restart the code. Thanks.</p>
