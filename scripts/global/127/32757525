<p>I'm trying to make a modal FileChooserDialog using PyGObject.</p>  <p>The example at <a href="https://github.com/sebp/PyGObject-Tutorial/blob/master/examples/filechooserdialog_example.py" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sebp/PyGObject-Tutorial/blob/master/examples/filechooserdialog_example.py</a> works as expected, except that when the file chooser dialog is shown, I can still use the main window (including clicking the button to open a second dialog).</p>  <p>I've tried adding <code>flags=Gtk.DialogFlags.MODAL</code> when creating the dialog (line 23), but that doesn't work.  I get no error, but I can still open a second dialog without closing the first one.</p>  <p>If I use a MessageDialog with the MODAL flag, it works exactly as expected.  But I need a file chooser.</p>  <p>Is there any quick solution or am I better off rolling my own Dialog that contains a FileChooser?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
