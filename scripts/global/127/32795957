<p>I want to set the font to be used by <strong>a particular</strong> Gtk+ 3 application. How can it be done?</p>  <p>I know I can set the font to be used by <strong>all</strong> Gtk+ 3 applications in the file <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/settings.ini</code>, but I do not know how the font can be set for only a specific application.</p>  <p>Edit: I am not developing the application. I just want to run it with a font size different from the current one set for the desktop.</p>
