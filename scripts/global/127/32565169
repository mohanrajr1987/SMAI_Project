<p>I am new here, so I did not want to bother you with little questions, it took me time, but until now I managed to google everything. I am a Delphi programmer, who switched to Linux, therefore to GTK2 Lazarus.</p>  <p>Now, I can't seem to find a way to make a hotkey work in Lazarus (Free Pascal, very similar to Delphi). There is no RegisterHotKey function in components. I searched all *.pas files. Even if I did register the hotkey, Lazarus does not seem to support messages. I don't know where to start.</p>  <p>EDIT: I need the global hotkey on Linux.</p>
