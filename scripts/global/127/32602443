<p>Here, In the Switch Case I am using some key events. </p>  <p>When I press <strong>0</strong> it directs to <strong>Case 0:</strong> and goes back to the MainWindow I have, by closing the second-one(Window2). And If I press <strong>1</strong> it directs to <strong>Case 1</strong> and so on respectively, where the operations will be  executed separatedly.</p>  <p>My key events:</p>  <pre><code>    g_printerr("%s\n", gdk_keyval_name (event-&gt;keyval));     keypressed=gdk_keyval_name (event-&gt;keyval);     printf("The KeyEvent is: %s\n", keypressed);          char ch[10];     sprintf(ch, "%s\n", keypressed);        printf("The NewKeyEvent is: %s\n", ch);     int holdch=atoi(ch); </code></pre>  <p>Switch Case:</p>  <pre><code>switch(holdch)          {               case 0:                    printf("Close Window2")               break;                  case 1:                    printf("Open Quadrant1");               break;               case 2:                    printf("Open Quadrant2");               break;               case 3:                    printf("Open Quadrant3");               break;               case 4:                    printf("Open Quadrant4");               break;            }         </code></pre>  <p>Now, I want to close the operations getting run from <strong>Case(1-4)</strong> when running and come back to the Second window from where it left before.</p>  <p>How to do this? Can another Cases be used inside <strong>Case(1-4)</strong>? This time I want to use key-buttons like <em>Esc</em> or <em>q</em> for that. Is it possible?</p>  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> </p>  <p><em>Case 0</em>-> Close the window where I am now and after this there is no chance of executing other cases. As Second Window is the Window containing 4 Quadrants.</p>  <p><em>Case(1-4)</em>-> All are executable but can be executed one at a time.</p>
