<p>I am trying to clear the selected folder from a GTK FileChooserButton. By default, the button shows (None) and I would like to have a way to reselect that. I have found a (I think hacky) way: by calling fcbButton.setCurrentFolder("NULL") the option to select (None) is available on the list but the button itself does not change to reflect that unless manually chosen. In addition, I would like to do this for a FileChooserButton that is in SELECT FOLDER mode as well as reset the selected file in one that is in OPEN FILE mode.</p>  <p>I have tried passing an empty string. For the one in mode SELECT FOLDER, it changes the selected folder to be the working directory. For the one in mode OPEN FILE it crashes.</p>  <p>I have tried passing in NULL. It crashes in both cases.</p>
