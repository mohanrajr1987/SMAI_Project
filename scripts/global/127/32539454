<p>I was trying to record video of all the monitors or a selection, so was wondering what to use for Linux.</p>  <p>The thoughts that came to mind were screenshot the screen a bunch but this probably isnt the right way to go about it.</p>  <p>I looked at the Cairo docs but can't find anyhting. On Windows I found DirectShow and OSX I found AVFoundation.</p>  <p>edit: i just came across something: <code>XvGetVideo</code> would this be an option?</p>
