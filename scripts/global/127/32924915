<p>As you know, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp" rel="nofollow">Devhelp</a> is an API documentation browser for GTK+ and GNOME. It by default have included reference for many GTK+ related libraries but it doesn't have <a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/" rel="nofollow">Gtkmm</a>, the C++ wrapper for GTK+, which has an <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/unstable/" rel="nofollow">online reference in gnome official reference website</a>.</p>  <p>I need to get an offline reference for Gtkmm so I can keep studying while not online. I read in the description of Murrayc web page that this can be added somehow, but that link and webpage seem to dead long ago.</p>  <p>So,is there a way to add this official library reference to my Devhelp app?</p>
