<p>I have a very minimalistic program and just can't figure out how to solve the following problem. First of all some code I use:</p>  <pre><code>Gtk.Clipboard clipboard = Gtk.Clipboard.Get(Gdk.Atom.Intern("CLIPBOARD", false)); clipboard.Text = url; </code></pre>  <p>The confusing part for me is that if i run this from Visual Studio it works as expected without any errors. However, if i run the executable from Windows (or Linux) directly, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>(process:12542): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_clipboard_get_for_display: assertion `display != NULL' failed </code></pre>  <p>After this error i get this exception:</p>  <pre><code>Unhandled Exception:  System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object   at monoTest.Program.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0 [ERROR] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object   at SeriesDownloader.Program.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0 </code></pre>  <p>Obviously the clipboard object seems to be null, however i have no idea why.</p>  <p>Can anyone explain me why i get this error when i run the application outside Visual Studio and how i get rid of it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advice.
