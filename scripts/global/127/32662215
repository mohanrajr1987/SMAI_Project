<p>Trying to setup GTK+ 3.0 on Codeblocks Win7. Having some trouble finding exactly how to do this.</p>  <p>The GTK website directs you to msys2. It seems there was once a direct download on the GTK site for an all-in-one Windows bundle that is no longer there.</p>  <p>Having followed the instructions, installed and updated msys2, I see no reference to GTK+, in the installed files or on the mysys website that GTK directs you to.</p>  <p>Its seems very linuxy in terms of being unnecessarily and stupidly unclear to do something that should be simple. Maybe im missing something but should it not be as simple as downloading a zipped folder, extracting and setting up paths?</p>  <p>At this rate id be faster learning C++ and going with Qt.</p>  <p>The question is in the title, I am amazed I am having to ask the question, it seems like one that google should have completely covered but everything I am finding is relating to a download that is no longer available on the GTK website. I can find no info regarding msys2 and GTK+ 3.0.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
