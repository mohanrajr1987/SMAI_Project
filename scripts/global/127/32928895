<p>I'm collaborating in a open-source game, T.E.G. (<a href="https://github.com/wfx/teg/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/wfx/teg/</a>)</p>  <p>The game is pretty old, so we need to port some parts. One of those parts are gtk2. I found this link <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/migrating.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/migrating.html</a> that explains how to port from gtk2 to gtk3.</p>  <p>The problem is that the game don't use gtk2 directly, instead use libgnomeui, and i can't found any example or resource who explain how to do this.</p>  <p>In the file client/gui-gnome/gui.c you can see the core of the gui. For example, i don't know how replace the GnomeClient object.</p>  <p>If anyone did a port like this, i will be grateful, because now i don't know how to start.</p>
