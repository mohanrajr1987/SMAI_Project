<p>I trying to learn GTK on my Mac OS X 10.11. I have successfully installed and can compile GTK. Although, I when I try to run the HelloWorld project, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>(process:20810): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library. Using the fallback 'C' locale. Dynamic session lookup supported but failed: launchd did not provide a socket path, verify that org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded!  (main:20810): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:  </code></pre>  <p>First, I have found out that the first warning was caused because the LANG environment variable was not set. Although, after setting it to <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>, the warning is still there. Second, I have found in some forums that running the following command should make the error disappear:</p>  <pre><code>launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist </code></pre>  <p>But I get the following output: <code>/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist: No such file or directory</code>.</p>  <p>I tried to install dbus via Homebrew and said that it was already installed. Why is this problem caused and how can I solve it?</p>
