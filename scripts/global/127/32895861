<p>I'm trying to create buttons based on the number of lines in a file, each button will print the line content here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>while (fgets(line, sizeof line, config) != NULL) {   GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_label (line+12);   gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (button), "clicked",GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (type),line);   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (container), button);   gtk_widget_show_all (container); }  void type(char *string) {   printf("the line contents are %s\n",string); } </code></pre>  <p>all I get is the line contents are </p>  <p>I suspect this is because I am connecting the signal with different arguments to the same button(button name does not change :()</p>  <p>I need to keep this dynamic, the file content changes alot, I neeed to create buttons based on the number of lines, and use those buttons to perform a function on the corresponding line.</p>  <p>thanks.</p>
