<p>In order to upload images to my server I need to post to a specific URL so that I can handle it on the back end. TinyMCE seems to provide support for such functionality, but it's not entirely clear or explicit about it.</p>  <p>I tried using JustBoil.Me to upload the image, but the way it's set up does not play nicely with my Laravel and URL setup.</p>  <p>Have any of you had to do this before?</p>  <p>I found this resource to be very helpful, but the lack of literature on this topic is shocking:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/blog/posts/direct-image-uploads-in-tinymce-4-42/" rel="nofollow">Direct Image Uploads in TinyMCE 4</a> (it would be amazing to see a PHP/Laravel server side code snippet on how to return something that TinyMCE can process)</li> </ul>
