<p><a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/api4:class.tinymce.Editor" rel="nofollow">The TinyMCE official documents</a> have various events that you can catch when working with the editor. </p>  <p>One such event that doesn't seem to come out of the box is the ability to catch the event after which an image is edited.</p>  <p>In my implementation of image uploading, a URL to the remote image is simply returned and then displayed as an image, but if the user modifies that image, it gets converted to a blob, when really I need to catch the edit event so that I can re-upload the edited image to the server in order to persist the changes. </p>  <p>How would one go about doing this? Of course you could perform the action on the submit event, but this caveat comes into play:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Local images can be uploaded to TinyMCE through the use of the new editor.uploadImages() function.  This functionality is handled asynchronously, meaning that it is possible for users to save their content before all images have completed uploading.  If this occurs, no server path to the remote image will be available and the images will be stored as Base64.</p>      <p>To avoid this situation, it is recommended that the editor.uploadImages() function be executed prior to submitting the editor contents to the server. Once all images have been uploaded, a success callback can be utilized to execute code.  This success callback can be used to save the editor's content to the server through a POST, again helping to prevent the above situation.</p> </blockquote>
