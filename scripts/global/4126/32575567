<p>I'm using wp_editor() on the front end of a site that has tinyMCE advanced installed. It seems no matter how much configuration I do, I can't get certain buttons to show up, like link, unlink, background color, horizontal rule, among others.</p>  <p>Is there some reason why certain tinyMCE controls are excluded for wp_editor()? Or is this a bug? Or am I doing something wrong.</p>  <p>Yours truly, "Really Tired of This Stupid Problem"</p>
