<p>I'm using tinymce wysiwyg editor to let people comment certain things, and I also want them to be able to quote each other messages in a simple way. It's hard for me to explain but I'll do my best.</p>  <p>I have an url that looks like <code>article.php?id=1&amp;replycomment=1</code> and what it does it that it shows the article from the databse with ID 1 and let you comment the comment in the database with the ID 1. What I want it to do when I go to that link is that it would add <code>&lt;blockquotes&gt;</code> around the comment you want to reply to, inside of the tinymce wysiwyg. I shouldn't have to tell people to add blockquotes manually... it doesn't seem right.</p>
