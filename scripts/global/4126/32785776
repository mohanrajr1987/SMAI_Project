<p>Internet Explorer is giving layout to my DIVs in TinyMCE. This means that when a user starts editing all the text in the div is selected, rather than the cursor being inserted in the desired position, and it has editable drag handles:</p>  <p>Screenshot: <a href="http://puu.sh/knI67/c5c7250e56.png" rel="nofollow">http://puu.sh/knI67/c5c7250e56.png</a></p>  <p>Can I add some JQuery to my page, or to the TinyMCE init() to move the cursor to the desired position when the user clicks inside the div?</p>  <p>It's fine in Chrome, Firefox. Latest version of Tiny MCE.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
