<p>I am using tinyMCE to upload files to the server, the files actually exists physically on a folder called source, and I see on the popup all files, but I am unable to select any of them to insert into the text area.</p>  <p>I am doubting something wrong might be with my root path, not quite sure. If you have had such problem before please you are more than welcome to help me!</p>  <p>my config looks like:</p>  <pre><code>$root = realpath($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]) . "/venture/html"; $base_url="http://localhost:81/venture/html/";  $upload_dir = '/includes/js/lib/tinymce/source/';  $current_path = '../../../../source/'; </code></pre>
