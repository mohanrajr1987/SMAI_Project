<p>I'm using TinyMCE 4.1.5 and I'm trying to do some Jquery in a change event. I can't seem to be able to do any traversal of the dom from within the event declaration. Is there some trick to this?</p>  <p>My editor declaration has a bunch of stuff in it but this is the event declaration:</p>  <pre><code>setup: function (editor) {     editor.on("change", function(e)     {         console.log($(editor).parents("#testID").attr("id"));     } } </code></pre>  <p>It doesn't seem to be able to target ANYTHING using JQuery...</p>
