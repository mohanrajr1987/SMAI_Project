<p>I'm having a problem with what seems to be a feature of tinymce (but I can't find documentation on it). When I type '#foo', follow by a newline it creates a h1 with the text 'foo'. I discovered that when I use 2 hashtags it creates an h2, 3 hashtags and h3, ...</p>  <p>The problem is I'm using keywords like '#foo#' to be replaced by certain values, and now these are getting replaced by h1 accidentally.</p>  <p>Anyone got a clue on how I can stop tinymce from doing this?</p>
