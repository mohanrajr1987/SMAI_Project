<p>I have a site with some WYSIWYG-fields (using TinyMCE with Wordpress &amp; Advanced Custom Fields). I want to select and manipulate some elements inside these fields (add a background image) but I'm not sure how to do that. </p>  <p>How can I reach inside TinyMCE's iFrame and modify elements? How can I make sure all WYSIWYG-fields are properly loaded before I select them?</p>  <p>I'm looking at TinyMCE 4 API, and I still have no clue.</p>
