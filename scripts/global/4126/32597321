<p>I want to upload images to my server through TinyMCE and then return a response back to TinyMCE that it can therefore process and use to display the uploaded image.</p>  <p>Using this <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/blog/posts/direct-image-uploads-in-tinymce-4-42/" rel="nofollow">guide</a>, I was able to create the upload form, and then I also set all the routing and controlling on the back end. Now I'm just not sure what to return as a response so that TinyMCE can take the image and insert it within the text editor.</p>  <p>A PHP or Laravel code snippet would be extremely helpful. So far everything I've tried just redirects to a new page, but that's not what I want -- I want to pass some kind of code that TinyMCE can use.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>For Laravel, I found <a href="https://github.com/klogue214/tinyMCE-image-upload-plugin-for-laravel" rel="nofollow">this repository</a> which was extremely helpful. In the source,it shows what needs to be returned back to the view, and it shows how to call the function on TinyMCE to insert the returned image.</p>
