<p>We followed the instructions on this tutorial but for some reason, the upload button (the search folder icon next to the image URL) on the image dialog does not show:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Handling_Asynchronous_Image_Uploads" rel="nofollow">http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Handling_Asynchronous_Image_Uploads</a></p>  <p>We've tried with just the <code>images_upload_url</code> option as well as all the options, but the upload icon never shows:</p>  <pre><code>tinymce.init({     ...     images_upload_url: "postAcceptor.php",     images_upload_base_path: "/some/basepath", //optional     images_upload_credentials: true //optional }); </code></pre>  <p>The articles suggest that all you really need is specify the <code>images_upload_url</code> and TinyMCE will allow image uploads. </p>  <p>We are running 4.2.5. This feature is available since 4.2.0. I've confirmed with TinyMCE parent company (Ephox) that the image upload feature is a community version feature. So has anyone gotten this to work?</p>
