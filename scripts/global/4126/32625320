<p>I can't get a basic tinymce call to work in browserify, even though it works perfectly if I just load tinymce from a CDN. Here's a minimal example of what I'm trying to do.</p>  <pre><code>// main.js var tinymceConverter = require('./modules/tinymce-converter');  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {     tinymceConverter.init(); }  // tinymce-converter.js 'use strict';  var tinymce = require('tinymce/tinymce');  module.exports = {     init: function () {         tinymce.init({             // some params         });     } }; </code></pre>  <p>However, I get the <code>Uncaught TypeError: tinymce.init is not a function</code> error from the js console.</p>  <p>I have tried various combinations of other <code>require</code> calls, some in combination with jQuery, which is used a lot in this project. (Hence a solution with jQuery would be welcome, although my first priority is to get it working at all.) Am I missing something obvious?</p>
