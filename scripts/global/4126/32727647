<p>I have a basic Silverstripe CMS install on my web server however when I log into the administration I get a 500 error for this file:</p>  <pre><code>Request         URL:http://sitename.com/framework/thirdparty/tinymce/tiny_mce_gzip.php?m=1426832960&amp;js=1&amp;plugins=table,emotions,paste,media,fullscreen,inlinepopups,advimagescale&amp;themes=advanced&amp;languages=en&amp;diskcache=true&amp;src=false Request Method: GET Status Code:    500 Internal Server Error </code></pre>  <p>I have done some research and I am not sure what could be causing this or how to go about addressing the issue, I have tried changing the permissions of the file in question and the directories housing it but still get no resolve.</p>  <p>The error log states:</p>  <pre><code>[Wed Sep 23 09:45:33 2015] [error] [client 000.00.000.000] SoftException in Application.cpp:256: File "/home/frontend/public_html/newss/framework/thirdparty/tinymce/tiny_mce_gzip.php" is writeable by group, referer: http://sitename.com/admin/pages </code></pre>  <p>TL;DR</p>  <pre><code>The file is writeable by group </code></pre>  <p>However when I check the permissions of this particular file I get:</p>  <pre><code>0755 </code></pre>  <p>I have tried 0777 and 0555 and get the same result.</p>  <p>This setup with no changes works locally and I am not sure the differences.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated. I don't know why but I feel like this is a PHP configuration issue but I'm not sure how to debug this either.</p>
