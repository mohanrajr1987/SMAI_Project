<p>I have a Plone 4.0.2 site out of the box. I havent customized the theme so its pretty vanilla. I have pages in the site and a couple PDF documents. I have a problem that when I;</p>  <ul> <li>edit a page via TinyMCE </li> <li>create some text, </li> <li>highlight that text</li> <li>choose "insert link" </li> <li>select the object I want to link to </li> <li>choose "insert"</li> </ul>  <p>The text I have selected is not blue or underlined. When I view the HTML the href is not there. This problem doesnt always occur but occurs most of the time. About 1 in 10 times the link will successfully stick. I cannot spot a pattern. Im not getting any obvious errors, Viewing the error_log doesn't reveal anything."Link using UID's" is turned ON. </p>  <p>Im at a bit of a loss not sure what else to try. I don't have the option of upgrading the site. Other versions of Plone that Ive tried do not have this problem.</p>  <p>Any thoughts or ideas?</p>  <p>thankyou, Brian</p>
