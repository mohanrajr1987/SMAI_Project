<p>I am the beginner in <strong>Symfony</strong>. I am trying to enable <strong>Tinymce</strong> for the textarea. I have installed <strong>stfalcon tinymce bundle</strong>. It works. Then I found the plugin <strong>Justboil</strong> to upload images for the <strong>tinymce</strong>. I have managed to configure it to upload images to the images folder. But when I am uploading images in tinymce they do not appear in the content. Image tag is added, the src points at <code>/images/name_of_the_image</code>  but it is not icluded.  I think the problem is with configuration of uploading in <code>config.php</code> of the justboil  . </p>  <pre><code>$config['img_path'] = '/images'; // Relative to domain name $config['upload_path'] = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $config['img_path']; // Physical path. [Usually works fine like this] </code></pre>  <p>I don't know what should I put here to make it possible for <code>img src=".............."</code> to include the image in the content through Tinymce.</p>
