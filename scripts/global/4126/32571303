<p>Currently I have the <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration:paste_data_images" rel="nofollow">paste_data_images</a> set to <code>true</code>, but when I paste various content from a Word document to the rich text field, the entire paste is treated as an image. Of course, when I set it to <code>false</code>, it pastes the text content properly and keeps the formatting, but then the images are NOT included. </p>  <p>Is there a way to have the best of both worlds? Appreciated.</p>
