<p>I am developing website by using ASP.net and My DB is MYSQL. I have page where I use a textbox (tinymce) for to get the HTML content and save it to DB. ( TO get the text as it is with the decorations ). I am saving that content in a varchar(6000) column.</p>  <p>Also I restricted user entering 6000 characters at the textbox.</p>  <p>But when user submit the form textbox have HTML content which exceeding my limit. </p>  <p>So if I increase my varchar column to Varchar 12000 and restrict users to 6000 at UI will it be a wise move? Will it fit if user enter several decorations to text?</p>  <p>Remember this column is frequently use column. Performance is highly matters.</p>
