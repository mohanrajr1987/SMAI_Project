<p>I have trouble with formatting code in here so I created code on pastebin (I'm sorry for that). I'm trying to make SWF for entire day now and can't seem to get it right. Could you please take a look at my config files. It seems that nothing really happens when event fires from form. Here is my config. : <a href="http://pastebin.com/f3TGTeDD" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/f3TGTeDD</a> .  </p>
