<p>I have just started learning Spring. In the next step, I would like to develop bigger web applications. Now I am wondering if I should start with  Spring Boot or Spring MVC. I have already read some stuff, but it is kinda confusing, because both look kinda very similar. So what are the differences between those two? </p>
