<p>We are working on a web application using Spring4 and Tomcat7.I am doing the database set up part first time so not sure about where to put the database confiuration part (datasource creation) in Spring context.xml or in tomcat context.xml What are the advantages of both these approaches and which is the better approach?  Also,Our application is communicating with only one database.</p>  <p>Please help me out.  </p>
