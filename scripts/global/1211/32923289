<p>I'm working in an web application in JSF that is intended to solve almost all bussiness logic in the DB, i.e. data validation, processing, etc, occurs mostly in Stored Procedures. Which framework is recomended for this kind of application? I was thinking in <a href="http://hibernate.org/orm/" rel="nofollow">Hibernate</a> but the very same documentation reads:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Hibernate may not be the best solution for data-centric applications that only use stored-procedures to implement the business logic in the database, it is most useful with object-oriented domain models and business logic in the Java-based middle-tier.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Hibernate's honesty is appreciated. So, I'm looking for <strong>a framework that simplyfies managing connections and calling to the DB, and helps to write a more maintainable code</strong>. I've read about <a href="http://spring.io/" rel="nofollow">Spring</a> but I don't know if it is the best suit for this.</p>  <p>Also, if there is any <strong>design pattern</strong> to apply using just the JDBC, will be useful for me.</p>  <p>Any help and/or suggestion is appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
