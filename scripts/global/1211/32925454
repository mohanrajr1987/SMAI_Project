<p>I am upgrading my Grails application from 2.3.8 to 3.0.4.</p>  <p>Previously I had:</p>  <pre><code>compile ":spring-security-core:2.0-RC2" compile ":spring-security-ui:1.0-RC1" </code></pre>  <p>I found there's a spring-security-core for Grails 3:</p>  <pre><code>compile "org.grails.plugins:spring-security-core:3.0.0.M1" </code></pre>  <p>Which I am using. I've also seen that <strong>some</strong> of spring-security-ui has moved into spring-security-appinfo from this link.</p>  <p><a href="http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-appinfo/guide/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-appinfo/guide/introduction.html</a></p>  <p>I am using the forgot password feature from UI that doesn't seem to be there in appinfo or anywhere else that I've seen.</p>  <p>Has this not been considered or implemented yet in Grails 3?</p>
