<p>I have to create an XML file using Java, Stax and Jaxb. The whole file is composed by one root element and many children elements.</p>  <p>The first part (root element and some of its children) is written using Stax. In particolar I've used the methods <em>setPrefix</em> and <em>writeNamespace</em> for the root element for sets all the namespaces that I'll use in it.</p>  <p>The second part I've to use Jaxb and the <em>marshal</em> method for writing other children elements. </p>  <p>My problem is that for these children I've repetition of some namespace that I've just defined in root element.</p>  <p>How can I avoid to writing any namespace just present into root element?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Fabio </p>
