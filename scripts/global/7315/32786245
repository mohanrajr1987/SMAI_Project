<p>I'm using java jaxb to unmarshal xml request via socket, before the actual xml   <code>?xml version="1.0"....</code> I receive these bytes</p>  <pre><code>00 00 01 F9 EF BB BF </code></pre>  <p>What are they, xml size, session id???... I think that the sender is using msxml4.</p>  <p>Futhermore, when I try to send response the sender expect this type of header (I can see that it truncs the first 7 bytes).</p>  <p>Hence, I need to add these bytes (knowing what they are), before sending the response. Is there any "normal" metodo using jaxb that can be used to add this header or do I need to do it manually. </p>  <p>Some keyword to help others in search: bytes, char before xml on socket stream using java serving .NET msxml service</p>  <p>Thanks for any reply</p>
