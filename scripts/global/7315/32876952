<p>I have a data model stored in the Maven repo as an XSD file. My goal is to create a jar with all the Java classes representing this model. I want to use maven and JAXB to do this. I know about the  maven-jaxb2-plugin (codehouse-mojo and java-net, not sure yet how they differ) but I don't see a way to use XSD from the maven dependency as an input. Do I have to write my own plugin to do this?</p>  <p>It doesn't have to be JAXB if there is a better tool to it.</p>
