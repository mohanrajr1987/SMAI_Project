<p>I have a Java program in which I am using JAXB to obtain attributes from an XML file. This is all functional. But now I want to modify and append these attributes.</p>  <p>For example: XML Attribute: "IMPORTANTNIFO001" What can I do, if I want to delete the 1 and add 2, so that the attribute will end up being "IMPORTANTINFO002".</p>  <p>Please note, that setting the value will not do; like this .setXmlAtt("IMPORTANTINFO002"). It needs to only modify certain items within the attribute.</p>  <p>It doesn't need to be changed in the XML file, if it can be changed only for the instance, it is quite OK.</p>  <p>I did hear something about reflection being useful for such things, although I am not advanced enough to work these things into my existing program yet. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
