<p>I have used a Java Maven Project where are JAXB Java objects created to generate XML files.</p>  <p>The project at the beginning was created with JDK 1.7 and the JAXB objects from XSD I have created with JDK 1.7 for JAXB version 2.2.11.</p>  <p>The object creation was with command line with JAXB command.</p>  <p>Everything works perfectly until the user (don’t know why) requested me to change the JDk version for this project from 1.7 to 1.6.  Now I’m facing a problem in generation process.</p>  <p>In package-info I have defined some namespaces to display in XML, but after version change the namespaces are not displaying and it replacing with ns2: for exampleinstead of correct namespase.</p>  <p>I’m not getting any error message and I don’t know how to fix it :(</p>  <p>Could you help me please?</p>  <p>Many Thanks in advance</p>
