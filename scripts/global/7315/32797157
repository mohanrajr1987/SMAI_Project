<p>I have a REST service that uses EclipseLink Moxy to output XML and JSON from JAXB annotated classes that look something like these:</p>  <pre><code>class Parent {     List&lt;Child&gt; children; }  class Child {     String key;     int value1;     int value2; } </code></pre>  <p>The key property is unique among the children and hence I would like to make it a key property on the resulting JSON as well for convenient JavaScript usage like this:</p>  <pre><code>{     children: {         "key1": {"value1":1, "value2":2},         "key2": {"value1":3, "value2":3}     } } </code></pre>  <p>As for the XML however, I don't want to use the key as an element name as I don't want dynamic element names but rather a well defined schema. Any XML processing would use XPath anyway, so that the child elements would be just as easy to select by attributes as by element names. So I would like it to look like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;parent&gt;     &lt;children&gt;         &lt;child key="key1" value1="1" value2="2" /&gt;         &lt;child key="key2" value1="3" value2="4" /&gt;     &lt;/children&gt; &lt;/parent&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I can use @XmlVariableNode to get one or the other but can I somehow get these both at the same time (with shared annotations) without resorting to alternative external bindings documents or other messy complex solutions?</p>
