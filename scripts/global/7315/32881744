<p>I have looked at below mentioned question:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26822077/java-jaxb-how-to-create-pojo-classes">Java JAXB how to create POJO classes</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26823002/java-jaxb-xml-pojo-classes">Java JAXB xml pojo classes</a></p>  <p>Here is what I want to do.</p>  <p>I want to use JAXB and create POJO Java classes <strong>at runtime</strong>. If I change my XML in future, I don't need to make change POJO Java class structure manually. I need to only restart whole Java Application and it will generate all classes <strong>at runtime without user input</strong></p>  <p><strong>FYI :-</strong> </p>  <ul> <li><p>using XJC is not helpful as i can not merge it into application.</p></li> <li><p>I have already automated whole business logic which is not affected by XML file.</p></li> </ul>
