<p>Trying to do some stuff with in Java but I run in problem when doing the constructor. My code : </p>  <p>Piece constructor</p>  <pre><code>public Piece(Chessboard chessboard, Position position, Color color, String name, char symbol) {     this.board = chessboard;     this.position = position;     this.color = color;     this.name = name;     this.symbol = symbol; } </code></pre>  <p>Bishop constructor (extends from Piece) :</p>  <pre><code>    public Bishop(Chessboard board, Position position, Color color) {         char symbole;         if(color.equals(Color.BLACK))              symbole = Symbol.BLACK_BISHOP.getCode();         else              symbole = Symbol.WHITE_BISHOP.getCode();     super(board, position, color, "Bishop", symbole); } </code></pre>  <p>When I'm trying to do it like this, I get an error on the super call : "super() must be first statement in constructor body".</p>  <p>The only fix I see would be to replace 'symbole' in the super() call by an expression which would get the correct symbol in function of <code>color</code> but I can't manage to do it?</p>  <p>My Symbol class is just an enum with a field <code>code</code> which represents the code of the chess piece. All pieces are stated like <code>COLOR_PIECE</code> example : <code>BLACK_BISHOP</code></p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>
