<p>I have 3 Classes, each with a method to create either a Textfield, Button or Textlabel. I have set up my program so that a Textfield prompts you for a name, which is then stored in the name1 String variable. I also use a Textlabel that has it's setText(name1), but when I run it, it is saying NullPointer. I did LOTS of testing and found that the problem lies in the constructor, since I believe the constructor does its thing at the beginning, and even if the variable name1 changes, it does not "update" or re-construct. How would I go about this?</p>  <p>The class:</p>  <pre><code>public class Textlabel {   int x;   int y;   String name;   String text;   int txtColor;   int txtSize;   String group;   Textlabel(int _x, int _y, String _name, String _text, int _txtColor, int _txtSize, String _group) {     x = _x;     y = _y;    name = _name;    text = _text;    txtColor = _txtColor;    txtSize = _txtSize;    group = _group;  } } </code></pre>  <p>Corresponding function to actually draw the Textlabel:</p>  <pre><code>void createTextLabel(int num) {   cp5.addTextlabel(tl[num].name)    .setFont(createFont("TradeGothic-Bold", tl[num].txtSize))     .setColor(tl[num].txtColor)      .setText(tl[num].text)       .setPosition(tl[num].x, tl[num].y)         .setGroup(tl[num].group); } </code></pre>  <p>The constructor:</p>  <pre><code>String name1;  Textlabel tl[] = { new Textlabel(255, 271, "Contact 1 Text", name1, #ffffff, 37, "g4"),    }; </code></pre>  <p>Another part of the code is for the Textfield and then controlEvent to store the text from Textfield into name1. Problem is that the constructor does its thing, so even if I in setup() do createTextLabel(0); or I wait until once the user inputted text, and then create it, it still does not update, I tested it by when I declare name1, giving it a value too, and it always showed the value.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated! Thanks!</p>
