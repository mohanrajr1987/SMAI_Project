<p>Just as the title say, I was wondering if it is programmatically possible to get to know the constructor that an enumeration item uses to be initialized, I think that if there is such mechanism it should be accessible by using reflection but I have not been able to find anything like that, to be more specific:</p>  <p><strong>What I have</strong></p>  <pre><code>enum AnEnum {      E1(1),     E1(1, 2);      int v;      AnEnum(int p1) {         v = p1;     }      AnEnum(int p1, int p2) {         v = p1 + p2;     }  }  </code></pre>  <p><strong>What I need</strong> is a mechanism to tell me whether the instance was initialized by using the one or the two argument constructor, and even better would be if I can get the parameters used to initialize it.</p>
