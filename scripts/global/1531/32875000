<p>I am not sure where to put my if statements because I get an error when in the constructor and I'm not sure where else to put them. </p>  <pre><code>import java.awt.Color;  /** * Create a class called GrowingDot. This will draw a circle on the screen * in a specified color. Every time it is drawn it will increase  * in size until it reaches a maximum size and then it will be reset * to its minimum size and start growing again. *  * The class will need 4 class variables. Declare 3 ints (the x, y location * of the circle and the size of the circle).  * The class will also need a Color variable to store the circle's color. *  * Create a Constructor that takes two ints and a Color object as  * parameters. These represent the x, y coordinates of the circle  * (in that order) and its color. Use the parameters to set the  * appropriate class variables. *  * If the x parameter is less than 0, set the class's variable to 0. * Otherwise, use the value of the parameter. The same should be done * with the y parameter. *  * If the Color object is null, set the class's variable to red. * Otherwise, use the value of the parameter. *  * For the size of the circle, it should start off at 5. *  * Create a getX method that returns an int and takes no parameters. This * should return the x coordinate of the circle. *  * Create a getY method that returns an int and takes no parameters. This * should return the y coordinate of the circle. *  * Create a getColor method that returns a Color and takes no parameters. * This should return the color of the circle. *  * Create a setPosition method that takes two int parameters (the x, y  * coordinates) and returns nothing. If the x parameter is greater than  * or equal to 0, update the class's variable to the parameter's value.  * Otherwise, do nothing. Do the same with the y parameter. *  * Create a display method that takes a Graphics object as its parameter and * returns nothing. Using the Graphics object draw a filled oval using  * the class's size variable for its dimensions and the Color variable  * for the color. Use the class's x, y variables as * the coordinates for the circle. *  * After the circle has been drawn, increase the size variable by 1. If the * new size is greater than 10, change it to 5.   *  * Make sure you format it and include the needed documentation. */  public class GrowingDot {      int x;     int y;     int location;     Color c;      public GrowingDot(int x1, int y1, Color color) {         x = x1;         y = y1;         c = color;          if (x1 &lt; 0) {             return x = 0;                 return x1;         }          if (y1 &lt; 0) {             return y = 0;                 return y1;         }          if (color = null) {             return c = red;                 return color;         }         }         } } </code></pre>
