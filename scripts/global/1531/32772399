<p>The title sums it up. I came across an odd discrepancy in backslash escaping between regular expression literals and constructor functions with <code>new RegExp()</code>, and I was curious about what's behind it.</p>  <p>I was trying to escape a parenthesis <code>(</code> inside a constructor, like so:</p>  <pre><code>var search = new RegExp('/(', 'g'); var result = "(test)".match(search); </code></pre>  <p>But this kept returning an error. The match worked fine inside a literal <code>/\(/g;</code>, but inside the constructor I ended up having to do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>search = new RegExp('\\(', 'g'); </code></pre>  <p>Can someone please explain to me why an escaping backslash requires an escaping backslash itself in a constructor, but not a literal?</p>
