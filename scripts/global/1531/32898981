<p>I have a main java file and an employee class. for the employee class I have 3 methods - a getName method which returns an employee name, a getSalary method which returns a salary, and a raiseSalary which raises the salary by a certain percent.</p>  <p>in my Main.java file, I made a constructor to initialize the values of the employee class, and when I attempt to printout these values, I get null and 0</p>  <pre><code>/**  * This class tests the Employee object.  *   */ public class Main {  /**  * Create an employee and test that the proper name has been created. Test  * the initial salary amount and then give the employee a raise. Then check  * to make sure the salary matches the raised salary.  *   public static void main(String[] args) {     Employee harry = new Employee("Hi", 1000.00);     System.out.println("Employee name:" + harry.getName());     System.out.println("Salaray: "+ harry.getSalary());      harry.raiseSalary(10); // Harry gets a 10% raise. } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>/**         * This class implements an employee which is a person with a name and a      salary.      *       */ public class Employee {</p>  <pre><code>private String employeeName; private double currentSalary;  public Employee(String employeeName, double currentSalary) {  }  // Accessors that are obvious and have no side effects don't have to have // any documentation unless you are creating a library to be used by other // people. public String getName() {      return employeeName;  }  public double getSalary() {      return currentSalary;  }  /**  * Raise the salary by the amount specified by the explicit argument.  *   */ public void raiseSalary(double byPercent) {      currentSalary = getSalary() * byPercent;  } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
