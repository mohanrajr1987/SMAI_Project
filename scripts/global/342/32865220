<p>I am learning about QUEUE implementation. I know how to implement Enqueue and Dequeue. I came across the term MIN-Dequeue (an abstract DS) today. I googled the exact term but couldn't find any links explaining what a MIN-DEQUEUE is, and the same in SO. Can anyone explain it to me how to design it?.</p>  <p><strong>My Idea:</strong> Extracting a minimum element from the queue = MIN-DEQUEUE. SO the minimum element must be at the front of the queue. So create a tree with minimum element at the top and so on. </p>  <p><strong>Quick Note:</strong> If this is a silly question please comment it so. I'll remove it.</p>
