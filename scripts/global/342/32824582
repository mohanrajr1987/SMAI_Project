<p>I'm researching about uninstallers and I was wondering if there was some sort of a queue to delete programs/files under Windows. Since you can't delete the running uninstaller, there has to be a way to either put the program somewhere that will delete it when possible or call another process to delete the said program. If you have any idea, feel free to share your knowledge! </p>
