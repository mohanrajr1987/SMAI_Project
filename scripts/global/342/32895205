<p>Imagine a simple dating app, which provides you a potential match every day. When users first sign up, the following happens -</p>  <ol> <li><p>They are sent an email - "Welcoming to the Dating app!"</p></li> <li><p>A custom matching job kicks off to find them a match for the day and sends them an email - "You have a match!"</p></li> </ol>  <p>If I choose to mass-enroll several thousand people, the job queue will be populated with several thousand jobs of both #1 and #2. It's important that they receive the email <em>first</em> before getting a match, since otherwise it makes for a confusing experience.</p>  <p>I have -</p>  <pre><code># config/sidekiq.rb :queues:   - high_priority   - default   - low_priority </code></pre>  <p>As per <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Advanced-Options" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, those queues should process in the listed order.</p>  <ol> <li><p>How does this prioritization work? Is the <em>entire</em> <code>high priority</code> queue drained before picking an item of the <code>default</code> or <code>low_priority</code> queues? Or is it just checked more often, still allowing some lower priority jobs to be processed at the same time?</p></li> <li><p>As a follow-up to #1, is there a way to ensure that <em>for a specific user</em>, they receive the welcome email before they receive their match email? The former will be in the <code>high_priority</code> queue and the latter in the <code>default</code> priority, but there's no guarantee either queue is in any particular order for users.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks!</p>
