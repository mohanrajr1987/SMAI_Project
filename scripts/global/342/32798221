<p>I've been doing a lot of queueing with a project that I'm working on (Queue:Work) . There are some jobs that works and some jobs that fails.</p>  <p>Symptoms: 1. The same jobs fails over and over 2. The jobs that fail  finishes and it executes completely 3. Jobs will be moved to the failed jobs table even before the jobs finishes, but the jobs do finish.</p>  <p>Any Ideas on what's going on?</p>
