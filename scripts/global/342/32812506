<p>Problem:</p>  <ol> <li><p>query1, query2, query3 are added to queue. Consumer starts consuming the added query's right away. Everything works fine.</p></li> <li><p>After queue is empty, same query's are added to queue again. For some reason consumer now hangs for some time (5-10 seconds) before it starts consuming the given query's.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Pseudo:</p>  <pre><code>from Queue import queue from Threading import thread  fifo = queue()  class Producer:      def produce_query(self, query):          global fifo          fifo.put(query)          if consumer.not_started():              consumer.start()  class Consumer(Thread):      def run(self):          global fifo          while True:               query = fifo.get(block=True)               self.execute(query) </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure if I have misunderstood something with the queue work principle. Do I need to notify the queue/consumer to make the consumer working right away somehow or what?</p>  <p>I'd appreciate the help!</p>
