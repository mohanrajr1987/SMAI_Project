<p>I am asked to write a link-based implementation of a queue that uses a circular linked chain of nodes to represent the elements in a queue. </p>  <p>Also to only use a single tail pointer like so: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hKhz6qP.jpg" rel="nofollow">Figure 14-3</a></p>  <p>The problem that I am facing is that I cannot connect the back node pointer to the first as I am only allowed to use a single tail pointer.</p>  <p>The class I am using:</p>  <pre><code>#include "Queue.h" #include "Node.h"  template&lt;class T&gt; class CircularLinkedQueue : public Queue&lt;T&gt; { private:     Node&lt;T&gt;* back;     int length; public:     CircularLinkedQueue();     virtual ~CircularLinkedQueue();      bool isEmpty() const;     bool enqueue(T* element);     T* dequeue();     T* peek() const; }; </code></pre>  <p>The code line I am having trouble with: </p>  <pre><code>back-&gt;setNext(??);     // How do I connect it to the front? </code></pre>  <p>Please help point me in the right direction, I've been searching around for something similar but I cannot find anything. Thank you!</p>
