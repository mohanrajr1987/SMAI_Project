<p>Basically, I have a REST API built with Pecan. It is receiving a POST message with an action to be performed. When it does determine the correct action, it is creating a task using Celery (which is using RabbitMQ as queuer, with <code>app = Celery('tasks',  backend='amqp', broker='amqp://celery:celery@localhost/celery')</code>. </p>  <p>When Celery receives the task, it starts processing it in the correct queue (I have 3 queues). While processing, all the details are saved (manually, with python code) into CouchDB, with an <code>active</code> status.</p>  <p>So far everything is fine. But what I want to achieve is that when I do <code>service &lt;celery_queue&gt; restart</code> (queues are daemonized), all the tasks that were saved into CouchDB with a (field called) status of <code>active</code> or <code>open</code> are automatically picked up and start processing.</p>  <p>I don't care the current status of them when the service was restarted, because all the code is idempotent so it can be started over again, what I need is that all objects in CouchDB with a status of <code>active</code> or <code>open</code> are grabbed from Celery after a service restart.</p>  <p>Do you know how this can be achieved? Thank you very much in advance!!</p>
