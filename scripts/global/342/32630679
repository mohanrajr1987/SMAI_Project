<p>I'm just wondering whether an delayed stream processing is possible with Kinesis streams? And is this delayed processing possible with Lambda functions?</p>  <p>I'd like to group several interactions of a user over 5 Minutes before closing his session and processing his data. Thus I would write all data of a session into one Kinesis stream partition.</p>  <p>For me right now it is a little bit unclear than Lambda functions are invoced to consume Kinesis streams and how i can adjust the stream consumtion?</p>  <p>Can I adjust stream consumtion by time / data-chunk limits?</p>  <p>Can the consumtion of kinesis partitions be delayed? E.g. wait at least 5 min before partitions are processed.</p>
