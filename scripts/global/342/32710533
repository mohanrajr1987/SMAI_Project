<p>I have two queues. One for which contains a byte array (<code>Queue&lt;byte[]&gt;</code>)  </p>  <p>and another queue which contains the <code>DateTime</code> of when each <code>byte[]</code> received.</p>  <p>What is the best way to sort both from the first time this <code>byte[]</code> received to the last?</p>
