<p>I am using vertx framework.</p>  <p>As we know we cant block the main loop and we willing to use Neo4j.</p>  <p>Nowadays neo4j support on prod only rest and no async support. That could block my main loop on vertx. </p>  <p>so ofoucse I can offload those sync requests to neo4j using vertx worker verticles - but I am expecting thousands of concurrents connections the reason why we choose veryx in first place. Each connection will trigger neo4j and I afraid that neo4j going to be the bottle neck here.</p>  <p>Currently I thought about Two ways:</p>  <pre><code>1. Finding a way how to use neo4j asynchronously 2. Send each request to a queue(kafka/etc..) and than send requests to neo4j. </code></pre>  <p>What you experts think would be best here?</p>  <p>Thanks, ray.</p>
