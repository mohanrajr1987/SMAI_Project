<p>I have supervisorctl managing some daemon queue workers with this configuration :</p>  <pre><code>[program:jobdownloader] process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)03d command=php /var/www/microservices/ppsatoms/artisan queue:work ppsjobdownloader --daemon --sleep=0 autostart=true autorestart=true user=root numprocs=50 redirect_stderr=true stdout_logfile=/mnt/@@sync/jobdownloader.log </code></pre>  <p>Sometimes some workers are like hanging (running but stop getting queue messages) and supervisorctl does not automatically restart them, so I have to monitor and manually restart them.</p>  <p>Is there something wrong with the configuration? What can I do to prevent this to happen in the future?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
