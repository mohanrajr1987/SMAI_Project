<p>I have an array that creates a conversation between two people where it 'flips' between the browser speaking and the browser listening.</p>  <p>Short version, how do I make <code>saySomething</code> queue </p>  <pre><code> for(var i=0; i &lt; speaks.length; i++) {      saySomething(speaks[i]);    // saySomething should wait for the previous loop to complete  } </code></pre>  <p>Long Version</p>  <pre><code>var speak = {}; var speaks = []; speak.utter = "What do they call a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris?" speak.speaker = true; speaks.push(speak);  var speak = {};  speak.utter = "They don't call it a quarter pounder with cheese?" speak.speaker = false; speak.time = 3;  // listen for 3 seconds speaks.push(speak);  var speak = {};  speak.utter = "They got the metric system. They call it a Royale with cheese" speak.speaker = true; speaks.push(speak);  for(var i=0; i &lt; speaks.length; i++) {    //foreach better?         var speak = speaks[i];         if(speak.speaker)               speakThePhrase(speak);    // uses SpeechSynthesisUtterance         else               listenAndCompare(speak);  // uses webkitSpeechRecognition         // don't attempt to speak while listening is happening and vice-versa     }  doSomethingElse();    don't process this till old the speaking/listening is done </code></pre>  <p>Originally I had a recursive loop shifting the array and doing much the same as the above but I think this way might be easier to control the queue. So either using <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.deferred/" rel="nofollow">jQuery deferred</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q" rel="nofollow">Javascript Q</a> how would I go about this?</p>
