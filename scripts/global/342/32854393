<p>I have an input file containing many strings and ints.</p>  <p>ex.</p>  <p>blah 40</p>  <p>hello 10</p>  <p>asdf 20</p>  <p>etc...</p>  <p>I have already read them into a queue to hold them. I need to take them out of the queue and add it into a priority queue whenever int i equals the ints in my data file.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far..</p>  <pre><code>for(int i = 0; i&lt;=50; i++) {     Object x = normalQueue.Dequeue();  //this makes x equal the line of the data file dequeued.     if(i == x.secondint) //secondint is the Objects method that gets the integer in the data file     {         PQueue.Insert(x); //Inserts x to PQueue if i = the second int in the data file     }     else     {         normalQueue.Enqueue(x); //adds x back to queue1         normalQueue.SwitchEnds(); //Swaps the 1st and last node     } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem I am having is it is only printing out 2 files of the data file.</p>
