<p>I am new to MYSQL. I thought there would be a way to modify the "LOAD DATA" statement but there doesn't seem to be any way to do that. Please let me know if I am wrong.</p>  <p>I am trying to move over the column name along with its corresponding datatype for some 100+ tables and want to find the most efficient way of going about this.  I do not need the data in the columns to be moved.</p>  <p>I am aware I could alter the table and to switch column names with something along the lines of: ALTER TABLE protocol CHANGE COLUMN ModifiedDatetime ModifiedDatetime AFTER noteCount;</p>  <ul> <li>before: ModifiedDatetime, NoteCount, DocumentCount  </li> <li>after: NoteCount, ModifiedDatetime, DocumentCount</li> </ul>  <p>That's not what I am trying to do What I want is it to look like the following:</p>  <ul> <li>before: ModifiedDatetime, NoteCount, DocumentCount</li> <li>after: EMPTYCOLUMN, ModifiedDatetime, NoteCount, DocumentCount</li> </ul>  <p>And then I plan on renaming that empty column and labeling it as a PrimaryKey Any help is appreciated!! Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong of my logic I am new to MYSQL</p>
