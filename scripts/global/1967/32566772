<p>I have a big database with a lot of adresses, for exampte like this (here as json):</p>  <pre><code>{"id":"1","desc":"Frankie Johnnie &amp; Luigo Too","address":"939 W El Camino Real, Mountain View, CA","lat":"37.386337","lng":"-122.085823"} </code></pre>  <p>I get this data with a simple MySql - Statement:</p>  <pre><code>'Select * from datatable' </code></pre>  <p>And with the answer of this I create the json statements. The Problem is that <strong>every</strong> data get out of the table and when the database gets bigge, I think that the request takes some time. I don't have any idea how to better select the data. I Need all Data out of teh db to create a map.</p>  <p>Is there a better solution to create not so much traffic? Or is this request not so intensive and don't create so much traffic?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
