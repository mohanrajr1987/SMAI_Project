<p>Initially I have installed Apache Spark 1.2 and it works well with loading external files to create an RDD like sc.textFile("home/cloudera/inputs/log.txt"). Later when I installed Apache Spark-1.4.1, I am getting error"Invalid File path "home/cloudera/home/cloudera/inputs/log.txt"when my current working directory is home/cloudera.Can anybody assist in this issue.</p>  <p>With Regards</p>  <p>Gopinathtan K M</p>
