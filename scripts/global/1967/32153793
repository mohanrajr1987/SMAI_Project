<p>I have a stored procedure running in Firebird Database. Now I try to use this stored procedure to build a report in the SSRS 2012 (SSDT) Report Designer.</p>  <p>After I connect to the dataset, and when I choose the Query Type as 'Stored Procedure', and type the name of  my stored procedure, and then go to the Query Designer, and click ! (F5),   I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>TITLE: Microsoft SQL Server Report Designer ------------------------------  An error occurred while executing the query. ERROR [HY000] [ODBC Firebird Driver][Firebird]Dynamic SQL Error SQL error code = -104 Token unknown - line 1, column 1 [sproc name]   ------------------------------ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  ERROR [HY000] [ODBC Firebird Driver][Firebird]Dynamic SQL Error SQL error code = -104 Token unknown - line 1, column 1 [sproc name] (OdbcFb)  ------------------------------ BUTTONS:  OK ------------------------------ </code></pre>  <p>Any idea on how to resolve this? If its a T-SQL stored procedure, then it will be no issue; in this case, Firebird database connects to the SSRS via a 32-bit System ODBC connection.</p>  <p>When I proceed and click ok for everything, I get this error (after I exit the Query Designer), in the Dataset Properties tab:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not update a list of fields for the query. Verify that you can   connect to the data source and that your query syntax is correct.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The ODBC connection between SSRS and Firebird works fine. In fact I am able to run many queries as ad-hoc ones, but when I use the queries as stored procedure, then this issue pops up.</p>  <p>Any suggestion on how to handle Firebird stored procedures in SSRS will be greatly appreciated.</p>
