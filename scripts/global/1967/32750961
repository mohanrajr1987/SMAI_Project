<p>When using tsung to load test a file upload functionality, we keep getting what looks to be crashes (the slaves/clients sometimes just stops responding, some other times return a memory error). </p>  <p>We are trying to upload a 50MB file, with 60GB of RAM on our slave VMs.</p>  <p>We are running at a very low user rate (1 user per second and even there we get crashes and hangouts). We can see in the tsung.log that the slaves' memory is rapidly decreasing. Any advice or solution?</p>
