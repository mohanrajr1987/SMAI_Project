<p>When user upload a new image,our site resizes image and shows to user. <strong>The problem is this image will load only after many refresh!</strong> The strange point is after first image loading, this image would load properly (without any refresh) in next times(even in other browsers).</p>  <p>We uploaded site script on another server, it works properly. <strong>Our site developers say this problem relates to VPS server configuration.</strong></p>  <p>We are using Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP (LEMP) stack On CentOS 7.</p>
