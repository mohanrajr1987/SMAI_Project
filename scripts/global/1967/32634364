<p>I want PHP to execute links on my PC from just loading a webpage on my phone.</p>  <p>I have an app that automatically detects youtube/music links in sms texts sent to me and loads the body of the text into a webpage as a variable (%body), so people can text me with a link that they want played on my PC.</p>  <p><a href="http://localhost/openlink.php?link=http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/openlink.php?link=http://www.google.com</a> (or link=%body% from app)</p>  <p>openlink.php:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  //Show the value of the variable "link" (Shows it every time) echo htmlspecialchars($_GET['link']);   //Set $link  $link = $_GET['link'];  //Open firefox in attempt to run the webpage stored in "link" (attempts to open $link.com) exec(' "C:\Firefox\firefox.exe" "$link" '); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The above currently works fine apart from one thing... it doesn't load $link as the variable... each time it is sending firefox to load <a href="http://www">http://www</a>.$link.com/ instead of the text/link inside the variable</p>  <p>I've been searching around the net a lot however cannot find how I can get it to load the website that is in the variable</p>  <p>Could someone please help? Maybe I'm requiring code completely different in order to do this?</p>
