<p>How to get the load time of each and every single element present on webpage of a site.</p>  <p>For getting the page load time we can use this :</p>  <pre><code>long start = System.currentTimeMillis();  driver.get(urls[i]);  long finish = System.currentTimeMillis();  long totalTime = (finish - start)/1000;  </code></pre>  <p>But this is not a good idea to calculate load time of every image, css and js rather than we can use "<a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webpagetest.org/</a>".</p>  <p>So at last my question is how I can perform above task using selenium webdriver?</p>
