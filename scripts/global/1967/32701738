<p>I have n Endpoints behind an AWS Elastic Load Balancer, and I want to make a REST Call to everyone of those machines. If I make this call directly to the ELB, it will call just one of the machines. So my question is there a way yo make it? Maybe a specific AWS ELB Api that I can use, or some configuration I don't know. Before you suggest: I can not change the REST to anything else, I have no control over the application.</p>
