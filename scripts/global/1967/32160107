It sends you there whenever you beat a level and press continue, and whenever you press continue or new game at the main menu screen. There's an object that only instantiates on a node when the level is locked. I had it working before so when you'd complete level 1, the object wouldn't instantiate on the level 2 node (indicating that it was unlocked), and when you beat level 2, the object wouldn't instantiate on the level 3 node (again, indicating it was unlocked). I don't know what I did to it, but now it doesn't working and I've been stuck on this forever. Any help?</p>  <p>Another note, pressing new game clears the progress so only level 1 should be unlocked. Usually if I complete level 1, I could stop running the game, run it again from the main menu scene, and I would have the option to press continue at the main menu screen to send me to the world select screen with level 1 and 2 both unlocked. But now since for whatever reason, beating level one sends me back to the world select without taking away the object from the level 2 node, the "continue" prompt at the main menu scene never shows up to me anymore.</p>  <p>There are no compiler errors.</p>
