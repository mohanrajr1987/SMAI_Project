<p>I have a Play framework app in Scala. It uses database and I need to load data into database before first app start. I thought I could add a class with a main class in the app and start it like <code>play -main loadDataClass</code>. It seems to be working but once I access <code>Play.current.configuration</code> I need this to access database credentials. I get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: There is no started application</p> </blockquote>  <p>Please advice how to implement this. Should I somehow start the application?</p>
