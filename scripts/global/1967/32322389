<p>I noticed a strange behavior with one of my websites today. The first time my Android phone goes to the website I get a bunch of wingdings and nonsense on the page. If I reload the page it loads properly. Does anyone have any idea why that would be the case. Here is a picture of the issue.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m99MB.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m99MB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Phone Info VS985 4g Android 5.0.1</p>  <p>Website is: <a href="https://fyxtrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">https://fyxtrpg.com/</a></p>  <p>I recently hooked up this website with Cloudflare. Could that be the cause?</p>  <p>What is this called? I am having a very hard time searching for this. </p>  <p>Thank you for you help!</p>
