<p>I would like to measure loading time of a document in my testing web app. I have used JMeter for this, but I am getting different values for each run. I am measuring average time in the summary report.</p>  <p>I am not sure, that the value is proper or not.Is this approach is correct or is there any plugins are there for jmeter?</p>  <p>I have used HTTP watch to get rendering time, but I can't use that tool for more than 1 user (Load Testing). I am using JMeter 2.13. Could you please help me in this?</p>
