<p>My question is the following: I have an array list with string and I would like to convert it in Date. Seems 'parse' cannot be used to do this, within the following piece of code:</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; eventsList = Arrays.asList("2015-06-02 00:15", "2015-06-02 22:15", "2015-06-03 00:18"); List&lt;Date&gt; eventsDate = new SimpleDateFormat("y-M-d H:m").parse(eventsList); </code></pre>  <p>But that doesn't work.</p>  <p>Could you help me please?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
