<p>I have a method that passes in an arraylist of data and a printwriter to print my output into a csv file. The name of the arraylist is records.</p>  <pre><code>for (String record: records){  String[] recordSplit = record.split(",");  double value = Double.parseDouble(recordSplit[2]);   writer.println(record);  } </code></pre>  <p>As it iterates through the arraylist, the codes are supposed to print onto the csv file line by line. (String record) However, what I want to do is as it loops, I want to check for value that is less than 20 <code>value &lt;= 20</code> and the first value in the arraylist to fulfill that condition will have another column in the csv file output e.g. </p>  <pre><code>record += ",Start Value"; </code></pre>  <p>and then the iterator reaches the LAST value that fulfills the condition it will have an extra column like so:</p>  <pre><code>record += ",End Value"; </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDboI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDboI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I illustrated the concept in the image above. This is the arraylist, "id, name, value" there are some more attributes that are irrelevant to the question behind value so I'll leave it out. Anyways, value = 100 can be treated like a "forbidden value", so the moment when right before when the loop reaches the end of the arraylist, OR sees the value 100 again, that value will be assigned "End" value.  can this actually be done? i'm quite an amateur at java so please be kind, thanks!</p>  <p>Anyways, the output should look like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9AXY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9AXY.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
