<p>I have everything working but my unique() method. It removes 1 instance of 1 and 1 instance of 3, but there are 2 3's that need to be removed from the list. This will make more sense after you read further.</p>  <pre><code>[1,1,2,3,3,3,4] (Right here you print out the list) 0 (Checking the index of 1) -1 (Checking the index of 5) 6 (Checking the index of 4) [1,1,2,3,3,3,4] (use copy() method and print out new copied list) [4,3,3,3,2,1,1] (use reverse() method and print out array reversed) [4,3,2,1] (use removeDuplicates() method and remove duplicates) [1,2,3,4] (use unique() method and list unique elements) </code></pre>  <p>Right now my output is this:</p>  <pre><code>1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4,  0 -1 6 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4,  4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1,  4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4,  </code></pre>  <p>My methods are very sensible in my eyes, but for some reason ArrayList is making them not work. I'm very new to generics as well.</p>  <pre><code>    /**      * Return list of unique elements from this list. If the array is      * [1,1,2,2,1], [1,2] is returned.      */     public KWArrayList&lt;E&gt; unique() {          //Creating KWArrayList&lt;E&gt; array         KWArrayList&lt;E&gt; uniqueList = new KWArrayList&lt;E&gt;();          uniqueList = copy();          // first for loop to go through the copy of theData array called uniqueList         for (int i = 0; i &lt; uniqueList.size(); i++) {             //This loop will go through the rest of the array and remove what is not unique.             for (int j = i+1; j &lt; uniqueList.size(); j++) {                 //Creating 2 variables                  E v1 = get(i);                 E v2 = get(j);                 // Checks if they're duplicates, making them not unique. So we will remove them.                 if (v1.equals(v2)) {                     // Removes duplicates, leaving only the unique characters behind.                     uniqueList.remove(j);                 }             }         }         return uniqueList;     } </code></pre>  <p>I tried to be as descriptive as possible with my comments. Any help offered for the unique() method will be greatly appreciated. I've been sitting and staring at this code for hours trying to figure it out.</p>
