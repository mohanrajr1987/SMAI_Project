<p>I have my 2 activities set up and linked.</p>  <p>What I'm trying to do:</p>  <p>Take a generated text view in my first activity, convert it to a string, pass it to my other activity, where is it displayed in a list view with other previous passed text views. </p>  <p>So in my first activity I currently have:</p>  <pre><code>public void SaveMessage(View view) {     String saved = message.getText().toString();     Intent intent = new Intent(FirstActivity.this,SecondActivity.class);     intent.putExtra("message",message);     Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), R.string.addedfavs, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } </code></pre>  <p>However I don't really know where to go from this, I've looked at trying store the strings in arrays or then in array lists, but to no avail.</p>  <p>Help would be much appreciated on how to receive each string and store it in some sort of arraylist (as arrays are of fixed size) or any format that could consequently be displayed in a ListView.</p>
