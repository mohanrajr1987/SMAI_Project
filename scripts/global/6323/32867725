<p>So I'm c# developer and I'm learning javascript.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I noticed on C# the way to create an object is like this:</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>public class Member {     public string Name { get; set; }      public int Age { get; set; }      public string Sex { get; set; }      public Member (string _name, int _age, string _sex)     {         Name = _name;         Age = _age;         Sex = _sex;     } } </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>On javascript, I found just only one way to do it. Is so much   different, I didn't find another way:</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>var Member = {Name:"John", Age:65, Sex:"Male"}; </code></pre>  <p>So, the next doubt is I need to use it on a table. So I need an array of these objects 'Member'. </p>  <p>Normally, what would I do?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>C#</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>public ObservableCollection&lt;Member&gt; MyMembers = new ObservableCollection&lt;Member&gt;(){ new Member("Ryan",18,"Male"), new Member("Gabriel",51,"Male"), new Member("Samantha",14,"Female") }; </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>on Javascript?</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>var Member1 = {Name:"Ryan", Age:18, Sex:"Male"};  var Member2 = {Name:"Gabriel", Age:51, Sex:"Male"};  var Member3 = {Name:"Samantha", Age:14, Sex:"Female"};  var MyMembers = [Member1, Member2, Member3];  </code></pre>  <p>or </p>  <pre><code>var MyMembers = new Array(Member1, Member2, Member3); </code></pre>  <p>I'm on the right way, or I have some better option to do it? Remembering I will show it on a table. On C# ObservableCollection is the best choice.</p>
