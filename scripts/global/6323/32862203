<p>I have an arraylist of strings, called <code>ArrayList&lt;string&gt; records</code> that stores strings of data that will be delimited by commas <code>,</code>. At the [5] position of the string (after being delimited), will be a value between 0 to 500. An example of a string of that data is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>userA, 1418600437, 38.9047, 177.0164, washington, 180 </code></pre>  <p>so anyway, the arraylist will have many strings of similar data. What I need is to iterate through the arraylist (which is already sorted in the sequence I want), then find the FIRST value in the arraylist that fulfills the criteria that the number at position[5] is <code>&lt; 200</code> and then the LAST value of the arraylist that fulfills the same criteria. When the first value is detected, a String will be assigned to that one record to call it the "start" value and the same for the last value. Can anyone help me with the logic, or just a pseudocode of how that might work?</p>
