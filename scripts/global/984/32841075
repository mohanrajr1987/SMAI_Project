<p>I am currently working in google app engine. I was testing some feature in my local and suddenly some of the tables in my local datastore got deleted. Originally it had 20+ tables and now it is displaying only 6 tables. I thought my bin file got corrupted and tried to replace my current bin file with my back-up bin file. But, still it is showing only 6 tables instead of 20+. Any suggestions?</p>
