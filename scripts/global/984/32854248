<p>I am currently test-driving Google Container Engine (GKE) and Kubernetes as a possible replacement to AWS/ElasticBeanstalk deployment.  It was my understanding that just by the virtue of my dynamic servers being in the same project as the cloud sql instance, that they'd naturally be included in the firewall rules of that project.  However, this appears not to be the case.  My app servers and SQL server are in the same availability zone, and I have both ipv4 and ipv6 enabled on the sql server.</p>  <p>I don't want to statically assign IP Addresses to cluster members that are themselves ephemeral, so I'm looking for guidance on how I can properly enable SQL access to my docker-based app hosted inside GKE?  As a stopgap, I've added the ephemeral IPs of the container cluster nodes and that has enabled me to use CloudSQL but I'd really like to have a more seamless way of handling this if my nodes somehow get a new ip address.</p>
