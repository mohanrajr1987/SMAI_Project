<p>I am trying to upload a image and then redirect to another page when submit button is hit. But when i use back button in the browser and again upload the image, i get a <strong><em>404 Not Found The resource could not be found. No such upload session</em></strong></p>  <p>I have searched everywhere to resolve this issue but could not find any working any solution. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>class PhotoUploadHandler(blobstore_handlers.BlobstoreUploadHandler):     def post(self):         try:             upload = self.get_uploads()[0]             user_photo = Image(blob_key=upload.key())             user_photo.put()             self.redirect('/view_photo/%s' % upload.key())          except:             self.error(500)  class ViewPhotoHandler(Handler, blobstore_handlers.BlobstoreDownloadHandler):     def get(self, photo_key):         if not blobstore.get(photo_key):             self.error(404)         else:             image = images.get_serving_url(photo_key, size=None, crop=False, secure_url=None, filename=None, rpc=None)             self.render('edit.html', image_key=image)  class MainHandler(Handler):     def get(self):         upload_url = blobstore.create_upload_url('/upload_photo')         params = {'upload_url': upload_url,}         self.render('imagify.html', **params) </code></pre>  <p>The only way i could upload a image after going back is by reloading that page. What is the method of doing this without manually reloading the page? After looking everywhere it looks like it is a issue with blobstore. Please help.</p>
