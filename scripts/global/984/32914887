<p>I created a Google script that will be used for applicants to fill their information and upload a resume. </p>  <p>This will create a folder and upload their info as a Google doc and also put the uploaded file in the folder. It then adds the info to a spreadsheet and emails me all the info.</p>  <p>This works great for me currently, but I really would like to have it embedded on my site. The issue is that google scripts doesn't allow <code>iframe</code> embedding.</p>  <p>My question is either:</p>  <ol> <li>Is there a way to override the <code>iframe</code> blocking?</li> <li>Is there a way to write code to have a file uploaded to google drive in a  similar fashion that could be embedded on my site?</li> </ol>  <p>Here's a link to the most recent form: <a href="https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxn2mI-OzhkeQFltC679tpRB6b47C1leKNjwicmIuOn3EL71nfT/exec" rel="nofollow">My Active Google Script Form</a></p>
