<p>I'm trying to reduce my Google App Engine bill by setting the <code>automatic_scaling</code> parameters. In average, my app has between 7-10 instances running, where 2 or 3 of them are idle. But sometimes, like between 3 and 6am in the chart attached, the difference between active and idle instances is ridiculously large. Also, I want to reduce the number of active instances increasing the response time for the final user (setting <code>min_pending_latency</code> and <code>max_pending_latency</code>). But, until now, none of these settings are doing any effect.</p>  <p>This is my app.yaml configuration:</p>  <pre><code>automatic_scaling:   min_pending_latency: 250ms   max_pending_latency: 750ms   max_idle_instances: 2 </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k42C3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k42C3.png" alt="Instances"></a></p>
