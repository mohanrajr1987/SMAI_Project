<p>In my Google App Engine App, I have a large number of entities representing people.  At certain times, I want to process these entities, and it is really important that I have the most up to date data.  There are far too many to put them in the same entity group or do a cross-group transaction.</p>  <p>As a solution, I am considering storing a list of keys in Google Cloud Storage.  I actually use the person's email address as the key name so I can store a list of email addresses in a text file.</p>  <p>When I want to process all of the entities, I can do the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Read the file from Google Cloud Storage</li> <li>Iterate over the file in batches (say 100)</li> <li>Use <code>ndb.get_multi()</code> to get the entities (this will always give the most recent data)</li> <li>Process the entities</li> <li>Repeat with next batch until done</li> </ol>  <p>Are there any problems with this process or is there a better way to do it?</p>
