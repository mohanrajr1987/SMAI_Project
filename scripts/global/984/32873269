<p>I am developing a mobile web application: www.bazmo.com. When I test the site, the latency of the GET JS requests can get up to 30 seconds. It basically seems broken to the user.</p>  <p>Here is how I recreate the error:</p>  <ul> <li>Turn off cellular (wifi only)</li> <li>Clear History and Website Data</li> <li>Open safari and go to a page like www.bazmo.com/best/laptops</li> <li>Then click on the logo to go to the home page at which point it gets stuck for 30 seconds before the JS files load if they are not cached</li> </ul>  <p>I sometimes can catch it on Web Inspector and it just shows the JS not being loaded for 30 seconds.</p>  <p>What am I missing here.</p>  <p>I just use simple:  to insert the files in.</p>
