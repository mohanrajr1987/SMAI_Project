<p>I am trying to clone my project and since the "gcloud init <em>project-name</em>" is deprecated I followed the following steps.</p>  <p>1) "gcloud init" and entered the right options in the interactive menu.</p>  <p>2) "gcloud source repos clone default <em>local-directory-name</em>"</p>  <p>but it keeps asking me for user name and password. </p>  <p>I also executed  "gcloud auth login" and  "git config credential.helper gcloud.sh" commands</p>  <p>but still asks me for username and password.</p>
