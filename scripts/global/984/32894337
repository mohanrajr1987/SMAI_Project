<p>I was trying to find out the maximum count of list items that can be provided in ndb.IN query for equality comparison, but documentation does not state the same anywhere. </p>  <p>Here's What I am trying to implement? I have a list of users, which have some relation to the actual user. I also have a Feed items, which I want to be sorted in the terms of relation between the user and the Feed creator.  To do the same, I thought of 3 different types of queries:   1. Feeds which belong to users with direct relations   2. Feeds which belong to users with indirect relations   3. Feeds which belong to users with no relations.</p>  <p>I want to know if there's a better approach to do the same.</p>
