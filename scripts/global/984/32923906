<p>My use case involved 2 kinds, Customers and Orders.</p>  <p>From the docs I read that we can have descendants, the example shows persons as the kind. In my case I want a customer to have a bunch of orders underneath it. I want to try it out in the console before diving in but I can't seem to be able to set the customer as a key to the order. Any help?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6RRMk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6RRMk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This picture shows the Customer I have made. Note the id.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFivj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFivj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Here is the Order that I want as a descendant of the customer. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yHCc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yHCc.png" alt="Editing the order"></a></p>  <p>As you can see here I tried to put the customerID as a key, but the Ancestor path still points to the order itself.</p>  <p>Is this just a limitation of the console?</p>  <p>Also, if I try it in code, how can I refer to this specific datastore and namespace? I'm going to be doing this in java.</p>  <pre><code>DatastoreService datastore = DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService(); </code></pre>  <p>This looks like it's just making a new datastore.</p>
