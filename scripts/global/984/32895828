<p>I have searched through google, stackowerflow, and other sources too. But no luck so far.</p>  <p>I am developing an application with GAE java at backend and android at other end. Now server is setup on local machine, and it is being access by android via wifi using ip address.</p>  <p>when trying to upload the image, i first requested for uploadUrl which i am getting successfully. only issue i see there is that instead of pc ip address it is having the pc name. So for now i am replacing pc name to be ip address.</p>  <p>After when I actually try to post multypart image file, it is throwing exception <code>java.lang.IllegalStateException: Must call one of set*BlobStorage() first</code></p>  <p>Now I am not able pass this obstacle.  I have seen probable reasons for this 1. I am changing pc name to ip address - making link invalid altogather 2. as read somewhere this url's can be hit only once, but i am hitting it only once. 3. Dev environment is the problem, means only solution left is to deploy it?</p>  <p>Please help me out. Stuck badly with this. Thanks a lot in advance </p>
