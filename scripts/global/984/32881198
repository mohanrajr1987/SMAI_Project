<p>I am trying to use GCM CCS via XMPP protocol. I have been looking around for any documentation on whether it is supported on GAE or not. However not able to find anything good on it. </p>  <p>I found some links mentioning  that CCS XMPP is not allowed on GAE, which were posted before the latest GCM release. I am wondering if anything has changed with the latest release.</p>  <p>Appengine does have an XMPP api, but doesn't seem to have any reference other than using with something like Google Talk.</p>  <p>Anyone with any idea regarding this or any pointers, please help! </p>
