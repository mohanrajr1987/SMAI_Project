<p>During development of my Google App Engine Python application I have used following syntax to run it locally:</p>  <pre><code>gcloud preview app run module\app.yaml </code></pre>  <p>After upgrading Google Cloud SDK to 0.9.80 it says 'app run' command is <strong>deprecated</strong> and soon will be removed. Use dev_appserver.py instead.</p>  <p>I have tried to use dev_appserver.py:</p>  <pre><code>dev_appserver.py module\app.yaml </code></pre>  <p>But it wants to install some weird dependancies (PHP and Java support) of more than 100 MB in total:</p>  <pre><code>This action requires the installation of components: [app-engine-php, app-engine-java] gcloud app Java Extensions 1.9.26 | 96.5 MiB gcloud app PHP Extensions (Windows) 2015.08.17 | 18.9 MiB </code></pre>  <p>Is there some way to run Python-only GAE apps without installing PHP and Java components?</p>
