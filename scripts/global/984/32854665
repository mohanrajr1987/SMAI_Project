<p>I made an app and it is a bit CPU intesive. So I want to delegate some of the work to cloud computing.</p>  <p>Hypothetically, if my only source of revenue is Admob ads, will there ever be a situation where I am paying, say $200 a month more than I am getting from ad revenue, on a pay-as-you-go plan? Or will I need funding at first or something?</p>  <p>I'm using this -> "Google Compute Engine"; pricing: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing</a></p>  <p>Thank You.</p>
