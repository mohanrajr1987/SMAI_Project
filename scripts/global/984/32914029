<p>I inherited an appengine coursebuilder project a couple months ago, and we've been trying to upgrade to a more recent version of coursebuilder. In order to do this, the first step is to download local version of the course.  Whenever I run appcfg.py download_app -A $projectID -V $versionNumber ./folderToSaveTo</p>  <p>It downloads a different version of the course, one that looks like an old test version with old placeholder text, all links to lessons set to private, etc. </p>  <p>When I look at the versions of the course in the appengine dashboard, there is only a single version, so I'm not sure what it's even downloading.</p>  <p>Alternatively, it was suggested I use the ETL tool provided with coursebuilder to download the files instead, but that had a bunch of other issues associated with it as well. Previously I had asked the question directly on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/course-builder-forum/general-troubleshooting/5vzidyaepsk" rel="nofollow">coursebuilder forum</a> where the ETL tool was initially suggested.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help, -Tyler Nolan</p>
