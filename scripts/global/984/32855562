<p>Using the Google Apps Javascript Client library, I am trying to connect to the Reseller API but am having issues.</p>  <h1>Background</h1>  <p>I used the quickstart javascript from <a href="https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/quickstart/js" rel="nofollow">this</a> page as a template.  I then changed the client Id, scopes, etc to match the API I am calling.</p>  <h1>What I Want to Happen</h1>  <p>The user visits the page, clicks the login button and logs into a reseller account. Subscriptions show on page.</p>  <h1>What Happens</h1>  <p>If the user is logged into chrome as anyone other than the reseller account, the API tries to authenticate them using this account and does not give them the option to login using a different account.  This results in the login popup showing (it's blank though) for a quick second and disappearing then throwing an error saying that the user is not authenticated (API request returns a 403 error).</p>  <h1>Possible Solution</h1>  <p>If there was a way to ignore the chrome login or to force the popup to allow the user to login using a different account this would suffice.</p>  <p>Maybe there is a way to integrate an API for signing in to Google Accounts with the Reseller API?  Any information would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
