<p>I am trying to import several sql files to sql cloud database. The import action using gsutil is met with this exception</p>  <blockquote>   <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Cloud SDK>gcloud sql instances import   prova0 gs:// bucket_tmp/00005tickerwoeu.sql --database=prova0   Importing Cloud SQL instance...done. ERROR:   (gcloud.sql.instances.import) Operation   <a href="https://www.googleapis.com/sql/v1" rel="nofollow">https://www.googleapis.com/sql/v1</a>   beta3/projects/ivory-folder-123456/instances/prova0/operations</p>      <p>/89d123456-5b06-aec2-fb0ee65 is taking too long</p> </blockquote>  <p>While if I use the console.developers interface for import it does not work as it should. It claims to be running (and probably does as I see an increase of 30 mb in db size in one hour) or simply raises a </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"An unknown error occurred" error.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Background: I have a D1 database with 5 gb in it (the inserts in the mysqldump extend the bigger tables). The database was originally in MyISAM format, but I changed the two main tables to InnoDB (in sql-cloud db) after importing a dump raised a "mysql_query Incorrect key file for table './prova0/tickers.MYI'; try to repair it" error.</p>  <p>All the inserts are on the tables for which I changed the engine, and the problems importing start to happen after the change.</p>  <p>When I query the tables I seem to get the right output. But why are inserts no longer working/working at 500kb/min (they comprise varchar, integers and dates)?</p>
