<p>I have a total of 5 Play applications that I have been working on my spare time. They are small projects, serious enough to be published to the world yet not enough to invest large sums of money. I would anticipate a maximum of 10k visits per month, they are read only (information comes out of a database, nothing comes in).</p>  <p>What are some good inexpensive options to deploy these 5 websites? They will have 5 different domain names.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
