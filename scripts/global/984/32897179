<p>I have a bunch of entities in my google data store but I am having trouble printing them out. I am using java to try and access them. I have a custom search engine api looking at cnn page and storing keywords.</p>  <p>Here is an example of the way data store is organized.</p>  <pre><code>Name                    Content               Date 1443718097433           apple                 20151001 1443718097454           dog                   20151001 1443718097415           ran                   20151001 1443718097426           food                  20151001 1443718097495           source                20151001 1443718097410           chair                 20151001 1443718097444           listing               20151001 </code></pre>  <p>All I want to learn is how to print out each of the words under "content"</p>  <p>What is the easiest way in java to access a specific property of all entities and print them out?</p>
