<p>I'm currently working on a python-based app engine website and am looking to add google identity toolkit functionality but am getting stuck on the implementation of password resets and changes to email address..</p>  <p>Have been able to get the python quickstart example (<a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/toolkit/web/quickstart/python" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/identity/toolkit/web/quickstart/python</a>) working properly but even using this, I haven't been able to properly set up the password reset and email change components</p>  <p>I've been going through the google groups for this at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-identity-toolkit" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-identity-toolkit</a> but can't seem to be able to find detailed steps or sample code based off python</p>  <p>Would anybody have any ideas or can point me in the right direction? Much appreciated!</p>
