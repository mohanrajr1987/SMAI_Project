<p>I am trying to create an application where I host a few static html files that a user authors and uploads to GAE. </p>  <p>Is it possible to upload these files to WAR folder for hosting without a redeploy.</p>  <p>Uploading to WAR may not be a good idea as a redeploy would wipe out the user authored files. Would like these files to be stored across deployments. </p>  <p>May be a GCS bucket ? But in case of GCS bucket, how would you serve these static html files over a GAE/page.html url ?</p>  <p>I was reading that GCS bucket would serve as a web folder by turning a knob on that bucket. But how scalable would that be ? Is that even a good approach to use GCS bucket as a web url ?</p>  <p>Would be good to get some ideas on addressing this as I am new to GAE ! Thanks a lot</p>
