<p>I have a fairly simple ndb model that already exists has had instances created in the datastore.  It looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>class ExampleModel(ndb.Model):     property1 = ndb.StringProperty()     property2 = ndb.StringProperty() </code></pre>  <p>I want to add a <code>created</code> property to it, so that I can sort them by the time they were created.</p>  <pre><code>class ExampleModel(ndb.Model):     property1 = ndb.StringProperty()     property2 = ndb.StringProperty()     created = ndb.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True) </code></pre>  <p>When I do this, and try to query for the list of entities ordered by <code>created</code>, it only returns entities that have been created after updating the model definition.</p>  <pre><code>things = ExampleModel.query().order(ExampleModel.created).fetch() </code></pre>  <p>I have tried adding a default value to <code>created</code>, set to the epoch which is where I would like existing entities to be in the ordered list, but they still are not included in that ordered query.  Is there any way to include them, or do I need to migrate the existing entities and set their <code>created</code> property explicitly?</p>
