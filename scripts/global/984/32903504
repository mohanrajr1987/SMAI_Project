<p>I am not sure how to handle asynchronous operation in Google App Engine. Can you help me with this code?</p>  <p>I want to put asynchronously entity:</p>  <pre><code>class Thing(ndb.Model):   pass  entity = Thing() future = entity.put_async()  # hundred of code lines of other async to parallelize </code></pre>  <p>But I am not sure if I should wait on this put before handlers ends?</p>  <p>Should I finish my code with to keep data consistent?</p>  <pre><code>future.wait() </code></pre>  <p>Maybe my question looks trivial but I want avoid random bugs from unpredicted behavior. I read <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/futureclass" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/futureclass</a> but not found good answer here.</p>  <p>Same here <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/async" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/async</a>.</p>
