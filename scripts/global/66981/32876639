<p>To test some parts of code which require a fresh VM I use Vagrant. To automate testing I use <code>python-vagrant</code> package with which I automatically create and destroy VMs.</p>  <p>The problem is that I switched to Docker, so my app in now containerized and therefore I run tests inside a testing container. Even if I install Vagrant inside a container it complains that there is no VirtualBox around. Is there any possibility to solve this problem?</p>  <p>Right now I created a Makefile function which spins up a VM runs a container executing tests and destroys VM at the end. But that does not allow me to perform VM rollbacks between tests and so on.</p>
