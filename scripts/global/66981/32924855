<p>Our production servers setup is quite standard: API + WEB + DB servers.</p>  <p>The API is mainly the one to access the DB, but the WEB does that also in certain cases.</p>  <p>I want to create a similar local setup using Vagrant.</p>  <p><strong>This is where I got so far:</strong></p>  <p>I have 2 git projects, a WEB and an API. I turned them into Vagrant projects, by putting a Vagrantfile in both main directories.. each Vagrantfile points to a dedicated box which includes all the server dependencies.</p>  <p>Both VM's take the code from the mounted vagrant folder. So far - it works like a charm.</p>  <p>Now, i've got to the point where I need to create a VM for the DB, the thing is.. I obviosuly don't have DB git project - where do I put the Vagrantfile in this case? It's very convenient that the Vagrantfile is part of the code.</p>  <p>What are the best practices?</p>  <p>I hope my question makes sense.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
