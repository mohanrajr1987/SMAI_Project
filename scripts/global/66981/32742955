<p>I'm developing several apps using Ruby on Rails on Mac OS X Yosemite. My main deploying OS is Debian 8 x64.</p>  <p>I heard a lot about Vagrant. Should I use it? What advantages it gives me? Will it speed up my workflow or worse: slow it down?</p>  <p>Can I use it as a staging server for deploying?</p>
