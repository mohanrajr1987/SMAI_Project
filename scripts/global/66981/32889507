<p>I am using vagrant with virtualbox as provider. Within my guest system I have nginx installed and configured.  nginx is serving some static files from a folder and exposing them on port 80. That works fine. If I call <code>curl localhost</code> within the guest machine I get the answer I was supposed to receive.</p>  <p>I have a very simple vagrantfile, which you can see below. I forward port 80 to port 8080, but from the host machine I cant access that page via <code>localhost:8080</code>. </p>  <p>I already disabled the firewall in the guest machine without any success.</p>  <pre><code>Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|   # VirtualBox Settings: Give it a little bit more memory   config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "768"]   end    # Base Image: CentOS 7.0 x86_64   config.vm.box = "jayunit100/centos7"    # Use Vagrant's default insecure key (~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key)   config.ssh.insert_key = false    # Add port forwarding for node-inspector   config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080 # node-inspector    # Map project directory   config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/server/"    # Provisioning Shell Script   config.vm.provision :shell, :path =&gt; "vagrant-setup/base.sh" end </code></pre>  <p>If I call <code>curl -v 'http://localhost:8080'</code> from the host system I get told that the connection got refused. Any idea what I could do?</p>
