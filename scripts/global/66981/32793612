<p>I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a machine and am now configuring Vagrant using VirtualBox to allow some guest Ubuntu 14.04 instances.</p>  <p>After the vagrant nodes come up, I ssh into them and am trying to compile a C library. When I call make, it fails due to this particular error:</p>  <pre><code>ln: failed to create symbolic link '&lt;LIB_NAME&gt;.la': Protocol error </code></pre>  <p>Upon searching, I saw that there were many posts and complaints about this same issue occurring on Windows host. Even though my scenario is different, I used the suggestions and ended up running the following command:</p>  <pre><code>VBoxManage setextradata &lt;NODE_NAME&gt; VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/&lt;HOST-PATH-WHICH-IS-VAGRANT-ROOT&gt; 1 </code></pre>  <p>Running <code>getextradata</code> gives following output:</p>  <pre><code>$ VBoxManage getextradata &lt;NODE_NAME&gt; enumerate Key: VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/&lt;HOST-PATH-WHICH-IS-VAGRANT-ROOT&gt;, Value: 1 Key: VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/vagrant, Value: 1 Key: supported, Value: false </code></pre>  <p>According to those posts, the above solution should have worked for hosts which do not support symbolic links (like Windows). </p>  <p>However, this did not solve the issue for me (note that my host and guest are Ubuntu 14.04). How do I resolve this issue?</p>  <pre><code>$ vboxmanage --version 5.0.4r102546 </code></pre>
