<p>I have this <strong>VagrantFile</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|   # Use Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr 64-bit as our operating system   config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"    # Configurate the virtual machine to use 2GB of RAM   config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "2048"]   end    # Forward the Rails server default port to the host   config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 4200, host: 4200   config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 35729, host: 35729 </code></pre>  <p>Everything works good, in my Windows I can visit <code>http://localhost:4200</code> and it works. But, there is a big but.</p>  <p><strong>I have the ember's project files in a Windows folder shared with vagrant.</strong></p>  <p>If I save files of my ember's project in Windows I can't have livereload, and  in my <code>vagrant ssh</code> I even can't view the changes detected.</p>  <p>If I go with <code>vagrant ssh</code> and use <code>nano application.hbs</code> and then save something new it detect changes and livereload works in my Chrome's window on Windows.</p>  <p>What the hell is the problem?</p>
