<p>I realise that the Apigility UI requires write access to the /modules directory and /config directory.  My question is, what permissions does it require to the sub-directories that it creates?</p>  <p>In my case, it creates sub-directories (such as /module/myapi) with 755.  My web server user does not own the file structure or belong to the relevant group, so it can't write to the directories it has created.  I think that might be causing the errors I am getting.</p>  <p>Under normal circumstances I would just modify the users, groups and permissions to whatever I wanted.  In this case, however, I am using Vagrant and the permissions on my synched directories are under control of the host.</p>
