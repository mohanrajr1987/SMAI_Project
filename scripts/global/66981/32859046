<p>Trying to move my vagrant setup to a new laptop. I had moved over the ~/.vagrant.d folder and all the VirtualBox VM folders. At first, vagrant global-status seemed to recognize that vagrant is running and I can vagrant up and ssh into the VMs I moved over. But now when I do vagrant global-status, it says:  </p>  <pre><code>"There are no active Vagrant environments on this computer!"   </code></pre>  <p>Also, no vagrant machines are shown at all in Vagrant Manager even though a few of them are currently running.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
