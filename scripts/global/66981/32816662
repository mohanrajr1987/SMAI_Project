<p>I have been using Vagrant with an OS X host and a Ubuntu guest. It works fine except for permissions problems on the synched directories. So, my question is, is there an alternative solution that doesn't use synched directories?</p>  <p>I would like to continue using PhpStorm on OS X, and continue using Ubuntu server as my development environment. Is there a way I can connect to the Ubuntu guest and work effectively without the Vagrant share?</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I am using VirtualBox as the VM provider. The errors are something to the effect of:</p>  <ul> <li>Cannot fetch REST services</li> <li>Cannot fetch API authentication details</li> <li>Cannot fetch RPC services</li> </ul>
