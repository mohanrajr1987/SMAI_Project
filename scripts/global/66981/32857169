<p>right now I'm trying to send ipv6 messages from a linux VM deployed with vagrant, to a windows host. For someone reason when I send the message nothing appears in Wireshark, so I assume that I'm sending to the wrong address and start debugging.</p>  <p>So here's the most obvious symptom, I can't ping out of the machine and see it working. I was able to ping the host computer, but for some reason the pings don't appear in Wireshark. Here's an image of that happening, on the left is an ssh into the VM, and on the right the ipconfig of the host. In the background you can see what I'm capturing on and that packets are not showing. The VMs network is set up using Vagrants private_network option.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jPQOw.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jPQOw.jpg" alt="The problem"></a></p>  <p>So I guess there are a few parts to my question. Why aren't the pings appearing? What address should I send messages too?</p>
