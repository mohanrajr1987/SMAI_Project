<p>I am using a script to run <code>nohup vagrant up &amp;</code> on a new deployment, so the script does not wait for the VM to be up and continues to do its thing.<br> Main reason to that is a lot of I/O involved so provisioning takes a while to complete.</p>  <p>I would like to know if there is any way of telling the environment was provisioned properly without entering the VM?<br> Commands <code>vagrant status</code> and <code>vagrant global-status</code> tell me the VM is running but not if the provision is still running.</p>
