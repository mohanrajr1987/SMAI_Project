<p>I'm on a Windows host using Git Bash to run the <code>.sh</code> files.</p>  <hr>  <p>There are 4 components to my current project. To start up it on localhost, I have to:</p>  <ol> <li><code>webdriver-manager start</code> since I'm the QA and need that running anyway</li> <li><code>vagrant up</code> in the project's parent folder, then close out that window (or just start the VM myself via VirtualBox UI)</li> <li><code>vagrant ssh</code> <code>cd /vagrant</code> <code>cd "component's folder"</code> <code>docker-compose up</code> x 4</li> <li><code>grunt serve</code></li> </ol>  <p>Right now, I have a <code>.sh</code> file each for 1, 2, and 4, but I cannot find how to pass along multiple commands to vagrant ssh, especially since <code>docker-compose up</code> needs to be constantly running.</p>  <p>Is there a way to pass along those <code>cd</code>s and the docker-compose?</p>  <hr>  <p>I found <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/ssh.html" rel="nofollow">the ssh documentation from vagrant</a> which mentions something about needing to do fancy things to get it running background processes, but I have no idea what it's doing or how to implement that in a <code>.sh</code> file since the wording is so wishy-washy.</p>  <p>Also, I'm new to shell scripts in general, so if there's a smarter way to go about this to solve the issue, I'd appreciate it, too. These scripts aren't <em>necessary</em>, I just don't want to have to type it repeatedly every day when I'm running my tests locally.</p>
