<p>Current setup:</p>  <p>I have a project that builds with Vagrant/Chef (bunch of other tools, docker, bundler etc in play as well but this is the focus) Target is only Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.</p>  <p>1) Vagrant sets up a ubuntu VM runs Chef with Berkshelf and all the other Ruby build goodies.</p>  <p>2) Chef runs through all the cookbooks:</p>  <ul> <li><p>presumably download any missing dependencies via aptitude, install packages via dpkg</p></li> <li><p>pull/build source from git repos</p></li> <li><p>initialize databases, probably set permissions and create files etc</p></li> </ul>  <p>There are some tools such as <a href="https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby</a> that claim to effectively "freeze" a ruby application so you can ship it with an interpreter and all the dependencies/gems. This would be fine for a static application if not the last bit: running through cookbooks is actually an important step to deploying the application.</p>  <p>The deploy target will have no or limited bandwidth, is it possible to package a Chef build to locally contain all dependencies so that no remote download is necessary? </p>  <p>My idea so far is to run a clean build and make a copy of the chef cache folder and aptitude cache.</p>
