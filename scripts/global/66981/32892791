<p>I am using a virtual machine (ubuntu12.04) with Vagrant for development purposes. I had installed Apache, PHP and MySQL - which all originally worked. Now, MySQL seems to not work. </p>  <p>When I check the stasus by using <code>sudo service mysql status</code>:</p>  <pre><code>mysql stop/waiting. </code></pre>  <p>I tried to restart MySQL:</p>  <pre><code>stop: Unknown instance start: Job failed to start </code></pre>  <p>While trying to connect via <code>mysql -u root -p</code>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket   '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (111)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have gone through different questions related to this issue on this site but most solutions are referring to a memory space problem (which is not in my case).</p>
