<p>I'm trying to set up two VMs with Vagrant, and one of them needs to be able to ssh into the second one using the private key.</p>  <p>I defined both VMs inside one vagrantfile, started them up and then copied the private key from the .vagrant directory into my first VM. I was then able to ssh into the second VM without a password.</p>  <p>The problem is that this is not stable, Vagrant recycles this key each time I do <code>vagrant up</code> and creates a new one. This obviously breaks the ability to ssh from the first VM to the second one until I copy the private key again.</p>  <p>I don't particularly care which key exactly Vagrant uses, I just want it to be stable so that I can always ssh between my VMs. How can I do that?</p>
