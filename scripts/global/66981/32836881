<p>I am interested in frameworks that allow for testing the following:</p>  <ul> <li>One vagrant VM, running multiple containerised applications.</li> <li>A process to be run across these multiple containerised applications.</li> </ul>  <p>Then I would be interested in testing whether the lines of communication / the interface between adjacent containers in the flow was working.  Is there a good way of testing this sort of thing that doesn't use something like the e2e testing framework that ships with kubernetes?</p>
