<p>I'm running a PHP app on Heroku, and I have no issues retrieving environment variables with the <code>heroku:config</code> command, but I need to have separate variables locally.</p>  <p>I'm vagrant ssh-ing into Ubuntu, but for the life of me can't figure out where to actually set the variables. I've tried using <code>~/.bashrc</code>, as well as putting the variables in the provisioning script, but I can't get the <code>$_ENV</code> (or <code>getenv()</code>) function in PHP to actually retrieve the variable. When I call those functions I am told that the variables are not set in the environment.</p>  <p>Any ideas how to set environment variables in the local environment for a PHP Heroku app? </p>
