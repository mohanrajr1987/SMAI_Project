<p>Is it possible to install Laravel Framework withouth installing vagrant first?</p>  <p>I just read about vagrant and seems just great, however I think I will skip it for now. </p>  <p>I "installed" Laravel through composer, but when I tried to use the Laravel command:</p>  <p><code>new &lt;app-name&gt;</code> </p>  <p>The console outputs: </p>  <p><code>laravel command not found.</code> </p>  <p>I already set the <strong>~/.composer/vendor/bin</strong> route to the <code>$PATH</code></p>
