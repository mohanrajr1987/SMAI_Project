<p>I'm new to vagrant and aws.</p>  <p>I have a vagrant ubuntu image running in my laptop and I want to package it and deploy it into aws. How can I do this?</p>  <p>Here are what I have tried and found:</p>  <ol> <li>vagrant package --output NAME.box This gave me a ~1GB .box file</li> <li>Found <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws" rel="nofollow">vagrant-aws</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/tree/master/example_box" rel="nofollow">vagrant-aws/example_box</a> in github, but it seems to me that it can only deploy a dummy/new box into aws not a existing one? correct me if I was wrong here.</li> <li>Also tried a work-around: I deployed a brand-new ec2 with a amazon machine image (ubuntu) and I upload the NAME.box file into this machine. And I tried to install vagrant and virtual box and manually do the vagrant up. But it told me I can't do it on a xen virtual machine.</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
