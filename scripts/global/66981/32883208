<p>Ok, my first question in these forums! I'll do my best.</p>  <p>I'm trying to connect an Arduino Uno to VirtualBox v5.04 on COMx where the Arduino is a detected USB device (and the filter applied in the USB settings for the virtual machine). The problem I have is that when I attempt to start the guest OS (Ubuntu 14.04, same as host), I receive an error stating </p>  <p>"Ioctl failed for serial host device '/dev/ttyACM0' (VERR_DEV_IO_ERROR). The device will not work properly </p>  <p>ErrorID: DrvHostSerialFail Severity: Warning"</p>  <p>When the device is set to COM1 it eventually boots, though slowly (though much faster if on another com port). However, even when the device is eventually seen in the guest os, the Arduino IDE doesn't work (as expected I presume, given the warning). There are no blinking lights on the Arduino that suggest coms are occuring, for instance.</p>  <p>DMESG on the guest OS shows the Arduino as a recognized device. The Arduino IDE shows a connected device on /dev/ttyS1 (I believe I had com2 when I checked this). </p>  <p>My user in both the guest and host os (the guest OS is also a Vagrant box, if that is helpful) are members of the dialout group, if that is helpful.</p>  <p>Well, that's a start. If anyone has any notion, I'd gladly report any settings to help me troubleshoot this. Thanks in advance.</p>
