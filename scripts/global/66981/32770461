<p>I'm taking over the development of a php project using Laravel framework and beanstalkd driver for queuing jobs. This application was passed from a Mac development environment (that runs a beanstalkd driver) to a Windows 7 environment (beanstalkd not available for Windows machine -- at least not without cygwin tricks). So I've decided to use Vagrant homestead vm on VirtualBox that comes with an entire set of tools and servers including beanstalkd.</p>  <p>The application runs fine on my localhost until I try to send form data through POST header. I kept getting a "417 Expectation failed" HTTP error. I read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19872591/how-to-use-vagrant-in-a-proxy-enviroment">somewhere</a> that there maybe an issue with my proxy and could be fixed by disabling it. But as I see it, no proxy is used in my host machine -- I don't know about the guest (vm) though.</p>  <p>Could anyone help me solve this issue? Thanks.</p>
