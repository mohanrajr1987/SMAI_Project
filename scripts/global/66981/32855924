<p>The zulip setup requires having Vagrant setup. <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/zulip/zulip</a> But it fails in Ubuntu 14.04</p>  <pre><code>$vagrant plugin install vagrant-lxc Installing the 'vagrant-lxc' plugin. This can take a few minutes... Installed the plugin 'vagrant-lxc (1.2.1)'!   $vagrant up Failed to load the "vagrant-lxc" plugin. View logs for more details. Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider... There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix the following errors and try again: vm: * The box 'ubuntu/trusty64' could not be found. </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas what might be going wrong?</p>
