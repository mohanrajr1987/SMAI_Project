<p>I had a working assembly before updating to Windows 10, but now it's all busted and I don't know how to advance anymore.</p>  <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>  <p>Windows 10 - host</p>  <p>Ubuntu - quest</p>  <p>I've a Ubuntu 14.04 in a virtualbox, which is created with Puphpet and controlled with Vagrant. Ubuntu is a contained dev-environment and is sharing a directory with samba. I've one host only adapter with the static IP assigned for the virtual machine. Same settings are at ubuntu.</p>  <p>I'm able to connect to the virtualbox with vagrant ssh, but I think that it's using a port forwarding.</p>  <p>I've the newest versions of the Virtualbox &amp; Vagrant.</p>  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>  <p>I'm not able to find the virtual machine from the IP. The static IP can be pinged and connected Windows 10 host, but it seems to be referring back to my Windows 10, not to Ubuntu quest.</p>  <p>How in earth I'm able to gain the proper access to the box?</p>  <p>Yours -:H</p>
