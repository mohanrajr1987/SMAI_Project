<p>I am working on a project where I am creating rackspace cloud instances using Vagrant. I am using vagrant-rackspace plugin to do it. Everything works fine for me except the part that I need to capture the IP of the new rackspace instance created in the vagrantfile.</p>  <p>I need this IP address in order to add it to the Ansible inventory file (/etc/ansible/hosts)</p>  <p>Here is my Vagrantfile:</p>  <pre><code>Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|   config.ssh.private_key_path = "rackspace_rsa"   config.vm.provider :rackspace do |rs|     rs.username = "rackspace-user"     rs.api_key  = "a98weqrq3r34ewfadsf43rffa4697cc0036"     rs.admin_password = "Password1"     rs.flavor   = /1 GB Performance/     rs.image    = /Ubuntu 12.04/     rs.rackspace_region = :dfw     rs.server_name =  "ansible_server_1"     rs.public_key_path  = "rackspace_rsa.pub"   end end </code></pre>  <p>Once the instance is created I am going to provision the machine using Shell provisioning to install ansible. After installing ansible I will update the inventory file to reflect the IP of the newly created rackspace instance.</p>
