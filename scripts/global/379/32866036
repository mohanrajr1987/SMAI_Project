<p>I don't think there is a <em>good</em> way to do this... </p>  <p>but I have a vb.Net DLL which has an error handling method. Its <strong>good</strong>, and I want to use it in my C#.Net site.</p>  <p>So I add the vb.Net DLL to my C# project. </p>  <p>But wait! My vb.Net error handler method requires a '<strong>Microsoft.VisualBasic.ErrObject</strong>' ! </p>  <hr>  <p>Hmm.. is it possible to create such a data type in C#? Even by some type of conversion?</p>  <p>Or is this just ugly and should I forget about even trying something so outrageous and just restart the project in vb.Net? </p>  <p>*note that I am <strong>not</strong> going to change the required data type in the DLL</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
