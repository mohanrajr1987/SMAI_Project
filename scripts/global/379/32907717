<p>We often get very random URL requests to our app that, since these pages don't exist, result in us receiving a "page not found" error.  There are too many requests to list but here is a handful as an example:</p>  <ul> <li>discuzfiles.md5</li> <li>/data/admin/ver.txt</li> <li>/apply/_notes/dwsync.xml</li> <li>/data/index.html</li> <li>/plus/sitemap.html</li> <li>/mspace/default1/style.ini</li> <li>/static/js/admincp.js'</li> <li>/setup/license.html</li> <li>/data/admin/ver.txt'</li> </ul>  <p>Are theses requests malicious or just bots trying to identify/categories our app?  If they are malicious, is there anything we can do about them?</p>
