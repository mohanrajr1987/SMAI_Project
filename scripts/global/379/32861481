<p>Taking an intro course and need to create an over/under guessing game. I want to fine-tune my user inputs by creating an error if someone inputs a negative or non-integer. I have the non-integer error reporting correctly, and the negative loops back correctly, but the negative will not print my error message.</p>  <pre><code>#Number of plays def get_plays(msg):     while True:         try:             x = (int(input(msg)))          except ValueError:             print ("Integer numbers only please.")         except:             if x &lt;=0:                 print ("Positive numbers only please.")  i = get_plays("\nHow many times would you like to play?") print ("The game will play " +str(i)+" times.") </code></pre>  <p>Separately, if I wanted to use a similar setup to produce an error for any negative non-integer number between 1 and 20, how would this look?</p>
