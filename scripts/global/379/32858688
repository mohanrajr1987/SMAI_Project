<p>I am trying to have my program take a name as input from the user and then print out the initials of that name. i.e. tommy brown --> tb</p>  <p>What I have so far is this:</p>  <pre><code>int main (void) {  char scroll[100] = {"kang cheng junga"}; printf ("%c\n", *(scroll+2));  for (int i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {     if (*(scroll+i)=" ")     {         printf (*(scroll+i+1));     } } </code></pre>  <p>I keep getting this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>error: incompatible pointer to integer         conversion assigning to 'char' from 'char [2]'</p>      <p>[-Werror,-Wint-conversion]       if (*(scroll+i)=" ")</p>      <p>error: using the result of an assignment as a         condition without parentheses </p>      <p>[-Werror,-Wparentheses]       if (*(scroll+i)=" ")</p> </blockquote>  <p>Can anyone tell me how I've screwed this up? I am having a hard time understanding how * and &amp; function in a C. I am a beginner so I don't really know what I'm doing. </p>
