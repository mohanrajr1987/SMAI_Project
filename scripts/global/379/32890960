<p>Just started to write some DynamoDB and tried the batch operation</p>  <pre><code>var batchop = context.CreateBatchWrite&lt;HistoryEventModel&gt;(); for (int i=1;i&lt;=10;i++) {     var item = new ItemModel();     item.EventId = i;     item.something= "xxxx";     batchop.AddPutItem(item);  }  batchop.Execute(); </code></pre>  <p>Eh, but I can't help to notice that it seems there is no way to return failed items, so is there a way for me to get it? For example, hashkey is unique so assuming I've already got event_id = 3 in the DynamoDB, I shouldn't be able to store event_id=3 item again but the rest of the items should be fine. So I want to have a list of failed items.</p>
