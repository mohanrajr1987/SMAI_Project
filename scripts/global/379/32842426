<p>I am currently working on a ruby project which interacts with an API. If there is an error in the call the API hangs. I know this isnt the correct way to deal with such an issue but I would still like to know how you could return an error message if the API takes a certain period of time to return data. This would be an example of how I make a get call to the API.</p>  <pre><code>def get_call(routePath)   started_at = Time.now   enc_url = URI.encode("#{settings.abacus_service_endpoint}#{routePath}")   uri = URI.parse(enc_url)   http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)   req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri, get_header_for_abacus_service)        resp = http.request(req)   logger.bench 'SERVICE - GET', started_at, routePath   return resp if response_ok?(resp) end </code></pre>
