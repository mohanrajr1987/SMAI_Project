<p>I playing with Akka framework for Java, version 2.3.9 Everything is going fine, but have issue with callback. When I run for callback <code>getSender().tell(null, self());</code></p>  <p>I get in logs </p>  <pre><code>[akka://system/user/TowerOfDeath:Current:266:ceil:34] Message is null     akka.actor.InvalidMessageException: Message is null     at akka.pattern.PromiseActorRef.$bang(AskSupport.scala:266)     at akka.actor.ActorRef.tell(ActorRef.scala:123) </code></pre>  <p>It's fine, than I can't send null, made small generic message and problem solved.  But if that error happens, actor dies. I believe that sometimes possible produce bag, where I will send object, what is now null.</p>  <p>Hot to restore actor in that case?</p>  <p>Thanks for help.</p>
