<p>I do not see this question asked online so either it is really simple to do, or one should not be doing it.</p>  <p>My website makes a call to a pre-existing webservice to get some data. When the parameters supplied are not correct it throws a FaultException, and the message contained within tells me what the problem was. The webservice is legacy and it is not an option for me to change the contract.</p>  <p>Currently my website has the usual try/catch blocks and the FaultException ends up in the catch-all block where I can call</p>  <pre><code>catch (Exception ex) {     // Call ex.GetType() to see it is a FaultException     // If the exception contains "postcode was in a bad format" then add      // a specific error to the modelstate and return } </code></pre>  <p>I would much rather do</p>  <pre><code>catch (FaultException wsErr) {     // Code... } </code></pre>  <p>But the type or namespace is not found. I cannot find System.ServiceModel.xxx to add to my project references.</p>  <p>How do I include FaultException in my project? Should I even be doing this?</p>
