<p>I want to use output buffering with a callback function passed to <code>ob_start</code>. This works well as long as the callback function properly returns:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;? error_reporting(E_ALL);  function callback($html) {   # Fiddle around with the HTML. To keep the example simple, just return it as is   return $html; }  ob_start("callback"); ?&gt;  &lt;html&gt;   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;?=$foo?&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- PHP says `Undefined variable: foo', which is okay and desired --&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;  &lt;? ob_end_flush(); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In real life, my callback function is rather complicated, and I'm still developing and debugging it. However, if it fails in any way I get the message "Fatal error: Unknown: Cannot use output buffering in output buffering display handlers in Unknown on line 0."</p>  <p>If I add an error to <code>callback</code> like so,</p>  <pre><code>function callback($html) {   $foo-&gt;bar(); # Not declared, this will not work!   # Fiddle around with the HTML. To keep the example simple, just return it as is   return $html; } </code></pre>  <p>then PHP doesn't tell me <code>foo</code> or <code>foo-&gt;bar</code> is unknown, all I get is the message mentioned above. This makes debugging a tough, if not impossible job.</p>  <p>What do I have to do to see proper error messages? Change some PHP settings, install any handlers? I'm just learning PHP. It's running on a provider's server, so I don't have access to <code>php.ini</code>.</p>
