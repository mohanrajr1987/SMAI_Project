<p>So my understanding is that factories are singletons so any stateful data for a session would be ill placed here.</p>  <p>My next point of call was a service which returns a new instance of the service when injected however I am unsure how I would share one instance of the service to multiple controllers.</p>  <p>Is this an accepted way to solve this issue or does angular provide a better way?</p>  <p>My current use case is that I have a view with some partial views (each partial has it's own controller) and a modal window which takes in a row id and will display data dependant on that data.</p>  <p>I need to be able to share a instance of the service (or equivalent) across these controllers but on a per session basis.</p>  <p>How is this best done?</p>
