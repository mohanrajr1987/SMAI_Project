<p>I am making an website with client (make by laravel 5.1) interacting with an API (make by Dingo and Laravel 5.1 too). But i can't get the return value from session. I was tried everything i can but nothing good!, please you guys help me. I will very appreciated if anyone direct me to the way to solve this problem, this is my code i use to test the returned session.</p>  <pre><code>public function test(Request $request, $ucode){     $sessionToke =  $request-&gt;session()-&gt;all();      return  $sessionToke; } </code></pre>  <p>This is the code in client side which i use to get session value:</p>  <pre><code> public function checkState(Request $request, $ucode){     $params = ''.$ucode;     $action = 'test';     $result = ApiController::getAPI($params, $action);     return json_encode($result); } </code></pre>  <p>And the problem is when i try to get value directly from the api (in postman) everything is good but nothing show up when i try to call through the client side routes (even in ajax and postman).
