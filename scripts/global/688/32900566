<p>I am in my rails app and I am setting the value of the session in the child procedure in a controller method and then redirecting to a static page which finally redirects to my final controller/action method. Setting the session in the child procedure does not give me the value back in the final controller action which I land. I was using flash earlier but that din't work too so I decided to use session in my multiple resuests. Any ideas how to resolve this problem?</p>  <pre><code>child_proc = Proc.new do   session['ashish'] = "abbbbsb"   ....... end  fork do   sleep 1 #just giving enough time for the request to return    child_proc.call    exit #it will only exit the chld proc end </code></pre>
