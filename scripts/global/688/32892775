<p>I have an ASP.NET MVC application that is exhibiting some strange behavior... </p>  <p>Each page request gives me a new Session ID, I have tried everything that I can think of and its still not working.</p>  <p>The session is not empty, I am writing data to it on session start.</p>  <p>I have read the other questions on here and have checked:  1. All requests and coming from and going to the same domain.  2. The session is not empty.  3. The session is not being abandoned anywhere in the code.</p>  <p>I have used fiddler to confirm that the server is giving a new session ID on every request.</p>  <p>I have also checked the value of Session.IsNewSession and this is TRUE.</p>  <p>I must be missing something - if you have any idea what it might be I would really appreciate the help!</p>  <p>Fiddler output: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/21bo4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/21bo4.png" alt="Fiddler screen shot 1"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mrC2s.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mrC2s.png" alt="Fiddler screen shot 2"></a></p>
