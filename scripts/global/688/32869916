<p>I set the <code>gc_max_lifetime</code> setting in <code>php.ini</code> to 7 days in seconds yet for some reason it doesn't work, I logged in yesterday after setting up <code>php.ini</code> then came on today and I was logged out.</p>  <p>I see this option:</p>  <pre><code>Lifetime in seconds of cookie or, if 0, until browser is restarted. session.cookie_lifetime = 0; </code></pre>  <p>Should I mess with it and what does it mean exactly?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
