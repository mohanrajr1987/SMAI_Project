<p>I'm running GitLab on Centos 7. GitLab was installed using YUM. The initial gitlab version was 1.7.12.2.</p>  <p>The problem is with the WEB interface of the GitLab installation. I'm trying to get the browser session to timeout so that it forces you to login again after a certain period. I have noticed that a change request was implemented, so I upgraded from 1.7.12.2 to 1.7.14.3 using yum update. Under the Administration setting (in Web UI) I can now see the extra parameter where you can set the timeout. I have now changed it tt two minutes(for testing so I don't have to wait so long), but it simply does not work. I have also tried something bigger - 5 minutes - not working.</p>  <p>I have also done a gitlab-ctl stop, then gitlab-ctl reconfigure and then gitlab-ctl start. The new value still shows, but the browser session still does not timeout.</p>  <p>I have also created a new CentOS 7 installation from scratch, installed GitLab via yum with version 1.7.14.3 - this is as-is from the installation - so no previous upgrade problems or similar problems.</p>  <p>I have tried different browsers (FireFox and Chrome) on Windows 7/8, Even Mac. I have also cleared the browser cookies to make sure it gets the latest after the updates. No change in behavior.</p>  <p>Changing the time still has no effect....</p>  <p>Anybody with an idea what I'm doing wrong?</p>
