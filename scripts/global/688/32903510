<p>I want to ask . This may be a stupid question . I often play in wesbsite www.cliponyu.com And when I log on and get into a room on this website . I 'll get a free card love to give to the host . the problem is I have always required to log in and get into the room to receive love card free if not then I do not get a free card love . the question is how once I log out I still get love card is free. or in other words, I do not have to be online constantly to get the card love , because love card will always appear every 3-5 minutes jka us login and enter into one room hosts . Thank you</p>
