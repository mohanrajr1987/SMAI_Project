<p>Suppose I have one login form in php and I set session on <code>user_id</code> and <code>user_name</code>. Now, as per my php knowledge the default session timeout is 24mins, and suppose I'm using this application for whole day. Then obviously after each 24 mins my application will be logged out and I require to login again BUT still I'm able to use it continuously. HOW?</p>  <p>Dear friends don't laugh, I'm new in this. </p>
