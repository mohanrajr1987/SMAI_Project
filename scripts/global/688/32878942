<p>In my Vaadin application I have an issue when Vaadin does not invalidate session after "Session timeout" message. After getting this message users sometimes are able to click the link or refresh the page and continue working as if they are still being logged in. I use the following parameters: closeIdleSessions=true heartbeatInterval=true session-timeout=15</p>  <p>Last parameter (session-timeout) is also set in context.xml (session-timeout=900) and web.xml (session-config/session-timeout=15) as I didn't get clear from vaadin documentation, is there such a parameter for vaadin servlet or not.</p>  <p>Does anybody faced the titular problem?</p>
