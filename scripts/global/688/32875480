<p>I have a backbone marionette application that makes REST api calls.</p>  <p>In my model when i make a api call to login i get a session value back and see the cookie being set in the browser </p>  <p>immediately after when i make another call to get the user information that is logged in i receive a different session or cookie value and no user is found. CORS is enabled and options calls are being made. </p>  <p>When i hook up the api to my other applications that were build off non backbone libraries it works fine. Does anyone know how to solve this?</p>  <p>Here is my post</p>  <pre><code>         doLogin: function( data ){              this.fetch({                 data: JSON.stringify(data),                 type: 'POST',                 contentType: 'application/json',                   error:(function (e) {                     alert('error');                 })             });          }, </code></pre>
