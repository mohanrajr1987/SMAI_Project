<p>I'm using the awesome <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Flask framework</a> to create a website in which I use <a href="http://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">Flask-login</a> for my user logins. This normally works fine, but sometimes I see strange issues with logins being mixed. We've got 3 flask dev-servers running on one machine (on different ports) and we're working in an office with about 10 people (with one shared ip). The problem is that sometimes one user is suddenly logged in as another user. </p>  <p>I can't really pinpoint when or under which circumstances this happens. But I also don't really know how I can debug it. Could the source of the evil be that we share an internet connection or is the problem that we run several flask dev-servers on one machine?</p>  <p>I don't know whether this also happens with people outside of our office (we're still in testing phase).</p>  <p>Can anybody give me some tips on how I can debug this?</p>
