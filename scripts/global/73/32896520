<p>I am having a bit of trouble with some work with text files and the associated metadata for the files. I can read in the files, pre-process them, and then convert them to a readable format for the lda package I am using (<a href="http://cpsievert.github.io/LDAvis/reviews/reviews.html" rel="nofollow">using this guide by Sievert</a>). Example below:</p>  <pre><code>#Reading the files corpus &lt;- file.path("Folder/Fiction/texts") corpus &lt;- list.files(corpus) corpus &lt;- lapply(corpus, readLines)  ***pre-processing functions removed for space***  corp.list &lt;- strsplit(corpus, "[[:space:]]+")  # compute the table of terms: corpterm.table &lt;- table(unlist(corp.list)) corpterm.table &lt;- sort(corpterm.table, decreasing = TRUE)  ***removing stopwords, again removed for space***  # now put the corpus into the format required by the lda package: getCorp.terms &lt;- function(x) {   index &lt;- match(x, vocabCorp)   index &lt;- index[!is.na(index)]   rbind(as.integer(index - 1), as.integer(rep(1, length(index))))   }   corpus &lt;- lapply(corp.list, getCorp.terms) </code></pre>  <p>At this point, the <code>corpus</code> variable is a list of document tokens with a separate vector per document, but has been detached from its file path, and the name of the file. Herein is where my problem begins: I have a csv with the metadata for the texts (their file names, titles, authors, years, genres, etc.) which I would like to have associated with each vector of tokens, in order to easily model my information over time, by gender, etc. </p>  <p>I am unsure of how to do this, but am guessing it would need to be done as the files are being read, and not merged after I have manipulated the document texts. I would imagine it would be something that would look like:</p>  <pre><code>corpus.f &lt;- file.path (stuff) corpus &lt;- list.files(corpus) corpus &lt;- lapply(corpus, ReadLines) corpus.df &lt;- as.data.frame(c(corpus.f,corpus)) corpus.info &lt;- read.csv(stuff.csv) </code></pre>  <p>And from there using the merge or match function in combination to associate each document (or vector of document tokens) with its correct row of metadata. </p>
