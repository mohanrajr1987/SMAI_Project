<p>I am using the ALL.zip file located <a href="http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/PDownload.do" rel="nofollow">here</a>. My goal is to create a pandas DataFrame with it. However, if I run </p>  <p><code>data=pd.read_csv(foo.csv)</code></p>  <p>the column names do not match up. The first column has no name, and then the second column is labeled with the first, and the last column is a Series of NaN. So I tried </p>  <pre><code>colnames=[list of colnames] data=pd.read_csv(foo.csv, names=colnames, header=False) </code></pre>  <p>which gave me the exact same thing, so I ran</p>  <pre><code>data=pd.read_csv(foo.csv, names=colnames) </code></pre>  <p>which lined the colnames up perfectly, but had the csv assigned column names(the first line in the csv document) perfectly aligned as the first row of data it. So I ran </p>  <pre><code>data=data[1:] </code></pre>  <p>which did the trick.</p>  <p>So I found a work around without solving the actual problem. I looked at the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="nofollow">read_csv</a> document and found it a bit overwhelming, and could not figure out a way using only pd.read_csv to fix this problem. </p>  <p>What was the fundamental problem (I am assuming it is either user error or a problem with the file)? Is there a way to fix it with one of the commands from the read_csv?</p>  <p>Here is the first 2 rows from the csv file</p>  <pre><code>cmte_id,cand_id,cand_nm,contbr_nm,contbr_city,contbr_st,contbr_zip,contbr_employer,contbr_occupation,contb_receipt_amt,contb_receipt_dt,receipt_desc,memo_cd,memo_text,form_tp,file_num,tran_id,election_tp C00458844,"P60006723","Rubio, Marco","HEFFERNAN, MICHAEL","APO","AE","090960009","INFORMATION REQUESTED PER BEST EFFORTS","INFORMATION REQUESTED PER BEST EFFORTS",210,27-JUN-15,"","","","SA17A","1015697","SA17.796904","P2016", </code></pre>
