<p>So I have this excel sheet which has many categories, sub-categories and then there is a code for each row, some rows have the same code and I want to count those that have the same code as 3 instead of 2 only and then count all the rest as a singular.  What I am trying to do is to count the number of things in each category and print out the category name and the count that is in it </p>
