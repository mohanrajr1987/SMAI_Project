<p>I have a large dataset (~250,000 records) and I used <code>splitting</code> to make the data more approachable. I ended up with 250 splits. </p>  <p>I want to know which split has the most columns. I know I should be using <code>list.files</code>, but I am not sure how to make it work.</p>  <p>I created the following reproducible example:</p>  <pre><code>df1 &lt;- data.frame(A = c("a"),B = (c("b")), C = (c("c"))) df2 &lt;- data.frame(A = c("a"),B = (c("b"))) df3 &lt;- data.frame(A = c("a"))  write.csv(df1, file = "df1.csv", row.names=FALSE) write.csv(df2, file = "df2.csv", row.names=FALSE) write.csv(df3, file = "df3.csv", row.names=FALSE)  filenames &lt;- list.files(pattern="*.csv", full.names=TRUE) </code></pre>  <p>Looking at the example above, I'd like to know that <code>df1</code> has the most attributes compare to the other files.</p>  <p>Does <code>for</code> loop and a simple <code>ncol</code> function can make it work?</p>
