<p>I am running two SQL's on two different databases and comparing the results. I am writing the results to a csv file. Currently I am doing a 1 to 1 comparison of the results such that each element in a row of the result set is a row in the csv file.</p>  <pre><code>table name | source column | source value | target value | difference type | target column __________________________________________________________________________________________ Table A      Column A             A001          A001          SAME            Column A Table A      Column B             A002          B002          Different       Column B </code></pre>  <p>These are making the csv files far too long, and I wish to change this output to display each row of the result sets stacked on top of each other like this:</p>  <pre><code>A001 A002 A003 A001 B002 A003 </code></pre>  <p>But I am not sure of a good way to indicate which columns would be different (I cannot color code in a csv file). Adding a column to the end which says which columns are different is an option, but I feel like there must be a better way.</p>  <p>I will also take suggestions on other possible ways to format these results.</p>
