<p>I have a csv file with each row containing a review and each sentence of the review is in a separate column--so each row does not have the same number of columns. I wrote Python code to print out the total number of reviews and sentences, and also the max, min, and avg number of sentences per review. This worked on a small sample (5 rows). However, when I tried a larger csv file (10,000 rows) that I had copied the sample from, the max, min and avg all came out to be 18. I'm thinking maybe that the file is giving all of the rows the same number of columns (sentences) that the largest row has. If that's the case, is there a way to fix this? </p>  <p>Here is my code in case I've made a mistake in it:</p>  <pre><code>import csv  with open('reviews.csv', 'rt') as f:     reader = csv.reader(f)     num_sentences = []     for row in reader:         num_sentences.append(len(row))  print("Total reviews:", len(num_sentences)) print("Total Sentences:", sum(num_sentences))    print("Max sentences per review:", max(num_sentences)) print("Min sentences per review:", min(num_sentences)) print("Average sentences per review:", (sum(num_sentences)/(len(num_sentences))) </code></pre>  <p>Here is the file I am using:</p>  <pre><code>I had her for 2 classes and she was just awful.,Terrible teaching skills and     would have no idea what she was doing.,She'd curve her tests to make up for their poor quality.,"As a person, she was pretty nice but her teaching skills were SERIOUSLY lacking."
