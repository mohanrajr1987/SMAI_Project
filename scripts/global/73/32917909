<p>I am Prestashop novice user and trying to find out different product feeds which can be imported in to Prestashop product list from admin. For ex: datafeed for shoes, apparels, groceries etc.  I could only get the sample CSV format which is having feed for electronics but not the feed specific to the products. Can someone help me with the sample product list?</p>
