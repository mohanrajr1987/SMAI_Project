<p>I need some advices about good practices of importing data from server to local device. The amount of data is not very big ~1-3 MB So, I have to choose between:</p>  <ol> <li>receive json - parsing it, using GSON lib for simplicity and insert data into local DB</li> <li>receive whole DB in cvs format and then to populate my DB like is described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16672074/import-csv-file-to-sqlite-in-android">here</a> </li> <li>or receive the whole DB directly from server side and use it somehow like local one</li> </ol>  <p>I know, each method works but if somebody can give some arguments it will be appreciated.</p>
