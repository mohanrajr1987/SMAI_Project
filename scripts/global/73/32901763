<p>I have to write the outcomes I get in Excel into a CSV file. So I have a Variant matrix <code>Mxk</code> in VBA and a CSV file with <code>Nxk</code> entries. I want to write the matrix into the (N+1)th row in the CSV file. This is the code I use to read a CSV into VBA:</p>  <pre><code>Sub ReadCurve(pFile As String, pCurve As Variant, pYears As Integer)  Dim BestandNr Dim RegelStr As String, ArrayStr Dim r As Integer, i As Integer   m = 2800  n = pYears+ 1  ReDim pCurve(1 To m, 1 To n) As Variant BestandNr = FreeFile Open pFile For Input As #BestandNr Line Input #BestandNr, RegelStr  Do While Not EOF(BestandNr)     Line Input #BestandNr, RegelStr     ArrayStr = ParseString(RegelStr)      If ArrayStr(0) = "" Then         Exit Do     End If      r = r + 1      For i = 1 To n         pCurve(r, i) = ArrayStr(i - 1)      Next  Loop Close #BestandNr </code></pre>  <p>So I basically need something similar that outputs a variant matrix into a certain row in a CSV file. How do I do this?</p>
