<p>VBA downloads quotes from google finance and puts into "Data" sheet. Date and time are in 1 column and are derived by calculation (except for 1st row).</p>  <p>Next step is to operate on data clean it and put it into consumable format. I work on date-time column and paste them as values and copy this sheet in a new workbook and save the sheet of new workbook as CSV. And i get my perfect csv at mentioned location.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, all these steps are getting recorded by Macro Recorder of excel. </p>  <p>When i run the excel i get a CSV... BUT.. that CSV ends up having spoiled Date and Time formats. For unknown reasons AM/PM are added to last column. </p>  <p>Please note that my System Time settings are US locale and i have modified it to show short date as dd-mm-yy and short time as HH:mm:ss.  </p>  <p>You see there's no "tt" in my system settings. YET, excel somehow gives good results on saving manually, but when running same recorded vba it goes on to change date format to m-dd-yy and time format to hh:mm:ss and "tt" in next or last column !!</p>  <p>Can anyone please help me out of this bizarre situation ? </p>  <p>Any solution is welcome..</p>  <p><a href="http://speedy.sh/UkJWK/DataImport-1.xlsm" rel="nofollow">file for reference</a></p>
