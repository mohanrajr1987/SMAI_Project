<p>I have a requirement in that I receive CSV files from various sources with different formats. All the mappings are done in a SQL stored procedure. I would like to use the BizTalk to transfer the CSV files from SFTP locations to a local folder and inform SQL server that a file a received. Thus, from BizTalk I need to call a stored procedure only once per file. Not once for each line in the file. How can I achieve this? </p>
