<p>I have a method written in C# that is attempting to copy the data in a .CSV file into a MySQL table that looks like this;</p>  <pre><code>     public void writeToMySQL()      {         string constr = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["sqlString"].ConnectionString;         using (MySqlConnection sqlCon = new MySqlConnection(constr))         {             try             {                 sqlCon.Open();                 MySqlCommand sqlCmd = new MySqlCommand("LOAD DATA INFILE 'test.csv' INTO TABLE sdcdbftest.importexport;", sqlCon);                 sqlCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();             }             catch (MySqlException)             {                 throw;             }         }     }  </code></pre>  <p>What is happening however is that only the data from the first column of the .CSV file is copied over, nothing else. The .CSV file looks like so;</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SQUjZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SQUjZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>  </p>  <p>Finally this is how the table is structured on the Database through phpMyAdmin;</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5oKGX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5oKGX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Is there any obvious reason as to why only the first column (cs_id) is being copied over?</p>
