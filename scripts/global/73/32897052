<p>Switched my django project from storing media files referenced in a FileField of a model locally to storing them in an S3 bucket. With that change I am now limited to reading 10 columns and 100 rows of CSVs, and surely enough as I toggle the storage settings (DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE, MEDIA_URL) back, it can read the whole file. </p>  <p>Does anyone have an idea why this would be limited or how to fix it?</p>  <p>I use the code below to read the first few rows of the FileField file as a preview</p>  <pre><code>with open(upload_file.name, 'r') as myfile:         datareader = csv.reader(myfile)         for row in datareader:             if count == 3:                 break             csvData.append(row)             print(csvData) </code></pre>
