<p>I'm trying to export my report in CSV.  However, when it exports, it doesn't actually export the header row but instead uses the textbox's name from my table.  I would just rename all the textboxes but it is required that some of my headers contain spaces and a few have parenthesis which cannot be in an object name.  Is there a way to export in CSV that will give me my actual header row instead of the textbox names?</p>
