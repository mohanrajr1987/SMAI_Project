<p>I came across the exact question Im looking to answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/940774/3170942">How do you change headers in a CSV File with FasterCSV then save the new headers?</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately, the answer is out of date because FasterCSV is no longer an available solution. </p>  <p>Here's the example code given as an answer to that question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/940901/3170942">http://stackoverflow.com/a/940901/3170942</a></p>  <pre><code>require 'fastercsv'  input = File.open 'original.csv', 'r' output = File.open 'modified.csv', 'w' FasterCSV.filter input, output, :headers =&gt; true, :write_headers =&gt; true, :return_headers =&gt; true do |row|   change_headers(row) if row.header_row? end input.close output.close </code></pre>  <p>But when I tried to implement the recommended solution in my own program I realized that Ruby no longer allows FasterCSV. And the command line said:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Please switch to Ruby 1.9's standard CSV library.  It's FasterCSV plus   support for Ruby 1.9's m17n encoding engine.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I then tried removing 'Faster' from everywhere it said "FasterCSV'. Except it gave me:    </p>  <blockquote>   <p>undefined method `change_headers' for main:Object (NoMethodError)</p> </blockquote>  <p>What am I missing here?</p>
