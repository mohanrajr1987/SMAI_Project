<p>At the moment I'm using queries like the following with positive boosting of a term.</p>  <pre><code>    "query": {         "bool" : {             "must" : {                 "term" : { "title" : {value :"word", boost: 2.0}}             }          }       } </code></pre>  <p>This type of query is described <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/query-dsl-term-query.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I would like to know if it is possible to use negative boosting of term just like the above, but instead of 2.0 a -2.0. So like this:</p>  <pre><code>     "query": {         "bool" : {             "must" : {                 "term" : { "title" : {value :"word", boost: -2.0}}             }          }       } </code></pre>  <p>I couldn't find any documentation on it. It only tells the default value for boost is 1.0. And all examples use positive boosting. There is however some kind of negative boost ( described <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/not-quite-not.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), but that is boosting queries instead of terms.</p>
