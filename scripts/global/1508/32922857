<p>I want to store the below data onto mongodb. This data is collected from one machine</p>  <pre><code>{"Date":{"Time": "Sat Oct  3 05:42:37 PDT 2015"},  "Host":{"H": "ub"},  "Speed":{"cpu": 1444.2}} </code></pre>  <p>This data is collected from another machine</p>  <pre><code>{"Date":{"Time": "Sat Oct  3 05:14:54 PDT 2015"},  "Host":{"H": "ubuntu"},  "Speed":{"cpu": 2494.2}} </code></pre>  <p>Is it better to store them in single document on mongodb? so that while extracting data via GUI is easier? </p>  <p>If I store them as an array i.e <code>[{},{}]</code> it's loaded in 2 separate documents in mongodb.</p>  <p>Please let me how to combine the above data and store them on mongodb so that accessing via browser becomes easier. </p>
