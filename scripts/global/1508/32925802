<p>I am trying to request an API from a site, if I did not send </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Accept: application/vnd.travis-ci.2+json</p> </blockquote>  <p>with the header, the response will come as an XML format. What I want is a JSON format. So, I need to send that header with the blow code. </p>  <pre><code>url = 'https://api.example.org/books/title' import json, urllib2 response = urllib2.urlopen(url) jsonString = response.read() repo = json.loads(jsonString) </code></pre>  <p>The above doesn't do anything, because <code>url</code> is being returned in xml format, unless I add <code>Accept: application/vnd.travis-ci.2+json</code> to the request</p>
