<p>I've been working with Ionic lately for a project and I am trying to pull data from an API that gives the results in a JSON object. The object looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>{"status":{"error":"none","code":200,"description":"none","message":"success"},"people":[{"peopleID":"52735","peopleName":"John","streetAddress":"7700 Kennedy Rd","city":"Blacklick","state":"OH","postalCode":"43004","distance":"0.75"}, {"peopleID":"555555","peopleName":"Bill","streetAddress":"7700 Kennedy Rd","city":"Blacklick","state":"OH","postalCode":"43004","distance":"0.75"}, {"peopleID":"52735","peopleName":"John","streetAddress":"7700 Kennedy Rd","city":"Blacklick","state":"OH","postalCode":"43004","distance":"0.75"}]} </code></pre>  <p>In my <code>controller.js</code> file I have created a controller for a pull to refresh. </p>  <pre><code>.controller('PullToRefresh', ['$scope', '$http', function($scope,$http){     var url = "url defined here";     $scope.items = [1,2,3];     $scope.doRefresh = function(){       console.log('doing refresh');       console.log(url);       $http.jsonp(url)         .success(function(newItems){           console.log('success');           $scope.items = newItems;         })         .error(function(){           console.log('error');         })         .finally(function(){           console.log("done");           $scope.$broadcast('scroll.refreshComplete');         });     };   }]); </code></pre>  <p>The controller hits the URL just fine, but when the call complete it will error and never hit .success, I receive <code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :</code> At this point I am afraid I am still too new to figure this out, I have not had issues with the JSON object before. </p>
