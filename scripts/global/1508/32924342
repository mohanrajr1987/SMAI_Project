<p>i know PHP is a server side script and js is a client side but i have an issue.. </p>  <p>I needed to bypass the browser security when doing an ajax request to another domain and it was difficult for me to be honest i had no idea what i was doing so i turned to php.. wooohooo....</p>  <p>The issue is i can only use JS and CSS to run arbitrarily ontop of my tracking system!</p>  <p>I wanted to add a newsfeed.csv so i made this php code to get the csv and convert it and store it into the variable $json.</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;?php $file="http://www.jonar.com/portal/partner/js/newsroomcustomer.csv"; $csv= file_get_contents($file); $checkit = utf8_encode($csv); $array = array_map("str_getcsv", explode("\n", $checkit)); $json = json_encode($array); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to do an ajax get to get the variables output? meaning the json format of my csv..</p>  <p>This way i can have my PHP script on my webserver and it will be able to grab any link on any domain..</p>  <p>Thanks guys :)</p>
