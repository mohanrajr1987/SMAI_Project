<p>I have the following JSON object:</p>  <pre><code>var data = {     "images": [{         "id" : "obj_0" ,         "src" : "background.jpg",         "width" : "640",         "height" : "480"     }] }; </code></pre>  <p>I want to change the src value in this string with jQuery. Like: I select an image with <code>&lt;input type="file" /&gt;</code>. When I select an image like that, I want to change the JSON object "src" on the same page without reload.</p>
