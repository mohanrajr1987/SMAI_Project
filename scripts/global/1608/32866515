<p>I'm using Apache CXF out interceptors to make two digital signatures in my SOAP envelope.</p>  <p>I've already have WSS4JStaxOutInterceptor, which signs an entire envelope. This interceptor is working good.</p>  <p>But now i have to sign a certain node in my envelope. That means, i must add a custom interceptor, invoke it <strong><em>before</em></strong> WSS4JStaxOutInterceptor, take an XML body from SoapMessage, find and sign this node.</p>  <p>I found just one way extract XML body from SoapMessage. This way discribed here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12948702/3929917">http://stackoverflow.com/a/12948702/3929917</a></p>  <p>This way works fine and extract XML doing  <code>message.getInterceptorChain().doIntercept(message);</code></p>  <p>But as i understand, this code invokes next phase (write) to get XML body. That's why, WSS4JStaxOutInterceptor invokes too. And in my custom interceptor I receive an XML body, where the outer signature already there. So, i can't sign internal node, because outer signature will be invalid.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get XML body from SoapMessage on PRE_STREAM phase without invoking next phase?</p>
