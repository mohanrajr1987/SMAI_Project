<p>I'm working on a MICROS RES 3700 POS integration using the webservice API. I am already able to place simple orders but I couldn't make the condiments work.</p>  <p>The POS just ignores the condiment array i send with the MenuItem. Can someone show me a example of the XML condiment array structure? The documentation says it's the same structure of a MeuItem but it doesn't work.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
