<p>Have a Web application which connects to a jax-ws service. Want to send security credentials in the header. But.. I know that there are two types of headers:  1) soap header, which I can set with handler in client side  2) http header in transport layer </p>  <p>Can anybody explain pros and cons of setting additional information in each of these headers? What is the best practice? </p>
