<p>Forgive me if this is a dumb question, I unfortunately have an assignment due! I am running apache axis under tomcat and need to deploy a simple web service class, see below. </p>  <p>I installed the counter file below as "MyCounter.jws" in the /tomcat/webapps/axis/ folder. Tomcat finds it and makes a corresponding MyCounter.xml. I use WSDL2Java on the XML file and client calls seem to work, but internal state is not saved:</p>  <p>Every time I call MyCounter.call from the client side, the return value is always 1. It seems the constructor is always called before the method call. How can I make it so the mycounter integer persists across requests?</p>  <pre><code>public class MyCounter {     int mycounter;      public MyCounter()     {         mycounter = 0;     }      public int call()     {         mycounter++;         return mycounter;     } } </code></pre>
