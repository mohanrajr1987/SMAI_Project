<p>I'm making a soap web services in Java with JAX-WS and GlassFish as container.</p>  <p>The web service works fine but in the server logs I see a warning:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning:   WSP1021: Fault "null" not bound. Check names in port and binding definitions.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have searched on google but I really can't understand what that means.</p>  <p>It seems to be relate of each web method that throws my costum exception.</p>  <p>Someone have some information ? </p>
