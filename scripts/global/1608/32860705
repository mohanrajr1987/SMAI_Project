<p>I have to implement a client for server application which apparently accepts <strong>SOAP12</strong> messages with content type: <code>application/soap+xml</code>, but in response returns content type: <code>text/xml</code>.</p>  <p>Naturally this is causing issues with Spring's <code>WebServiceGatewaySupport</code> which cannot 'internalize' the response due to content type mismatch.</p>  <p>Before i start considering some hacks or custom soap client implementations i would like to know the answer to the following questions:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Is the server application obliged to support content type <code>application/soap+xml</code> by the standard and use it when it returns the response ?</p></li> <li><p>If the above is true, i am looking for direct online reference for this.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I have went through some documents like this one:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part2-20030624/#ietf-draft" rel="nofollow">soap12 content type</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Conforming implementations of this binding:   MUST be capable of sending and receiving messages serialized using media type "application/soap+xml" whose proper use and parameters are described in A. The application/soap+xml Media Type.   MAY send requests and responses using other media types providing that such media types provide for at least the transfer of SOAP XML Infoset.   MAY, when sending requests, provide an HTTP Accept header field. This header field:</p>      <p>SHOULD indicate an ability to accept at minimum "application/soap+xml".</p>      <p>MAY additionally indicate willingness to accept other media types that satisfy 2 above.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But it is not clear to me from the above must the server use application/soap +xml or it is free not to do it ?</p>  <p>Also this:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3902.txt" rel="nofollow">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3902.txt</a></p>
