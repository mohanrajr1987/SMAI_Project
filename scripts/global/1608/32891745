<p>I'm receiving this error when testing my integration with ADFS against our 3.0-testbed. It works fine in our current production-environment using 2.1:</p>  <p>"ID3242: The security token could not be authenticated or authorized."</p>  <p>I'm using .Net and the Microsoft.IdentityModel classes and the endpoint on <a href="https://adfsserver/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed" rel="nofollow">https://adfsserver/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed</a> with with the following code: </p>  <pre><code>var factory = new WSTrustChannelFactory( new UserNameWSTrustBinding(System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential),             new System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress(_adfsurl));  factory.Credentials.UserName.UserName = username; factory.Credentials.UserName.Password = password; factory.Credentials.ServiceCertificate.Authentication.CertificateValidationMode = System.ServiceModel.Security.X509CertificateValidationMode.None; factory.TrustVersion = System.ServiceModel.Security.TrustVersion.WSTrust13; var client = factory.CreateChannel() as WSTrustChannel;  var request = new RequestSecurityToken()         {             RequestType = WSTrust13Constants.RequestTypes.Issue,             AppliesTo = new System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress(endpoint),             KeyType = WSTrust13Constants.KeyTypes.Bearer         };  var token = client.Issue(request); </code></pre>  <p>No matter what I use as username, password or appliesTo/relying party. I get the same error and no other information.</p>  <p>Has anyone had the same issues? Is this something different in ADFS 3.0 or simply something else that we have configured differently which breaks the functionality. I have limited access to the ADFS-server, so I would appreciate any explanation of what and where to check logs if any.  (I can post the full SOAP-request instead of the c#-code if that would be helpful.)</p>  <p>Why is this request suddenly failing on the new server?</p>
