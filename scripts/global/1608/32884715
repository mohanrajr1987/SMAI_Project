<p>I've got some code that creates a PHP SOAP Object. Most of the time I get the results back that I expect but sometimes I get the error:</p>  <pre><code>Fatal error: Uncaught SoapFault exception: [Client] looks like we got no XML document in...  </code></pre>  <p>My code obviously works so I assume it's a server setting (max_execution_time??) but is it the webservice or on my client server?</p>
