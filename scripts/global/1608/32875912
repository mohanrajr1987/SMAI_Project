<p>I faced with very strange issue when tried to use PHP SoapClient for this service <a href="http://bws.neteven.com/NWS/2" rel="nofollow">http://bws.neteven.com/NWS/2</a>.</p>  <p>I have to setup an authentication header. Request body should be empty. The code, which I used is below:   </p>  <pre><code>    $client = new SoapClient("http://bws.neteven.com/NWS/2", array("trace" =&gt; 1, "exception" =&gt; 1));     $auth = array(//the params are not valid of course         'Method' =&gt; 'TestConnection',         'Login' =&gt; 'login',         'Seed' =&gt; 'seed',         'Stamp' =&gt; 'stamp',         'Signature' =&gt; 'signature'     );     $client-&gt;__setSoapHeaders(new SoapHeader('auth', 'AuthenticationHeader', $auth));     $client-&gt;__soapCall('TestConnection',array(null)); </code></pre>  <p>After that I used $client->__getLastRequest() to see what is final XML of the request. However I can see that the header and body params were not setup properly.  $client->__getLastRequest() outputs plain text like this:</p>  <pre><code>MethodTestConnectionLoginloginSeedseedStampstampSignaturesignature </code></pre>  <p>Which doesn't look like valid XML. So of course I get SoapFault exception with the text "Body must be present in a SOAP envelope".</p>  <p>Does anybody knows why header and body are not wrapped by required XML tags?</p>  <p>Any issue in the code? Because I saw lots of examples of PHP SoapClient usage with the same approach. In addition I tried a few test WSDL services and had valid requests and responses there.</p>  <p>Could it be a problem of provided WSDL schema?</p>  <p>Or a problem of my server configuration? I use PHP 5.6.3, php_soap extension is enabled.</p>  <p>Hope you guys can help me. Any your thoughts would be really appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
