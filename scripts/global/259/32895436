<p>When I put ∃ (or various other maths characters) into Sublime Text 2 it displays a question mark in a box. It might be � but it's rendered as an upright box instead of a diamond.</p>  <p>I copied � into sublime text and it rendered it in the same way that it rendered ∃.</p>  <p>All the characters in question are rendering correctly in notepad and chrome. I'm on Windows 10 if that matters.</p>  <p>Is there something that I can do to make these characters display properly in Sublime Text?</p>  <p>Update: As roeland pointed out the issue was that the font being used didn't contain glyphs for the characters. Apparently Unicode complete fonts are uncommon. I'm using <a href="http://czyborra.com/unifont/unifont.ttf" rel="nofollow">http://czyborra.com/unifont/unifont.ttf</a> now (the only good size is 12pt). </p>
