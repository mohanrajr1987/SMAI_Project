<p>I have this problem I have to solve.  I am given a coordinate lat/lon, and I need to find a random point within 3 meters of this original point. Approximations are good, but all I could find was this <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/2951/algorithm-for-offsetting-a-latitude-longitude-by-some-amount-of-meters">http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/2951/algorithm-for-offsetting-a-latitude-longitude-by-some-amount-of-meters</a> that has a 10 meter error. Thank you.</p>
