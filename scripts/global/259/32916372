<p>The problem in question is to check an equation, example:</p>  <p>a * b / c + d = x</p>  <p>Where a - d are unique numbers from 1 - 4.</p>  <p>Now obviously you could run through all the possibilities, then skip when it has duplicates, but this would be O(n^n), when you should be able to solve this with O(n!) but I can't figure out how. </p>  <p>Is there an algorithm for this?</p>
