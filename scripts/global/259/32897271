<p>I'm practicing my math/algorithm skills and am trying to divide two numbers using only subtraction. I'm pretty close, but I can't seem to handle decimals and I don't know why? In the lowest level of the stack, when I call divide(9,2), I notice that I'm returning "0", when in fact I want to return 1/2 - but without using the division operator... inside the if x is less than y check, should I add that logic in a subroutine? I'm stuck on how to recursively add numbers after the decimal up to three places. </p>  <pre><code>    var divide = function(x, y) {         //the number of times you need to subtract y from x.        if (y === 0) {         return 0       }        // if        if (x - y === 0) {         return 1;       }        if (x &lt; y) {     // if this is the case, get the value of y - x.  -&gt;1     var diff = y - x;     console.log(diff);     // add a zero to the end --&gt; so in our case, 10     diff = String(diff) + '0';     console.log(diff);     diff = Number(diff);     console.log(diff);     // is that now divisible by y? is so how many times? in our case, 5 times.     var decimal = Number(divide(diff, y));     var number = "." + decimal;     //so add .5 to it.     return number;   } else {         return (1 + divide(x - y, y));        }      };      var modulo = function(x, y) {        var val = x;       while (val &gt;= y) {         val -= y;        }       return val;      }; </code></pre>
