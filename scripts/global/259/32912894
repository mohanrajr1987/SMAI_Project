<p>I already have a 64 bit hash function in a library (C coding), but I only need 48 bits... So, I need to trim down the 64 bit hash value to a 48 bit value, yet it has to be in a safe manner in order to "keep" the information from all 64 bits and to minimize collision...<br> The basic idea is to have all bits in the 64-bit hash value effect on the resulting 48-bit hash value.<br> Is there any way to do that?<br> BTW: The hash function: it's a very good 64 bit hash function. It has been tested with SMHasher (the "DieHarder" hash testing) and proved better than Murmur2.<br> PS: According to my colleagues, the algorithm implemented in the lib for 64-bit hashing is xxHash, tested with SMHasher and got a Q.Score of 10!</p>
