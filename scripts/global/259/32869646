<p>I have a system, where user is getting some question and basically if he responds correctly then his score increases by 1, if he is wrong then decreases by 1.</p>  <p>So what I want is to recommend a question based on a user score, which he have at this particular moment. My goal is that users receives a question appropriate to his level(of course with some initial learning).</p>  <p>What are the ways/algorithms I can achieve that?</p>
