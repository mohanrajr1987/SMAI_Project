<p>I would like your opinion on my shell script that prints the fibonacci sequence.</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  first=0 second=1 third=1 echo -n "Term: " read term  fub=$((second+third)) echo $second echo $third echo $fub  for ((i=1; i&lt;term; i++)) do   third=$((fub+third))   echo $third   fub=$((third+fub))   echo $fub done </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pexSS.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pexSS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I tried to calculate the fibonacci sequence in the most simplest way (without the use of recursive functions).</p>
