<p>I would like to draw a radar on a pictureBox. Drawing points is no problem but I am struggling with basic maths. Maybe I am too tired.</p>  <p>I have a pictureBox that is 200x200. I have loaded a small, centered image inside the picturebox (4x4) which symbolizes the current player.</p>  <p>I have build a function called </p>  <blockquote>   <p>PaintRadar(int meX, int meY, int enemyX, int enemyY)</p> </blockquote>  <p>The parameters could have the following values: meX = 27000, meY = 30000, enemyX = 26000, enemyY = 28000</p>  <p>The desired result is to have the enemies around me and I am always centered in the pictureBox. What do I have to calculate to center meX and meY in the pictureBox?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
