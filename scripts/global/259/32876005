<p>Consider the sequence</p>  <p>3⁰ ,3¹,3²,...,3¹⁰⁰⁰</p>  <p>of integers.</p>  <p>Prove that this sequence contains two distinct elements whose difference is divisible by 1000. That is, prove that there exist two integers m and n with 0 ≤ m &lt; n ≤ 1000, such that 3ⁿ − 3ᵐ is divisible by 1000.</p>  <p>Use the first part to prove that this sequence contains an element whose decimal representation ends with 001. In other words, the last three digits in the decimal representation are 001</p>
