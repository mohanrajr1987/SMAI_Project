<p>3 boys go to the restaurant. Their bill was 75 rs.. So they contributed 25 each. Manager then gives 5 rs back to the waiter and then waiter gave 3 rs back to then and put 2 rs into his pocket.. So their actual contribution is 24 because they got 1-1 rs back. so 24*3=72 and 2 rs into the waiter's pocket. so 74+2=74 where is 1 rs?</p>
