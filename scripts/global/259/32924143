<p>I want to draw a line that signifies the altitude of a triangle.  I know all 3 points of the circle (a, b, c).  I want to draw the altitude through a.</p>  <p>I have the following functions to work out the perpendicular gradient of bc</p>  <pre><code>gradient = function(a, b) {     return b.y - a.y / b.x - a.x; };  perpendicularGradient = function (a, b) {   return -1 / gradient(a, b); }; </code></pre>  <p>I can now get the equation of the line using <code>y = mx + c</code> for line of a with a perpendicular slope of bc and I can work out the y intercept.</p>  <pre><code>function perpendicularLine(vertex, a, b) {   // b = y - m * x   var slope = perpendicularGradient(a, b),       yIntercept = (- slope * vertex.x) + vertex.y;    //how do I find the coordinates of the point on bc to draw a line from vertex }  </code></pre>  <p>I don't know what to do next, i.e. how do I find the coordinates of the point on bc to join the line from a.</p>  <p>From googling about, I know I could use vectors but I have not covered that yet on my maths course and I would prefer to use the equation of a line.</p>
