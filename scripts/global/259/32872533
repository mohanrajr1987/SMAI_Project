<p>So I'm new to Java and I have an assignment to do for class, but I'm stuck. The class is supposed to find the intersection of two lines using the quadratic equation. I was told to have specific inputs for class, so d = 5, f = -3, g = 2, m = 1 and b = 3 and the two intersections are supposed to be (1,4) and (-.20,2.8). The problem I'm running into is that the output returns (NaN,NaN) and (NaN,NaN) instead of the right answer. Is there anything wrong with my code that is making me get this answer? </p>  <pre><code>public class Intersect{ public static void main(String args[]){      //prompt user for parabola vars d f g     System.out.println("Enter the constant d:");     int d = IO.readInt();     System.out.println("Enter the constant f:");     int f = IO.readInt();     System.out.println("Enter the constant g:");     int g = IO.readInt();      // y = dx^2 + fx + g      //promt user for line vars m b      System.out.println("Enter the constant m:");     int m = IO.readInt();     System.out.println("Enter the constant b:");     int b = IO.readInt();      // y = mx + b      //compute intersection     // dx^2 + fx + g = mx + b      // x^2 * (d) + x * (f-m) + (g-b) = 0       int a = d;     int z = (f-m);     int c = (g-b);      double x1 = -z + (Math.sqrt (z^2 - 4 * a * c) / (2 * a));     double x2 = -z - (Math.sqrt (z^2 - 4 * a * c) / (2 * a));     double y1 = m * x1 + b;     double y2 = m * x2 - b;      //output each intersection on its own line, System.out.println() is ok for this answer submission     System.out.println("The intersection(s) are:");     System.out.println("(" + x1 + "," + y1 + ")");     System.out.println("(" + x2 + "," + y2 + ")"); } } </code></pre>
