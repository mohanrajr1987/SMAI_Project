<p>This is for Project Euler, problem #5. </p>  <p>The task is to find the smallest number evenly divisible by numbers 1-20. My code seems to work on 1-18, but at 19 my browser starts timing out. This leads me to believe my code is just inefficient. </p>  <p>How can I mitigate this?</p>  <pre><code>function divisible(a){     counter = 0;     result = 2;     while (counter &lt; a){         for (var x = 0; x &lt;= a; x ++){             if (result % x === 0){                 counter ++;             }         }         if (counter != a){             counter = 0;             result ++;         }     }     return result; } divisible(20) </code></pre>
