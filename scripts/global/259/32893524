<p>Imagine I have two points <code>[x1,y1], [x2,y2]</code> and I know, that <code>y1</code>is smaller than 0 while <code>y2</code> is bigger. And also <code>x1</code>is just one px smaller than <code>x2</code>. Now I need a way to create an equation that goes through both points and then I want to know what <code>x3</code> will be on the equations y0-point. // What <code>x</code> the equation will give me, when entering "0" as y-coord.</p>  <p>Do you know any equation to be like: <code>x = ...x1...x2...y1...y2</code>?</p>  <p>Thank you :)</p>  <p>EDIT:  This whole thing will be represented in a JavaScript script, to show graphs that leave the field of view. So please don't mark it as off-topic..</p>
