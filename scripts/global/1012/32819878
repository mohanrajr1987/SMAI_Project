<p>i was worked fine on android studio before upgrading to kali 2.0. After installing 2.0 , tried to install studio . But while downloading additional components it fails as MKSDCARDERROR . I googled and found it is a common issue , because of not enabling 32 bit arch. I enabled i386 arch. And tried to install .. some packages as in answers . but all leads to unmet depencies problem. Please help Thank you </p>
