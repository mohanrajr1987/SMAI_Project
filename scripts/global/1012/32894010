<p>Currently on the server</p>  <p>$ cat /etc/debian_version 6.0.10 $ dpkg -l | grep mysql</p>  <p>But I need to install mysql 5.6 packages. I looked at the official page</p>  <p><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/</a></p>  <p>but it does not provide a mysql-ap-config package for debian 6 (the earliest one I found is mysql-apt-config_0.3.7-1debian7_all.deb) Can I compile it from sources or is there a an apt-get config that will allow me to install mysql 5.6?</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated...</p>
