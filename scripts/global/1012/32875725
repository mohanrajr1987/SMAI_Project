<p>Welcome.</p>  <p>I'm using ISPConfig panel for my VPS with Debian 6.0, so I wanted to install pure-ftpd which is supported by it. Anyway I cant do it, because of some strange errors. I tried: </p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get purge pure-ftpd sudo apt-get autoremove sudo apt-get autoclean sudo apt-get update </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't help. That's my problem:</p>  <pre><code> Reading state information... Done     pure-ftpd is already the newest version.     0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.     2 not fully installed or removed.

I installed it, but know I can not start it, I've got such error: </p>  <pre><code>    service pure-ftpd start : not foundt/pure-ftpd-common: 3: : not foundt/pure-ftpd-common: 8: : not foundt/pure-ftpd-common: 14: : not foundt/pure-ftpd-common: 19: : not foundt/pure-ftpd-common: 22: </code></pre>
