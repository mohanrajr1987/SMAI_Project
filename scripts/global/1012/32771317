<p>I want to create a debian package that when installed, it will install several python packages with pip. I can think of two ways:</p>  <ol> <li><p>install the python packages into a directory then make a debian package from that directory. But this will confuse the building host (such as its pip metadata), especially if the host already installed some of those packages.</p></li> <li><p>make a debian package with all python packages, and during debian install and uninstall, run some scripts to install/uninstall the python packages. But this will need two more scripts to be maintained, and some place to hold all the python packages in the installed machine.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Any other solution and what's the best way to solve this problem?</p>
