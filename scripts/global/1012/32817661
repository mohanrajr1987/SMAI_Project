<p>I wrote a Node.JS application that uses the <code>fluent-ffmpeg</code> module to watermark videos uploaded on the platform. I pushed the code to a my Google Cloud Compute Engine project, and every time I get <code>Error : Cannot Find FFMPEG</code>. I ssh'd into the instance once it was created and ran these commands to install <code>FFMPEG</code> before actually testing out the code. I am not sure what is causing the error because after this I am positive that <code>FFMPEG</code> is installed. </p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg export FFMPEG_PATH="/usr/bin/ffmpeg" export FFPROBE_PATH="/usr/bin/ffprobe" </code></pre>
