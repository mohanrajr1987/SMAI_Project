<p>I'm fairly new to Linux but really willing to understand what's going on. I usually spend a lot of time on Google trying to solve the problem myself but this time, I really don't get it.</p>  <p>I'm running Linux debian-pierre 3.16.0-4-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3 (2015-08-04) i686 GNU/Linux</p>  <p>Here is my problem: When importing libraries I added myself (eg <em>request</em>, <em>psutil</em>, <em>serial</em>) in a Python script, I get :</p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/home/pierre/documents/script/xbee/comm.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;     import serial   File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/serial/__init__.py", line 21, in &lt;module&gt;     from serial.serialposix import *   File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/serial/serialposix.py", line 15, in &lt;module&gt;     import sys, os, fcntl, termios, struct, select, errno, time ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/select.so: undefined symbol: _PyInt_AsInt </code></pre>  <p>I can't import them either when running Python from the command line.  Those modules are stored in <code>/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/</code>.</p>  <p><code>sys.path</code> gives:</p>  <pre><code>[   '',    '/usr/local/lib/python27.zip',    '/usr/local/lib/python2.7',    '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/plat-linux3',               '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-tk',    '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-old',    '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload',    '/home/pierre/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages',    '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages' ] </code></pre>  <p>so the path to the folder containing the modules is included. The thing I really don't understand is that one of the libraries in this path can be loaded while the others not. I'm totally confused.</p>  <p>After rebuilding my laptop I installed another version of Python 2.7 because I didn't know it was already installed with Debian. The problems started from then. It really seems like Python doesn't fetch the modules from the right place, but why?</p>  <p>If anyone can help it would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>I built myself a server (cubieboard) with Cubian on it, wrote scripts, installed those libraries, use them without a problem... So I'm REALLY confused.</p>
