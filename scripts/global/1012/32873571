<p>OS: Debian Jessie </p>  <p>I want to update git repository in user folder each time system start.</p>  <p>I tried this with cron @reboot entry. Cron started too early and in result mailed me with  "SSH: Could not resolve hostname ..."</p>  <p>Then I tried SysV init scripts. Effect - the same.</p>  <p>Currently I'm trying systemd services with the same faulty reports.</p>  <p>/usr/bin/git_repo</p>  <pre><code>#! /bin/sh # Description:       Updates local git repository with latest content #cd /home/tanglor/repo su -c'cd repo;git pull' - tanglor </code></pre>  <p>/etc/systemd/system/repo.service</p>  <pre><code>[Unit] Description = Updates local git repository with latest content Wants=network-online.target After=network-online.target [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/usr/bin/repo [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target </code></pre>  <p>Still no result. I mean in syslog I find:</p>  <pre><code>Sep 30 19:41:59 Khlavan repo[422]: ssh: Could not resolve hostname bitbucket.org: Name or service not known Sep 30 19:41:59 Khlavan repo[422]: fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Sep 30 19:41:59 Khlavan repo[422]: Please make sure you have the correct access rights Sep 30 19:41:59 Khlavan repo[422]: and the repository exists. Sep 30 19:41:59 Khlavan systemd[1]: repo.service: main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE Sep 30 19:41:59 Khlavan systemd[1]: Failed to start Updates local git repository with latest content. Sep 30 19:41:59 Khlavan systemd[1]: Unit repo.service entered failed state. </code></pre>  <p>How to achieve repository updates with each system start?</p>  <p>One solution is to use script with sleep command which will wait till some ssh test will succeed and then complete. But this is the last resort, I would like to solve this by-the-book.</p>
