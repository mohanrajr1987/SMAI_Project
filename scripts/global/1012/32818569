<p>I have a script that does it's job perfectly on Windows but not on Debian. Both run the same PHP versions and I can't seem to figure out why it isn't working on Debian.</p>  <pre><code>$content = file_get_contents('ua.log'); $arr = explode(PHP_EOL, $content);  foreach($arr as $x) {     $i = explode(' ', $x);     if($i[11] == '"user/agent1.0"'){         $ips[] = $i[0];     }     else{     }; }; </code></pre>  <p>I have checked permissions and used the long directory (/var/www/ua.log). Still doesn't seem to be working as $i returns NULL.</p>
