<p>I've set up a vm server with google app engine. The machine type is n1-standard-1(<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types" rel="nofollow">more info</a>) and the OS is Debian 7. What I want to do is have some kind of GUI. Is it possible? How can you do it?</p>  <p>I tried installing LXDE but when I type "startx" I get a "Fatal server error: no screens foud(EE)". I then figured I should check the video stuff so I downloaded some utils to get lspci. When I run lspci, I get the following output:</p>  <pre><code>00:01.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 ISA (rev 03) 00:01.3 Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 03) 00:03.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Red Hat, Inc Virtio SCSI 00:04.0 Ethernet controller: Red Hat, Inc Virtio network device </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure how to interpret this; I guess there is no video controller? Could I still run LXDE or another GUI?</p>  <p>p.s: Really not a unix guy</p>
