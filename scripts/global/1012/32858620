<p>I've run into an issue that I don't believe will effect how the program works in the long-run, but it made me curious. (I'm also new to stackoverflow, please bear with me. =))</p>  <p>I'm running kali linux 2.0 whenever executing this code. Debian distro.</p>  <p>So I have a csv file that I've changed to .txt and put it into my script. the first things my script does is ask the user for a filename, then assigns the input to a variable. Then it opens the file and assigns it's contents to another variable.</p>  <pre><code>f = raw_input('filename &gt; ') f_ = open(f) f__ = f_.read()  x = f infile=open(x, 'r') lines=infile.readlines() outtext = ['%d %s' % (i, line) for i, line in enumerate (lines)] f_o = (str("".join(outtext))) print f_o with open(x) as f:     totallines = sum(1 for _ in f) print "total lines:", totallines, "\n"  f_nr = f_o.replace(""" """, "") print f_nr # HERE is where I get the issue. </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>If I run this code with a 242 line txt document with fairly large lines, while in fullscreen mode, I don't see the entire output.. But if I run it in windowed view of the terminal, I can see the numbered list that's been created without returns.</p>
