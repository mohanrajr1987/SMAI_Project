<p>Debian 8 (Jessie) x64<br> <strong>Goal:</strong> I want to manage from which repository package will be installed/updated.<br> <strong>Verbal rules:</strong><br> - If package exist in jessie backports then it will be installed from jessie backports<br> - If package does not exist in jessie backports then install it from regular jessie repositories<br> - Install foobar and its dependences from foobar.com (does not matter is these packages exists in regular jessie repositories or not)<br> - Does not install any different packages from foobar.com<br></p>  <pre><code># cat /etc/apt/apt.conf APT::Default-Release "jessie";  # cat /etc/apt/preferences Package: foobar dependence1 dependence2 Pin: origin "foobar.com" Pin-Priority: 993  Package: * Pin: origin "foobar.com" Pin-Priority: -10  Package: * Pin: release n=jessie Pin-Priority: 500  Package: * Pin: release n=jessie-backports Pin-Priority: 999  Package: * Pin: release n=jessie-updates Pin-Priority: 500 </code></pre>  <p><strong>Questions:</strong><br> 1. Does I configure system correctly to achieve my goal?<br> 2. Does I broke something? (updates from regular repositories, security.debian.org, etc.)<br> 3. Biggest priority (within the limits of one range described in man apt_preferences) means biggest priority of repository? For example, package exists in 2 repositories. First repository have priority 992, second 993. Package will be installed from repository with priority 993?</p>
