<p>On a Beaglebone Black Rev C, how can an OS be copied from the SD card to eMMC?  </p>  <p>The eMMC still has Debian 7.8.  The SD card boots with Debian 8.2 and various additional applications.  Now that everything works correctly on the SD card, I want to copy it to the eMMC.</p>  <p>All of the examples that I have been able to find start with a flasher download which would mean reinstalling and configuring everything on the SD card.</p>
