<p>I installed postfix as email server. Everything is working good, but the command line mail, or sendmail, was not working anymore after installing the DKIM and DMARC protection. I read a lot of documentation, (because I'm a bit beginner in email server environment) but the postfix documentation say :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>As Postfix is not built with the Sendmail libmilter library, you may need to configure the Milter protocol version that Postfix should use. The default version is 6 (before Postfix 2.6 the default version is 2).</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>/etc/postfix/main.cf:     # Postfix ≥ 2.6     milter_protocol = 6     # 2.3 ≤ Postfix ≤ 2.5     milter_protocol = 2 </code></pre>  <p>And my version of postfix is 2.9.6, so milters protocol should be setup to 6 but with 6, it's not working, if I put milters_protocol 2, the mail command is working...I try to understand why, but I would like to get your advise/idea about this ?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
