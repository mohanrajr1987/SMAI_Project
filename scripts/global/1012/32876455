<p>I have Debian Wheezy installed on my BBB (on the emmc). I can mount the usb-drive and I have access to its files. But when I am downloading packages I always get to the point where the download stops because there is no space left on the BBB. But there is still space left on the mounted usb-drive and it is not used(I also tried that with an SD-card and its storage isn't used either). </p>  <p>So what do I have to do if I want my BBB to automatically use the free external storage when downloading packages?</p>
