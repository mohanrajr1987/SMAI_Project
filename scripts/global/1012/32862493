<p>I installed QT creator in debian linux. If I try to create a new project, in Kit option I got the error like "No valid Kit found". If I go to Tools ->Options -> Build&amp;Run -> kit, there is no options to select. But I installed same in ubuntu, it is working fine without same problem. What im missing?</p>  <p>Also suggest me if I need to reinstall the QT creator or something else...</p>
