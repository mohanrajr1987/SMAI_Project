<p>I have a Debian Jessie 8.2. I set up encrypted volumes for root and swap. At boot time I get:</p>  <pre><code>Loading, please wait... [    3.1117072] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdf] No Caching mode found [    3.1117142] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdf] Assuming drive cache: write through   One or more specified logical volumes(s) not found. Unable to find LVM volume group/root_crypt   One or more specified logicial volume(s) not found. Unable to find LVM volume group/swap_crypt     Reading all physical volumes. This may take a while...   Found volume group "group" using metadata type lvm2   3 logicial volume(s) in group "group" now active Please unlock disk group-root_crypt: </code></pre>  <p>which looks fine I guess. Is there any way to get these encrypted drives auto loaded at boot time without having to type passwords in?</p>
