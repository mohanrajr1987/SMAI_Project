<p>I want to have a shared folder using Samba and this folder should be protected by an username-password combination (kind of usual actually). What I've done so far:</p>  <ol> <li>Installed samba (was already installed)</li> <li>useradd -m -g users sambauser</li> <li>passwd sambauser</li> <li>smbpasswd -a sambauser</li> </ol>  <p>My configuration file:</p>  <pre><code>    [global]   workgroup = WORKGROUP  security = share  share modes = yes   [homes]  comment = Home Directories  browsable = no  read only = no  create mode = 0750   [JanGrimm]  path = /media/JanGrimm  public = no  writable = yes  comment = Jan  printable = no  valid users = sambauser </code></pre>  <p>JanGrimm is the shared folder in media, so the path of my shared folder is /media/JanGrimm</p>  <p>So, I've restarted the samba service and then tried to map the network drive under Windows (10):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DKxfG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DKxfG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Prompting for credentials:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IWwer.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IWwer.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Connecting now:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8YYJg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8YYJg.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>After some time, it prompts me again:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k8UCJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k8UCJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It obviously doesn't matter what I am entering, it is just not working. For my tries, i disabled the firewall of the server. What is wrong with that? I just can't get around..</p>  <p>(couldn't post @askubuntu because of insufficient reputation to post pictures or even more than 2 links)</p>
