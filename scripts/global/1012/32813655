<p>I have been using a Mushkin 64GB USB drive as Debian 7.8 instance. The device has begun to function very irregularly, randomly freezing and such. I want to recover the device to access data stored to it in a MongoDB instance, but cannot even access it on my desktop machine. I get the following error after plugging it in:</p>  <pre><code>[10418.290449] usb 1-1.5: new high-speed USB device number 7 using ehci_hcd [10418.444922] usb 1-1.5: New USB device found, idVendor=174c, idProduct=55aa [10418.444927] usb 1-1.5: New USB device strings: Mfr=2, Product=3, SerialNumber=1 [10418.444930] usb 1-1.5: Product: Ventura Ultra [10418.444932] usb 1-1.5: Manufacturer: Mushkin [10418.444934] usb 1-1.5: SerialNumber: 00000000000A [10418.445631] scsi7 : usb-storage 1-1.5:1.0 [10419.443253] scsi 7:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Mushkin  Ventura Ultra    0    PQ: 0 ANSI: 6 [10419.444370] sd 7:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg3 type 0 [10450.111622] usb 1-1.5: reset high-speed USB device number 7 using ehci_hcd [10465.180319] usb 1-1.5: device descriptor read/64, error -110 [10480.352988] usb 1-1.5: device descriptor read/64, error -110 [10480.528949] usb 1-1.5: reset high-speed USB device number 7 using ehci_hcd [10495.597587] usb 1-1.5: device descriptor read/64, error -110 [10510.770314] usb 1-1.5: device descriptor read/64, error -110 [10510.946247] usb 1-1.5: reset high-speed USB device number 7 using ehci_hcd [10521.351883] usb 1-1.5: device not accepting address 7, error -110 [10521.424021] usb 1-1.5: reset high-speed USB device number 7 using ehci_hcd [10531.829601] usb 1-1.5: device not accepting address 7, error -110 [10531.830149] sd 7:0:0:0: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery [10531.830205] sd 7:0:0:0: rejecting I/O to offline device [10531.830217] sd 7:0:0:0: rejecting I/O to offline device [10531.830222] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] READ CAPACITY failed [10531.830224] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc]  Result: hostbyte=DID_NO_CONNECT driverbyte=DRIVER_OK [10531.830228] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] Sense not available.
