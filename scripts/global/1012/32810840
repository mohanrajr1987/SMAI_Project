<p>I'm running debian testing, <code>kernel 4.1.1</code>, <code>glibc version 2.19-20</code>. When I perform <code>access( ..., X_OK )</code> on <strong>any file</strong> which is mounted by <code>encfs</code> (version <code>1.8.1-3+b1</code>), it returns <code>0</code> (meaning its an executable). However, performing a <code>stat(...)</code> on the same file, <code>.st_mode</code> shows me that it's not an executable (which is the correct result).</p>  <p>Is this an issue with <code>access(...)</code> or <code>encfs</code>. What could be the possible reasons for this erroneous output of <code>access(...)</code></p>
