<p>I'm using Debian with ISPConfig for my websites.</p>  <p>I'm following </p>  <p><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/" rel="nofollow">https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/</a> for <strong>Debian</strong> security announcements</p>  <p><a href="http://newsletter.ispconfig.org/" rel="nofollow">http://newsletter.ispconfig.org/</a> for <strong>ISPConfig</strong> security announcements</p>  <p>Are there anything else that I have to follow?  Both for Debian and ISPConfig.</p>  <p>Note : It is so hard for me to follow all updates which available. I need only critical security updates.</p>
