<p>I have a table called <code>Person</code> and a table called as address now, </p>  <pre><code>@Entity public class Person {     @Id     private int id;     @Column(name="addressID")     private int addressID }  @Entity public class Address{     @Id     private int id;     private String address } </code></pre>  <p>Now I haven't established any relation between these two tables through the code. </p>  <p>So is there any way I can write a Named Query with JOIN between these two tables</p>  <p>for e.g. something like </p>  <p><code>select p from Person JOIN a Address on p.addressID = a.id where</code> etc etc. </p>  <p>I know how to write a join is there was a <code>@OneToOne</code> or <code>@ManyToOne</code> relationship existing between these two entities but unfortunately there isn't</p>  <p>P.S. I want to achieve this using Named Query not a Native Named Query</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
