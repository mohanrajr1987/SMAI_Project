<p>I do have an application which uses JSF, EJB and JPA. I am not sure about the architecture of the Backing-Beans:</p>  <p>I used to have all attributes of my JPA-Entity also in my backing beans with getters and setters. Is this really neccessary? I mean, I could even directly access the JPA-Entity from the JSF page ?</p>  <p>Approach with getters and setters </p>  <p><code>value="#{backingBean.name}"</code></p>  <p>Approach with direct access of the JPA-Entity</p>  <p><code>value=#{backingBean.entity.name}</code></p>  <p>I would prefer the 2nd approach because I avoid a lot of code duplication. However does this approach have any drawbacks? E.g. on validation?</p>
