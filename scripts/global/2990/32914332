<p>I have a spring batch project. I am using Atomikos JTA and DB2 on the backend. After processing few records I am getting this error. </p>  <pre><code>org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaSystemException: Connection has been reaped - calling prepareStatement is no longer allowed! Increase reapTimeout to avoid this problem.  </code></pre>  <p>I am using a AtomikosDataSourceBean and I am not setting any reap time out. According to API docs, default is 0 meaning no timeout.</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
