<p>I am working with Parent Child relationships and we have HQL query with where clause to filter on Child entity's fields. And also there are some Collections defined at Parent and Child which are EAGER fetch.</p>  <p>On runtime Hibernate executing multiple Queries and for first query where  clause added correctly for filter on Child entity fields. But for sub sequent Queries it skips the Where condition to filter on Child entity fields.</p>  <p>Result is wrong with more Child Objects built than what I am expecting.</p>  <p>Can I know why this is happening, and how to solve it.</p>  <p>1) Is it a way to avoid multiple queries so the problem don't happen.    I tried on this to define Lazy fetch, nullable=false, but still    there is problem.</p>  <p>2) Or how to tell Hibernate to add the where conditions in all queries.</p>  <p>My Object Relationship:</p>  <pre><code>Cat -&gt; Kitten  (One to Many) Kitten -&gt; Owner (One to One) Kitten -&gt; Vet_Doctor (One to One) </code></pre>  <p>Data:</p>  <pre><code>Cat1   -&gt; KittenA - Male   -&gt; KittenB - Male   -&gt; KittenC - Female </code></pre>  <p>And Oweners, doctors etc.,</p>  <p>HQL:</p>  <pre><code>select distinct cats from Cat as cats     inner join cats.kitten as kittens     left outer join kittens.owner     left outer join kittens.doctor where kittens.gender = :gender  </code></pre>  <p>When I search for 'male' , results getting both including male, female kittens, which is wrong.</p>  <p>Queries from log (something like this):</p>  <pre><code>select distinct cats.id, cats.name, cats.age  from Cat as cats         inner join cats.Kitten on Kitten.catid = Cat.id         left outer join Owner on Kitten.ownerid = Owner.id         left outer join Vet_Doctor on Kitten.doctorid = Vet_Doctor.id  where Kitten.gender = 'male';   select Kitten.id, Kitten.name, Owner.name, Vet_Doctor.name  from Cat         inner join Kitten on Kitten.catid = Cat.id         left outer join Owner on Kitten.ownerid = Owner.id         left outer join Vet_Doctor on Kitten.doctorid = Vet_Doctor.id  where Cat.id = 1; </code></pre>
