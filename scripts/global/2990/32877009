<p>We're using <strong>Sping</strong> <strong>Boot</strong> and <strong>Hibernate</strong> with <strong>Oracle</strong> in our app and in dev mode at start we set:</p>  <pre><code>spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update </code></pre>  <p>We have a JPA entity call <strong>Catalog</strong> and from it, Hibernate is supposed to create a DB table named <strong>CATALOG</strong> (if it doesn't exist). Apparently, there is a bug in <strong>Hibernate</strong> and instead of not-finding and creating a new <strong>CATALOG</strong> table, it reports:</p>  <pre><code>o.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.TableMetadata   : HHH000261: Table found: SYS.CATALOG </code></pre>  <p>This happens only with that entity/table and seems that the name <strong>CATALOG</strong> is confusing <strong>Hibernate</strong>. If we change the name it works fine, but we don't want to change the name of the table. We want it to be <strong>CATALOG</strong>. </p>  <p>Does anybody know how we can workaround that problem?</p>
