<p>Entity A has a table TA (ID int PK autoinc, f1, f2, f3).</p>  <p>Using JPA over Hibernate, we save a record to A. The ID field is marked as the Key. We have set the batch size to 100 hoping that after 100 records are saved to the repository, physical INSERTs will be invoked. However, JPA/Hibernate apparently INSERTs each record as soon as the persist is called, possibly because it has to set the value of the key field which it can only get from the DB. </p>  <p>This means when we have a PK which is autoincrement, it will not be possible to perform the DB operations in a batch? Am I missing some annotation/configuration that can let me still perform the inserts in a batch? </p>  <p>I do not need the entity to be managed after inserting the records.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Yash</p>
