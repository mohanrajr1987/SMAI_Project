<p>As the title described, I am looking for a database constraint that can make sure a new inserted parent row always has at least one child row.</p>  <p>Say I have a company table and a document table. The business rule is that </p>  <ol> <li>each company can have multiple documents so company table and document table is one to many relation; </li> <li>each company must have at least one document.</li> </ol>  <p>I would like to do the check in the database level so that whenever a new company is created, there must be a document inserted in the same transaction.</p>  <p>Is there such a constraint?</p>  <p>By the way I use MySQL and JPA so I am also happy to use JPA annotations to do the check if there is any.</p>
