<p>I am making an application based on JPA/Eclipselink and entities, and delete operations must be logical (attribute / column true or false) to keep a log in the database. I wanted to know if it is possible ignore rows of the database whose "deleted" is "true" in relations OneToMany or ManyToMany. I have entities similar to the following: </p>  <pre><code>@Entity public class Employee {   @Id   @Column(name="EMP_ID")   private long id;   ...   @OneToMany(mappedBy="owner")   private List&lt;Phone&gt; phones;   ... }  @Entity public class Phone {   @Id   private long id;    @NotNull   @Column(name = "deleted")   private boolean deleted = false;   ...   @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)   @JoinColumn(name="OWNER_ID")   private Employee owner;   ... } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
