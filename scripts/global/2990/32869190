<p>I'm using Spring-data-jpa with auditing.  I essentially want to "touch" my entity - I want to update the @LastModifiedDate and @LastModifiedBy fields even though I have made no changes to the object.</p>  <p>Essentially, I'm looking to make these two fields work as "LastAccessedBy" and "LastAccessedDate" instead.</p>  <p>Is there a way to trigger Spring data/JPA to write the entity to the DB (and hence trigger the Spring data auditing module) even if the entity isn't dirty?  </p>  <p>Or is my only choice to modify an audit field (ex: @LastModifiedDate) and then have spring override it with an updated value?</p>
