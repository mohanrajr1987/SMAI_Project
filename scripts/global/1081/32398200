<p>I have an applet which is opening by Java Web Start. Java Web Start uses applet viewer to display my applet. As soon as applet loads it opens a JFrame. And user interracts with the JFrame. Applet on the appletViewer becames useless. I want to hide the applet viewer window. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>When I set widht=0 height=0 on the jnlp file.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Java Web Starts gives error and does not open the application. (something like widht cannot be zero.)</p>  <p>I tried to call the belov methods on the applet but.  It does not seem to have any effect.</p>  <pre><code>setBounds(0, 0, 0, 0); setVisible(false); </code></pre>  <p><strong>how can i hide the applet viewer window?</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PfNBf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PfNBf.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
