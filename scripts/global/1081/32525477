<p>At the moment we have developed a system that can digitally sign documents using a java applet. However with the ban of applets under chrome we are looking for an alternative solution for digital signing.</p>  <p>At the moment the signing works the following way: </p>  <ol> <li>A HTTP GET is sent to a servlet to get the document that is going to be signed;</li> <li>The applet gets started, the digital signature driver gets extracted from the file system and the user enters the PIN;</li> <li>The applet gets the certification chain, checks CRLs/OSCP and signs the document;</li> <li>The applet sends a multipart post with the already signed file to a servlet in the system.</li> </ol>  <p>One alternative solution would be to import the certificate in the browser and use js to do the signing. But that won't be an user friendly solution.</p>  <p>Another solution could be to ask the user to download a run a program using JNLP that downloads and signs the document and automatically uploads it using HTTP multipart POST. The drawback of this approach would be it requires additional user interactions (the download action) and we lose browser http session, so we have to authenticate again.</p>  <p>Which is more viable? Can you think of alternative?</p>
