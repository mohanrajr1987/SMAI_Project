<p>I have a Java3D application, where the applet is embeded in a html file with syntax "<code>&lt;applet code="iiit.vlabdemos.science.science$MyApplet"  width="990" height="700" title="EPR"&gt;</code>". I am actually looking for the source files[ie .class/.jar/.jnlp files] of that applet in the application repository. But I am unable to trace it out. Is it that the applet is running form some server? Can someone explain what the applet syntax means.</p>
