<p>I know there is a security policy restriction that does not allow cutting, copying, and pasting between an applet and some other application in the more recent versions of Java.

Changing the java security policy file as defined here:  <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/kyle/entry/copy_and_paste_in_java" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.oracle.com/kyle/entry/copy_and_paste_in_java</a></p>  <p>is impractical when dealing with a distributed application that is used by 100's of users.    So are there other alternatives that can be done in code?   This is a signed applet.  </p>
