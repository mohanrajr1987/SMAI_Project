<p>Is it possible to install JRE 1.7 plugin on firefox 1.5 on RHEL 5 linux? I tried to install it manually by soft linking the path the jre to firefox/plugins/ directory  the plugin works perfectly for SUSE 12 fire fox 36 but not for  RHEL firefox 1.5.</p>  <p>My question is :do older firefox browsers support newer version of java?</p>  <p>I verified that the browser architecture is 32 bit and jre is also 32 bit. even it is not supporting the jre.</p>
