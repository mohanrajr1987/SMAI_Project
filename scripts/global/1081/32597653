<p>How would I go and add an image on the mouse coordinates when the mouse clicks? I have looked at this :<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19769061/adding-images-on-mouse-click-to-jpanel">Adding Images on Mouse Click to JPanel</a></p>  <p>But I don't understand it and am trying to add it on mouse click in an applet</p>  <p>And please don't say, "Learn some basic java first! and provide me with a link to some oracle docs", I just can't get any info from those things.</p>  <p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; `import java.applet.Applet;     import java.awt.Graphics;     import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;     import java.awt.event.MouseListener;     import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;     import java.io.IOException; `import java.net.URL;  import javax.imageio.ImageIO;  public class SHR extends Applet implements MouseListener{      int a;     int b;      @Override     public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {         a = e.getX();         b = e.getY();          paint(null, a, b);/this is the part i am having trouble with     }      @Override     public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent arg0) {      }      @Override     public void mouseExited(MouseEvent arg0) {      }      @Override     public void mousePressed(MouseEvent arg0) {      }      @Override     public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent arg0) {      }      public void paint(Graphics g, int x, int y){         BufferedImage photo = null;           try            {              URL u = new URL(getCodeBase(),"SilverHandRecruit.png");              photo = ImageIO.read(u);           }              catch (IOException e)            {              g.drawString("Problem reading the file", 100, 100);           }            g.drawImage(photo,x, y, 10, 30, null);     }    } ` </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, I don't know what I am supposed to replace "null" with to get it to work</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
