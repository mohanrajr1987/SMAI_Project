<p>I've been trying to figure out how to replace a Java Applet we use to quickly print invoices so it uses Webstart instead.  My question is, can you call a webstart java application and pass it a parameter from the browser?  As an example, once an invoice has been completed and paid, when the user clicks a print link, we call(ed) the java applet and passed it a link to the pdf print of the invoice and it would simply send it to the default printer without asking any questions.</p>  <p>Since Google has killed Java today, we've been moving all of our customers to Firefox but worried that it's only a matter of time before they make the same dumb move and we need to find a solution.</p>  <p>P.S. If there is a way to accomplish a quick print method without JAVA I'm all ears.  Been looking for that for years though so assuming it doesn't exist.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Glenn</p>
