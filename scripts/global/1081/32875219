<p>So I'm trying to get a forum-like webpage for my webpage class. The curriculum is just basic HTML and CSS. However, since I have some programming experience, I want to create a forum sort of page. But to do that, I need some way to store data after the HTML has run and retrieve that data later (like for usernames and passwords and such). The way I see it I have 3 options but none of them are working.</p>  <p>I'm really stuck here so I'd really appreciate some guidance or a some way to get the applet to work or possibly an easy way to get a php server at school that would be awesome.</p>  <p>Edit: I want to more focus on letting a java applet read and write files without signing it. Is there any way to do this? I put it on the site exception list, and the applet can do basic stuff, but won't work if I try to make it read and write files using data entered by the getParameter method. Can I get a sample that will do so?</p>
