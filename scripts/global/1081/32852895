<p>I've made a Swing GUI calculator app at the moment - wrote the code, mashed it all together into a runnable JAR file, and have a nice little icon to top it off too.</p>  <p>My question is this: can you embed a Swing GUI like that into a webpage, or will I need to modify it, or is it a completely different set of rules?</p>  <p>It would be that you could just go to the page and, provided your browser supports Java, the app(let?) would just be there.</p>  <p>I've read that the answer revolves around an applet, I think? I was wondering if this would have ramifications on ditching all of the Swing components I had built.</p>  <p>Thanks for any advice/approaches/answers provided!</p>
