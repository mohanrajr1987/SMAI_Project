<p>I'm attempting to run a Java applet in my program. This applet is not mine, the source code is unavailable and is heavily obfuscated, therefore I am unable to make any changes to the code.</p>  <p>During the applet initialization, one of the methods within the jar file is throwing an exception which prevents me from loading the applet.</p>  <p>Is there any way to make the applet ignore errors/exceptions, and continue initialization?</p>
