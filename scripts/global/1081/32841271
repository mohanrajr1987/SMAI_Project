<p>I just noticed that because of Java Applet policies on Chrome (<a href="https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml" rel="nofollow">https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml</a>... and almost the same for Firefox), mobilefirst Mobile browser simulator not working very well on all applet dependant feature (pictures, ...)</p>  <p>Now I figured out how to make the browser agree applet but even forcing unsecure settings (chrome://plugins/) not solving this problem (a disclaimer always appears when load the page before java execution, makes the page behave without applet)</p>  <p>The last disclaimer is a self signed message and can't get rid of this...</p>  <p>Is there a magic settings makes me find back that tool ? Better, is there a non Applet version of that tool ?</p>
