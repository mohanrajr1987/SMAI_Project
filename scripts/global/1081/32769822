<p>I have the following code, which I can run fine as an applet from within IntelliJ. How would one compile and run it from the command line?</p>  <pre><code>package guiModule;  import processing.core.PApplet;  /**  * Created by Taylor on 9/24/2015.  */ public class MyDisplay extends PApplet {     public void setup() {         size(400, 400);         background(0,255,0);     }      public void draw() {      } } </code></pre>
