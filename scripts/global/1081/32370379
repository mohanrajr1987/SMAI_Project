<p>I have 2 xhtml pages, one normal page with some data and button for calling modal dialog. Modal dialog includes second page with java applet ( tag). I've noticed that after I click submit button browser is freezed for a few seconds while Java is loading. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;p:dialog header="Page2" widgetVar="dlg4" modal="true" height="350" width="550" closable="true" resizable="true" draggable="false"&gt;   &lt;ui:include src="itemSigning.xhtml" /&gt; &lt;/p:dialog&gt; </code></pre>  <p>If I'm correct, primefaces works this way: when page 1 loads (that have some dialogs defined), every modal dialog defined in that page is loaded, right? Is there a way to tell modal dialog to load its content at the moment it is opened? </p>  <p>So, I when I press submit button, I would like modal dialog to be opened instantly and applet after I open dialog (and page 2 in it) so I can write some message to user like: "Wait for a moment until Java is loaded..."</p>  <p>I want to avoid browser window freezing for 2-3 seconds before modal dialog is opened (probably because Java is loading at that moment).</p>  <p>Is it possible?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
