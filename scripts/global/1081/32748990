<p>I am trying to debug client side applet with intellij, I have configured remote debugging in the IDE for local host and added the parameters in java console, now when I start the applet from local browser I can connect with the debugger, and even it stop in a breakpoint, but after few seconds (even if I do nothing),I get a message in the IDE console that the connection was disconnected and I can't connect again until I close and open the applet.  what can I do to make this work properly?</p>
