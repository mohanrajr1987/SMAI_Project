<p>I am working on a multi-module-Java-Applet-project. I already signed all jar-files which are created in this project with a certificate from Symantec.</p>  <p>The manifest of each jar-file contains (upon others) the follwing entries: Caller-Allowable-Codebase: *, Trusted-Library: true, Permissions: all-permissions</p>  <p>In my project I also use several 3rd Party open source jars (like Log4J and so on).</p>  <p>When I start this application with a browser I first see the expected information-window which is asking me if I want to execute this application (including my name, the Company name and the URL).</p>  <p>After agreeing, I get a RuntimeException: <strong>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError</strong>: com/inet/jortho/CustomDictionaryProvider.</p>  <p>Without the signature the application starts fine. I already tried to get rid of the jortho-jar-file and eliminated all passages in the source-code which are using this jar. With this attempt I got the same RuntimeException but this time with the Log4J-jar file. So, I'm quite sure, that there is a problem with all external jar-files I'm using (at least using them they way I do).</p>  <p>In a 3rd attempt I signed all external jar-files, but still the same result.</p>  <p>What can I do, to make this work?</p>
