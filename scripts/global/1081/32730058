<p>I am having an issue with applets, which I have been stuck on for hours. I have made a simple calculator applet that runs fine in eclipse. I have also made a simple html document (I have altered it more times you can imagine in efforts to make it work) which incorporates my calculator applet. The problem is, that whenever I hit "open with firefox" on my html document, I get the following error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nbStz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nbStz.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>Now, I understand that this question has come up before on the internet, but I have been searching through so many forums for so many hours, and I still haven't figured it out.</p>  <p><strong>I have tried many things in an attempt to resolve this.</strong></p>  <p>I have already tried enabling heck Use SSL 2.0 Compatible ClientHello format. </p>  <p>I have tried cleaning the Java cache by going to the Java control panel, clicking Settings under Temporary Internet Files and clicking Delete Files.  None of these things did anything. </p>  <p>I also tried saving the java class originally in eclipse into a .java in notepad and put that and the applet into the same directory, which again, did nothing.</p>  <p>And now, instead of my previous attempts of moving the .java file, I have moved the .html file into the src folder where all my code is, as shown in this screenshot:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/95pXY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/95pXY.png" alt="This directory is in my workspace in src"></a></p>  <p>This directory is in my workspace in src</p>  <p><strong>Here is my html code, which incorporates the java code:</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Hello &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;APPLET code = "myappletclass.java" width = "400" height = "100" alt = "Not working" &gt; &lt;/APPLET&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This is my html code after millions of revisions, so chances are that I have already tried out a different form of this(i.e. without the alt, or with APPLET in lowercase ... ) but I am completely open to all suggestions.</p>  <p><strong>Here is the java code that goes with it:</strong></p>  <pre><code>import java.awt.*; import javax.swing.*;  public class myappletclass extends JApplet {  private double sum;   public void init() { //started by the browser when the Java program   (myappletclass.class) is loaded and run by the browser. The programmer does not write a call to the init() method.      double n1 = 0;     double n2 = 0;     boolean successone = false; //keeps try catch running     while (!successone) {         try {             String fn = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter first number:");  //Whatever they enter will be stored in string fn             n1 = Double.parseDouble(fn);              successone = true; //wont go through while loop because is true  now!              sum += n1;         }          catch (Exception e) {             JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "ENTER A NUMBER", "Nu uh",  JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);          }     }     boolean successtwo = false; //keeps try catch running     while (!successtwo) {         try {             String sn = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter second number:");      //Whatever they enter will be stored in string sn             n2 = Double.parseDouble(sn);             successtwo = true; //wont go through while loop because is true now!             sum += n2;         }          catch (Exception e) {             JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "ENTER A NUMBER", "Nu uh",       JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);          }     }  }  public void paint(Graphics g) {     super.paint(g); //call superclass of paint     g.drawString("The sum is " + sum, 25, 25); } } </code></pre>  <p>At this point of time I am desperate to figure out how this works. Again, I have spent countless hours on figuring out how to do this, so I would really really appreciate your constructive criticism and feedback about how to display my applet in firefox with my html document. I am excited to hear from you, thank you so, so much.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT WITH APPLETVIEWER USING COMMAND PROMPT</strong></p>  <p>I got it to work with appletviewer, but the whole point of me doing this was to see what it would look like in a real browser like firefox, with all my html and all. Instead, I got the same result as I would have got by just running it in eclipse.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4PPHC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4PPHC.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
