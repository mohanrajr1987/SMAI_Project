<p>We have an applet that performs file validations in our application. The user selects a File (size about 280 Mb) and the applet executes a lot of validations; the advantage here is that the applet executes the validations client-side, so the file is not uploaded to the server. If the validation is okay, the user clicks an upload button and the file is uploaded to the server.</p>  <p>The problem is that applets are not supported for the newest browsers, so we need an upgrade of our application.</p>  <p>How can we access the user file system from the browser without using an applet?</p>
