<p>I want to create two windows by using just one single sketch in Processing.</p>  <p>What I'm trying to do is that if I click a button in one window, then some image appear in another window.</p>  <p>I've searched Google and found some examples. Actually, I found the same question in this 'stack overflow web'. Here are the links.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20730901/create-more-than-one-window-of-a-single-sketch-in-processing">Create more than one window of a single sketch in Processing</a> <a href="http://forum.processing.org/one/topic/multiple-windows-2-4-2011.html" rel="nofollow">http://forum.processing.org/one/topic/multiple-windows-2-4-2011.html</a></p>  <p>Here is the codes of second links.</p>  <pre><code>import java.awt.Frame; PFrame f; secondApplet s; //f = new PFrame(); void setup() {  size(320, 240);  f = new PFrame(); }  void draw() {   background(255,0,0);    fill(255);    rect(10,10,frameCount%0,10);    s.background(0, 0, 255);    s.fill(100);    s.rect(10,20,frameCount%0,10);    s.redraw(); }  public class PFrame extends Frame{     public PFrame() {         setBounds(100,100,400,300);         s = new secondApplet();         add(s);         s.init();         show();     } }  public class secondApplet extends PApplet {     public void setup() {         size(400, 300);         noLoop();     }      public void draw() {     } }  </code></pre>  <p>But when I run this codes, I get the following error message at <strong><em>add(s)</em></strong>;.</p>  <p><strong><em>The method add(Component) in the type Container is not applicable for the arguments (multi_window_test.secondApplet)</em></strong></p>  <p>Code of first comment of first link is similar, but when I run this code, I get the same error message.</p>  <p>Other example codes that I found are all similar. They all create PFrame class and secondApplet which extends PApplet. They said these codes works well but I can't run these codes.</p>  <p>I couldn't find the reason of my error message. Other people seems to have no problem when running this example code except me.  If someone knows the solution, please help me.</p>  <p>Also, if there is a other simple way to create multi-windows in one sketch, please let me know.</p>
