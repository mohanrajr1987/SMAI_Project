<p>With NPAPI being faced out by Chrome, We've been trying to find a good alternative to an Applet we had for printing checks and invoices. There are many options, like NaCl and PNaCl from chrome (with PPAPI) however those really mean settling for chrome, which isn't a really good idea. Jumping from solution to solution we've found that it is possible to print absolute positions from HTML, like so:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html style="font-family: courier new; font-size: 11pt;"&gt; &lt;body&gt;     &lt;div style="position:absolute; left:129mm; top:25mm"&gt;&lt;&lt;**.***,**&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- PLC_POSICIONMTO --&gt;     &lt;div style="position:absolute; left:30mm; top:38mm;"&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;??????&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- PLC_POSICIONBENEFICIARIO --&gt;     &lt;div style="position:absolute; left:40mm; top:44mm;"&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;**.***,**&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- PLC_POSICIONMTO1 --&gt;     &lt;div style="position:absolute; left:20mm; top:56mm;"&gt;?????&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- PLC_POCISIONFECHA --&gt;     &lt;div style="position:absolute; left:82mm; top:56mm;"&gt;???&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- PLC_POCISIONANO --&gt;     &lt;div style="position:absolute; left:mm; top:mm;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div style="position:absolute; left:mm; top:mm;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>This is an example i made to test if the position works, those attributes will come from a DataBase. It all seems to work, however when trying to print from chrome to a dot matrix printer, the preview looks weirdly zoomed in, and doesn't print correctly, but when I print to a PDF and then to the Dot Matrix (or from firefox) it works like it shoul (somewhat). The page design in the Chrome Preview looks weird too, when the page is in portrait mode, it lookes squared, but in landscape mode it lookes as it should in vertical (and it seems to work fine until i print, where it prints as in landscape mode and not like the preview shows). </p>  <p>Does anybody have any idea why this is happening?. Or is there another solution that doesn't force me to use chrome alone as he company's browser?. </p>
