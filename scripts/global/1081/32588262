<p>I have a Java applet in my web application that I startup by setting the innerHTML of a div element with a applet element. It starts the applet and executes the code within the applet. The problem is that while it executes the applet code (start method) the browser (IE11) freezes and gives the message "domain.com is not responding due to a long-running script" and a button next to it that allows the user to stop the script. If the user waits long enough the message disappears and the applet code is executed fine. I never had this issue before and the application is running for some time (2 years) now. Anyone knows what the problem might be?</p>
