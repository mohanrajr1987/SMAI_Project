<p><a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/sonihal#!/vizhome/LocalBusinessRatings/BusinessRatings" rel="nofollow">First workbook on Public Tableau</a> allows user to hover or select datapoints on two separate maps, and other panels react accordingly (refer to tab <code>Business Ratings</code>)</p>  <p>Two maps are filtered separately, i.e. businesses in Brooklyn are selected in Brooklyn map, businesses in Ludhiana are selected in Ludhiana map, and it worked really well .... so far</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gPpme.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gPpme.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/sonihal#!/vizhome/LocalBusinessRatings-Grade/BusinessRatings" rel="nofollow">Second workbook on Public Tableau</a> adds action to <code>Grade</code> panel. If user hovers over a business, only that business should display on one of the maps.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cfswj.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cfswj.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But the problem, it displays on BOTH maps, which is what I don't want. And when I check the Location(Location) filter, it selects ALL locations, instead of the ones I specified. It's as if adding action to <code>Grade</code> totally wiped out my efforts.</p>  <p>How do I fix this?</p>
