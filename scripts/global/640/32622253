<p>Im trying to create a web app that needs to use an interactive map as part of the program. Is there an easy way to make a US map that I would be able to pin under individual states and such? the Google map API seems to include everything and don't really know if i would be able to use something like that for a personal web app. Something to the extent of the image link, it's from a mobile app but the way it is set up and presented is something I am looking for. <a href="http://www.gamezebo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/madden-mobile-events.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamezebo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/madden-mobile-events.jpg</a> </p>
