<p>I have some data I would like to represent at the US state and city level.</p>  <p>So I would like the map to start out showing the US, with a number associated with each state.</p>  <p>When a user clicks on a state, the map will zoom into that state and show numbers associated with each city.</p>  <p>I was surprised to find that there don't seem to be any mapping libraries which support this sort of thing. I would have to integrate the boundary data and write the behavior myself. It seems like this would be a pretty common problem to solve, so maybe I am searching with the wrong keywords. (On that note, please feel free to recommend different tags or title for this question)</p>
