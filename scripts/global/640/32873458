<p>I just started using googleVis in R, and am running into some trouble. I want to make a choropleth map of the departments of Honduras; here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>map_me &lt;- data.frame(prov=c("HN-AT","HN-CH","HN-CL","HN-CM","HN-CP","HN-CR",                             "HN-EP","HN-FM","HN-GD","HN-IB","HN-IN","HN-LE",                             "HN-LP","HN-OC","HN-OL","HN-SB","HN-VA","HN-YO"),                      x=c(0.47,0.32,0.31,0.25,0.24,0.41,0.40,0.38,0.43,0.29,                          0.17,0.25,0.33,0.17,0.19,0.39,0.21,0.31)) g &lt;- gvisGeoChart(map_me,locationvar='prov',colorvar='x',                   options=list(region="HN",dataMode="regions")) plot(g) </code></pre>  <p>In the browser window that pops up, the map is correctly zoomed-in on Honduras and the color scale in the legend shows the right limits (0.17-0.47). I think I have the correct ISO 3116-2 codes, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:HN#II-3" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia entry</a>, but it seems to be having trouble connecting my data to the map locations.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
