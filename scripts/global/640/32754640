<p>I had a developer create a widget using js that syncs video with corresponding gps data file and it has worked for ~4yrs, until just recently. I'm guessing it's an issue with the Google Maps api. The map shows movement in sync with video. The video can be either YT, Vimeo or private hosting.</p>  <p>I'll post more details if anyone is interested and has expertise in this area??</p>
