<p>I found this <code>Sample Code</code> at Apple's Developer Site: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/footprint/Introduction/Intro.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/footprint/Introduction/Intro.html</a></p>  <p>The discription says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Use Core Location to take a Latitude/Longitude position and project it   onto a flat floorplan. Demonstrates how to do the conversions between   a Geographic coordinate system (Latitude/Longitude), a floorplan PDF   coordinate system (x, y), and MapKit.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried it and it works really well. Basically, you provide a map image for a building and specify two coordinates manually. Then, using CoreLocation, it is converting latitude/longitute into (x,y) position.</p>  <p>My question is - how is it possible to grab latitude/longitude while indoors? I have watched some Apple's videos and they said they vastly improved CoreLocation, but how is my iPhone getting a correct informations?</p>  <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It works. I am just wondering how.</p>
