<p>My application needs a thread safe <code>Map</code> Implementation.  Many posts on StackOverflow compare <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> and <code>SynchronizedMap</code> and these posts talk about how <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> is both thread safe <em>and</em> has performance benefits over <code>SynchronizedMap</code>.</p>  <p>My question is: Are there any advantages of <code>SynchronizedMap</code> over <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>?  Why and when should we should prefer <code>SynchronizedMap</code> over <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
