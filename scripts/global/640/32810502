<p>I have image of the city, how i can get longitude/latitude for the points that i add to the image if i know 3 points like</p>  <p>Point1XRelative = "-18340651.0304568"; </p>  <p>Point1YRelative = "14945227.3984772";</p>  <p>Point2XRelative = "-3960915.94162438";</p>  <p>Point2YRelative = "-7933119.6827411";</p>  <p>Point3XRelative = "4901426.10152285";</p>  <p>Point3YRelative = "13585796.8781726";</p>  <p>Point1XWorld = "53.1186547";</p>  <p>Point1YWorld = "29.2392344";</p>  <p>Point2XWorld = "52.6341388";</p>  <p>Point2YWorld = "29.7438198";</p>  <p>Point3XWorld = "53.0900105";</p>  <p>Point3YWorld = "30.0548051";</p>  <p>I have algrithm that can convert only for the plane and when i convert from the long/lat to x y they converts with offset. Please advice me how i can resolve this problem.</p>
