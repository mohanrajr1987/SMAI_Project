<p>I am trying to print an R map with the following function (see at bottom) The input is a data frame that contain Longitude, Latitudes in decimal format and the errors that would be depicted as color bullet points.</p>  <p>This works quite okay but I want to add a new extra point, apart of what the data frame includes, that would have a different type (instead of dot, perhaps a cross or a square) and with a fixed red color, instead of following the color ramp I have for the rest of the points.</p>  <p>Can you please help me sort this out? Regard Alex</p>  <pre><code>dfE&lt;-data.frame(c(-0.1456250,-0.1442639),c(51.51476,51.51492),c(0.018878676,0.111847050)) names(dfE) &lt;- c("Longitude", "Latitude", "Error") stationaryPoint&lt;-data.frame(0.1422361,51.51516) names(stationaryPoint) &lt;- c("Longitude", "Latitude") data&lt;-dfE jet.colors &lt;- colorRampPalette(c("#00007F", "red", "#007FFF", "yellow", "#7FFF7F", "cyan", "#FF7F00", "blue", "#7F0000")) bbox &lt;- c(min(data[, 1])-0.001, min(data[, 2])-0.001, max(data[, 1])+0.001, max(data[, 2])+0.001) mp &lt;- get_stamenmap(bbox, maptype = "toner", zoom = zoom)  ggmap(mp, darken = 0) + geom_point(aes(Longitude, Latitude, colour =Error), data = dfE, size = 3)  </code></pre>  <p>I tried adding the below line to add the extra point with different color and shape to the ggmap line before but I always get an error</p>  <ul> <li>geom_point(aes(Longitude, Latitude), data = stationaryPoint, size = 3,shape=4,color="red")</li> </ul>
