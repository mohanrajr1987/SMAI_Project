<p>I am trying to develop an app that access HERE map through its API to get the direction route using transit (not drive or walking) on WP8.1. When I go to <a href="https://developer.here.com/native-apis" rel="nofollow">HERE developer website</a>, I didn't see the mobile SDK for windows phone. Is HERE maps API still support for WP8.1? Why can't I see HERE maps and its other apps (HERE drive+, HERE transit) in windows phone app store now? Has anyone tried HERE API in WP8.1 before? </p>  <p>The reason I want to use HERE maps API because the native WP8.1 map API does not return route in transit mode. Thanks.</p>
