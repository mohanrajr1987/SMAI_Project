<p>I would like to display localities' labels on Google Map without displaying the names of any native element(Districts...).</p>  <pre><code>{"featureType":"all",  "elementType":"all",  "stylers":[      {"visibility":"off"} ]}, {"featureType":"administrative.locality",  "elementType":"all",  "stylers":[      {"visibility":"simplified"} ]}, {"featureType":"administrative.neighborhood",  "elementType":"labels",  "stylers":[      {"visibility":"off"} ]}, {"featureType":"administrative.land_parcel",  "elementType":"labels",  "stylers":[      {"visibility":"off"} ]}, ... </code></pre>  <p>Some natives' labels remain visible even when I hide "neighborhood" elements. I was wondering if sublevels were available for "locality"?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
