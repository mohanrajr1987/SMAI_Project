<p>I'm developing an application using Gmap in c# (great API, btw), not to confuse with google-map API, and I did some really cool and useful stuff ever since.</p>  <p>My problem is that some of my clients won't have an internet connection, and that is why I need to be able to display the background (the map) offline. I used to use the property <code>GMap.NET.AccessMode.ServerAndCache;</code> to get my data from the server, and now I would like to be able to use <code>GMap.NET.AccessMode.CacheOnly</code> with a full cache.</p>  <p>Letting them load the cache with a connection to prepare for an offline use is not an option, the PCs will never be connected to the internet. After some research, I learned OpenStreetMap is the only open source map that would allow me to use their map for free (and that is good because they have very good maps). I downloaded a 20GB map of Europe, but I have no idea how to specify it as the cache (I know how to locate the cache folder).</p>  <p>Most of the time, my Google searches showed me people trying to create a virtual sqlite server with all the map's tiles in a DB accessed via localhost, but honestly I think this is very complex and I would like to know if anybody has an idea to allow me to use those maps offline or a link for the doc of this api, impossible to find on the net (I found the sources, but almost no comment and no explanation).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, and sorry for my bad English.</p>  <p>réponses en français bienvenues.</p>
