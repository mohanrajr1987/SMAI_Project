<p>I just started using Java, seems pretty straight forward. When I make a gps app with google maps on an android device there's no issue. However, I tried to incorporate an android wear device (Currently running on a simulator). My dismiss overlay pops up after a long click, but  the map comes up blank. I'm getting the map and it's not null so I know it's there. I'm thinking I need to use the handheld location listeners but I'n not exactly sure how to point them towards each other. If someone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it. -WD</p>
