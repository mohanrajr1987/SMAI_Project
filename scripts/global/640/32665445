<p>I have a <code>Map&lt;Integer,Double&gt;</code> that stores a key(<code>raceNumber</code>) and value(<code>speed</code>) such that:</p>  <pre><code>race1     speed1 race2     speed2 race3     speed3 ... </code></pre>  <p>I'm currently using the <code>for(raceNumber : map.keySet())</code> method to iterate through the map, but I'm stuck because I need to calculate the difference between <code>speed2 - speed1</code>. How would I go about doing that?</p>
