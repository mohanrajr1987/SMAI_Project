<p>Is there any Map SDK I can use specifically for iOS than can show me the North Pole kinda like in a globe manner rather than a flat map like Google Maps?</p>  <p>I need to show the North Pole like this to the user: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GKimp.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GKimp.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And not like this which is typically what other Map SDKs are which is flat: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QET9E.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QET9E.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Reason I need this is because I need to plot points that goes around the north pole or Arctic ocean. Problem with using a flat map is it doesn't actually show it properly. Say for example from one point to another in the Arctic Ocean, the line would be plotted from South-West and would continue to North-East line.</p>
