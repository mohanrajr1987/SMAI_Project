<p>I used the google maps API to integrate google maps into my website, however the api has a small white border that I can't seem to erase. I could fix this using z index but I don't want to do that. Increasing the height of the div doesn't help either. How can I get rid of this border?</p>  <p>img: <a href="http://imgur.com/nPRm355" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/nPRm355</a></p>
