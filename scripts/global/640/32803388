<p>I need to quickly get a location from my user in the android app.</p>  <p>I was going to use the maps API but then I looked into the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/" rel="nofollow">Places API</a>.</p>  <p>The Places API is really perfect for me except for one thing; I can't change the maptype.</p>  <p>At the moment it only shows the map and the API is very simple with just an intent builder basically. I'm playing around with the extras in the intent but it doesn't seem to be working, I can't find any docs for what I'm trying to do.</p>  <p>The users in the country I am making this for do not use road names and will be able to better identify the correct position with a satellite image.</p>  <p>With the google maps api I can use GoogleMap.MAP_TYPE_SATELLITE in maptype but I don't see that option with places API. Can anyone help?</p>
