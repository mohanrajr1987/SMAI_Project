<p>Wondered if anyone could help on this. Developing a Windows phone 8.1 app with Visual Studio 2015 and trying to disable the rotate. I've currently "disabled" it using the heading changed event and resetting the heading back to 0. Current control looks like: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;Maps:MapControl Grid.Row="1"  Background="Black" Holding="MainMap_Holding"  Heading="0" HeadingChanged="MainMap_HeadingChanged" x:Name="MainMap"  MapServiceToken="{StaticResource MapServiceTokenString}" MapTapped="MainMap_MapTapped" &gt; </code></pre>  <p>The issue with this method is it causes the map to just jump back which doesn't look the best. </p>  <p>I've tried using the 'ManipulationMode', however even setting ManipulationMode="None" does absolutely nothing and the map still functions as normal. I'd think the "proper" way to do this would have been using manipulation mode if it was working, however it seems not to be. </p>  <p>Any suggestions to stop map rotation would be greatly received. </p>
