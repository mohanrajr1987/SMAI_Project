<p>When I run <code>manage.py makemessages</code> I found some messages which were in the <code>.po</code> file like this:</p>  <pre><code>msgid "Example" msgstr "Example" </code></pre>  <p>Transformed to this, after I ran the command:</p>  <pre><code>#~ msgid "Example" #~ msgstr "Example" </code></pre>  <ul> <li>What does <code>#~</code> means? Since the translation of those messages doesn't work anymore, I suppose it is a comment.</li> <li>What can I do to prevent Django commenting out (or "<code>#~</code>ing") pre-existing messages in the translation file?</li> </ul>
