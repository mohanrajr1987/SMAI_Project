<p>I'm encountering a strange issue with deferred fields in the Django admin. Here's how the model is structured. </p>  <pre><code>class LightweightManager(models.Manager):     def get_query_set(self):         return super(LightweightManager, self).get_queryset()\             .defer('huge_field')\             .filter(trash=False)   class MyModel(models.Model):     # ...     huge_field = jsonfield.JSONField()      lightweight = LightweightManager()      def delete(self, using=None):         # ...         self.trash = True </code></pre>  <p>When deleting a <code>MyModel</code> from the admin, the web server timeouts. In the development server it finishes but takes very long obviously. On the delete confirmation admin page, I get a related model 'MyModel_ deferred_huge_field' (the deferred field). From what I can tell, there's something unusual happening in the django.db.models.deletion.Collector. I would be grateful for your suggestions.</p>
