<p>I've tried writing some custom actions for my django webapp to select choices on my models, but I've not managed to update them properly.</p>  <pre><code>def make_starter(modeladmin, request, queryset):     queryset.update(categoryType=('starter','Starters')) make_starter.short_description = 'Mark as Starter'   class FoodCategoryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):     model = FoodCategory     inlines = [         FoodItemInline,     ]     actions = [make_starter] </code></pre>  <p>It appears but it doesn't do anything. How do I update the query set to have the right 'choice'?</p>  <ol> <li>List item</li> </ol>
