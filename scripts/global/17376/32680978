<p>In Django, when I have inherited models, how can I do to make promotion/demotion possible in the admin interface ?</p>  <p>Example :</p>  <pre><code># models.py class Person(models.Model):     name=models.CharField() class WorkingPerson(Person):     job=models.CharField()   # admin.py admin.site.register(Person) admin.site.register(WorkingPerson) </code></pre>  <p>So in the admin, I can create a person, or a working person.</p>  <p>But: </p>  <ul> <li>once a Person is created, I can't promote that person to a WorkingPerson (which would need to add a row in the WorkingPerson table without creating a new Person).</li> <li>once a WorkingPerson is created, I can't demote that persone to a Person (which would need to delete the row in the WorkingPerson table only).</li> </ul>  <p>Thanks a lot !</p>  <p>Olivier</p>
