<p>I was recently told that it's not a good idea to build a whole web application on Django admin system. While it took just a few lines of code to get a lot of CRUD functionality with no code depending on the models, I heard that I cannot easily open the interface to non-staff users and limit their capabilities (for example: which models they see).</p>  <p>This means that I would either have to fork Django admin module or create my application from scratch and I'm trying to find out which solution would be simpler. Is there any CRUD framework with authentication built around Django that solves my problem with least code possible?</p>
