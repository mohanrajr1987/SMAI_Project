<p>I implemented authentication management using Django auth with the default admin site but then I wanted to use my own AdminSite to rewrite some behaviors:</p>  <pre><code>class OptiAdmin(admin.AdminSite):     site_title = "Optimizer site's admin"     #...Other stuff here </code></pre>  <p>Registered my own models:</p>  <pre><code>admin_site = OptiAdmin(name='opti_admin') admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin) #Other stuff here </code></pre>  <p>But when I go to the admin site I am only able to see the models I just registered, which sounds fair to me but I would like to see all the other apps models in this new custom site including the auth's users and groups and I don't know how to do this automatically like the default admin does, pls help :).</p>
