<p>I want to create my own Group and Permission model. However, Django has its built-in models for this which are giving me naming conflicts on it's own model<code>Group</code>. I know you can deregister to remove it from this admin, but this does not help me.</p>  <p>What is best here? </p>  <p>Is it possible to use Django's own and models for Groups and add to them (i.e add more fields), or can I remove the built-in Group model altogether?</p>  <p>My user seems to extend from <code>AbstractBaseUser</code>. </p>
