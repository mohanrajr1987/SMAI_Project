<p>Is it possible for a model with many to many relation to a polymorphic model to display stacked inline forms (depending on the type of the child model) ?</p>  <p>Using the <a href="http://django-polymorphic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/advanced.html#manytomanyfield-foreignkey-onetoonefield" rel="nofollow">example from the <code>django-polymorphic</code></a> docs i'm trying to make the list of <code>ModelA</code> models to display as <code>admin.StackedInline</code> in the <code>RelatingModel</code> admin page, each with it's specific form.</p>
