<p>I'm developing a Ticket system. Each ticket can be assigned to a user. On the ticket list_display in django-admin I want to have a column that either displays the user assigned to that ticket, or a link 'Assign ticket to myself'. I know I could use list_editable or make a custom action to do this, but for usability reasons I want a link in the list_display.</p>  <p>models.py</p>  <pre><code>class Ticket(models.Model):     assigned = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True)      def assigned_to(self):         if self.assigned:             return self.assigned         else:             return "&lt;a href="link/to/something/"&gt;Assign ticket to myself&lt;/a&gt;"     assigned_to.allow_tags = True      # untested example method for assigning user to a ticket     def assign(self, user):         self.assigned = user         self.save() </code></pre>  <p>This is where I got stuck. </p>  <p>I need that the user can click on the link, which will call the model method assign() to assign the user to the ticket, and reloads the page so the username is displayed in the list_display.</p>  <p>I hope someone can help me in the right direction. Note that I'm just a Django beginner...</p>
