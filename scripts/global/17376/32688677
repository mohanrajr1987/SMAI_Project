<p>I have following model admin. I'm displaying custom field in list view.</p>  <pre><code>class CustomerAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):     list_display = ('first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'state')     search_fields = ('first_name', 'last_name', 'email')     list_filter = ('state',)     def state(self, obj):         address = Address.objects.filter(owner=obj.id)         if address:             return address.state     return None </code></pre>  <p>I tried above but it gives an error "list_filter[0]' refers to 'state' which does not refer to a Field." So I want filter records by state. So how I can do this in django 1.5?</p>
