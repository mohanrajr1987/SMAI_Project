<p>I want to add logging of admin changes in my django project. I've done some of that through LogEntry model:</p>  <pre><code>from django.contrib.admin.models import LogEntry  class LogEntryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):     list_display = ('__str__', 'action_time', 'user', 'content_type', 'object_id', 'object_repr', 'action_flag', 'change_message')     list_filter = ('content_type',)     search_fields = ['user__username',]     date_hierarchy = 'action_time'  admin.site.register(LogEntry, LogEntryAdmin) </code></pre>  <p>This is great, if I change some field of an object in my database, I can see log entry for that action. But in this log entry I can see only that "field was changed", and I also want to see initial and result value of this field. How can I achieve this functionality?</p>
