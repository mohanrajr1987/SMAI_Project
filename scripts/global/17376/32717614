<p>I would like to create an action on the django admin interface that allows a file to be selected and opened, then processed (with the end result of this processing to be saved down). I didn't know how to do this within an admin action, so I worked around it by adding an optional file field onto the model that the action is associated with, but this seems clumsy and wasteful.</p>  <p>How would I go about prompting the user to select a file after clicking on an admin action?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
