<p>Let's say I have two models, in different apps.  App Two knows about app One, but not the other way around:</p>  <pre><code># one/models.py  from django.db import models  class One(models.Model):     pass   # two/models.py  from django.db import models from one.models import One  class Two(models.Model):     one = models.ForeignKey(One) </code></pre>  <p>I also have <code>One</code> registered in the admin site:</p>  <pre><code># one/admin.py  from django.contrib import admin from .models import One  admin.site.register(One) </code></pre>  <p>How do I register <code>Two</code> as an Inline on <code>One</code>'s admin page, without introducing a circular dependency between the two apps?</p>
