<p>In my admin I want to put my custom view. When I click on the model name I want to redirect to the custom view not on the list view of the model:</p>  <pre><code>class MyAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin): def get_urls(self):     urls = super(MyAdmin, self).get_urls()     csv_urls = patterns('', url(r'^my/url/$', admin.site.admin_view(self.my_view)))      return csv_urls + urls  def my_view(self, request):     return render_to_response("my_template.html") </code></pre>  <p>I have registered the model with admin.</p>  <p>I see the model name but when I click on it, it's not being redirected to my url to show my view. It is being redirected to normal list view.</p>  <p>How can I redirect my it to my view ? Thanks in advance</p>
