<p>Trying to create a super user for my database:</p>  <pre><code>manage.py createsuperuser </code></pre>  <p>Getting a sad recursive message:</p>  <p><em>Superuser creation skipped due to not running in a TTY. You can run <code>manage.py createsuperuser</code> in your project to create one manually.</em></p>  <p>Seriously Django? Seriously?</p>  <p>The only information I found for this was the one listed above but it didn't work: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26980003/unable-to-create-superuser-in-django-due-to-not-working-in-tty">Unable to create superuser in django due to not working in TTY</a></p>  <p>And this other one here, which is basically the same: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14059573/cant-create-super-user-django">Can&#39;t Create Super User Django</a></p>
