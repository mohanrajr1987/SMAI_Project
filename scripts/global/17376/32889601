<p>I have a django project with a model that looks like:</p>  <pre><code>class Profile(models.Model):     #some other stuff     owner = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)     last_modified = models.DateTimeField(default = timezone.now)      def __unicode__(self):         return self.owner.name     __unicode__.admin_order_field = 'owner__last_name' </code></pre>  <p>My model admin looks something like:</p>  <pre><code>class ProfileAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):     ordering = ['-last_modified']     list_display = ['__unicode__', 'last_modified'] </code></pre>  <p>I would like for the admin to be sorted by <code>last_modified</code> by default (as it is now) but to be able to sort alphabetically by clicking on the top of the first column of the list display. I tried to add the <code>__unicode__.admin_order_field</code> line as described <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but that doesn't seem to have made any difference. Is what I want possible? If not why not?</p>
