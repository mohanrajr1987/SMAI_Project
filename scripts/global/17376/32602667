<p>I am a Django newbie and working on admin section of my project. Below is my code for models.py.</p>  <pre><code>class Shops(models.Model):     name = models.CharField(max_length=200)     description = models.CharField(max_length=1500)     address = models.CharField(max_length=1000)     location = models.CharField(max_length=100)     contact_number = models.IntegerField()     other_details = models.CharField(max_length=100,null='true')      def __str__(self):              # __unicode__ on Python 2         return (self.name)  class Shop_Type(models.Model):     category = models.CharField(max_length=500)      def __str__(self):              # __unicode__ on Python 2         return (self.category)  class Shop_Category(models.Model):     shop_id = models.ForeignKey(Shops)     category_id = models.ForeignKey(Shop_Type) </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to display option for inserting data in both "Shops" and "Shop_Category" tables from the single page of admin module as both of them are connected. I referred <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18761996/can-i-customize-multiple-table-insertion-from-django-admin">this</a> question but failed to achieve what I want. Below is the code for admin.py I used:</p>  <pre><code>class ShopCatAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):     model = Shop_category  class ShopsAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):     inlines = [ShopCatAdmin]  admin.site.register(Shops, ShopsAdmin) </code></pre>  <p>It is throwing some attribute error saying that - "'ShopCatAdmin' object has no attribute 'get_formset'"</p>  <p>It would be great if anyone can help me out with this.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
