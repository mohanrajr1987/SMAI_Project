<p>I'm following the official android tutorial guide to create a context menu when a listview is long clicked. <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/menus.html#xml" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/menus.html#xml</a></p>  <p>Everything works out, but my contextmenu has a strange margin and the text color of the header is set to blue, which is a color that I never used in my app before. </p>  <p>I want to know where exactly the context menu is getting the information to set its margins and text color? It's certainly not the default settings of a context menu.</p>
