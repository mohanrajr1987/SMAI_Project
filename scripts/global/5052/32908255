<p>On the page <a href="http://www.voorlopig.eu/particulieren/" rel="nofollow">http://www.voorlopig.eu/particulieren</a> I have a mobile menu (max-width: 768px). For some reason, the parent menu items - who should be next to the + when you open the menu - are invisible. They are there in the code, but I cannot see them.</p>  <p>Tried everything, but no luck... </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>Thank you, Stefaan</p>
