<p>Right, so I am creating a theme for Wordpress and never quite grasped the entire way CSS drop down menus work. I understand them enough for some parts, but I cannot make them properly without having some wierd workaround margins and stuff.</p>  <p>I am currently trying to fix the one hosted on my website: yenrac.net/theme</p>  <p>My CSS: <a href="http://pastebin.com/3sVLGLR8" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/3sVLGLR8</a></p>  <p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
