<p>I made a side menu using javascript and when you click on hamburger a div expands and a ul changes it's visibility from hidden to visible and I want when the hamburger icon is clicked again to close the menu and return to how it was at the beginning how</p>  <pre><code>    function expand() {         document.getElementById("expand").style.width = "200px";         document.getElementById("menu").style.visibility = "visible";     } </code></pre>
