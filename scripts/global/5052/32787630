<p>I have a plug in word press I am using called zm ajax login &amp; register.</p>  <p>It has a login and register feature without going to wp-admin page to do those things. It allows you to stay on the front-end of the site.</p>  <p>The plugin has a link on the login form that says " Are you a Member", which is the button to get to the sign up form. when I click the button the sign up form pops up in the middle of the screen as a "pop up". I want to be able to have that button on my menu.</p>  <p>How can I add this same pop up feature to my menu, I basically want it to do the same but for me to add a button thats on this form to my menu</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="#" class="zm_alr_link zm_alr_login_link not-a-member-handle" id="zm_alr_login_are-you-a-member" title="Are you a member?"&gt;Are you a member?&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>you can have a look yourself at: <strong>advice.hughesjobs.net/log-in</strong></p>  <p>please help</p>
