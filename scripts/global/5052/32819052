<p>Hi dear Stackoverflow community.</p>  <p>I have an issue with my wordpress site and it's menu items. I seem to have reached the limit, and several posts suggest to increase the php_value max_input_vars, suhosin.post.max_vars and suhosin.request.max_vars in the php.ini file. </p>  <p>It looks like I do not have access to my php.ini file on my webserver, and trying to add this to my .htaccess file causes 500 internal error message. </p>  <p>What are my options in this situation? Do I need to contact my webhost and ask if they can change these values for me? Or is there another way of solving this matter?</p>  <p>Thanks for your time!</p>
