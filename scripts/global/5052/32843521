<p>In my html/css template I make use of an push menu from the left to the right side for mobile users. It works all perfectly but I would like to solve the follow issue.</p>  <p>The menu outside and pushing away the container '.wrapper' which both elements has the body element as a parent. There is a switcher on my body for me to know when the push menu state is open, 'body.cbp-spmenu-push-toright'.</p>  <p>The problem is when the menu is open, pushing away the wrapper for like 60% to the right, I still can scroll the wrapper. I would like to disable this when the menu is open.</p>  <p>What I've tried is;</p>  <pre><code>body.cbp-spmenu-push-toright .wrapper { overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; } </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't do the job.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help and or suggestions :)</p>
