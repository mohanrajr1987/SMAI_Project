<p>I have a menu with checkboxes (for example, Settings > Use HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 - 3 different checkboxes) and I want to make it so that when one checkbox is selected others get unselected automatically.</p>  <p>My idea was to use some kind of loop to go through each element and unselect them except the selected one.</p>  <p>I tried like this:</p>  <pre><code>foreach (ToolStripItem mi in settingsToolStripMenuItem)             {                   // code to unselect here             } </code></pre>  <p>But I can't figure it out.</p>
