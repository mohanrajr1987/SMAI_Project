<p>My idea is that, in order to provide to the user different options to choose it would be very interesting to include some type of IBOutlet with a drop down menu on it.</p>  <p>This is how it should be seen.  How is the best way to do this? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h9SxN.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h9SxN.jpg" alt="Drop down menu"></a> Any suggestion would be very appreciated. </p>
