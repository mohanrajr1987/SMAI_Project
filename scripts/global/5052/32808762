<p>I have a problem with my Menu. Firefox and IE seem to have different have a different take on how big an em is? I am left with a slight gap for my child elements in Firefox when it looks perfect in Internet Exporer.</p>  <p>I have tried -moz- 'css hacks' in order to change the height dependant on browser but this doesn't seem to work... I'm stuck for ideas.</p>  <p>Firefox (gap)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1EMNW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1EMNW.png" alt="Gap when viewed in Firefox"></a></p>  <p>Internet Explorer (no gap)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3STE7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3STE7.png" alt="No gap when viewed in Internet Explorer"></a></p>  <p>CSS code for changing height differential.</p>  <pre><code>.headerextend  {     -moz-box-sizing:border-box;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0;padding:0;     background: rgba(25, 25, 25, 0.7);     width: 100%;     height: 3.95em;     position: fixed;     z-index: 1; </code></pre>  <p>The "-moz-sizing" line of code was just something I got off another forum when searching for an answer that didn't seem to do the trick.</p>  <p>The drop down box height can be changed with the "height: 3.95em;" line of CSS. Depending if its set to 3.95 or 4.05 ems will determine which browser it will 'work' in.</p>
