<p>I have looked at dialogs &amp; menus, but still have no idea on how to implement them to create a pause screen.</p>  <p>I want to be able to create a pause screen with a custom layout, I do not want to use create another activity or use intents.</p>  <p>I have a method which detects whether the user swipes the screen left or right. Once the user swipes left or right, only then do I want the pause menu to appear. </p>  <p>This is the structure of my code:</p>  <pre><code>   public mainActivity extends AppCompatActivity{           //onCreate method contains the following statement...           setContentView(new GamePanel(this));    } </code></pre>  <p>Now the class which extends SurfaceView</p>  <pre><code>   public class GamePanel extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.CallBack{         //Several methods which pertain to the game along with a constructor         //InnerClass which is used to detect swipes         class onSwipeTouchListener implements onTouchListener{              //More fields              //Nested inner class              private final class GestureListener extends GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener{             //More fields              //The following method is called when the user swipes right             public void onSwipeRight(){             //It is within this method I want the pause screen/menu/customlayout to appear.             }             }         } } </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>I have tried the following:</p>  <pre><code> **//The passAsParameter argument is the Context of the mainActivity.**   public void showPopup() {              RelativeLayout layout = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.pause_layout);             PopupMenu popup = new PopupMenu(passAsParameter, layout);              popup.setOnMenuItemClickListener(new PopupMenu.OnMenuItemClickListener() {                 @Override                 public boolean onMenuItemClick(MenuItem item) {                      return false;                 }             });              popup.getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.pause ,popup.getMenu());             popup.show();         } </code></pre>  <p>Then I made a call to the showPopup method within the onSwipeRight method, however the desired pause screen did not appear. I have also tried using alert dialogs, nor did the outcome I desired occurred. </p>  <p>The fact that GamePanel is not an activity, increases the difficulty in trying to achieve what I want.</p>  <p>I am genuinely stuck on how to create an in-game pause screen, any help will be greatly appreciated. </p>
