<p>I am creating an application meant to run on windows 7. I have researched on the internet and it says that Windows 7 comes with the .net framework 3.5. As a result I have set the target framework for my wpf application to use the .net framework 3.5</p>  <p>Is it safe to distribute this application without publishing it knowing that the users will have windows 7 or latter? Or should I create an installer? </p>  <p>The application works on most computers but it crashes on some. Could this crash be related because of not creating an installer and running the application directly?</p>
