<p>Using Office 365 in Chrome works, but mailto-links don't, and for other reasons as well I'd prefer a dedicated mail app.</p>  <p>The installer did its thing and I restarted. The guides tell me to use the Office 2013 application icons, but when I start Outlook 2013 it wants me to set up my account ("Do you want to set up Outlook to connect to an email account?").</p>  <p>How do I set up my Office 365 account on Outlook 2013 on Windows 7? I have tried to enter my name, email, and the password that I use for Office 365, but on the next screen it never finishes the step "searching for  settings", so it never gets to the step "Logging on to the mail server".</p>  <p>PS. I don't think it's related, but my IE crashes all the #%Â¤ time, so I don't use that at all. This is a new (to me) laptop, for a new job position, so I can't say what the software history of the machine is beyond two days ago. :(</p>
