<p>I am trying to get a virtual Windows 7 computer to recognize my USB driver. I have a .inf and .cat file which I placed into C:\Program Files\My_Folder. When I plug in the device, the computer attempts to search for the driver by itself, but fails to find it (Driver Software Installation says No driver found). But when I go into the Device Manager choose Update Driver Software by searching in the My_Folder location, the computer is able to recognize the driver and install it properly.</p>  <p>So my question: Is there a specific place to put the inf and cat files? How can I help windows 7 recognize the driver automatically without needing to point to the folder with those files?</p>
