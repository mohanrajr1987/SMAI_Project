<p>Here is the simplified version of the situation I'm dealing with:</p>  <ul> <li>Folder <code>Files1</code> containing <code>a.txt</code>, <code>b.txt</code>, <code>c.txt</code></li> <li>Folder <code>Files2</code> containing <code>a.txt</code>, <code>b.txt</code>, <code>c.txt</code></li> </ul>  <p>I want to find the best way to compare these files. All I need to know is which files are different. For example I need to know <code>a.txt</code> is different from  <code>a.txt</code> in <code>Files2</code> folder (I don't need to know what is different inside them).</p>  <p>Right now I load  both in Notepad++ and use the compare function, but this is a pain.</p>  <p>I tried <code>fc</code>, but I'm getting cryptic output.</p>
