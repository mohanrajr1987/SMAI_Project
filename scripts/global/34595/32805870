<p>I've made a Cakephp shell that puts the weatherforecast in my database. It works fine when I navigate and launch it with Git Bash, but now I want to run a scheduled task on my Windows pc to launch it every 15 minutes.</p>  <p>After my scheduled task setup, I see every 15 minutes a cmd job running on my screen, so far so good. But when I check my database, no weather forecast records have been created.</p>  <p>I've based the action of the scheduled tast on the information I've read on <a href="http://www.geekyboy.com/archives/376" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. Unfortunately, they are using an older version of Windows and the scheduled task window is diffirent to set up.</p>  <p>Here's my current try:</p>  <p><strong>Action:</strong> Start program</p>  <p><strong>Program/script:</strong> "D:\Websites\BellewaerdeFun 2016\03 - Online\vendor\cakephp\cakephp\app\Console\cake.bat Weather"</p>  <p>I also tried many other program/script rules, but never succeeded. Anyone who has some experience with this? What am I doing wrong here?</p>
