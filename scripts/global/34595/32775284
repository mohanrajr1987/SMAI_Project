<p>According to analysis I have done in several forums I understood that customized properties cannot be added in Windows 7 and above to the property dialogue box because of different file structure.<br> Until Windows XP Microsoft used ADS, a feature of NTFS for storing meta-data where we can add our own customized properties to the dialogue box of property sheet.... and please suggest me if my understanding is correct? Is it possible to add custom tags to DLL property sheet?</p>
