<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xnP9R.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xnP9R.png" alt="Screenshot of Installer"></a></p>  <p>This problem only started to happen recently when trying to install/repair Visual Studio 2015. </p>  <p>"A setup package is either missing or damaged" and the package being something along the lines of <code>Win10_UniversalCRTSDK\Universal CRT Headers Libraries and Sources-x86_en-us.msi</code></p>  <p>Does anyone know how to fix this error?</p>  <p>EDIT: My current solution was to skip the package, not sure if I will need it later though, and how will I install it later?</p>
