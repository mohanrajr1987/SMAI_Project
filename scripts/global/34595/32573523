<p>I'm creating a new instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) in a Windows 7 machine as instructed in <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc816778(WS.10).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc816778(WS.10).aspx</a></p>  <p>The service account chosen is the "Network service account" and the currently logged on user(that belongs to the Administrators group in my local box) is given administrative permissions for AD LDS. After doing this one has the option to import several LDIF files e.g. MS-User.LDF into the AD LDS instance. Regardless of whether I choose to install or not to install any of the LDIF files, the wizard presents a dialogue to provide credentials for an account with administrative permissions for AD LDS. I provide the credentials of the current logged on user (which supposedly at this point is an administrator of this AD LDS instance), but the wizard complains that:</p>  <p>"The credentials entered are either not valid or do not have administrative permissions for this instance of AD LDS. Enter the credentials for a valid account that has administrative permissions for AD LDS."</p>  <p>Has anybody experienced this? Is there a known workaround?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
