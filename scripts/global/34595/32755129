<p>I am working on a machine by taking the remote desktop connection of my office machine but as I am UI designer I need the full resolution (as available on my local machine) in my remote desktop connection as well. But in the current scenario I have the Highest (32 Bits) setting enabled while taking the remote desktop connection but still text and images comes blur. </p>  <p>Can anyone tell me how to resolve this? Attached an example for the same.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Y0za.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Y0za.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
