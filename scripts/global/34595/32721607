<p>I updated my Windows 7 to SP1 for the purpose to install Visual Studio 2013. I am successfully done my job to install Visual Studio 2013. But the problem arises when I try to install SQL Server 2008 or 2008 R2 Management Studio. </p>  <p>The SQL Server service is not running in <code>services.msc</code> and the SQL Server Browser service is not even listed in SQL Server Configuration Manager. </p>  <p>Please help me because I have install SQL Server 2008 Management Studio several times and update it also to SQL Server SP1 but still not running SQL Server service in <code>services.msc</code>. </p>  <p>Due to this I cannot connect my database engine. </p>  <p>Providing I also enter the correct instance name several times by following the link <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960176/cannot-register-default-instance-mssqlserver-in-sql-server-2008">Cannot register default instance MSSQLSERVER in SQL Server 2008</a></p>
