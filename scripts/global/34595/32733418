<p><strong>My Question:</strong> </p>  <p>are there any differences between .Net 4.5 runtime on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008?</p>  <p><strong>Backround:</strong></p>  <p>My supply says that their client app is only supported on Windows 7. The app is coded using .Net 4.5 runtime.</p>  <p>We run the app in a monitoring environment using Windows Server 2008. The monitoring environment requires terminal services to work. The automated click tests are executed every hour again and work fine pretty much. Now from time to time we acknowledge "runtime errors" like timeouts, button was not enabled, object in use, ... . Currently we are not in the position to use a different testing monitoring framework with Windows7 support.</p>  <p>The supplier says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Windows Server 2008 is not supported for their app since there are   differences e.g. in .Net 4.5 threading model between Windws 7 and   Windows Server 2008".</p> </blockquote>  <p>I was not able to find any documenation on msdn to reprove this. The only thing I found is: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/vstudio/8z6watww%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/vstudio/8z6watww%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a> but did not really help.</p>
