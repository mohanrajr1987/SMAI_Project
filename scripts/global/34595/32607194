<p>I had an application build with the Python version <code>2.4.4</code>. It unlocks some features after reading a license file from the path "C:/filename ".</p>  <p>But it is not working while trying on the other machine with <code>Win-7 OS</code>, while working on other machines successfully. </p>  <p>Note: Out of 10 machines 1 machine is facing with this problem.</p>  <p>The file which it is directed to read is just a decrypted file created using the volume number of the O.S using py-crypto.</p>  <p>Can anyone suggest me to sort this out?</p>
