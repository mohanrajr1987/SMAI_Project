<p>I am using Windows 7. There are two folders with the same name "Temp", I can open them in windows Run by typing <strong>temp</strong> and <strong>%temp%</strong> respectively.</p>  <p>When I see the path of these folders, it shows me both name as Temp.</p>  <p>For "Temp": C:\Windows\Temp</p>  <p>For "%Temp%": C:\Users\MySys\AppData\Local\Temp</p>  <p>What is the difference between them? Also, I want to know if we use % as prefix and suffix for Temp because it has naming clash with another Temp? Are these folders available in all Windows versions?</p>
