<p>I have an interesting situation.  I have a fleet of trucks that will each have a Verizon Mifi installed in it.  Each Mifi will have an SSID such as "SysServ1", SysServ2", etc.  We have a total of about 25 trucks that will have these Mifi's installed.</p>  <p>Now, I have about 120 computers that I need to map to ANY of those Mifi's at any given moment.  I don't care if the Mifi's all have the same password, but I can't give the crew's the password because the Admin doesn't want them attaching their phones or whatever to the Mifi and sucking up company data usage.</p>  <p>So the question is this, how can I configure 120 computers to attach to any of a list of 25 SSIDs that might currently be available.  My thought was maybe there was a way to write a config for windows wifi that could have the password and SSID's stored somewhere on the computer so that when the computer is within range of an available SSID it could just automatically connect to it.  But I don't know how to achieve this.</p>  <p>BTW, the end user doesn't have access to the C drive outside their user folder, so I can put the file in system or system32 and they won't be able to get the password from it.</p>  <p>Any ideas or tips?</p>
