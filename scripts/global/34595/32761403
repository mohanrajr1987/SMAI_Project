<p>I have manged to sign up in a service. and this service only authorize with your public address, I gave the my public IP address, and I didn't find out that until It was too late, because some times my <a href="http://yvan.seth.id.au/Entries/2006/09/linksys-wag54gs-is-crap/" rel="nofollow">Linksys Wag54gs router</a> have some issues and  every 24-36 hours it reboots itself. and with that, It gives me a new public IP address, I want now to assign this IP I have to my computer as my Unchangeable IP address so, It'd give me this one every time I connect to a new network and/or my router reboots. </p>  <p>I found a lot of answers to my question by googling, but the problem is that they required giving a new IP address, and then It'd ( the one that they just give me ) be unchangeable, But It's bad for me since I can't 'update' my new IP. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
