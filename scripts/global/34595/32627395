<p>I'm trying to simply print out a "Hello, World!" message in Haskell.</p>  <p>Here's what I'm doing:</p>  <p>On a text editor, I wrote:</p>  <pre><code>main = putStrLn "Hello, World!" </code></pre>  <p>Saved it with the filename helloworld.hs</p>  <p>In Command Prompt (using Windows 10), I wrote the following:</p>  <pre><code>$ ghc --make helloworld </code></pre>  <p>But I get the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:2:1:      parse error on input `$'      Perhaps you inteded to use TemplateHaskell </code></pre>  <p>Should I import the helloworld file into ghci before trying to compile it? I tried it but still got the same error. Also tried including the file extension on the compile line, no luck either.</p>  <p><strong>### EDIT ###</strong> Thanks alot to Carsten, Fraser, Sarah and Jakub Daniel. The problem was with the $ sign. Omitting it solved the error and now I can compile it.</p>  <p>In case someone is having the same problem as me, ommiting the $ will solve the problem for both <strong>compiling</strong> and for <strong>running</strong> the program.</p>  <p>So instead of</p>  <blockquote>   <p>$ ghc --make filename</p> </blockquote>  <p>and</p>  <blockquote>   <p>$ ./filename</p> </blockquote>  <p>try</p>  <pre><code>ghc --make filename </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>filename </code></pre>  <p>Yep, after compilation, all you have to do is write the name of the file that you want to run.</p>
