<p>I’ve been given the task of changing all our legacy software installation packages to conform to Win 7 and 8. Previously our software would run on XP and Win Server 2003 and would simply be installed into the “program files” folder and run without any worry.  Nowadays, or since the introduction of UAC, installing into the program files opens up some issues regarding privileges when it comes to file creation, changing and deletion. Furthermore the whole wow64 redirection thing, where our legacy applications would be run from a different folder than the actual installation folder (Program files x86).</p>  <p><strong>Cut to the chase:</strong> Our legacy software is running on dedicated computers, only used for running our SW. I’ve previously bypassed the whole problem with UAC and WOW64 redirection (as a hot-fix-hack) by simply installing the software outside the program files folders.  Now we are looking for a permanent solution, and I was actually thinking of making my previous hot-fix the solution. So simply install our software on for example: c:\software\ and by doing so bypass the whole issue with UAC and WOW64.</p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are (if any) the pitfalls when installing legacy x86 software outside the program files folder?</p>
