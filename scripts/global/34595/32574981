<p>There are a number of StackOverflow posts about opening CSV files containing (UTF-8 encoded) Chinese characters into R/RStudio, in Windows. None of the answers I've found seem to work completely.</p>  <p>If I <code>read.csv</code> with <code>encoding="UTF-8"</code>, then the Chinese characters are shown encoded (<code>&lt;U+XXXX&gt;</code>, which I've manually verified are at least correct). However, if I interrogate the data frame to get just one row or a specific cell from a row, then it's printed properly.</p>  <p>One post suggested this is due to strings being typed as factors. However, setting <code>stringsAsFactors=FALSE</code> had no effect.</p>  <p>Other posts say the locale must be set correctly. My system locale is apparently <code>English_United Kingdom.1252</code>; a Windows code page looks decidedly non-Unicode friendly! If I try to change it to any of <code>en.UTF-8</code>, <code>en_GB.UTF-8</code> or <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> (or even <code>UTF-8</code> or <code>Unicode</code>), I get an error saying that my OS cannot honour the request.</p>  <p>If I try <code>Sys.setlocale(category="LC_ALL", locale="Chinese")</code>, the locale <em>does</em> change (albeit to another Windows code page; still no Unicode) but then the CSV files can't be parsed. That said, if I read the files in the English locale and then switch to Chinese afterwards, the data frame is printed out correctly in the console. However, this is cludgy and, regardless, <code>View(myData)</code> now shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake" rel="nofollow">mojibake</a> rather than the encoded Unicode code points.</p>  <p>Is there any way to just make it all work? That is, correct Chinese characters are echoed from the data frame to the console <em>and</em> <code>View</code> works, without having to perform secret handshakes when reading the data?</p>  <p>My gut feeling is that the problem is the locale: It should be set to a UTF-8 locale and then everything should [might] just work. However, I don't know how to do that...</p>
