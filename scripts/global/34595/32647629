<p>I have two Windows 7 Machines that are connected via 10Gb/s Intel Server Cards on a 10Gb/s Switch an a subnetwork(Physically separate from the larger main domain network). I'm trying to copy files directly from one machine to the other, but I only get copy rates in the range of 60MB/s to 95MB/s. Both machines are high computing work station with RAM > 20GB, multi core CPUs and each one running either a large RAID0 or a RAID5, so the bottle neck cannot be at the machines neither on reading or writing side. Antivirus software and Windows Firewall are disabled on both machines (for their respective subnetwork).</p>  <p>Auto Tuning is disabled.</p>  <p>Link rate is set to 10 GB/s (not auto negotiating)</p>  <p>Remote Differential Compression is disabled.</p>  <p>iperf gives me 9Gb/s transfer rate.</p>  <p>Files I'm copying are a lot of large (1GB) HDF5 files.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
