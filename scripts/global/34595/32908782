<p>This is what I'm trying to figure out. </p>  <p>I'm familiar with having a "Development" and separate "Production" working folders for a code base.</p>  <p>With Git however you can just have a "Production" environment and create a branch of it to work on. The problem I have is that I need the contents of the "Production" folder to be access while working on it.</p>  <p>What I'm looking for is to have a "Development" and "Production" folder on Windows network. All work is done on the "Development" folder then pushed to the "Production" folder. However right now when I have this set-up and view the contents of the "Production" folder the files don't appear in there just the standard git-init files?</p>  <p>For example: "Test.txt" existing in "Development" and "Production" folders. I want to keep the "Production" version live. I edit the "Development" version of "text.txt" and then push the changes to "Production" which over writes the change in "Production", when I go to the "Production" folder I then can open "text.txt" and see all changes.</p>  <p>Right now however when I push changes the file does not appear in "Production" just the standard "GIT-init" files that are created. How do I resolve this where files exist it both location and can push changes from one location to another all on a windows network?</p>
