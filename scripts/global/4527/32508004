<p>I am in the process of moving my Access database tables and update process onto SQL Server. I have been able to transfer the historical data and create tasks via SSIS to import the data regularly the issue is replicating the saved queries that were one in Access</p>  <p>For example I had a query that calculated multiple KPIs using SQl such as </p>  <pre><code>SUM(Case when ThisField = 5 then 1 else 0)) </code></pre>  <p>However short of creating a query in SQL Server and saving it somewhere I cant seem to find a better answer.</p>  <p>I had considered using SSAS, that way all of these functions could be predefined however as the majority of this is simply on 1 table that proved difficult</p>  <p>Other users will need to access these queries, before they were stored within Access and could modify as they need but I am not so sure with SQL Server, what option would be best?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
