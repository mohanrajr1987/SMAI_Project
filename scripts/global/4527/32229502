<p>i want to show this kind of output</p>  <pre><code>UserID  UserName 1  2  3 30 </code></pre>  <p>OR</p>  <pre><code>UserID  UserName 1  2  3 31 </code></pre>  <p>user data saved in db <code>select distinct UserID,Name from Userss Where IsActive=1 and order by UserID</code></p>  <p>and i want to just calculate no of days in month based on year and month name supplied by user. </p>  <p>one way i can do it. first i will create a temporary table and in loop add many columns to that table and later dump user data to specific column. i am not sure am i thinking in right direction. anyone can come up with suggestion or code sample to achieve it. thanks</p>  <h2>EDIT</h2>  <p>just got a function which will return no of days as per date. here it is</p>  <pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[ufn_GetDaysInMonth] ( @pDate    DATETIME ) RETURNS INT AS BEGIN      RETURN CASE WHEN MONTH(@pDate) IN (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) THEN 31                 WHEN MONTH(@pDate) IN (4, 6, 9, 11) THEN 30                 ELSE CASE WHEN (YEAR(@pDate) % 4    = 0 AND                                 YEAR(@pDate) % 100 != 0) OR                                (YEAR(@pDate) % 400  = 0)                           THEN 29                           ELSE 28                      END            END  END GO  select [dbo].[ufn_GetDaysInMonth](CAST('06/01/2015' as datetime)) </code></pre>  <p>so now my concern is to generate column dynamically with user id and name and no of months. thanks</p>
