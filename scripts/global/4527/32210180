<p>I have two fields which are both Datetime type:</p>  <pre><code>Date = '2011-1-01 00:00:00.000' Time = '1900-01-01 3:31:19.000' </code></pre>  <p>The '1900-01-01' is the default value so I am interested only in the time part (3:31:19.000).</p>  <p>All what I want is to combine Date and time together. So, for this example i want a query which would give me the result: </p>  <pre><code>Combined = '2011-1-01 3:31:19.000' </code></pre>  <p>I am using T-SQL 2005.</p>
