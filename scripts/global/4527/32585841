<p>all. My question is easy, but I can't solve it by myselft.  I have 2 tables: et_pics.ob_no where ob_no is user id and et_thanks_2014 where thnk.e_to is a link to et_pics.ob_no.  I need to find out ob_no in et_pics who absent in e_to in et_thanks_2014. </p>  <pre><code>SELECT pics.ob_no, thnk.e_to FROM et_pics pics  left join et_thanks_2014 thnk on thnk.e_to = pics.ob_no WHERE e_to is null </code></pre>  <p>This code works, but I thinks it's not the best way to solve my task. I've tried to solve it with IN predict:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT pics.ob_no FROM et_pics pics  WHERE pics.ob_no  in ((SELECT e_to FROM et_thanks_2014)) </code></pre>  <p>and not exists</p>  <pre><code>SELECT ob_no from et_pics WHERE not exists (SELECT DISTINCT (e_to) FROM et_thanks_2014 thnk) </code></pre>  <p>but both returns nothing. Why?</p>
