<p>I have an app that is connected via an apache server and a windows 2005 server. It runs well on a windows xp pc, but I want to transfer the database from that pc to another where I have wamp installed. The problem is I can't find the apache app so I can do the export. All I have is a www folder, from where the app runs. Any ideas?(I wasn't the genius that configured the app in the first place:) ) </p>
