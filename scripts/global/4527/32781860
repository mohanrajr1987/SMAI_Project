<p>I have tables <code>Cases</code> and <code>Degrees</code> with relation <code>Cases.CID</code> - <code>CDegrees.CID</code>. <code>CID</code> is Primary Key of <code>Cases</code> with AutoIncrement. </p>  <p>Both tables are used in one form and it's assumed that user can add new records to both tables same time and than save whole master/child data in one GUI action.</p>  <p>So in Dataset where I created FK I set "Both Relation and Foreign Key Constraint" to ensure during update of new record in Cases table, retrieved IDENTITY value will cause child records to update from -1 to retrieved <code>CID</code> value.</p>  <p>When I update <code>Cases</code> adapter, it causes to retrieve an new IDENTITY value and cascade update in <code>CDegrees</code> child record works ok too. But <code>CDegrees</code>'s update causes Insert script with [CID]=-1 (original value). I changed Insert parameter <code>@CID</code> of <code>CDegrees</code> to "Proposed" version but same happens (seen in SQL Profiler).</p>  <p>Actually my task is mach more complicated, I just simplified task to localize my problem.</p>  <hr>  <p>To describe more clearly. before update Both [Cases] and [CDegrees] have one new records with [CID]=-1 after [Cases] update both [Cases] and [CDegrees] have new CID identity value, just [CDegrees].[CID] "Current" value is -1 and "Proposed" is retrieved identity. But when I call [CDegrees]'s dataset update, it sends Insert Command to SQL with [CID]=-1 regardless that I specified @CID parameter source as proposed value of [CID].</p>
