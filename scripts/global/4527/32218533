<p>I have report, which takes <code>YEAR</code> as one parameter and I wanted to calculate the start and end of the financial year. Here is how I'm trying:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[sp_name]       @StartDate as datetime,      @Enddate as datetime,      @year as varchar(10) AS  BEGIN     -- SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from     -- interfering with SELECT statements.     SET NOCOUNT ON;       @StartDate = year(dateadd(q, -1, cast(cast(@year AS char) + '/01/' + cast(@year AS char) AS datetime))) = @year </code></pre>  <p>Is this the correct way to do this?</p>  <p>I need financial start date as 1-July-2014 to 30-June-2015, if year entered as 2015.Please note that, this I need internally to be calculated in script. If I'm doing something wrong, how can I correct this to get desired results?</p>
