<p>Thanks to <strong>domenicr</strong> now I see, that bcp keys are case sensetive. But another problem appears - bcp asks me about type of the field to write in file each time i run script - is it possible to automate that?</p>  <pre><code>Enter the file storage type of field Employee_ID [char]: </code></pre>  <p>I need to export data from view to csv file. The easiest way, as it seems to me is BCP. I tried to read MSDN <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162802.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162802.aspx</a> for syntax help, but I can't makes bcp to create file cause of error (running bcp from cmd). Thanks in advance for any help with syntacsis. </p>  <pre><code>bcp [base_name].[dbo].[all_users_for_ad] out 1.csv -t -c -u mylogin -p mypassword -s mysever   bcp:  unknown option u usage: bcp {dbtable | query} {in | out | queryout | format} datafile   [-m maxerrors]            [-f formatfile]          [-e errfile]   [-F firstrow]             [-L lastrow]             [-b batchsize]   [-n native type]          [-c character type]      [-w wide character type]   [-N keep non-text native] [-V file format version] [-q quoted identifier]   [-C code page specifier]  [-t field terminator]    [-r row terminator]   [-i inputfile]            [-o outfile]             [-a packetsize]   [-S server name]          [-U username]            [-P password]   [-T trusted connection]   [-v version]             [-R regional enable]   [-k keep null values]     [-E keep identity values]   [-h "load hints"]         [-x generate xml format file] </code></pre>
