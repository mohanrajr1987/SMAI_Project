<p>I have a file with the stock information, such as ticker and stock price.  The file was loaded to database table using freebcp.  The stock price format in the file is like: 23.125.  The stock price data type in database table is [decimal](28, 2).  freebcp loaded the data to the table without any problem by ignoring the last digit: 23.12 was loaded to the table column of the record.  We are now using Microsoft SQL Server's bcp utility (Version: 11.0 ) to load the data.  However we now encounter an issue:  bcp considers loading 23.125 to decimal(28.2) is an error (#@ Row 783, Column 23: String data, right truncation @#).  It rejected the record.  </p>  <p>I didn't want to modify the input file, because there are a lot of columns in the file need to be fixed by removing the last digit of columns.</p>  <p>Are there any ways to construct the BCP or the Microsoft SQL Server to ingore the right truncation error?</p>
