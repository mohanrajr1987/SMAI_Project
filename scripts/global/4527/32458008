<p>I have a query which runs and I would like to return records where the date is greater than or equal to a particular date. The column I'm querying against is datetime format.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT COUNT(RSO_ParentID), AssignedDateTime FROM Task WHERE OwnerTeam='2nd Line Support' AND AssignedDateTime&gt;='2015-09-01 00:00:00.000' GROUP BY AssignedDateTime </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way of having filtering on the date part of AssignedDateTime, and searching relative to the current date (i.e. search for the previous 7 days)?</p>  <p>Thanks, Matt</p>
