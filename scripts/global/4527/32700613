<p>I have a table with a member's name, address, etc. and a time stamp of the last time the record was updated.  I have a second table that holds updates to the member record, a holding table, until changes are approved by staff.</p>  <p>I have a query that returns data from the member table.  I now need to check the updates table, and if the member's record in the updates table has a more recent time stamp, return that record instead of the record in the member table.</p>  <p>I tried a few things such as a <code>UNION</code> with <code>Top 1</code> but it's not quite right.  I could make a complex <code>CASE</code> statement but is that going to perform well?</p>  <p>It sounds simple, get the most recent record from table A, and the most recent from table B and return the one record that is the newest.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT name, address, city, state, zipcode, time_stamp FROM Member WHERE ID = 123  SELECT name, address, city, state, zipcode, time_stamp FROM MemberUpdates WHERE ID = 123 </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>OK, with the help so far, I was able to get the results I expected.  Then, I went to add the extra where clauses and I broke it.  Tried several different ways including using a CTE and could not quite get it right.  Here is a query that works and returns the expected results, however notice I have to pass name_last/birth_year/memNum twice.  Is there a better way?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT TOP 1 m.abn,             m.aliases,             m.birth_year,             m.user_stamp,               q.updatePending,             q.name_first,             q.name_last,             q.company,             q.address1,             q.mailing_address,             q.city,             q.state,             q.zipcode,             q.email_address  FROM (                         SELECT  TOP 1                                1 AS updatePending,                              a.entity_number,                             a.name_first,                             a.name_last,                             NULLIF(LTRIM(RTRIM(                             LTRIM(RTRIM(ISNULL(a.company, ''))) +                             LTRIM(RTRIM(ISNULL(a.firm_name, ''))))),'') AS company,                             a.address1,                             a.mailing_address,                             a.city,                             a.state,                             a.zip_code AS zipcode,                             a.internet_address AS email_address,                             a.time_stamp             FROM        statebar.dbo.STAGING_Address_Change_Request a                 INNER JOIN Member m ON m.entity_number = a.entity_number             WHERE       a.entity_number = (     SELECT m.entity_number     FROM Member m         INNER JOIN  Named_Entity ne ON  (ne.entity_number = m.entity_number)     WHERE   ne.name_last = 'jones'         AND m.birth_year = '1975'         AND m.memNum = '12345'         )                 AND a.time_stamp &gt; m.time_stamp              UNION ALL              SELECT TOP 1                      0 AS updatePending,                     ne.entity_number,                     ne.name_first,                     ne.name_last,                     NULLIF(LTRIM(RTRIM(                     LTRIM(RTRIM(ISNULL(ne.company, ''))) +                     LTRIM(RTRIM(ISNULL(ne.firm_name, ''))))),'') AS company,                     ne.address1,                     ne.mailing_address,                     ne.city,                     ne.state,                     ne.zip_code,                     ne.internet_address AS email_address,                     m.time_stamp             FROM    Member m                 INNER JOIN  Named_Entity ne ON  (ne.entity_number = m.entity_number)                 LEFT JOIN   statebar.dbo.STAGING_Address_Change_Request a ON a.entity_number = m.entity_number             WHERE   ne.entity_number = (                                         SELECT m.entity_number                                         FROM Member m                                             INNER JOIN  Named_Entity ne ON  (ne.entity_number = m.entity_number)                                         WHERE   ne.name_last = 'jones'                                             AND m.birth_year = '1975'                                             AND m.memNum = '12345'                                             )                 AND m.time_stamp &gt; a.time_stamp             ORDER BY updatePending DESC, a.time_stamp DESC) q     INNER JOIN Member m on m.entity_number = q.entity_number  ORDER BY q.time_stamp DESC  </code></pre>
