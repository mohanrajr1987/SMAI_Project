<p>I am a beginner trying to create a dashboard using JS. I'm trying to present some live data graphically (using Google Charts), and need to fetch the data points for my chart from a SQL Server (which I need to connect to using remote desktop), and I'm not sure how! Help!</p>  <p>Another issue I've been facing is I cannot animate / customize my chart - I've tried using the following :</p>  <pre><code>var options = {        chart: {                         animation:                          {                         duration: 1500,                         easing: 'out',                         startup: true                         },                         title: 'Pick Monitor',                         subtitle: 'Updated every 3 Hours',                         colors: ['#0099CC', '#339966', '#99CC00'],                         is3D : true                         },                  width: 1000,                 height: 500                  }; </code></pre>  <p>The color hasn't changed from the default (red,blue, yellow) to the one's I've specified, and also the animation doesn't happen when the page loads.</p>
