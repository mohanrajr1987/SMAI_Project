<p>Trying to write a simple pandas script which executes a query from SQL Server with WHERE clause.  However, the query doesnt return any values. Possibly because the parameter is not passed? I thought we could pass the key-value pairs as below. Can you please point out what i am doing wrong here? </p>  <p>Posting just the query and relevant pieces. All the libraries have been imported as needed.</p>  <pre><code>  curr_sales_month = '2015-08-01'   sql_query = """SELECT sale_month,region,oem,nameplate,Model,Segment,Sales  FROM [MONTHLY_SALES] WHERE Sale_Month = %(salesmonth)s"""     print ("Executed SQL Extract", sql_query)      df = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query,conn,params={"salesmonth":curr_sales_month})  </code></pre>  <p>The program returned with:        Closed Connection - Fetched 0 rows for Report</p>  <pre><code>    Process finished with exit code 0 </code></pre>
