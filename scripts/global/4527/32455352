<p>I need a script that will concatenate the Reason values by PLAN_ID in a colon delimited string from the following table and place them in a further table, staying true to the Order value. How can this be achieved?</p>  <pre><code>PLAN_ID Order   Reason 6281    1       Declined 6281    4       Unfit 6281    8       Other 6281    9       Monitoring 6286    1       Declined 6286    5       Unknown Site 6286    10      Not Known  PLAN_ID Reason 6281    Declined;Unfit;Other;Monitoring 6286    Declined;Unknown Site;Not Known </code></pre>
