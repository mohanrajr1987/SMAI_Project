<p>I've been working for a long time with a SQLServer 2015 project, logging in with win authentication. (SQLServer 2015).</p>  <p>Today I have a Timeout on my connection.</p>  <p>Why? Today I've changed my Password on windows, forgetting the SQLServer connection. UPS!!! The connection fails and I've restored the old psswd... and the connection fails... mmmm?</p>  <p>Then I've checked my connections on ODBC (I have a couple of apps running), and connection success.... lol?</p>  <p>Then I've returned to SQLServer (I'm trying to logg in with SQLServer Management Studio) and the connection fails. .... OMG!</p>  <p>I am trying to logg to my SERVERDB from my SERVERAPP with Management Studio 2015. ODBC loggs in, but management Studio fails. Both with windows autenthication.</p>  <p>I am not an expert with connections (nor on english ¬¬), but this is so strange.</p>  <p>Someone may help me, I'm getting crazy about that.</p>  <p>Thank you very much. I've been looking on web but no cases like that.</p>
