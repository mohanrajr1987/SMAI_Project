<p>I have split a name value in one column to get the first and last name to supply in another column. Sometimes I get a quote(") in the front of or beginning of someones name. How do I remove that quote?</p>  <p>I've tried pragmatically but it kicks back error at the set commands for @fname and @lname. </p>  <pre><code>  DECLARE @fname VARCHAR(100)   DECLARE @lname VARCHAR(100)   DECLARE @recnum as INT   DECLARE @i as int   SELECT @recnum = count(*) FROM dbo.medcor_weeklywire   SET @i = 1   WHILE @i &lt;=@recnum   BEGIN    SELECT @fname = LTRIM(jw_employee_fname) where [sysid] = @i   SELECT @lname = LTRIM(jw_employee_lname) where [sysid] = @i   SET @fname = SELECT REPLACE(@fname,'"','')   SET @lname = SELECT REPLACE(@lname,'"','')   update [medcor_weeklywire]   SET [jw_employee_fname] = @fname, [jw_employee_lname] = @lname    END </code></pre>
