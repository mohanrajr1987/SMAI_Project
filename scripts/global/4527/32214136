<p>Just an odd problem...</p>  <p>Situation, my department uses SSMS 2012 to connect to multiple SQL servers, in multiple versions (2005, 2008, 2012)</p>  <p>A few weeks ago we had security patches sent to our PC's, and now a very strange issue has started, affecting all five of us....</p>  <p>When we connect to the SQL Server 2005 with SSMS, we can see the Job Agent. We can view the properties and History with no issues at all. We can edit various settings of the job.</p>  <p>However, when we try to right click a job and execute it with "Start Job at Step" (which has worked for years!) we now get an error.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo<br>   Start failed for Job 'DashBoard_Execute_Measure_Items'.  </p>      <p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>      <p>An exception occurred while executing a Transact-SQL statement or batch. (Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo)<br>   A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server.   (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0<br>   The specified network name is no longer available.)       </p> </blockquote>  <p>The odd part is that we really are still connected, I can open queries, edit things, save them, etc..</p>  <p>Just cannot run the job manually.</p>  <p>The jobs do continue to run correctly when called by the Agent on schedule. AND if we do a remote desktop login to the server, pull up SSMS on the remote desktop, then click the same job and manually run, it works just fine!</p>  <p>This happens for all members of my department, and for all jobs on 2005 servers. we can manually run jobs on 2008 &amp; 2012 servers just like always.</p>  <p>I now have several dents in the sheetrock next to my computer from trying to figure this one out.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
