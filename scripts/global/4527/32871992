<p>I'm trying to return data from one table A that does not exist in table B with certain data.  For instance:</p>  <pre><code>Table A     No_         Inventory Posting Group              1           PAR              2           NEW              3           PAR              4           PAR  Table B     No_         Table ID       Dimension Code              1           27             Branch              2           27             Manufacturer              3           27             Department              3           27             Branch              5           27             Department </code></pre>  <p>Every part No_ exists in table A.  Table B needs to have both "Branch" and "Department" on a separate row.  Some parts have one or the other or both in Table B.  I'm trying to return results that show for every part listed in table A which ones are not present for "Branch" and "Department" in table B.  It may be two separate queries.   Here is what I have now, but I'm not getting what I want.</p>  <pre><code>select dd.[No_], dd.[Table ID], dd.[Dimension Code], dd.[Dimension Value Code], dd.[Value Posting], dd.[Multi Selection Action] from [Item] i left outer join [Default Dimension] dd  on  i.[No_] = dd.[No_]  where dd.[Dimension Code] not in ('BRANCH', 'DEPARTMENT') and i.[Inventory Posting Group] = 'PAR' and dd.[Table ID] = 27 </code></pre>
