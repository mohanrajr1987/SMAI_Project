<p>I have a large set of data containing names, sex and the number of births. I have split my data in two using</p>  <pre><code>namessex = split(namesdata1950, namesdata1950$sex) </code></pre>  <p>but now I don't know how to access the top 10 names of each sex. I thought <code>namessex[1:10,namesdata1950$names]</code> would work but it just returns the following error </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error in namessex[1:10, namesdata1950$names] :      incorrect number of dimensions   All and any help is greatly appreciated</p> </blockquote>
