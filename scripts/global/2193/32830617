<p>Apologies about the (possibly) basic question, but I am attempting to split a string, and making one part of the string public, so I can call it later in the form in a different class. </p>  <p>It is a simple Skype chat bot, and it reads the message sent to me for processing. However, I am attempting to make it so that if someone sent a command with two words - e.g. !command name - the !command command will be processed, and later in the form, I will use the second part of the split string to be able to process it. Here is what I am attempting -</p>  <p>The splitting and reading of the message -</p>  <pre><code>  public void skype_MessageStatus(ChatMessage msg, TChatMessageStatus status)     {         if (msg.Body.IndexOf(trigger) == 0 &amp;&amp; TChatMessageStatus.cmsReceived == status)         {             string command = msg.Body.Remove(0, trigger.Length).ToLower();             var splitted = command.Split(' ');             string command1 = splitted[0];             string name = splitted[1];             msg.Chat.SendMessage(nick + ProcessCommand(command1));         }     } </code></pre>  <p>There are several other commands in this chat bot, so there is a switch containing different outcomes - as for !command, I have -</p>  <pre><code> case "command":  result = command();  break; </code></pre>  <p>And finally -</p>  <pre><code>       private string command()     {         WebRequest.Create("API I have" + name);         new WebClient().DownloadString("API I have" + name);     } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to be able to use 'name' here, from the split message. Thanks, and any help is appreciated.</p>
