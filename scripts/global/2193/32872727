<p>I am splitting the record using the delimiter '|'. Encounter a scenario where pipe symbol(delimiter) is preceded by escape sequence,in that case pipe symbol couldn't be consider as a delimiter. How do i resolve it using split? Posted below the sample piece of code</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict;  my $id = 'Hi|Hello\|Sir'; my @code = split(/\|/,$id);  print $code[1]."\n"; </code></pre>  <p>The expected output for the above program is "<strong>Hello\|Sir</strong>" but the actual output is "**Hello**".How do i handle the delimiter preceded by escape sequence using split.</p>  <p>Thank You</p>
