<p>I've got the following Problem:</p>  <p>I want to take parts of a string into an array. So far no problem (splitstring), but, I can't use <code>splitstring</code> because it takes my operators out.</p>  <p>Explained on an example:<br> Following string: <code>"47-62*5141"</code><br> I need it like this: <code>{"47", "-", "62", "*", "5141"}</code></p>  <p>If you could give me a code example, I would be very pleased!</p>
