<p>I tried doing something like what these people have done: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10631715/how-to-split-a-comma-separated-string">How to split a comma-separated string?</a> But when I do the following:</p>  <pre><code>String UserInput = new Scanner(System.in).next(); GradesNonInt = Arrays.asList(UserInput.replaceAll("\\s","").split(",")); System.out.println(GradesNonInt.size()); </code></pre>  <p>When I input a string like "1,2,3" I get 3 printed. When I type "1, 2, 3" I get 1 printed. For some reason, it does not want to work when the string has spaces in it.</p>  <p>As one of the answers below said, entering "1, 2, 3" directly seems to work fine, but yet when taken from the Scanner(System.in).next(), it is not.</p>
