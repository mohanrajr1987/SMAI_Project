<p>I am doing some string work that leaves me with some repeated-single-quote strings like:</p>  <pre><code>all''your''base''belong </code></pre>  <p>and I want to separate the string in between the apostrophes to get a list:</p>  <pre><code>all' 'your' 'base' 'belong </code></pre>  <p>Or, even better, that would trim each word of the apostrophes <em>unless</em> it has an apostrophe only at the end, so the end result would be:</p>  <pre><code>all' your base belong </code></pre>  <p>How could I go about doing this cleanly?</p>
