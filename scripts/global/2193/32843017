<p>I have a CSV file which looks something like this:</p>    <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Column1,Column2,Column3 John,Smith,"AA, AH, CA, NI, PB" Reginald,Higginsworth,"AA, AH, CA, NI, PB, SN, ZS" </code></pre>  <p>You'll notice that there are multiple values within <code>Column3</code> (enclosed in the quotes). What I need to do is produce a line of data in the CSV for each of these values in <code>Column3</code>, i.e. the file would need to look something like:</p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Column1,Column2,Column3 John,Smith,AA John,Smith,AH John,Smith,CA John,Smith,NI John,Smith,PB Reginald,Higginsworth,AA Reginald,Higginsworth,AH Reginald,Higginsworth,CA Reginald,Higginsworth,NI Reginald,Higginsworth,PB Reginald,Higginsworth,SN Reginald,Higginsworth,ZS </code></pre>  <p>I have had more than several attempts at this and can't seem to get it right.</p>
