<p>I want to split a certain string and store them in a variable.</p>  <pre><code>  GetID = "13H4"   sSplit = Split(GetID) </code></pre>  <p><strong>I want to split them and store "13" in a variable and "4" in another variable.</strong></p>  <p>I don't want to use MID,RIGHT,LEFT methods because I don't want to put a location of string to get "13" or "4". Do you guys know how to do it?</p>  <p>Thanks guys. </p>
