<p>I have a txt file with a list of email addresses.</p>  <p>so far, I have tried:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'sed -e 's|^*@||' file | LC_ALL=C sort -u > dnsfile'</p>      <p>'sed -e 's|^@||' temp.txt | LC_ALL=C sort -u > dns.txt'</p> </blockquote>  <p>These do not seem to print the domain name to the file. </p>  <p>Then, I tried this and it got the job done. But, I'd like to know whether there is a shorter way.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'grep -o '@.*' file > dnsfile | sed -e 's/@//g' dnsfile > dnsfile.tmp | sort -u &amp;&amp; mv dnsfile.tmp dnsfile'</p> </blockquote>
