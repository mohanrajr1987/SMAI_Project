<p>I am trying to make my grouped products in magento have 2 or more split sections like the bundle products where I can make a mandatory products field (which you can add certain qty's) and a optional field (where you can also add certain qtys). I would love to be able to have 2 separate tables with these but I cant find any extensions or similar to do this. Happy to buy a product if it does the job. </p>  <p>The products are a schools booklist - so it needs to have:</p>  <p>mandatory school supplies book pen folder</p>  <p>Optional schools supplies book 2 pencil rubber</p>  <p>If I cant have a table split I would be happy having the words or a flag next to the item but I cant just write it in the title as these items will also be sold for manyyy other packs aswell which may or may not be mandatory.</p>  <p>Any feedback welcome :)</p>
