<p>for example i have the string :</p>  <pre><code>"hello0there\\nhow3are6you1today?" </code></pre>  <p>what i want to get is :</p>  <pre><code>["hello", "there", "how", "are", "you", "today?"] </code></pre>  <p>the digits represent spaces, and the <code>\\n</code> is a new line. i've tried <code>split()</code> to do it but it can only get 2 arguements and not more, so it's not optinal.</p>  <p>i also found this :  </p>  <pre><code>filter(None, re.split("['1234567890']+", string_to_split)) </code></pre>  <p>which works fine for the digits, yet not for the <code>'\\n'</code>. is there any way to split the string by the digits and the <code>'\\n'</code> in one action? </p>  <p>i cant figure out a way to split it in two separated functions because once I've created a list i cannot split it again.</p>  <p>if anyone knows of a way to do so, please help me. thanks</p>
