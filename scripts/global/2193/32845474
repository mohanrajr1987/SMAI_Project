<p>just like the title already says: I want to extract a multichannel track (5.1) from an .m4v, mix this track down and save the output as separate files, so in the end I want to have something like 'downmix_left.wav' and 'downmix_right.wav' I know how to do a downmix and I know how to split the audio, but I do not know how to do it in one step, which would save me a lot of time. </p>  <p>This is the command I use for splitting:</p>  <pre><code>ffmpeg -i "video.m4v" -vn -filter_complex \ "[0:2]channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1(side)[FL][FR][FC][LFE][SL][SR]" \  -map "[FL]" video_left.wav \  -map "[FR]" video_right.wav \  -map "[FC]" video_center.wav \  -map "[LFE]" video_lfe.wav \  -map "[SL]" video_back_left.wav \  -map "[SR]" video_back_right.wav </code></pre>  <p>And this is the command for the downmix of a multichannel track:</p>  <pre><code>ffmpeg -i "video.m4v" -vn -map 0:2 -ac 2 \  -af "aresample=matrix_encoding=dplii" video_downmix.wav </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to combine these and if so, how can it be done :D ? I would appreciate it very much if you could help me out here.</p>
