<p>Is there any difference in the output of these two functions? I have a text editor I'm modifying on a website. The editor currently splits by character but I am switching it to split by a word or phrase.</p>  <p><strong>Split by Character</strong></p>  <pre><code>string words = "word1*word2*word3*word4"; string[] collectionofWords = words.Split('*'); </code></pre>  <p><strong>Split by Word</strong></p>  <pre><code>string words = "word1***word2***word3***word4"; string[] collectionofWords = words.Split(new string[] { "***" }, StringSplitOptions.None); </code></pre>  <p><strong>Do these functions work exactly the same even in difficult scenarios?</strong> </p>  <p>In my example above they appear to word identically but what if there was empty data (EG1) or what if there was characters at the beginning or end of the string (EG2) would these functions still produce identical results?</p>  <p><strong>Is there any scenario where these two functions would produce different results given the same data being passed in?</strong></p>  <p><strong>EG1</strong></p>  <pre><code>string words = "word1*word2**word4"; string words = "word1***word2******word4"; </code></pre>  <p><strong>EG2</strong></p>  <pre><code>string words = "*word1*word2*word3*word4*"; string words = "***word1***word2***word3***word4***"; </code></pre>
