<p>I know you can select bunch pdf files and merge them all together into a single pdf file. My question is, Is there any way to unmerge those files being merged together into separate files?  An example. I am give a pdf file with 10 pages which I dont know sub pdf parts. Is there any tool to analyze meta data and tells me the pdf file is a merge of subfiles from page 1-5, and 6-10?</p>
