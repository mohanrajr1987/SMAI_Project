<p>So the situation is I have my style set up in the head like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;style&gt;     .img_png_1 {         background-repeat: no-repeat;         background-position: -20px -80px;         width: 200px;         height: 400px;     } &lt;/style&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have then downloaded an image as base64 code, and thrown it into a div:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="backgroundImage"&gt;     base 64 code will be here &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This code was loaded by an ajax call. So once it is down, I want to then make this image the background for the style. The catch is that the div that will contain the background image is not yet created. If it was, I could do something like:</p>  <pre><code>$(".img_png_1").css("background-image", "url('data:image/png;base64," + $("#backgroundImage").text() + "')"); </code></pre>  <p>to get the background image into the div (I have not tested this yet as it is not what I want anyhow), but this would only work for already loaded divs.</p>  <p>I want to load this code into the style for all future use when a div with that class is created. I tried a few things with append, but then I can only write an entire style, not append to a particular style.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
