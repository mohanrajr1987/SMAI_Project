<p>I mean it for putting it in <code>VARCHAR</code> column having <code>utf8_bin</code> collation. The thing with base64 is that the resulting text is longer than original and second issue is if I correctly understand  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1997540/mysql-varchar-lengths-and-utf-8">this question</a> the mysql limits varchar on number of chars not on their real byte size and since utf-8 encoded text can have chars that spans 3 bytes that could limit possibility of hitting the column boundary.</p>  <p>The resulting utf-8 text should like like gibberish chinese or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake" rel="nofollow">mojibake</a> as in here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/891643/twitter-image-encoding-challenge">Twitter image encoding challenge</a></p>  <p>But my question is precisely about if there is a maybe some kind of 'standardish' algorithm so I would not have to reinvent the wheel.</p>
