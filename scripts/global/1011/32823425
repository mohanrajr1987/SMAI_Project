<p>I am trying to read the Ydata from an XML file. The Base64 string containing the Ydata is a 1245-elements numerical vector and is stored in data$ATR. The file has been encoded according to the gaml.org standards.</p>  <p>Tried too many things the whole day, but none is working... Will not post here all the countless things I tried and that does not work. I am out of ideas. How to convert it to R numeric vector?</p>  <pre><code>library(XML) x = XML::xmlTreeParse("http://utsav.podzone.net/T0011VAP1.0.xml") xmltop = xmlRoot(x) data = xmlSApply(xmltop, function(x) xmlSApply(x, xmlValue)) (data$ATR) </code></pre>  <p>From an independent source, I know that the first 10 elemens of Ydata are :</p>  <pre><code>-0.0903 -0.0751 -0.0605 -0.0471 -0.0353 -0.0249 -0.0159 -0.0082 -0.0017  0.0035 </code></pre>
