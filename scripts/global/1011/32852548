<p>I want to post a tweet to twitter with images attached to it. I have gone through following apis:</p>  <p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/update" rel="nofollow">https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/update</a>  <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/media/upload" rel="nofollow">https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/media/upload</a></p>  <p>The second api mentions two ways to upload an image to twitter but my problem is I have an image link hosted on my server for that image. How can I use that url to upload to twitter ? Is there any other api which can support this, uploading using a image url ? If not, is there any other way I can achieve this ? should I download the image first and then convert it to base64 encoding ?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
