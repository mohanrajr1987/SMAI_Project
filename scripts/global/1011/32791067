<p>Been working in Java with images from the web encoded as base64 strings. I have only seen image/png format in img src tags i.e. <code>data:image/png;base64,{eNc0d3d_St!ng...}</code> I have not seen image/gif or image/jpg. I have looked on SO and read a little on base 64 encoding.</p>  <p>Furthermore, I strip off the <code>data:image/png;base64</code> part in Java (Android) when doing  <code>Base64.decode(src, Base64.DEFAULT)</code> so it looks like there is no need for the png in that situation. In fact if I do not strip off this "header" then  <code>BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray</code> returns null.</p>  <p>So the question is, are there other formats other than png for image encoding on the web?</p>
