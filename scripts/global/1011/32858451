<p>I have created a chrome app , i want to store the encrypted base64 URL of a video file using chrome.Storage.local API so that no one can use that URL to play that video in Offline mode only authenticated user can play .</p>  <p>I have search about chrome.Storage API, there i find the statement "Confidential user information should not be stored! The storage area isn't encrypted." Thats why i want to encrypt that base64 url.</p>  <p>Thanx.</p>
