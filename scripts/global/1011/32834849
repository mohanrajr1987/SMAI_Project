<p>I am looking for a perl script able to decode multiple lines of Base64 encoded strings. I found a few tools to do the job line by line. Which is really time consuming considering the amount of lines that I have. I can have all the strings in one base file called "infile.txt", would that be possible to run a perl script to convert all the lines in "infile.txt" to "outfile.txt" and keeping one line per string? </p>  <p>Thanks for guiding me.</p>
