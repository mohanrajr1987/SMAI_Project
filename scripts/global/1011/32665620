<p>I am parsing attachments using MimeMessageParser/DataSource classes from javax.mail.  The incoming MIME has base64 encoded attachment files, and I need the base64 encoded output as is, but DataSource.getInputStream() returns decoded output.  As I have to store the base64 in my application, I don't want re-encode it again to base64, if possible.  Please let me know if there is a way.</p>  <pre><code>MimeMessageParser mmparser; mmparser=.... .. for (int i = 0; i &lt; attachmentList.size(); i++) { DataSource dataSource = attachmentList.get(i); //dataSource.getInputStream(); this returns decoded stream // need the base64 encoded stream fromm the original email attachment } </code></pre>
