<p>A PDF file is being generated client-side using <code>jsPDF</code>, encoded in base64 using <code>btoa()</code>, sent to a PHP API and there it's decoded and saved as a binary file, but it isn't working and I'm getting a malformed PDF.</p>  <p>PHP code:</p>  <pre><code>$destination = 'test/file.pdf'; $content = base64_decode($content); $uploaded = file_put_contents($destination, $content); </code></pre>  <p>If I compare both files (The pdf file downloaded directly from the frontend, which works, vs the one downloaded from the server) this is what I get:</p>  <p>Original PDF File fragment (I cannot disclose the full file): <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d7Z4K.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d7Z4K.png" alt="original one, working well"></a></p>  <p>Post encode/decode one: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WLuZB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WLuZB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What could be causing this difference? Seems to be an encoding problem?</p>
