<p>I'm running Spark applications on YARN, when I kill the job using:</p>  <pre><code>yarn application kill -applicationId application_XYZ </code></pre>  <p>I can not go to Spark Job GUI of killed application form Hadoop GUI (ResourceManager). When I open Spark history server directly and try to display Incomplete application application logs it works. When job is completed (not killed) log can be displayed this way: Hadoop GUI -> Spark history server. I'm using YARN log aggregation service to aggregate logs. Aslo I can access application logs using:</p>  <pre><code>yarn logs -applicationId application_XYZ </code></pre>  <p>Have you expirianced same behaviour when you kill Spark appliction? Is there anything wrong with killing application this way?</p>
