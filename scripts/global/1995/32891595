<p>I'm running a Hadoop cluster with 6 nodes, but in the Hadoop Map/Reduce Administration page, I see 30 nodes listed.  When I select that number and see the Hadoop Machine List page, I see that all but 6 of those nodes have a "Seconds since heartbeat" greater than 0, which means that 24 nodes are outdated.</p>  <p>Thus, it seems that "dead" nodes (with heartbeats>0) are showing up with the "live" nodes</p>  <p>I'm running mesos on hadoop, and I wonder if that is the reason for the "dead" nodes appearing.  Any suggestions for how to correct this error?</p>
