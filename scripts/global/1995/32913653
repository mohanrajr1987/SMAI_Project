<p>I am running a mapreduce job using Table MapReduce Util which takes the hbase table data(1 million rows) as input,In mapper I am evaluating a particular set of expressions for every row input from hbase table and it was getting completed less time as long as expressions to be evaluated for a particular row were around 10 to 20.</p>  <p>But as the number of expressions have increased to 100(to be calculated for every row in hbase table) my mapreduce job is taking so much time so i thought of using the same job(same mapreduce jar) in parallel for 10 times with 10 expressions each so that if all the jobs run in parallel i can achieve the output faster. I tried to launch 10 jobs in parallel using a shell script but initially 2 jobs are getting completed in parallel and then only it's launching other two jobs and so on...As far as my understanding this jar file is able to launch only 2 parallel jobs at a time and it's only allowing the other jobs to access it only when the current running jobs gets completed. </p>  <p>so is there any other way to launch all the jobs in parallel using the same map reduce jar file...?</p>
