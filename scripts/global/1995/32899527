<p>Our research group has Hadoop and HBase set up and running.</p>  <p>Recently I am using Hadoop streaming (only mappers) to process data, and I wish to use HBase as the data sink. I feel that I can set -outputformat to TableOutFormat. But after searching web for some time, I found out that specific operations can take much time to figure out.</p>  <p>Below is my trial:</p>  <pre><code>$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \     -input myInputDirs \     -outputformat HBaseLibDir/TableOutFormat \     -mapper myMapperScript \     -numReduceTasks 0 </code></pre>  <p>Can someone with experience teach me how to do this? including what to change in myMapperScript, and the parameters that passed in to initialize the streaming job.</p>
