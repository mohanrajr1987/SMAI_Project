<p>I am working on a security project that needs to restrict the access of mappers and reducers. <br>Say in wordcount example, I have 5 files. I group 3 of the files as group 1 and 2 remaining files as group 2. All the group1 files should go to the same node in the cluster and all the group 2 files should go the same node. How can I do this? <br> <br> I started looking at source code but couldn't understand where to start. Any suggestions on how to do this or where to get started would be greatly helpful. </p>
