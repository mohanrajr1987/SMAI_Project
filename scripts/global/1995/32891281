<p>I have a hive table, which also has in some tuples entries as hexa decimal which are saved as String in the table. Now I would like to find these entries, I tried: </p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM table_1 WHERE column_1 like '0x%';  </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM table_1 WHERE column_1 like '%' + CHAR(0x00) +'%'; </code></pre>  <p>For the second query I get a message, that Hive cannot recognize the part of the query with CHAR(0x00). Do you have any idea how I can find these guys?</p>  <p>Examples of possible entries in this column are: 0000006A, 0000064C, 002.039.004</p>  <p>Best regards</p>
