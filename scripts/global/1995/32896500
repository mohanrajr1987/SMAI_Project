<p>I have a table in a database in hive.  The table is partitioned based on year month and day.</p>  <p>My query looks something like this </p>  <pre><code>select entity1,entity2 from table_t   INNER JOIN tab_roll.cha alias2   ON alias1.sid = alias2.sid    INNER JOIN net_roll.net alias3   ON alias2.id=alias3.id    where event= 'unknown'    and day &gt;= 10 and day &lt; 12   and month &gt;= 5 and month &lt; 11   and year = 2014 </code></pre>  <p>now I want to get results between say mm-dd-yyy HH : MM :SS and mm-dd-yyy HH : MM :SS, how should I do that? </p>  <p>Is is possible to have a pop up where the user chooses the date/time ranges?</p>  <p>Don't know if this helps but the data has about 500 million rows. Thanks</p>
