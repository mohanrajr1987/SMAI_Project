<p>I am working on hadoop. I was looking for hadoop installation on Windows though everywhere it is mentioned to be installed on linux/unix system. While configuring hadoop on windows, the problem I am facing is Java home path. As there is only jre installed on my machine, I mentioned the same path in environment variable and in hadoop-env.cmd file. When I am trying to use any hadoop command it is giving me error saying Java home not correctly specified. Here is my Java home path "C:/Program Files/Java/jre7/bin" There is not jdk installed in there.</p>  <p>Please help me installing hadoop with the same configuration I have.</p>  <p>Note: As the machines are provided by my organisation, I don't have rights to installed java related software. By default we have that jre installed in our machines by our administrator.</p>
