<p>I'm working in Hive on data set below </p>  <pre><code>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ code             dateJ                 capa +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 1988           2015-08-22               23 0470           2015-07-26               455 ...             .....                   ... 5884           2015-08-01               54 4587           2015-06-05              100 </code></pre>  <p>I would like to pick up "code" from the table between two dates. query below works :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT code FROM tabl WHERE dateJ BETWEEN '2015-06-05' AND '2015-08-22' </code></pre>  <p>But when I use nested/sub-queries I doesn't work :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT code FROM tabl WHERE dateJ BETWEEN (SELECT MIN(dateJ) FROM tabl) and (SELECT MAX(dateJ) FROM tabl) </code></pre>  <p>Does any body could help on how I can fix the problem (with the second query). hive don't support subqueries.</p>  <p>Thx</p>
