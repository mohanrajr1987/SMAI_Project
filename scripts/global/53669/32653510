<p>is there a way to detect if calling <code>play()</code> on a video element is allowed without a user gesture? On Android Chrome this warning is given:</p>  <p><code>Failed to execute 'play' on 'HTMLMediaElement': API can only be initiated by a user gesture.</code></p>  <p>So on Chrome Android a user gesture is required to start the playback of a video, while it isn't on desktop Chrome.  Is there a way to  detect which behavior I will get?</p>  <p>I want to have slightly different behavior in my app depending on if calling play programatically is allowed or not.</p>  <p>I have tried to use <code>Modernizr.videoautoplay</code>, but that checks if the <code>autoplay</code> property on the element, which is not the same thing. This gives false negatives for IE11 and Edge.</p>  <p>Edit: added <a href="http://ea7e83c432c066554d3ef3e6580aa1af9bd594a1.googledrive.com/host/0BwqnHXhKkJ7mfjF5clFzSUFSY3pjSzhxZlA0TnpIeEo2bHlaY2FZd3RhWDFHY1o2eXZsYXc/android_play_fail.html" rel="nofollow">an example</a>. The video will start playing automatically in Chrome desktop and IE11 or Edge (with 3s delay) on windows 8 or 10. For Chrome@Android a user interaction is needed (clicking the button) and the error message can be seen in the console.</p>
