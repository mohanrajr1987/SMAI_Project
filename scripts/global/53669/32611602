<p>I have got really weird problem that occurs only on Mozilla Firefox 40.0.3 (works on Chrome). My system is Ubuntu 15.04.</p>  <p>Youtube video inserted as <strong>iframe</strong> is duplicated, while on Youtube site it is displayed correctly. We have got multiple videos on this page - all inserted the same way - and only few of them are broken.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_WVs6AgboiY" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; </code></pre>  <p>See: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vujcR.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/vujcR.png</a></p>  <p>I will try re-uploading videos on Youtube. Anybody have idea what are the reason for this behaviour?</p>
