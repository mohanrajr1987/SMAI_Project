<p>I am looking to display a video length in the following of two formats:</p>  <p>if less than 59 seconds:</p>  <p>{no_of_sec}</p>  <p>if above 59 seconds:</p>  <p>{no_of_sec} : {no_of_sec}</p>  <p>At the moment this code:</p>  <pre><code>document.getElementById("video2").duration </code></pre>  <p>Returns the following value:</p>  <pre><code>18.133313 </code></pre>  <p>I only need need it roundest to the nearest second then in the format above. Without overthinking it, I presume I need to round it. This can be done using Math.round() but it is when the number goes above 59 seconds is where I am struggle.</p>  <p>I plan to put this into an function which would loop through video elements with a class called:</p>  <pre><code>.has--videoDuration </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
