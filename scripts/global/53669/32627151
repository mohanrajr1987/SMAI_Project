<p>I have the following piece of code in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>  <pre><code>var canplay = false; if (window.addEventListener) {     window.addEventListener('canplay', function(ev) {         canplay = true;     }, true); } </code></pre>  <p>And later I have a <code>addEventListener</code> attached to video, but it's not firing because <code>canplay</code> is already being fired (and handled from the code above).</p>  <p>That's okay, but why we attach that event listener to <code>window</code> object and why it works?</p>
