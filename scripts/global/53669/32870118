<p>i was messing around making a simple HTML5 page with some UI features &amp; a video control. I deployed the page on Samsung galaxy tab having lollipop and the video works as expected, running in full screen.</p>  <p>However, if i deploy it on same Samsung galaxy tab with KitKat version, this video is running in center of the screen.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me figure out what could be the problem? both devices are same with just different OS</p>
