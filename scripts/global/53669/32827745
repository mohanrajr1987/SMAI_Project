<p>Having strange issues with chrome. I have a site that uses video.js, and displays multiple product videos. On IE and Firefox, all videos load fine - no problem. Chrome only seems to allow 6 to play. Now, im not trying to play 6 at one time, but i would like the thumbnails to at least populate. Content, interestingly, does not load either when you click play on videos that are not a part of the initial 6 that were loaded. In video.js, i have autoplay and other related tags that would kick off a video to play / queue disabled. Any way I can get around this limitation?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!
