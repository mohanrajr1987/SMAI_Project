<p>I have a <code>video</code> element on a page that has a round play button on its center. This play button is part of <code>video</code>'s shadow DOM and has style <code>transform: translate3d(0,0,0)</code>. Now the problem is, if I overlay a <code>div</code> on top of this <code>video</code> (say using position absolute), A round shape appears on the top of this overlay. With the help of web inspector I found out that it's because of the <code>translate3d</code> applied to it by the user style sheet making it appear on another layer.</p>  <p>I wanted to counter this effect of <code>translate3d</code>. For same I added this in my page.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;style&gt;   video::-webkit-media-controls-start-playback-button {     -webkit-transform: none;     transform: none;   } &lt;/style&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Inspite of this, the <code>translate3d</code> seems to take precedence. I replaced <code>none</code> with <code>scale(1.5,1.5)</code>, the circle appeared bigger and also <code>translate3d</code> was taking effect. Is there a way I can counter the useragent styles in shadow DOM?</p>  <p>I found this to be happening only in iOS 9 Mobile Safari.</p>
