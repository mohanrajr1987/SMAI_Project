<p>I've created an offline web app which shows in remote chrome debugging console as correctly caching all the files and it shows that it is correctly offline capable. The video, listed in the manifest shows as downloaded into the cache but when i turn on airplane mode and try to play, it shows an empty video.</p>  <p>How do I get a video to play offline?</p>  <p>Cache Manifest</p>  <pre><code>CACHE MANIFEST  CACHE: main.js video.mp4 </code></pre>  <p>HTML link to manifest</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html manifest="cache.manifest"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to do this?</p>
