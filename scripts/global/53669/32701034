<p>I have a website where several HTML5 videos should the background (one on each page). Because the videos are in the background (full size) they should be high definition. 1080p or 720p.</p>  <p>I have tried to convert with the the Xilisoft Video Converter but even if I change the quality settings (on the mp4/ogg HTML5 video profile) - I get a result which does not really look good.</p>  <p>What are the best encoding settings and the best video converter for HTML5 video?</p>  <p>What size is the best for my purpose? Any other advice for HD HTML5 videos?</p>
