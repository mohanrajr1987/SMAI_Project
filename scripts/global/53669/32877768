<p>In attempting to create an interactive quiz inside a video in Edge Animate, there have been a number of issues. Not sure if it's beginner problem or buggy software. Can anyone advise?</p>  <p>First issue is loss of video controls during playback.</p>  <p>Second, can't figure out how to create an action to start the quiz after pausing video.</p>  <p>There are a number of other things, if anyone's willing and able to help, they can be listed more specifically.</p>
