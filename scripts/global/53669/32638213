<p>I hope someone can help me. I am looking to change the video which currently plays on the hero panel on the homepage to show an image instead. Of course I can hide the video by using CSS but this would still mean the video would be loading in the background which is not what I want.</p>  <p>This is the html I have.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;video id="heroVideo" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" poster="../images/video-bg.jpg"&gt;     &lt;source src="../video/loop.webm" type="video/webm"&gt;     &lt;source src="../video/loop.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt; &lt;/video&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have done the following which seems to work but wondered if there is a better way:</p>  <pre><code>if (Modernizr.mq('only all and (max-width: 768px)')) {     $('#heroVideo').detach(); } </code></pre>  <p>Is this the right way of doing it or is there a better way. </p>
