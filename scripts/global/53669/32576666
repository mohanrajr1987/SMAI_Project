<p>I'm using slimerjs to do some headless firefox work on ubuntu 14.04. Everything appears to work correctly according to the logs but the output from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder" rel="nofollow">MediaRecorder</a> API is a completely blank video. It is outputting a video of the correct length but it's completely black. </p>  <p>The same code run on my desktop (non-headless mode) outputs the video properly.</p>  <p>This is using firefox version 40.0.3.</p>
