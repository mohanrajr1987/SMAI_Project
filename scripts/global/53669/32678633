<p>I am using Google Developers Video Suite Inspector (<a href="https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/vastinspector" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/vastinspector</a>) to test my video ads.</p>  <p>I have an interactivce video ad which is hosted on YouTube. According to the IMA SDK specs, the ad is supposed to use the "videoSlot" parameter to get the hosting video player and place its video in the "src" property of that player. It can then call play on that player to play the video ad.</p>  <p>What I'm finding is that if I place a vimeo video, for example, in the src property, the video plays with no problem. However, if I place a YouTube url as the src, I get an error event with no additional information.</p>  <p>Please note that if I use the Flash player on this page, everything works fine. The only problem is with the Html5 player.</p>
