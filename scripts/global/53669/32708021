<p>I'm trying to make an interactive video that works for both mobile and desktop where the video is presented in sections, and the user can drag and drop the pieces around the screen to create a collage. <a href="http://files.dancarr.co/blog/video_tiles/video_tile_examples/example_videotilesdrag.html" rel="nofollow">Here's an example that works on desktop only.</a> (not my code)</p>  <p>jQuery UI and <a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/content.php?/draggable/default-functionality" rel="nofollow">jQuery Touch Punch</a> let me drag and drop elements in mobile browsers browser. It works great.</p>  <p>I have it working swimmingly on desktop adapting <a href="http://blog.dancarr.co/html5-canvas-rendering-web-video-to-tiles/" rel="nofollow">Dan Carr's code</a>. His demo doesn't run on mobile, but that's only because it doesn't have the requisite play button. With some work, I had it loading the video on mobile, but it crashed Safari on my iPad Mini 1 in seconds. And after trying it on a couple other mobile devices (although nothing state of the art), it seems the constant refreshing of the canvas tiles is just too much for mobile devices to handle. Even dropping the refresh rate to 10 frames per second crashed all mobile devices I tested with pretty quickly.</p>  <p>My next thought was to just load a bunch of lower res html5 videos as individual videos and play them simultaneously, but I quickly realized iOS isn't doesn't allow more than one HTML5 video to be playing at once :-(. </p>  <p>My next thought is to have one video and then accompanying gifs. For this project, only one of the tiles has to be perfectly synced to the audio. Everything else just has to be close, so that could work. It just stinks that it will require me to either make major sacrifices in terms of quality of the picture or size of the media content, so I'm hoping there's some other way...</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
