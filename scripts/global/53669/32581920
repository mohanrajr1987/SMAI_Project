<p>I'm implementing a video player that can be used in all browsers. Getting the idea from <a href="http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody" rel="nofollow">Video For Everybody</a>, I have a video html 5 tag and a flash fallback. Issues are:</p>  <p>1- On IE 8, the video does not load until the play button is clicked! How can I make it so that it starts loading the video automatically?</p>  <p>2- I need to run a js function when the play button is clicked. I've used "onplay" event of Html 5 video tag but I cannot find anything for flash player.</p>  <p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
