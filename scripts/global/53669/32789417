<p>Where I can read information and see examples of loading chunks into html5 video?<br><br> Scenario:<br> 1. User starts play a large video.<br> 2. 10-20 seconds of the video should be downloaded.<br> 3. If user watches first 10 seconds then next 10 seconds should be downloaded. Thus, there will be no load if the user looks only the first 9 seconds of video.<br><br> If we use this scenario it will reduce server load (in some cases).<br><br> For example:<br> Try to watch video on YouTube. They work like this. Try to load half video (~3 mins) and start watch it from beginning. Other part of video will not be downloaded until you reach special point (~ 50 seconds before the downloads point, in my case).<br><br> I can't find any controls of buffering in html5 video. Also I can't find any controls of buffering in popular html5 based video players like VideoJs, JPlayer.<br><br> Does somebody know how to do it?</p>
