<p>According to <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference#playlist" rel="nofollow">http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference#playlist</a> JWPlayer can be fed with a playlist of items and supports a unified timeline. I've roughly researched a couple of alternatives such as mediaelementjs and videojs, both have "playlist" capability but not quite as JWPlayer's. Their playlist feature appears to work to support item switches without a unified timeline. What player out there does what JWPlayer does in this case?</p>
