<p>The following shows the video controls fine in Firefox, but does not behave as intended in the current version of internet explorer.  Specifically, it only shows the video controls for a second on page load, and then the video controls disappear until the user hovers the mouse over the poster image.  <strong>How can I change the code below so that the video controls remain visible in internet explorer?</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;video width="416" height="234" preload controls poster="/path/to/video_frame.jpg"&gt;     &lt;source src="/path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"/&gt;     Your browser does not support the html5 video tag. &lt;/video&gt;   </code></pre>  <p>With windows update, the version of internet explorer is always the most recent.</p>
