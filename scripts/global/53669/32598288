<p>I'm embedding a video on a page using the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag. Simple enough... it plays fine and loops as desired, but I've noticed that on an older Macbook after allowing the computer to sleep and then wake up, the video becomes glitchy and stops playing.</p>  <p>Specifically I've noticed this happen intermittently on a 2011 Macbook in Webkit browsers, but never on a 2014 Macbook. Haven't been able to test other machines. From what I can find online this seems to be a graphics card issue? If that is the case, is there a way I can possibly pause the video before the machine goes to sleep?</p>  <p>It's a pretty straightforward video implementation:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;video class="embedded-video" loop="loop" muted="muted" preload="auto"&gt;   &lt;source src="videos/promo.mp4" type="video/mp4" /&gt; &lt;/video&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Anyone know if it's possible to resolve this?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wmxgN.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wmxgN.jpg" alt="glitchy video"></a></p>
