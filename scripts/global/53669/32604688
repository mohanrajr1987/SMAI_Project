<p>I was very hesitant to post this, but I’ve searched and searched and found nothing that works, it’s driving me mad. I tried things I found on this site that I thought might apply such as surrounding the video divs in another container. I also tried creating another video div thinking it would stick if there was one to the right of it, but this just made the div jump down while the three other divs stayed where they should.</p>  <p>I don’t entirely understand the code on my responsive site, I just borrowed a lot of ideas and code and then customized it and did a lot of research on specific topics, then tried different code until it worked. So I’m quite sure there is a lot of unnecessary code in there which is possibly creating this issue.</p>  <p>I’ve tried adding the following code to the video div as well as various combinations of the code.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>display: inline-block; <br>   vertical-align: top;<br>   overflow: hidden;<br>   clear: both; <br>   position: relative;<br>   float: right: (this made the div jump left)</p> </blockquote>  <p>To you guys it’s probably ridiculous I would even think those code changes would do anything to help, but that’s essentially all I could find on related Stack Overflow questions. I found a solution to every other issue by searching this site, so I really appreciate Stack Overflow.</p>  <p>Tried the W3 Validator for any clues, but it didn’t offer any help, the only thing is it didn’t like my using percentages for image width which is necessary for responsive sites. Could that possibly be an issue? I feel like this must happen to other people, responsive CSS div positioning has to be confusing to more people than just me.</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/kepwL9vg/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/kepwL9vg/</a></p>  <p>Here's the CSS where I'm guessing the issues are contained:</p>  <pre><code>/*************************************************** STRUCTURE ***************************************************/ #pagewrap {     width: 100%;     height: 100%;     margin: 0 auto;     text-align: left;     overflow: hidden; /*fixed expanding box on cv*/ }  /****************************************************** CLEARFIX ******************************************************/ .clearfix:after { visibility: hidden; display: block; font-size: 0; content: " "; clear: both; height: 0; } .clearfix { display: inline-block; } .clearfix { display: block; zoom: 1; }  /**************************************************** GALLERY ****************************************************/ .container {     width: 100%;     margin: 0 auto;     border-top: solid #FFF .8em; /*old=2*/     overflow: hidden;     max-width: 1880px;     text-align: center;     display: block; }  /****************************************************** VIDEO ******************************************************/ .video {     color: #000;     font: 10px/1.5 Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;     width: 48%;     margin: auto 1% 50px 1%;     float: left;     display: inline;     border-top: solid #FFF 1.6em; /*added after header height change */ }  .video h3 {     text-align: center;     text-transform: uppercase; } </code></pre>
