<p>My web service fetches chunks of .ts files from an m3u8 file and create a single .ts file.Now I want to play this file on web.For that I use 'avconv' utility in Ubuntu via</p>  <blockquote>   <p>avconv -i source.ts -acodec copy -vcodec copy destination.mp4</p> </blockquote>  <p>However I dont get a good 'playable' mp4 everytime.Sometimes its just audio and video stucks in between. It also shows wrong duration label.</p>  <p>Is there any good way to convert .ts into mp4 or BETTER into webm format.My requirement is to play on web ...</p>  <p>Thanks in advance </p>
