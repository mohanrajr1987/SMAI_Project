<p>Google provides a reference application for EME with PlayReady. See EME with PlayReady: <a href="http://goo.gl/0vdok" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/0vdok</a></p>  <p>Which browser/operating system combination supports this reference setup? According to the documentation from Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 should support EME/PR on Win 8.1 or Win 10, but in my tests the Internet Explorer does not recognize the video format. </p>
