<p>I'm using IIS to serve mp4 videos. I get a 404 on mac/safari. It works in chrome and firefox on the same macs. The MIME is video/mp4 . </p>  <p>I've ran tests locally to rule out the video encoding, and the videojs. I've taken the request path directly as well, skipping the html and js, with the same results. Safari will not load the direct  url to the video either.</p>  <p>I'm not sure where to look next? </p>
