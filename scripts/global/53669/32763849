<p>I'm building a leader video and the embedded .mp4 video is completely messed up on only Firefox. All other browsers are fine. Here is a link directly to the video so you can <a href="http://qracorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/solutionsHero.mp4" rel="nofollow">see what I mean</a>.</p>  <p>Bizarre eh? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>Edit: Ok, so I found out this is an issue only affecting older Firefox browsers. I cannot create it on a new browser. I'm going to investigate this further and I'll report back if I find anything.</p>
