<p>Let's say we have a directory full of files (let's call it file structure A, FSA) with blocks of code like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="Look out its a div" id="look-out"&gt;     &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#{Include_Path}/" lang="en"&gt;#{Variable_Home}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#{Include_Book}/account.php"&gt;#{Variable_Account}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li lang="en"&gt;#{Variable_BookName}&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>All of those <code>#{}</code> helpers are including some other template data and plugging it into this template, and this template itself might be included somewhere else. That compilation process occurs on a closed server, so we don't have access to exactly how it all works.</p>  <p>However, the compiled files are then used to serve a normal website, which can be crawled completely using <code>wget</code>.</p>  <p>So, using <code>wget</code> we have a file structure (file structure B, FSB) that is completely dissimilar from FSA but must necessarily be derived from it.</p>  <p>Let's say that the above code block theoretically compiled to something like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="Look out its a div" id="look-out"&gt;     &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/include/path/" lang="en"&gt;Welcome Home!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/various/account.php"&gt;Hello Mr. Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li lang="en"&gt;Book Book Book&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but that compiled version is also "hidden" among a huge mish-mash of other similar things, in the completely dissimilar FSB.</p>  <p><strong>How would we glean what the various <code>#{}</code> helpers actually compile to, so that we could compile the original files but keep them neatly decomposed in FSA?</strong></p>  <p>What algorithm would even be used to do such a thing?</p>
