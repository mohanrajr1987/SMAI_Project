<p>I have the below:</p>  <pre><code>            var trayHistories = await table                 .Where(history =&gt; history.TrayId.Equals(trayId))                 .Select(history =&gt; history.Status).ToListAsync(); </code></pre>  <p>Using Azure Mobile Services, how can I get the above to work.</p>  <p>It says: "history.TrayId.Equals("") is not supported in a 'Where' Mobile Services query expression.</p>  <p>If I replace this by using Status (It's an int), it works.  It seems to <strong>only</strong> be Strings.</p>  <p>The TrayHistory (Object in the table) is a simple:</p>  <p>Id, TrayId (String), Status (Int), Name (String).</p>  <p>I'll be looking into using a REST call, but I would much rather do this.</p>  <p>Thanks!
