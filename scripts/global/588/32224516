<p>I think that I don't understand the difference between these two functions I was trying to find any relation between them by runing following code (PHP 5.6)</p>  <pre><code>$crc_codding = crc32("codding"); $crc_gnu = crc32("gnu");  $hash_codding = hash("crc32", "codding"); $hash_gnu = hash("crc32", "gnu"); // hash collision with $crc_codding example  var_dump(hash_equals($hash_codding, $hash_gnu));  // bool(false)  var_dump($crc_codding==$hash_codding);            // bool(false) var_dump($crc_codding==$crc_gnu);                 // bool(true) var_dump($crc_codding===$crc_gnu);                // bool(true) </code></pre>  <p>But this did not help me, does hash() funtion have some built-in salting mechanism?</p>  <p>I am not sure if I can tell something more...</p>
