<p>There are a lot of binary diff tools out there:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta" rel="nofollow">xdelta</a></li> <li>rdiff</li> <li><a href="http://www.cjmweb.net/vbindiff/" rel="nofollow">vbdiff</a></li> <li><a href="https://rsync.samba.org/" rel="nofollow">rsync</a></li> </ul>  <p>and so on. They are great, but one-threaded. Is it possible to split large files on chunks, find diff between chunks simultaneously and then merge into the final delta? Any other tools, libraries to find delta between very large files (hundreds Gb) in a reasonable amount of time and RAM? May be I could implement algorithm myself, but can not find any papers about it.</p>
