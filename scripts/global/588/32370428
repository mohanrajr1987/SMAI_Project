<p>I kind of know it is possible to do what I want, because I saw it (trough softwares of mass spectrometry for example).</p>  <p>Let's imagine I have a "bar code":</p>  <pre><code>1,00 | 1,42 | 2,17 | 2,13 </code></pre>  <p>This bar code is a reference, let's say an object A is identified with this pattern.</p>  <p>If I now come up with another bar code, this time from an unidentified object:</p>  <pre><code>1,00 | 1,40 | 2,2 | 2,10 </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to give a "score match" for the unidentified compound ? Like, "unidentified object matches pattern A with a 95 % probability" ?</p>  <p>I know the question seems vague for now, but I need a starting point.</p>
