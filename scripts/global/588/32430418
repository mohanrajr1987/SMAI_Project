<p>I have to check if a string inside a variable has <strong>all</strong> the strings inside an <strong>array</strong> on it. Very simple I thing, but I cant get it to work! I have tried a lot of things but are to complex and not really working. I'm looking to some suggestion.</p>  <p>Something like:</p>  <pre><code>var myArray = ["cat","dog","bird"]; var myString = "There is a cat looking the bird and a dog looking the cat"; var myString2 = "There is a cat and a dog looking one each other"; </code></pre>  <p>myArray and <strong>myString</strong> must be true and <strong>true</strong> and myArray and <strong>myString2</strong> must result <strong>false</strong></p>  <p>I was working with something like this:</p>  <pre><code>var selector = "dir.class#id"; var code = '&lt;div id="id" class="class"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'; var tokens = selector.split(/[\.,#]+/);  for (var i = tokens.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {     var counter = [];     if (code.indexOf(tokens[0]) &gt; -1 ) {         counter.concat(true);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
