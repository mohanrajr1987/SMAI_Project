<p>I have a table with ten fields that can all have values within a defined set. I want to select records from this table only where the ten columns do not repeat the same value more than x number of times.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4  col5  col6  col7  col8  col9 --------------------------------------------------------  1  a     b     c     d     e     f     g     h     i  2  a     a     a     b     c     d     e     f     g  3  a     a     a     a     b     c     d     e     f  4  b     c     d     e     f     g     h     i     j  5  c     c     c     c     d     c     c     f     g </code></pre>  <p>Given the example table above, I want my SELECT to return records 1, 2 and 4. Rows 3 and 5 each have four or more columns with the same value.</p>  <p>The only idea I've come up with thus far is to concatenate all ten columns and then have iterative instr calls, but this would be very static and not performance-friendly.</p>  <p>Thanks for your attention.</p>
