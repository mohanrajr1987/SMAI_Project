<p>I have the following</p>  <p><code>var list = new List&lt;Schedule&gt;();</code></p>  <p><code>Schedule</code> object has the following properties:</p>  <ul> <li>StartTime (DateTime)</li> <li>EndTime (DateTime)</li> </ul>  <p>Is there a one-line piece of code that can check if the time constraints overlap in <code>list</code> while iterating through all its <code>Schedule</code> members?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I'm trying to have the logic of the above in a method called <code>EnforceOverlapPolicy()</code> that technically would throw a new exception if there are any conflicts.</p> </blockquote>
