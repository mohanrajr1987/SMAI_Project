<p>I have an array that looks something like the following </p>  <pre><code>[1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6] </code></pre>  <p>I want to find the bottom and top of the array and simply output it as 6+ at the top, and 1- at the bottom, so I'd want to cut the array down to <code>[1,2,2,2,3,4,5,6]</code> and then return the first and last values (without disturbing any plateaus in the middle).</p>  <p>I can't figure out how to identify where in the array the ends occur. Any ideas?</p>
