<p>I am trying to validate what I thought would be fairly simple to do.  I have two time_select attributes "start_time" and "end_time".  I am simply trying to validate in the controller whether the end time entered by the user is equal to the start time or before the start time.  There are no dates involved at all.  I have a validation method below however it always errors no matter what is entered by the user.  </p>  <p>Fairly new to rails and can't help but feel im missing something small.  This validation should work shouldn't it?</p>  <pre><code>class Casenote &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  validate :end_must_be_after_start   belongs_to :servicelog  default_scope { order(:id) }    private   def end_must_be_after_start    if :start_time &gt;= :end_time      errors.add(:end_time, "must be after start time")    end  end  end </code></pre>
