<p>I have two objects of the same class:</p>  <pre><code>Car oldCar = new Car() {    Engine = "V6",    Wheels = 4 } Car newCar = new Car() {    Engine = "V8"    Wheels = 4 } </code></pre>  <p>I want to compare the properties of the two <code>Car</code> objects, and if different (like in the example), print the old and updated values, like this:</p>  <pre><code>Engine: V6 -&gt; V8 </code></pre>  <p>The way I'm doing this at the moment is going to be really inconvenient as I add more properties to the Car class:</p>  <pre><code>if(oldCar.Engine != newCar.Engine)    Console.WriteLine(oldCar.Engine + " -&gt; " + newCar.Engine); </code></pre>  <p>How can I accomplish this in a simpler way? I don't want to manually compare every single property.</p>
