<p>I'm trying to delete files from a folder where the date modified is greater than 3 days. </p>  <pre><code>    numdays = 86400 * 3  # Seconds in a day times 3 days from datetime import datetime a = datetime.now() for delete_f in os.listdir(src1):     file_path = os.path.join(src1, delete_f)     try:         if (a - datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file_path)) &gt;   numdays):        os.unlink(file_path) except Exception as e:     print (e) </code></pre>  <p>I get the error unorderable types: datetime.timedelta() > int()</p>  <p>I'm not really sure how to go about getting the numdays part, anyone have suggestions? TIA</p>
