<p>Hi I have a business idea for a price comparison website. I have limited knowledge in web design and development so I thought I would ask the experts before doing anything else! I have heard about API's and all this but I have also read that it is possible with WordPress so I'm not sure what way to go. All help appreciated and thanks!</p>
