<p>I have a simple question. I need to compare different trajectories made by different cars. So, I have different .csv files of different length containing different routes made by the different cars over the time. </p>  <pre><code>import pandas as pd df = pd.read.csv("car1_route0.csv")  df1 = pd.read.csv("car1_route1.csv") df = lat            lon 48.787834   11.383918 48.788124   11.384003 48.787849   11.383751  df1 = 48.787834   11.383918 48.788124   11.384003 48.787849   11.383751 48.787849   12.000000 </code></pre>  <p>At the end I would like to have a data frame that contains all the points counting the number of time people goes trough that point.</p>  <pre><code>out = lat         lon         time 48.787834   11.383918    2 48.788124   11.384003    2 48.787849   11.383751    2 48.787849   12.000000    1 </code></pre>
