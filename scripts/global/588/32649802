<p><strong>Summary</strong> (For tho who want the tl;dr version, you may skip to the question below):</p>  <p>I've just gone through this problem: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7015709/xcode-getting-warning-implicit-conversion-from-enumeration-type-uideviceorient">Comparing UIDeviceOrienation and UIInterfaceOrientation</a>. After that, I took a look at how bitwise work (because I've seen them sometimes, but not really understand how they work.)</p>  <p>So, I've taken a research about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3427585/understanding-the-bitwise-and-operator">What's bitwise operator</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176149/multiple-value-enum-in-obj-c">How enum in objective-c work with bit</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3524362/how-to-use-enums-with-bit-flags">How to use enum that's in bit</a>.</p>  <p><strong>(TL;DR)</strong> Now, here's my question:</p>  <p>Let's say, I want to check if my UIInterfaceOrientation = Landscape (Left | Right) should I use it like this:</p>  <pre><code>[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation ==      (UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft |       UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight) </code></pre>  <p>OR</p>  <pre><code>[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation &amp;      (UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft |       UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight) </code></pre>  <p>Should they give the same result? Or different? Which one is more appropriate?</p>  <p>(In my simple mind, if it's not wrong then the second one is more appropriate).</p>  <p><strong>BONUS QUESTION</strong></p>  <p>Other than enums, is there anywhere else where I can use bitwise, bitshift operator effectively?</p>
