<p>I have two lists a master list and a subset of that list, I want to compare the master to the subset and then insert nulls where the subset is missing in python.</p>  <p>There is a need for the value to be separated after a pipe but it is not important when comparing the two lists.</p>  <p>Master list</p>  <pre><code>["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"] </code></pre>  <p>Subset</p>  <pre><code>["A|1" , "D|41", "F|34", "F|54"] </code></pre>  <p>Desired outcome</p>  <pre><code>["A|1","NULL","NULL","D|41","NULL","F|34", "F|54"] </code></pre>  <p>Any help welcomed.</p>
