<p>I have two files which are very large in size say 50000 lines each. I need to compare these two files and identify the changes. However, the catch is if a line is present at different position, it should not be shown as different.</p>  <p>For eg, consider this<br> File A.txt  </p>  <pre><code>xxxxx yyyyy zzzzz     </code></pre>  <p>File B.txt</p>  <pre><code>zzzzz xxxx yyyyy   </code></pre>  <p>So if this is the content of the file. My code should give the output as xxxx(or both xxxx and xxxxx).</p>  <p>Ofcourse the easiest way would be storing each line of the file in a</p>  <pre><code>List&lt; String&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and comparing with the other</p>  <pre><code>List&lt; String&gt;. </code></pre>  <p>But this seems to be taking a lot of time. I have also tried using the DiffUtils in java. But it doesnt recognize the lines present in diferent line numbers as same. So is there any other algorithm that might help me?</p>
