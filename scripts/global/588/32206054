<p>I have 2 text files. They have a lot of rows, but both have the same number of rows. They contain key value pairs. The value is different for some rows (the key remains the same).</p>  <p>How can I get the number of rows that are different? I used winmerge just now to compare, but if there are multiple different lines after another, it shows it as one difference and it only shows the number of differences.</p>  <p>I would like a tool that does what I said above but also gives me access to have a nice visual output of which rows are different.</p>
