<p>I am wondering about the best approach to the below</p>  <p>I have a .NET Web application and I am changing the ORM provider I am using.  To do this I have created a new solution and removed the previous ORM and implemented my new one.  As there are lots of existing screens that work with the previous ORM I want to make sure that the same object is returned by both ORMS.  As these are in two separate VS slns is there a simple way I can compare the complex objects that all the same properties have been loaded on to the object graph.  I could set a breakpoint and compare them manually but I don't really want to do this? </p>
