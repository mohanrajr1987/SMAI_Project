<p>What mistake do I have below in the code could you please explain? I have button which has tag property that set 3 and interval also 3, which means 3 == 3 must be true but <code>if</code> is not working.</p>  <pre><code>[_busyButtons enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id  _Nonnull obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL * _Nonnull stop) {     UIButton *button = (UIButton *)obj;     int a = (int)button.tag;     int b = (int)interval;     if (a == b) {         button.selected = YES;     }  }]; </code></pre>  <p>details : ios9, xcode 7.0 </p>
