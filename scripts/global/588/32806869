<p>I have Two Arrays in MATLAB, Say A and B contains random values as below. Both arrays A and B always contain a pair; 2,4,6 or 8 or more elements (even number only) and A always has less elements than B. And elements in both arrays are pre-sorted.</p>  <pre><code>A=[152 271]; B=[107 266 314 517 538 732]; </code></pre>  <p>I want to check the range of values of all pairs (one pair, 152-271 in this example) in A against all pairs of B. And expand/modify the values of pairs of B as such, if it exceed the B values. In this example, first to compare pair 152-271 of A with first pair of B (i.e. 107-266). As 152 is greater than 107, and 271 is greater than 266. We will modify 266 values of first pair of B with 271 to wholly include the range of first pair of A within B. Both intervals (range) in A and B should somewhat overlap to modify the B values.We will stop when there are no elements to check in A. The end result will be like this:</p>  <pre><code>A=[152 271]; B=[107 271 314 517 538 732]; </code></pre>  <p>In this image below Green,Rad and Yellow represent A,B and final B (only modified) values respectively.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v5eeP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v5eeP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
