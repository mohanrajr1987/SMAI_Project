<p>I know the <code>is</code> operator compares the id of the two, not the value<br> However when you evaluate id(1) and id(1), the object (which is an int) is equal to one another.</p>  <p>So why is it returning false?</p>  <pre><code>id(1) # 27533656 id(1) is id(1) # False type(id(1)) # int </code></pre>  <p>so then, technically, deduce it to</p>  <pre><code>id(1) is id(1) 27533656 is 27533656 # has to be True! </code></pre>
