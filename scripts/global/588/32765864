<p>I am hoping somebody can help me out here and that this questions won't be too vague.</p>  <p>I am trying to determine a way that I can highlight the differences between two text strings within a winform.</p>  <p>I have the original string in one column of a data grid and the string to compare to in a second column.  What I would like is to highlight where the comparison string is different within the data grid view itself.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p><code>Thanks for the hep</code></p>  <p><code>Thanks for the help!!</code></p>  <p>where the <code>l</code>, and two <code>!</code> would be highlighted</p>  <p>I have tried the following (Shout out to Bouam for his help in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27722360/how-to-compare-2-rows-in-a-datagridview-and-highlight-the-different-cells" title="Previous Post">Previous Post</a>):</p>  <pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; TextProcessingResults.RowCount; i++) {     if (TextProcessingResults.Rows[i].Cells[1].Value != null)     {         if ((string)TextProcessingResults.Rows[i].Cells[1].Value != (string)TextProcessingResults.Rows[i].Cells[2].Value)         {             TextProcessingResults.Rows[i].DefaultCellStyle.ForeColor = Color.Red;         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>But this only highlights which rows are different not at the character level. I'm new to all of this, so is this a crazy endeavor to undertake?  </p>  <p>Could anybody help or point me towards a resource that would be useful?</p>
