<p>I am trying to compare two .xsd files to find differences in elements.</p>  <p>For example, "file1.xsd" and "file2.xsd". If <strong>either</strong> of these contained the following: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;complexType name="ComplexType1"&gt; &lt;element name="ElementName1" type="int" maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0"&gt;     &lt;annotation&gt;         &lt;documentation&gt;             Text here         &lt;/documentation&gt;     &lt;/annotation&gt; &lt;/element&gt; &lt;/complexType&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and the other one did not, I would want to be notified (for example just having the names of elements which are not in both .xsd files listed in a txt file in the form "Complex type, element name").</p>  <p>Furthermore, if "ElementName1" is under "ComplexType1" in file1, but under a different complex type in file2, I would also like this to be included.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
