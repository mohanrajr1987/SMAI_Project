<p>How do I compare a string with multiple words in an if/then statement? I tried this:</p>  <pre><code>System.out.println("How would you describe your active lifestyle? Sedentary, Somewhat Active, or Active?");         String lifestyle = sc.next();         double activity;         if(lifestyle.equalsIgnoreCase("sedentary"))             {                     activity = 0.2;             }         else if(lifestyle.equalsIgnoreCase("somewhat active"))             {                 activity = 0.3;             }         else             {                 activity = 0.5;             } </code></pre>  <p>But when you enter "somewhat active", it assigns the variable activity to 0.5. How can I get it to register that "somewhat active" is a thing?</p>
