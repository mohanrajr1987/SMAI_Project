<p>I have created Objective-C project and used CocoaLumberjack framework to capture and send logs file. But now I created swift project and want to use Objective-C classes in Swift project. To do so, I created bridge header and added CocoaLumberjack framework also. But the problem is its capturing NSLOG only, It's not capturing println statements in logs file.</p>  <p>How to do this?. I want to capture both NSLOG and println.  </p>
