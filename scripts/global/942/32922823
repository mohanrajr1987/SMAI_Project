<p>I've converted a console app into a scheduled WebJob.  All is working well, but I'm having a little trouble figuring out how to accomplish the error logging/emailing I'd like to have.</p>  <p>1.)  I am using Console.WriteLine and Console.Error.WriteLine to create log messages.  I see these displayed in the portal when I go to WebJob Run Details.  Is there any way to have these logs saved to files somewhere?  I added my storage account connection string as AzureWebJobsDashboard and AzureWebJobsStorage.  But this appears to have just created an "azure-webjobs-dashboard" blob container that only has a "version" file in it.</p>  <p>2.) Is there a way to get line numbers to show up for exceptions in the WebJob log?</p>  <p>3.) What is the best way to send emails from within the WebJob console app?  For example, if a certain condition occurs, I may want to have it send me and/or someone else (depending on what the condition is) an email along with logging the condition using Console.WriteLine or Console.Error.WriteLine.  I've seen info on triggering emails via a queue or triggering emails on job failure, but what is the best way to just send an email directly in your console app code when it's running as a WebJob?</p>
