<p>I am trying to log the <code>event name</code> and <code>parameter</code> for each each event on my Node server. For this purpose i used</p>  <pre><code>io.use(function(socket, next){   // how to get event name out of socket. }); </code></pre>  <p>Now, i got stuck while trying to get event name and arguments. To me, it looks like common demand from API dev, so i am pretty sure there must be some way in library to get that, i have tried to read the docs and source but i am not able to get the stuff.</p>
