<p>According to <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#substituteLogger" rel="nofollow">this FAQ</a>, it is possible to use logging before the logger is initialized, and slf4j will use a <code>NOPLogger</code> that just does nothing with the message.</p>  <p>Is there a way to wait until SLF4J implementation, particularly log4j, is fully initialized and ready to write the logs? I need that to make sure that <code>NOPLogger</code> is not used.</p>
