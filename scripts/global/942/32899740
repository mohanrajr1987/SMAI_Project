<p>Need to run a Oracle trace on  Linux server "A" but i don't have enough space. Trace file could be 25gb in size. Need script to move/rename the ora_00406.trc file in server "A" every 15 minutes and scp file ora_00406.trc_date with a unique name or date to  server "B". If Oracle does not see the file ora_00406.trc in Server "A" it will create a new file by that name.</p>  <p>I can create a cronjob to run every 15 minutes.</p>
