<p>How can I set NLog file name based on static variable in my application. </p>  <p>I have windows service that performs different tasks. Reads configuration file with task details.  I would like to create log file based on given task name. </p>  <p>NOTE: class name will not work, since all the tasks call the same code. </p>  <p>NOTE: I am already using ${logger} variable as my current class. Since I need to know where I am as well. </p>  <p>-------------UPDATE--------------</p>  <p>Seems like this is not possible to do.  Modified question: How to set variable values at run time? I am talking about this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;variable name="logFileName" value="" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thank you. </p>
