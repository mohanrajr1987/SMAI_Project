<p>I'm chinese.I'm reading syslog.h,and i find a term "0-big number" which i can't understand.I can understand the hole paragraph meaning,but i'm still curious about the term "0-big number",could anybody explain the term?</p>  <pre><code>/* * priorities/facilities are encoded into a single 32-bit quantity, where the * bottom 3 bits are the priority (0-7) and the top 28 bits are the facility * (0-big number).  Both the priorities and the facilities map roughly * one-to-one to strings in the syslogd(8) source code.  This mapping is * included in this file.  /* facility codes */  #define LOG_KERN    (0&lt;&lt;3)  /* kernel messages */  #define LOG_USER    (1&lt;&lt;3)  /* random user-level messages */ .... */ </code></pre>
