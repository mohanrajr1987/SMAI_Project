<p>We are maintaining two different log files, one to log only error messages, and other for debug information. I don't want to clutter the error file with exception stack trace, so I have to add following two lines each time on catching any exception</p>  <pre><code>try{   ... } catch(Exception e){    log.error("Error during SOME_SERVICE {}" , e.getMessage());    log.debug("Exception ", e); } </code></pre>  <p>Is there any simpler way to do this, may be in a single line of code? </p>
