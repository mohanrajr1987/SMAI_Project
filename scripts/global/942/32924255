<p>Is there a quick and easy way to send logging messages somewhere to remote? We have a major issue in our Android app that reproduces only on customer's device. We have no remote logging tool integrated in the app and need some very fast way to send <em>trace</em> logs somewhere to have an ability to view them after the bug reproduces.<br> Would be perfect to have some kind of remote server receiving HTTP requests like: <a href="http://log.com/msg=log_message" rel="nofollow">http://log.com/msg=log_message</a> and putting all the messages in the log file.</p>
