<p>We have multiple web apps(war) deployed to weblogic cluster. We are using logback and slf4j logging. We also have weblogic.xml packages in each war to tell weblogic to use packeaged version of slf4j so that it does not conflict with the one in weblogic classpath.</p>  <p>What we want to do is create war file specific log file and print all logs from that war to that log file.</p>  <p>We have POC where one application specific log goes to one file but things gets tricky when we deploy more than one war file.</p>
