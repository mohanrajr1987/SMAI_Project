<p>I have made a Powershell script to extract the Application &amp; System logs from remote servers in different domain. Script works perfectly! However, I am having issues with the exported file. When I try to open the log file in event viewer, I get a message saying that the <strong>log file is corrupted and unreadable</strong>. Below is a part of the script:</p>  <pre><code>$apppath = "\\server01\D$\temp\Automated_Logs\applog_" + $server + ".evtx" Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{ logname = 'Application'; StartTime = $start; EndTime = $end } -ComputerName $server -Credential $c | Out-File -FilePath $apppath  </code></pre>  <p>Server OS: Windows Server 2003/2008</p>
