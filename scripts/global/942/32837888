<p>I'm using Log4Net in C# and I want to block multiple writing of same consecutive messages to log. I have couple of templates and I want to check them against the message by the starting with, also I want to log the first and the last message of the same pattern and in the last message write the number of times the message repeated. Is Log4Net able to do that? Thank you all!</p>
