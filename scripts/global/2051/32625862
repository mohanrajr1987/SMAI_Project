<p>There are multiple tutorials about authentication in Bluemix, but I yet to find a good tutorial about authorization. In my mobile app, I need to group users and only users with a group get to see the messages allowed to this group. Is there a service can help to implement this?</p>  <p>Someone mentioned Stormpath in the forum, it  has built in features for user registry, login, authorization etc, which is what I need. Does it work with mobile app? is it free to use with Bluemix? It has tutorial to integrate with node.js, assume that works with Bluemix?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>Zheng</p>
