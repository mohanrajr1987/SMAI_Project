<p>I have an issue that has been puzzling me for a while now. I've managed to reduce as much as I can.</p>  <p>I have a standard <code>System.Web.Http.ApiController</code> with a Get method that simply returns <code>Ok();</code></p>  <p>The controller is marked with <code>[WindowsAuthorize]</code> which is a custom attribute of own creation. Currently, this attribute is reduced to this:</p>  <pre><code>public class WindowsAuthorizeAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute {     protected override bool IsAuthorized(HttpActionContext actionContext)     {         return false;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Now, using Postman, when I make a <code>GET</code> request to my endpoint with the following header, I get:</p>  <pre><code>Accept: application/json //Status: 401, Body: { "Message": "Authorization has been denied for this request."} </code></pre>  <p>Same request, but with the protobuf header:</p>  <p>Now, using Postman, when I make a <code>GET</code> request to my endpoint with the following header, I get:</p>  <pre><code>Accept: application/x-protobuf //Status: 500, Body: (empty) </code></pre>  <p>Somehow, the <code>401</code> becomes a <code>500 Internal Server Error</code>, but I get no exceptions server side. Am I doing something obviously wrong here, or how can I debug this?</p>  <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but the correct behaviour is to return <code>401</code>, then the client should try again with NTLM auth enabled, right? (Assuming commented the full code back in)</p>
