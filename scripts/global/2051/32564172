<p>I have an app with admins and normal users (two separate models). Both can upload files. Currently, the file model does not have an attribute of <code>uploaded_by</code> or or any associations with the <code>Admin</code>/<code>User</code> models. Once a file is uploaded by someone, it's just added to the overall list and everybody sees/can delete everything. I need this:</p>  <ul> <li>admins continue to see/be able to delete everything;</li> <li>users can see/are able to delete only their own files, files, uploaded by admins, but not files, uploaded by non-admins;</li> </ul>  <p>I would like to ask for advice on how to implement this.</p>  <p>I could add a polymorphic <code>belongs_to</code> for files and then do a query like - <code>File.where(owner: current_user) + File.where(owner_type: 'admin')</code>.</p>  <p>I am ok with rolling my own system or using something like <code>punidt</code> or <code>cancancan</code>.</p>
