<p>Two different groups of people plan to use our hadoop cluster, but I don't want them to see each other's data.</p>  <p>How can I prevent this functionality on hadoop cluster ?</p>  <p>I understand that if you set a environment variable you can easily impersonate the hadoop superuser and access all data in HDFS. Is there an simpler way to prevent this or kerberos and ldap based security is the only way to go?</p>
