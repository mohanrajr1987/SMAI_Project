<p>I'm developing an ASP.MVC application and I need to add some authorization mechanism to allow users access some controllers, actions, entities and feilds. I need to allow admin user to modify rights as well.</p>  <p>For example i need:</p>  <ul> <li><p>allow role MyRole1 to access MyPage1 (MyController1)</p></li> <li><p>allow role MyRole2 to access MyPage1 and execute MyController1.MyMethod1 to access array of entities MyEntity1 with fields MyEntity1.Field1,MyEntity1.Field2</p></li> <li><p>allow role MyRole3 same as MyRole2, but with fields MyEntity1.Field1, MyEntity1.Field3</p></li> </ul>  <p>which way is best to do it? </p>
