<p>I have a Web API 2 app using windows auth. I have multiple controllers and this in my web.config for authorization:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;system.web&gt;     &lt;compilation debug="true" targetFramework="4.5" /&gt;     &lt;httpRuntime targetFramework="4.5" /&gt;     &lt;authentication mode="Windows" /&gt;     &lt;authorization&gt;       &lt;allow users="AllowedUsersAndGroups" /&gt;       &lt;deny users="?" /&gt;     &lt;/authorization&gt;     &lt;sessionState mode="Off" /&gt;   &lt;/system.web&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This "blanket" authorization works great, <strong>but I have 2 specific controllers that I need to lock down differently: I want to specify different users that are authorized to hit these 2 controllers</strong>.</p>  <p>The obvious answer would be to use the <code>[Authorize()]</code> attribute on the controller classes, however I cannot use this attribute because I am using per-environment (Dev-UAT-Prod) XML transforms to the web.config and need to be able to change which users are authorized on these controllers in each environment.</p>  <p>So, is it possible to specify authorization for individual controllers in my web.config file?</p>  <p>I am open to other solutions as long as they allow for Authorizing different users when the app is deployed in each environment (dev-uat-prod).</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
