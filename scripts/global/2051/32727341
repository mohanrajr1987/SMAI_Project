<p>My JavaScript contained in script tags within my ASP.NET MVC runs perfectly, however, if I add the Authorize keyword in my controller, the JavaScript does not run.  Unfortunately, I haven't found any references to this issue online. </p>  <p>Here is my controller:</p>  <pre><code>namespace PROJECT.Controllers {    [Authorize]    public class HomeController : Controller { </code></pre>  <p>The same problem occurs if I add the Authorize keyword on particular controller methods, rather than universally like above.   I'm not sure how to use the Authorize keywork, or an alternative, and enable the JavaScript to run.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
