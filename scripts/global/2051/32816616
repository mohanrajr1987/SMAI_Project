<p>I am developing an erp system using mvc5. i have my own membership system built and user and his user permission is kept in a session variable once a user logged in. Authorization part is almost done i suppose. But for authentication now im trying to restrict access for unauthenticated users. I tried it like this</p>  <p>in my web.config</p>  <pre><code>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt; &lt;forms loginUrl="~/Login/Login" timeout="2880" /&gt; &lt;/authentication&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>and on controllers i put [Authorize] attribute.</p>  <p>This works fine for unauthenticated users. They are redirected to login page. But this restricts the access of authenticated users as well.(This means neither unauthenticated nor authenticated user can access the controllers which has authorize attribute). </p>  <p>If i remove authorize attribute it gives me an error since there is no user to be assigned to session variable. This implies that without authorize attribute unauthenticated user can access the controllers even-though the web.config has been modified.</p>  <p>I think this involves creating a custom attribute. But i don't know how to approach this. All help appreciated. Thanks in advance! </p>
