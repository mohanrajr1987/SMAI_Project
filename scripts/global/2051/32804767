<p>I'm moving over from web dev and into Android for a project I'm ever so inspired to build and was wondering what the best practice is to authenticate and authorize users in Android?</p>  <p>For example, say I have an Activity to log a user in. What is the best method to make sure that he/she can only access other Activity's designated for authorized users? And, would it be better or worse generally speaking to employ Google Plus or Facebook for such a task? </p>  <p>There doesn't seem to be much material online covering this topic... Thank you!</p>
