<p>I am trying to implement CustomAuthorization via IsAuthorized method of AuthorizeAttribute.</p>  <p>Assumption here is by this time user would have been Authenticated and i can retriev userName and other Claims that were assigned to user during authentication. I am using Bearer Authentication.</p>  <p>But when i check for actionContext.RequestContext.Principal.Identity.IsAuthenticated it is always returning false.</p>  <p>How do i access who the user is and any claims that were assigned to him during authentication in this method?</p>  <p>Here is the code that i am referring to, this is not the full blown implementation, incomingPrincipal.Identity.IsAuthenticated is always false.</p>  <pre><code> public class CustomAuthorizeAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute     {         protected override bool IsAuthorized(HttpActionContext actionContext)         {              IPrincipal incomingPrincipal = actionContext.RequestContext.Principal;               if (!incomingPrincipal.Identity.IsAuthenticated)                 return false;             else             {                 return true;             }             Debug.WriteLine(string.Format("Principal is authenticated at the start of IsAuthorized in CustomAuthorizationFilterAttribute: {0}", incomingPrincipal.Identity.IsAuthenticated));          }      } </code></pre>
