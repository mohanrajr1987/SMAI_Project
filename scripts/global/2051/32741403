<p>I've created controller classes to assist with Role authorization.</p>  <p>I have a base class <code>ControllersAuthorities</code>, which is the highest level of authority. I have created the other classes to extend each base class.</p>  <pre><code>[Authorize(Roles = "Owner")] public abstract class ControllerAuthorities:Controller { } [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] public abstract class AdminController:ControllerAuthorities { }  [Authorize(Roles = "Employee")] public abstract class EmployeeController:AdminController { } [Authorize(Roles = "Sales")] public abstract class SalesController:EmployeeController { } </code></pre>  <p>First question, will the <code>Owner</code>, <code>Admin</code> and <code>Employee</code> Roles have access to the <code>SalesController</code>?    </p>  <p>When implementing these classes in my project controllers. If I leave the <code>[Authorize]</code> uncommented, will this override the inherited authority Role?</p>  <pre><code>//[Authorize] public class AccountController:ControllerAuthorities { </code></pre>
