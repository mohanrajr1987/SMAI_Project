<p>I have two WCF services (A and B) with Digest Authentication, and service A call an operation from Service B.</p>  <p>When I call Service A, the client provide the credentials and I can call my method without problems. The same credentials access the Service B.</p>  <p>But when inside Service A, in the moment I need to call Service B, is there a way to forward the credentials supplied from A to B?</p>  <p>Am I clear enough?</p>
