<p>I have created a mobile app that uses my web api (so I own both the app and the api). To do this, I have used oauth2 user credentials grant - as per: <a href="https://bshaffer.github.io/oauth2-server-php-docs/grant-types/user-credentials/" rel="nofollow">https://bshaffer.github.io/oauth2-server-php-docs/grant-types/user-credentials/</a></p>  <p>This allows a user to login to the app using there normal website credentials (username / password). The app then receives a bearer token from the website, this bearer token is used to interact with the web api.</p>  <p>My question is, how do I limit my web api so that ONLY my app can use it? At this moment, others could develop other apps that use my api as the app itself isnt authorized (its just using the username/password of the website users).</p>  <p>Do apps get given a unique id by the play store / iOS when published? that I can use to authenticate the app making the api requests?</p>  <p>Any help appreciated.</p>  <p>Cheers, Ollie</p>
