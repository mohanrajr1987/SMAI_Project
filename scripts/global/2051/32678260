<p>I have started a MEAN application and used a yeoman generator - <a href="https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack" rel="nofollow">angular-fullstack</a> and then used a <a href="https://github.com/MartyIce/generator-angular-fullstack-crud" rel="nofollow">angular fullstack crud generator</a> so I have a basic template ready and now I want to add custom authorization middleware to it so that I can assign different permissions for all operations to individual models/entities both on client(angular ui router way) and server. So, how do i start off, is there any module that achieves the same end result automatically or if anyone can give me a nice reference point to begin with i would solve this problem on my own.</p>  <p>Thank You</p>
