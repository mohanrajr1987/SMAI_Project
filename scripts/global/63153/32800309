<p>Hopefully the question is self explanatory, but just in case, this is what I am looking for:</p>  <p>I want to be able to paste a URL from a 3rd party site on my app and have it show the picture/video (whatever is there), or brief text of the source url/page, instead of just the URL link. Is there a way to do it in JavaScript using JQuery or Backbone or any other way?</p>  <p>For example, if you go to your Facebook timeline, or on Twitter, and paste a link like <code>www.nytimes.com</code>, it drops down automatically and shows the image and description of the NY Times home page and not just the URL.</p>
