<p>I want to append a backbone view to a <code>data-content</code> attribute on a div.  (Specifically, I want to send the view to a Bootstrap (v2.3.2) Popover).  </p>  <p>Every time I try to set the attribute, I just see that the popover text contains an <code>[object HTMLDivElement]</code>  I want the HTML dynamically drawn to show in that data-content attribute.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
