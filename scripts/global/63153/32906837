<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/CEpPA/6/" rel="nofollow">js fiddle demo</a>I have a Backbone application where I wish to trigger methods on the router with links like these</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="/2015/09/28/do-you-drink-whiskey"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/2015/09/29/do-you-drink-beer/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Using this code</p>  <pre><code>$(document).on('click', 'a[href^="/"]', function(e){  e.preventDefault();  var href = $(e.currentTarget).attr('href');  Backbone.history.navigate(href, {trigger: true}); } </code></pre>  <p>I try to capture any click on a link that begins with <code>/</code>, which my two links do. By passing the <code>trigger: true</code> option, I understand that I am triggering a route on the router.</p>  <p>In the router, I try to match anything that begins with <code>2015</code> (as I understand there is no need to put the initial <code>/</code>)</p>  <pre><code>var R = Backbone.Router.extend({     routes:{         "": "list",         "restaurants/:id": "restoDetails",         "2015/*": "matchAnything"     },     matchAnything: function(){         alert("yeah, match")     },     restoDetails: function() {         console.log('restoDetails', arguments);     },     list: function() {         console.log('list', arguments);     } }); new R; Backbone.history.start({pushState: true); </code></pre>  <p>The matchAnything method is not getting called when I click the link. Question: How can I use the router to match a link that begins with a date (like I have done with my links)?</p>  <p>Update, my version was based on <a href="https://github.com/bouzuya/backbone-pushstate-example/blob/master/public/scripts/main.js" rel="nofollow">this code</a> and, in the README.md of that github repo, there is a link to a working demo. </p>
