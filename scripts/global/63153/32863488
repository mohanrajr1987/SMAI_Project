<p>I have a generic view and 4 other views. I am using bootstrap tabs (nav-tabs) in the generic view. I want the other 4 views to be the content of 4 tabs in the generic view. As I am new to backbone and bootstrap I am not able to figure out how to do that. Also, I am using only views in backbone for now (which means, there is no model or controller). Would sure appreciate the idea of how to do this. Thank you.</p>
