<p>How might I go about making the above happen? For instance, if a user navigates to this URL:</p>  <pre><code>app.com/#search/test.com/index.html </code></pre>  <p>with this router set up in a controller to catch it:</p>  <pre><code>var searchRouter = new Marionette.AppRouter({   controller: searchController,   appRoutes: {     'search': 'init',     'search/:term': 'search'   } }); </code></pre>  <p>How would the function <code>search</code> be passed <code>term</code> inclusive of the <code>/</code> and everything that follows? In my current testing, it seems that this route isn't called at all when the search term contains a <code>/</code>.</p>
