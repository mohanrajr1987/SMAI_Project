<p>Parse.com has removed the <code>Backbone</code> style <code>Parse.Collection</code> from the JS SKD (from here <a href="https://parse.com/docs/downloads" rel="nofollow">https://parse.com/docs/downloads</a>):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>SDK no longer contains Backbone-specific behavior. Moving forward, the core SDK will not be tied to any single framework, but we will work with the community to produce up-to-date bindings like Parse+React. The major changes are the removal of Parse.Collection, and allowing Parse.Objects to act as event channels.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have a lot of code that uses parse.collection, both in web apps and node.js apps. What options do I have to replace this collections to something similar? or switch to another best practice? </p>  <p>for example, in the case of my web app, should I wrap the parse sdk in backbone to keep using this functionality? </p>  <p>thanks for your ideas</p>
