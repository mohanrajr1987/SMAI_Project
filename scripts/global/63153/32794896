<p>I want to create a Backbone model and store a collection of another model into its property. So, there are parent and child model. Each parent has one or more children stored as an array inside its property.</p>  <p>The JSON will be like this.</p>  <pre><code>Parent = {     name: 'Name',     age: 'Age',     children:         [{name: 'Name', age: 'Age'},         {name: 'Name', age: 'Age'},         {name: 'Name', age: 'Age'}] } </code></pre>  <p>I've tried to create both model and insert one inside the other but still has no solution. And I don't want to use parse or other server things.</p>  <p>So, is there any solution or better way to achieve that?</p>
