<p>In developing large html pages with plenty of nested div's I found myself debugging the closing <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags. To get around this I started using javascript:</p>  <pre><code>var div1 = document.createElement("div"); </code></pre>  <p>Then I would simply use <code>div1.appendChild(somethingElse)</code> to build the page, happy to never again worry about closing those DIV tags. As I progressed writing, I started enjoying making the html pages from javascript, letting the browser render the html from javascript.</p>  <p>Then my js code became unmanageable, with js all over the place. This brought me into looking at frameworks to get my code to the next level, which I have decided to incorporate backbone.js. This will help with developing a single page app. </p>  <p>To implement backbone.js, I needed a whole bunch of up to date tutorials and books.  It seems like all tutorials are recommending template language/library like handlebars, ejs, jade, etc.</p>  <p>I feel that this puts me back to debugging DIV tags.</p>  <p>My question then becomes can I choose to not use a templating language for the views and build the view using javascript? Did I miss a larger issue in wanting to do this? Any examples, tutorials, out there? </p>  <p>I guess I should add that I may want someone else to help with the code, so I know readability might be an issue, if not 'the' issue.</p>
