<p>How can I add a behavior to my view with a variable as an option? In my case, the variable I want to use is an option of the view, but, when I tried this:</p>  <pre><code>behaviors: {     prodMessage: {         profile: this.options.userdata.attributes._userid     } }, </code></pre>  <p>I get:</p>  <pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'attributes' of undefined </code></pre>  <p>I think that is because this take place in the construction rather than the initilization.</p>  <p>So, do you have any workaround to achieve this?</p>
