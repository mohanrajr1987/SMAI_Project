<p>In my Backbone view in Rails 4, I'm attempting to have Handlebars compile a template.  It needs to be available in the DOM before it can be compiled.</p>  <pre><code>var ItemsView = Backbone.View.extend({   template:  Handlebars.compile($("[data-name=items]").html()),    render: function() {     this.$el.html(this.template({ items: this.collection.toJSON() }));   },   initialize: function() {     this.$el = $("#items");     this.listenTo(this.collection, "change", this.render);   } }); </code></pre>  <p>When I run this in the browser, Handlebars compiles fine, but when I run my Jasmine spec on this--providing it with a fixture--the fixture gets loaded AFTER the Backbone View starts to execute and thus I get, <code>Error: You must pass a string or Handlebars AST to Handlebars.compile. You passed undefined</code>--no script tag (in this case) is available to be compiled.</p>  <p>It was suggested <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12736727/testing-backbone-views-with-jasmine">here</a> that the template should be made into a function so that it could be invoked later, after the DOM is loaded, but I'm not sure if that is the best thing to do b/c I have to change my code to "make Jasmine work" even though the functionality works fine with the browser.  I did actually try that out (&amp; <code>loadFixtures</code> worked fine), but in subsequent tests, I run into the same problem--namely,...</p>  <p>...needing to attached the HTML fixture to the DOM BEFORE the <code>template</code>'s Handlebars compilation process needs to begin--before the spec starts to run on the Backbone View.</p>  <p>Here is my spec for this...</p>  <pre><code>describe('Items View', function() {    beforeEach(function() {     loadFixtures('index');     this.view = new ItemsView({       collection: items_scaffold // provided above     });   });    it("should have Handlebars template compiled", function() {     expect(this.view.template).toBeDefined();   });  }); </code></pre>  <p>I'm using <code>jasmine-jquery.js</code>.  On my Rails layout HTML file, I've placed <code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "application" %&gt;</code> at the bottom of the body, so I'm guessing it's not a "document ready" issue.</p>  <p>I've gone through the answers to a similar question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12715207/how-can-i-get-my-jasmine-tests-fixtures-to-load-before-the-javascript-considers">here</a>, but I can't seem to get them to work in my case.  Is there a plug-in that would enable attaching the fixture to the DOM before the jasmine spec begins to run--before <code>beforeEach</code>--or maybe a method in <code>jasmine-jquery.js</code> that I've missed?</p>  <p>Any help on this would be very much appreciated.</p>
