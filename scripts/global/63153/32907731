<p>this might be a simple question, but I've spent some time with it and I can't figure out what to do.</p>  <p>I've got a Backbone model and I'm trying to pass myData as an argument to MyModels in namedAttributes. Bind doesn't really help, since "this" is the context of namedAttributes, not RS.Models.MyModel. </p>  <p>Any suggestions? </p>  <pre><code>RS.Models.MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({      myData: {},      namedAttributes: {       "collection": _.bind(function(attrs) {         // "this" is the wrong context. How do I access myData from here?         var options = {myData: this.myData};         return new RS.Models.MyModels(attrs, options)       }, this)     },      initialize: function(attributes, options) {       if (options &amp;&amp; options.columnData) {         this.myData = options.myData;       }     }, }); </code></pre>
