<p>I am a big fan of angular and loves the two-way binding concept and the watch functionality.but my present firm is using Backbone Stack and i could not find a way to include Angular JS into Backbone Stack. (If there is a way . Well and good)</p>  <p>I want to do some UI manipulation based on value change of a simple variable.(Need not be a object).</p>  <p>And If possible i want to extend it a object 1 level deep like</p>  <pre><code> var watchObj = {    variable1 : 1,    variable2 : 2  } </code></pre>  <p>If any of the key-value pair change i want to do some UI manipulation(Depending on the  key ).</p>  <p>How can i achieve this with minimum possible javascript code.</p>
