<p>I've got a single page that needs to show multiple little boxes of the same collection sorted different ways.</p>  <p>Is there an event I can use to sort the collection just before rendering and use the same collection in all of the CollectionViews? Or should I make N copies of the collection sorted different ways and wire up the events myself?</p>  <p>I'd really like for all of the views to update when I add/remove an item from the collection.</p>
