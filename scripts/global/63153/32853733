<p>Have a backbone-driven app, and looking for some information on performance. At any point in time, the app is managing between 2,500 and 15,000 objects (specifically, models, spread across maybe 50 collections)</p>  <p>I'm trying to find details on what Backbone can handle (each object is generally quite small, with a small set of custom-methods available to it)</p>  <p>Any direction to look for this would be great.<br> Thanks</p>
