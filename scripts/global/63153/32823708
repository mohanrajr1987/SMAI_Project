<p>If you take a look at my code below you can see i have a organised array of models, collections and view. I have a function called includes thats concatenates all values from that object into one single array.</p>  <p>This is just me being a neat-freak...but some how some way need to generate the list of params in on the second require argument. </p>  <p>Here is my code.</p>  <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var files = {    models : [       'Models/BlogPost',       'Models/Tweet'    ],    collections : [       'Collections/BlogPosts',       'Collections/Tweets'    ],    views : [       'Views/BlogPostIndexView',       'Views/TwitterView'    ], };  var includes = function() {    return files.models.concat(files.collections,files.views); }  require(includes, function(BlogPost, BlogPosts, BlogPostIndexView,    Tweet, Tweets, TwitterView){ ... } </code></pre>  <p>Ideally I want my require method to look as follows...</p>  <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>require(includes, function(function(){return getParams()})); </code></pre>
