<p>I'm a noob on react/es6 stack/framework. I was previously developing in Backbone/Marionette.js and recently started reading more about ES6 and React. Considering my background I'm used to having Backbone for Model and Controller (MC of MVC pattern). I have heard people using react with Backbone/Ember/Angular. What are your experiences and what are the different patterns that are trending in this area at the moment. I'll really appreciate you sharing your experiences/thoughts on this. Thanks in advance!</p>
