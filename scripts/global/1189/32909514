<p>I have a jsbin here: <a href="https://output.jsbin.com/befapiyeyu" rel="nofollow">https://output.jsbin.com/befapiyeyu</a></p>  <p>When I zoom in in Chrome, Field 4 is stacked upon Field 5. It works normal in Internet Explorer 10.  I know browsers calculates zoom with floating point numbers, so the rounding differences could explain the break in layout, but I have no idea why it works in IE.  In the good old days it used to be the other way around: it was broken in IE and it was good everywhere else.</p>
