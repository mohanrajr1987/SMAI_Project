<p>I am using the newest version of Virtualmin on a fully updated VPS running Debian 8.</p>  <p>The VPS hosts 12 virtual Wordpress webpages. Every plugin in Virtualmin is disabled except MySQL and Apache. I am using an external DNS. From Chrome i can access all the webpages but from Internet Explorer i can only access some of the webpages.</p>  <p>For example: in Chrome i have no problem accessing <a href="http://kolesterolmedicin.dk/" rel="nofollow">http://kolesterolmedicin.dk/</a> but Internet Explorer 9-11 says that the page cannot be displayed.</p>  <p>I have no idea how to start identifying the problem as Internet Explorer can't establish a connecting to the server so the log files are unaffected.</p>
