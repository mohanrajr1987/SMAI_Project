<p>Recently we found out great feature of CSS called object-fit. It works great for common browsers. Problem is of course with IE. We found polyfill that adds support for object-fit. In general it works really nice. </p>  <p>But our issue is - how to load this polyfill in optimal way? The goal of our project is to have it as lightweight as possible.  We tried to load this polyfill only for IE, but the problem is how to do it to target all versions of IE these days? We need to add this polyfill from IE8 to IE Edge. </p>  <p>We already tried conditional statements and it works fine, but we have problem with IE10 and above. </p>  <p>Is there a nice way to load both script and styles only for IE? </p>  <p>Any input on that case would be appreciated:) </p>
