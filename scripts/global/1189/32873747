<p>is it possible to emulate cordova project using <code>ripple-emulator</code>  (<a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple</a>) on IE? I already use it on Linux with Chormium/Firefox and it works fine, but I can't make it work for IE.</p>  <p>Any advice for that? Could you give me the steps to make it work?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
