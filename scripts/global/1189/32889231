<p>I've been working on this website for a very long time now and only now I've noticed a few things that are missing when you use Internet Explorer.</p>  <p>Have a look with me: <a href="http://reclameabcshop.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://reclameabcshop.nl/</a></p>  <p>If you visit that website on Internet explorer 11, you'll instantly notice that the cartoon character is blocking 1/3 of the logo. There's also some content missing from the css file, for example the arrows in the navigation, the search icon in the search bar and the right arrow to sign up for our newsletter.</p>  <p>I have no idea how to solve this. Added the following to the header:  Tried out: /* IE 11 only */ Tried to put the \9; behind a css code</p>  <p>I hope that this makes sense, if not then please, ask away.</p>
