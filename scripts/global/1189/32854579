<p>Internally we use ActiveX in order to navigate to intranet sites and utilize automation for some tasks.</p>  <p>We create our objects and navigate in like so:</p>  <pre><code>  var objIE = new ActiveXObject("InternetExplorer.Application");          objIE.navigate("https://internalSite/empid="+personnelID);          objIE.visible = true; </code></pre>  <p>An issue we are now running into is that we need to force this object to open the pages in "Edge" or jQuery will fail due to it emulating IE7 by Default.</p>  <p>The question is, is there a way to emulate the browser or its backwards compatibility through an Active X Control?</p>
