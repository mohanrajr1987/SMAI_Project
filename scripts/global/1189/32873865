<p>I have an angular application that makes HTTP GET calls to the server. It works fine on Chrome &amp; Firefox. However, I figured out that IE caches the GET response, and after I do a POST, I need to call the same GET request and get the new updated response but IE caches it. I want to disable caching just for IE. I tried using a </p>  <pre><code>'If-None-Match': '*' </code></pre>  <p>request header on my GET calls, but then that disables caching for everything. Is there a way to do that conditionally for IE only? Or is there another way to disable it?</p>
