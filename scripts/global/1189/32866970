<p>In our project, we are using IE11 with the IE9 meta tag. Because of which I am getting the error <code>'MutationObserver' is undefined</code>. I have 2 questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Is there any way we can use IE11 supported components with IE9 meta tag?</p></li> <li><p>Is there any alternative similar to MutationObserver for IE9 which I can use with minimum changes in my code and source repo?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Really appreciate your help and support!!</p>
