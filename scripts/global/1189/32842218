<p>I am using Selenium Webdriver with Java. I would like check to operation of IEdriver. The following code works fine while opening Firefox or Chrome. I want the script to work for Internet Explorer as well.</p>  <pre><code>System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver", "C:\\IEDriverServer.exe"); WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver(); driver.get("www.google.com"); driver.findElement(By.name("q")).sendKeys("abc"); driver.close(); </code></pre>  <p>I get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to find element with name == q (WARNING: The server did not   provide any stacktrace information)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I got the same phenomenon, when i use xpath or id in findElement method. How can I solve this problem in Selenium WebDriver with Java? Will be grateful for any help.</p>
