<p>I am looking into CSSStyleDeclaration in both IE 11 on W7 and latest Chrome. My markup is this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div style="padding:5px;min-height:70%"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that in Chrome it doesn't have min-height but IE shows it correctly. Can someone please explain why and if that's how it works what is a way of a reliable checking for height/width being specified in the style?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
