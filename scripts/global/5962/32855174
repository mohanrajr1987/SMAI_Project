<p>I have three branches: master, A and B.</p>  <p>Branch "A" and "B" should be independent to each other. After the pull requests, master got updated from A and B. Now, I have accidentally merged B into A.</p>  <p>Immediately, I have reverted this merge via <code>git revert -m</code></p>  <p>But now when I pull B into master, revert merge in A destroys changes from branch B. This is happening because of branch A have "revert merge B" commit.</p>  <p>How I can remove "revert merge branch B" and "merge branch B" commits? I tried to use git -rebase command, but it doesn't help me, git creates anthoer branch that is not in pull request.</p>
