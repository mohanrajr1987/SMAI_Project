<p>I would like to do a code search in a collection of repositories.  I would like to restrict my search using a pattern or naming convention in the repository name.  </p>  <p>1) I can limit my search by the organization.<br> Example: "user:google"</p>  <p>2) I can search a single repository directly. Example: "repo:google/devtoolsExtended test"</p>  <p>So, is it possible to search all repositories that begin with a pattern? Equivalent to: "repo:google/dev* test"</p>
