<p>I am having an issue rebasing the main development branch <code>master</code> onto my feature branch <code>crm-feature</code>. </p>  <p>I am attempting to do this using the normal method of <code>git rebase master crm-feature</code></p>  <p>When I do this I find that I get to a certain point in the rebase when <em>every</em> commit becomes a conflict.</p>  <p>Looking at the list of commits in Github I see all <em>my</em> commits (authored by me) and then commits from others then all my commits seem to be recreated for some reason. All these commits show like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zMWIL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zMWIL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So from newest at the top to oldest my commit log looks like this:</p>  <ul> <li>Commit from other contributor piccolax00</li> <li>Commit from other contributor piccolax00</li> <li>All my authored commits with the piccolax00 user committing them like the image above</li> <li>Commits from other contributors</li> <li>My original commits</li> </ul>  <p>So to summarise, I don't understand where the commits have come from by the piccolax00 user and how I can work around them as they seem to be the thing preventing me from rebasing my branch onto <code>master</code>. The branch was worked on whilst I was on holiday and before I left all my commits were sitting at the top as I was rebasing onto <code>master</code> periodically to give me the latest code from the main dev branch whilst replaying my work on the top every time.</p>  <p>I'm unsure if the branch has been rebased by the piccolax00 user already and what my options would be if that's the case?</p>
