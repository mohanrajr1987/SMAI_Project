<p>I was trying to fetch the number of active repositories in GitHub filtering by language. The <a href="http://githut.info/" rel="nofollow">http://githut.info/</a> informs that for JavaScript for example, the number of active repositories is almost 324k at actual date, but the advanced search ( <a href="https://github.com/search/advanced" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/search/advanced</a> ) fetchs different results. Every time I click on the button "search", the results vary a lot. It is a GitHub error or I am misinterpreting the results ? What is the correct number of active repositories for the JavaScript language ? Last search attempts results were:  1,165,044 - 1,113,619 - 1,562,297. </p>
