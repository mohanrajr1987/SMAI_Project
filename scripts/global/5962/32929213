<p>I have developed a php class which would be hosted on github and packagist. I have a created a <code>data.json</code> file to read/write credentials data.</p>  <pre><code>$data = array(     'access_token' =&gt; $access_token ); $data = json_encode($data);  if(is_writable('data.json')) file_put_contents('data.json', $data); </code></pre>  <p>When i install this package in my other app using <code>composer</code>, i get following error...</p>  <pre><code>file_get_contents(data.json) failed to open stream: No Such file or directory. </code></pre>  <p>I really want to save access_token to data.json which will be in vendor directory, so suggest me any good way to achieve this. Thanks</p>
