<p>I've used filter-branch in the past, but now I'm looking for a solution to expose a private repository's folder by forking it to allow me and others to create pull requests.</p>  <p>Say I have project A and project A has folderA, I need to create a fork B from A that only contains folderA in it.</p>  <p>What is a good way to do this? I can't find an easy solution without forking the entire repository and then applying a filter-branch.</p>  <p>Edit: the fork will be <strong>public</strong></p>  <p>Thank you :)</p>
