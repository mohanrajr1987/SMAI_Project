<p>In AppVeyor I would like to setup the build number with the release number from Github. That would be used for the AssemblyVersion patching.</p>  <p>I am using GitFlow, and have a release branch. In SourceTree I create a new Release, for example v1.2, which creates the branch release/v1.2. The 1.2 part I would like to use in AppVeyor.</p>  <p>Like, Build version format:{gitRelease}.{build}</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Z1jd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Z1jd.png" alt="Screenshot AppVeyor build nr"></a></p>  <p>for this to work, </p>  <ol> <li>I need to retrieve the gitHub branch name,</li> <li>Extract the release number from it,</li> <li>Put that in a variable {gitRelease}</li> <li>Run this before the assemblyVersion patching</li> </ol>  <p>But I cannot find how to do this.</p>  <p>For the build itself I have a build script, to sent the output (nuget package) to Octopus Deploy, so that means there is no Before build script section.</p>
