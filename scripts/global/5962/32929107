<p>I'm pretty new to GitHub. I've made an organization, repository, and team. Is there a way that I can give someone on a team the ability to pull requests but not merge them to the main thread? I ultimately want to allow someone to make changes but also want to have the final decision of whether the change is kept to go through me. The read permission doesn't allow people to pull requests, and the write permission allows people to merge directly onto the main thread. Is there anything in between I could do, or any other methods I could use?</p>
