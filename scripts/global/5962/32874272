<p>I am using Android Studio 1.3.2 under Windows 7 in combination with GitHub. I would like changes made (most often automatically) in some files (class, apk, bin, etc.) and directories (build, etc.) to be ignored. I have tried putting a ".gitignore" in the project folder and also using the "configure ignored files" button of the "version control" panel, but changes I would like to ignore still seem to get detected in the build folder for instance. Can anybody recommend the right way to do this? Regards, SV </p>
