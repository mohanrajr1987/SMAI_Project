<p>So I have a github repo which only had 1 brach (master) where I was doing all my work. It was all the files for a website. Now I have activated github pages for it which created another branch with some files which came in it by default. How can I copy all my files (from master branch) for my website and put it into the github-pages branch? That way I can push changes and view it live on the github page online. I'm new to git and would appreciate any help!</p>
