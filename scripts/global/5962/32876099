<p>I've trying to push my files into git, but it doesn't work.</p>  <p>This is what I've done before.</p>  <pre><code>git init git add . git commit -m "Start" git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git  </code></pre>  <p>The first <code>git push -u origin master</code> works.</p>  <p>After changing some files and trying to <code>git push -u origin master</code> again  it doesn't work. </p>  <pre><code>To git@github.com:denis89/gaw8d3.git  ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward) error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:denis89/gaw8d3.git' hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again. hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details. </code></pre>  <p>Also git pull doesn't work, because of unmerged files. Any ideas? </p>
