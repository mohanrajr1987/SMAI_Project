<p>I was just wondering if anyone could clear up some confusion I have about using GIT Large File Storage.</p>  <p>When creating your new repository, I know how to track certain files with Git Lfs track, but how do you specify where those files will be stored?</p>  <p>For example, in the project I am working on there are a number of png and wav files.  These are being tracked using Git Lfs track.  The Git Lfs website says that they are stored on a remote server, but I cannot find out where that information is in our repository.  </p>  <p>In addition, when a second user clones the repo, the project contains only pointers to the LFS objects. How can they find/use the url for the remote where the actual files are stored?</p>  <p>(We are using Bitbucket and a local system git for our repo.)</p>
