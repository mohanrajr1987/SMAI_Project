<blockquote>   <p><strong>Duplicate Edit:</strong> The linked questions do not have a github-based solution for this question.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I have browsed to a file on a commit that moved the file, what is the easiest way to navigate to the previous commit and location of the file?</p>  <p>For example, see the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/commits/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.ViewFeatures/ViewFeatures/HtmlHelper.cs" rel="nofollow">commit history on this file</a>.  The last entry on September 17 is the commit where the file was moved.  To find its previous location, I did the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Noted the initial commit date</li> <li>Went to the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc" rel="nofollow">front page</a></li> <li>Clicked on <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/commits/dev" rel="nofollow">commits</a></li> <li>Paged through to September 17 and found the commit</li> <li>Clicked on the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/commit/046cb976b3e899052a95387b72ea4bee6987bff0" rel="nofollow">commit prior</a></li> <li>Clicked <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/tree/046cb976b3e899052a95387b72ea4bee6987bff0" rel="nofollow">Browse Files</a></li> <li>Hit <kbd>T</kbd> to open the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/find/046cb976b3e899052a95387b72ea4bee6987bff0" rel="nofollow">file finder</a></li> <li>Typed <code>HtmlHelper.cs</code> </li> <li>Click the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/046cb976b3e899052a95387b72ea4bee6987bff0/src/Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.ViewFeatures/Rendering/Html/HtmlHelper.cs" rel="nofollow">first result</a></li> </ol>  <p>Is there a more direct way to do this <strong>using github webpages</strong>?</p>
