<p>It's for a class project, and we are supposed to fork a project, and then save it in the class folder (which is a private repo). Does this mean there will be "2" repos, the fork will kind of be untouched, and all the changes will happen in the private repo? </p>  <p>I ended up using git clone of the fork into the appropriate folder, but I'm worried this might be kind of redundant and I'll have two folders rather than one of the forked repo?</p>
