<p>I want to do a very little change of this tag: <a href="https://github.com/JPNavilo/Office-365-SDK-for-iOS/tree/v0.9.1" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/JPNavilo/Office-365-SDK-for-iOS/tree/v0.9.1</a> I can download this tag with pod, I can modify the actual branch with my fork and download it but I don't know how to modify an old tag and download in my project. Anybody knows how to do it? Thank you all.</p>
