<p>I'm picking up Angular for my own education. I've been following tutorials on CodeAcademy and PluralSight (namely the <em>AngularJS: Get Started</em> stream).</p>  <p>I'm sorry to be awkward here but I have two errors for two different projects. I didn't want to make two new topics as they're small but I can't get my head around it.</p>  <p><strong>Unknown Error</strong>  I know the problem but I don't know <em>why</em> it's occurring. I searched the site here and online and tried the suggested fixes but it did nothing for me, so I reverted back to the state I had it. I'm currently learning about custom services and trying to add one for a github viewer.</p>  <p>The error I get is:<code>TypeError: github.getUser is not a function     at Scope.$scope.search (script.js:39)</code>. I checked the line in the script and I can't see what is wrong (I followed it directly from the tutorial and none of the fixes online worked for me. Here is the code: <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/IipX8a09PzX4iUZdVutS?p=preview" rel="nofollow">http://plnkr.co/edit/IipX8a09PzX4iUZdVutS?p=preview</a></p>  <p>I think it's an error with my dependencies but I'm not sure why!</p>  <p><strong>JSON PROBLEM</strong> I decided to make a wee application to pull weather data from the site openweathermap. (I seen a different weather app on TutorialsPoint and wanted to try my own).</p>  <p>The JSON file can be found here: <a href="http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=Galway,ie&amp;mode=json" rel="nofollow">http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=Galway,ie&amp;mode=json</a></p>  <p>and my code can be found here: <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/RaMkbx1zqwlJsbZrwueQ?p=info" rel="nofollow">http://plnkr.co/edit/RaMkbx1zqwlJsbZrwueQ?p=info</a> </p>  <p>(It works grand when I host it locally with http-server, so I'm not sure why plnkr is giving out!)</p>  <p>It's when I try to access the deeper array (list), it fails to recognise anything. The upper array (city) is no bother however!</p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> I'm trying to learn Angular so there's no time constraint or anything. Even if you could help me see why I'm wrong, I'd appreciate it greatly!</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
