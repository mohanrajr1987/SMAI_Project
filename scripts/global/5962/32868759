<p>in my Company, we've got a lot of repositories in one private github organization (not accessible publically). Ideally, all developers should have read access to all repos in that organization, while just having write access to the repositories of their project. </p>  <p>For that, I've set up a couple of github teams (for each project). Each of that teams should have write access for some repositories (easy to configure in the repo settings) but read access for all other repositories. I'm struggling with this one, as I can only grant read access to each individual repository. This is not only painful (because we have a lot of repositories) but will also not automatically work when new repos are created. </p>  <p>Is there anything, I'm missing to set this up properly? </p>  <p>Thanks, Matthias</p>
