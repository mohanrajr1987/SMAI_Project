<p>I'm working on a data analysis tool in Python just for fun and I wanted to find out the amount of code in bytes written in every language by a user or an organisation.</p>  <p>The script is working fine but the problem is that the GitHub API endpoint outputs only around 30 repositories on both authenticated and non authenticated requests.</p>  <p>For example the endpoint <code>https://api.github.com/users/google/repos</code> outputs 29 repository json objects and <code>https://api.github.com/orgs/google/repos</code> outputs 26 json objects.</p>  <p>Obviously google has much more repositories than that, so how can I access them? I just want to get the URL of the repository for my script.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
