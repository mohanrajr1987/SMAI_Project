<p>I have a github pages set up with Jekyll (I build locally and only push <code>_site</code>) here: <a href="https://github.com/Eflores89/Eflores89.github.io" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Eflores89/Eflores89.github.io</a></p>  <p>However, with 2 posts (the first and second), the site is not linking correctly to the post. If I test locally with <code>$ jekyll serve</code>, all the posts work correctly.</p>  <p>I'm wondering if it's the amount of tags or the special unicode characters in each tag (although the other posts have the same characters and similar amount of tags). </p>  <p>I've tried rebuilding several times locally and pushing. Any idea as to why these links are broken? Is there a max limit for tags (folders) for github pages work?</p>
