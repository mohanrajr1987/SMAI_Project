<p>I have a <a href="http://github.com/maasha/biopieces" rel="nofollow">repo on Github</a> where I have included the Wiki as a submodule as described <a href="http://brendancleary.com/2013/03/08/including-a-github-wiki-in-a-repository-as-a-submodule/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, if I create a release, download, and unpack the tarball, the wiki directory is empty. Solutions?</p>
