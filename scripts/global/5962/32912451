<p>Can someone please explain how to correctly download files from Github and add them into your visual studio project?  I've searched online and have been unable to locate a tutorial or walkthrough for this.  All searches return results for using Github as a repository for your project and checking in or out your code.</p>  <p>In specific, I wish to use angular-datatables (<a href="https://l-lin.github.io/angular-datatables/#/gettingStarted" rel="nofollow">https://l-lin.github.io/angular-datatables/#/gettingStarted</a>) in my project but dont want to include the files using Bower.  Ive tried that route 5-6 times and wish to avoid the headache until they maybe integrate it fully with package manager as it has only served to mess up my project folders and files.</p>
