<p>My organization is making the transition from SVN to Git (hosted on GitHub) and we have basically adopted the git-flow branching model.</p>  <p>We have been using pull requests to merge between branches.   We use the GitHub web interface to process the merge and close the request.</p>  <p>Pull requests are merged with --no-ff.  So a merge commit will occur in the destination branch.</p>  <p>So....  We merge from <strong>develop</strong> to <strong>master</strong> often - so what happens after the merge is the develop branch will be both <em>behind</em> (due to the merge commits not being in master) and <em>ahead</em> (due to new work being done in develop).</p>  <p>Over many iterations, we end up with "develop branch is both 23 commits behind and 7 commits ahead of master" - which seems ridiculous.   Should we just not worry about this?  Should we merge manually and not through the GitHuib web interface?  </p>
