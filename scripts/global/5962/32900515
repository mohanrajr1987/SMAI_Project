<p>We would like to improve our code quality, but we’re working on legacy code and using Travis-CI now would trigger lots of changes that the team won’t be able to handle.</p>  <p>To improve code step by step, I was wondering if there is <em>a way to check only modified files</em>, or <strong>even better: just the modified lines</strong>.</p>  <p>We could get rid of inconsistencies as we code and switch to “all code coverage” once we feel we have the time for it.</p>
