<p>I manage my dotfiles using Git and GitHub as many of you does. I name the original files without a dot (e.g. <code>zshrc</code>, not <code>.zshrc</code>) so that I can recognize them in Finder and make their symbolic links with a dot;</p>  <pre><code>ln -s ~/.dotfiles/gitignore_global ~/.gitignore_global ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc # and so on... </code></pre>  <p>When I look their remote repository at GitHub website, the syntax highlight on my <code>gitconfig</code> and <code>gitignore_global</code> are invalid while othersâ€™ <code>.gitconfig</code> are properly colored. However, my <code>zshrc</code> has its syntax highlight though it does not contain a dot in its name.</p>  <p>I would like to highlight <code>gitconfig</code> and <code>gitignore_global</code> like <code>.gitconfig</code> and <code>.gitignore</code>. Is there any way to achieve this?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
