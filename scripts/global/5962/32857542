<p>I have large project in a git repo and I've open source certain parts of it. The open sourced parts have their own git repos in separate folders within the parent repo. However, as soon as I initialized a repo in one of the inner directories, those files are no longer added and tracked by the parent git repo.</p>  <p>I dont like this because the parent repo wont work if the child repos are on the wrong commit. This is a big problem if you want to go back in history. So I want to be able to track all files, including the files in the sub-repos in the parent repo. It seems easy enough. I dont want to use submodules or subtrees or anythign fancy. Simply duplicating the code between the two repos is fine by me.</p>  <hr>  <p>Edit:</p>  <pre><code>/proj1/.git /proj1/src/main.js /proj1/packages/subproj1/.git /proj1/packages/subproj1/helper.js </code></pre>  <p>When I'm in <code>/proj</code>, I want <code>git add .</code> to add both <code>/proj1/src/main.js</code> and <code>/proj1/packages/subproj1/helper.js</code> to <code>/proj1/.git</code>.</p>  <p>When I'm in <code>/proj1/packages/subproj1</code>, I want <code>git add .</code> to add both only <code>/proj1/packages/subproj1/helper.js</code> to <code>/proj1/packages/subproj1/.git</code>.</p>
