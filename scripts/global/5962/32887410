<p>So I have a Jekyll website being built by Travis-CI automatically after GitHub pushes and then published to Amazon S3.  It works great, but I would like to extend it a little further.  Basically I'd like to be able to detect which branch is being built and use that branch name to decide what S3 bucket to publish to, such as</p>  <pre><code>branch dev bucket myapp.{branchname} = myapp.dev  branch qa bucket myapp.{branchname} = myapp.qa  branch prod bucket myapp.{branchname} = myapp.prod </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible?  And if so, how?</p>  <p>Nick.</p>
