<p>I'm having some frustrations with Git. I was under the impression that Git will automatically take care of all the merging with the simplest 3 commands - "git add ." or "git add --all" -> "git commit -m 'Comment'" -> "git push origin master". But often we face problems after doing this like - having duplicate files (probably after moving some files in another folder), not being able to merge for some reason and the worst of all, working on the project you pulled yesterday, saving it, then trying to commit it to the remote branch when you get an git error message that the branch was updated and I have to pull the new changes and after pulling the new changes, get all your locally done progress be reverted back or overwritten completely without your personally added code.</p>  <p>I'm a bit frustrated, it seems that Git isn't something as easy to work with as I believed. I would appreciate some guidance.</p>
