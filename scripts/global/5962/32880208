<p>I'm writing a small library <code>L1</code> that depends on a third party library <code>L2</code>. <code>L2</code> has multiple versions that <code>L1</code> needs to be able to support. Each version of <code>L2</code> is bound to a given specific API and target JDK. I have no control over <code>L2</code>.</p>  <p>For instance :</p>  <ul> <li><code>L2-v1.x</code> -> I need to be able to provide <code>L1-v1.x</code></li> <li><code>L2-v2.x</code> -> I need to be able to provide <code>L1-v2.x</code></li> <li><code>L2-v3.x</code> -> I need to be able to provide <code>L1-v3.x</code></li> </ul>  <p>What would be the best way to organise code in git (what should I put in master / what branches / should I have multiple projects / multiple modules) knowing that I have to build the project using Maven and I want the build to be as simple as possible ?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>  <p>Edit: all versions of L2 are in Maven Central, all versions of L1 will have to be in Central.</p>
