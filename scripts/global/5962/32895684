<p>I have a rails app and need to check if a specific user is a collaborator on a Github project.  This is to verify if they are a stakeholder on a project so we can trust the information they provide us about the project.</p>  <p>Tried using the rails gem "omniauth-github" with Github API[1], but it appears one needs to be a repo owner to verify a user's collaborator status.</p>  <pre><code>GET /repos/:owner/:repo/collaborators/:username </code></pre>  <p>Can you please recommend how to check if a user is a collaborator on a project using Github API and omniauth-github gem? Ideally, a user would authorize the app to obtain a list of repos where that user is an owner/collaborator.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>[1] <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#get" rel="nofollow">https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#get</a></p>
