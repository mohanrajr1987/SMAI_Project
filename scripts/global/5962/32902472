<p>I would like to make my WordPress blog installed on Localhost to push into GitHub and run that on GitHub as a static page. Can I do it, and if yes please give me a detailed answer with the steps and problems involved?</p>  <p>I don't care if my page is static, but will I be able to host it on GitHub pages?</p>
