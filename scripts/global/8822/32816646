<p>With some compilers, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/8671366/1959975">using <code>pow</code> and certain other functions in a C program requires linking to the <code>m</code> library</a>. However, some compilers don't require this and would error out on linking to the <code>m</code> library. An almost identical situation exists for C++ with <code>std::thread</code> and <code>pthread</code>, but the CMake module <code>FindThreads</code> alleviates this entirely - is there some similar module for libm?</p>  <p>What is the best way to detect what to do with CMake? This is my current solution, which is less than ideal because there are many more C compilers than just GCC and MSVC:</p>  <pre><code>if(NOT MSVC)     target_link_libraries(my-c-target PUBLIC m) endif() </code></pre>  <p>This works for my purposes but I'm pretty sure there are cases where it would fail and require manual user intervention, which isn't fun for someone who doesn't know about this obscurity. Ideally I don't want the user to have to specify whether their compiler is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1033940/1959975">weird</a> or not via the commandline; I want to detect it automatically within CMake, since this is the entire point of CMake.</p>
