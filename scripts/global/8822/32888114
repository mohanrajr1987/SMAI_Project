<p>I am using QT Creator 3 with CMake. In my project there are a lot of subprojects which related to each other. My problem is that is some project I get an error in QT Creator at #include section that the specified header file does not exist (green underscore below the header file and "No such file or directory error" message when I put my cursor on the line). Sometimes it does with local header files (i.e. #include "header.h") sometimes only with header files from other projects (i.e. #include &lt; header.h >. <strong>But the building can be executed successfully so the cmake files are good only QT Creator can not find these files.</strong> So the building is good only I can not use the intellisense. The strange is that this situation is not with every subprojects only at same cases.</p>  <p>Do you have some idea how can I solve this problem?</p>
