<p>I'm using cmake to build an executable to run on an Intel Galileo board. </p>  <p>My question is how do I include the external mraa library in the build process. </p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa" rel="nofollow">Mraa library</a></p>  <ol> <li>When I download the library from git (1) do I need to build it as described here</li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/building.html" rel="nofollow">Mraa compiling instructions</a></p>  <ol start="2"> <li>What do I need to put in my CMakeLists.txt file to pick up the library? </li> </ol>  <p>This is what I have thus far in my CMakeLists.txt file but I believe it is incorrect. </p>  <pre><code>### MRAA ### add_subdirectory(mraa-master/src) file(GLOB mraa_SRC     "mraa-master/src/*.c" )  include_directories( "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/mraa-master/include"  ) add_library( ${MRAA_LIBRARY_NAME} SHARED  ${mraa_SRC}  ) </code></pre>  <p>Thank you</p>
