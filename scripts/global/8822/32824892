<p>Whilst building OpenCV 3.0 from source, using cmake, I'm not sure whether the ipp (intel integrated performance improvements) version provided in the 3rdparty directory includes all ipp related performance improvements, or if there is more to gain by linking to the (more complete) ipp directory contained within the intel student Parallel Studios XE cluster edition I have installed on my system.</p>  <p>For example, I have noticed that the lib directory for the ipp that comes bundled with OpenCV includes only one .lib file (ippicvmt.lib), whereas the lib directory for ipp in parallel studios contains many more .lib files (16 in total).</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>Thanks a lot, Dan</p>
