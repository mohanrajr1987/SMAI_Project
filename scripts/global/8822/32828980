<p>I am on Ubuntu 14.04.3 platform. While I was compiling a project it asked cmake version 3.2 which is not present in my system. I compiled the latest version of cmake from source code and installed it into /usr/local/bin directory. When I attempt to compile project again, its cmake detects the cmake in /usr/bin which is lower version. Then <code>cmake ..</code></p>  <p>process aborts with lower version error. Is there any built-in cmake variable or environment variable for setting path of the cmake?</p>  <p>EDIT:  I just found a cmake variable <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_COMMAND.html" rel="nofollow">CMAKE_COMMAND</a> that supposedly does what I want.  But when I insert <code>CMAKE_COMMAND = /usr/local/bin/cmake</code> line into cmakelist.txt then I go to <code>build</code> directory and issue <code>/usr/local/bin/cmake ..</code>  I get :</p>  <pre><code>  Expected a command name, got unquoted argument with text </code></pre>  <p>I searched for it on the net but didn't find a solution.</p>
