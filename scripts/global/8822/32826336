<p>I am following the instructions <a href="http://www.coolprop.org/coolprop/wrappers/Octave/index.html#octave" rel="nofollow">here</a> to use the CoolProp Octave wrapper for Mac OSX.  As it says, I have installed git, Python, CMake, and 7-zip.</p>  <p>I then follow the instructions under build.  When I execute the following command:</p>  <p>cmake .. -DCOOLPROP_OCTAVE_MODULE=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON</p>  <p>I get an error saying that it could not find a package configuration file provided by "Required".  The error is on line 144, shown here:</p>  <pre><code>if(UNIX)   find_package (${CMAKE_DL_LIBS} REQUIRED) endif() </code></pre>  <p>I looked up CMAKE_DL_LIBS in the CMake documentation and it says that it is the library with dlopen and dlclose in it, usually -ldl on most Unix machines.  </p>  <p>I'm sure I'm missing something basic but I can't figure what.  Is there a library that I am supposed to have on my computer that I am missing?  Thanks for the help!</p>  <p>Tim</p>
