<p>I'm using cmake on Ubuntu 14.04 to build <a href="https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX" rel="nofollow">pdf2htmlEx</a>.</p>  <p>It required building poppler version >= 0.25. I built poppler version 0.35.0.</p>  <p>After this I was getting a linking error due to the earlier version of poppler getting linked.</p>  <p>I fixed this by doing this:</p>  <pre><code>ln -s /usr/lib/libpoppler.so.54.0.0 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpoppler.so </code></pre>  <p>Basically pointing the poppler version here to the newly built version. This seemed like a hack.</p>  <p>My question is if I have two version of the same library, how do I make sure that "cmake" and "make" and "g++" (cmake was configured for poppler >= 0.25.0) finds the correct version? How do you correctly debug and fix such a linking error?</p>
