<p>I'm sorry if this question is already well answered, but I can't seem to get this working.</p>  <p>A have a C++ project that is built using CMake, that is not written by me but which my program depends. I can get the project compiled in Visual Studio, but I can't figure out how to setup the correct dependency.</p>  <p>In my own project, also written  with C++/CMake, how can I 'tell' CMake to "include" an external project as a dependency?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance : )</p>
