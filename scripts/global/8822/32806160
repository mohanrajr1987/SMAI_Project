<p>I need to link with a third-party pre-built shared library. On Windows, that means linking with <code>Third_party.lib</code>, and on Linux/Android, that means linking with <code>libThird_party.so</code>. So in the interest of cross-platformness, I tried to write that as:</p>  <pre><code>${CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX}Third_party${CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX} </code></pre>  <p>Which works fine on Windows, but on Linux/Android, these variables are blank. I get that Linux/Android doesn't have import libraries, but nonetheless these variables being blank is actually a big nuisance. And changing the variables to <code>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_...</code> doesn't work either, because even though Linux/Android would then look for lib/.so like I want, Windows will look for .dll, which I don't want.</p>  <p>It seems like I can fix this by populating the import library variables (only on Linux) with values from the shared library variables. But... is this really the best way? I can't possibly be the first person to bump into this.</p>
