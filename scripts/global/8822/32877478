<p>I am trying to compile libgit2 and followed the instruction on <code>https://libgit2.github.com/docs/guides/build-and-link/</code> but lock so far.</p>  <p>Can someone tell me what to do?</p>  <p>Here is the result from my command line:</p>  <pre><code>-- Building for: Visual Studio 12 2013 -- Could NOT find PkgConfig (missing:  PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE) -- Could NOT find ZLIB (missing:  ZLIB_LIBRARY ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR) -- zlib was not found; using bundled 3rd-party sources. -- LIBSSH2 not found.
