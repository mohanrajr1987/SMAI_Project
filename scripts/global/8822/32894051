<p>When building a CMake project (e.g. on Windows), I can perform a parallel build by executing the following command:</p>  <pre><code>cmake --build . -- /m </code></pre>  <p>The /m switch is passed to msbuild and I get parallelized builds.  However, if I have some external project in my CMakeLists, that switch is not passed through to its build command.</p>  <p>What's the best way to ensure my ExternalProject is built in parallel?  I don't want to hardcode a BUILD_COMMAND if I can avoid it.</p>
