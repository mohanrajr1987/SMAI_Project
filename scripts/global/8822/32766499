<p>I am working with c++ for mathematical academical purpose and found a useful package from 2003. And I need to estimate if this program is useful. (I am talking about the VISPACK library <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~whitaker/vispack/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.utah.edu/~whitaker/vispack/</a>) I will be working with windows7.</p>  <p>Is it so far realizable to use this project completely? Do I need to set all my compiling properties in CMake and Eclipse to a 2003 standard?? Or is it ok to use VS2010? Do you think it is "more work" or "not possible" ?</p>
