<p>I'm trying to build <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-cpp" rel="nofollow">Amazon's C++ AWS SDK</a> with g++ under 64 bit cygwin running on windows 8. When I call <code>cmake</code> from the build directory like so:</p>  <pre><code>cmake C:\Users\path\aws-sdk-cpp-master </code></pre>  <p>I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>You have called ADD_LIBRARY for library aws-cpp-sdk-core without any source                  files.  This typically indicates a problem with your CMakeLists.txt file  You have called ADD_LIBRARY for library testing-resources without any source files. This typically indicates a problem with your CMakeLists. txt file You have called ADD_LIBRARY for library aws-cpp-sdk-dynamodb without any source files.

This typically indicates a problem with your CMakeLists.txt file  You have called ADD_LIBRARY for library aws-cpp-sdk-identity-management without any source files.
