<p>I use Cocos2d v3.4 with Spritebuilder and I faced the following problem: when our gaming project becomes big enough, with a lot of graphics, sometimes my CCButtons' labels start to display a wrong stretched text (not the text from CCLabelTTF.string) and sometimes just black rectangle instead of the textfield. After this first glitch appeared, some graphics elements are displaying as stretched texts from another CCLabelTTFs as well. This issue is present on iPhone 6+, 5s and iPad Air 2, but everything is fine on iPhone 4s. Does anyone know how to solve this?</p>
