<p>I am using cocos2d-x on an iOS game. But I am getting some errors that are preventing the app to compile properly. Here's a screenshot to emphasize the issues:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cA6ke.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cA6ke.png" alt="Unknown Type Name Error"></a></p>  <p>Any ideas on how to fix those errors? I tried the Xcode suggested methods, like <strong>replacing class with Class</strong>, but this produces even more errors. Whatever Xcode suggested did not work. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N5IDp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N5IDp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
