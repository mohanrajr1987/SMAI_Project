<p>I need to build an app like Lumosity (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lumoslabs.lumosity" rel="nofollow">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lumoslabs.lumosity</a>) that is native app and have some game screens.</p>  <p>So the question is: Is there a way to build a cross-platform game that I could wrap it into a native iOS/Android app?</p>  <p>I've read about Cocos2D-x that is great to build the whole game but I found nothing about wrapping like GLView as a subView.</p>
