<p>I have simple Question about atan2() that how to get the angle from the the Turret so that it follows spaceship where it goes.</p>  <p>i have a vector which is from the Turret to SpaceShip but as of my knowledge atan2f gives the angle from the hypotenuse to 0 Degree line.</p>  <p>please correct me if i am wrong.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pPda6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pPda6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I want that angle highlighted as (blue) so that it follows where the spaceship goes.</p>  <p>Here is my Code:</p>  <pre><code>-(void) upDateTurret:(CCTime)delta{  CGPoint playerToCannonVector = ccpSub(_playerSprite.position, _turretSprite.position);  float angle = atan2f(playerToCannonVector.y, playerToCannonVector.x);  _turretSprite.rotation = 90.0f - CC_RADIANS_TO_DEGREES(angle); } </code></pre>  <p>this give me the correct result but how? as atan2f gives the angle which is from hypotenuse to 0 degree line(red angle).</p>
