<p>I have this win32 application. I created an installer for it and in my computer it works perfectly fine. I can install and run it. However, when someone I know tried installing it, the application ran but with user interface issues. <br> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F2Oa8.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F2Oa8.jpg" alt="This is how it looked like.

I didn't add the white boxes nor the weird lines. <br> Does anyone of you know the reason why this happened? I have no clue at all T_T. Is there a way to prevent this from happening again? <br><br> By the way, the UI was made using cocos studio. I'm using cocos2d-x for this app.</p>
