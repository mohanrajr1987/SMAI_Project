<p>I'm having an issue with the CCButton in cocos2d in the event when you hold a CCButton down (but do not let go) and open up an AdView (Though I'm assuming it could be any other view). When you close the view, and go back to the scene with the button, the button stays in a "selected state," but you can no longer make any touches on the screen. </p>  <p>What I'm looking for is to trigger the button's "touchCancelled" function, or something of the sort that would deselect the button being touched, and have it stop swallowing touches. Any other suggestions are welcome. </p>
