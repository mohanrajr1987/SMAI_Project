<p>I managed to build a Windows executable for my cocos2d-x game using the cocos console and Visual Studio 2015 Express C++.</p>  <p>The output, in the "Publish" folder, is my executable game and several <code>.dll</code> files. As well as the game resources. In other words, my game is not contained in a single <code>.exe</code>, which was my expected output.</p>  <p>Is it possible to build <strong>one single .exe file</strong> for my cocos2d-x game? One that has everything it needs contained?</p>  <p>The cocos console command I used for the build was</p>  <pre><code>cocos deploy -p WIN32 -m RELEASE </code></pre>
