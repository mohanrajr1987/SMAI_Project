<p>I'm confused - which approach is best in sharing data between Scenes in a Cocos2d project. The data consists of a set of integer variables that are not constant. These should be accessible throughout all the Scenes.</p>  <p>As I looked through the Web for solution, I found two basic approaches: 1) Singleton 2) A header file with global variables declaration</p>  <p>My question goes: which (and WHY) is better in my specific case?</p>  <p>The nearest topic I found is-  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/437122/what-is-better-global-string-or-singleton">What is better: Global string or singleton?</a>  but it doesn't really help.</p>
