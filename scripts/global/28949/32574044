<p>I am using Cocos2d 2.2, and am experiencing the following:</p>  <p>I have a sprite added as a child to a CCNode.  The sprite's anchor point is 0,0.  The CCNode's anchor point is 0,0.  The sprite looks peref I've got a CCNode with an anchor point of 0.5,0.5 and in it I add a child with the following rect:   0,363,165,231).</p>  <p>I then add that CCNode as a child to another CCNode with an anchor point of 0,0...</p>  <p>All is well..  Looks perfect.</p>  <p>I scale that CCNode down to 0.5</p>  <p>All of a sudden, I see at the top of my sprite, garbage from the texture that is not part of it's texture rect.</p>  <p>Why in the world does scaling down a CCNode change the texture coordinates?!</p>  <p>Note, if the CCNode has an anchor point of 0,0 this doesn't happen.  Only when its 0.5, 0.5...</p>
