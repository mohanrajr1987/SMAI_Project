<p>I'm a complete new user of Cocos2d, I've been using Unity for many days, but now I'm looking for a lighter engine to create a simple 2d drag and drop game for Android and iOS.</p>  <p>I'm using Cocos Studio, I've created the scene and the Sprites, but now I don't know how to animate them. I've viewed some tutorials, but I haven't understand so much. So these are some questions:</p>  <ul> <li>I've found almost all tutorials about Cocos2d-x but NOT about the Studio, so I'm wondering if the Studio is a complete IDE (like Unity) or only an editor for menus, sprites and animations...</li> <li>In the Studio, how can I create a script in javascript and attach it to the scene or the objects?</li> <li>Is there something automatic to manage gravity and collisions?</li> </ul>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
