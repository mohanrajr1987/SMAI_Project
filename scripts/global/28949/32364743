<p>The origin i.e - X and Y (0, 0) co-ordinates starts from bottom left of screen (Portrait mode). Is there a way I can move origin(0, 0) to center of screen. So, that I can differentiate when my sprite is on positive or negative axis on both X and Y co-ordinates ?</p>  <p>Or is there any other logic that could be used to know when sprite is either left or right side of screen ?</p>
