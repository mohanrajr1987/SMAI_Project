<p>As a way to learn cocos2d-x 3.x, I am porting various cocos2d-iphone projects to C++.</p>  <p>Found Ray Wenderlich's Mario/Koala tutorial. In addition to porting the existing code to C++, I adopted it for multiple window sizes.</p>  <p>Have a problem, that I don't know how to solve best. Ideas?</p>  <p>The code uses a custom physics engine, checking tiles surrounding the character for collisions once every update interval. Sometimes, a character falls through tiles. I suspect that it happens because the character is moving fast enough to pass through enough tile to be on the "other" size by the time, the update selector is called. I am thinking whether this is the case and what should be done:</p>  <ol> <li>replace physics engine with box2d or something,</li> <li>improve physics engine to keep last coordinate and to check whether it skipped a tile or tiles, and if yes whether a collision should have occurred,</li> <li>tune character speed bounds,</li> <li>something else clever. </li> </ol>  <p>Does it make sense that a simple collision detection system, checking only for collisions with surrounding tiles, could allow objects slip thru barriers?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
