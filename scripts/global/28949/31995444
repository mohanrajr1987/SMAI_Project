<p>I tried to upgrade my project to use cocos2d version 3.4 this morning.  I deleted all of the old library files.  Downloaded the newest version off the website and then pasted the "cocos2d" folder into my projects libs folder.</p>  <p>When I try to compile my project I get</p>  <p><code>'CCRendererSharedTypes.h' file not found</code></p>  <p>inside of CCShaders.metal</p>  <p>I don't understand why I am getting this because the file is definitely there.</p>  <p>This is the line causing the issue: <code>#include "CCRendererSharedTypes.h"</code></p>  <p>I have tried changing it to specify the path but that hasn't done anything.  Any suggestions?</p>
