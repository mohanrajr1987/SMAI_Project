<p>I am currently fixing up an old Cocos iPhone Xcode project for the new V 3.4 engine. It use to work absolutely fine, however I found this line of code:</p>  <pre><code>CCParticleSystem *fire = [CCParticleSystemQuad particleWithFile:@"fire.plist"]; </code></pre>  <p>CCParticleSystemQuad has since been removed therefore I replaced it with "CCParticleSystem":</p>  <pre><code>CCParticleSystem *fire = [CCParticleSystem particleWithFile:@"fire.plist"]; </code></pre>  <p>It kept crashing at that line of code with these error messages:</p>  <pre><code>- cocos2d: Couldn't find file:user_particle30956.png - *** Assertion failure in -[CCTextureCache addCGImage:forKey:], /Users/.../Source/libs/cocos2d-iphone/cocos2d/CCTextureCache.m:370 - *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:]: object cannot be nil' </code></pre>  <p>The image did not exist and was in fact embedded in the plist file as texture image data. I am aware that in Cocos V 2 it would automatically create and store this texture image data as an image file with a name. <strong>How can I make this work for V 3?</strong></p>  <p>I'm not sure how much information you need about the plist file. This is the info that follows a long list of particle system configurations (angle, duration, emitter type, etc):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;key&gt;textureFileName&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;user_particle30956.png&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;textureImageData&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;eJztnQecXWURxXdDgCCggBQLuisqKlbslcSCBcEC9pa1996wkbUr9q5...&lt;/string&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks, everyone.</p>
