<p>I have an old app (cocos2d game) with hard coded position and size values, optimized for the older screen size iPhone 4/5/iPad. </p>  <p>When the iPhone 6 came out, app store still accept the app built with iOS 7. I can simply submit the old app and it will automatically scaled up. Since it's a game app without navigation bar etc, scaling up looks pretty well actually. </p>  <p>But now app store requires all apps to build with iOS 8. Can I mimic the same behavior instead of changing the coordinate again? </p>
