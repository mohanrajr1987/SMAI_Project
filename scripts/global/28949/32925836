<p>i'm trying to run my app from my device (iphone 5) but i get this issue, someone can tell me what i've to do to make it right?</p>  <p>ld: '/Users/...../Documents/Myapp.spritebuilder/GoogleMobileAds.framework/GoogleMobileAds(GADGestureIdUtil.o)' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture armv7</p>
