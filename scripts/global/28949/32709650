<p>I use cocossharp. I want to add fade in/out transition when replacing scene. The fade in for the second scene works fine, but the current scene's fade out is not working. </p>  <p>My code for transition at GameStartScene.cs is:</p>  <pre><code>gameStartLayer.RunAction (new CCFadeOut (1.5f)); GameAppDelegate.GoToGameScene (); //director.ReplaceScene (new CCTransitionFade(1.5f, gamePlayScene)); </code></pre>  <p>How can I implement a fade out effect for the scene?</p>
