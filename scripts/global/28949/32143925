<p>Hello I have bought cocos2d game book and by following the book I have downloaded cocos2d 2.x but it has a lot of issues. Should I try to fix them or should do anything about it ? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9FswK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9FswK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
