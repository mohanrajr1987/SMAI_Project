<p>I have updated to bootstrap 3.  Previously I had a div which was a circle and inside that circle there was an icon which was taken from a glyph-icon. It was a perfect circle, now the circle is more of a round rectangle. If I have no icon in the circle, it will be a circle, but as soon as I put an icon into the circle it turns into a rectangle. This was not happening with the previous version of bootstrap. The jsfiddle has my current code. The fiddle will show a circle because I can't add a glyph-icon (of a check mark) into the fiddle, but if it was there (the class on the list tag, fa-icon-check, is what gets the icon) it would be a round rectangle instead of a circle. How can I get the circle to stay a circle when an icon is inside?</p>  <p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>  <pre><code>.icons-box {     text-align: center;     padding: 20px 10px 10px 10px; }  .icons-box i {     font-size: 44px;     display: inline-block;     -webkit-border-radius: 50em;     -moz-border-radius: 50em;     border-radius: 50em;     background: #fff;     padding: 45px 42px; </code></pre>  <p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;div style="background:#000;"&gt;         &lt;div class="icons-box"&gt;             &lt;!-- fa-icon-check is an icon that comes from glyphicons --&gt;             &lt;i class="fa-icon-check"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/1vox25o7/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/1vox25o7/</a></p>
