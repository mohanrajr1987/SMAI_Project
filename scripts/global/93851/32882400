<p>For some time now I use bootstrap when I have to integrate a design for a website. However the more I used it and the more I feel limited.</p>  <p>With bootstrap you can make two columns with a width of 50% each or even 40% / 60%.</p>  <p>My question is this : Is it possible, with bootstrap, to create two columns with a width of 45 and 55% ?</p>  <p>Even if my english is far for perfect I hope I was clear enough for you to understand my problem.</p>
