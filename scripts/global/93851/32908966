<p>I am pretty new in Twitter BootStrap and I have the following problem.</p>  <p>I am trying to implement this example into a JSP page: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_popover.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_popover.asp</a></p>  <p>So I have simply added this code into the JSP page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="#" data-toggle="popover" title="Popover Header" data-content="Some content inside the popover"&gt;Toggle popover&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And thene I have added this JQuery function into a JavaScript file imported into the previous JSP page:</p>  <pre><code>$('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover();   </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that it can't work and when I click on the button the popover window is not shown, in the URL I have <strong><a href="http://localhost:8080/WIFIPNSD/validazione#" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/WIFIPNSD/validazione#</a></strong> and the page is scrolled to the top.</p>  <p>Why? What am I missing? How can I fix this issue and show this popover window?</p>
