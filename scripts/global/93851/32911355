<p>What's the <code>tabindex</code> attribute in Bootstrap 3 for?</p>  <p>Its documentation doesn't say anything about them although they use them practically in all modals.</p>  <p>I've only find this regarding its use, which doesn't really say much</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Accessible tooltips for keyboard and assistive technology users</strong></p>      <p>For users navigating with a keyboard, and in particular users of assistive technologies, you should only add tooltips to keyboard-focusable elements such as links, form controls, or any arbitrary element with a tabindex="0" attribute.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And I found out <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/4854" rel="nofollow">I can't press <code>esc</code> to hide a modal if the <code>tabindex</code> attribute is not <code>-1</code></a>.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Lz5c1v8d/" rel="nofollow">Modal closing after pressing <code>esc</code> key (with tabindex)</a></li> <li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Lz5c1v8d/1/" rel="nofollow">Modal not closing after pressing <code>esc</code> key (without tabindex)</a></li> </ul>
