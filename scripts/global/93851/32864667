<p>I have issue with product comments in Prestashop 1.6.1.1 (default Bootstrap theme).</p>  <p>When I want to add review, and modal appears, the stars selecting is broken: <a href="http://oi60.tinypic.com/260eazs.jpg" rel="nofollow">here is link to picture</a> (<em>sorry for link, but I haven't reputation to post images, yet</em>)</p>  <p>I have no idea, why it is crashing.</p>  <p>I think it isn't possible to add code of that module in jsfiddle or others, so i add link to my test page of prestashop: <a href="http://firmaskiba.lh.pl/ps/" rel="nofollow">link to page</a> On the page is only one product, try to preview them and add opinion/review.</p>  <p>Have someone any idea?</p>  <p>P.S. Sorry for maybe poor English..</p>
