<p>So I'm using Coded UI [VS 2013 Premium] to test a very large software.</p>  <p>I'm in the process now of automation one module that is called by 69 different ways. I want to use data-driven testing but I have a problem with the results. The test results outcome does not have a very detailed test name "CodedUITest_1", "CodedUITest_2"...</p>  <p>Is there a way to programmatically rename my test in any way?</p>  <p>I'm currently trying on playing with TestContext but no luck.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help.</p>
