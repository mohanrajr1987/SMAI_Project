<p>I've switched to using the <a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com/" rel="nofollow">Dropzone.js</a> plugin for drag-and-drop file uploads. How can I write a Capybara test to ensure this functionality keeps on working?</p>  <p>Previously I had a template with an input file element:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="file" name="attachments"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And the test was simple:</p>  <pre><code>When(/^I upload "([^"]*)"$/) do |filename|   attach_file("attachments", File.expand_path(filename))   # add assertion here end </code></pre>  <p>However this no longer works because Dropzone doesn't have a visible file input.</p>
