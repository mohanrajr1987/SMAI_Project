<p>I have a black-box Robotium test working in Eclipse. I have imported the test into Android Studio. In the gradle file I've added:  - Dependency to Robotium library: <em>androidTestCompile 'com.jayway.android.robotium:robotium-solo:5.5.1'</em></p>  <ul> <li>The package of the app under test in the attribute: testApplicationId <em>"package.app.under.test"</em></li> </ul>  <p>When I run the test I get the Exception: </p>  <p>* <em>"Installation failed since the device already has a newer version of this application. In order to proceed, you have to uninstall the existing application."</em> *</p>  <p>I tried to uninstall the app, re-install, change the version of the app but I cannot run the test.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to run a black-box Robotium test in Android Studio, for an app without the source code available? Is correct to add the package of the app under test in the <em>testApplicationId</em> attribute.</p>
