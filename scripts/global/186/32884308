<p>I have a main project and a few subprojects. When I want to run tests, currently I have to do <code>sbt test</code> and <code>sbt subProjectName/test</code>. Is there any way of making sbt run all tests or for example all tests in the main project and one of the subprojects.</p>  <p>I am using Build.scala configurations, but can't find a way of setting this.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
