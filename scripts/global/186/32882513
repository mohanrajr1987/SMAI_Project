<p>I am new to TestComplete and I have started to work on Mobile Testing. I am trying to access the Icons present on the (Android)Mobile home screen using Object spy. Object spy is detecting the objects of a Java application but not the icons on mobile home screen.  </p>  <p>Is there any possible ways to detect them or not.? Please suggest me on this.</p>  <p>Best Regards, Guru Raja. </p>
