<p>I am generating HTML code using JavaScript on a web server and the HTML contains an   object that has an id "ImageID" and a src parameter pointing to "Picture1.jpg". </p>  <p>I want to refresh the web page every 5 seconds and use Javascript to generate a new file path using incrementing numbers to say "Picture2.jpg" or "Picture3.jpg" but I want to use the Javascript to check whether such a new file name exists on the server before trying to refresh the img object using</p>  <pre><code>document.getElementById("ImageID").src="Picture2.jpg";   </code></pre>  <p>How can server-side JavaScript be used to test the existence of a particular server-side file?</p>  <p>Is these a simple FileExists() method or does the object returned by document.getElementById(ImageName) have to be queried somehow to find out if it successfully found the file or not.</p>  <p>Thanks everyone.</p>
