<p>I want to open the navigation drawer with a click on the Hamburger menu <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/material-icons/external-assets/v1/icons/svg/ic_menu_black_24px.svg" alt="icon"> during a test. </p>  <p>Currently the Hierarchy of the action bar is as follows:</p>  <pre> ... Toolbar (@id/action_bar)   TextView (no-id)   ImageButton (no-id) &lt;-- this is the hamburger menu   ... ... </pre>  <p>using Espresso there is only Matchers for <code>withId</code>, <code>withText</code>, etc. which doesn't serves my purpose here.</p>
