<p>I'm trying to see if any one has the same problem ever since the "processed file exceeds 100Mb" Error appears next to my builds submitted to iTunes connect when I put it up for Testing using the test flight app. When people download it the images are not there just X's. It's like not all of my project is being uploaded. So is this something that will be fixed after my app gets approved the Apple Store. Or is this a problem just wondering? Thanks </p>
