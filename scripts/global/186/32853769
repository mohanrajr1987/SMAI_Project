<p>I've successfully connected to HP ALM, but do not know how to get the test-instance data. This is what the url looks like:</p>  <p><a href="https://hpalm.hostname.ca/qcbin/rest/domains/domain_name/projects/project_name/test-instances" rel="nofollow">https://hpalm.hostname.ca/qcbin/rest/domains/domain_name/projects/project_name/test-instances</a></p>  <p>Is there a way to append a query to the URL and get all the test-instances under this project?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
