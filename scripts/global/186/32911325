<p>I am writing some test in playspec and I want like to write a matcher like this</p>  <pre><code>planPromise.trialPeriodDays mustBe (equal (planRequest.trialPeriodDays) or be (None)) </code></pre>  <p>What the matcher is trying to do is to identify if the value is an int (previously defined) or none.</p>  <p>Obviosly is not working.</p>  <p>Is there a way to write this?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
