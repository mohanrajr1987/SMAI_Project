<p>I have been searching for a solution to do performance test on websockets. I found <a href="https://github.com/observing/thor" rel="nofollow">thor</a> at github. I was able to setup a simple echo server in my localhost to test <code>thor</code>. I was managed to get it working. But I have no idea analyzing the thor output. Below is an example output I managed to generate using thor,</p>  <pre><code>Online               16525 milliseconds Time taken           16525 milliseconds Connected            236 Disconnected         0 Failed               0 Total transferred    4.37MB Total received       4.37MB  Durations (ms):                       min     mean     stddev  median max     Handshaking          132     5685       4928    4307 16353   Latency              5       181          60     198 276      Percentile (ms):                        50%     66%     75%     80%     90%     95%     98%     98%    100%    Handshaking          4307    7358    9575    10770   13618   15008   15866   16099   16353   Latency              198     227     233     236     240     244     253     260     276    </code></pre>  <p>How can I analyse this result and set a benchmark for a Good server as well as low performing server? There isn't any documentation regarding the benchmarks in github. Can someone explain this in brief?</p>
