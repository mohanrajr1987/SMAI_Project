<p>I am testing a QT app on Redhat Linux and many of the controls have a graphic and not text. On windows I would use Spy++ to get the id/name of the control but not sure what to use on Linux and have not been able to find an answer on Google.</p>  <p>I would like to be able to say: On screen xyz button project.com.moduleName.buttonName - is missing caption, does not do x as expected. It should have caption blah and should do xyz.</p>  <p>What are my options for find the name of the button without going to the source?</p>
