<p>I am working on an small web-app that does the following:</p>  <ul> <li>showing a fullscreen map</li> <li>user sees a short form and enters name, email and uploads a photo</li> <li>the photo is set as a marker on the map</li> </ul>  <p>Now ... using HTML5 geolocation the user is asked by the browser at the first start if he allows the browser to check his location.</p>  <p>If he accepts everything is fine. If the user declines, his decision is saved and a geolocation by means of HTML5 cannot be retrieved unless the user manually revokes his refusal. That is not practical.</p>  <p>But I need the user's location to put the marker on the map.</p>  <p>I was thinking about: - using the location retrieved by HTML5 if the user accepted - if he refused use an IP based location check (which is not as accurate) in order to have this easy and seamless user experience</p>  <p>Or as an alternative have the user manually select his location by marking it on the map. But I would like to make it as easy as possible for the user with only a few clicks. And this workflow would not be very easy to handle on a small smartphone screen (for mobile version).</p>  <p>Any ideas on that? What would your workflow look like?</p>
