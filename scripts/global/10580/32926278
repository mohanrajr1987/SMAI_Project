<p>I have to implement a feature into my wpf application, I want to show my registered users on Google Map from Google Maps API. My all registered users will be visible when I will open my geo location it will show all registered users if they have already opened their geo location.</p>  <p>I want to implement this feature in wpf. I am beginner in maps, I don't want any code help from you at all, I want idea, how can I implement in my wpf/wp8.1 application?</p>  <p>I have not written code yet, because I don't know the path to implement it.</p>
