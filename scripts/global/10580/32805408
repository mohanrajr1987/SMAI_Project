<p>I have an interesting project. </p>  <p>So I have a WEB API that receives two parameters, longitude and latitude and that responds true or false being true that there is some resources in an circle with center (lat,long) and radio X (let say 10 miles). </p>  <p>If it responds true I have to call it again until it responds False.</p>  <p>If it responds false I don't have to call it again</p>  <p>When I get false I have to change (lat,long) so I search for those resources in other area different than the previous one until I cover all the territory of a country. I want to automatize it with python to cover for example all the USA territory. How can I do it?</p>  <p>I was thinking of starting from San Diego (bottom-left of USA) and going all the way up to Seattle or something like that. But, how can I know the delimiters (latitude and longitude) of the USA territory.</p>  <p>I don't know if I did explain correctly what I want to do. If not, please just tell me and I'll try better.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
