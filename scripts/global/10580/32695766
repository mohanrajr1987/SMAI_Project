<p>Can I check if a polygon is inside another polygon in mysql query? What will be the query to get all the polygons which contains the passed polygon in the where string?</p>  <p>After googling, I found a query:-</p>  <pre><code>SELECT *, AsText(poly) FROM geos   WHERE Contains(  GeomFromText('POLYGON((42.000497 -109.050149,   41.002380 -102.051881,   39.993237 -102.041959,   38.999037 -109.045220,   42.000497 -109.050149))'), poly ); </code></pre>  <p>I am not sure what it is doing basically? So what will the query to insert the polygon and checking if a passed polygon is inside it?</p>  <p>Thanks all in advance!</p>
