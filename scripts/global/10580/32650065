<p>I'm developing an phonegap app and using <code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition</code> method, I found that when I test this method in a phone without a SIM card, it always return a <code>Timeout expired</code> error. </p>  <p>But I found that another native app (like map app) can get geolocation, is there any way for phonegap app get geolocation without a SIM card?</p>
