<p>I have a simple problem. There is a location A who's postal code and city is known. There are 3 other locations B1, B2 and B3 who's latitude and longitude is known. I need to find the distance between Ab1, ab2, ab3 and arrange them in ascending order. Im using parse, android. </p>  <p>To determine lat, long from postal code I tried using <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro" rel="nofollow">this</a> by reading an answer here. However the documentation has left me confused. Im unable to find a tutorial showing how exactly to use the API. Could someone please guide me. It says I need an API key but through the browser, I can view custom links so why wont I be able to do the same via HTTP requests via my android app?</p>  <p>Once I have the coordinates of A, B1, B2 and B3, I know how to store them as ParseGeo point for separate objects and use query to sort by distance in ascending/ descending order as needed.</p>
