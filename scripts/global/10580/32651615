<p>Google Maps used to have a feature to create a link (short URL) to the current view and location. However that doesn't seem to be there anymore...?? Is that gone or how do I do that?</p>  <p>I mean not just a link to a specific search query, i.e. like <code>maps.google.com/maps?q=&lt;address&gt;</code> or <code>maps.google.com/maps?q=&lt;lat,lon&gt;</code>, but when moving around, having a certain view and zoom level and everything, you could do 'Create link'. With a checkbox 'create short URL` which resulted in URLs like <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/AbCdEf" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/maps/AbCdEf</a>.</p>  <p>Anyone knows where I can find that feature now?</p>
