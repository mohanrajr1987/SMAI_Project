<p><br>I'm trying to make a classifier for geolocation. Basically, I've collected a dataset with latitudes and longitudes in the USA. I want to classify with 4 classes including Northeast, Midwest, South and West in the USA. However, I don't know how to label my examples. For instance, if I have (X,Y) as (latitude,longitude), how can it match one of 4 classes? Can you give me a link for geolocation of regions in the USA?</p>
