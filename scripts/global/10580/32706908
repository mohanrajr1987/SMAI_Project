<p>I made an app using PhoneGap that needs to access the user's current latitude and longitude to function. Here's what I did:</p>  <pre><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(pos) {     // code using pos }); </code></pre>  <p>On the browser this asks your permission to access the info, but on the finished app it doesn't ask anything and just doesn't work. Is there anything I'm doing wrong/missing?</p>
