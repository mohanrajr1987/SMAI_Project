<p>I am working on an app which converts a public trash bin into a Smart Bin. The smart bin will use sensors for Fill-level, humidity, geo-location/GPS, temperature and tilt. </p>  <p>Is there a way to mock data sent by the sensors ? I would like to know what format such data is available.</p>  <p>How will the sensor send such information? Would this be a single sensor or multiple sensors for each use-case ?</p>
