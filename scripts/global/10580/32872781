<p>I've seen similar questions be made here about joining dataframes by timestamp relation where values do not match but I believe my problem can be a little bit more complex.</p>  <p>I have two data frames like this:</p>  <p>1)</p>  <pre><code>Zip     lat     long 03310   990655  1029875 03311   990660  1029887 03317   990685  1029880 </code></pre>  <p>and goes on for 140 something thousand rows</p>  <p>2)</p>  <pre><code>Key         lat     long 12001555   990657  1029870 12001523   990665  1029883 12001515   990680  1029882 </code></pre>  <p>And I would like to get this kind of join as result:</p>  <pre><code>Zip     lat     long      Key          03310   990655  1029875   12001555    03311   990660  1029887   12001523    03317   990685  1029880   12001515 </code></pre>  <p>Note that I want to join each zip code to its closest key.</p>  <p>There is a similar question in this post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31668163/geographic-distance-between-2-lists-of-lat-lon-coordinates">Geographic distance between 2 lists of lat/lon coordinates</a> but unfortunately the answer that applied in that case does not work for mine beacuse of data frame lengths which is 1) 144,512 obs 2) 304,680 it would take a couple hours at least!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
