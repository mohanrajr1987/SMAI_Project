<p>I am trying to save the user's location as a PFgeopoint to a custom parse class named: User. Nothing is saving and I can't find anything in the parse docs to figure out my error. Please help!</p>  <pre><code>  let user = PFObject(className:"User")           PFGeoPoint.geoPointForCurrentLocationInBackground {             (geoPoint: PFGeoPoint?, error: NSError?) -&gt; Void in             if error == nil {                 user.setObject(geoPoint!, forKey: "Location")             } else {                 user.setObject(geoPoint!, forKey: "Location")             }         } </code></pre>
