<p>I've had quite some issues with the Geolocation Cordova plugin (org.apache.cordova.geolocation). It works fine on iOS, but it doesn't at all on Android.</p>  <p>As I understand, the plugin used to include native Android code, but this was removed at some point, because it was too buggy/slow and the native web HTML5 implementation was much more stable and fast.</p>  <p>If I use the latest plugin version (0.3.2) which still has the native code, it does work (but slow and indeed, not always). But when it does return, the position object is always populated.</p>  <p>If I use the latest plugin version (1.0.1), the getCurrentPosition() immediately returns with an empty object ({}). It does not throw an error.</p>  <p>If I remove the plugin completely, and add the permissions manually to the Android project:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_LOCATION_EXTRA_COMMANDS" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The same thing happens. I just can't get it to work, but it doesn't make sense. No errors are displayed in the Android console. Any thoughts?</p>
