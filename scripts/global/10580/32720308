<p>I have a web app that has this code for getting the user's coordinates:</p>  <pre><code>if (navigator.geolocation) {    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {   </code></pre>  <p>But the moment I updated to iOS9 it ceased to work.  I'm not even getting the Safari prompt anymore asking permission to get my location.  Anyone else having this issue after updating to iOS9 and was able to resolve it?</p>
