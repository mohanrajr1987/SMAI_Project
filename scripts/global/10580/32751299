<p>I didn't change my code at all. It was working perfectly for days then all of a sudden the success callback function for navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition stopped running. </p>  <p>My code is:</p>  <pre><code>if(navigator.geolocation){    alert("you have geolocation");    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPostion(function(pos){      alert(pos.coords.longitude);    }); } </code></pre>  <p>The developer console gives me this error: </p>  <pre><code>Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://s.codepen.io" from accessing a frame with origin "http://codepen.io". Protocols, domains, and ports must match. </code></pre>  <p>I'm using codepen as my editor and I think the problem is on their end because this is the code I have been using for days and it's been working just fine.</p>
