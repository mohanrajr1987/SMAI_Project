<p>I have a meteor app that is using d'burles:google-maps' and 'mdg:geolocation'. I have a list of places in a collection that I am doing a geospacial query to find places close to me, I have to run this on the server since the mini-mongo does not support it yet.</p>  <p>I'm publishing and am able to send back and forth parameters to narrow my search of places, but since the geolocation takes a second to get the user's location, I can't just subscribe right away, otherwise location is null and the query won't know what to do.</p>  <p>I think my problem is in where I am subscribing, </p>  <pre><code>Meteor.subscribe('nearest', myLng, myLat, radius); </code></pre>  <p>here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>Template.map.onCreated(function() { //****If i subscribe here, i get back results (if i use fixed location, geolocation won't have given me results yet)     GoogleMaps.load();     var self = this;     Meteor.subscribe('nearest', myLng, myLat, );      GoogleMaps.ready('map', function(map) {     //****If i subscribe here, it collection count will be 0     //I need to subscribe HERE since this is when my geolocation will be provided       var marker;       console.log(Mycollection.find().count());       }); }); </code></pre>  <p>This is my publish, which is run in a server folder:</p>  <pre><code>Meteor.publish("nearest", function (lng, lat, dist) {     return Mycollection.find( {loc: { $geoWithin: { $centerSphere: [ [ lng, lat ], dist/3963.2 ] } }} ) }); </code></pre>  <p>Anyone know why the second location is not subscribing correctly, or know a way to get a subscription based on the user's location reactively?</p>  <p>I've been searching and searching with no luck, so any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
