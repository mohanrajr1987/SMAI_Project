<p>I'm currently using Mapbox but I've yet to find a way to draw polygon regions programmatically with coordinates that come as part of the Mapbox SDK. For instance if I want to outline the boundaries of Houston, TX as seen in the image below. Does Mapbox have a coordinate library that comes with the SDK? If so, how is it accessed?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ulvgg.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ulvgg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
