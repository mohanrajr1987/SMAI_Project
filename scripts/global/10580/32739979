<p>I am using <strong>Mapbox-iOS-SDK 2.1.2</strong> and I need to know when the user changes zoom level on the map view.  I know how to get the current zoom level, but I don't see any delegate methods for determining when the zoom level actually changed.  </p>  <p>My reason is I am trying to mimic the <em>scale dependencies</em> functionality found in ESRI, and I only want to display annotations for records in the local data store when the zoom level is <strong>15+</strong>.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if Mapbox supports notification when the zoom level has changed?  </p>  <p>Or, does Mapbox support scale dependencies?  If it does and I'm missing it, please let me know as that would save me from rolling my own version.</p>
