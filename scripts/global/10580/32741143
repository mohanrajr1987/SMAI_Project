<p>I have a problem with my app on iOS created using ionic.  In my home menu, when I press a button, my app tries to get my location and it shows me two alerts: one in Italian(that's right) and one in english:</p>  <p>ITA:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TRMHS.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TRMHS.jpg" alt="Italian alert"></a></p>  <p>ENGLISH:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zjJh1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zjJh1.jpg" alt="English alert"></a></p>  <p>The second alert is so ugly. I would like that the alert will be: "MYAPP vuole usare la tua posizione". How can I change the text of the second alert?</p>
