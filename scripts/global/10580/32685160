<p>Im trying to figure out how i would go about caching the result i get back from a nearby search. So i can get upto 60 places based upon my current long lat position. So im thinking that if user1 ask google for nearby places within a radius of 1km from position long: xxx lat: xxx. And i get a result back with places. And then user2 is asking for nearby places 500m away from user1. Then i would like to be able to use the cached data that user1 already fetched from google.</p>  <p>Any suggestion on how i would go about implement this kind of functionality? Or should i just cache each place by their long,lat and implement my own geosearch?</p>
