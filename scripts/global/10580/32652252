<p>I am working on integrating the <a href="https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Xamarin.Plugins/tree/master/Geolocator" rel="nofollow">geolocator plugin</a> into my Xamarin.Forms app. I have installed the nuget package into .core, .droid &amp; .ios. I haven't added it the the other projects in the solution, as I am on mac and they aren't supported. </p>  <p>I have added the example snippet (less the print to console lines), but it is throwing compiler errors. I have added <code>using Geolocator;</code> at the top, but the <code>var position</code> line throws error - <code>the 'await' operator can only be used when its containing method is marked with the 'async' modifier</code> - What have I done wrong? </p>  <p>I have included a screen shot below:</p>  <p>[![Compiler Errors][1]][1]</p>  <p>Any thoughts would be much appreciated.</p>  <h1>UPDATE</h1>  <p>My code now runs, I have the following structure:</p>  <pre><code>namespace MyApp {     public partial class HomePage : ContentPage     {      // Class Definitions       public HomePage(IAdapter adapter)     {         InitializeComponent();         this.adapter = adapter;          var LocManager = new CLLocationManager();         LocManager.AuthorizationChanged += (sender, args) =&gt; {             Debug.WriteLine ("Authorization changed to: {0}", args.Status);         };         if (UIDevice.CurrentDevice.CheckSystemVersion(8,0))             LocManager.RequestAlwaysAuthorization();          NewDeviceButton.Clicked += async (sender, e) =&gt; {            //Code which I would like to be able to use GetLatitude.        }     }      async Task&lt;double&gt; GetLongitude()     {         var locator = CrossGeolocator.Current;         locator.DesiredAccuracy = 50;          var position = await locator.GetPositionAsync(timeoutMilliseconds: 10000);         var longitude = position.Longitude;         return longitude;     } } </code></pre>  <p>However, I get the following error message.  <code>On iOS 8.0 and higher you must set either NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription in your Info.plist file to enable Authorization Requests for Location updates!</code> I originally only had the async method, but having seen the error message and reading your app note, I added the additional code at the top to try and authorise location services. However, I now get an error message saying <code>Error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'CLLocationManager' could not be found. Are you missing an assembly reference? (CS0246)</code> this shows on the var LocManager line. Why is this and what should I do to fix it? </p>
