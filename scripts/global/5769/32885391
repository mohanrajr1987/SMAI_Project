<p>I am writing a webservice client which runs from the command line and accesses a service which uses Oauth2.</p>  <p>I seem to be getting the Oauth token correctly, and the first request to the webservice recognizes the token. However the response is a 303 redirect (I have set <code>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION</code> => true) however the subsequent page says that I have supplied no authentication token.</p>  <p>Currently I am passing the oauth token by setting a header for the curl handle:</p>  <pre><code>"Authorization: OAuth2 $oauth" </code></pre>  <p>I suspect that the header is not being included in subsequent requests.</p>  <p>I tried setting  <code>CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH</code> => true, to no avail (but according to the manual, that persists a username and password across redirects - not the authentication header).</p>  <p>The webservice allows for oauth tokens to be sent in an authentication header or in the URL (but not as a cookie). Setting the token in the URL returns the same redirect (i.e. without the token in the URL) hence I can't use this method with <code>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION</code>.</p>  <p>(the service does not allow for oauth tokens sent in cookies, PHP version is 5.6)</p>
