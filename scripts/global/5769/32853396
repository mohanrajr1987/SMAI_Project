<p>I am using ezPublish version 4.3 and trying to integrate Facebook login for all users in the system. I followed the instructions at <a href="http://blog.nxcgroup.com/2012/ez-publish-social-networks-integration-signin/#.Vgr2HZfdbHs" rel="nofollow">Facebook Login for ezPublish</a></p>  <p>However, it requires me to configure two values in Facebook app of mine i.e. <em>Deauthorize Callback URL</em> and <em>Valid OAuth redirect URIs</em>. I am not sure what is the <em>OAuth URI</em> format used in ezPublish for login/ failed login. Please suggest the solution.</p>
