<p>I have to write the server side of an Android application. I don't know much (actually, anything) about Android development. If an application has the "login via Facebook" icon, what happens <em>exactly</em> on the server?</p>  <p>I assume the app, after authentication, would contact the app server and tell it "I am Facebook user ID XXXXXX"; but what's stopping the app from saying so? Won't the server need to hear that the application is authenticated <em>directly</em>?</p>  <p>The "normal" way, with a Facebook login button on a web form, it's more "natural" as the app redirects to Facebook, and then Facebook redirects back to the application once login is successful (or not). But... what happens with a stand alone application, effectively?</p>  <p>Please note that I am after the <em>server</em> side of things.</p>
