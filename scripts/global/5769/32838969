<p>I'm writing an AngularJS app that talks to a php api. Is there a way to prevent users to make api calls directly, without going through the Angular app that sits on one particular domain. So they have to visit my domain, where the angularjs sits, and only make calls to the api through the Angular app. I know because it's client side that all code is inspectable. My app has a public part, and a part that's only available after user login. So I could easily secure the calls after user login, through OAuth or JWT, but I want to secure the entire thing, including the public part that doesn't need user login.</p>  <p>Is this actually possible?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
