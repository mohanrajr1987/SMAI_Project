<p>The client is able to authenticate using hello.js to facebook and send the access token back to the server which then does a <code>get graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=xx</code> and if it is correct returns the user's profile info.</p>  <p>I want to do the same for Twitter but even after reading the documentation I don't understand which endpoint I should hit.Is it possible to do it with a REST call? </p>
