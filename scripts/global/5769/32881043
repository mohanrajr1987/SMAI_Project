<p>I am learning flask by building my own app, based on <a href="https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask" rel="nofollow">cookiecutter-flask template</a> and I wont to add LinkidIn auth there. Right now I am using <a href="https://github.com/lingthio/Flask-User" rel="nofollow">Flask-User</a> as login manager. </p>  <p>The problem is that I can't init this flask-oauth object as extension like here - <a href="https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.app_name%7D%7D/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.app_name%7D%7D/app.py#L39" rel="nofollow">github</a>, because in my case it says, that oauth doesn't have init_app method</p>  <pre><code>from flask_oauthlib.client import OAuth oauth = OAuth() oauth.init_app(app) </code></pre>  <p>and I also can't understand, where should I put <a href="https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib/blob/master/example/linkedin.py#L10" rel="nofollow">linkedin config</a> object? Is it possible to use this extension with flask app factiry structure? or should I switch to the <a href="https://github.com/joelverhagen/flask-rauth" rel="nofollow">Flask-Rauth</a>? (but it will introduce additional problems)</p>
