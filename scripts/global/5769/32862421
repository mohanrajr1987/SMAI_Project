<p>Facebook login is redirecting back to <code>https</code> URL when it should be going back to <code>http</code></p>  <p>Correct URL: <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/social/complete/facebook/?redirect_state=</code></p>  <p>After Facebook login, the URL being redirected to is <code>https://127.0.0.1:8000/social/complete/facebook/?redirect_state=</code></p>  <p>developers.facebook.com app 'Valid OAuth redirect URIs' is set to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000</code></p>  <p>I've also set <code>SOCIAL_AUTH_REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS = False</code> in settings.py but this hasn't solved the issue.</p>
