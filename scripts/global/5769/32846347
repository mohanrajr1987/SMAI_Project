<p>I am using opensource <code>OrangeHRM</code> and after logging in through admin,</p>  <p>I went to:  </p>  <pre><code>1.  Admin -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Social Media Authentication   2.  Select Google+ from dropdown. 3. Add Client id, secret, redirect url and saved.   </code></pre>  <p>In login page, if logging in through Google option, it provides an option to select gmail account and once I select account and allowing my gmail account to access OrangeHRM, It takes me back to login page instead of dashboard.  </p>  <p>Is there any way I can fix it? As per one of documents of OrangeHRM, i.e. <a href="http://www.orangehrm.com/Files/OS_userGuide/OS_3.3_Administrative_User_Guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">User Guide</a>, it says:  </p>  <pre><code> Google Plus -   This section allows configuring the Google + providers.      This section should be enabled from the back end.     </code></pre>  <p>I am not sure If I need to enable anything from backend and If so, what and where should I enable?</p>
