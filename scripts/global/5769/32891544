<p><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong></p>  <p>I want my oauth client to re fetch the Authorities from the oauth authorisation server for every request, so any changes to the users Authorities are reflected straight away.</p>  <p><strong><em>Details:</em></strong></p>  <p>I have a Spring Boot web app that is secured with <strong>@EnableOauth2Sso</strong>.</p>  <p>I have written my own oauth authorisation app, that is secured using <strong>@EnableAuthorizationServer</strong>.</p>  <p>My web app is set to use the authorisation code grant type.  This all works fine, and I can log in to my web app against the authorisation app, with whole oauth2 dance occurring correctly resulting in the authorisation code being swapped for an access token.</p>  <p>Once we have the access token back in the web app, as part of the initial authentication, spring security on the web app is then calling the /oath/check_token end point on the authorisation server and storing the returned user info in the HTTP session.</p>  <p>How can I stop this, and make it re request the user info from the authorisation server for every request to the web app?</p>
