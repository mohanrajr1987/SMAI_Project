<p>I am trying to run the sample Google Apps Script Service Account OAuth example taken from here: <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/apps-script-oauth2/blob/master/samples/GoogleServiceAccount.gs" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/googlesamples/apps-script-oauth2/blob/master/samples/GoogleServiceAccount.gs</a> and keep getting a server timed-out error.  I copied the exact code and just substituted in the private key, client email, and a user email.  The example code looks to be current as there was an update to it on July 30th.</p>  <p>I have authorized <code>https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/files</code> through the admin console as well as <code>https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token</code> and have listed these as scopes in the admin settings (and domain-wide delegation is enabled).  I am using an admin account to run the script.  </p>  <p>I keep getting the ubiquitious "Server Timed Out" error and nothing shows up in the Execution Logs.</p>  <p>What might be the problem?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</p>
