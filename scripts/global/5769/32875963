<p>I'm creating an application on Facebook that will only ever have one user: me. I'm not making a GUI for the application, which means that there's no client side auth.</p>  <p>Is there a way that I can use my username and password or some other app information to get an access token for myself?</p>  <p>I'm familiar with the refresh token flows and everything for OAuth applications for other people, but I've never done this without some sort of Facebook login button, especially on a one person application. I'm happy to hard code in my user information.</p>  <p>I've tried using this:</p>  <pre><code>access_token_url = 'https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?type=client_cred&amp;client_id=' + config['app_id'] + '&amp;client_secret=' + config['app_secret'] token_response = urllib.urlopen(access_token_url).read() access_token = token_response.replace('access_token=', '') session = FacebookSession(     config['app_id'],     config['app_secret'],     access_token, ) </code></pre>  <p>But that doesn't give me an access token specific to my own account, only one for the application itself.</p>
