<p>Im trying to access the Instagram app from my own iOS for OAuth registration. I have the following code and it is working to access Instagram via Safari, but I would like the app to open if it is on the phone. Also looking for a way to get an authentication token from Instagram for my app.</p>  <p>Here is my code: </p>  <pre><code>func startOAuth2Login() { ....     let authPath:String = "https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=\(clientID)&amp;redirect_uri=grokInstagram://?aParam=paramVal&amp;response_type=code"      var instagramHooks = "instagram://app"     var instagramUrl = NSURL(string: instagramHooks)      if UIApplication.sharedApplication().canOpenURL(instagramUrl!)     {         UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL(instagramUrl!)       } else {         //redirect to safari because the user doesn't have Instagram         print("didn't have it")         UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL(NSURL(string: authPath)!)     } .... </code></pre>
