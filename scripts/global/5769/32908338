<p>Currently I'm working on my master thesis and I am trying to send a REST via QNetworkRequest and OAuth 2.0 to query a list of my google fusion tables. </p>  <p>But I can't get it working. I already created the client-id at the google console but i have no idea, how to setup the QNetworkRequest object to correctly initalize the connection/authorization. Everytime I get a authorization error message. </p>  <p>My main goal is to create a Qt application, which is running on a server. This application should post frequently generated data via QNetworkRequest to one or more google fusion tables (like sending measured data to the cloud). Is this generally possible? </p>  <p>My current code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>m_network = new QNetworkAccessManager(this); QNetworkRequest request; request.setRawHeader("Authorization", "client_id:......."); request.setUrl(QUrl("https://www.googleapis.com/fusiontables/v1/tables")); QNetworkReply *reply = m_network-&gt;get(request);  QObject::connect(reply, SIGNAL(downloadProgress(qint64,qint64)),                         SLOT(slotSetProgress(qint64,qint64))); QObject::connect(m_network, SIGNAL(finished(QNetworkReply *)),                             SLOT(slotRequestFinished(QNetworkReply *))); </code></pre>  <p>I hope someone can help me getting started with this topic. Thanks!</p>
