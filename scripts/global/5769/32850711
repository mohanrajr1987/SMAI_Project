<p>I have added a new Integrated APi with twitter to my OAuth.io, however I am unable to edit anything outside of the client_id and client_secret key. In the beginning I was asked to add permitted URLs for this APi but now I cannot change them anywhere as it does not give me an option. Where can I find this on the Dashboard?</p>
