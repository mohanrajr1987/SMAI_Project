<p>I am implementing an OAuth server using Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth.</p>  <p>I use the OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions to setup AuthorizeEndpointPath and TokenEndpointPath.  It looks like there is no option for a UserInfoEndpointPath though.  </p>  <p>The OAuthV2 spec does discuss this endpoint vaguely - </p>  <p><em><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hunt-oauth-v2-user-a4c-05#section-1" rel="nofollow">This specification does not define a resource owner profile    information API.  It is assumed that other APIs such as the SCIM API    [I-D.ietf-scim-api] or the OpenID Connect [OpenID.Core] UserInfo    Endpoint could be used for this purpose.</a></em></p>  <p>So, is there no way to leverage OAuthAuthorizationServerProvider to provide this endpoint? Would I have to make a separate MVC controller endpoint? Or is there a better way?</p>
