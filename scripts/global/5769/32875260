<p>I already have a django app running on App Engine, but the current user authentication is provided by Djoser, which uses a simple token authentication.</p>  <p>Now I want to write some new APIs to third party applications to allow them to access user data. So I need to implement the OAuth2.0 authentication.</p>  <p>I found some libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/evonove/django-oauth-toolkit" rel="nofollow">django-oauth-toolkit</a>. But the tutorial assumes that you build your app and database from scratch. So I wonder if there's a way to use my current user database to do OAuth2.0 authentication, instead of asking the user to signup again with the same username. Thanks.</p>
