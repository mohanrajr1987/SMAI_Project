<p>I am currently creating a site that uses Quizlet to make sets (<a href="https://quizlet.com/api/2.0/docs" rel="nofollow">https://quizlet.com/api/2.0/docs</a>). It uses Django for the backend and JS for the front end. I need to use OAuth2.0 to login the user into Quizlet in order to upload the set. After many hours of research I have not found a good way to do this. JS is too insecure and there are no Django client side libraries. PHP is not an option.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
