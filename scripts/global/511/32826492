<p>I have a Java server and PostgreSQL database.</p>  <p>There is a background process that queries (inserts some rows) the database 2..3 times per second. And there is a servlet that queries the database once per request (also inserts a row).</p>  <p>I am wondering should I have separate <code>Connection</code> instances for them or share a single <code>Connection</code> instance between them? Also does this even matter? Or is PostgreSQL JDBC driver internally just sending all requests to a unified pool anyway? </p>  <p>One more thing should I make a new <code>Connection</code> instance for every servlet request thread? Or share a <code>Connection</code> instance for every servlet thread and keep it open the entire up time?</p>  <p>By separate I mean every threads create their own <code>Connection</code> instances like this:</p>  <pre><code>Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, pw); </code></pre>
