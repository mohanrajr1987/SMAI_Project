<p>So a <a href="https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/containers_overview/concurrent_vector.htm" rel="nofollow">tbb vector</a> allows to get begin pointer and length (size). So can we safely assume that we can iterate from begin to begin+length without putting the lock? Or how can we pass pointer contents to C style function that accepts begin pointer and length? Shall wee provide lock only on removing elements from vector and concurrent growth is acceptable?</p>  <p>Real life problem: concurrent vector of pointers to zmqsockets that is getting bigger and smaller concurrently. A thread with zmq poll that provides C style iteration.</p>
