<p>I spent last year studying the actor model, but in the last month I was curious about the Go language, so read about it also.</p>  <p>Both the concurrency model helps to scale an application, but with my previous experience I can't find a case where the goroutines are better than the actor model.</p>  <p>When I read about goroutine I think that everything is done with a goroutine can be done also with actors, but the opposite isn't true (or at least you can't do it easily), so this let me think that I didn't get the goroutine right. I always developed web application, and I think this block me to think about some problems for which the goroutine can do better than the actor model.</p>  <p>I would like to know for which use case using a goroutine is better than an actor.</p>
