<p>I am looking for software design review tool that can make suggestions based on principles of software design patterns i.e Re-usability, Use of Abstraction, Un-necessary looping &amp; conditional logics.</p>  <p>I tried SonarQube but I feel I need much more than just static code analysis that looks at entire project as a whole and finds opportunities that a human developer vision can never spot.</p>
