<p>I'd like to know if the use of <code>ApplicationException</code> is recommended to return application errors when a user breaks some business rule. For example:</p>  <pre><code>public void validate(string name, string email) {        int count1 = (from p in context.clients         where (p.name == clients.name)         select p).Count();      if (count1 &gt; 0)         throw new ApplicationException("Your name already exist in the database");      int count2 = (from p in context.clients         where (p.email == clients.email)         select p).Count();      if (count2 &gt; 0)         throw new ApplicationException("Your e-mail already exist in the database");  } </code></pre>  <p>Is it a good or bad strategy? If isn't, what would be a better approach?</p>
