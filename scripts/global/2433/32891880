<p>I'm building both a client and server side application. it is a messaging/communication program. Currently the client side application is designed to accept either markup and/or text files that represent the requested information, as well as accept a streamed/downloaded file which represents message content (images, videos, etc), and also performs these processes in reverse in the case of sending messages, requesting lists, etc.</p>  <p>The server side of the application consists of python scripts and modules that read, write, and store files and information based on the requested action. The server itself would have to communicate with external dependencies outside of the python libraries (postgresql). </p>  <p>How could I deploy this program in a way that allows it to communicate via the requests and responses of HTTP and be serviceable by the client application programs?</p>
