<p>I have a child controller class that extends a base controller class. In the child I have defined a static namespace string that points to the model class I want to use when calling functions in the base class. Right now, I have to use <code>call_user_func</code> to call the function on the correct model class. The code looks something like this:</p>  <h2>Child Class</h2>  <pre><code>class RolesController extends Controller {     const RESOURCE_NAME = 'roles';     const MODEL = 'Role'; } </code></pre>  <h2>Parent Class</h2>  <pre><code>class Controller extends BaseController {      private $model;      public function __construct()     {         $this-&gt;model = 'App\\Models\\' . static::MODEL;     }      public function getAll(Request $request)     {         $objects = call_user_func([$this-&gt;model, 'getAll'], [             Model::GET_OPTION_FORMAT =&gt; true         ]);          return Response::success([             static::RESOURCE_NAME =&gt; $objects         ]);     } } </code></pre>  <p>I can't help but think that this design pattern is incorrect. Is there a better way to accomplish what I am trying to do without having to rely on <code>call_user_func</code>? I can not find a similar question as I am struggling to find the words to describe this problem. If anyone could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated. </p>
