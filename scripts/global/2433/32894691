<p>I was reading an article that was linked from the CodeProjects blog that lambasted the overuse of design patterns by newer programmers when writing code. I will try to find a link and add it later, but I read it a bit ago and the question has just been bothering me. The argument from the article was something along the lines of:</p>  <p>"Green programmers tend to use a lot of design patterns instead of following KISS principles and just coding for the problem at hand"</p>  <p>I have also read that some believe that using design patterns restricts the creativity of the programmer, which also is a little but of a strange argument.</p>  <p>My question to the wonderful programmers of stack overflow who are more experienced than I is: does this ring true? Do you find that newer programmers who utilize design patterns often overuse them and force them into places where they shouldn't be used? If so, what is your advice (besides "code more") to better understand where and when to use patterns in programming?</p>
