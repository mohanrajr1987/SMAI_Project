<p>I have a given web service. (This is only an example, the real one is more complex, but it has the same problem.) The service has three methods and all three methods have a person as parameter and need other things from it. (I can't change the entity or methods.)</p>  <p>Entity (Person) (It has only a default constructor):</p>  <pre><code>private String name; private int age; private Address address; private List&lt;String&gt; hobbies; private List&lt;Person&gt; friends; </code></pre>  <ul> <li>Method1 needs name and age.</li> <li>Method2 needs address name and age.</li> <li>Method3 needs all.</li> </ul>  <p>I need to fill the object from my own objects. I need to write a "converter". What is the best practice for it?</p>  <p>My solutions:</p>  <ul> <li>Builder Pattern with builds for three methods.</li> <li>Set all attributes and send unhandled overhead (bad solution in my eyes).</li> </ul>
