<p>I have a </p>  <pre><code>LoadingCache&lt;Long, String&gt; idNameMap </code></pre>  <p>that needs to be populated. The ids are unique in the context of my application. However, due to the way data is stored in the table, I need to pass in extra parameters to database query to complete a fast database lookup. Which means that I should be able to pass these parameters to my loadAll method which currently looks like:</p>  <pre><code>@Override public Map&lt;Long, String&gt; loadAll(Iterable idsIterable) throws Exception {     //pass in ids and extra parameters to improve database query speed } </code></pre>  <p>Those extra parameters do not need to be part of my cache. My question is that what pattern should I use to solve this problem?</p>
