<p>I'm trying to implement <code>lazy</code> in C++ like in this Python example using decorators:</p>  <pre><code>@lazy @factory(Category) def func(self):     return self.__raw_data  # for building object include object type and **params </code></pre>  <p>I found <a href="http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/04/21/getting-lazy-with-c/" rel="nofollow">Getting Lazy with C++</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/414243/lazy-evaluation-in-c">Lazy evaluation in C++</a> post but they haven't helped me. I don't understand how implement the lazy.</p>
