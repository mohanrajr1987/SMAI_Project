<p>Hi I should use strategy pattern to write code of this game. I create Country class and Character Interface. But i'm little confused i don't know where should i add abilities?</p>  <p>player first has to select a country for his country, which could   be: Latveria, Ecotopia,Dinotopia. After  selecting the country, player has to assign a class for his/her character by selecting one of the following: King,Queen,Troll and Knight. Depending on its class a character   can have    different abilities: a  Knight  can handle any<br> kind of weapon  easily, which includesBow and Arrow, Swords, Knifes and Axes. King doesn't use any weapon, he can make strategy. Queen uses speacial Magic. Troll uses Knifes and Axes.  All types of characters can fight using its specific abilities. Besides, all can ride horse and swim.</p>
