<p>I am searching for solutions how to design a "large" javascript application.</p>  <p>I tried to draw the cross relations, which I will need: <a href="http://fs5.directupload.net/images/150930/qmvt7xu9.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fs5.directupload.net/images/150930/qmvt7xu9.jpg</a></p>  <p>I have a fix template of the App and dynamic content, like site1.  The App is connected via Websocket to a server and I have a lot of cross realtions of vars as you can see in the drawing.</p>  <p>My question is now: How to design and split up the party in a nice way. How can I react on events in the application, so for example change the JS value of vars inside the "site1 widget" and the other way.. how to send for example x/y via the websocket to the server..</p>  <p>Thank you very much :)</p>
