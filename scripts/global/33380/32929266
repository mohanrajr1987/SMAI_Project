<p>I was watching youtube and i realized there was an ad for an app with install button under the video.</p>  <p>I pressed the button and it popped up play store purchase, similar to in-app purchase of items! Except it wasn't an item but a full app purchase!</p>  <p>I googled this and couldn't find anything, all the clues point to the normal in app purchase rather than the inapp "app" purchase. </p>  <p>My question is, how pop up play store without leaving the app for purchashing another app?</p>  <p>Thanks </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ihzfe.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ihzfe.jpg" alt="step 1"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ziBcw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ziBcw.png" alt="step 2"></a></p>
