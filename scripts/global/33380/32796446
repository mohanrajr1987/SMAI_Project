<p>I sometimes have problems with my IAP after users update my app from the app store. My receipt verification fails and I didn't log the reason until now. Is there no receipt or is it invalid... I don't know yet... So I'd like to refresh the receipt if my validation fails. But the "problem" is that a dialog will pop up asking the user for it's iTunes Credentials.</p>  <p>So basically I'd like to avoid that dialog and only show it to users where the receipt is really broken and needs to be updated. Not to users who just didn't buy my IAP. For those users this dialog would be really confusing I guess....</p>  <p>So my question now is: <strong>When should a valid receipt be present?</strong> Do app-updates break receipts?</p>  <p>From the documentation I found the following:</p>  <p><code>appStoreReceiptURL: For an application purchased from the App Store, use this application bundle property to locate the receipt. This property makes no guarantee about whether there is a file at the URLâ€”only that if a receipt is present, that is its location.</code></p>  <p>But it doesn't tell me when it should be present?!?</p>  <p>What should be the best practice there?</p>  <p>Thanks, Georg</p>
