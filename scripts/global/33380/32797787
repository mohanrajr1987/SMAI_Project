<p>Today I checked iTunes Connect and my app had had a sale yesterday. My app only has one In App Purchase for the value of U$29,99 but the weird thing is that iTunes Connect shows me that the sale was for U$34,58 and the sale is not registered in my server. Does some one experiment something similar?  </p>
