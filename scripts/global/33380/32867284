<p>On trying to perform a purchase on my app, i keep getting the popup which says "Your Purchase could not be completed. For assistance contact iTunes Support at ..... ". </p>  <p>I had used the same account few minutes back to perform iap and at that time it got processed successfully. I never used to face this issue before upgrading to ios9. Is there some issue with my account or some issue with new upgrade of ios9. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fEifn.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fEifn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
