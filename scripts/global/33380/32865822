<p>I am using this code to bring user to the view controller where IAP are presented. There is a delay between request.start() and bringing the IAP view controller onto the screen. I want to give the user the ability to cancel this process. How do I do that? Which methods do I need to implement? any help much appreciated</p>  <pre><code>func getProductInfo(){         if SKPaymentQueue.canMakePayments() {             let request = SKProductsRequest(productIdentifiers: Set([id1,id2]))             request.delegate = self             request.start()         }else{             print("make IAP available in Settings")         }     }      func productsRequest(request: SKProductsRequest, didReceiveResponse response: SKProductsResponse) {          let products = response.products         if products.count != 0{             for product in products{                 switch product.productIdentifier{                 case "id1":                     product1 = product                     break                 case "id2":                     product2 = product                     break                 default:                     break                 }             }             print("mam produkt")             goToViewControllerWithIAP()           }else{             print("product not found")         }      } </code></pre>
