<p>In my app i have several managed products which have a certain price. In the release week I want to make some of them free of charge. As the minimum price on Google Play Developer console is 0.5â‚¬, I'm not sure how to make those products free of charge and at the same time save its SKUs to the Google Play servers (as it happens on default purchase flow). I want that, because a user may delete the app and reinstall it later. </p>  <p>Is that even possible?</p>
