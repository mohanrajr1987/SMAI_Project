<h1>Transaction Suddenly /Unexpectedly/ Removed from SKPaymentQueue - any ideas why?</h1>  <h2>Intro</h2>  <p>We experience a strange behaviour of SKPaymentQueue under iOS-9 and iOS-9.0.1. We suspect that this is an iOS issue.  This example is a minimal app-frame that demonstrates the SKPaymentQueue related issue. Download the example <a href="https://github.com/IgorTavcar/TransactionSuddenlyRemoved" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <h2>Facts</h2>  <ul> <li>Issue appears in sandbox environment (iOS 9.0.1).</li> <li>Issue appears in TestFlight environment (iOS 9.0.1).</li> <li>Never tested in production environemt.</li> <li>Never tested on iOS 9.1 /beta/.</li> <li>Issue never appears on iOS 8.4.1.</li> </ul>  <h2>App</h2>  <p>This app requires one non-consumable IAP product with content hosted on Apple.  App has only one button that starts the transaction/download process. </p>  <h2>Issue</h2>  <p>Download process is unexpectedly terminated when app is moved from the foreground to the background and then back to the foreground.</p>  <p>To reproduce the issue ...</p>  <ol> <li><p>Adapt this project to your dev. environment (set NON_CONSUMABLE_PRODUCT_WITH_HOSTED_CONTENT to your IAP product-id).</p>  <ul> <li><p>Create a test app (iTunes Connect).</p></li> <li><p>Host a non-consumable IAP product (Application Loader).</p></li> </ul></li> <li><p>Press the button "Get Product".</p></li> <li><p>Wait until downloading starts.</p></li> <li><p>Press Home button to resign the app.</p></li> <li><p>(Re)Activate the app (touch the app icon).</p></li> <li><p>SKPaymentQueue will eventually send one or two download update events.</p></li> <li><p>!! SKPaymentQueue will send the paymentQueue(queue: SKPaymentQueue, removedTransactions transactions: [SKPaymentTransaction])` message to the observer.</p></li> <li><p>!! Downloading is now terminated (no events).</p></li> </ol>  <h2>Known Workarounds</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Keep the app in the foreground while downloading.</p></li> <li><p>Don't activate the app until the downloading is completed (at the system level), then activate the app.</p></li> </ul>
