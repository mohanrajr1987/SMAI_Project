<p>I am working on an tvOS app which is linked (with the same App ID) to an iOS app where in app purchase is fully functional, and I am using the same implementation as for the iOS app.</p>  <p>I am using a development apple TV, not just the simulator.</p>  <p>My sandbox tester account is not recognized by the Apple TV and my productsRequest doesn't get any answer.</p>  <p>Is there something specific to do with StoreKit on tvOS ? Thanks</p>
