<p>So let's say I have an app (with in-app products) that is published on google play and uses github as a source control (the repository is public)</p>  <p>Can it be dangerous to share:</p>  <ol> <li>Admob dev id or app id</li> <li>In-app billing products id, etc. related to IAP</li> <li>License key for In-app billing</li> <li>Key for generating signed apk (without password obviosly)</li> <li>...Something else?</li> </ol>  <p>Obviosly, it will be easy to "pirate" all the In-app products by modifying the source code.</p>  <p>Can something worse then pirating be done? And if so, is there a good way to prevent this without removing files from source control?</p>
