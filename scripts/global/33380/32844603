<p>In my app , there is functionality called in app subscription which is auto renewal . In app there is a feature called "Cancel Upgrade".</p>  <p>What I want is If user cancel the <strong>subscription</strong> then his/her subcription will be cancelled not refundable but just cancelled.</p>  <p>I go through this <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_admin.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> and found below note:</p>  <p><strong>You cannot use the API to issue refunds or cancel In-app Billing transactions. You must do this manually through your Google payments merchant account. However, you can use the API to retrieve order information.</strong></p>  <p>But i want my user to cancel his/her upgrade.</p>  <p>Is there any way to do this or please provide alternate solution for this.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
