<p>I want to offer a renewable subscription in my iOS application. The user subscribed and the receipt is stored. Now i wonder how i need to make sure that the receipt is valid and not cancelled:</p>  <ol> <li><p>If the user cancels the subscription and it is not renewed, how would i know it? If the subscription is renewed, when a new receipt will be created?</p></li> <li><p>If the user cancels the subscription through apple support (because, for example, he bought it my mistake), how can i know it? The receipt on the device will be valid. Should i refresh the receipt every time the user logs in?</p></li> </ol>  <hr>  <p>EDIT: I forgot to mention it, but the receipt is checked in the client side.</p>
