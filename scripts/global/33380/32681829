<p>I have published a unity app to the store and in app purchases are working perfectly in Windows 10.</p>  <p>However on Win/Phone 8.1, I get an error saying: Win 8.1 - "Unable to complete purchase. Please try again later" Win Phone 8.1 - "Can't find item in catalogue. We've looked, but can't find the item you wanted to buy"</p>  <p>Based on these errors, I assumed that my Product id did not match, however I can buy the exact same product in Windows 10, without issue - this to mean shows that the products being sent to the store for purchase are correct.</p>  <p>Has anyone encountered this before or knows what might be going on?</p>  <p>Is there something different that needs to be done in on dev.windows.com in order to make IAP work for Win/Phone 8.1 devices?</p>
