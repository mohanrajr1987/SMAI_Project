<p>On iOS8, in my app (which is working fine), if the user is not logged in with their Apple Id, and they attempt an in-app purchase, they get the following Apple alert:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eLtAZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eLtAZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now, if the user presses "Cancel",in the code, we get an error <strong>code 2</strong> with the <strong>SKPaymentTransaction</strong>. This has the enum code <strong>SKErrorPaymentCancelled</strong></p>  <p>On iOS9, in the same situation, we now get error code 0, </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error Domain=SKErrorDomain Code=0 "Cannot connect to iTunes Store"   UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Cannot connect to iTunes Store}</p> </blockquote>  <p>This has enum code SKErrorUnknown, which doesn't seem useful. </p>  <p>Anyone else run into this? The difficult here is in my app UI. If I get an error code, SKErrorPaymentCancelled, I don't present any info to the user as it is clear that the user has explicitly done a cancellation. </p>  <p>With <strong>SKErrorUnknown</strong>, I can't tell what has gone on, so I present an error alert to the user. Which, if they have explicitly cancelled, is just annoying. Thoughts?</p>
