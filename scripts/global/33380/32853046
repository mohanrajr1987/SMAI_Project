<p>Under certain circumstances (such as poor network), I will initiate a restore procedure calling <code>[[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] restoreCompletedTransactions];</code>.</p>  <p>The StoreKit credentials dialog <em>does not</em> appear, and <code>- (void)paymentQueue: updatedTransactions:</code> is never invoked. Finally <code>- (void)paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished:</code> is called.</p>  <p>I would have expected the failure callback to be invoked in this case. I know that the currently logged in user has in fact purchased items before (one of my test accounts).</p>  <p>Any one else experiencing this behavior? I'm seeing it on iOS 8 and 9, on hardware. What work arounds would there be?</p>  <p>Ideally I'd like to tell the user that the Restore process failed. On other threads people recommend that if <strong>no items</strong> are returned to tell the user that no previous purchases were found, but I think this is a poor UX, as people might panic if they know they've purchased things previously resulting in support calls.</p>
