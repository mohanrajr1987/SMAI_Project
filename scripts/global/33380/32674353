<p>I have an app that I would like companies to buy licences for.  Say they have 5 devices so would by 5 subscriptions?</p>  <p>is this possible with IAP?</p>  <p>Is there a way of stopping them just having a single shared iCloud account and buying a single licence which is re-used across devices?</p>  <p>Has anyone need to do this before?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
