<p>I'm new on android programming, and this is the first time I publish an app, thing is, I did two diferent apps, they are practically the same, except one of the activities has one more feature in one of them.</p>  <p>Now I dont want two apps, but a free app where you can buy that one more feature. But that feaute changes almost all the activity.</p>  <p>How do I change that activity after the purchase? thanks in advance</p>
