<p>I am using APIs <a href="https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/purchases/products" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/purchases/products</a> (Purchases.products) to verify in app purchases. My problem is i can't find documentation on error handling. How can i tell if it is invalid payment from rooted device that uses Lucky Patcher probably meaning purchase with wrong token? The only response i am able to get is - 400 invalid value which i believe, can mean anything.</p>
