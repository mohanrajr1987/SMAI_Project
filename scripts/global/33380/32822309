<p>Actually there are two categories when you add a plan in developer console:</p>  <p>1)  Managed Products 2)  Subscription</p>  <p>So when we use Subscription Plan(added in Subscription category) for payment &amp; subscribing the user then we donâ€™t get any <strong>orderID</strong> in acknowledgement after successful payment.</p>  <p>Response is like :</p>  <pre><code>{"packageName":"package name","productId":"subscription_plan_id","purchaseTime":1443003294668,"purchaseState":0,"developerPayload":"yMK2ZwuMJffsdfYe42DArIGEj","purchaseToken":"fbmgejjjgmajphcimfahikei.AO-J1OzibvxeTh-usNqQOYOylLmEIvYKG6rrY4YzPFBzkzpEvIyRssgTAg6dj9nVfQ-sA3vtuF5E6Bdo1rfTJcVdEKiM6jbdb8yDPst3lN-VEXthWrnCXp-6C4KGr12LGi0fT_G4SZVj","autoRenewing":false} </code></pre>  <p>But when user buy a plan a added in managed products  then we get the <strong>orderID</strong> in the response:</p>  <pre><code>{"orderId":"GPA.1281-9328-9424-48661","packageName":"package name","productId":"my+managed_product_plan","purchaseTime":1443093999592,"purchaseState":0,"developerPayload":"zQNLJ1XVSUSPN52ZXFDU","purchaseToken":"bfkkggcofifdegdpccpikmog.AO-J1Ow_9AvGxayb-7eIYCLvd6Hq7PyiFbrdncUr5yZkkSJrqd58jnNGCDKwLxRbjbqJ8fL50p3AAP-tsw-tJ499_Cn5dz3eNMO7oMeMxEvAxrw9hgPjvuAeg_YRO3d6VV3i5McdMTst"} </code></pre>  <p>So i am not able to catch why I am not getting orderId in case of subscription. Does google provide <strong>orderId</strong> in case of managed products only.</p>  <p>I have tried doing the payment many times after adding test accounts but every time I get <strong>orderId</strong> for managed products items only not when we subscribe. Please suggest. Thanks</p>
