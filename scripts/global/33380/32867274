<p>By using Google Play Developer API and the call <code>https://www.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v2/applications/{packageName}/purchases/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/tokens/{token}</code> (<a href="https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/purchases/subscriptions/get" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/purchases/subscriptions/get</a>) it is possible to get information about if the subscription is still valid. </p>  <p>How do I find out the <code>orderId</code> for each payment without guessing (by doing like this: <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_subscriptions.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_subscriptions.html</a>)? Is it possible to, through a service-account-call to the API, get all historical payments for a subscription for a user? (By using the purchaseToken and subscriptionId for example).</p>
