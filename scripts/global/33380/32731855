<p>I'm newbie if it comes to the in-app purchase subject. I'm the manager of the online finance web project, where users can buy different types of year's subscription.</p>  <p>We have also the mobile app for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. On Android platform, users can buy only one type of the subscription. Price is the same as on the website (value in PLN currency). Currently we work on the possibility, to buy two types of the subscription via iOS (in-app purchase).</p>  <p>Unfortunately, in iTunes Connect you can't set a custom price of a product (in PLN currency) - you can choose only predefined tiere.</p>  <p>I can't find similar tiere to my prices available on the website. What should I do? They should be a bit higher or lower vs prices on the website (to get as far as a similar amount in EUR)? I can't set identical prices. Is this not a problem vs Apple Apps Guidelines? Thanks in advance for any info.</p>  <p>Best, Jakub</p>
