<p>I'm using Cordova with Visual Studio 2015, in my app I have to buy and download content implemented every month. So I can't give to the user a default list, I prefer link all the virtual content on a page in the server.</p>  <p>How can I do this? Is possible with Android and Ios?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
