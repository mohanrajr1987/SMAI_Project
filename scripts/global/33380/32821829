<p>I am developing a new application which is using auto renew in app purchase. My app is use for studying language and after loading videos from the cloud we will show them for students. If students subscribe our app, they can view all contents for duration. But according to apple review guideline:   <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/</a></p>  <h3>Apps may only use auto-renewing subscriptions for periodicals (newspapers, magazines), business Apps (enterprise, productivity, professional creative, cloud storage), and media Apps (video, audio, voice), or the App will be rejected</h3>  <p>I wonder if my app can be accepted by Apple </p>  <p>Thanks </p>
