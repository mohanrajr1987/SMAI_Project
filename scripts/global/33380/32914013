<p>Before asking this question, I have read the developer notes on android developers <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_admin.html" rel="nofollow">site</a> and also watched the Google IO video. I have also seen the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14068781/adding-in-app-purchase-to-existing-published-application-and-testing-it-without">question</a> posted on SO. Since the question has been asked long ago and its answers are also pretty aged, it doesn't answer my doubts reason being Google has changed quite a few things related to In App Billing and its testing.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I am planning to add in app purchase to my app which I published long ago in play store. I wrote the code of in app  billing V3 ytaking help from <code>TrivialDrive</code> example. I have few doubts on how do I proceed further for testing:</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>[Question]</strong>    </p>  <ol> <li>I have read that I should upload the new apk which includes in app billing code and permission to play store's <code>in-app products</code>. Won't that make the upgrade available to all the users using previous version of app? Once I upload the new apk with in app billing feature, it would replace the older apk in production, right? If yes, how do I make sure the upgrade goes to production only when I am done with testing? </li> <li>When I click on button for in-app purchase, it displays an alert dialog with following error:<br> <code>Authentication is required. You need to sign in to your Google Account.</code>  </li> </ol>
