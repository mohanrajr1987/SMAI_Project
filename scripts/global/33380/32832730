<p>Does Parse's <code>PFProduct</code> class have any support for getting info from iTunes about pricing, etc? I know that you can use Parse to purchase and restore products so it has a connection with the <code>StoreKit</code> frameworks, but I don't see anything about pricing or other iTunes metadata. Do I have to do these queries myself?</p>  <p>Just trying to understand the relationship between Parse products and Apple's <code>StoreKit</code> products, and when I have to directly use either one.</p>
