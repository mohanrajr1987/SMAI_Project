<p>I created a simple in-app purchase product, with a single mp3 file in it as content. I set it up in itunes connect, uploaded the pkg file, everything went well - the product is recognized from within my app, the user can buy it, the confirmation comes as expected, however, there is a small problem: when the transaction state changes to "purchased", I call the content download method, to start downloading the mp3 file, however, the update method never gets called (- (void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedDownloads:(NSArray *)downloads), instead the transaction gets removed.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong? Where should I call the start download method from below?</p>  <pre><code>if (transaction.downloads) {     [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] startDownloads:transaction.downloads]; } </code></pre>
