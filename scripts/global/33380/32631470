<p>I have a working app made with Xamarin.Android, and I'm trying to add in-app purchases with the component <a href="http://components.xamarin.com/view/xamarin.inappbilling" rel="nofollow">Xamarin.InAppBilling</a> v2.2</p>  <p>I use this code with my public key from the Google Play Developer Console. </p>  <pre><code>_serviceConnection = new InAppBillingServiceConnection(activity, InAppBillingPublicKey); _serviceConnection.OnConnected += LoadProducts; _serviceConnection.Connect(); </code></pre>  <p>It fails with this exception message: "Service Intent must be explicit: Intent { act=com.android.vending.billing.InAppBillingService.BIND }"</p>  <p>I can find others talking about this for plain android development, but not for Xamarin and this component. How do I make the component have the service intent set explicitly? Is there another way to to in-app-purchases in Xamarin.Android?</p>  <p>From other posts, I have found and tried this:</p>  <pre><code>var intent = new Intent("com.android.vending.billing.InAppBillingService.BIND"); intent.SetPackage("com.android.vending"); activity.BindService(intent, _serviceConnection, Bind.AutoCreate);  </code></pre>  <p>But it still won't work. I get the same error. </p>
