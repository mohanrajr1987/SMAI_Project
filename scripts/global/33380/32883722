<p>I do an application in two versions: premium and free. Now for me the functional of premium version works after verification of:</p>  <pre><code>  if (isPremiumVersion){      //to do premium fuctions   }. </code></pre>  <p>But I do not think that it is good tone. How is it possible to divide these two versions, that they were independent of each other? Only at the start of application to do verification, and then already, for example, to start the certain manifest file with a certain package, and classes. Unfortunately, does not turn out to find material, how more correct to do it.</p>
