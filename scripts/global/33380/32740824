<p>This is my first app for iOS. I'm using Apache Cordova with the "cordova-plugin-purchase" for IAP. Since I have no experience with the app store and IAP, it's a bit hard to find out what I'm doing wrong. I tried following all the rules and guides I could find. I'm not sure if authentication with my sandbox user does not work or if my usage of the store API is wrong.</p>  <ol> <li>My app and IAP have not yet been submitted for review. Is it correct to assume that I can test IAP in sandbox mode, before submitting the app for review?</li> </ol>  <p>I'm running the app on my test device, directly from Xcode, so it should be signed with the development key.</p>  <p>I've created several sandbox users in iTunes Connect. Some of the I've verified, others I didn't, since I read somewhere that by verifying I take them into production environment and the become invalid in sandbox. I've removed my previous account data from the test device in "Settings -> iCloud" and "Settings -> iTunes &amp; App Store".</p>  <ol start="2"> <li>The prompt that asks for an Apple ID does not have "Environment: Sandbox" in its title. But it should, right?</li> </ol>  <p>After I enter the Apple ID and password, the prompt comes right back empty. The might be an error in my code, since in the console log it says "Current store account has changed from (null) to 8465870979" on the first try.</p>  <ol start="3"> <li>After that, the Apple ID is stored in "Settings -> iTunes &amp; App Store". Like a production Apple ID. Is that correct?</li> </ol>  <p>Please see the console log on pastebin: <a href="http://pastebin.com/En3dHtBv" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/En3dHtBv</a></p>  <p>Can you give me some pointers please? I'm starting to run out of ideas and have been trying for two days now. By the way, the same code works on Google Play, so I guess I'm using the plugin correctly and authentication with my sandbox user is not working for some reason.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance! :)</p>
