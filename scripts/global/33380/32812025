<p>I know that this question may have been asked several times, sorry, but I really can't find out how can I submit my first app product to the iTunes Connect. The In App Purchase section keep saying something like "Your first in app purchase must be send with a new app version", but my app is still in development and so it would be rejected.</p>  <p>Where do I have to upload it for approval?</p>
