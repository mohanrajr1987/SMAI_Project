<p>I am developing an iOS app and I would like to receive payments within the app. I am selling a "real" good/service, so my profit margin on each sale is only around 20%. I can't afford to pay Apple 30% on each purchase made within the app.</p>  <p>What are my options for accepting payment without giving Apple a 30% cut?</p>
