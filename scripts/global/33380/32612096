<p>I'm about to do a partnership to propose some content in an Android app through in-app purchases. My partner wants that a purchase can be used on 5 devices maximum. Isn't that against the in-app purchase rules (a purchase should be available on all the user's devices)? It is against Apple ones, but I can't find any relevant information for Android.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
