<p>I am currently building an Android application (with Phonegap) where users will be able to purchase in-app items to unlock some content.</p>  <p>This content will be added through a back-office, and if the user purchases it, he will be able to download and display it in the application.</p>  <p>My question is: <strong>Can I programmatically add an in-app purchase item (with an API ?) to my Android developer account when creating the content into my back-office ?</strong></p>  <p>Thank you guys, Axel</p>
