<p>Please, help me to clarify purchases types.  I have an ionic project, where a user has a possibility to post to feed. But he/she has to pay for each news he/she posts.  I know that purchases are of three types: consumable, non-consumable and subscriptions.</p>  <p>I cant understand <strong>what is the type of such kind of purchases</strong>?</p>
