<p>Good day, Could be simple fix, but I am struggling.. I got a combo box to find and move to particular record in the form. Works fine with one column. I want to have 3 columns ( Name, E-MailID, Mobile No) to be displayed. Done no issues. Bound column is 1. Works fine with 'Name'.</p>  <p>Now, when I try to find a record based on E-mailID / mobile no, it is not working.</p>  <p>How to make it find the record based on any one of the 3 columns ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
