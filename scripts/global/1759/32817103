<p>I have a list of items in my combo box. I need to save the selected item only into a text file. My idea is something like this. </p>  <pre><code>    Dim stream As New System.IO.FileStream("C:\CONFIG\PA.txt", IO.FileMode.Append, IO.FileAccess.Write)     Dim write As New System.IO.StreamWriter(stream)     Dim PA As String = (ComboBox1.SelectedItem)     write.WriteLine(PA) </code></pre>  <p>But I couldn't figure out the correct way to do it. Can anyone help? Thank you in advance.</p>
