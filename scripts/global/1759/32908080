<p>I am using Silverlight 5 and can easily catch a right click of the mouse and have it override the default Silverlight Context menu. I have set the the RightMouseButtonDown event of the Silverlight Page to catch it on any element within the page. However if a ComboxBox has it's dropdown open then right click refers back to default context menu. What am I missing to be able to catch these right clicks too?</p>
