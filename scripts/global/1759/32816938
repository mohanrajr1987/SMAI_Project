<p>It's an extension to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32561924/how-to-stop-jface-combo-box-from-re-sizing-on-a-window-re-size">this</a> question. The combobox is resized but it is showing the last characters of the long string. How would I always force the combobox to show the string from the start?  I checked all the provided methods by ComboBox in jface, but none could qualify to do the task. So I am assuming I would have to write a function for it. But how to go about writing it and attaching that value to combobox.  Problem : How it is now How I would like it to be.
