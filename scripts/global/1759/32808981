<p>Is it possible to save a new item in a combobox? (Delphi)</p>  <p>If you say for ex. <code>Combobox1.Items.Add('Item');</code> then that item will appear in the combobox for the duration of the program's run, however if you close and reopen the program then that item is gone.</p>  <p>Is it possible to somehow add that item permanently through code at runtime?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
