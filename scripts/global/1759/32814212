<p>Edited at the suggestion or responders:</p>  <p>Have also split into a number of different threads</p>  <p>I primarily develop in Access with VBA and some experience of VB some time ago. One of my current projects involves a very dynamic form where users can move and resize a variety of controls (primarily lines, ovals and rectangles for room layouts). However in Access this can result in a lot of screen flicker whilst this process is going on, so I decided to look at using vb.net and WPF as an alternative - it also meant I could develop in parallel and learn more about the differences between the two products. </p>  <p>Ideally I'm hoping someone can point me in the direction of a resource which details the differences between equivalent Access and WPF forms and controls.</p>  <p>A case in point is I've hit a stumbling block with combo boxes. </p>  <p>A standard Access functionality is type ahead in comboboxes - Is this functionality available in WPF comboboxes? If so, how do I implement it?</p>  <p>Another standard Access functionality is being able to show multiple columns on the dropdown - How would I do this in WPF? </p>
