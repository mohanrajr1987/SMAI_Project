<p>Is it possible to define a combo box list based on the results of two cells?</p>  <p>Basically I have 4 lists to choose from: </p>  <ul> <li>Non Recurring Deduction</li> <li>Recurring Deduction</li> <li>Non Recurring Payment</li> <li>Recurring Payment</li> </ul>  <p>The user will select Both the Type (Payment/Deduction) and if it is recurring/non recurring. I would like these two cells to define the list that appears in the combo-box. Iâ€™d like a combo box as it looks better and has the ability to populate as the user types.</p>  <p>I would take a crack at it myself but I have only just stared looking at combo boxes today but not sure how to make sure the right range is selected with the "Me.ComboBox1.List =". There also seems to be very few online resources with regards to dynamic lists.</p>
