<p>I have created a user form to enter data.</p>  <p>One functionality I intend to include is <strong>SEARCH, based on value entered in TEXT BOX, which should accordingly populate values in a COMBO BOX and then clicking the SEARCH should display the results in LIST BOX</strong>.</p>  <p>In TEXT BOX either SR Number or PO# will be added and then it should populate value in COMBO, and when search is clicked, it should display related result in Listbox</p>  <p>I have attached screen shots of the user form interface for better understanding of requirements. </p>  <p>Details - </p>  <p><strong>Worksheets</strong> - Sheet2 "Database" (This is the sheet were data from user form gets updated)</p>  <p><strong>Columns</strong> -</p>  <p>"B:B" - (column for SR Number) "C:C" - (column for Site Code) "E:E" - (column for Maintenance Po#) "F:F" - (column for Project Manager)</p>  <p>Name of Boxes - </p>  <p>Text Box - txtsearch Combo Box - cbxsitecode Command Btn - cmdsearch ListBox - lbsearch</p>  <p>I couldn't attach the screen shot of entire user form as it required at least 10 reputation. I am very new to VBA coding, so your guidance will be much helpful and appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>
