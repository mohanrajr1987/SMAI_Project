<p>I'm using MFC to build an application with two dialogs. When I press a button in the parent dialog a new window including a Combobox should apprear.</p>  <p>I created a first dialog with a button "New". This button will open the second dialog. Therefor I created a second dialog with a Combobox. The Combobox has a linked variable <code>variableCombobox</code>. The second class is called <code>CSecond</code>.</p>  <p>Before I do anything in the new dialog I want to add an item to the Combobox. In the first dialog class I create the new window like this:</p>  <pre><code>void CFirstDlg::OnBnClickedNew() {     CSecond dlg2 = new CSecond();     dlg2.variableCombobox.AddString(L"test");     dlg2.DoModal(); } </code></pre>  <p>The program crashes in the line I want to add the <code>test</code> string to the Combobox showing an assertion error. I noticed that the <code>dlg2</code> object is <code>null</code> but I don't know why.</p>  <p>Can anyone tell me how to create a second window immediately adding an new item in the Combobox of the second window?</p>
