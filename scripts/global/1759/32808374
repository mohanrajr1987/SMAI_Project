<p>I got a combobox ("cmb") with a dataset (Surname, Prename etc) behind it.</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub cmb_Format (...) Handles cmb.Format     e.ListItem.Value = row.Item("SURNAME") &amp; " " &amp; row.Item("PRENAME") End Sub </code></pre>  <p>With this method I kind of overwrite the DisplayMember.</p>  <p>The problem is that if I choose one listitem by the Dropdown the textfield writes BOTH (PRENAME and SURNAME) but I just want to have the SURNAME.</p>  <p>I tried several hours, but no success :(</p>
