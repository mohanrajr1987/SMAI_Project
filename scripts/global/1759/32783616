<p>I have a combobox that gets populated with information sourced from an Access Database. I have a method that opens up records using a ADO Recordset. I have a multicolumn combobox that I want to select a value from the populated list on the form. For single column combobox's, the value that gets shown on the form is populated using the value property as shown below.</p>  <pre><code> frmDataEntry.txtProcessID = sourceRS.Fields("ProcessID").Value </code></pre>  <p>I am having issues populating a multicolumn combobox as the Value property does not work. </p>  <pre><code>Do Until y &gt;= frmDataEntry.cmbProcess.listCount      If frmDataEntry.cmbProcess.List(y, 0) = sourceRS.Fields("ProcessID").Value Then         'This is where i'd like to set the value     End If     y = y + 1 Loop </code></pre>  <p>In the code above, if this were a listbox, i would use <code>.Selected(y) = True</code> property but that is not available for comboboxes. Does anybody have any suggestions? I have searched everywhere but cannot seem to find a way to do this without wiping out the populated list of the combobox.</p>
