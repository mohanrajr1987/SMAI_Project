<p>It seems like <code>ComboBox</code> behaves a lot different in Windows 7 compared to Windows 8.</p>  <p>Consider the following example: </p>  <pre><code>import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.control.ComboBox; import javafx.scene.layout.VBox; import javafx.stage.Stage;  public class TestCombo extends Application {      @Override     public void start(Stage stage) {          VBox root = new VBox();          ComboBox&lt;String&gt; comboBox = new ComboBox&lt;String&gt;();         comboBox.setEditable(true);          comboBox.getItems().addAll("One", "Two", "Three");          ComboBox&lt;String&gt; dummyBox = new ComboBox&lt;String&gt;();         dummyBox.setEditable(true);          comboBox.valueProperty().addListener((obs, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {             System.out.println("Value property: " + newValue);         });           comboBox.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty().addListener((obs, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {             System.out.println("SelectedItem property: " + newValue);         });          root.getChildren().addAll(comboBox, dummyBox);         Scene scene = new Scene(root);               stage.setScene(scene);         stage.show();     }      public static void main (String[] args) {         launch();     } } </code></pre>  <p>In Windows 8: If I write "foo" in the first combo box, and then focus the second combo box. It will generate this output:</p>  <pre><code>SelectedItem property: foo Value property: foo </code></pre>  <p>In Windows 7, this wont generate any output at all. In Windows 7, the value property or selectedItem property doesn't change when you write your input until you press enter.</p>  <p>On the other hand: If I choose an alternative in the combo box popup, the value and selectedItem property behaves identical in Windows 7 and 8.</p>  <p>Isn't it a quite serious problem that their behaviour differ so much depending on the platform?</p>  <p>Anyway. It is a problem for me. I do not want to add a listener to the text property of the combo box editor, because this will result in the listener getting called everytime the user adds one character to the combo box. I just want a listener that reacts when the user has written some input in the combobox and switched focus, or when he has selected an option from the combo box popup. And it needs to be platform independent. I.e: I want the windows 8 behaviour of value and selectedItem property in both Windows 7 and 8 (and on any other platform).</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>When I wrote this, Java version was 1.8.0_45 on both platforms. When I updated both to 1.8.0_60 The value and selectedItem property behaviour became identical on both platforms.</p>  <p>However. I still want a listener that reacts when the user has written some input in the combobox and switched focus, or when he has selected an option from the combo box popup and switched focus. Should I just add a listener to the focus property that checks the editor text when ever the combo box loses focus, or is there a better way?</p>
