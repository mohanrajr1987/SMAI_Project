<p>I am a new VB.Net programmer using Visual Studio 2015.</p>  <p>I need to enumerate a set of folders in a path and use those folder names to populate a ComboBox so that I can select that folder with my application.</p>  <p>The folders will have an identifier such as - </p>  <p>\Folder1.kma \Folder2.kma \Folder3.kma \Folder4.kma</p>  <p>I only want folders with the .kma extension to be used to populate the ComboBox. All other folders will be ignored.</p>  <p>How do I locate just those folders? How do I use the results to populate the ComboBox?</p>
