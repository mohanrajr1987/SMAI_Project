<p>I have a very basic doubt. Is it possible to create a class in which objects can be created using '=' operator (just like Integer/String class) rather than using "new CustomClass()". </p>  <p>Consider a class named CustomClass. I need to define my class just a way that it works just like Integer/String class in terms of the syntax for create objects.</p>  <p>Eg. In order to create Integer object we write, Integer pInt = 10 or String pStr = "testWorld"; LikeWise, I want objects of my custom class "CustomClass" to be created using simple syntax like CustomClass custObj = 45;</p>
