<p>This is obviously bad:</p>  <pre><code>int&amp; GetInvalidIntPtr(){    int i;    return i; } </code></pre>  <p>This is my example:</p>  <pre><code>FVector&amp; GetDirectionFromCamera(){     return GetActorLocation() - GetCameraComponent()-&gt;GetComponentLocation();  } </code></pre>  <p>An FVector basically holds 3 floats, that is why I'd like to return the reference rather than a copy. However, I believe <strong>the result of the calculation</strong> is stored on the stack, right? <br> Or is the result allocated on the heap because I am immediatly returning it?</p>
