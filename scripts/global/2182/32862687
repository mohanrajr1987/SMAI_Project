<p>I'm trying to access <strong>myVariable</strong> outside this function. Please see the code below:</p>  <pre><code>var myVariable; function drawBasic(){ ...   myVariable = document.getElementById('chart_div3');   var chart = new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));   google.visualization.events.addListener(chart, 'ready', function () {         chart_div.innerHTML = '&lt;img src="' + chart.getImageURI() + '"&gt;';          myVariable.innerHTML = chart.getImageURI();          myVariable = myVariable.innerHTML;          //prints out desired value         console.log(myVariable);   });  //prints out desired value console.log(myVariable); ... } //prints out undefined     console.log(myVariable); </code></pre>  <p>I know that <strong>myVariable</strong> is defined outside the function so I was hoping it could be set inside the function and then the value could be used anywhere else, but I was wrong. So my question would be how can I get the value of chart.getImageURI() and store it as a value outside the function drawBasic?</p>
