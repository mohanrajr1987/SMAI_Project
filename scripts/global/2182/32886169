<p>I was reading about the best methods to create objects in javascript and found an interesting solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1597560/2011284">here</a>.  </p>  <pre><code>var Foo = function() {      var privateStaticMethod = function() {};     var privateStaticVariable = "foo";      var constructor = function Foo(foo, bar)     {         var privateMethod = function() {};         this.publicMethod = function() {};     };      constructor.publicStaticMethod = function() {};      return constructor; }(); </code></pre>  <p>I have been playing with this structure but I was wondering how can I do a few things.  </p>  <ul> <li><p>How can I access <code>privateStaticVariable</code> or <code>privateStaticMethod</code> from within <code>constructor.publicStaticMethod</code>?</p></li> <li><p>If I create a second public method like <code>constructor.secondPublicStaticMethod  = function(){};</code>,  how can I access it from within <code>constructor.publicStaticMethod</code>?</p></li> <li><p>If I was to instantiate this object, how could I access all static properties and methods from within <code>constructor</code>?</p></li> </ul>
