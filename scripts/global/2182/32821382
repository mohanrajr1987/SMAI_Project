<p>I have two windows form. From form1 I connect to my server and as an output I get session id in a xml form. I parse the value and store it in a variable name session id. Now in form2 I need to use the session Id which I received in the previous form . How to do it? I was making the object of that class and using the data member but as the scope of the program gets over the value in the variable get removed. </p>
