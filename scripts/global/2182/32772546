<p>Is there anyway to write a scope statement that would scope on all members of a date hierarchy except the [All] member?</p>  <p>I have tried many many ways using FILTER, EXCEPT, DESCENDANTS, ect but every time, I get the error message saying: <em>An arbitrary shape of the sets is not allowed in the current context.</em></p>  <p>I need to do some calculations at levels lower than the ALL member and then, let it rollup contextually (according to the excel pivot table selection)</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>This has been on my plate for almost a week now and I've found no way around it other than writing multiple scope statements for each level of the hierarchy but in the end I will have to repeat this many times as we are doing this for many date dimensions</p>  <p>There has to be a simpler way, right?</p>
