<h2>EDIT</h2>  <p>This is not a duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4968406/javascript-property-access-dot-notation-vs-brackets">JavaScript property access: dot notation vs. brackets?</a> That question concerns accessing a variable, not naming a variable.</p>  <h2>/EDIT</h2>  <p>I'm looping through a set of matched elements returned from jquery. I want to initially remove these elements from the <code>DOM</code> and be able to <code>attach()</code> and <code>remove()</code> at a whim later on outside the scope of the containing function. Obviously, I need to put these elements inside a variable with global scope. The syntax for that would be <code>window.addVariableNameHere = whatever</code>. </p>  <p><strong>If I'm creating those variable names on the fly, how would I do that? Crap that isn't working:</strong></p>  <pre><code>window.test+1 window.'test'+1 var newName = 'test' + 1;   window.newName = whatever //works but can only access window.newName, now window.test1 like you would think. </code></pre>  <p>Where I need this to work:</p>  <pre><code>$('.elements').each(function(i){     //window.element + i }); </code></pre>
