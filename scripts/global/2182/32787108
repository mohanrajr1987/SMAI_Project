<p>I am trying to set property value on $scope inside of an AJAX callback. Actually, I am trying to set it inside of a nested AJAX callback. </p>  <p>See the code below.</p>  <pre><code>equipmentService.deleteItem($scope.idToDelete).success(function (response) {     if (response) {         equipmentService.updateList($scope.listDetail).success(function (response) {             if (response) {                 $scope.selectedId = null;                 $scope.$apply();                 $scope.alerts.push({ type: 'success', msg: 'Changes saved successfully.' });             }         });     } }; </code></pre>  <p>The value of $scope.selectedId is, in fact null inside the callback block. However, outside of the callback block its value hasn't changed. </p>  <p>Most of my searches on problems like this suggest $scope.$apply as the cure for all AngularJs problems. Unfortunately, I've never been able to get it to do anything at all.</p>  <p>Clearly, I'm missing something here. Can anyone give me a clue?</p>
