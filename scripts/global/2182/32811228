<p>I am trying to get some configuration from an external js file, so it seems I need to do that within a <code>$(document).ready(function(){....</code>. The variable that holds the config object needs to be globally accessible to all functions. There isn't any reason for all functions to be within a document ready function.</p>  <p>From what I have read, the following should make <code>app.config</code> available globally, but it does not!</p>  <pre><code>window.app = {};  $(document).ready(function(){     app.config = window[$('body').attr('data-app')]; });  console.log(app.config); </code></pre>  <p>This produces the error <code>app.config is undefined</code>. I assume the variable would be accessible globally within the document ready, but I need it to be globally available everywhere. How would I do this? If possible an explanation of scope in and out of document ready would be appreciated!</p>
