<p>I just started learning Ruby and am currently trying to figure out what this syntax means. It looks like a variable name ( <em>path</em> ) next to a method definition. It is not in parentheses, so it's not a parameter. Maybe a method-level variable? </p>  <pre><code>def get_path path    if clause       @path = n    else       @path = m    end    return @path end </code></pre>  <p>No arguments are passed to this method. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
