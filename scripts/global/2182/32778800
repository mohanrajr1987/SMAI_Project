<p>I am passing HttpServletRequest object to a Thread and then returning it. The Thread is going to get executed for long duration but before that I return request. Hence I am unable to access the HttpServletRequest object in Thread. So is there any way to persist HttpServletRequest object throughout the Threads execution even after completing its session ?</p>  <pre><code> public String execute(HttpServletRequest request){        Runnable r = new RunnableImplementation(request);        Thread t = new Thread(r);        t.start();        return "Success";     } </code></pre>  <p>Note : Constructor of RunnableImplementation initialize its local HttpServletRequest object and then it is used in its run() method.</p>
