<p>Sometimes I see SQL Server's cursor declaration as <a href="http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2007/01/01/sql-server-simple-example-of-cursor/" rel="nofollow">variable</a> and sometimes <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms180169.aspx" rel="nofollow">not</a></p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @getAccountID CURSOR  DECLARE vend_cursor CURSOR </code></pre>  <p>What is the significance and difference between the two manner of declaration ? Perhaps scope ?</p>
