<p>I need to declare the variable <code>a</code> somewhere, and using javascript technics make it visible for <code>f2</code> function being called inside the <code>f1</code> function. But being called directly (outside of the <code>f1</code> function) the <code>f2</code> function must fail to print a. I can't use eval. I can't change the f2 function. I can change the f1 function however I want. Is that possible at all?</p>  <pre><code>function f1(var_name){     f2(); } function f2(){     console.log(a); } f1();  // must log value of the a f2();  // must not be able to log a </code></pre>
