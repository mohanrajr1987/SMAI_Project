<p><strong>Or why a global variable do not change on a mixin scope when passed by @content directive ?</strong></p>  <p>I'm defining $color variable as global, and its value has been set inside a mixin. When I call this mixin, I want to have $color as it's mixin value, but, passing the variable by @content directive, I always get the global value:</p>  <pre><code>$color: #000 !default;  @mixin generate-fruits() {     @each $fruit, $fruit-color in $fruits {         $color: $fruit-color;         .#{$fruit}{             @content;              //  Awaited result             // background: $color;         }     } }  @include generate-fruits(){   background: $color; }; </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>result:</strong>    background gets black; </p>      <p><strong>expected:</strong>   background gets $fruit-color</p> </blockquote>  <p>It seems @content has been parsed before the Mixin action. <strong>How can I force @content to keep the *mixin scope</strong>?</p>  <p>Please, find out a simplified version of the problem <a href="http://codepen.io/gabrielagabriel/pen/WQGOdW" rel="nofollow">on codePen</a>. </p>
