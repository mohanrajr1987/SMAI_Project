<p>I finally was able to figure out how to remove the text from this element but save the button which was nested in it. </p>  <p>HTML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="modal" class="modal-animation"&gt;     &lt;p id="output"&gt;This app will go through some of your markup to determmine if it could be more accessible.  We will start by checking the alt tags on your images, seeing if they exist, or if the tags are empty!&lt;br&gt;     &lt;a id="appButtonNextChecker" class="button button-primary modal-button"&gt;lets get started!&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>JS:</p>  <pre><code>EventUtility.addHandler(newBtnName, 'click', function(e) {      var $noRemove = $('#output').find('#appButtonNextChecker'),          text = 'flim-flam ' + $noRemove;          console.log('next Checker, button!');                  $('#output').html(text); }); </code></pre>  <p>I then tried to concatenate a new string with the button I saved, but to my surprise I received <code>[object Object]</code>?</p>  <p>I read somewhere it was a scoping issue, but I am not sure how that applies here? Any help would be appreciated!</p>
