<p>extremely new developer here.<br> Trying to make an expenses calculator in which the sum of inputted integers from a table (each of which have a specific default value) become the int value of another variable. I feel like I'm missing something simple but I can't for the life of me figure out what.  </p>  <p>The javascript/angular below</p>  <pre><code>var app = angular.module('expenses', []); app.controller('mainCtrlr', function($scope) {     var expenseTotal&lt;----variable I cannot get to work      var expenseOne;     var expenseTwo;     var expenseThree;      $scope.expenseOne = 270;     $scope.expenseTwo = 265;     $scope.expenseThree= 65; }); </code></pre>  <p>populates the data of this table </p>  <pre><code>&lt;div ng-app="expenses" ng-controller="mainCtrlr"&gt; &lt;table&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt; Expense &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type= int ng-model="expenseOne"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;Other Expense &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=int ng-model= "expenseTwo"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;Third Expense &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=int ng-model= "expenseThree"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;/table&gt; Total {{expenseTotal}} &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I can't get {{expenseTotal}} to show anything other than NaN.  I'd like it to be a usable variable that will factor into other equations, but be based on the sum of the expenses.  Does anyone know what else needs to be in my javascript file to make this work?</p>  <p>thanks in advance and I'm sorry if it's been asked before but I couldn't find it anywhere.</p>
