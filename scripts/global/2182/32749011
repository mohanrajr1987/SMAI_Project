<p>I am trying to limit the amount of tries a person has when attempting to guess the random number. I get this error code when I run the program and can't figure out what to do next. </p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:/Python27/coding/Guess.py", line 34, in &lt;module&gt;     main()   File "C:/Python27/coding/Guess.py", line 24, in main     trys(userGuess)   File "C:/Python27/coding/Guess.py", line 29, in trys     trysLeft -= 1 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'trysLeft' referenced before assignment </code></pre>  <p>The code:</p>  <pre><code>import random      def main():      print "Guess a number between 1 and 100."     randomNumber = random.randint(1,100)     found = False     trysLeft = 5      while not found:          userGuess = input("Your guess: ")           if userGuess == randomNumber:              print "You got it!"              found = True          elif userGuess &gt; randomNumber:             trys()             print "Guess lower!"          else:             trys()             print "Guess higher!"  def trys():      trysLeft -= 1     print "You have %d trys left." %trysLeft   if __name__ == "__main__":     main() </code></pre>
