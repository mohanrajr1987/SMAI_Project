<p>If I have a string with value 'order.buyer.address.street' and there exists an order object on the scope, how do I get to the address object?</p>  <p>I mean, is there an angular function (such as $parse,...) that can be used to get to the address object?</p>  <p>I know I could split the string and iterate to the object, but I want to know if there is an easier way to do this.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
