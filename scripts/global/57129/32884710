<p>I'm using Coffeescript . My source in autocomplete method returns me a hash (associated array) and i want to show some elements in dropdown list . I explain you more below</p>  <p>Firstly , I had this method calling in my coffeescript</p>  <pre><code>jQuery -&gt;     $("#searchbox").autocomplete         source: "/searches" </code></pre>  <p>And response was <br> <code>["St James's Hotel","Criterion Restaurant"]</code> <br> so dropdown shows these labels correctly . but now I have response like </p>  <pre><code>[ {"id":"ChIJD_XW2NcEdkgRS6oeZ95kXGo","label":"St James's Hotel"}, {"id":"ChIJYRe8_tMEdkgRr_J6bdITC1U","label":"Criterion Restaurant"} ] </code></pre>  <p>so no dropdown is made while above response is visible in console . and i want only labels to be shown in dropdown. I have coffeescript like below now :</p>  <pre><code>jQuery -&gt;     $("#searchbox").autocomplete         source: "/searches"         create: (event,ui) -&gt;          ui.item.label         select: (event,ui) -&gt;             console.dir ui             console.dir ui.item.id </code></pre>  <p>Any help/guidline will be appreciating</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong> According to the official doc, if your objects have "label" and "value" properties, jQuery would know how to use it. I 've also tried that thing too ( means without involving create option ) . thanks by the way , I'm updating my question according to that</p>
