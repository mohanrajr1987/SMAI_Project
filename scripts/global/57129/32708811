<p>I was debugging some UNION injection techniques with sqlmap and was wondering what are the variables I can use in the payloads.xml that will use number value in order instead of "NULL" and/or a static union character? </p>  <p>Seems like the creator of sqlmap created this tool to be purposely ineffective so that websites aren't easily hacked so I was just wondering instead of typing out manually for each column number order e.g. 1,2,3 then 1,2,3,4 then 1,2,3,4,5 and so forth, what are the variables I can use or anybody have an example I can use in payloads.xml that I can play with?</p>  <p>Penetration testing my websites and make sure they're solid.</p>  <p>Got reviewed and deny for having too many backticks around random words but the thing is I only have quotes around the word NULL above which is strange. Any idea?</p>
