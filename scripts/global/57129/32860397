<p>I am trying to understand Javascript a bit better and improve the way I write code. Know that my knowledge is very basic so I will appreciate your help and patient.</p>  <p>Take the following Coffeescript example:</p>  <pre><code>$.icDockSelected.scale = 0 $.icDockSelected.originY = 1 $.icDockSelected.opacity = 1 </code></pre>  <p>How can I optimise the way I compile this piece of code? Here's what I am trying to do:</p>  <pre><code>$.icDockSelected {scale: 0, origin: 1, opacity: 1 } </code></pre>  <p>Understand that the above is just a reference for what I am trying to achieve.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
