<p>I used followed a guide on how to install shmile on an RPI2 from this <a href="https://github.com/porkbuns/shmile/wiki/Shmile-on-the-Raspberry-Pi&gt;" rel="nofollow">link</a>. I used the command <code>PRINTER=true coffee app.coffee</code> on the terminal.  When I start the program I get a <code>printer is: false</code> but I specifically set it to true.  How do I get around this?  The printer is the only thing left for my whole photo-booth project.</p>
