<p><strong>Is there any way to intercept all Hubot triggers/response globally?</strong> The interception should be able to inspect, modify, forward, or reject Hubot response before being sent.  </p>  <p>Some goals I would like to achieve:</p>  <ul> <li>Throttle all message sent by Hubot (from all plugins/scripts) to prevent flooding.</li> <li>Apply some kind of ACL (Access Control List) to limit who can use a command.</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul>  <p>I cannot find it in the official Hubot documentation. Am I missing some things?</p>
