<p>I have a js.coffee.erb file and in this file there is a function which gets a 'equipment' json object (in javascript) and pastes some of the data to the html.<br> the json object is saved in variable called <code>eqp</code>.</p>  <p>Each equipment has a <code>category</code> (reference to other table object).<br> In the json object, there is only the <code>equipment.category_id</code>, so to get the category name I wrote this statement:</p>  <pre><code>$("#display_equipment_category_value").html &lt;%= Category.find(eqp.category_id).name %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that it can't defined a rails variable called <code>eqp</code> because it's not a rails object. </p>  <p>How could I save the js json <code>eqp.category_id</code> inside a rails variable?</p>  <pre><code>set_equipment = (eqp) -&gt;      &lt;% cat_id =  ?????  %&gt;      -     # save the eqp.category_id into cat_id     $("#display_equipment_category_value").html &lt;%= Category.find(cat_id).name %&gt; </code></pre>
