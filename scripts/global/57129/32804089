<p>I created Point class and Vector class in coffeescript. Both classes inherits MyObject class and constructor of both classes use super().</p>  <p>I want to transform Point into Vector. Therefore, I tried writing Vector.fromPoint() method. The method is used as constructor( <code>new Vector.fromPoint(new Point(x, y))</code> ).</p>  <p>However, I couldn't write it in coffeescript. Can it be written in coffeescript? I want to use MyObject.constructor as super() in the Vector.fromPoint constructor.</p>
