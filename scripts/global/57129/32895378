<p>I just finished reading <em>The Little Book on Coffeescript</em>, and I'm trying to get my head around the language. I'm trying to figure out how to do quite a plain vanilla bind. Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>times = (a = 1, b = 2) -&gt; a*b  h  = alert.bind times 8, 9     h </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't produce any errors but it also doesn't run any alerts. What am I doing wrong? </p>
