<p>Before read a lot of times my code because it's throwing me an:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: undefined is not a function   at facturaCtrl.get (/home/nano/Dev/erp-api/app/controllers/facturasController.coffee:18:13) </code></pre>  <p>I oficially get stuck. I'm writing a rest API and this is the first method on this controller, is very simple and i don't know why is tracing me that, here is the piece of code:</p>  <pre><code>get: (req, res) -&gt;     permission = req.user.canModifyFactura      if not permission       return res.json new Unauthorized("#{req.user.username} no tiene permisos")      Factura.find()       .exec (err, facturas) -&gt;         if err then return res.json new Internal(err.stack, err.message)         if not facturas or facturas.length is 0           return res.json new NotFound("No encontrado")          res.json new Ok(facturas) </code></pre>  <p>The line that trace is pointing me (18):</p>  <pre><code>Factura.find() </code></pre>  <p>But as i know (and use in other controllers) the <code>find()</code> function exists in mongoose... anyway, i think that is a stupid thing but i just don't see the problem before 1 hour. Here is the entire code <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/8995" rel="nofollow">Gitlab snippet link</a> I don't paste it here because is more than 100 lines of code, so...</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> the problem are not in the code of the controller, i just don't exported/imported the model correctly. Noob mistake.</p>
