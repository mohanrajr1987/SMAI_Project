<p>I have tabs and I want to have some kind of validation before the tab changes, to save someone's work. </p>  <p>What is actually happening is the tab just passes right through my code and then on the callback the message box opens after the tab has changed. This is because of the asynchronous Message box that Extjs provides. Still I am unable to find a viable solution. Any help would be greatly Appreciated.</p>  <p>Also the code is written in coffee script. I have Edited the post my code is now stuck in a infinite loop.</p>  <p>Here is what i have now.</p>  <pre><code>             beforetabchange:                 single:true                 fn:(tabPanel, newTab, oldTab, eOpts)-&gt;                     if oldTab.isModified &amp;&amp; oldTab.itemId != "linkedItemsTab" &amp;&amp; oldTab.itemId != "capacityTab" &amp;&amp; oldTab.itemId != "capacityTabEnterprise"                         Ext.Msg.show                             title: 'Warning'                             message: 'You have unsaved changes in the &lt;b&gt;' + oldTab.title + '&lt;/b&gt; tab, would you like to save them?'                             buttons: Ext.Msg.YESNOCANCEL                             icon: Ext.Msg.QUESTION                             fn: (btn) -&gt;                                 if (btn == 'yes')                                     tabPanel.suspendEvents()                                     oldTab.saveRelease (release, isChanged) -&gt;                                     highlight "Your changes have been saved"                                     oldTab.isModified = false                                 tabPanel.setActiveTab(newTab)                                 tabPanel.resumeEvents()                         return false;                     else if oldTab.isModified &amp;&amp; (oldTab.itemId == "capacityTab" or oldTab.itemId == "capacityTabEnterprise")                         Ext.Msg.show                             title: 'Warning'                             message: 'You have unsaved changes in the &lt;b&gt;' + oldTab.title + '&lt;/b&gt; tab, would you like to save them?'                             buttons: Ext.Msg.YESNOCANCEL                             icon: Ext.Msg.QUESTION                             fn: (btn) -&gt;                                 if (btn == 'yes')                                     tabPanel.suspendEvents()                                     me.saveActiveTabChanges()                                     highlight "Your changes have been saved"                                     oldTab.isModified = false                                 tabPanel.setActiveTab(newTab)                                 tabPanel.resumeEvents()                         return false;                     return true; </code></pre>
