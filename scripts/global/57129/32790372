<p>I want to basically generate a random mac address and put it in this url.</p>  <pre><code>url = 'http://localhost/visitor/login?switch_url=http://cnn.com&amp;client_mac=20:10:7a:66:98:7d&amp;wlan=tea&amp;redirect=www.cnn.com/' browser.get(url); </code></pre>  <p>I want to replace client_mac with random mac address.But how do I do it in protractor? Since we are using coffeescripts</p>  <p>How should I do that? I'm really unsure of it. I'm using Protractor (Selenium) with jasmine and coffee scripts.</p>
