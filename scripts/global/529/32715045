<p>I need to use the fileGDB driver in gdal, however I can't figure out how to install the driver.</p>  <p>This is the only kind of documentation I found but it doesn't make any sense to me: <a href="http://www.trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FileGDB" rel="nofollow">http://www.trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FileGDB</a><a href="http://www.trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FileGDB" rel="nofollow">1</a></p>  <p>Could somebody explain to me how to get this driver to work? My OS is Windows 10 with the gdal core-1600 64-bit from GISInternals.</p>
