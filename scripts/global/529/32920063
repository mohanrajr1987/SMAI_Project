<p>I'm trying to install latest Joomla (3.4.4) on a new host. Copied all files to server, fired up browser and I get the first install screen. However the box where you can select site online/offline is not visible and this results in next button not working.</p>  <p>When I look in Chrome devtools I can see 5 errors that all say :</p>  <pre><code>Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined.  </code></pre>  <p>I've never had this before. Any idea what I can do to fix this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, cheers, Peter</p>
