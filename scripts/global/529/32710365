<p>I am currently trying to get the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gssapi/1.1.3" rel="nofollow">gssapi module</a> for python to run on windows. My goal is to authenticate with an Active Directory using python module <a href="http://ldap3.readthedocs.org/" rel="nofollow">ldap3</a>. gssapi is an requirement for this to work. However, installation fails because it cannot find krb5-config. On Linux it is easy to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9714635/how-to-install-python-module-without-setup-py">install</a>. I installed <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/index.html#kfw-4.0" rel="nofollow">Kerberos for Windows</a> but it does not have krb5-config and I could not find it anywhere else (other than for Linux). Does anyone know where to find the required tools or how to continue (if it is possible at all)?</p>
