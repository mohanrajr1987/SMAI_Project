<p>I got the solution for joomla 3 installation problem(installation stucks in creating databases) in stackoverflow.</p>  <p>The solution that to <strong>replace "ENGINE=innoDB" with "ENGINE=MyIsam"</strong>    in </p>  <p><code>joomla-folder\installation\sql\mysql\joomla.sql, it works well.</code> </p>  <p>Anyone know the reason why innoDB is not working with joomla 3 installation.</p>  <p>And do I need to restore the engine from "MyIsam" to "innoDB" again(after installed successfully)?</p>
