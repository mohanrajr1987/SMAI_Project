<p>I am trying to install Oracle Hyperion on windows server 2012 R2. I have the files downloaded on one server. I have mapped this drive on a different server. When I try to run the cmd file by right clicking and select "Run as Administrator", it does not launch. I am using a service account which has administrators rights and part of local administrators group on the server. However when I copy the files to the local drive, it launches. I have four servers in the deployment and I dont want to copy the binaries to all the servers. Not sure why it doesn't launch when I launch it from the mapped drive.</p>  <p>The other issue is that when I try to launch the command prompt (Admin) and try to change the drive to the mapped drive, it does not change. It gives me this error.</p>  <p>C:\WINDOWS\system32>y: The system cannot find the drive specified.</p>  <p>But When I use the normal command prompt, it changes the drive. C:\Users\svc_hypadmin>y:</p>  <p>Y:></p>  <p>Any help is appreciated..</p>  <p>Regards, Ragav.</p>
