<p>I posted in other stack exchange programming forum but since it was not the appropriate forum I am reposting it. I do not have internet in one of my pc where I want to install GTK. I have internet in other pc, so I want to download and manually install in my PC. Can someone please explain step by step procedure. The details of my PC are windows 7 32 bit. Please help. </p>
