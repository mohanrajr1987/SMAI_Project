<p>I downloaded Android Studio and attempted to launch the Setup file "android-studio-bundle-141.2178183-windows".After extraction process I got <strong>NSIS Erorr</strong> and attempted twice to download got same response.</p>  <p>This is running on Windows8 32-bit with Java 1.8.0_11. During the installation 1st extraction of installation goes through just fine. However, when attempting the process, nothing happens just displaying the <strong>NSIS Erorr</strong> window.</p>
