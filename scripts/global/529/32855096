<h2>The Primary Question</h2>  <p>I'm trying to build the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/wiki/Standalone-Installation" rel="nofollow">linuxbrew standalone installation</a> on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, but the script in the original link is currently broken. My ideal answer would be a script that sets it up correctly in one go. I've <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahundt/1478c6771d1247b546c4" rel="nofollow">improved the script</a> to run with fewer hiccups. </p>  <h2>Current progress towards fixing the script</h2>  <p>I'm not able to get past a <code>crti.o</code> error when building gcc via linuxbrew as part of the standalone setup. However, I found some resources explaining the problem:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6329887/compiling-problems-cannot-find-crt1-o">stackoverflow crti.o</a></li> <li><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/251978/cannot-find-crti-o-no-such-file-or-directory">askubuntu crti.o</a></li> <li><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/738098" rel="nofollow">old launchpad bug</a></li> </ul>  <p>I searched for the file and it was right there!</p>  <pre><code>find -name crti.o ./.linuxbrew/lib/crti.o ./.linuxbrew/Cellar/glibc/2.19/lib/crti.o </code></pre>  <p>I'm currently on the following compiler error for <code>crtn.o</code>:</p>  <pre><code>/home/hbr/.linuxbrew/Cellar/binutils/2.25.1/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find crti.o: No such file or directory /home/hbr/.linuxbrew/Cellar/binutils/2.25.1/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lc /home/hbr/.linuxbrew/Cellar/binutils/2.25.1/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find crtn.o: No such file or directory collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status make[3]: *** [libgcc_s.so] Error 1 make[3]: Leaving directory `/tmp/gcc20150929-3726-hif3of/gcc-5.2.0/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/libgcc' make[2]: *** [all-stage1-target-libgcc] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory `/tmp/gcc20150929-3726-hif3of/gcc-5.2.0/build' make[1]: *** [stage1-bubble] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/gcc20150929-3726-hif3of/gcc-5.2.0/build' make: *** [bootstrap] Error 2 </code></pre>  <p>Essentially, at this step I need to figure out how to make sure brew/linuxbrew/the gcc compilation command knows where to find it. I tried adding it to <code>PATH</code>, <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code>, and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahundt/1478c6771d1247b546c4" rel="nofollow">the script</a> all without any luck. So, there must be some other way to make sure the path is set correctly and the object file is found. Any ideas?</p>  <p>Note: I originally searched for help in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/issues/530" rel="nofollow">this github issue</a> but they haven't been able to solve this at the moment.</p>
