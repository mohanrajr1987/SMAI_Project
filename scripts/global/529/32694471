<p>Before upgrading to <em>Delphi 10 Seattle</em> I got a demo copy in the site and tried  to install <em>GLscene</em> following strictly the instructions in <code>file:///C:/GLScene_VCL/_Installation/Installation.htm</code>.</p>  <p>Everything was going well and I could go up to the step 10 without serious problems including the “Compile All From Here”. It compiled correctly. Nevertheless when  I tried to “Install every DesignTime package of visual components to RAD Studio palette pages” in all of them I get an error of <em>Access Violation …</em> in module BDS.exe. I installed and re-installed the Delphi 10 and tried other times without success. I am almost sure that the cause is something related to the path of the libraries. Can anyone help me?</p>
