<p>I've been trying to install Solum locally (first on Windows, then on Ubuntu) since about 3 weeks ago, with no success.</p>  <p>There have been four distinct attempts I've tried:</p>  <p>A. <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Solum/solum_m2_demo" rel="nofollow">Installing m2 demo of Solum</a> - installation seems succesful, but fails on the last step - ie. connecting via browser. VagrantBox's port 9001 is forwarded, the route is pingable, but both Firefox and Google Chrome respond with "Unable to connect". Just-in-case changing 192.168.78.0 to 192.168.76.0 didn't help.</p>  <p>Interestingly, inspecting the virtual machine with vagrant ssh shows that "solum is not a recognized command".</p>  <p>B. <a href="http://solum.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install/index.html#for-a-development-installation-use-devstack" rel="nofollow">On Ubuntu</a> - fatal error right by the start (no repository). I can't find a way to fix that line via any config files.</p>  <pre><code>user@user:~/Inzynierka/solum/contrib/devstack$ sh setup_devstack.sh Checking for Docker Getting Solum Code Cloning into '/home/user/solum'... remote: Counting objects: 11080, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5272/5272), done. remote: Total 11080 (delta 7927), reused 8395 (delta 5518) Receiving objects: 100% (11080/11080), 1.64 MiB | 1.59 MiB/s, done.

Installing the development environment (from solum's readthedocs dot org - can't post link because of two-link limit for users with less than 10 reputation). Once again:</p>  <pre><code>fatal: remote error: access denied or repository not exported: /stackforge/solum </code></pre>  <p>D. Installing solum separately on devstack - I can install devstack with no problem, but I have no idea what to do after that. All the documentation says about it: (again from solum's readthedocs dot org - two-link limit)</p>  <pre><code> TODO add docs here on how to install on different distros like:       debian      redhat      suse      ubuntu </code></pre>  <p>Am I doing something wrong? At this point I'm starting to wonder if Solum has been discontinued or if it's not ready for use yet.</p>
