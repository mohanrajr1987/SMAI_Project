<p>I've currently got a base "tabs" Ionic / Angular application.</p>  <p><code>ionic start testproject tabs</code></p>  <p>I've gone ahead and done an <code>npm install</code> to get some of the basic node modules in the project directory.</p>  <p>I'm a little confused about how to use Angular and Express together, and how to set up the node / server end of things. I've tried looking at a bunch of tutorials, and find myself getting a little lost in the mix, so I'm hoping someone will have some resources that might help push me in the right direction.</p>  <p>Because Angular and Express both do MVC / MV* -- It's starting to get really confusing as to what does what. I'm confused on <strong>setup</strong> and how to get them to talk together.</p>  <p>Please let me know what other information I can give, as I'm not sure what else. (The project is pretty bare bones.)</p>  <p>Thank you so much!</p>
