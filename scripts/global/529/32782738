<p>I am new to R. I have just installed R 3.2.2, and RStudio 0.99, under Windows 8.</p>  <p>As per section <strong>3.2 Testing an Installation</strong> of <em>Help contents</em>,  I meant to execute the following 5 lines of commands.</p>  <pre><code>Sys.setenv(LC_COLLATE = "C", LANGUAGE = "en") library("tools") testInstalledBasic("both") testInstalledPackages(scope = "base", errorsAreFatal = FALSE) testInstalledPackages(scope = "recommended", errorsAreFatal = FALSE) </code></pre>  <p>The first 2 worked fine. The third threw an error, as shown here</p>  <pre><code>&gt; Sys.setenv(LC_COLLATE = "C", LANGUAGE = "en") &gt; library("tools") &gt; testInstalledBasic("both") running strict specific tests   running code in ‘eval-etc.R’ unable to open output file FAILED [1] 1 Warning message: running command '"C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-32~1.2/bin/x64/R" CMD BATCH --vanilla --no-timing "eval-etc.R" "eval-etc.Rout"' had status 2  &gt;  </code></pre>  <p>What is the problem? Could it be related to setting directories/permissions?</p>
