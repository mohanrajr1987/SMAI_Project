<p>We have SQL Server 2012 and VS2010 Pro installed which we use for SSIS/RS/AS jobs. I have installed Vs2013 Pro alongside this as we need to use it for MVC 5 development. Everything is working fine. I cannot create any new SSIS jobs in VS2013 and any existing jobs automatically open in VS2010.  However our DBA has found out we have installed VS2013 and is concerned it will have overwritten some SQL server components and wants us to uninstall it and stick to older version. I can find no problems using both of them. </p>  <p>Is it fine to be able to use them both? He asked if I selected install SQL Server components when I installed it but I honestly don't remember. I used defaults. He was concerned if we tried to open old SSIS jobs in VS2013 it would try and upgrade them but it doesn't even let me, it just says incompatible.  I need to convince him there are no issues with having them both-if this is the case. MAny thanks</p>
