<p>I have created app with today and watch kit extension. App build successfully and created IPA. This IPA is also install in device using iTune sync. but when I upload this IPA to diawi and download in device it did not download. Also I have notice that diawi show wrong bundle identifer. I have used Identifer as below </p>  <ul> <li>For iOS app <strong>com.appname.ios</strong></li> <li>For Widget extension <strong>com.appname.widget</strong></li> <li>For Watchkit extension <strong>com.appname.watchkit</strong></li> </ul>  <p>As my app is using <strong>com.appname.ios</strong> identifier but diawi is showing <strong>com.appname.watchkit</strong>. I don't know why this happen. but because of this issue I am not able to install app in device from Diawi </p>
