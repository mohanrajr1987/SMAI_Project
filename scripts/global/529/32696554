<p>So, I have worked with wordpress 3 or 4 times and last time I had a problem opening install.php it was due to me not knowing how to work with "wamp-server".</p>  <p>Today I was going to start a new project but it´s not working properly. </p>  <p>I have set-up wp-config.php and tried to open wp-admin/install.php but all it does is showing the code from install.php.</p>  <p>I am working with wamp this time again, had some trouble starting it due to Skype using port80, but fixed that.</p>  <p>I have, since friday, uppgraded my computer to windows 10. I´m hoping thats not the problem but at the same time dreading that it is..</p>  <p>Hope someone can give me a hand. I'm not an expert at all. I am from sweden, but  everything on my computer is in english so that shouldn't be a problem.</p>
