<p>I'm having trouble installing WordPress on my localhost development area. Everything is working fine, but when I want to move my site to an online environment problems are showing up with the DB collation.</p>  <p>I read about this and it seems that WordPress created tables on my localhost using the utf8mb4_unicode_ci charset/collation. Although my online environment has an higher version of mysql running, it won't import the tables when moving.</p>  <p>I decided to force WordPress to use an older db collation on my localhost. So I changed wp-config to this, before running the setup:</p>  <pre><code>/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */ define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');  /** The Database Collate type. Don't change this if in doubt. */ define('DB_COLLATE', 'utf8_general_ci'); </code></pre>  <p>I saved it and ran the setup. A quick check in the database resulted in tables still in utf8mb4_unicode_ci collation!</p>  <p>How to force WordPress to use the utf8_general_ci collation?</p>
