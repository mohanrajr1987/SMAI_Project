<p>I know it may seem like this is a duplicate, like for instance <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20516271/install-visual-studio-2013-on-windows-7">of this question</a>. But not exactly.</p>  <p>I'm trying to install <strong>VS Express 2013 for Windows Desktop</strong> on Windows 7 (not pro). According to the link above this version of VS Express 2013 is compatible with Windows 7. And I managed to install Visual Studio 2015 Community on the same computer so I don't see why it shouldn't work (why I want VS 2013 when I have 2015 is a long story that doesn't really matter).</p>  <p>Anyway when I download the link from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/fr-fr/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> and launch it this page appears and everything seems fine but when I click the Install Button nothing happens.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Qpnu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Qpnu.png" alt="The problem"></a></p>  <p>I know they say I "may need to free some space" but on G:\ I've still got 50 Go free and according to them the weight max of that version of VS is 6 Go.</p>  <p>What do you think might be the cause of this problem?</p>
