<p>Iam relative new to C# &amp; WPF, I was just started to dive into WPF and I like to use mvvmlight as my framework. And Iam learning with a tutorial wich uses version 4.x (I want to use 5.x).</p>  <p>But after installing, I ain't get any templates for it, but I get the snippets. I used the extension manager of VS2015 to install it. Also I tried to reinstall it with the codeplex version, none have me the templates I wanted.</p>  <p>I can use NuGet to install it on my solution, which gives me at least the basic solution to work with, but sadly that's only a work around.</p>  <p>Iam using Windows 7 64bit and VS2015 community edition.</p>  <p>Hopefully someone can help me out!</p>  <p>Regards Syli</p>
