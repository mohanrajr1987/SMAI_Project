<p>I am trying to install ubuntu 14.04 on an Acer Aspire V 11. The installation completes but on restarting it says 'No bootable system' However when I inspect the hard disc using the live disc it shows all the ubuntu files are there. If I try a reinstall, it tells me that 14.04 is installed.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can get the system to boot using the live disc?</p>  <p>Or any other solution, I have downloaded three different iso's and tried them</p>
