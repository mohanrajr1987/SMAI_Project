<p>I just followed the directions <a href="http://docs.asp.net/en/beta5/getting-started/installing-on-mac.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for installing .NET on my mac (Yosemite 10.10) and now every time I do anything in my terminal I am spammed with this error:</p>  <pre><code>sh: dnvm: line 125: syntax error near unexpected token `&lt;' sh: dnvm: line 125: ` read versionOrAlias downloadUrl &lt; &lt;(__dnvm_find_latest "$runtime" "$arch" "$os");' sh: error importing function definition for `dnvm' sh: dnvm: line 125: syntax error near unexpected token `&lt;' sh: dnvm: line 125: ` read versionOrAlias downloadUrl &lt; &lt;(__dnvm_find_latest "$runtime" "$arch" "$os");' sh: error importing function definition for `dnvm' </code></pre>  <p>I've tried searching for solutions, but nothing came up. I even tried uninstalling it so the errors would go away, but I'm having no luck.</p>  <p>Could someone please tell me how to fix this? Thank you.</p>
