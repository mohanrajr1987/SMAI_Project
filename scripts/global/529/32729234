<p>I am working on a project with the Beaglebone Black and ran into an issue. As part of my project, I would like to use OpenBTS to communicate over the GSM network. However, because the Beaglebone is ARM based, the Transceiver52M that ships with OpenBTS is unusable. Therefore, I need to install an ARM friendly transceiver. The transceiver that I think will do best is Osmo-Trx.</p>  <p>I followed the instructions on their website:  <a href="http://openbsc.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/OsmoTRX" rel="nofollow">http://openbsc.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/OsmoTRX</a></p>  <p>However, when it came to making the project, got an error and am really stuck. When I do the command "make" after "./configure --with-neon", I get the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>make: ***No rule to make target '/Makefile.common', needed by 'Makefile.in'. Stop.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Would anyone be able to help me fix this. I've search around and can't find any applicable answers. I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much in advance!</p>  <p>P.S. All the source code for the OsmoTRX can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/osmocom/osmo-trx" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/osmocom/osmo-trx</a></p>
