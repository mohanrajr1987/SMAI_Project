<blockquote>   <p>Time formatting, strtotime, php Date ()</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am trying to insert "DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm", into the database using strtotime from an input value.</p>  <p>When I retrieved the value using php date(d-m-Y H:i), i am about 7-9 hrs behind....I am guess it s a timezone thing, but the server and me are in the same zone (i think).</p>  <p>How can I make the value stored the same as the value coming out? this is for a date display format.</p>  <p>EDIT: removing strtotime now gives me 01-01-1970 00:00....so whats the problem? isnt the "-" supposed to be euro format?</p>
