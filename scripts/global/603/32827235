<p>I have a time field in my mysql database table which needs to be displayed in one of the spago BI reports. But the values in that time field are like 24:00 ,100:00,120:00. All these are in the hours format. Now my BI query fails when we have case more than 24:00 in that time field as it does not understand the hours being more than 24 hrs. Is it a spago bug or something I am doing is wrong ?</p>  <p>Note: I cannot change or alter the table in any case. </p>
