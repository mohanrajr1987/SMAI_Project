<p>I have a process that I want to log how long it took. I currently view the <code>time</code> output which looks like:</p>  <pre><code>$ time ls  real    0m0.003s user    0m0.002s sys     0m0.001s </code></pre>  <p>I want to capture the elapsed time (the "real" entry) and record it in a database (or text file, or whatever), but I don't know how to do that without also redirecting the standard error output of the command being timed, which I want to avoid.</p>
