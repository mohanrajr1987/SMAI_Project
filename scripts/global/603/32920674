<p>I have a collection of shops, with opening hours, and want to know which of them are currently open. </p>  <p>The problem is that the shops are located all over the world.</p>  <p>This is what the find query looks like: </p>  <pre><code>db.shops.find({'$and': [  {openHours.&lt;day_of_week&gt;.openTime: {$lt: &lt;now_time&gt;}},  {openHours.&lt;day_of_week&gt;.closeTime: {$gt: &lt;now_time&gt;}} ]}); </code></pre>  <p>When I store working time in local time I can't search because of timezones.</p>  <p>When I store working time in UTC I can't search because of summer/winter time switching.  </p>  <p>Update for chridam.</p>  <p>Some sample documents:</p>  <pre><code>[   {name: 'shop1', openHours: {     monday: {openTime:'09:00', closeTime: '18:00'},      tuesday: {openTime:'09:00', closeTime: '18:00'}   }},    {name: 'shop2', openHours: {     monday: {openTime:'10:00', closeTime: '19:00'},     tuesday: {openTime:'10:00', closeTime: '19:00'}   }} ] </code></pre>  <p>query (now it is monday 09:30):</p>  <pre><code>db.shops.find({'$and': [  {openHours.monday.openTime: {$lt: '09:30'}},  {openHours.monday.closeTime: {$gt: '09:30'}} ]}, {name:1}); </code></pre>  <p>result:</p>  <pre><code>[{'name': 'shop1'}] </code></pre>
