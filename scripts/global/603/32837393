<p>I am having an issue where my BISO date and time combination are lost, and my device believes that it is 01/01/70.  This isn't such a big issue - I can sync the clock at a later stage.</p>  <p>If I try to run a basic "Hello World" shell script, created today, the script stubbornly refuses to execute as the creation timestamp is much newer than the current time of the system.</p>  <ul> <li>Question 1 - is there a way to force execute the shell script to ignore the date and times?</li> <li>Question 2 - Any ideas why the BIOS would loose its knowledge of the date and time?</li> </ul>  <p>Let me know if I can provide any more information.</p>
