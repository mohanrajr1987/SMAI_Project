<p>I am attempting to make a simple Morse code translator. I can calculate how long the user has held down a button in order to make a dot or a dash but i am having trouble calculating the time that has elapsed since the user has released the button - the time elapsed will allow me to figure out if it is a new letter/word by timing the space between symbols.</p>  <pre><code> public void btnPressed(View view)    {         button.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {         @Override         public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {              if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {                  lastDown = System.currentTimeMillis();              } else if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_UP) {                  lastDuration = System.currentTimeMillis() - lastDown;                  //Timer starts when the button is released.                 start = System.currentTimeMillis();              }             return false;         }     });      //This is where attempt to calculate the elapsed time.     stop = System.currentTimeMillis() - start; </code></pre>  <p>It does return a time - the problem is that the elapsed time is only a few milliseconds long. Is there a simpler way to go about this?</p>
