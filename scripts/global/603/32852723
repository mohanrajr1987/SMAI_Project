<p>First, thanks for reading this post. </p>  <p>I am trying to force participants to read several pictures for 30 seconds each. For some specific pictures, participants are asked to press "K." I wonder how I can record if participants correctly press "K" for the assigned pictures and mistakenly press "K" while seeing those unassigned pictures.  </p>  <p>I used the two lines to remove the previous/next page buttons. Participants can automatically advance to the next screen after 30 seconds. </p>  <pre><code>this.hideNextButton(); this.hidePreviousButton(); </code></pre>  <p>I also tried to used the below function and send 30 seconds to delay submit. However, this code does not work. </p>  <pre><code>this.hideNextButton(); this.hidePreviousButton();  var that = this;  Event.observe(document, 'keydown', function keydownCallback(e) { var choiceID = null; switch (e.keyCode) { case 74: // 'j' was pressed   choiceID = 1;   break; case 75: // 'k' was pressed   choiceID = 2;   break; }  if (choiceID) { Event.stopObserving(document, 'keydown', keydownCallback); that.setChoiceValue(choiceID, true); that.clickNextButton(); } }); </code></pre>  <p>Thank you again!</p>
