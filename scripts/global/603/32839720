<p>I am just learning R and have come up against this.</p>  <p>I have the below time series observations, </p>  <pre><code>10/08/2015 02:31:04.450 </code></pre>  <ul> <li>I want to split the date and the time to separate columns.</li> <li>Do i need need to round the Milliseconds in time? if so how.</li> </ul>  <p>I have been looking at, <code>data table</code>, <code>lubridate</code> to try and figure it out. I looked at <code>XTS</code> but that seems to be more orientated to aggregation of dates. </p>  <p>Are they any existing packages in R that allows for this splitting? and what sort of argument would I use.</p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated. </p>
