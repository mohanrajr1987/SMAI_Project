<p>I wanted to show remaining time during an installation like in the following question and used the code from there, posted by TLama: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20092779/how-to-show-percent-done-elapsed-time-and-estimated-time-progress">How to show percent done, elapsed time and estimated time progress?</a></p>  <p>The code is working for me, so thanks for this. But if you install bigger files, the period in which the "remaining-time-label" is updated, is too fast.</p>  <p>So I wanted to ask, how to change the update period of the "remaining-time-label", so that it updates only every second or every half second.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
