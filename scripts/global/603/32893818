<p>I have set a time using the hh:mm:ss format in the variable a and set whatever the current time is in the variable in x, same format. And in a if statement if the current time is less then the set time i want it to outprint how many hh:mm:ss it will take to get to the set a  value. Thanks</p>  <pre><code>a.setHours(7); a.setMinutes(45); a.setSeconds(00); currenttime.format(x); if (x.compareTo(a)&lt;0); //x is current time (hh:mm:ss) {     //how do you outprint difference between x and a    System.out.print("You have event in: " x); } if (x.compareTo(a)&gt;0 &amp;&amp; x.compareTo(a1)&lt;0) { } </code></pre>
