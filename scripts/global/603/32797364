<p>How would i add minutes to a date/time stamp dependant on time of day. Pretty simple to add minutes to a date stamp but I am working on a ticket issuing android app, where tickets will expire depending on what tariff they are running</p>  <p>say I have a clock from a api call that is "free*480*add*600*free*360", this is based on a 24hour clock  running from 0000-0000</p>  <p>free*480*add*600*free*360 -</p>  <p>if triggered between 0000-0800 added time starts at 0800</p>  <p>if triggered between 0800-1800 add time to current time, if time goes past 1800 extra time starts at 0800</p>  <p>if triggered between 1800-2359 added time starts at 0800</p>  <p>also a block function,</p>  <p>"block*420*free*60*add*600*block*360" - all times end at 1800, and cannot be triggered until 0700, which start at 0800</p>
