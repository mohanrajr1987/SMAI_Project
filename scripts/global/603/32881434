<p>i am developing a module in php where i am supposed to manage time differences and proceed at a specific time difference.  i am fetching a value from database ($end_date) which contains time. </p>  <pre><code>$end_date = $result['end_date']; </code></pre>  <p>getting the server time from</p>  <pre><code>$date = $this-&gt;GetServerTime(); </code></pre>  <p>getting the time difference between these two</p>  <pre><code>$diffrence = date("Y-m-d H:i:s",strtotime("$date -  $end_date")); </code></pre>  <p>now, i need to check IF the time difference is less than 15 seconds via if statement. my approach:</p>  <pre><code>$to_time = strtotime("0000-00-00 00:00:15");             if ($difference &lt; $to_time)             {              echo "here";              } </code></pre>  <p>but i believe i am not doing something right, how else should i compare this? i've done a lot of research but to no avail, any help is appreciated. </p>
