<p>I am having trouble understanding what my frequency parameter should be in the following time series:</p>  <p>I have hourly temperature for every day from April to November. To take care of missing data, I averaged the temperature per month at each hour. I have the temperatures of an average day in April, May, etc., for a total of 24 data points per month for 8 months.</p>  <p>Does this require two seasonal periods?</p>  <p>I thought that the frequency parameter should be 24 (for observations per month), but I am not 100% confident. When I plot the ACF of the TS with freq=24, the lags occur at decimal values, which throws me off. However, the graph shows 8 periods, which makes logical sense because there are 8 months. Any help and guidance would be very much appreciated, thank you!</p>
