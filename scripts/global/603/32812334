<p>I am attempting to understand the various high precision timekeeping techniques in Windows, and hooking directly into the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms725473(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">various APIs</a> with C++. </p>  <p>I am aware of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/ms644904(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">QPC</a> and know that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh706895(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime()</a> utilises the same techniques for high precision timestamps. However the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724397(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()</a> API seems to be <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/ms186724.aspx" rel="nofollow">used by SQL Server to get its high precision timestamps</a> (i.e. DATETIME2) which I find odd.</p>  <p><em>Note: A very good resource is the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/dn553408(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">Acquiring high-resolution time stamps</a> msdn article (although it is probably more of a "paper").</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh706895(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime()</a> The   GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime function retrieves the current system   date and time with the highest possible level of precision (&lt;1us). The   retrieved information is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format.</p> </blockquote>  <p>My issue is that the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724950(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">SYSTEMTIME structure</a> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Specifies a date and time, using individual members for the <strong>month, day, year, weekday, hour, minute, second, and millisecond.</strong> The time is either in coordinated universal time (UTC) or local time, depending on the function that is being called.</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>typedef struct _SYSTEMTIME {   WORD wYear;   WORD wMonth;   WORD wDayOfWeek;   WORD wDay;   WORD wHour;   WORD wMinute;   WORD wSecond;   WORD wMilliseconds; } SYSTEMTIME, *PSYSTEMTIME; </code></pre>  <p>only seems to have millisecond precision, the documentation for this structure comments on the wMilliseconds part of the structure:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>wMilliseconds</strong>   The millisecond. The valid values for this member are 0 through 999.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I wish to convert a high-precision FILETIME to some kind of SYSTEMTIME structure, how can I keep the extra precision? Implementing a custom conversion from the FILETIME type seems a big undertaking? </p>
