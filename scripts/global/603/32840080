<p>trying to compare user defined time in format HH:MM with current time in an infinite loop. When they are equal, some action should occur.</p>  <p>I have used following code:</p>  <pre><code>//taking user input DateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("hh:mm"); String time = jFormattedTextField1.getText(); userTime = sdf.parse(time);  //taking current time Date timeNow = new Date(); while (true){     if (timeNow.equals(userTime)){     System.out.println("The time equals, task is done!");     ChangingWindow window = new ChangingWindow(chosenColor); </code></pre>  <p>When I print these 2 time points I recieve the following:</p>  <p>User time: Thu Jan 01 10:35:00 CET 1970</p>  <p>Current time: Tue Sep 29 10:33:21 CEST 2015</p>  <p>Current time is obviously ok but for user defined time he keeps returning epoch. If anybody has any suggestion I would be grateful!</p>
