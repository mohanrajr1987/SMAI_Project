<p>I am using codeigniter, in this I need to get daily sales details with date wise. I have given MySQL query statement, in this i need to take values based on the everyday 15:00:00 to next day morning 06:00:00 is one day result. ie, today date is 29-9-2015, for this result need to come with 29-9-2015 15:00:00 to 30-9-2015 06:00:00. I have tried in so many ways, below i have given my query. It is working only based on the daily hours 15:00:00 to 24:00:00 only. if i give 06 instead of 24 means it will not working. Because the 06 is next day hours. I don't know how to +1 the day with hours in MySQL.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT DATE_FORMAT( date, '%e' ) AS date, SUM( COALESCE( total_tax, 0 ) ) AS tax1, SUM( COALESCE( total_tax2, 0 ) ) AS tax2, SUM( COALESCE( total, 0 ) ) AS total, SUM( COALESCE( inv_discount, 0 ) ) AS discount, SUM( COALESCE( cash_amt, 0 ) ) AS cash, SUM( COALESCE( master_amt, 0 ) ) AS master, SUM( COALESCE( visa_amt, 0 ) ) AS visa, SUM( COALESCE( nets_amt, 0 ) ) AS nets, SUM( COALESCE( coupon_amt, 0 ) ) AS coupon, SUM( COALESCE( paid, 0 ) ) AS paid FROM sales WHERE (DATE_FORMAT( date, '%Y-%m' ) = '2015-09') AND (DELETE_STATUS != 'Deleted') AND DATE_FORMAT( DATETIME, '%H' ) BETWEEN '15' AND '24' GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT( DATETIME, '%e' ); </code></pre>  <p>And I have attached my output screenshot with the result of 15 to 24 hours. I think you got my question.
