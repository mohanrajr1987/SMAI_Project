<p>I want to parse date and time. I want to catch if there is a format exception and I do the following:</p>  <pre><code>    try     {         DateTime time = DateTime.Parse(Console.ReadLine());     }     catch (FormatException)     {         Console.WriteLine("Wrong date and time format!");     } </code></pre>  <p>However when I start working with the value 'time' C# says that "The name 'time' does not exist in the current context". Where is my mistake?</p>
