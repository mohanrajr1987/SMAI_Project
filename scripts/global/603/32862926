<p>I have a delivery time window from 01:40 to 2:10 every day. That's a LocalTime In UK we have daylight savings time and if I use</p>  <pre><code>ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDate(2015, 3, 29), LocalTime.of(1, 40), ZoneId.of("Europe/London")) </code></pre>  <p>I get 02:40 on the day in question because the switch to daylight savings causes a gap. But then I end up with a negative delivery time window of 2:40 - 2:10 on the day in question. I guess I can detect this by converting back to LocalTime to see if my hours have stayed the same, but is there a smarter way of spotting my local to zoned datetime conversion has fallen "in the gap"?</p>  <p>And if I have fallen in the gap how do I find out what the gap actually is - in this case 1:00 - 2:00</p>
