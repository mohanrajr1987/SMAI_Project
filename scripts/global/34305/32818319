<p>I have a batch statement which I am going to execute via <code>sp_executesql</code> or <code>Exec</code>:</p>  <pre><code>Declare @query1 varchar(max), @query2  varchar(max) Set @query1 = '  select top 10 * from sysobjects; select top 10 * from sysColumns;'  Set @query2 = ' select top 10 * from sysobjects select top 10 * from sysColumns select top 10 * from sysColumns '  Exec(@query1)  Exec(@query2) </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way by which I can know how many select/insert/update/delete statements or queries are there in a single batch ?</p>  <p>For above Eg; the answer is 2 &amp; 3 respectively</p>  <p><strong>For clarity :</strong> I do not decide the batch statements, it directly comes to me via a stored procedure parameter.</p>  <p>I just need to know how many queries is the server executing in this batch.</p>
