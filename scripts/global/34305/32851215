<p>I have a list of Matter data in <strong>Table1</strong> that I need to query, as well as get the <strong>most recent</strong> Invoice Number in <strong>Table2</strong> that is tied to the original Matter. I'm having extreme difficulty in joining these tables together and only getting one result for each Matter as I only want the most recent Invoice #.</p>  <p>Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.   </p>  <p><strong>Table1</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DdlIx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DdlIx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>Table2</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RYZYp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RYZYp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>RESULT</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lDgPR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lDgPR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
