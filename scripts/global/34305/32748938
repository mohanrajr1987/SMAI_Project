<p>I have an interesting problem for the smart people out there. I have an external application I cannot modify writing pictures into a SQL Server table. The pictures are often non-unique, but linked to unique rows in other tables.</p>  <p>The table <code>MyPictures</code> looks like this (simplified):  </p>  <pre><code>Unique (ID)     FileName (Varchar)     Picture (Varbinary)   ---------------------------------------------------------- xxx-xx-xxx1     MyPicture              0x66666666   xxx-xx-xxx2     MyPicture              0x66666666   xxx-xx-xxx3     MyPicture              0x66666666   </code></pre>  <p>This causes the same data to be stored over and over again, blowing up my database (85% of my DB is just this table).</p>  <p>Is there something on a SQL level I can do to only store the data once if filename &amp; picture already exists in my table? </p>
