<p>I have the following two columns:</p>  <pre><code>date (datetime), month_after_release (int) </code></pre>  <p>These columns are filled monthly as part of an <code>incremental update</code>.</p>  <p>Let's say there was a release on Jan 1, 2015. This means we are currently in the 9th month after release <code>[formula: round off((current date - release date)/30,0)+1 = 9]</code> . So if I am now importing data with a current date (Sep 21, 2015), the two columns should be filled like this:</p>  <pre><code>date = 2015-09-21 00:00:00.000 month_after_release = 9 </code></pre>  <p>In October, data which gets imported should then get the following information:</p>  <pre><code>date = 2015-10-21 00:00:00.000 month_after_release = 10 </code></pre>  <p>How can I achieve this? One possibility which came to my mind would be to have a separate mapping table, which maps every single date to "month_after_release", but I was wondering if there is a better possibility?</p>  <p>The information when a release was is stored in a separate table, which looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>ReleaseID, Release_start_date </code></pre>
