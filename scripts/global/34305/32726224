<p>I have a query that I am trying to use in a reporting services tool, and I want to change the query to allow multiple values of the users choice to be inserted into the variables <code>@writtenby</code> &amp; <code>@sellinglocation</code>. However the <code>LIKE</code> operator is preceding where I would normally <code>IN</code> to simply allow that. Is there a way to make this happen? </p>  <pre><code>Declare @writtenby varchar(20)  if @writtenby is null or len(rtrim(@writtenby)) = 0     set @writtenby = '%'  Declare @sellinglocation varchar(6)  if @sellinglocation is null or len(rtrim(@sellinglocation)) = 0     set @sellinglocation = '%'  Select      so.sonumber, so.customerpo, so.customershipto, cst.name,      so.quotenumber, so.type, so.dateadded, so.acktoname, so.writtenby,      so.sellinglocation,vw.totalvalue From       tblsoso so, tblarcustomershipto cst, vwsoSOTotalvalue vw where      vw.sonumber = so.sonumber      and so.status = 'Open'     and cst.customershipto = so.customershipto      and so.writtenby like @writtenby      and so.sellinglocation like @sellinglocation </code></pre>
