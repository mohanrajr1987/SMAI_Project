<p>A database contains in its definition some hardcoded literal, which should be replaced by a generic function call. </p>  <p>The literal may appear in procedures, triggers, defaults, checks, etc. - basically "everywhere".  </p>  <p>I'm using this code to find the literal:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT Name FROM sys.objects  WHERE OBJECT_DEFINITION(OBJECT_ID) LIKE '%HARDCODEDLITERAL%' </code></pre>  <p>I just would like to know if this code is sufficient to find all occurrences, or if I might be overseeing some occurrences within the database ?</p>
