<p>Little weird requirement, but here it goes. We have a <code>CustomerId VarChar(25)</code> column in a table. We need to make it <code>NVarChar(25)</code> to work around issues with type conversions.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32788227/charindex-vs-like-search-gives-very-different-performance-why">CHARINDEX vs LIKE search gives very different performance, why?</a></p>  <p>But, we don't want to allow non-latin characters to be stored in this column. Is there any way to place such a constraint on column? I'd rather let database handle this check. In general we OK with <code>NVarChar</code> for all of our strings, but some columns like ID's is not a good candidates for this because of possibility of look alike strings from different languages</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>CustomerId NVarChar(1) - PK </code></pre>  <ul> <li>Value 1: BOPOH</li> <li>Value 2: ВОРОН</li> </ul>  <p>Those 2 strings different (second one is Cyrillic)</p>  <p>I want to prevent this entry scenario. I want to make sure Value 2 can not be saved into the field.</p>
