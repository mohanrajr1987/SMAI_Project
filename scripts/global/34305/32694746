<p>I've a table like this</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/55dm5.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/55dm5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've another table <code>sections</code> in which there are 6 sections with id from <code>1 to 6</code>. I get a list of section id from user which gives information about the current active section of user. Suppose the list returned to me has section ids as follows <code>{2,3,4,5}</code> for user with id <code>1</code>. Now my question is </p>  <ol> <li>How can I pass this list of section ids to my stored procedure</li> <li>I want to update is active flag of record where section id is 1 and user id is 1  since the list of section ids doesn't have an entry of 1</li> <li>I want to insert a new record of section id 5 for user id 1 in same table as it is returned in list of section ids.</li> </ol>  <p>Can anyone please tell me how to achieve this?</p>  <p>I can get <code>total section id's</code> from the following query</p>  <pre><code>select Id from sections </code></pre>  <p>but don't know i will iterate between <code>total list of section id's</code> and compare the <code>list of section ids</code> returned from C# </p>
