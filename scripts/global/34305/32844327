<p>I am trying to insert data into a temp table by joining other two tables but for some reason, i keep getting this error <code>String or Binary data would be truncated</code>.</p>  <p>On debugging, I realized there are no rows being inserted into the table and it still throws an error.</p>  <p>To get rid of this, I had finally used <code>SET ANSI_WARNINGS OFF</code> inside the stored procedure and it worked fine. Now the issue is I cannot recompile the stored procedure with this settings in the production database and I want this issue to be fixed. And the other thing which is more irritating is, by default the <code>ANSI_WARNINGS</code> are actually <code>OFF</code> for the database.</p>  <p>Please let me know what could be the possible solution. It would be of great help.</p>
