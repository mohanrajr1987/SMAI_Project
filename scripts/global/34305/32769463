<p>My current query is below:</p>  <pre><code> SELECT [id]        ,[reqFacility]        ,[reqAccount]        ,[reqAccType]        ,[reqAccBal]        ,[reqPatName]        ,[reqPatMRN]        ,[reqType]        ,[reqBox]        ,[reqOwner]        ,[reqDate]        ,[flag]        ,[flagDate]        ,[flagNotes]        ,[flagUser]        ,[reqId]  FROM [stingRay].[dbo].[requests]  WHERE DATEDIFF(DD,reqDate,GETDATE()) &lt;= 3 </code></pre>  <p>When there is an instance of flag=D in the last 3 days, I would like to pull all instances in the table (also in the same time frame) having the same 'reqaccount' as any account in flag D.  Essentially, I want to link based on 'reqaccount' and only pull accounts that had a D at some point in my time frame. Any help on the matter is much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
