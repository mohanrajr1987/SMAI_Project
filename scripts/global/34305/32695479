<p>I've been using Management Studio with no problems on my current machine for just about two years, and successfully migrated to Windows 10 a few weeks back. Last week it started hanging on open with the following error: </p>  <pre><code>Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.RegisteredServers.RegisteredServerException:  Unable to read the list of previously registered servers on this system.  Re-register your servers in the 'Registered Servers' window. </code></pre>  <p>After doing some research, I managed to get around this by following the advice found in <a href="http://blog.sqltechie.com/2011/01/problem-in-opening-registered-servers.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a>, but now the object explorer refuses to expand. The program acts for all the world as if it is not responding, but eventually I'll get the following error:</p>  <p>Value cannot be null. Parameter name: viewInfo (Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.SqlStudio.Explorer)</p>  <p>After that, I can open a new query window and everything responds, but I cannot use the object explorer. I've looked at <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/7e0287b3-cd37-408e-8145-4b9dba8c7811/value-cannot-be-null-in-2008-r2-ssms-studio-package-failed-to-load?forum=sqltools" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, but it doesn't seem to solve anything for me. </p>  <p>Is there <strong>ANY</strong> chance I don't have to reinstall SSMS?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Attempted to just reinstall, but failed with the error <code>"The specified account already exists"</code>.</p>
