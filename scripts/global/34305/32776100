<p>I'm developing a C# web application which has lots of SQL Server interactions in the page for CRUD operations, using stored procedures which causes the application to slow down. I want to analyse all the SQL statements executed on the current page to find which procedure requires modification.</p>  <p>For ex. <strong>Execution time, Data count, parameters, etc</strong> passed to the stored procedure, so I'm thinking of running <code>sqlProfiler.aspx</code> page along with the current application page so that whatever SQL query runs on this page has to be listed in the <code>sqlprofiler.aspx</code> (which will be executed simultaneously after execution of <code>Current.aspx</code>).</p>  <p>so that I don't need to switch frequently to Management Studio for SQL Server Profiler to check all the statements.</p>
