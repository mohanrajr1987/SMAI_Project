<p>I'm not a full-stacker, so forgive me in advance.</p>  <p>I'm trying to connect to a SQL Server 2008 R2 database from a Linux based server (via PHP mssql_connect). I am unable to do so.</p>  <p>The Error we get is:  Connection timed out.</p>  <p>We are able to successfully connect to the SQL Server 2008 r2 from a Windows based server using sqlrv.</p>  <p>I'm able to successfully connect to a SQL Server 2012 database (hosted on Arvixe).</p>  <p>We have FreeTDS installed on our server. The <code>mssql</code> module installed and the database credentials added to our freetds.conf -- but still unable to connect.</p>  <p><strong>We've also been whitelisted to access the database.</strong></p>  <p>Is there anything we are missing? Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>
