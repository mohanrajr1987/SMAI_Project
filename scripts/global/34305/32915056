<p>I typically use server side tracing to get information about activity happening on several of my sql servers but when I discovered the Auditing feature I was thrilled that I could setup an audit so easy.  then I discovered the one piece of information I need is missing from the log, the hostname that sent the query to the database.  this completely renders auditing useless for me because I need to answer that question "who did this?" and without that info I am the one who gets the blame.  Is there any way to turn this field on?  Am I just stuck using icky server side traces forever?</p>
