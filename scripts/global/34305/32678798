<p>I'm trying to get a full picture of views refernces in my DB. In other words, I want to know for each field in each view - where it is getting its data from.</p>  <p>I know I can get the objects referenced by a view using:  <code>FROM sys.dm_sql_referenced_entities ('[object name]', 'OBJECT');</code>.</p>  <p>Is there a way to find which field in the referencing object referenced which field in the referenced object?</p>
