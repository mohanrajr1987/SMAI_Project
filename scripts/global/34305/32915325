<p>So I'm doing some performance comparison between SSD and HDD for SQL Server insert statements.</p>  <p>I'm inserting 2,000 columns worth of data across 4 different tables.</p>  <p>For each record I insert 1 row in each table.</p>  <p>I tested on one machine with a SSD as the main hard drive running the SQL Server process and the database file itself on a secondary HDD drive.</p>  <p>I tested on another machine with just a SSD drive that has both the SQL Server process and the actual DB file.</p>  <p>I would have expected the machine with the database field on the HDD to be slower than the machine with everything on the SSD.</p>  <p>Is this behavior I'm seeing expected? If so why?</p>
