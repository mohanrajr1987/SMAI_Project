<p>We're trying to test loading data from our on-premise SQL Server 2008R2 machine to ParaSQL using SymmetricDS. We have a dedicated server instance with ParaSQL which requires an SSL connection. Certificates are provided by ParaSQL.</p>  <p>Where we're stuck is how to configure SymmetricDS to use secure socket layer for this connection. We can find some info in the documentation on how to generate keys on our end, but nothing on how to connect using provided certificates.</p>  <p>Does anyone here have any experience with that?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
