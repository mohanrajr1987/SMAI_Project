<p>I have to create a console application that will fetch data from a database and insert data into another database. On user input in console I want to create the database on the destination server with approximately 70-80 tables.</p>  <p>If I have the table create script, can I create database from C# on user input? If yes please guide me how can we do that.</p>  <p>Any help will be appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>
