<p>I know many people have asked about this error and trust me I've read ALL of them and followed all the steps! But I'm still getting the unresolved external symbol error.</p>  <p>I'm trying to use the dll of lp_solve (a linear programming package) in my c++ code in visual studio 2012. The error message I'm getting is: <strong>Error 80  error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _make_lp@8 referenced in function "void __cdecl my_solve(BLAH BLAH)</strong></p>  <p>The function make_lp() is from the lp_solve package and I'm calling it from my_solve() in my code. This error message pops up for each solver function I call. Seems the linker just couldn't find any of the implementation of these functions.</p>  <p>I've done the following</p>  <ol> <li>put #include "lp_lib.h" in my source code</li> <li>put the .dll, .h and .lib files from the lp_solve package in the working directory and</li> <li>added the path under Linker:General:Additional Library Directories. </li> <li>added the lib under Linker:Input:Additional dependency</li> </ol>  <p>What's wrong?  Thanks for your help!</p>
