<p>My solution consists of four projects, three of which are DLLs.  I can no longer set breakpoints in two of the three DLL projects.  When running the application, I select Debug-Windows-Modules and the two offending modules aren't showing-up in the Module List.</p>  <p>The PDB files are being generated and are located in the correct folders and the application runs properly.  All of my research to date addresses what to do if your symbols aren't being loaded...not if the DLL isn't showing up in the list.</p>  <p>Is there a mechanism in VS2015 to force a project DLL into the Debug Modules List?</p>  <p>Edit: This is a .Net/WPF/C# project.</p>  <p>Paul</p>
