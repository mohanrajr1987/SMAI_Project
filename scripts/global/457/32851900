<p>I am using the following code to load dlls at run time, and store their classes for later use.</p>  <pre><code>public LoadDll(byte[] data) {     Assembly loadedAssembly = Assembly.Load(data);     System.Type[] types = loadedAssembly.GetTypes();     TypeRepo.Register(types); } </code></pre>  <p>and this works great, but if the dll I built has reference to another dll I get the error "The classes in the module cannot be loaded." when calling GetTypes().</p>  <p>How can I provide a specific file path to allow the loaded assembly accesses to a dependency on disk?</p>
