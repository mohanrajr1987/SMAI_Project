<p>I'm using Visual Studio 2013, with the 2012 toolset and I'm trying to split an win32 executable project up into an exe that consumes a dll that contains all the program logic. The end goal is to be able to create a seperate project for unit tests that can link against the new dll.</p>  <p>Now the old version of the project compiles absolutely fine and uses cryptlib.lib (thanks SVN!), but once I separated it out in to a dll with the program logic and the same project settings I get the following error when I attempt to build the dll:</p>  <p>Error   546 error LNK1104: cannot open file 'cryptopp.lib'  </p>  <p>I have the directory that contains cryptlib.lib in my linker settings and I'm linking against it just as I did in the previous project settings. Based on the documentation it shouldn't be trying to link against cryptopp.lib because CRYPTOPP_DEFAULT_NO_DLL is defined in the preprocessor settings.</p>  <p>I also tried adding the directory that contains cryptopp.lib to the VC++ directory paths and I added cryptopp.lib to my linker settings, and it still gives me the same error. I don't want to use the dll version of cryptopp, but at this point I just need the thing to work.</p>  <p>All the projects are using the 2012 toolsets, and all are being compiled as win32 projects so I'm not sure where to go from here.</p>
