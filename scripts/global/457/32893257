<p>I have a solution with 2 projects:</p>  <pre><code>  MainSolution      Project A      Project B        Folder A          Settings.xml (Embedded R.-&gt;Copy Always) </code></pre>  <p>But when I try to deploy it over ClickOnce, I got an error when the app starts, something like: "Could not find the .xml file", so the problem is basically that in the deployment part the file is not copied over the output directory.</p>  <p>I tried to:</p>  <p>*Change the output dir from my project B to the bin\debug in project A *I included my project B as required in the app files for project A in the publish setting of my main project (Project A).</p>  <p>PS: The error is obtained when I tried to retrieve my settings in the fiel, I tried to use: </p>  <p>*Application.StartupPath + "\Folder\Settings.xml *Path.Combine(Directory.GetParent(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()).Parent.Parent.FullName) + "\Project B\Folder\Settings.xml"</p>  <p>Thanks, regards.</p>
