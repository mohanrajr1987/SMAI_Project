<p>I have a native win32 dll which has been built from 3 static libraries using Visual Studio 12 2013.</p>  <p>Two of these static libraries are static 'plugins' which rely on global initialisers to 'register' with the third library.</p>  <p>This means I need code to be executed when the dll is loaded. I have a function:</p>  <pre><code>int NullDevicePlugin_construct() {     inititalise_plugin();     return 0; } int g_NullDevicePlugin_initialiser = NullDevicePlugin_construct(); </code></pre>  <p>This function never gets called. I have checked the symbols in the static lib where this code resides, and I have:</p>  <pre><code>00C 00000000 SECT5  notype       Static       | .CRT$XCU     Section length    4, #relocs    1, #linenums    0, checksum        0 00E 00000000 SECT5  notype       Static       | _g_NullDevicePlugin_initialiser$initializer$ </code></pre>  <p>I have also linked the dll which contains this static lib with /OPT:NOREF and /OPT:NOICF.</p>  <p>This is a mobile cross-development project, and for Android and iOS I use:</p>  <pre><code>__attribute__((constructor)) static void NullDevicePlugin_constructor() </code></pre>  <p>decoration which gets called on both platforms.</p>  <p>I have also tried: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1113409/attribute-constructor-equivalent-in-vc">__attribute__((constructor)) equivalent in VC?</a>, but this does not work for me.</p>  <p>The c# code calls into the native dll with no problems.</p>  <p>Can anyone help with this?</p>  <p>Many thanks</p>
