<p>I'm trying to create a .NET 4.0/4.5.2 console application which will load third party .NET v2.0 dll which is written in VC++.  In app.config I have an entry </p>  <pre><code>&lt;startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true"&gt; &lt;supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5.2"/&gt; &lt;/startup&gt; </code></pre>  <p>If the console app is in Debug mode the third party dll functionality works perfectly. But in release mode or when i open the console.exe directly it will throw error saying</p>  <blockquote>   <p>External Component has thrown an Exception</p> </blockquote>  <p>which I guess the supporting dlls for the .NET v2.0 assembly are not loaded properly. </p>
