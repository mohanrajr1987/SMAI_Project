<p>I want to be able to type www.mydomain.com into my web browser but have the actual traffic go to something.mydomain.com. I thought to, maybe inject a dll into the process browser(firefox.exe). I tried to use some methods like hooking, dll injection using create remote thread etc. But, since I'm a newbie, especially when it comes to C++ or Assembly level languages, I coudn't understand much about it. The one's I could understand are no longer compatible with Win 7 or higherCould someone help me by directing me in the right path.  All I want is know how to intercept/manipulate an outgoing URL request from the browser. I found that TCP/IP first creates some socket using socket() function and then connect() function. I sthere a way to intercept that? I want this to be easy, simple and compatible with windows XP to 10. If it's not easy I'm okay with building different codes for different versions. If the script is cross platform, it would be even more awesome.</p>
