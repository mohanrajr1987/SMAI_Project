<p>I am trying to get a VB.NET DLL used as a reference on a aspx.cs page.</p>  <p>I have added the compiled DLL and it's resources to a bin folder, and I have added the reference and added </p>  <pre><code>using my_DLL; </code></pre>  <p>Then I go to call a function like this....</p>  <pre><code>public string foobar = concat_function_DLL("foo" , "bar");  </code></pre>  <p>but, I get the red sqwiggles under concat_function_DLL (my DLL function) and this message :</p>  <pre><code>"The name 'concat_function_DLL' does not exist in the current context </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>I have tried removing the bin folder, removing the reference, re-creating the bin folder and then re-adding the reference, but it still doesn't want to recognize anything from my DLL.</p>  <p>The DLL will work completely fine from my VB.Net webpage so I know it cannot be a problem with the DLL. Maybe there is some step I am missing? I thought I read that .NET DLLs are interchangeable between both vb.net and c#.net.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
