<p>Assembly A is dynamically generated using reflection, from code located in assembly B which was compiled with Visual Studio. Assembly A is saved as a DLL. Assembly A uses methods from Assembly B.</p>  <p>In Assembly C, I reference both assemblies A and B, but code in A gives errors at runtime about not finding types and methods from B. Assembly C is generated with the CSharp code provider.</p>  <p>I think the solution would be to somehow force Assembly A to load a reference to Assembly B from file before calling any methods or fields from Assembly B, but how to I do that in IL via Reflection.Emit?</p>
