<p>What does "public key" (for a .net assembly) means exactly?</p>  <p>Most of the time people talks about PublicKeyToken (Which is just reference or shortcut key to refer the public key) but nobody talks about public key. Please tell us what is exactly the public key means? What is the purpose of it? And most importantly the difference between public key and strong name? In GAC, why it's not needed to create a strong name for an assembly if a public key(I am assuming it but still did not know) is there.</p>
