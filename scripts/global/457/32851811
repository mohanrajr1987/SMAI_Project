<p>I want to show the clipboard in a textbox as its content changes, I understand that I need to use imports from "user32.dll", but I have never used these kinds of imports and they are a bit confusing for me. I have checked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/621577/clipboard-event-c-sharp">this</a> link and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2226920/how-to-monitor-clipboard-content-changes-in-c">this</a> link to get some ideas about Clipboard change event, so here are my questions: <strong>1. Even though I copied and pasted the codes from the links above, they still don't work:</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KnM5O.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KnM5O.png" alt="error1"></a> WndProc's error is: <em>'object' does not contain a definition for 'WndProc'</em></p>  <p><strong>2. I'd like to know more about the user32.dll and kernel32.dll imports, if possible, please provide some information about them, or provide some sources that explain the basics of these.</strong> Thank you</p>
