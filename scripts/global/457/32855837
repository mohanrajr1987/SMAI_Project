<p>I have written a dll that references Entity Framework version 5. It is also packaged as a NuGet package which has a dependency on Entity Framework >= 5. </p>  <p>When I install this package into another project which already has a reference to Entity Framework 6 there are no complaints about the dependency but it crashes as runtime saying it cannot find the Entity Framework 5 dll.</p>  <p>The reference has <code>SpecificVersion</code> set to false in my dll's project and I have tried adding a <code>bindingRedirect</code> in the web.config of the project which references my dll, but still the error occurs.</p>  <p>Any idea how I can get this to work or what I am missing here?</p>
