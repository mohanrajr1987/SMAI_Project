<p>I am working on interfacing a <code>libUSB</code> operated device with the <code>LabView</code>. I searched on net but found only simple example of <code>loading</code> or <code>importing</code> <code>DLLs</code> but couldn't find any complex example. I have multiple of header files with multiple DLLs dependencies. Also the device work with LibUSB. Is there any way to interface that device with <code>labView</code> using the existing C/C++ code and libraries? </p>
