<p>I've got a problem with my app, when it comes to executing it in compiled .exe form. I am new in this and I don't know where the problem is. I already tried to search this problem on Google &amp; this site but nothing what I found helped me. </p>  <p>I am using Code::Blocks IDE with MinGW and wxWidgets 2.8.X installed. </p>  <p>Everything works fine inside IDE, but when I try to run it as exe - already compiled - I get an error like this:</p>  <pre><code>The program can not start because the computer is missing wxmsw28u_gcc_custom.dll.  Try to solve this problem by reinstalling the program. </code></pre>  <p>When I copy this .dll file right next to my .exe then it will execute without any errors.</p>  <p>Any clues how to fix it ? I guess it's easy to fix but I really don't know how ...</p>
