<p>Anyone know if its possible to gracefully test for and handle a missing .dll file in a Delphi application? For example, my code has this function declaration:</p>  <pre><code>function KFUNC(Arg1, Arg2, Arg3, Arg4: DWord): longint stdcall; external 'KL2DLL32.DLL' name '_KFUNC@16'; </code></pre>  <p>...which of course requires the dll file KL2DLL32.DLL to be found on the system, otherwise my application wont start. Im wondering if theres some different way to code this, so my application could test for the dll file's existence, and then handle accordingly. Obviously, the goal would be have my application still start normally even if the dll file isn't there. Thanks.</p>
