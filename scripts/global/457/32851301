<p>Before i go into detail. If there is a problem with the question. leave a comment stating what the problem is.</p>  <p>I am already able to access the path to the Font file in my dll Resources folder. I just need to pass the data to a Font field . Here is how I access the path and Font data in my dll.</p>  <p>If there is a problem with the question. leave a comment stating what the problem is.</p>  <p>Just to mention , this class exists inside my dll.</p>  <pre><code>class ClassA { public Font myFont; void GetFontDromDLL() {           Assembly myAssembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();                      Stream myStream = myAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream(myAssembly.GetName().Name + ".Resources.Awesomefont.ttf");          //myFontfont = ?  }   } </code></pre>  <p>from that point on how do i assign it to <code>myFont</code></p>  <p>If it is that i first need to create a byte array from <code>myStream</code> then i can do that . I still can't pass it to the Font field <code>myFont</code> , I don't know how</p>  <p>For my project I am unable to use System.Drawing  and anything extending from System.Drawing as I am working in the Unity Engine,  so using <code>System.Drawing.Text.PrivateFontCollection</code> is out of the question.</p>  <p>thanks for any help</p>
