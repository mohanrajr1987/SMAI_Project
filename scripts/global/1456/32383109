<p>I am reading a bit stream from a server.  I can successfully communicate with the server and translate to ASCII or UTF-8. However I need to get it to be readable and not a blob of info.  Any suggestions? </p>  <pre><code>while (true) {     byte[] x = new byte[1];     x[0] = (byte)Console.Read();     s.Send(x);      while (byte &gt; 0)     {         byte[] buffer = new byte[800];          s.Receive(buffer);         Console.Write(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buffer).Trim());     } </code></pre>  <p>Then incoming is a byte stream..  the resulting out put looks like 6.Word word some word >> (a tiny arrow pointing left)9;80H...</p>  <p>I thing the tiny arrow and the 9;80H are for the format and placement of lines and text but not sure. </p>
