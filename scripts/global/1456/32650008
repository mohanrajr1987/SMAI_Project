<p>I am researching licensing solutions for a project of mine, one article has the following text:</p>  <p>"The expiration date is represented as days (not seconds) since 1/1/1970. This way it only takes two bytes to represent the date" - [<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/licensing-using-symmetric-and-asymmetric/184401687?pgno=1][1]" rel="nofollow">http://www.drdobbs.com/licensing-using-symmetric-and-asymmetric/184401687?pgno=1][1]</a> (under the heading "HMAC Licensing System" about half way down)</p>  <p>How can this be correct if the days returned are a 32-bit integer, how can this guy fit that info into 2 bytes?</p>
