<p>A byte consists of 8 bits on most systems.</p>  <p>A byte typically represents the smallest data type a programmer may use. Depending on language, the data types might be called <code>char</code> or <code>byte</code>.</p>  <p>There are some types of data (booleans, small integers, etc) that could be stored in fewer bits than a byte. Yet using less than a byte is not supported by any programming language I know of (natively).</p>  <p>Why does this minimum of using 8 bits to store data exist? Why do we even need bytes? Why don't computers just use increments of bits (1 or more bits) rather than increments of bytes (multiples of 8 bits)?</p>  <p>Just in case anyone asks: I'm not worried about it. I do not have any specific needs. I'm just curious.</p>
