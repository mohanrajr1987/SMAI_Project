<p>This is so far what I've done to convert the 8 bytes I received to UInt64:</p>  <pre><code>+ (UInt64)convertByteArrayToUInt64:(unsigned char *)bytes ofLength:(NSInteger)length {     UInt64 data = 0;      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)     {         data = data | ((UInt64) (bytes[i] &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; (24 - i * 8));     }      return data; } </code></pre>  <p>The sender that converts the data to 8 bytes data did it this way:</p>  <pre><code>for(int i=1;i&lt;9;i++) {     statusdata[i] = (time &gt;&gt; 8*i &amp; 0xff); } </code></pre>  <p>The 8 bytes data data that I received is: </p>  <p><strong>01 00 00 00 00 00 00 3b</strong></p>  <p>The output of my method is:</p>  <p><strong>16777216</strong></p>  <p>I tried to convert this "16777216" to bytes using calculator and I got:</p>  <p><strong>01 00 00 00 00 00 00</strong></p>  <p>which means the 3b was not included in conversion. </p>  <p>But, I tried this code under java and it's working fine. I don't know where the problem is. </p>  <p>Please help. Thanks in advance!</p>
