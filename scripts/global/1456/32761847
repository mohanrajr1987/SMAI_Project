<p>I need to insert bytes into a string because I'm using the marshal Python module to serialize my functions (because I'll insert them into a database later). I need some way to pass the bytes through the MySQL query because whenever I try I get:</p>  <pre><code>Query += "'" + value + "'"  TypeError: Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitly </code></pre>  <p>So, I need to know what to do in order to pass it in my query variable without errors.</p>  <p>EDIT: since someone marked it as a duplicate, I can't simply decode it to utf-8 because it contains characters that utf8 doesn't support</p>
