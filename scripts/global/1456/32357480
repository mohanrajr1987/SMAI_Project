<p>I thought that 4MB would be 4 * 1024 * 1024 = 4,194,304 Bytes, but <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=how%20many%20bytes%20in%204MB" rel="nofollow">Google says</a> that it is 4,000,000 Bytes. Is there a different interpretation?</p>  <p>Well, according to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff538112.aspx" rel="nofollow">maximum transfer size</a> for Win7 bulk endpoint, I need to allocate 4MB of memory. Would this be 4,194,304 or 4,000,000?</p>
