<p>This is a question identical to previous post. The objective is to take a BYTE array of 2, 4, 6, 8 ,10 and insert them into a DWORD array via a LOOP to display them. This is my latest attempt.</p>  <pre><code>INCLUDE Irvine32.inc  .data  Array1 BYTE 2,4,6,8,10 Array2 DWORD 5 dup(0)  .code main PROC    mov esi, OFFSET Array1  ;esi = byteArray  mov edi, OFFSET Array2  ;edi = dwordArray  mov ecx, 5              ;counter of loop    DAWG:      mov eax, [esi]   ;attempting to use movzx causes errors      mov [edi], eax      inc esi      add edi, 4      loop DAWG </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions? Trying to figure it out with my bit (pun intended) of assembly knowledge. Thanks for reading.</p>
