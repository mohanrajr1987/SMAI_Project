<p>This may be the very basic question, but I am unable to find proper answer to my question. According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21300929/how-many-characters-can-you-store-with-1-byte">This post</a> it says 1 byte can hold 1 character and according to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179983/how-many-characters-can-a-java-string-have">this post</a> it says if string is of 4 bytes it can store 2^31 -1 characters. I am confused if 1 char = 1 byte then string of 4 byte should hold only 4 character. ( I know I am wrong , but can anyone explain me , what is wrong in my math ? )</p>
