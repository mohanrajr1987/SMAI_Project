<p>I'm confined to using only .Net 2.0 and trying to write something that will convert a byte to char.</p>  <p>Ideally I would use <code>Convert.ToChar(buffer[i]);</code> to get a char from a <code>byte</code> in a <code>byte[]</code> array but in .Net 2.0 this feature didn't exist. Using <code>BitConverter.ToChar(buffer, i)</code> seems to always result in array out of bounds errors.</p>  <p>Does anyone have a suggestion on how I might convert a byte to char in .Net 2.0?</p>
