<p>Sorry if this sounds confusing, but I have a GPS nav unit that sends out 72 byte packets via UDP. According to the manual of the GPS, byte 22 of the 72 byte packet is the first checksum to verify the integrity of the packet so far. I have been told that I need to add up the values of the first 21 bytes and compare the lowest byte of that answer with the checksum. If the values match, then the packet is valid so far.</p>  <p>To do this, I wrote C++ code that adds the first 21 bytes</p>  <pre><code>checksum = ((unsigned char) buf[0] + (unsigned char) buf[1] + (unsigned char) buf[2] + (unsigned char) buf[3] + (unsigned char) buf[4] + (unsigned char) buf[5] + (unsigned char) buf[6] + (unsigned char) buf[7] + (unsigned char) buf[8] + (unsigned char) buf[9] + (unsigned char) buf[10] + (unsigned char) buf[11] + (unsigned char) buf[12] + (unsigned char) buf[13] + (unsigned char) buf[14] + (unsigned char) buf[15] + (unsigned char) buf[16] + (unsigned char) buf[17] + (unsigned char) buf[18] + (unsigned char) buf[19] + (unsigned char) buf[20] + (unsigned char) buf[21]) </code></pre>  <p>My question is: how to I get the lowest 8 bits of this so I can compare it with byte 22? </p>
