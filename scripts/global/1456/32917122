<p>I created a program that takes user input and converts it into a char array. It then turns each char in the array to it's corresponding byte value, and prints all of them in a single line.</p>  <p>I am now creating a second program that I want to be able to paste that line of bytes into it as user input, and then have it display the original message in ASCII (English)</p>  <p>Here is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code>    import java.util.Scanner;       public class MessageDecoder     {          public static void main(String[] args)          {               System.out.println("Please enter your encrypted message and press Enter: ");               Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);               byte b = reader.nextByte();          }     } </code></pre>  <p>I have tried concatenating the line of bytes into a String, like this</p>  <pre><code>    System.out.println(b + ""); </code></pre>  <p>But that (probably obviously) didn't work.</p>  <p>What do I need to do? </p>
