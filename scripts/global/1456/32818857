<p>I am modifying old application and I have to add functionality to allow user view a file from SQL. File needs to be saved in temporary folder and deleted after closing application. I've managed to do all above, but I have to get filename of downloaded file (now Im using a string variable filename = "TemporaryDoc"). How can I get a filename from a data that is stored in datagridview.Rows(0).Items(0) ?</p>
