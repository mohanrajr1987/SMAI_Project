<p>I'm new to AngularJS and would definitely benefit from experient AngularJS developers! So here you go :</p>  <p>In AngularJS what is the difference in terms of performance of using ng-view (with router) or a custom directive to display templates (HTML partials) ?  </p>  <p>How big <strong>should</strong> be a custom directive ? From what I see a custom directive could substitute a view entirely but <strong>should it be used that way</strong> ? There might be benefits and drawbacks using one or the other. </p>  <p>What would the be the rules of thumb to use one or the other ?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance !</p>
