<p>I am using angular 1.4 and to prepare for the release of Angular 2, I am converting all my directives to use <code>restrict: 'E'</code> tag instead of <code>restrict: 'A'</code></p>  <p>But in doing this, I seem to have to add each custom tag to my sass file, and state that I want to treat it as though it was a div element, then display:block and other bootstrap defaults are used.</p>  <p>Is there a way I can do this without having to add each custom tag to my sass file, like more of a global setting?</p>
