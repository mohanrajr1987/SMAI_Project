<p>I have a directive setup as follows:</p>  <pre><code>angular.module("app", []).directive("myDirective", function(){      return {         scope: {},        link: function($scope){             $scope.myFunction = function(){                 //Do DOM manipulation            }         }      }   }); </code></pre>  <p>and in my html I simply have</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div my-directive&gt;     &lt;a href="" ng-click="myFunction()"&gt;Click Me&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>when I click "Click Me" nothing prints to the console, HOWEVER, if I remove the scope property or change it to <code>scope:true</code> then it works as expected. I know this has to do with isolate scope but I don't fully understand what's going on. I want to have an isolate scope as this is going to be a modular directive I will use in many different project.</p>  <p>NOTE: I'm using angular 1.4.6</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This function needs to do DOM manipulation. Which is why it's in the link function. </p>
