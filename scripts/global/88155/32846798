<p>I'm doing a web site for a client that want the site itself to work as a template for other projects. I'm using directives like this one:</p>  <pre><code>webApp.directive('layoutSection', function() {     return  {         restrict: 'C',         templateUrl: 'templates/layout__section.template.html'     } }) </code></pre>  <p>The idea is to just put the class inside the element and the directives does the rest. Anyway this method does not seem to be popular. I see that most people prefer to do a custom data attributes like <code>data-layout-section</code>.</p>  <p>There is a reason for this? Is a bad idea to use the <code>C</code> over the other methods?</p>
