<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/kstam/ng-scroll-repeat" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/kstam/ng-scroll-repeat</a> to load more item on reaching end of page through scrolling. </p>  <p>I noticed that the directive is expecting all the json array items for scroll repeat to be available initially. But in my application initially the json array contains only 20 items. Then if I click 'Load More..' link I will bring another 20 items, as shown below</p>  <pre><code>vm.loadMoreAPIs = function() {        vm.pageOffset = vm.pageOffset + vm.pageSize;        vm.bringItems(); //This call bring additional 20 items }; </code></pre>  <p>As I can get nearly 10000 jsons in the the array. I don't want to brig all at a time.</p>  <p>I replaced the above code in controller as,</p>  <pre><code>$scope.$on('bottom-reached-before', function() { // do whatever you want vm.loadMoreAPIs(); }); </code></pre>  <p>But after reaching the end of page through scrolling, new request call is not getting fired and my page always shows only first 20 items even after scrolling to the end of page. Is there any fix for this?</p>
