<p>I am looking to deny access to my /wp-admin/ folder to everyone but specific IP addresses. For everyone else, the page should serve a 404 error. Here's what I'm working with thus far:</p>  <pre><code>    # ALLOW USER BY IP     &lt;Limit GET POST&gt;     order deny,allow     deny from all     allow from 168.162.1.3     RedirectMatch 404 ".*"         &lt;/Limit&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I believe I'm close, but the problem is that a 404 error is not served, instead it creates a redirect loop. This would obviously be taxing on my server for no reason. So how then, can a simply serve a 404 error to everyone but these specific IP addresses and also deny them access to the repository?</p>
