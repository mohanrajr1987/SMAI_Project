<p>How can I get the local client IP using <strong>WebRTC</strong>.</p>  <p>I don't need the <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code> of the client but his local network IP. I've seen this before on websites like <code>sharedrop.com</code>, it recognizes computer within the same network using WebRTC.</p>  <p>In PHP I do this to get the clients remote IP:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php   echo $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]; // which would return 72.72.72.175 ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I looked through stackoverflow but every question is answered using the remote addr.</p>  <p>How can I get my local IP (192.168.1.24 for example) with JavaScript instead of the remote addr. </p>
