<p>There's <a href="http://usbip.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">USB/IP</a> tool which allows share access USB devices over TCP/IP network. USB device connected to Linux PC which running TCP server and Windows PC running VHCI driver which connects to Linux. This approach makes possible to emulate any USB device without hardware at all. All you need is write TCP server which will handle USB requests. (like <a href="http://breaking-the-system.blogspot.com/2014/08/emulating-usb-devices-in-python-with-no.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>  <p>But the problem with it that emulated device is not really correct. When you try to list connected USB devices using <strong>libusb</strong> you'll get an error <em>'unlisted ancestor for..'</em> since emulated device has no parent in device-tree.  From other hand some tools like <a href="http://zadig.akeo.ie/" rel="nofollow">Zadig</a> show emulated device.</p>  <p>Exactly problem discussed <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libusb/mailman/libusb-devel/thread/55198381.5040109@probo.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and no real solution provided.</p>  <p>So question is it bug in USB/IP windows driver? Can anybody experienced with Windows drivers development helps? What's a deal about parent device? Why it is so important?</p>  <p>Any hint will be very very appreciated! Thanks a lot in advance for any help</p>  <p>UDPATE : technically problem is that parent of emulated device (USB/IP enumerator) not recognized by libusb as HUB. This makes emulated devices ignored due-to NULL parent. So question is how to patch USB/IP driver to be visible by libusb as normal USB HUB</p>
