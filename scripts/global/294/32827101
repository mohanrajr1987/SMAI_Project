<p>I have a device connected to my computer via Ethernet. The IP address of the device is 169.254.54.98 and port number is 12002. When I type in "<a href="http://169.254.54.98" rel="nofollow">http://169.254.54.98</a>" on Google Chrome, I get a message that the webpage is not available. Obviously, when the device is connected via Ethernet, there is no internet connection. But when I type the IP address of the device on Chrome, shouldn't it be able to connect to the device?</p>
