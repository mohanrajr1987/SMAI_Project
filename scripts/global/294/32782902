<p>I am using Windows 7 64 Bits.</p>  <p>I have a static IPV4 configuration with a proxy in a company.</p>  <p>I have a Jenkins server running on my machine.</p>  <p>I used to access it with localhost:8080 with Firefox or with my own IP XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8080.</p>  <p>Other people could access this Jenkins server by entering my own IP and port in their web browser.</p>  <p>However, after some Windows magic updates, I have lost access to my server and my Jenkins slaves can not connect to this master Jenkins.</p>  <p>The access with localhost still works, but I and other people can not access the Jenkins server.</p>  <p>What I have tested?</p>  <ul> <li>I still can ping my own IP.</li> <li>I still can access my shared folders by entering my IP on other computers.</li> </ul>  <p>Is there a Windows magic option to activate my IP in my webbrowser to access my server?</p>
