<p>I was wondering how could i make sure that when a person goes to a certain webpage that it will direct him to a completely different thing IF his ip address is not listed?</p>  <p>also how can i make a terms and conditions pop up once they click on a certain navigation button BUT it would only be pop up ONCE on that same IP/ account</p>
