<p>I am making tests sending emails from My new web site to email adresses of differents ISP , i figured out that in case of gmail , it arrives inbox , in case of hotmail it is not delivering to either inbox or junk folder , is there a way to get My emails delivered to hotmail inbox with new IP or zero reputation of a DNS ??</p>
