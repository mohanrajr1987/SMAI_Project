<p>My 3 Windows computers have the following network IPs:</p>  <p>*Computer 1 IP: 192.168.100.1  *Computer 2 IP: 192.168.100.2  *Apache Computer 3 IP: 192.168.100.3 (this computer is running Apache )</p>  <p>I can access apache from the same apache hosting computer by writting <a href="http://localhost" rel="nofollow">http://localhost</a> in the firefox browser </p>  <p>I can access Apache server by writing the IP: 192.168.100.3 on the browser of any of the 2 computers above. </p>  <p>I can change the IP Address of apache hosting computer 3 into anything that follows the format 192.168.100.XXX.XXX and get it to work in all the other 2 computers with the listed IPs. When I change the IP of the computer running the Apache server into something like XXX.XXX.100.3, I can't access it from the 3 computers above... </p>  <p>I am going to use the Apache server in my workplace and I don't want to mix it with network IPs. Any workaround to the problem?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
