<p>I am trying to set up few (Windows) application servers on a single Linux server.</p>  <p>There are no Linux binaries, but the emulated windows' EXE works.</p>  <pre><code>wineconsole --backend=curses dedicated.exe -r config.cfg </code></pre>  <p>The Machine has 4 IPs, so I'd love to run each server (daemon) on different IP, to be able to access them all.</p>  <p>But there is no such option to set IP on the server (server's config doesn't include such feature). You can only set up a port, but if the port is different than the default port number [7500], the client won't see the server (on the client's side, there is no „connect” option, only servers list – which scans the network by the default port), so yeah... that's a tough one.</p>  <p>I was thinking, is it possible to „restrict” wine to a use specified network interface, so I can run few instances, and force them to use different Network Interfaces, which more-less means different IP.</p>  <p>eg.:</p>  <pre><code>wineconsole --backend=curses --network=eth0:0 dedicated.exe -r config.cfg wineconsole --backend=curses --network=eth0:1 dedicated.exe -r config.cfg </code></pre>  <p>Or do you see any other opportunity to run few instances of such software on the same machine?</p>  <p>I don't want to setup a VM, cause it sounds like shooting from a cannon to a bird.</p>
