<p>I am planning to get <code>VPS</code> for a website and Traccar app (<a href="https://www.traccar.org" rel="nofollow">https://www.traccar.org</a>). I don't have a lot of experience with setting up this kind of solution, so I want to ask first. I have no problem with installing Apache, setting up the website and install the app, but here is the thing. On the website <strong>www.xyz.com</strong> there is a <strong>log in</strong> button which will direct to the app interface, which I like to be on <strong>app.xyz.com</strong>. I can setup the app to be accessible on a different port then 80. How do you setup the server? vHost with different ports?</p>
