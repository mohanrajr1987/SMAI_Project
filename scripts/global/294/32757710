<p>just new to stackoverflow. I have an issue with regards to using "ping" command in my PC's command prompt. I am using windows 7 OS.</p>  <p>Whenever I issue a "ping VMSTBOX" command in my cmd it returns "destination host unreachable". VMSTBOX is my Computer Name. However when I use "ping 192.168.111.223" which is my IP address in in my <strong>Local Area Connection-->Properties-->TCP/IPv4</strong> . it works just fine. They are basically just the same machine but why doesnt it work when i use my computer name?</p>  <p>I triple checked everything to make sure there are no typos in the inputs or names used but to no avail. I can't post a screenshot since I need 10 points to be able to post an image.</p>  <p>Any help or suggestions to fixing this would be a great help Thanks!</p>
