<p>There is an app which allows 5â‚¬ vouchers (code "welcome") to new customers.</p>  <p>I tried to open a second account and use the voucher again but it somehow detects me as an old customer. I changed all the data and even tried a new device via a virtual machine. But it still detects me.</p>  <p>How does the app possible do that, and so how I can I use the voucher again?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WgH9v.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WgH9v.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
