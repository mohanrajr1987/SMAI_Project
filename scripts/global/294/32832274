<p>The alternative is to use a daemon to manage and hand out those IP addresses. Trying to get DHCP daemon software to serve out IP addresses in 127.0.0.0/8 is weird and doesn't seem to work well for me and the alternative is to write my own DHCP like daemon (but for localhost.) Also, a daemon has troubles with staleness unlike with the OS which knows when applications unexpectedly exit.</p>  <p>Also, I can't use the trick of <code>connect</code>ing to a broadcast address to auto-bind to an address because that doesn't allow me to select the port.</p>
