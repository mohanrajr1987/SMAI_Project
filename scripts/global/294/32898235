<p>I am trying to build a device that will connect to my android smartphone that will tell me if it is outside a certain radius. I cannot use Bluetooth or GPS. I am thinking of using WiFi and tracking the distance between the IP addresses in real time. I know that it is possible with two stable devices, but is is possible with two moving objects, and also, how I could code it?</p>
