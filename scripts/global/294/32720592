<p>I am trying to make a simple chatting application on Android with Smack 4.1 and Openfire 3.10, everything works fine in local environment, but users cannot login or exchange messages from other(outside) networks. </p>  <p>The system I am using to perform all these work on is Mac OS X Yosemite, and Domain(Server) name used in Openfire server is the default one given by the server when I initially set it up. Also, this is the code I used to configure  XMPP connection: ConnectionConfiguration config = new AndroidConnectionConfiguration(domain, 5222);</p>  <p>I have searched through the internet, I guess, due to mine lack of knowledge about network connection, I still cannot understand the logic behind these terms, such as Domain, Internal IP, Public IP, DNS, DMZ, etc, and obviously I cannot get this App work except under my home LAN(Verizon).</p>  <p>Anyone have ever had experience with Openfire, please help with this issue.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
