<p>I have a simple Prolog predicate that spits accepts a variable, <code>Result</code>, that calculates a result then stores it in <code>Result</code> to be viewed. Sometimes I'm unsure how it comes to the answer it stores in <code>Result</code> and I'm curious if there's a way in Prolog to get it to show how it got to the answer, I guess show the path it took and how it built it up?</p>  <p>The predicate is something simple like <code>solve(Input, Result).</code> and <code>Result</code> can sometimes be peculiar.</p>
