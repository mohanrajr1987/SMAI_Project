<p>In Prolog I have a db like this:</p>  <pre><code>invoice(number,item,product,value).  invoice('2015/01',1,coffee,100). invoice('2015/02',1,water,50). invoice('2015/02',2,coffee,100). invoice('2015/03',1,milk,80). invoice('2015/03',2,cake,150). </code></pre>  <p>I need to ask Prolog this question: How many invoices have NO coffee or water ? In this case the answer would be 1 (the invoice number 2015/03)</p>  <p>I also wanted to answer this question in an Excel DB. I use a "=countifs" function but it only gives me the number of items that are not coffee or water... something like this:</p>  <pre><code>=COUNTIFS(D4:D11;"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"coffee";D4:D11;"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"water") </code></pre>  <p>it gives me 2 in this example, </p>  <p>But I would like to have only the number of invoices.</p>
