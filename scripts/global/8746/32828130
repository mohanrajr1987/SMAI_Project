<p>Our textbook gave us this example of a structurer for a math equation in Prolog:</p>  <pre><code>math(Result) --&gt; number(Number1), operator(Operator), number(Number2), { Result = [Number1, Operator, Number2] }.  operator('+') --&gt; ['+'].  number('number') --&gt; ['NUMBER']. </code></pre>  <p>I'm quite new to Prolog, however, and I have no idea how to use this example to get the output. I'm under the impression it restructures the input using <code>Result</code> and outputs it for use.</p>  <p>The only input I've tried that doesn't cause an error is <code>math('number', '+', 'number').</code> but it always outputs <code>false</code> and I don't know why. Furthermore shouldn't it restructure it and give me the result in <code>Result</code> as well?</p>  <p>What should I be inputting here?</p>
