<p>I am working on a Prolog program that would take two lists, calculates the average of the elements at the corresponding indices and returns the averages as a list. </p>  <p>This my code. I'm getting <code>is/2: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated</code> error. </p>  <pre><code>sum(H,T,S) :-    S is H + T.  avelists([],[],_). avelists([Head|Tail],[Head2|Tail2],[X|Tail3) :-    X is sum(Head,Head2,A)/2,    avelists(Tail,Tail2,Tail3). </code></pre>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>?-  avelists([1,4,3],[3,6,5],Xs]). Xs = [2,5,4].                          % expected result </code></pre>  <p>Why is it not working and giving me that error? It looks to me like it should work. </p>
