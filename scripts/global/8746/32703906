<p>I have a string that I want to convert to a list:</p>  <pre><code>"a + b = c" </code></pre>  <p>I need it in list format to pass it onto to a member rule. When I pass it onto the member rule directly, it passes as a series of numbers which I assume is their character code, but I want the actual characters instead. How do I make it into a list then use it with a rule. I'm a novice in Prolog so I would appreciate any help.</p>
