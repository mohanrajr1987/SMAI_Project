<p>Let's say we have two variables <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. <code>X</code> is <code>53</code> and <code>Y</code> is <code>52</code>. What I want to do is compare them by adding <code>1</code> to the <code>Y</code>, so that it would be <code>53</code> - therefore <code>X</code> would be equal to <code>Y + 1</code>.</p>  <p>I am trying to do it by simply using equal operator and addition for <code>Y</code> variables, like so:</p>  <pre><code>X == Y + 1 </code></pre>  <p>Even though this looks simple enough, I am getting <code>false</code> as the result. What am I missing?</p>
