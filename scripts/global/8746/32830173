<p>So basing on the idea that: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Every man is mortal.</p>      <p>Socrates is a man.</p>      <p>So, Socrates is mortal.</p> </blockquote>  <p>In Prolog:</p>  <pre><code>man(socrates). mortal(X) :- man(X). </code></pre>  <p>My question is... what's the equivalent to the above for:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Every student loves work.</p>      <p>This is work.</p>      <p>Therefore, I love this work.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I know this is beginner stuff, I'm just having an issue with the logical thinking here.</p>
