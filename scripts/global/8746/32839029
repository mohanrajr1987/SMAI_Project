<p>I'm using the <code>in/1</code> predicate to try and constrain an integer to take values from a certain set:</p>  <pre><code>?- use_module(library(clpfd)).  gen_in_set(X) :-     X in [0, 1, 3, 5, 7]. </code></pre>  <p>I didn't expect this to work, since <code>[...]</code> is list notation. I could of course use:</p>  <pre><code>    X #= 0 #\/ X #= 1 #\/ X #= 3 #\/ X #= 5 #\/ X #= 7. </code></pre>  <p>but this is very verbose. The following also works:</p>  <pre><code>    X in 0 \/ 1 \/ 3 \/ 5 \/ 7. </code></pre>  <p>and is a bit shorter, but still quite ugly.</p>  <p>The documentation states:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Var is an element of Domain. Domain is one of:</p>      <p>Integer       Singleton set consisting only of Integer.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've tried searching for what a singleton set is (Prolog newbie here), but I couldn't find anything online. Is there a cleaner way of expressing my constraint?</p>
