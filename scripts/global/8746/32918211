<p>I am fresh in Prolog. And I am trying to write a predicate that finds the Max value and its index of a list of integers. i.e <code>max_list([2,3,4], MAX, INDEX)</code> will yield <code>MAX=4</code>, <code>INDEX=2</code></p>  <p>Thank you for reply~ My apologize! This is the first time I ask questions in stackoverflow. I could write a predicate to find the maximum or a minimum of a list, but I don't know how to get the exact position the value in the list. I am just trying to comprehend the answers.     </p>
