After this, the next element of L is the second element of the first list in Ls, and so on, until two elements have been taken from all the lists in Ls. After this, come the third elements of all the lists in Ls, and so on, until all the elements of all the lists in Ls are included in L.</p>  <p>forexample: I have a list <code>Ls=[[a,b],[c,d],[e,f]]</code> and want to get this <code>L=[a,c,e,b,d,f]</code> or I have <code>Ls=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]</code> and I want to get <code>L=[1,4,2,5,3,6]</code></p>
