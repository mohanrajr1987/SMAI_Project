<p>I'm very new to prolog. I have a size of list predicate. I'm trying to make another predicate that takes two arguments (an int, and a list) and it calls the size of list predicate on the passed in list and returns true if the list size matches the int passed in.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far.</p>  <pre><code>size([],0). size([H|T],N) :- size(T,N1), N is N1+1.  isEqual[X,Y] :- X/size[Y,N]. %X is an int representing expected length of list, Y is the list </code></pre>  <p>Advice is welcomed. </p>
