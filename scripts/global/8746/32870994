<p>I'm trying to specify a DCG for a valid number that would be used like so:</p>  <pre><code>value(Number) --&gt; valid_number(Number). </code></pre>  <p>Basically checking if a specified value is numeric, (it could also be a variable, so it's necessary to check). </p>  <p>I don't know how to build this <code>valid_number</code> DCG/predicate though.</p>  <p>Right now I just have:</p>  <pre><code>valid_number('1') --&gt; ['1']. valid_number('2') --&gt; ['2']. ... </code></pre>  <p>Which works but it obviously terrible. Trying something like:</p>  <pre><code>valid_number(Number) --&gt; { integer(Number), Number = Number }. </code></pre>  <p>Which both doesn't work and admittedly looks pretty gross as well (I'm sorry, very new to Prolog and trying to learn best practices).</p>  <p>How would I go about building this DCG/predicate that validates whether or not it's a number?</p>
