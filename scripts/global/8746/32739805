<p>i am a novice in Prolog.Now I want to use Prolog to solve arithmetic expression problems. suppose we have a predicate like this: <code>expr(E,Val,Var,Sol)</code> the first is the expression the second is the value the third one is the variable and the forth one is the result. for example if we ask: <code>expr(3+x,2,x,S)</code>the answer will be <code>S=5</code> and if we ask <code>expr(5*6,3,x,S)</code> the answer will be <code>S=30</code> in this case the x doesn't appear in the expression so we just ignore the variable and its value. I want to know how can I implement it,can you guys give me some hints</p>
