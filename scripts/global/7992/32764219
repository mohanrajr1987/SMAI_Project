<p>I have a form which needs to meet certain conditions. As of now, I'm trying to make the fields "FirstName" "LastName" and "MusicGenre" required. If they aren't filled I have an alert notifying the user. So far I can get the alert to execute if FirstName and LastName aren't filled, but I can't get the MusicGenre field to be required. Must be syntax or something? Here is what I have so far: (using MVC)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;     function validateForm() {      var FirstName = $("#FirstName").val();      var LastName = $("#LastName").val();      var PhoneNumber = $("#PhoneNumber").val();     var Email = $("Email").val;     var MusicGenre = $("#MusicGenre").val();      if ((FirstName == null || FirstName == "") || (LastName == null || LastName == "")  || (MusicGenre == null || MusicGenre == ""))      {         alert("First and last names are required, as well as a phone number OR an e-mail address");         return false;     }     else {         return true;     } } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>
