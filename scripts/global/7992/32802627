<p>I am attempting to create a function that will read each word from a text file, call a separate function (clean_entry) to remove punctuation and capitalization, and then send each word to a map to hold the words and the number of times they appear.  My code for this function is as follows.</p>  <pre><code>void get_words(map&lt;string, int&gt;&amp; wordList, ifstream&amp; doc) {  string              dirty,                     clean;  while (doc &gt;&gt; dirty){      if (dirty.length() &gt; 0) {         clean_entry(dirty, clean);         wordList[clean]++;     } } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>When compiling this code, I am given the error no operator >> matches operands, operand types ifstream >> string.</p>  <p>I have tried finding others with similar problems, but all my research has either been others with the operator error in completely different circumstances, or comments saying that the "while (ifstream >> string)" format is exactly how to move through each word in a file, so I am still at a loss.</p>  <p>Can someone please clue me in to what exactly I am doing wrong?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
