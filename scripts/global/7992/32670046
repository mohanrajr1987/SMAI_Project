<p>Hi programming in Matlab here, and for some reason I keep getting errors in my while loop. Can anyone give me an example on how to make multiple conditions in a while loop? Here is my while loop,</p>  <pre><code>while (user_input ~= 256);%try catch does not work very well for this  prompt = 'Please enter one of the listed gray levels (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2). ';  user_input = input(prompt); end </code></pre>  <p>I would like it to be something like ,</p>  <pre><code>while (user_input ~= 256 || user_input ~= 128 || user_input ~= 64) </code></pre>  <p>Thank you for your help!</p>
