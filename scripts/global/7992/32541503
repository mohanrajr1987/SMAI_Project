<p>When I'm coding, I choose a random value from a list and print it alongside two numbers to make a sum. However, the value from the list still shows the quotation marks and I don't understand why. The code is:</p>  <pre><code>import random level = input('Please choose either easy, medium or hard') if level == 'easy':     num1 = random.randint(1,5)     num2 = random.randint(1,5)     #Chooses a random operator from the list     op = random.choice(['+', '-', '*'])     #Arranges it so the larger number is printed first     if num1 &gt; num2:         sum1 = (num1, op, num2)     else:         sum1 = (num2, op, num1)     #Prints the two numbers and the random operator     print(sum1) </code></pre>  <p>I try running this code and the result I am given is:</p>  <pre><code>(4, '*', 3) </code></pre>  <p>When I want it to appear as:</p>  <pre><code>4*3 </code></pre>  <p>Those numbers are randomly generated also but work fine. Does anyone know how to solve this problem?</p>
