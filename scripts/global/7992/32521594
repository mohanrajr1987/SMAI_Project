<p>I want to build a dynamic operator changer in a if loop. I get the operator greater than and less than from an XML and I store it in a dictionary.</p>  <pre><code>private static IDictionary&lt;string, Rule&gt; machine = new Dictionary&lt;string, Rule&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>This dictionary stores a key along with a class of 3 values say (machineID(string), InnerText(int) and operator (greaterthan or lessthan ))</p>  <p>In another class I am trying to retrieve InnerText and comparing it with the Opeartor that is saved, byt I face a problem that even the operator changes for every xml file. SO i want to change the operator dynamically depending on the dictionary values in the below if condition.</p>  <pre><code>if (actualrange &gt; newrange)    machineHealth = false; else    machineHealth = true; </code></pre>  <p>XML :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;condition type="healthy" operator="greaterthan"&gt;100&lt;/condition&gt; &lt;condition type="healthy" operator="lessthan"&gt;30&lt;/condition&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to change the operator(> or &lt;) symbol in the if condition above depending on the value from the xml each time. How this can be done.</p>
