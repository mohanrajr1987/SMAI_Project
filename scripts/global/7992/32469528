<p>I have been programming a program that tests a value <code>(0&lt;=value&lt;=9)</code> and checks if it is '0' or not. (if not, it'll be from 1-9)</p>  <p>I would like to know whether <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> would be faster/better (I believe this would be in the machine code level?), if there is any other efficient way to do this, or if there is no difference at all.</p>  <p>To put in perspective:</p>  <pre><code>if (value == 0) {      //do something } else {     //do something else }  </code></pre>  <p>Or...</p>  <pre><code>if (value != 0) {      //do something else } else {     //do something }  </code></pre>  <p>PS: My program repeats this code many times, so even a small difference can affect my program.</p>
