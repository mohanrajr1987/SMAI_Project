<p>I have seen the following type of code before:</p>  <pre><code>Method("item one" | "item two") </code></pre>  <p>What exactly does it do? In my code I have.</p>  <pre><code>IsInRole(RoleEnum.Administrator | RoleEnum.Moderator) </code></pre>  <p>How I would expect it to happen is that it checks is in role Administrator OR Moderator but it returns false, when the user is just in Administrator. I am not sure what it is called when you do that but I am interested in knowing what it exactly does and the reasoning/times you could use something like that.</p>
