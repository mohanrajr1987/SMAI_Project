<p>I just saw an expression like <code>1 and "b"</code> in <code>python</code> code and even <code>1 and "a" or "b"</code>.</p>  <p>I checked the <code>help</code> for <code>int</code> and figured out that <code>and</code> means bitwise and with two integers </p>  <pre><code>__and__(...)  |      x.__and__(y) &lt;==&gt; x&amp;y </code></pre>  <p>but there's no mention of a <code>str</code> as second operand. I assume that there's no way that the <code>str</code> can be interpreted as <code>int</code> because there's just no way of conversion or casting and that I'm thus missing a meaning of <code>and</code>.</p>  <p>Then I started experimenting to get the first expression above to be <code>1</code>, but no success.</p>
