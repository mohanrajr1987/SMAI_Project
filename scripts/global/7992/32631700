<p>The following expression seems to work as intended and return the current timestamp.</p>  <pre><code>new Date().getTime() </code></pre>  <p>However I can't understand why operators are applied in strict left-to-right order here.</p>  <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Operator_precedence">MDN</a> says the member (<code>.</code>) operator has higher priority than <code>new</code>. This would mean that <code>.</code> must be applied before <code>new</code>. So the expression should be evaluated as:</p>  <pre><code>new (Date().getTime()) </code></pre>  <p>But in fact it is evaluated as:</p>  <pre><code>(new Date()).getTime() </code></pre>  <p>I guess there has to be something I've overlooked, but I can't understand what.</p>  <p><em>Note</em>: I don't actually use this expression (I prefer <code>Date.now()</code> method). It's just my curiosity.</p>
