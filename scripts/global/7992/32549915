<p>What is the exact difference between the <code>+</code> and the <code>,</code> operator in PowerShell? For instance when simply trying to concatenate two arrays both produce the same output, but I cannot sort the result of a <code>,</code> operation, only the result of a <code>+</code> operation:</p>  <pre><code>$a = Get-ChildItem C:\ $b = Get-ChildItem C:\Windows # Does not sort anything, actually is the same output as $a, $b $a , $b | sort # Sort actually works $a + $b | sort </code></pre>  <p>What confuses me even more is the fact, that both operators return the same type:</p>  <pre><code>PS C:\&gt; ($a,$b).getType().Name Object[] PS C:\&gt; ($a+$b).getType().Name Object[] </code></pre>
