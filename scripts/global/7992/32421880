<pre><code>int main() {     int x=35;     printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n",x==35,x=50,x&gt;35);     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>In the above main function the output comes out to be 0 50 0. Why is it so that the comparison operator is producing an output of 0 even when the value of <code>x</code> is equal to 35.</p>  <p>I am also bit confused in the output produced by <code>x&gt;35</code> because when this is compiled the value of <code>x</code> has been updated to 50 than why is it so that it produces an output of 0 instead of 1.</p>
