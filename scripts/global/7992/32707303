<p>My code is for a guessing game, user guesses a number between 1-100. They have 10 tries, after each guess it tells them if its too low or too high, etc.</p>  <p>A problem I'm having that I can't seem to fix is that after they won it tells them they won and how many guesses it took them to win (using <code>guesses</code> variable). My problem is that if they win, and they play again, the guesses doesn't reset. So if it takes them 5 tries on the first game, and 8 tries on the second game, in the second game it will tell them they won in 13 guesses (5 from first + 8 from second).</p>  <p>I know why it's happening, but everything I try doesn't seem to fix it. I assumed if i just did something like <code>guesses = 0;</code> in the same spot I do <code>attemptsLeft = 10;</code> that it would work since the <code>attemptsLeft</code> is working fine, but then it just always says they won and it took them 0 guesses. I also tried setting <code>guesses = 0;</code> inside the <code>if</code> statements for when they win/lose but it does the same thing and says they won in 0 guesses.</p>  <h2>Code for GuessingGame class</h2>  <pre><code>namespace NumberGuessingGame {     public class GuessingGame     {          int myGuess = 0;         int guessesLeft = 10;         public int gamesPlayed = 0;         public int gamesWon = 0;         public int gamesLost = 0;         public int attemptsLeft = 10;         public int guesses = 0;          Random rand;         int number = 0;          public GuessingGame()         {                        attemptsLeft = 10;             rand = new Random();             number = rand.Next(1, 100);                     }         public void ResetGame()         {                         attemptsLeft = 10;             number = rand.Next(1, 100);             guessesLeft = 10;                     }                         public int CheckGuess(int newGuess)         {             myGuess = newGuess;              if (guessesLeft &lt; 1)             {                                gamesLost++;                 gamesPlayed++;                 ResetGame();                                 return 2;                             }             else if (myGuess &gt; number)             {                 attemptsLeft--;                 guesses++;                 guessesLeft--;                 return 1;             }             else if (myGuess &lt; number)             {                                                attemptsLeft--;                 guesses++;                 guessesLeft--;                 return -1;             }             else             {                                guesses++;                 gamesWon++;                 gamesPlayed++;                 ResetGame();                                 return 0;             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <h2>Code for form class</h2>  <pre><code>namespace NumberGuessingGame {     public partial class frmMain : Form     {         public frmMain()         {             InitializeComponent();                    }                  GuessingGame myGuess = new GuessingGame();          private void btnCheck_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)         {             int inputGuess = Convert.ToInt32(txtGuess.Text);             int result = myGuess.CheckGuess(inputGuess);                                                         if(result == 2)             {                 lblLosses.Text = "Losses: " + myGuess.gamesLost;                 lblPlayed.Text = "Games Played: " + myGuess.gamesPlayed;                 lblWins.Text = "Wins: " + myGuess.gamesWon;                                                        MessageBox.Show("You ran out of guesses and lost!");                             }             else if(result == 1)             {                                MessageBox.Show("Your guess was too high, try again!" + "\n You have " + myGuess.attemptsLeft + " guesses left");             }             else if(result == -1)             {                 MessageBox.Show("Your guess was too low, try again!" + "\n You have " + myGuess.attemptsLeft + " guesses left");             }             else if(result == 0)             {                                 MessageBox.Show("You won!" + "\n It took you " + myGuess.guesses + " guesses");                                 lblLosses.Text = "Losses: " + myGuess.gamesLost;                 lblPlayed.Text = "Games Played: " + myGuess.gamesPlayed;                 lblWins.Text = "Wins: " + myGuess.gamesWon;                 }                                } </code></pre>
