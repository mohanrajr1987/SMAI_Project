<p>Another class is going to pass in random numbers into this <code>method(x,y,z)</code>. I want to know the <code>boolean</code> that does returns true from my last <code>if()</code> statement, so I can do operations on it.  I have explained my logic in the comments.</p>  <p>I am still really new to this, so my logic may be wrong.</p>  <pre><code>public static String FindDate(int x, int y, int z) {     boolean istrue1 =(x &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 31);     boolean istrue2 =(y &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; y &lt;= 31);     boolean istrue3 =(z &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; z &lt;= 31);     if(istrue1 ^ istrue2){         if(istrue1^istrue3){             if(istrue2^istrue3){//now knowing that no values are the same, i can find the true value.                 if(istrue1||istrue2||istrue3){                 // I want to store/use/print/know which bool(istrue) that evaluated to true, so I would know if it is                 //x,y,z that went through the algorithm successfully.                  }               }  else{return "Ambiguous";}               }else{return "Ambiguous";}           }else{return "Ambiguous";}     return "true"; //I would actually end up returning the value that went through the algorithm     } </code></pre>
