<p>For my code, it is a number guessing game. They get 10 guesses before they lose, and it tells them if it is too low, too high etc. In my output when I'm telling them if they are too high or too low, I also wanted to display how many guesses they have left. But currently it tells them they have 9 guesses left every time and I'm not sure why. </p>  <p>The rest of the program works. So after 10 guesses it will tell them they lost, just every guess up until then it says they have 9 guesses left.</p>  <pre><code>namespace NumberGuessingGame { public class GuessingGame {      int myGuess = 0;     int guessesLeft = 10;     int gamesPlayed = 0;     int gamesWon = 0;     int gamesLost = 0;      Random rand;     int number = 0;      public GuessingGame()     {         rand = new Random();         number = rand.Next(1, 100);     }     public void ResetGame()     {         number = rand.Next(1, 100);         guessesLeft = 10;     }      public int CheckGuess(int newGuess)     {         myGuess = newGuess;          if (guessesLeft &lt; 1)         {                             gamesLost++;             gamesPlayed++;             ResetGame();             return 2;         }         else if (myGuess &gt; number)         {                             guessesLeft--;             return 1;         }         else if (myGuess &lt; number)         {                            guessesLeft--;             return -1;         }         else         {                             gamesPlayed++;             gamesWon++;             ResetGame();             return 0;         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>Code for form class</p>  <pre><code>namespace NumberGuessingGame { public partial class frmMain : Form {     public frmMain()     {         InitializeComponent();                }              GuessingGame myGuess = new GuessingGame();      private void btnCheck_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         int inputGuess = Convert.ToInt32(txtGuess.Text);         int result = myGuess.CheckGuess(inputGuess);          int guessesLeft = 10;           if(result == 2)         {              MessageBox.Show("You ran out of guesses and lost!");         }         else if(result == 1)         {             guessesLeft--;             MessageBox.Show("Your guess was too high, try again!" + "\n You have " + guessesLeft + " guesses left");         }         else if(result == -1)         {             guessesLeft--;             MessageBox.Show("Your guess was too low, try again!" + "\n You have " + guessesLeft + " guesses left");         }         else if(result == 0)         {             MessageBox.Show("You won!");         }      } } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
