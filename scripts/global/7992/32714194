<p><code>String</code> is a special case in Java. It's a class, which I can examine in the <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u6/jdk/file/8c2c5d63a17e/src/share/classes/java/lang/String.java">source code</a>, but it also has its own infix operator <code>+</code>, which seems to be syntactic sugar for <code>StringBuilder</code>. </p>  <p>For example, </p>  <pre><code>"Hello " + yourName; </code></pre>  <p>could become </p>  <pre><code>new StringBuilder().append("Hello ").append(yourName).toString(); </code></pre>  <p>There are no user-defined operators in Java, so where is <code>+</code> specified for <code>String</code>? </p>  <p>Could the same mechanism be used to make additional operators, such as for vectors? </p>
