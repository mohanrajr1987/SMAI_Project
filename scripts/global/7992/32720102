<p>I have some issues while working with cdo operators. I have some gridded netcdf files with hourly data. I need to extract one variable from each netcdf and its respective monthly mean values. </p>  <p>So I use the "cdo selvar" and "cdo monmean" operators. The cdo always process the data successfully (no errors) but sometimes it happens that when I check the outputs one or more of them are 2,3 or even more times larger in size than what they are supposed to. </p>  <p>So every time this happens I have to delete the defected outputs and process those netcdfs from the beginning, and generally I get the right size at second or third attempt. Is it a bug? I'd like to know if there is any explanation for this. It makes me waste a lot of time.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance</p>
