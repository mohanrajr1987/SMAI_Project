<p>Learning python. I’ve doubt on use of following operators:</p>  <pre><code>!=  —&gt; Checks if the value of two operands is equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. &lt;&gt; —&gt; Checks if the value of two operands is equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. </code></pre>  <p>The above definition is right(<a href="http://tutorialspoint.com" rel="nofollow">referred from book</a>)? If yes, when we use both operators. Please share your experience with correct situation!!!</p>
