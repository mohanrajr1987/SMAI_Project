<p>I can't seem to find anything online, so I will ask - how would one go about using an operator once it has been popped off a stack? </p>  <p>For example I need something like this, but have no idea how to get that operator to work.</p>  <pre><code>public void operation() {       Integer x = valueStack.pop();     Integer y = valueStack.pop();     Object op = operatorStack.pop();      valStk.push(y *op* x);     } </code></pre>
