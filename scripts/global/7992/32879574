<p>I am taking CS420 - Operating Systems.  My professor mentioned something in class the other day that peaked my interest and I have been researching it and have gotten close but cannot find out the answer.  </p>  <p>He mentioned that him and another professor had wondered in the past if the creation of the ++/-- operators was originally intended to bind the ++/-- operators to the test-and-set operation/instruction.  </p>  <p>He said that they weren't able to figure it out.  I didn't ask him how much effort they had invested in this but would be very interested in the communities input.  </p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
