<p>I have the following query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT t1.location AS Locations, COUNT( t1.location ) AS Total, tab.Responses, tab.location AS tablocation FROM  `trespondent_acme` t1 LEFT JOIN (  SELECT location, COUNT( location ) AS Responses FROM  `trespondent_acme`  WHERE completion_status IN ( 'Started',  'Complete' ) GROUP BY location )tab ON t1.location = tab.location GROUP BY t1.location </code></pre>  <p>This provides the output (almost) that I am looking for.  In essence, it counts how many people there are in the various Locations in the <code>respondent</code> table and then also counts how many of those have responses from the <code>results</code> table.</p>  <p>Where I am coming unstuck is that I only want to count those from the <code>results</code> table that have completed if their response to a question doesn't equal a value - the MySQL code I am using is this</p>  <pre><code>WHERE q13 &lt;&gt; 'OPTION' </code></pre>  <p>The problem I am facing is where to place this part of the query to get the result I need.  Q13 resides within the <code>results</code> table by the way.  The places I have tried are:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT t1.location AS Locations, COUNT( t1.location ) AS Total,  tab.Responses, tab.location AS tablocation FROM  `trespondent_acme` WHERE q13 &lt;&gt; 'OPTION' t1 </code></pre>  <p>But the above gives a MySQL query error, I've also tried before the two groups at the end of the existing query but again, no joy.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I can now see that I don't reference or link <code>tresults_acme</code> in my query above and as Q13 resides within this table, that's the first hurdle I have.</p>  <p>Any advice welcomed.</p>
