<p>I am currently in the process of developing a website in Drupal for a football club. However, they have a requirement: to create a module, from a database of players and their phone numbers, send a SMS to alert them of their selection or not the game of the weekend. I like to know if this is possible or not, free way? I have heard of SMS Framework, but it seems complicated to use for a non-IT (the one who will manage the site within the club in the future). There there other solutions?</p>  <p>Best regards</p>
