<p>I have searched around but it seems everything ends up at having to pay a monthly fee of some kind.</p>  <p>I was using google voice to reverify twitter accounts but they have been blocked now for some reaosn. I only used them for a week or two before they've been blocked.</p>  <p>I want a desktop solution cos it's a nuisance having to do it on my mobile.</p>  <p>Also note that i don't have a smartphone/iphone whatever they are called so can't use some kind of fancy app to run texts from my phone on desktop which I see is another popular solution.</p>  <p>Any other leads?</p>
