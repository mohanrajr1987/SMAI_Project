<p>I'm programming a new device that's communicating with server through GPRS. To save battery GSM module is off most of the time. I want to be able to change config by sending an SMS to it.</p>  <p>The problem is that Module doesn't see SMS every time. I'm sending SMS when it's off and after turning on it doesn't receive anything. It is that due to some delays on the service provider side?</p>  <p>How to ask provider to resend this SMS? Sending second SMS while module is ON makes it receive both SMS'.</p>  <p>Simple commands to test it:</p>  <pre><code>// reset here AT+CMGF=1 // set TEXT mode AT+CMGL="ALL" // receive ALL </code></pre>  <p>Even after few minutes <code>AT+CMGL="ALL"</code> can give nothing.</p>  <p>Thank you for your help.</p>
