<p>so i have ZTE MF70 modem. It used 3G SIM to get connected to internet. It has a web interface to manage the configuration, setup, and send or receive messages (SMS).  </p>  <p>If anyone know how to get something like callback, or API from the modem's web interface so i can code and getting the messages list, then i will create notifications via email or something whenever new SMS arrived. </p>  <p>Is there any reference how to do it, i don't think ZTE will have a document or guide how to do something like this for developer.</p>
