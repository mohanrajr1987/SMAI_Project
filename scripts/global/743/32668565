<p>I am trying to use this sms plugin - <a href="https://github.com/Ivanezko/Phonegap-SMS" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Ivanezko/Phonegap-SMS</a> in my ionic android application. I am following the Readme documentation to install the plugin. In the second step author asked to do -</p>  <pre><code>Require the plugin module  var smsplugin = cordova.require("info.asankan.phonegap.smsplugin.smsplugin");  </code></pre>  <p>What this statement means and where should I include this code to make use of this plugin?</p>  <p>I tried to do this in my controller file and its giving error cordova is not defined.</p>  <p>I tried debugging a little more in an emulator and the error given in the require statement is - <strong><em>module info.asankan.phonegap.smsplugin.smsplugin is not found.</em></strong></p>
