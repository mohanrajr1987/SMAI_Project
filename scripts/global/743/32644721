<p>I would like to share with others who have experienced issues using Clickatell's API.</p>  <p>We would like to use Clickatell to verify phone numbers of subscribers at the time of registration (just like Whatsapp or Line, which are both Clickatell's clients).</p>  <p>The problem we are facing is SMS to various phone numbers are reported by Clickatell to be received by recipients, however they do not actually reach those recipients. For certain numbers it works, for many others it does not (even if on the same phone network).</p>  <p>It has been 3 weeks since we submitted this issue to Clickatell, but it is not getting resolved. If anyone here has met such issue and could share with us, that would be very much appreciated.</p>
