<p>In the below script, which was written by an unknown third party, the only changes I've made were changing the value of $to, $from, and $body from hard-coded strings to $_GET elements. The aim of the project is to pass some parameters to this script in a query string, and then compose and send and SMS message with it.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  /**** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** ****   * sms.php   *   * sample PHP code to send an SMS message to a registered   * extension on a FreeBX 12 server   *   * version history  *    2015-09-22   version 0 by lgaetz@sangoma.com  **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** ****/  // Load the FreeBPX bootstrap, requires FreePBX 12 if (!@include_once(getenv('FREEPBX_CONF') ? getenv('FREEPBX_CONF') : '/etc/freepbx.conf')) {     include_once('/etc/asterisk/freepbx.conf'); }  // The Asterisk Manager Class from the boostrap is $astman  // If using FreePBX 13+ must set asman with  //  $astman = new AGI_AsteriskManager( ); if ($astman) {     // $to = "sip:#######";     // $from = '"Caller ID Name" &lt;#######&gt;';     // $body = "cats are yummy";     $to = $_GET['to'];     $from = $_GET['from'];     $body = $_GET['body'];      $result = $astman-&gt;MessageSend($to, $from, $body);      print_r($result);   //debug      // the variable $result will be an array of the formats     // Array ( [Response] =&gt; Success [Message] =&gt; Message successfully sent )     // Array ( [Response] =&gt; Error [Message] =&gt; Message failed to send. ) } else {     echo "No Asterisk Manager Connection"; } </code></pre>  <p>However, even though this script works fine with those commented-out hard-coded values, changing those values to $_GET elements results in this error message:</p>  <pre><code>Array ( [Response] =&gt; Error [Message] =&gt; Message technology not found. ) </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to find some sort of documentation to explain to me how this works... Any ideas from anyone else who's worked with FreePBX bootstrap?</p>
