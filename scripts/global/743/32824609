<p>I am trying to develop a mobile verification system for my app that use a SMS verification code. We know that iPhone applications can not read SMS data from inbox so I can not read sent SMS automatically from inbox BUT right now I installed whats app, I enter the mobile number, it shows a connecting page and send verified my app.</p>  <p>My question is that what whats app do? Did it reads an SMS automatically or using another scenario?</p>
