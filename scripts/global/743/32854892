<p>I am creating an application for doctors and would like to give them the option to send automatic reminders and confirmations to their patients by text message. Assuming a doctor has about 15 appointments per day and the app manages 3 doctors, that gives me 15x3x22= 9900 text messages. When sending these to for example Canada or US, I can use Twillio or Plivo where I pay $0.01/message which means I only have to charge the user about $120/year extra (the app works on a subscription basis). However, sending text messages to other countries can cost up to $0.08/message driving the price up to almost $1000. And this is using only a very nodest estimate of the users actual needs.</p>  <p>Thus the main problem is: For large amounts of text messages it seems I would have to have a text message license for around $4000/year when the license for the app itself costs only about $250/tear.</p>  <p>The question then is, is there a cheaper alternative to services like Twillio and Plivo? Would it be worth it programming a custom SMS gateway? Or are there any other, cheaper services?</p>  <p>I use Parse Cloud Code for all text messages to keep my access codes secret so I am not limited to Objective-C</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
