<p>I'm using pygsm to receive sms from python, to store into the database. But when an email address is received, it appears as "thisemail\x00gmail.com". And therefore, it stores </p>  <pre><code>thisemail\x00gmail.com </code></pre>  <p>into the database. How do i make it so that it stores </p>  <pre><code>thisemail@gmail.com </code></pre>  <p>I've been trying it for days by replacing and splitting the string.. </p>
