<p>I receive SMS in my app:</p>  <pre><code>public class SMSMonitor extends BroadcastReceiver {     private static final String ACTION = "android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED";      @Override     public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {         if (intent != null &amp;&amp; intent.getAction() != null &amp;&amp; ACTION.compareToIgnoreCase(intent.getAction()) == 0) {             Object[] pduArray = (Object[]) intent.getExtras().get("pdus");             SmsMessage[] messages = new SmsMessage[pduArray.length];             for (int i = 0; i &lt; pduArray.length; i++) {                 messages[i] = SmsMessage.createFromPdu((byte[]) pduArray[i]);             }             StringBuilder bodyText = new StringBuilder();             for (SmsMessage message : messages) {                 bodyText.append(message.getMessageBody());             }             String body = bodyText.toString();             Observer.getInstance().send(new SmsEvent(body));             abortBroadcast();         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>And after that i want send this SMS to my Server. And if i receive "OK" status from server, i want delete this mesage on phone.  Problem: If i receive SMS in BroadcastReceiver i receive this SMS in android system too. I see two way:</p>  <ol> <li>When i receive SMS in BroadcastReceiver - save this sms in local DB and faund dublicate this SMS in Android inbox and delete it. When Server receive "OK" status, clear SMS in DB. if status "ERROR" - send again this SMS while not status "OK"</li> <li>Not save SMS in Local DB. If i receive SMS in BroadcastReceiver - sent it to server and if server status "OK" -> faund SMS in Androis inbox and delete it. if status "ERROR" - send again this SMS while not status "OK"  <ol start="3"> <li>Disable receive SMS in Android inbox after receive in BroadcastReceiver and use firsy way. I've heard that you can manage the queue SMS messages in android. Is it true?</li> </ol></li> </ol>
