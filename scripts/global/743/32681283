<p>My app needs to use a "READ_SMS" permission only. My problem is that on Android 6.0 When I need to use the new permission system it asks a "send and view SMS messages" from the user.</p>  <p>This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(getActivity(), new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_SMS}, READ_SMS_PERMISION_REQ); </code></pre>  <p>What is going on? Thanks!</p>
