<p>My customers are not receiving SMS to verify their OTP. We have integrated Twilio with Parse and is using it for OTP Authentication. We are based out of India. </p>  <p>We faced this during test account. It never used to send SMS in the night and received all SMS next day morning. Now we are using a paid account and still the same issue i.e. my customer did not get any SMS during night and also not in the morning. Kindly help. </p>  <p>We will not be able to do business if our customers  do not receive OTP SMS. </p>  <p>Is this a known issue ? </p>
