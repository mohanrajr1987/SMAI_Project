<p>I have a <a href="https://groupme.com/" rel="nofollow">GroupMe</a> contact on my Android phone which I get messages from all the time. It is really annoying, so I can either #mute text the GroupMe server and stop getting messages or mute my phone vibrations altogether. The problem with these solutions is that I don't want to completely mute the messages from the server altogether. I want to be able to read them when I decide to. I also don't want to mute my phone altogether because then I can't tell if someone else tried to text me.</p>  <p>I tried searching online for help on the topic and I came across the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ac.vibration&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Contact Vibrate</a> application. It had a bunch of features and seemed pretty messy in organization. You could set custom vibrate patterns for each of your contacts. I noticed that it had plenty of default vibrate patterns, but none that just vibrated once and none that vibrated zero times. I tried to create one that didn't vibrate, but that didn't work. I ended up deleting the app altogether.</p>  <p>I still haven't found a way to silence the vibrate messages for that specific contact while allowing the messages themselves to be received. Solution?</p>
