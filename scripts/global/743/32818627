<p>I need a web based system which generates report based on SMS's. </p>  <p>The generally used method for this will be get a long code provider. However I am thinking of creating a Android App which resides on a mobile with a sim card, and using that number as the long code. </p>  <p>So users can send SMS to this particular number which the android app reads and sends it to my server. After which the SMS is deleted from the mobile.</p>  <p>I would like to know if there are any drawbacks of creating a system like this.</p>
