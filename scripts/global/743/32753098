<p>I am stuck with a problem with Kannel. I have one SMSC (with one IP and port) but I have 2 user accounts for it. The problem is that I can't set up both user accounts for one SMSC in Kannel (only one connection.) Currently I'm setting each user account in a separate connection (2 connections.) I want to run both accounts on one smsc group in case one of them dies. How can I use two accounts with one connection?</p>
