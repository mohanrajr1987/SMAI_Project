<p>Is there any ruby gem which can be used to see Facebook post in rails app, also allows to post through rails app. I tried this gem <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/ruby-social-gems-facebook/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitepoint.com/ruby-social-gems-facebook/</a> but it is not showing facebook page post.</p>
