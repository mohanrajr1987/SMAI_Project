You may need to specify the path to the library's headers and libraries to continue.  You can do this by adding a -- between RubyGems' options and the extension's build options:    $ gem install some_extension_gem   [build fails]   Gem files will remain installed in \   /path/to/gems/some_extension_gem-1.0 for inspection.
