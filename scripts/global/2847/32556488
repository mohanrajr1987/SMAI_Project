<p>How can I install a particular gem and also specify that I want the <code>gem</code> command to use a particular version on one of its dependencies?</p>  <p>My case is trying to install Rails 4.2.x on Windows using Cygwin.  The problem is that Rails 4.2.x (on Windows+Cygwin) requires nokogiri 1.6.7 which is in RC but more or less stable I assume.  I installed that with:</p>  <pre><code>gem install nokogiri -v 1.6.7.rc3 --pre </code></pre>  <p>This completes successfully, but afterward when I try to install rails:</p>  <pre><code>gem install rails -v 4.2.0 </code></pre>  <p>It errors out with trying to build nokogiri 1.6.6.2</p>  <pre><code>Building native extensions.  This could take a while... ... Makefile:238: recipe for target 'nokogiri.o' failed ... Gem files will remain installed in /path/to/gems/nokogiri-1.6.6.2 for inspection. Results logged to /path/to/extensions/x86_64-cygwin/nokogiri-1.6.6.2/gem_make.out </code></pre>  <p>The compilation problem is already <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nokogiri-talk/BigaPrf2AwE" rel="nofollow">known</a> and the solution is to use nokogiri 1.6.7.</p>
