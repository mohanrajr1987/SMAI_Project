<p>I'm currently writing a ruby script that will make changes to excel documents based off of certain criteria's I set. I've been using the ruby gem 'roo' to do the reading aspect of the script but haven't been able to find a suitable writer. I've tried RubyXL and spreadsheet but I haven't been able to get them to work. Is there a simpler alternative to writing or a better gem to use out there for writing to excel? </p>
