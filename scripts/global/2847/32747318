<p>I had a few images on my website that were over 1MB so I compressed them and uploaded them to the server (replaced them using same names, in app/assets). I also deleted the images that were previously generated in /public/assets.</p>  <p>In my index.html.erb I use the image like <code>header/logo.png</code></p>  <p>However in my browser, the image name is always for example <code>logo-d19a42b2a0872961c14523505539a29c.png</code> (same name as before) and the same 1MB size as the previous image. I cleared cache / cookies. Weirdly, on the server if I do <code>find . -name "logo-d19a42b2a0872961c14523505539a29c.png"</code> there is nothing found.</p>  <p>Is that normal rails behavior? What should I do to fix that?</p>
