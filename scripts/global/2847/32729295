<p>I have just started working with Ruby. I am trying to install a gem with local file system as source. </p>  <pre><code>$gem source *** CURRENT SOURCES *** file:///home/fox/shared/ </code></pre>  <p>when i try to install 'bundler' gem it actually installs 'bundler-unload' gem as below.</p>  <pre><code>$gem install bundler --bindir /usr/bin --no-ri --no-rdoc Successfully installed bundler-unload-1.0.2 1 gem installed </code></pre>  <p>the directory contains both the gems by the way.</p>  <pre><code>bundler-unload-1.0.2.gem bundler-1.10.6.gem </code></pre>  <p>Is there anything that I am missing here. Why would it install the wrong gem?</p>
