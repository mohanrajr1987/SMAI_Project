<p>I messed up my configuration. I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and had some issues when I tried to move from a project to an other. I tried to uninstall and reinstall rbenv and then installed Ruby 2.1.7 following this guide: <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04" rel="nofollow">https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04</a>.</p>  <p>Now, when I run <code>gem install bundler</code> nothing happens and I can't install any gems. When I type <code>bundler</code> or <code>bundler -v</code> I see this: </p>  <pre><code>/usr/local/bin/bundler: /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1: bad interpreter: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>I spent many hours trying to solve this but I really don't know what to do.</p>
