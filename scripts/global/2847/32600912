<p>I am working on a rails website and I need to make it multilingual. I have created yml files for the languages needed for translation.</p>  <p>What I want is to provide the Admin access to files to edit them instead of browsing through the files, by a section in Admin panel. Is there any gem for managing translations through Admin end. </p>  <p>I have never implemented translations before.</p>
