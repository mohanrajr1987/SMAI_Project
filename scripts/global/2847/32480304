<p>Say one creates a repo, adds the necessary code, pushes the repo to GitHub, builds the gem via <code>gem build</code> and then pushes it to RubyGems via <code>gem push</code>. So far, so good. What is then the process to update the gem? What I mean is the following:</p>  <ul> <li>If I make changes to the code and push them to GitHub is there an automatic way for RubyGems to detect the changes or do I need to run <code>gem build/push</code> again?</li> <li>Do I need to change the gem version on every git commit? I am aware of <a href="http://semver.org/" rel="nofollow">semantic versioning</a>, but what if I make changes, that are not related to the code of the gem directly, such as edits to the README, the .gemspec file etc.</li> </ul>  <p>So to sum it up - what is the workflow for maintaining a gem with regard to pushes to GitHub and RubyGems?</p>
