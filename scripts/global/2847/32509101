<p>I'm developing a web site with Topic, Subtopic and Article models. Users are able to sign up (devise gem) and create topics, subtopics under topics and articles under subtopics.</p>  <p>What I want to do is, a user should be able to invite an other user (member or not)  - to show and edit a Topic with all the subtopics and articles,  - OR to edit only a subtopic to show and edit all the articles  - OR to edit only one article.</p>  <p>At this point, seems like I can use devise_invitable gem for inviting. But how can I show this invited user only the permitted objects?</p>  <p>Is there any gem or something to manage the application like this?</p>
