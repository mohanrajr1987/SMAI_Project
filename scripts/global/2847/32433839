<p>So I was successful in writing a jruby file and reading from a jar file.</p>  <p>I also created a seperate Ruby gem, installed it and used it successfully.</p>  <p>I would like to write a gem using Jruby (and not ruby). When I did try to do so and after installing the gem, it gave me the following error:</p>  <pre><code>  `require': cannot load such file -- java (LoadError) </code></pre>  <p>Is there a specific way to write a gem using jruby that is different from the way to write a gem usig ruby? If so, please direct me to a useful tutorial that helps me create a gem using jruby</p>  <p>thank you.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>I added the following to the jruby_gem.gemspec file</p>  <pre><code>s.platform = 'java' </code></pre>  <p>Built the gem using the command:</p>  <pre><code>gem build jruby_gem.gemspec </code></pre>  <p>and installed it using the command:</p>  <pre><code>gem install jruby_gem-0.0.0 </code></pre>  <p>And when I tried to run it using the commands:</p>  <pre><code>irb require 'jrubt_gem' </code></pre>  <p>I still got the same error.</p>
