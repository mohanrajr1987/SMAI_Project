<p>Context: I ran <code>gem uninstall --all</code> in a "scorched-earth" attempt to debug a persistent Capybara error I was experiencing.  My plan was to then run <code>bundle install</code> in the folder where my Gemfile is, and re-install the necessary gems with their correct versions.  However, running that command resulted in the following:</p>  <pre><code>Could not find addressable-2.3.6 in any of the sources </code></pre>  <p>So I attempted to install the <code>addressable</code> gem by itself (i.e. <code>gem install addressable</code>), and that seemed to work fine.  However when I re-ran <code>bundle install</code>, I got the following:</p>  <pre><code>Could not find websocket-driver-0.3.4 in any of the sources </code></pre>  <p>Attempting the same strategy (<code>gem install websocket-driver</code>) resulted in the following:</p>  <pre><code>Fetching: websocket-driver-0.3.4.gem (100%) Building native extensions.  This could take a while... ERROR:  Error installing websocket-driver: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.  /Users/richiethomas/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p547/bin/ruby extconf.rb  creating Makefile  make  clean  make compiling websocket_mask.c make: *** [websocket_mask.o] Segmentation fault: 11  make failed, exit code 2  Gem files will remain installed in /Users/richiethomas/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p547/gems/websocket-driver-0.3.4 for inspection.

I can't be sure though, because I don't know what a "make" is, or why it failed (according to the .out file).</p>  <p>UPDATE: I tried running <code>xcode-select --install</code> from the command line, hoping this would solve any potential compilation errors, but no joy.</p>
