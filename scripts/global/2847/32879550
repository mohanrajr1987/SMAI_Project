Though I went through different stackoverflow answers, I could not find anything specific which would fix my error. </p>  <p>I tried reinstalling lower version of the railites gem but the same error keeps popping. I tried reinstalling all the gems that were throwing errors and still the problem doesnt seem to go away. Many articles indicated that this is a compatibility issue. But when I tried reinstalling a lower version of the railties gem(4.0.0), the command prompt still asked me to upgrade to the latest version in order to continue. I also installed 'Passenger' web server to check the compatibility and a similar error popped up but this time with the passenger gem. Please look into this accordingly. I am also copying below the gem file.</p>  <pre><code># Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails' gem 'rails', '4.2.4' # Use mysql as the database for Active Record gem 'mysql2' #Bundle for Passenge r web server gem 'passenger' # Use SCSS for stylesheets #gem 'sass-rails', '~&gt; 5.0' # Use Uglifier as compressor for JavaScript assets  #gem 'uglifier', '&gt;= 1.3.0' gem 'rack', '~&gt; 1.6.0' gem 'rspec-rails', :group =&gt; [:development, :test] # Use CoffeeScript for .coffee assets and views  #gem 'coffee-rails', '~&gt; 4.1.0' # See https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes # gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby  # Use jquery as the JavaScript library  #gem 'jquery-rails' # Turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster.
