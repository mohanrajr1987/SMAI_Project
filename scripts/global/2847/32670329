<p>So, I've added the mysql2 gem by pasting the following line in my gemfilegem 'mysql2', '~> 0.4.1'</p>  <p>But I get an error saying :</p>  <p>Specified 'mysql2' for database adapter, but the gem is not loaded. Add <code>gem 'mysql2'</code> to your Gemfile (and ensure its version is at the minimum required by ActiveRecord).</p>  <p>I even tried using gem install mysql2, but i get the following error: unable to download data from <a href="https://rubygems.org/" rel="nofollow">https://rubygems.org/</a></p>  <p>I changed the "https" to "http" in the gemfile, cause this solution seemed to work for a friend. But it doesn't seem to work for me.</p>  <p>This is what my database.yml file looks like:</p>  <pre><code>default: &amp;default   adapter: mysql2   encoding: utf8   username: root   password:    host: localhost   pool: 5   timeout: 5000 </code></pre>  <p>TIA</p>
