<p>I would like to find a quick simple way to create unique array combinations from existing array values.</p>  <p>Lets say I have 2 arrays.</p>  <p><strong>Array 1</strong></p>  <pre><code>[1, 5, 10] </code></pre>  <p><strong>Array 2</strong></p>  <pre><code>[2, 3] </code></pre>  <p>I would like to create unique combination arrays from both arrays.  </p>  <p><strong>Desired output</strong></p>  <pre><code>[1, 2], [5, 2], [10, 2], [3, 1], [3, 5], [3, 10] </code></pre>  <p>Besides iterating over each array and creating arrays, is there a better way to approach this?  Please let me know if more information is needed.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any guidance provided.</p>
