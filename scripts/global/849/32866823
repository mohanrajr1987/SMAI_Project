<p>Let me explain what I'm trying to do first. I want to try and format the changes in groovy and write it to a file.  I know I can use mercurial to do this but I would prefer not to have Mercurial generate the changes file.  </p>  <p>Here is what I'm trying based on the answers in the following locations  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10413936/creating-a-jenkins-environment-variable-using-groovy">Creating a Jenkins environment variable using Groovy</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21236268/access-to-build-environment-variables-from-a-groovy-script-in-a-jenkins-build-st">Access to build environment variables from a groovy script in a Jenkins build step ( Windows)</a></p>  <p>And here is what I'm trying to do.</p>  <pre><code>import hudson.model.* def job = Hudson.instance.getJob('MYProjectName') def run = job.getLastBuild() def Environment = run.getEnvironment()  println(Environment['CHANGES_SINCE_LAST_SUCCESS']) </code></pre>  <p>I'm getting NULL as a result, and I'm assuming this is because CHANGES_SINCE_LAST_SUCCESS Is a token and not a variable.  Is there a way to get changes in Groovy</p>
