<p>I am trying to get userid who approved an "input" step in workflow jenkins groovy script. Below is the sample script</p>  <pre><code>node('node1'){     stage "test"      input  message: 'test' } </code></pre>  <p>In the workflow UI if a person hits "thumbs up" I want to print his userid in the log. I dont see any option to do it.</p>  <pre><code>def cause = currentBuild.rawBuild.getCause(Cause.UserIdCause) cause.userId  </code></pre>  <p>will print the person who started the build. I have googled this for days but i am not finding anything. Any help here will be greatly appreciated :)</p>
