<p>In Java/C++, you can introduce subscopes, useful if you have copy-pasta code that you really don't want to change: </p>  <pre><code>public void function() {      Map&lt;String, Person&gt; ...      {         Person obj ...        ...        map.add(obj)    }    {         Person obj ...        ...        map.add(obj)    }  } </code></pre>  <p>Only to avoid stupid repetition errors where you forget to change variable1 to variable2.  I'm primarily using this in testcases.  </p>  <p>In Groovy, however, this creates closures, and does not behave in the same fashion.  Is there a Groovy way to do this I'm missing? </p>
