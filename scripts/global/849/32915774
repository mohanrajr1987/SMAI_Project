<p>I have a string that needs to read from the database and sent as JSON. How can I make sure all quotes are escaped properly and handle any other characters that might make the String invalid JSON?</p>  <p>So for example I have the following code..</p>  <pre><code>def jsonFormatted = new groovy.json.JsonBuilder(products:finalList).toPrettyString() </code></pre>  <p>And finalList variable is an array of HashMaps, where each Map has a key value pair, for example..</p>  <pre><code>   "Product Id" -&gt; "555"    "Product Name" -&gt; "32" Flat Screen TV" </code></pre>  <p>Because that open quote in product name is not escaped, the program which reads the JSON on the other end breaks. </p>  <p>Any solution that uses JsonBuilder or JsonSlurper libraries would be optimal.</p>
