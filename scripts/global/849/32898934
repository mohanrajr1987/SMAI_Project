<p>I am trying to make a call to a stored function in Oracle.  This function not only has a return value but also has an OUT parameter.  I am relatively new to Groovy but have a lot of database experience.  How do I retrieve the actual values returned.  Here is my sample call...assume I already have a good database connection.</p>  <p>I have a store function with the following signature:</p>  <pre><code>GET_JOB(job_id IN VARCHAR2, max_sal OUT INTEGER) RETURNS VARCHAR2 </code></pre>  <p>I make the call in groovy:</p>  <pre><code>def result = sql.call("{? = call get_job(?, ?)}", [Sql.VARCHAR, 'TE', Sql.NUMERIC]) </code></pre>  <p>This seems to run with no errors, but I am unclear as to how to retrieve the return value and the OUT parameter (second parameter)</p>
