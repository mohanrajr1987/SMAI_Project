<p>I'm using regular expressions in Groovy to extract a substring.</p>  <pre><code>def s = "my string ....."; def r = "my regex..."; def m = s=~r;  println m[0].toString(); </code></pre>  <p>In the last code line I have seen that result is printed between "[" and "]". Something like this:</p>  <p>[my result...]</p>  <p>I don't want to print "[" and "]".</p>  <p>How can I do this?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>Thanks to the Oliver Charlesworth's reply, I have the solution.</p>  <p>Last code line should be something like this:</p>  <pre><code>println m[0][0].toString(); </code></pre>
