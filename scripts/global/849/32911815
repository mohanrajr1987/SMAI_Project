<p>I have a Servlet Filter which performs operations before and after the filter chain, something like:</p>  <pre><code>public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain){     // I do some stuff here...      chain.doFilter(req, res);      // ... and then I do some more stuff here. } </code></pre>  <p>I am converting this to a Ratpack application and have figured out how to use Handlers as filters (in general)</p>  <pre><code>class MyHandler implements Handler {     void handle(Context ctx){         // so some stuff...          context.next()     } } </code></pre>  <p>but the call to <code>next()</code> is non blocking so the followup operations are performed right away rather than after the other handlers have executed. </p>  <p>How can I get this before and after code behavior in Ratpack?</p>
