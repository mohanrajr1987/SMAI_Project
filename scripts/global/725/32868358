<p>I am trying to setup Symfony2 on a dev server and want the folder structure to look like:</p>  <p>/var/www/Symfony2</p>  <p>/var/www/Site1/</p>  <p>/var/www/Site2/</p>  <p>That way every site on the server shares the same Symfony2 framework and if we ever upgrade the framework then all sites will upgrade. If we create a new site then there will be no framework setup, you can just copy a site and move on.</p>  <p>Is this possible and is there an example to look at? Thanks in advance.</p>
