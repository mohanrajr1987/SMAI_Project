<p>Problem: I installed nginx + passenger on my local computer, but I can't connect my rails project to nginx. Here's what I did:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I've installed nginx + passenger using brew, as instructed here: <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/nginx/install/oss/osx/" rel="nofollow">https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/nginx/install/oss/osx/</a></p></li> <li><p>I edited the config file (under /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf) to the following:</p>  <pre><code>http {     passenger_root /usr/local/opt/passenger/libexec/lib/phusion_passenger/locations.ini;     passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby;     ...      server {         listen 3000;         server_name localhost;         rails_env development;         root /absolute/path/to/rails/project/public         passenger_enabled on;     }      location / {         root html;         index index.html index.htm;     }      ... } </code></pre></li> <li><p>Then I start nginx by typing "nginx" in terminal</p></li> <li><p>Now when I go to localhost:3000, all I get is the default "Welcome to nginx!" page. What I expect to see is my home root page. </p></li> </ol>  <p>Questions <br> - What am I doing wrong? aka, why is the rails project not showing? <br> - Any recommendations for troubleshooting?</p>  <p>Note <br> - localhost:3000 works if I'm run "rails server" (webrick) <br> - Running Rails 3.2.19, ruby 2.1.4, nginx 1.8, Phusion Passenger 5.0.18.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
