<p>I'm new on Linux/monitoring and try my best :) So I set up the latest Icinga2 with Icinga2 Web on Ubuntu. All seems good to work. Now I'm trying to integrate a windows host.</p>  <p>These Steps I did:</p>  <ol> <li>edit the <code>icinga.conf</code> and added <code>include &lt;windows-plugins&gt;</code></li> <li>installed the Icinga client on Windows (7)</li> <li>Generated a Setup Ticket for the client on Icinga</li> <li>executed <code>sudo icinga2 node update-config</code> on icinga</li> </ol>  <p>My host appears on icinga but there are no thresholds for example at the CPU load. On <code>/usr/share/icinga2/include/command-plugins-windows.conf</code> are thresholds defined.</p>  <p>Why they do not working?</p>  <p>For each host icinga2 creates a new entry for host and service in the repository <code>/etc/icinga2/repository.d/hosts/PC-01.Domain.local</code></p>  <p>For each services there is an *.conf that looks like:</p>  <pre><code>object Service "load" {     import "satellite-service"     check_command = "dummy"     host_name = "PC-01.Domain.local"     zone = "PC-01.Domain.local" } </code></pre>  <p>The check_command seems not to be the right one. It should be "loads-windows". But why does it work?</p>
