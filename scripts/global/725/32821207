<p>I am currently using sails.js with ejs templating but wish to switch to nunjucks. I have done this with no problems.</p>  <p>I have found however that the tags of nunjucks are the same as that of angularjs and wish to change them.</p>  <p>I have look at the documentation here: <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#customizing-syntax" rel="nofollow">https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#customizing-syntax</a></p>  <p>I don't know how to do this in a sails.js context.</p>  <p>I have tried adding a 'tags' setting to config / view.js.</p>  <p>I've tried running the configure command in bootstrap.js.</p>  <p>Could anybody help me out with this please?</p>
