<p>In production mode play (version 1.2.6) writes compiled class files into the  <code>app/tmp/bytecode</code> and <code>app/tmp/classes</code> folder.</p>  <p>It seems like those files are never cleaned up and not recycled per request.  After a few hours runtime the disk of my ec2-box is full with gigabytes of class files.</p>  <p>What am I supposed to do? Is there a config option I missed? </p>  <p>Do I have to clean the tmp folder myself with a cron job? If so, is it safe to delete the class files while the system is running?</p>
