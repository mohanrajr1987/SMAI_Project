But after I uploaded it to File manager , nothing changes.What do I need to do to make it work ?</p>  <p>I've been searching for configuration files to set <code>AllowOverride All</code> but I didn't found anything.And also I don't have <code>etc/apache2/</code> directory in my file manager, there are other files in <code>etc/</code> directory.</p>  <p>EDIT: Server info :</p>  <p>Hosting Package:Startup2013</p>  <p>Server Name:    wolf</p>  <p>cPanel Version: 11.50.1 (build 3)</p>  <p>Theme:  paper_lantern</p>  <p>Apache Version: 2.4.16</p>  <p>PHP Version:    5.6.12</p>  <p>MySQL Version:  5.6.23</p>  <p>Architecture:   x86_64</p>  <p>Operating System:   linux</p>  <p>Shared IP Address:  185.81.0.40</p>  <p>Path to Sendmail:   /usr/sbin/sendmail</p>  <p>Path to Perl:   /usr/bin/perl</p>  <p>Perl Version:   5.10.1</p>  <p>Kernel Version: 2.6.32-573.3.1.el6.x86_64</p>  <p>Here is my <code>.htaccess</code> code : </p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.html [NC,L] </code></pre>
