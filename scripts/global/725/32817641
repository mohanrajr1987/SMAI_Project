<p>I am all new to Apache mod_rewrite, RewriteRule and regexp. I'm trying to do this:</p>  <p>All requests to <a href="http://x.y.com/path/" rel="nofollow">http://x.y.com/path/</a>* shall go to <a href="http://x.z.com/path/" rel="nofollow">http://x.z.com/path/</a>*</p>  <p>One (potential) problem here is that both x.y.com and x.z.com are ServerAlias(es) on the same Apache instance.</p>  <p>Background: We are using eZ Publish and need to redirect certain URLs from a mobile design to a "full" browser based design. We do not have responsive design so we are bound to use two different designs that matches host.</p>  <p>We do not do any redirects based on browser because we want the ability for the users to view both sites.</p>
