<p>The same problem which is occuring in this question is happening a lot to me: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19767894/warning-do-not-access-superglobal-post-array-directly-on-netbeans-7-4-for-ph">Warning &quot;Do not Access Superglobal $_POST Array Directly&quot; on Netbeans 7.4 for PHP</a></p>  <p>However - of course I take care with $_POST and user input etc. but I do this with custom functions which NetBeans does not understand and therefore my IDE is full of warnings.</p>  <p>Another annoying example: "Too many nested blocks in function declaration". Of course you should avoid that, but I think this is not always possible.</p>  <p>How can I disable single warnings in the Netbeans IDE while still keeping all other warnings?</p>
