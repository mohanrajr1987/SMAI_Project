<p>In <code>wildfly</code> currently I've found that logs can be rotated either by time or by filesize. With the last option there is a <code>rotate-on-boot</code> configuration property, that if set to true will rotate on each boot of the server.</p>  <p>Is there an already supported option to mix both rotating by time and rotate on each boot of the application server? Now we use a custom script that makes rotation on each Wildfly startup. I'm looking for an easier solution.</p>
