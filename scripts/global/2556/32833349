<p>so after a bunch of trial and error, I'm pretty sure this is what it's supposed to be. </p>  <pre><code>type ('a,'b) dict3 = ('a -&gt; 'b option)  let empty3 : unit -&gt; ('a,'b) dict3 =  fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt;  None);;  let put3 : 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; ('a,'b) dict3 -&gt; ('a,'b) dict3 = fun key value dict -&gt; fun x -&gt; if x = key then Some value else dict x;;  let get3 : 'a -&gt; ('a,'b) dict3 -&gt; 'b option = fun key dict -&gt; dict key;; </code></pre>  <p>But now that I have this, I'm very confused how they communicate with one another. I tried doing a test for get3, and I came up with:</p>  <pre><code>let _ = assert (get3 42 (fun lst -&gt; Some (String.length "charizard")) = Some 9);; </code></pre>  <p>which I think is correct. But I don't know how to write an assert case for put3, as I don't know how to show the ('a, 'b) dict3, nor how to get empty3 to return None.</p>
