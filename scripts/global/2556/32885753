<p>I'm a beginner-intermediate self taught Python developer, </p>  <p>In most of the projects I completed, I can see the following procedure repeats. I don't have any outside home code experiences, I think the below code is not so professional as it is not reusable, and seems like it is not fitting all together in a container, but loosely coupled functions on different modules.</p>  <pre><code>def get_query():     # returns the query string     pass  def make_request(query):     # makes and returns the request with query     pass  def make_api_call(request):     # calls the api and returns response     pass  def process_response(response):     # process the response and returns the details     pass  def populate_database(details):     # populates the database with the details and returns the status of population     pass  def log_status(status):     # logs the status so that developer knows whats happening     pass  query = get_query() request = make_request(query) response = make_api_call(request) details = process_response(response) status = populate_database(details) log_status(status) </code></pre>  <p>How do I design this procedure as a class based design?</p>
