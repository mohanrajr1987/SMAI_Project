<p>I'm learning about monads, which, as I understand, work with a series of composed functions, encapsulating side-effects or contingencies that arise from some data values.</p>  <p>Is there an equivalent for a "semi-ordered lattice"?</p>  <p>What I mean is this.</p>  <p>Say I have some functions which are basically modelling the flow in a routing network. </p>  <p>Eg. </p>  <pre><code>a = f(x) b = g(x) c = h(b) d = i(c) e = j(a,d) </code></pre>  <p>etc.</p>  <p>Can something monad-like be used to manage possibilities of optional results, thrown errors or side-effects. j(a,d) is taking two of my "monadic values" ... eg. either of which Maybe nothing.</p>
