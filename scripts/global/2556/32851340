<p>So in working on a Haskell project, I've ended up writing the following function</p>  <pre><code>reGrid :: [[[a]]] -&gt; [[a]] reGrid [] = [] reGrid xs | any null xs = []           | otherwise = (concat $ map head xs) : reGrid (map tail xs) </code></pre>  <p>For those who don't speak Haskell, this takes a list of matrices, and joins the corresponding rows into a new matrix.</p>  <p>Its popped up several times in this project, and I the feeling that this is some kind of common operation that I've missed.</p>  <p>Is there a standard name for this operation? Searching Hoogle for</p>  <pre><code>[[[a]]] -&gt; [[a] </code></pre>  <p>Yields nothing useful.</p>
