<p>Good day, </p>  <p>Recently i thought about make some automation for my daily work and make it easier. So first of all i thought which lang will be much suitable for me to start to learn. So i'm stuck on this point, i search in internet, surfed lot of forums, and a lot of people talking about Java, Python,Visual Basic,  even PHP. But i didn't find the exact solution which i'm looking for. </p>  <p>So, my target is to make a program which should work though web. Why web ? because i'm using a different OS on different machines (WINDOWS, LINUX, MAC) So, web is perfect choice for me. I want to put some buttons on this page which will be like Check and next on it there should be values like . Choose VRRP, Choose Number, and when you'll write all the values, the program should send commands via ssh and execute them on device and show output on web page. </p>  <p>I'm newbie in this domain, so if you could help me please explain it step by step. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance all of you.  Have a great day.. </p>
