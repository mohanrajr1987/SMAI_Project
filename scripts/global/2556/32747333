<p>I've been reading lots of articles on currying, but almost all of them are misleading, explaining currying as a partial function application and all of examples usually are about functions with arity of 2, like <code>add</code> function or something.</p>  <p>Also many implementations of <code>curry</code> function in JavaScript makes it to accept more than 1 argument per partial application (see <a href="https://lodash.com/docs#curry">lodash</a>), when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">Wikipedia article</a> clearly tells that currying is about:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments (or a tuple of arguments) into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument (partial application)</p> </blockquote>  <p>So basically currying is a series of partial applications each with a single argument. And I really want to know real uses of that, in any language.</p>
