<pre><code>power &lt;- function(exp) {   function(x) {     x ^ exp   } } funlist &lt;- lapply(2:3, power) </code></pre>  <p>Now I would expect that the first element of 'funlist' is a square function and the second is a cube function. However it seems like it just repeats the 'cubing'.</p>  <pre><code>&gt; funlist[[1]](5) [1] 125 &gt; funlist[[2]](5) [1] 125 </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way to generate a list of functions from a closure in this way? Or general best practices surrounding a problem that I may want to approach in this way?</p>
