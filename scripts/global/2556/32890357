<p>Suppose I had the following two lists:     let a = [1;2;3;4];;     let b = [1;3;5;7];; and I wanted a third list containing the index-wise sum of a and b; i.e     let c = [2;5;8;11];;</p>  <p>The question is how would I do this using only functions from List.fold_right, List.fold_left and/or List.map?  (This is a homework problem, so I'm not allowed to use recursive functions or @.)</p>
