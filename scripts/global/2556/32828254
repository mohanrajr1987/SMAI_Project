<p>I know and love my <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code>, which happen to be part of more and more languages that are not really purely functional.</p>  <p>I found myself needing a similar function though: something like <code>map</code>, but instead of one to one it would be one to many.</p>  <p>I.e. one element of the original list might be mapped to multiple elements in the target list. </p>  <p>Is there already something like this out there or do I have to roll my own?</p>
