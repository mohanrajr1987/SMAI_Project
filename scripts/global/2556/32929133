<p>Write a function called FooBar that takes input integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 upto n in a new line. If the number is divisible by 3 then print "Foo", if the number is divisible by 5 then print "Bar" and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FooBar". Otherwise just print the number.  for example FooBar(15) should print as follows: </p>  <pre><code>1  2  Foo  4  Bar  Foo  7  8  Foo  Bar  11  Foo  13  14  FooBar  </code></pre>  <p>Guys PLZ PLZ PLZ give me the complete answer in RUBY!!! i am using an online cloud computing environment to write code and I need this answer to a quiz ASAP!!! So far I have been able to get the numbers to print properly but i don't know how to loop them.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Blockquote</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>puts "Please enter a number" val1 = gets.to_i val2 = val1 % 3 val3 = val1 % 5   def ordinal(a,b,c)     if b == 0 &amp;&amp; c == 0         return "foobar"     elsif    b == 0         return "foo"     elsif c == 0        return "bar"     else         return a     end end  val5 = ordinal(val1,val2,val3) puts "#{val5}" </code></pre>  <p>I also made a loop that works but it won't recognize strings. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Blockquote</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>n = 0 x = gets.to_i while n != x   puts "#{n}"   n = n + 1 end </code></pre>  <p>How do i combine my method and loop? Or is there any other way to solve this? But I would prefer if you solve it using my code IF its any good off course so that I can understand it better. Thanks</p>
