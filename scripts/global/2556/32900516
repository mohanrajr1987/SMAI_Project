<p>Given the following function:</p>  <pre><code>public static &lt;X&gt; List&lt;X&gt; filterWithVarargPredicates(         List&lt;X&gt; allProducts,         Predicate&lt;X&gt;... predicates     ) {         for (Predicate&lt;X&gt; predicate : predicates) {             allProducts = allProducts.stream()                 .filter(predicate)                 .collect(toList());         }          return allProducts;     } </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way to consume all the predicates without having to loop through them and re-assign to the list? For instance, it'd be great if <code>.stream()</code> had a filter that took varargs, or some way to do that within a single stream.</p>
