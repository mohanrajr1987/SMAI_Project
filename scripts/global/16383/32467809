<p>I have an <code>UINavigationController</code> which holds a viewController. This viewController presents a fullscreen, landscape-only viewController either via a button or on device rotation to landscape.</p>  <p>When using the button, the status bar disappears for portrait and the navigation bar jumps to top (that's not nice – actually quite ugly – but not the core problem).</p>  <p>When rotating the device, the portrait viewController does not only "lose" the status bar (as expected) but its navigationBar resizes to a narrow height of 35px.</p>  <p>44px in portrait <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/stz2F.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/stz2F.png" alt="navigationBar height portrait"></a></p>  <p>35px in landscape <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jpBFS.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jpBFS.jpg" alt="navigationBar height landscape"></a></p>  <p>Since the fullscreen viewController covers this, it might seem unimportant. But in my case, the content, which has some special scroll-animations, produces an unpleasant glitch that doesn't disappear after dismissal.</p>  <p>All my viewControllers implement</p>  <pre><code>- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations {     return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait | UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortraitUpsideDown; } </code></pre>  <p>except of the fullscreen-landscape-only viewController which implements</p>  <pre><code>- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations {     return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape; } </code></pre>  <p>How can I not only prevent orientation change, but also size class (??) changes?</p>
