<p>After a lot of research, i have to resign...</p>  <p>I'm working on Xcode7, and swift.</p>  <p>I have a transparent navigation bar, so when i'm scrolling on the viewcontroller (a map), i would like the back button be more visible, so with a white opaque background.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cu7IH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cu7IH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Any idea to perform that ? </p>  <p>Maybe, just to insert an image as back button.</p>
