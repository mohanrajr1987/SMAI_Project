<p>I am trying to shortcut straight to a particular view within my app from the app delegate. So far I have got to the point where the view presents with the navigation bar, however the dismiss view controller button which I have in the navigation bar doesn't do anything, and the tab bar is missing.</p>  <p>This is the code I have:</p>  <pre><code>    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)      let mainRootController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("favourites") as UIViewController     if self.window != nil {         let navigationController: UINavigationController = storyboard.instantiateInitialViewController() as! UINavigationController         navigationController.viewControllers = [mainRootController]          self.window!.rootViewController = navigationController     } </code></pre>  <p>I have an initial view controller with a hidden navigation bar which I had to add to get the above code to work (I don't want that view to have a navigation bar). I am trying to skip that initial view controller and jump to the main part of my app which has a tab bar. The favourites view is the third tab.</p>  <p>This is the layout of my storyboard (before I added the navigation bar at the entry point). I've pointed to the view controller I'm trying to get to:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NiDtL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NiDtL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
