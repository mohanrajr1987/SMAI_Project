<p>I have a modal view that I'm presenting over the current view that has a <code>UINavigationBar</code> as a subview. Everything's working great, except that the <code>UINavigationBar</code> doesn't want to behave according to the autolayout constraints. Everything else in the view behaves as desired.</p>  <p>For some reason, the left and right bar button items are cut off on the edges of the view. I inspected the view at runtime to reveal that the total width of the <code>UINavigationBar</code> is the right width, but the bar buttons aren't conforming.</p>  <p>I also checked to make sure I didn't have negative margins or some other anomaly in the constraint definitions.</p>  <p>I have also tried setting the frame of the <code>UINavigationBar</code> manually, but it yielded no improvement.</p>  <p><strong>Problematic View</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/opNWG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/opNWG.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DoNum.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DoNum.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>I'd like to keep the <code>UINavigationBar</code>, because it gets styled globally with the rest of my app (as opposed to creating a custom <code>UIView</code> imitation and styling it individually). Does anyone know what handle to jiggle to get the bar button items to conform to the right width?</p>
