<p>I have an UITabBarController that has 3 UINavigationController within. What I am trying to do, is on the push of a button on the UINavigationController's bar, to drop the bar all the way down to right above the UITabBarController's bar. I am doing this so that I can display in a pull down fashion, more content that would fill in the area above the now lowered UINavigationBar and then go away when it is moved up. So, in essence, I want to move around the UINavigationBar of a UINavigationController. I will only need this slide/up down behavior of the UINavigationBar in the root view controllers of the respective UINavigationControllers of each tab. I have tried to just reposition the bar on the UINavigation controller like so...</p>  <pre><code> @IBAction func moveBarDown(sender: AnyObject) {      self.navigationController?.navigationBar.frame = CGRect(x: 100, y: 500, width: 100, height: 100)   }     //note that I just used bogus values for demonstration purposes. </code></pre>  <p>However, I get something like this...</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PoKbj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PoKbj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see, the navigation bar extends all the way to the top even though it only has a height of 100. This leads me to believe that I am not supposed to resize and move around the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController and move it around. So, was thinking and researching some other ways of getting this same functionality. </p>  <p>1) Fake it: I was thinking that I could just programmatically insert an identical but "fake" navigation bar not connected to a UINavigationController, hide the real UINavigationBar attached to the navigation controller, and then move the fake one around as needed. Then, on the slide up, I could move "fake" navigation bar back up, unhide the real one, and then delete the "fake" navigation bar.</p>  <p>2) Implement my own sort of navigation controller: I was reading that I could use a container view to implement my own navigation controller. I am not familiar with doing such a thing, and don't even know if implementing my own UINavigationController would be a good thing to do.</p>  <p>So, my question is, how would I achieve the desired functionality of moving the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController? Is there some way that I am totally missing? Any comments, suggestions, or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>
