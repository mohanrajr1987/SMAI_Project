<p>I am trying to set the titleView to be an UIView called "navigationProfileView using the following code</p>  <pre><code>            navigationProfileView.contentMode = UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFit             navigationProfileView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleHeight             navigationItem.titleView = navigationProfileView             navigationItem.titleView?.clipsToBounds = true </code></pre>  <p>navigationProfileView is a UIView subclass with a UIImageView that is constrained to navigationProfileView bounds. The navigationProfileView is forced to be 44x44 px in its awakefromNib(). The Image that I will upload inside the imageView is really big.</p>  <p>This works like a charm, except when I am in landscape. The image stretches Length wise. Can anyone help me figure out why it stretches and how it can be fixed?</p>  <p>Thanks, Shabri</p>
