<p>I am using a custom overlay frame, on camera. On the navigation bar I have app icon in the middle and a back button on left.</p>  <p>So I would like to remove the default cancel button besides the capture button but I do not want to remove camera click button. I have done research but I did not find a perfect answer. I have already used the following code but it also removes the click button.</p>  <pre><code>[picker setShowsCameraControls:YES]; </code></pre>
