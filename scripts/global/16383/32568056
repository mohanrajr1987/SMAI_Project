<p>I need to pin a <code>UIView</code> just below the <code>UINavigationBar</code> (owned by <code>UINavigationController</code>) using Autolayout.</p>  <p>The tricky thing here is that the <code>UIView</code> needs to be a subview of the <code>UIApplication</code>'s main <code>UIWindow</code>.</p>  <p>The inserted view needs to track the position of the navigation bar, for example if the iOS status bar grows to double height (e.g. in the green "Return to call" scenario), or changes height as in landscape view.</p>  <p>The solution also needs to work with transparent <code>UINavigationBar</code>s where the view controller's <code>edgesForExtendedLayout</code> are not set to None.</p>
