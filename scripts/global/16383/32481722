<p>I have a navigation controller with a custom back button on the left.  I do this programmatically so this is not an auto-layout issue.  My problem is that the navigation controller title is not centered, it is going off the right side of the screen.  I remember seeing a fix for this awhile back dealing with setting some type of fixed space as the right bar button item, but I cannot seem to find anything similar to this now.  </p>  <p>Could someone tell me how to set the navigation controller title to centered and if the title is too big for its space, set nav bar title to fix its font size to fit the width of title space.  This all needs to be done programmatically, thanks!</p>
