<p>I've been trying to find a solution to this problem for the past two days and still nothing I have tried works for me. Some solutions I have tried either stretch or completely mess up my custom image but nothing removes the right padding. Here is my code below as well as the result. Notice how the right bar button has a bigger space than the left system one.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NNQC8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NNQC8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>    var saveButton: UIButton = UIButton(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, 32, 32))     saveButton.addTarget(self, action: "saveAction:", forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)      let img = UIImage(named: "save")     saveButton.setBackgroundImage(img, forState: .Normal)     var saveBarButton: UIBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(customView: saveButton)     self.navigationItem.setRightBarButtonItem(saveBarButton, animated: false) </code></pre>
