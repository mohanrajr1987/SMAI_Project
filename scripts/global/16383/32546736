<p>I Went through the apple documentation of UINavigation Bar but didnt find anything related to its size. How can we decrease its size from the regular size? I have changed its font and text size in the app delegate file but unable to change the size.</p>  <pre><code>UINavigationBar.appearance().tintColor = UIColor.whiteColor() UINavigationBar.appearance().titleTextAttributes = [NSForegroundColorAttributeName: UIColor.whiteColor()] </code></pre>  <p>Is there anyway to change its size?</p>
