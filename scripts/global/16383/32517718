<p>There's this very weird issue Ive run into. When presenting <strong>MFMailComposeViewController</strong> it removes/hides the navigation bar on which Cancel\Send button are shown and I'm left with just the MFMailComposeViewController without any option of coming out of it. To be honest of around 200+ times that Ive tested the app Ive only ever seen this issue come up like four or five times. Im using iPhone 4S as well as iPhone 6, both loaded with iOS 8.3. Though not regular, this occurance is more like once in a blue moon issue, extremely erratic and not at all reproducible!!</p>  <p>Following is how I'm presenting the code</p>  <pre><code>if(mailViewController)     mailViewController = nil;  mailViewController = [[MFMailComposeViewController alloc]init];  [mailViewController setMailComposeDelegate:self];  [mailViewController setToRecipients:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:sendMailto, nil]];  [mailViewController setSubject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"Report",name]];  [mailViewController addAttachmentData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:fileToAttach] mimeType:@"application/pdf" fileName:@"my_ECG_Report.pdf"];  [mailViewController setMessageBody:@"" isHTML:NO];  [self presentViewController:recievedMailComposer animated:YES completion:^{    }]; </code></pre>  <p>Things that might be help :</p>  <ul> <li>MFMailComposeViewController is tied to UIAlertAction of an UIAlertController(Action Sheet). Meaning our Mail composer will be presented only when the user taps on a button on action sheet, "<em>Send via Mail</em>" in our case.</li> <li>I'm modifying the appearance of the Navigation bar using <em>UIAppearance</em> in the app delegate</li> <li>I also have a base UINavigationController which further holds multiple child UINavigationController, one of which holds the view that presents the UIAlertController, that in turn presents the suspected UINavigationController. Please note that the Navigation bar for base UINavigationController is set to hidden. While none of the child UINavigationController have hidden navigation bar property set to TRUE.</li> </ul>  <p>If it helps, here's the code in App Delegate where I'm modifying the the navigation bar using <em>UIAppearance</em></p>  <pre><code>[[UINavigationBar appearance] setTranslucent:FALSE]; [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBarTintColor:DARK_BACKGROUND]; [[UINavigationBar appearance] setTitleTextAttributes:@{NSForegroundColorAttributeName : [UIColor whiteColor]}]; [[UIBarButtonItem appearanceWhenContainedIn:[UINavigationBar class], nil] setTintColor:[UIColor whiteColor]];  </code></pre>  <p>Things Ive tried</p>  <ul> <li>Putting delay before showing the MFMailComposeViewController.</li> <li>Remove the hidden property of the navigation bar. But like I said this bug is highly unreproducable. I do not for sure know if that going to work.  </li> </ul>  <p>Been three days I still haven't got my head around it. Any help would be appreciative. Is this a bug or something???</p>
