<p>How can I change the view controller the default navigation back button takes me to? The back button usually takes you back to the previous view controller. But what if I want it to go back by two view controllers? I mean I want to change the view controller the back button takes me to. I do not prefer creating a custom back button. So is there any other way? Probably an unwind segue linked to the back button or something?</p>
