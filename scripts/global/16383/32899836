<p>After installed the right hand bar buttons my page title become dealigned. Is there a way to realign it in the centre of the page? </p>  <p>Haven't found a way to do in with the storyboard, but I imagine that may be possible programmatically?!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A1D1C.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A1D1C.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
