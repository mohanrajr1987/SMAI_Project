<p>I've been trying to make one tab of my tab view controller show a split view controller. Here's my storyboard layout:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SDKwW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SDKwW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It all seems to be ok until I get to mysplit view controller master and detail views. They don't show the navigation bar titles until I slightly drag the screen to reveal the master (table), then they show. </p>  <p>Also it seems like the only way I can reveal the master (table view) is to drag the screen to the right, which is fine, but when the view shows I cant go back to the detail view. I've read some sites such as <a href="http://nshipster.com/uisplitviewcontroller/" rel="nofollow">this one</a> which describe methods of getting back to the master view on iPhone, but nothing seems to work.</p>  <p>I have a feeling it's something to do with my navigation controller setup, but cant put my finger on it, I'm quite new to iOS development.</p>  <p>When I get to the tab bar controller there is no nav title at all, so I've tried manually setting the navigation bar title by:</p>  <pre><code>        self.tabBarController?.navigationItem.title = "Split 2" </code></pre>  <p>But this only works when I tap on the second tab. When I initially land on the tab bar view (first tab) there's no title in the nav bar.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
