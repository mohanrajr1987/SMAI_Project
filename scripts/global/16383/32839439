<p>I've created a viewController embedded in a NavigationController. i'm then trying to present this navigationController, however it doesnt seem to show the navigationController. I've checked the Hierarchy, and it seems like it is there, but why can't i see it? i've checked that the navigationBar is set shown in interface builder. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8jejc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8jejc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("AdViewController") as! UINavigationController let detailController = vc.topViewController as! AdViewController detailController.adObject = sortedContent[indexPath.row] as? Ad self.presentViewController(vc, animated: true, completion: nil) </code></pre>
