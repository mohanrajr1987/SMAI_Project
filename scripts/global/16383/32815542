<p>In Swift, how does one override default behavior for the back button that comes with the navigation bar.  Currently, the back button behavior is to provide the left-facing chevron and then the title of the previous tableview in the stack (if it will fit on the nav bar).  However, I prefer that it always say "Back" regardless of the whether the previous tableview's title will fit on the bar or not.  As illustration:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vcClT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vcClT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>In the pic above I'd like for the "Genre Fiction" to be replaced with "Back".  </p>
