<p>I am trying to place my logo in the Navigation Bar and i followed the steps i found in other stack overflow posts and they did not work. This is the code i used</p>  <pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {     super.viewDidLoad()     // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a   nib.     let logo = UIImage(named: "logo.png")     let imageView = UIImageView(image:logo)     self.navigationItem.titleView = imageView } </code></pre>
