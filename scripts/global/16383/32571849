<p>My app has a main view with a few buttons lined up vertically. Each button is linked to a different view controller. Now, when the user taps on the first button, the first view controller is opened. Within the first view controller, there is a button which takes you directly to the second view controller. When I get to the second view controller, and press the back button, I am taken back to the first view controller. Then I have to press the back button one more time to be taken to the main view controller. What can I do to make the app take me directly to the main view controller from the second view controller, and not through the first view controller? Thanks in advance!</p>
