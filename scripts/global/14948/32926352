<p>I have an Excel spreadsheet with 4,000 rows formatted with the seven columns below. I want to key off of the first column and combine all of the matching rows. So, for the first two rows below, they would merge to one row with C2&amp;C3, F2&amp;F3, and G2&amp;G3 in a single cell in their respective columns. <strong>For example:</strong></p>  <p>8876    AIX 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2 Oracle 11.2.0.3.15 Purple,Blue Jim Smith,Bob Guy</p>  <p>Table looks like this:</p>  <p>8876    AIX 1.1.1.1 Oracle  11.2.0.3.15 Purple  Jim Smith 8876    AIX 2.2.2.2 Oracle  11.2.0.3.15 Blue    Bob Guy</p>  <p>Thanks, Chris</p>
