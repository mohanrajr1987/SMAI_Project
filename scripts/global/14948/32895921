<p>I've created a screenshot to explain what I'm searching for, it helps to understand my problem a lot better.</p>  <p><img src="http://fs5.directupload.net/images/151001/pjw463ir.jpg" alt="Sheet A"></p>  <p>What you see is "Sheet A". In the yellow field there's is a reference to "Sheet B" (something like <code>='Sheet B'!E8</code>). In the blue field I try to get the reference of the yellow field and add +4 to the row, so I'll get something like<code>='Sheet B'!I8</code>. In the red field I try to get the reference of the yellow field and add +1 to the line, so I'll get something like <code>='Sheet B'!E9</code>.</p>  <p>The goal is to just copy and paste the data sets to the right and bottom, because I've got 44 data sets to the bottom and over 350 columns to the right. The yellow cell functions like a mother cell and every other cell is a reference to it. I'd prefer a solution without VBA, so thanks a lot in advance.</p>
