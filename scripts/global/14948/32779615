<p>I am trying to find the first cell of a range containing a number lower or equal than the lookup value. The range is unsorted, and it must stay that way. </p>  <p><code>MATCH</code> function was my first choice, but it is not working on un-sorted data. For example, the below situation should return a result of 4 for the lookup value of 3 (since 2 is the first number equal or lower than 3, and it is the 4th number in the array). There is no exact match in this example, and <code>MATCH</code>with <code>match_type=-1</code>returns 3. I need to find a solution to return '4'.</p>  <pre><code>UNSORTED_MATCH of LOOKUP_Value=3 in array: 8 6 99 2 11 17 18 5 </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance for any idea.</p>
