<p>I have a column of 12 rows as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/p0OlK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/p0OlK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>For simplicity let's assume that the column is A and the values are in rows 1-12 (ignoring the first two rows).  </p>  <p>I need to calculate the CAG, for which the formula is:  </p>  <pre><code>(end value/beginning value)^1/(# of years) -1   </code></pre>  <p>Here it would be <code>(38026/2402)^(0.25)-1</code>. The small thing is that for every column I have, the first non zero value appears in a different row number. This both affects the years # in the formula, as well as the value in the beginning period.  </p>  <p>What formula would give me that?</p>
