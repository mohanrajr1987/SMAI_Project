<p>I am attempting to build an excel spreadsheet where there are tabs at the bottom of the excel sheet for each of the 12 months - within the 'month' sheets pulls data from another sheet. It should only pull the data though if the data is within the same month. </p>  <p>i.e.  "date received" in A column  "Fees" in B column </p>  <p>Should I be using a pivot table? Or can I write a formula instead?</p>  <p>I started writing one but I don't know if I am going along the right lines at all!</p>  <pre><code>=IF(ISERROR(INDEX($A$1:$B$5,SMALL(IF(AND($A$1:$A$5&gt;=$C$1,$A$1:$A$5&lt;=$D$1),ROW($A$1:$A$5)),ROW(1:1)),2)),"",INDEX($A$1:$B$5,SMALL(IF(AND($A$1:$A$5&gt;=$C$1,$A$1:$A$5&lt;=$D$1),ROW($A$1:$A$5)),ROW(1:1)),2)) </code></pre>  <p>Where A1:B5 is my table. (column A is the date and B are the fees). C1 and D1 is are the dates of the month (i.e. 1st October and 31st October).</p>  <p>What are peoples thoughts?</p>  <p>thank you</p>
