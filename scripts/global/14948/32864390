<p>I have a list of values which I have named "List1", and I want to sum all values in column B as follows:</p>  <p>The value in cell B5 is added if and only if the value in cell A5 belongs to List1.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>PS: I've tried using SUMIF, but I haven't managed to use the function match as a criterion there. Something like </p>  <blockquote>   <p>=SUMIF(B:B,A:A,MATCH(A:A,List1))</p> </blockquote>  <p>does not work.</p>
