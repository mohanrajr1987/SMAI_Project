<p>I have a working section of VBA code, which inserts an array formula into a specific cell. The formula is an INDEX MATCH function. </p>  <pre><code>For Each row In rng.Rows   For Each cell2 In row.Cells      cell2.FormulaArray = "=INDEX(Sheet2!C:C, MATCH(1,(Sheet2!A:A = A5)*(Sheet2!B:B=""Total""),0))"  Next cell2 Next row </code></pre>  <p>Every time I insert the formula into a cell, I want to increment the row number for A5, so next A6. The formula is being inserted in a For Each loop. In Excel this is represented as A$5.  </p>  <p>What's the VBA equivalent?</p>
