<p>Suppose I'm working in excel sheet "A" which has all the data. Sheet "B" accesses sheet "A" in a periodic manner, for example <code>cell A1 (in sheet "B") = "A!C1"</code> (in sheet "A") How can I increment the reference in sheet "B" by constant number of columns in sheet A (example 3 columns) so that I can get something like <code>cell A1 = "A!F1"</code>, <code>cell A2 = "A!I1"</code>, <code>cell A3 = "A!L1"</code> etc.</p>
