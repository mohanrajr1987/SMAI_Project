<p>Good day, I have finally decided to ask for help. I have 1 workbook, multiple worksheets. The formula gives me #Value! which I am understanding that it has a wrong datatype. I am simply wanting look at a range within 1 column of dates, then add a column of numbers in 2 separate columns and divide those 2 columns and multiply by 30. It amounts to this. SUM(D31/C31)*30. This small formula works great when just using the numbers. I am taking total hours divided by amount of production multiplied by 30 dollars per hour. Obviously I will do this for each month of the year.</p>  <p>The 2 sheets are labeled as follows. This formula below resides on sheet "Monthly". It is referencing sheet "Overall Cost". I am hoping I have given you enough information that perhaps you might have the time to assist me. Note: I have the range pretty long because this is supposed to work for the whole year so I made it 10,000 rows deep.</p>  <p>Formula:</p>  <pre><code>=SUMPRODUCT(('Overall Cost'!$B$3:$B$10000&lt;=DATE(2015,9,30))*('Overall Cost'!$B$3:$B$10000&gt;=DATE(2015,9,1)),SUM(('Overall Cost'!$D$3:$D$10000)/SUM('Overall Cost'!$C$3:$C$10000))*30) </code></pre>  <p>Sample data:</p>  <pre><code>               "B"      "C"    "D"                        SQ FT   Hours               Date       OH     OH Wednesday   8/10/15     3427    232 Thursday    8/11/15     5536    232 Friday      8/12/15     2364    232 Monday      8/1/15      6408    232 Tuesday      9/4/15     2499    232 Wednesday    9/5/15     870     232 </code></pre>
