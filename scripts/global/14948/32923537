<p>I have developed an Excel Spreadsheet that contains football (American term - soccer) positions, and I want to conditionally format the cells depending on their values. </p>  <p>This is the column that I have.  <BR>CB <BR>RW <BR>RB <BR>LB <BR>RB <BR>ST <BR>LW</p>  <p>and so on and so forth.  Now, CB, RB and LB are defensive positions, and I want to highlight them with a custom yellow fill. </p>  <p>I would have thought that the condition to be CB, RB, LB but it doesn't seem to work in the conditional formatting page. </p>  <p>How can I highlight them so they appear like this (bold being a yellow fill) but without the condition (text ends in B):<br> <BR><strong>CB</strong> <BR>RW <BR><strong>RB</strong> <BR><strong>LB</strong> <BR><strong>RB</strong> <BR>ST <BR>LW </p>
