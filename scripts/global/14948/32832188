<p>I have a main sheet with my data and 31 possible sheets with additional data used for input for various calculations. I want to use a VLOOKUP to grab the correct data, but Iml having a hard time with the additional sheet reference. I'm hoping to make this a dynamic formula based on the date in the third column on the main sheet.</p>  <p>This is what currently works:</p>  <pre><code>=VLOOKUP(A2,'1'!$A$1:$B$153, 2,TRUE ) </code></pre>  <p>I'm hoping to get something like the below to work:</p>  <pre><code>=VLOOKUP(A2,' "Day(C2)" '!$A$1:$B$153, 2,TRUE ) </code></pre>  <p>where C2 is my date, so then it would grab the day from that date and do the lookup against that sheet and range.</p>
