<p>I have formulas in Excel looking for matches by using:</p>  <pre><code> =IF(A2=B2,"Yes","No) </code></pre>  <p>I would like to count anything as a yes where the beginning of one matches the other (no matter how many characters).  Some examples of what I would like to return "Yes":</p>  <pre><code>  A2               B2 Justin Kelley     Justin K Just              Justin Justin K          Justin </code></pre>  <p>Some examples of what should return a "No":</p>  <pre><code>  A2               B2 Justin Kelley     Kelley Justin Justin K          Justun K Justin Kelley     Justin Ki </code></pre>  <p>I would normally use the LEFT(1) function here, but it will not capture if there are any differences after the first letter.</p>  <p>Just a little background - there are system errors cutting-off some of my data.  I only want to catch the human errors (the "No" returns).</p>
