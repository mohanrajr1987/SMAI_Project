<p>I have a table in Excel 2013 that has has thousands of records of food items (Beef-frozen, beef-chilled, beef-brisket, beef-ribs, chicken-fillet, chicken-whole, fish-skinned, fish-whole, yogurt, lettuce-imported, lettuce-frozen, tomato-fresh,tomato, water, milk,...etc) stored in column A. Notice the value may contain other content than the food item name.</p>  <p>I created column B next to column A. I want column B to hold the category of the food item in column A. For example, if A1 has in it "Beef" or "Chicken" or "Fish" then B1 should equal "Meat". If A1 has in it "Tomato" or "Lettuce" or "Onion" then B1 should equal "Vegetable".</p>  <p>What is the best way to achieve it?</p>
