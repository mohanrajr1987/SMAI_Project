<p>How can I compare two 5,000+ record columns and color format them?</p>  <p>Example, <code>If value in cell Ax = Bx then cell Cx color = green</code>.</p>  <p>I can do this for one row, but to manually do it for 5000+ records seem crazy, I KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER WAY, but I can't figure out how!  </p>  <p>If I use format painter, it copies the format of that cell, for example ($A1 = $B1), I need $A4599 = $B4599 and so forth.</p>
