<p>I have a table that's multiple thousand rows long, and I'd like to find duplicate rows. I've used countifs(), and it's functional, but it's also very resource-intensive, and I'd like to find a way to do this in a less expensive way.</p>  <p>An example of the data I'd like to check is as follows</p>  <pre><code>Date      Product Name     Quantity    Delivered to 10-1-15   Toilet Paper     1           Health Science 10-1-15   Paper Towel      1           Health Science 10-1-15   Can Liners       2           Health Science 10-2-15   Toilet Paper     2           Administration 10-2-15   Paper Towel      1           Health Science </code></pre>  <p>The formula I've used is</p>  <pre><code>=(countifs(A:A,A2,B:B,B2,C:C,C2,D:D,D2)) </code></pre>  <p>but this takes multiple minutes to evaluate with the amount of data I have. I'd like to set up a formula that only compares rows with the same date, so earlier rows don't have to recalculate, and later ones don't have to account for earlier additions.</p>  <p>The purpose behind this is to ensure that users of this sheet don't double-enter lines. I do a manual check for duplicates every week, as this is a tool for data mining our paper sign-out logs from a storage warehouse (we're aware it's an outdated system, but it's what we have to work with for now), but it'd make it easier to check my data if the sheet could alert me to possible duplications (especially without it taking 3 to 5 minutes to enter each line).</p>  <p>In addition, I'd prefer to use a formula, rather than VBA, as I have a hard enough time training people to use tools on a network drive without a scary warning about unsafe scripts.</p>
