<p>I have a use case where there's a cell for user input, and a bunch of other cells with formulas dependent on this cell. My intention is to sanitize the data before the formulas are calculated. These formulas can be quite expensive, so I'd like to prevent having them calculated on garbage data if possible. So I wanted to have some vba code check the input and clean it up before the formula calculation is fired. I set up a Worksheet_Change event to handle the user input, however, unfortunately, it would seem that dependent cells are calculated even before Worksheet_Change() is entered. Anyway I can achieve what I want?</p>
