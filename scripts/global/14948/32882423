<p>This question can be viewed as several small ones , but the main aim is one and only .</p>  <p><strong>TL;DR;</strong></p>  <p>I would like to apply an excel formula at sheet N , that will take into consideration all the corresponding columns, in full, in all the other sheets, while applying some conditions that are the same for all columns .</p>  <p><strong>Details :</strong></p>  <p>My spreadsheet is a very simple and basic expenses accounting , which has many sheets by years and dates named <code>2015.04</code>, <code>2015.05</code>, <code>2015.06</code> etc. First row is always title ( time, date, amount , project, category etc. ) and the columns are always corresponding ( for example in all sheets column <code>H</code> will be category and <code>D</code> will be amount )</p>  <p>The starting formula is :</p>  <pre><code>    =SUMIF('2015.07'.H2:H67;C20;'2015.07'.D2:D67) // C20 is only a search condition like "travel", or "F&amp;B" </code></pre>  <p>And it works at this simplified manual mode , but since we have computers, and I have a programmers M.O, I want to automate it a bit , and hence my problems :</p>  <p>1 - How to apply this formula to all sheets , even if some are later added / deleted , e.g. the equivalent of "sheet wildcard " </p>  <pre><code> =SUMIF('*'.H2:H67;C20;'*'.D2:D67) // all sheets </code></pre>  <p>or </p>  <pre><code>=SUMIF('2015*'.H2:H67;C20;'2015*'.D2:D67) // all year </code></pre>  <p>2 - Since the columns are not the same length , it is seems stupid to apply manual range , so I tried </p>  <pre><code>  =SUMIF('2015.07'.H:H;C20;'2015.07'.D:D)  </code></pre>  <p>But it gives me several different errors .</p>  <p>3 - ONE of the errors I can understand, and that is that the first row TITLE is not a number , so I tried </p>  <pre><code>=SUMIF('2015.07'.H1:H67;C20;ISNUMBER('2015.07'.D1:D99) )// err 504 </code></pre>  <p>and also tried </p>  <pre><code>=SUMIF('2015.07'.H1:H67;C20;IF(ISNUMBER('2015.07'.D1:D99) ))// err 509 </code></pre>  <p>and </p>  <pre><code>=SUMIF('2015.07'.H1:H67;C20;sum(IF(ISNUMBER('2015.07'.D1:D99)) ))// err 508 </code></pre>  <p>Now, I know I can take the simple working starting formula , put it in every single page, select the exact range without title, and then at the last summery page reference all the others - but seriously, I could also use an <code>ABACUS</code> , this is not why tools like excel were invented . or am I presuming too much of this tool ? is it that primitive ? I somehow refuse to believe it and just blame myself for not knowing it as well as I should .</p>  <p>I also know I can write a <code>VBA</code> macro, but at this point, it would take me much less effort and time to take <a href="https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel" rel="nofollow">some PHP excel</a> library write some  PHP lines , dump all in SQL and do it right . But again - is it my fault ( probably ) or excel's ??</p>  <p>P.S>. Using OpenOffice Calc if that matters , but tried all also in excel with change of syntax and different error codes .</p>
