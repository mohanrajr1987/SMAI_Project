<p>I have a list of values in column A, and another list of values in column B.</p>  <p>I am trying to have a single cell in column C indicate TRUE if any value in column A is in Column B, or FALSE is no value in column A is in Column B.</p>  <p>I tried MATCH(lookup value, in range), but that only looks at one value in A. </p>  <p>Is it possible to do this without VBA? Open to VBA solutions also. Thanks</p>
