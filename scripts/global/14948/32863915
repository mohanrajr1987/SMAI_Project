<p>I have a workbook Called Price list, it contain several worksheets each worksheet is in the same format but contain different classifications of products. The format of a work sheet is as folows:</p>  <blockquote> <pre><code> A          B          C      D </code></pre>      <p>1    PRC      DESCRIPTION  UNIT  PRICE</p>      <p>2   A001      Product1     Each    20.00</p>      <p>3   D001      Product2      L       5.00</p>      <p>4   H001      Product3      Rol     4.00  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Every month We get an Updated Price List as an Exel workbook.</p>  <p>In the past we got all the information as above but something changed at the Supplier and we only receive the "Product code" "Bar-code" and "Price"</p>  <p>I need to update my <strong>"Price-list"</strong> by matching the Product Code in the <strong>"Update"</strong> with the one in my Price list. Then compare price, if the price differs it should change the price in the <strong>"Price-list"</strong> to that of the <strong>"Update"</strong> </p>  <p>If posible it should delete the line in the <strong>"Update"</strong> for us to know if there are new Products and delete the Line in the <strong>"Price-List"</strong> if the product code is not found in the "Update", For discontinued Products. </p>  <p>The "Update" Contains about 12000 lines</p>  <p><strong>Is there an easy way in doing it?</strong></p>
