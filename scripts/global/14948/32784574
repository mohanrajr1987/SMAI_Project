<p>Updated Question:</p>  <p>Someone left an answer with a CountIF (I think the comment was removed) the count if works; thank you! :)  ....When I copy this formula to the next column it doesn't seem to work,  the line below is the count if formula<br>                                                                                                                                                                   <code>=IF(COUNTIF(Sheet2!$A$1:$A$4,"*"&amp;J2&amp;"*")&gt;0,"found","none")</code></p>  <p>I want the If to select text values in sheet 2 column A1:A4 </p>  <hr>  <p>Original Question:</p>  <p>I want to create an IF statement which finds more than one value I have tried adding another IF but this doesn't seem to work and i am not sure why. </p>  <p>Below is the formula i have so far.</p>  <pre><code>   =IF(IFERROR(SEARCH(Sheet2!$A$1, I2), 0), "found", "none") </code></pre>  <p>This searches in Sheet 2 what is in Column A row 1 if this is found in Column I2 of the Sheet 1. </p>  <p>I want the IF statement to also find what is in Sheet2!$A$2, Sheet2!$A$3 and Sheet2!$A$4 </p>
