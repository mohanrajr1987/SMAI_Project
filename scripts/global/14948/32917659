<p>So say I have a sheet like the following:</p>  <pre><code>Row    1    2    3    4    5    6 1      x                   2           x              3      x         x        4                     x 5           x              x 6                               x </code></pre>  <p>And I have another sheet which I want to encapsulate the data with:</p>  <pre><code>1st appeared 1 2 1 4 2 6 </code></pre>  <p>I'm basically trying to construct the second sheet. Is there a way for each row to start at column two and go up to the ith column and display where the first 'x' appears. (Note that we can assume that every row will have at least 1 'x' when the row and column meet forming a diagonal down the entire first sheet) [Note that my first spreadsheet is roughly 5,000 x 5,000 hence why I'd like a nice formula for this instead of doing things by hand =)]</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
