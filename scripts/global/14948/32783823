<p>I want a function that checks what is in the 'deck choice' column (F). And then store the wins, loses and draws of that 'deck'. So for example:</p>  <p>The 'TES' deck would have <code>10</code> wins, <code>6</code> loses and <code>1</code> draw. I want the three pieces of information to be displayed like the total values to the right of the table.</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10KIo6lBSR3hCEl0mPQzNKyG0JTmIR9MamkISrphsiLk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">The spreadsheet in question.</a></p>
