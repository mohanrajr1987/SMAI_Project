<p>I would like to have a button on this excel sheet whose name should be “Save as PDF”.</p>  <p>When I press this button it should save the excel sheet’s all data into PDF at the path- M:\formats\ ‘File Name’</p>  <p>‘File Name’ should be the value of cell No H8.</p>  <p>In another words when I click “Save as PDF” button it should save the excel file in pdf form, into the above mentioned path and also with the name whichever is written in cell no H8.</p>  <p>For example, if the name ANDREW PITTERSON is written in H8 cell then it should save with the same name I.e. ANDREW PITTERSON.</p>  <p>Kindly look at this snapshot.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/JJdlFSi.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/JJdlFSi.jpg</a> THANKS</p>
