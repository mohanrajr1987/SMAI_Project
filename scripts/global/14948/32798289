<p>In my spreadsheet I have certain formulas that give as output <em>texts</em> of the form: <code>A1+B3+D9</code>.</p>  <p>These are cell references, the cell rows and columns are calculated automatically within the original formula.</p>  <p>I would like this to be a formula that then gets evaluated. At present I simply copy-special paste as <em>value</em> and then by hand put an <code>=</code> at the front.</p>  <p>Is there an excel command that does this automatically? i.e. takes a text input, interprets the input as an excel formula and hence evaluates it accordingly.</p>
