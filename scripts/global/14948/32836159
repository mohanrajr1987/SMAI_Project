<p>In the image you can see the detail of project value, time frame, opportunity and comments are in so many cells:  </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R9jni.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R9jni.jpg" alt="SO32836159 question example"></a>  </p>  <p>What I want is if heading is project value then data should be in one cell, same as the time frame. For example, for Timeframe: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>-- Evaluation: Immediate / Appointment likely by December 2015<br>              -- IT upgradation: Starting January 2016 / Completion by March 2016  </p> </blockquote>  <p>these two lines should be in same cell.  </p>  <p>I have lots of data in same format and need VBA help for this.</p>
