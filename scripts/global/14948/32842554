<p>I have a sheet named <code>Skruvdragare</code> where cells B1-B500 contain serial numbers like: <code>123456789</code>, <code>987654321</code> etc and a second sheet <code>Låda 1</code> in which I will also put in some serial numbers (not necessarily the same numbers as in the <code>Skruvdragare</code> sheet).  </p>  <p>If I put in a serial number, anywhere in <code>Låda 1</code>, which exists in <code>Skruvdragare</code> I want the row for this serial number to turn to red background and white text in the <code>Skruvdragare</code> sheet.</p>
