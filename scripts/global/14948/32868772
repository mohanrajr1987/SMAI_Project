<p>I have a table of data, a selection of which look like: </p>  <pre><code>BARC    0.0001  0.0003  0.0006  0.0012  0.0009  0.0010  0.0008  0.0024 BNP     0.1915  4.1915  0.2314  0.3147  0.3168  0.3300  0.3060  0.4277 CSGN    0.1915  0.0003  0.2221  0.0104  0.0109  0.0124  0.0097  0.0152 </code></pre>  <p>The data in each cell are linked to a separate worksheet which share a name with the names in the first column. Each entry in the table for each column references the same cell but in a different worksheet. So B1 is BARC!G850, B2 is BNP!G850, and B3 IS CSGN!G850. The references are the same for each cell besides the worksheet name, but they don't increase incrementally across the rows; C1 IS BARC!G858 and D1 is BARC!G863, for example. </p>  <p>I want to use a formula to automatically populate the table instead of typing out the worksheet name references by hand. How can I do this?</p>
