<p>I have a very confusing data to handle and seem to see no solution to this problem.</p>  <p>In sheet1, i have a list of Names and Dates-Time which i need to look-up in sheet2 with conditions. Example, if the name in Sheet1 matches the name in Sheet2, check for the next pass closest date (dates are not in ascending order) in Sheet 2. If both condition mentioned is met, copy the value (example: apple,orange,mango) to the matching row (matching name) in Sheet1. (do not replace the data but copy to the adjacent cell within same row). </p>  <p>I have tried everything like look-up, nested If, MAX/MIN for days but nothing worked the way i wanted it to be. I know that someone in this forum will be able to sort it out. Please help me out. Appreciate.</p>
