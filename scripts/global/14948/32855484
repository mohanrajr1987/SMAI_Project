<p>I have a 14 column range of survey data presented in 1's, 0's and "null". In another column, I have company names for which the survey was submitted. I want to count the number of 1's (satisfied), 0's (unsatisfied) and nulls (no answer), and then average the satisfaction rate, for each company name. </p>  <p>For example, on the Grand Total row of my pivot table, I am counting all satisfactory marks with =COUNTIF(Table1[[Q1]:[Q14]],1) but I can't figure out how to limit the count to rows with a specific company name. </p>  <p><em>edit</em></p>  <p>Here is a screenshot of the sheet I am trying to describe. <a href="http://imgur.com/tWwRvov" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/tWwRvov</a></p>  <p>With Linga’s COUNTIFS suggestion, I wrote it as  <code>=COUNTIFS(Table1[[Q1]:[Q14]],1,Table1[Company Name],”Company1”)</code> and get a #VALUE error.</p>  <p>I believe the error is because the number of cells in the 2 ranges don’t align, so I also tried including each Q column as a separate criteria range like: </p>  <p>=COUNTIFS(Table1[Q1],1,Table1[Q2],1,…Table1[Company Name],”Company1”). </p>  <p>The formula validated but the count is not correct.</p>
