<p>I hardly use Excel so not at all familiar with Excel functions.<br> I want to check whether a specific value is there or not then will do some operation for example, below columns in Excel (total number of rows will be around 1000).</p>  <p><strong>Sheet1</strong></p>  <pre><code>A   B    C   D    E -------------------- 1   Jan  4   2    0 2   Mar  8   2    0 3   Apr  1   0    8 4   Apr  5   3    8 </code></pre>  <p>Now on sheet2 I want to show the sum for each month for C, D, E whenever a new row will be added to sheet1 it will automatically update the value for the corresponding month in sheet2 </p>  <p><strong>Sheet2</strong></p>  <pre><code>Month    C   D    E -------------------- Jan      4   2    0     Mar      8   2    0     Apr      6   3    16  </code></pre>  <p>Can you please let me know how I can achieve this? Which formula I have to use  and how (example) ?</p>
