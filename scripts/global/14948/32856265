<p>I'm using Google Sheets and am trying to get this formula to work to give the me the following count:</p>  <p>Count when Column T = <code>Kenneth</code> AND Column U = (<code>Pending</code> OR <code>Contacted</code>) AND Column W has a date that falls between the dates shown in B14 and B15.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>=sum(countifs(Users!$T:$T,"Kenneth",Users!$U:$U,{"Pending","Contacted"},Users!$W:$W,"&gt;"&amp;$B14,Users!$W:$W,"&lt;="&amp;$B15)) </code></pre>  <p>This is giving me the correct count for <code>Pending</code> alone but it is ignoring all the <code>Contacted</code> rows so somehow it is not recognizing that OR operator.</p>
