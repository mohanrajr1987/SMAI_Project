<p>I have a list with hidden rows and want to make a dropdown menu without the hidden ones. How can i do this so that the dropdown only uses the not hidden rows/cells?</p>  <p>If i filter the rows to my criterias and i want to make a dropdown menu with the rest of the cells from the not hidden rows. it also uses the hidden rows. what i don't want. I can't delete the hidden rows. and only copying the hole stuff without the hidden ones is not the best idea.</p>  <p>so does anyone has an idea how my dropdown menu can ignore hidden rows/ cells?</p>  <p>please help me :) thanks</p>
