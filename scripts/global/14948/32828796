<p>I have a sheet with about a million rows. Within one particular column, I have numbers ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>50,000</code>.</p>  <p><strong>I am trying to determine, within a filtered range, how many cells in the filtered range fall within a certain value.</strong></p>  <p>I can easily do a <code>=COUNTIF(L:L, "&lt;5000")</code> to see how many rows are less than 5,000, or <code>=COUNTIFS(L:L,"&gt;500",L:L,"&lt;5000")</code> to see numbers in the TOTAL range that fall between two numbers, but I cannot figure out how to do either of these <em>in a filtered range</em>.</p>  <p>Normally with filtered data I use the <code>=SUBTOTAL</code> function, but I cannot see how any of the established <code>=SUBTOTAL</code> functions would work in this example.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
