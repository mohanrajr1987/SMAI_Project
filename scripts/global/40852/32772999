<p>I am trying to use new TPL .net library instead of threads. We have a specific case where before starting new Task we want to identify if there are already max number of tasks (lets say 10) running with our custom name/id. </p>  <p>Is that possible or do I need to maintain this in Tasks[] ?</p>  <p>Here is theoretical flow, we have 3 different kind of priority jobs. P1 being highest priority and p3 being lowest priority. Below table shows the flow of what will happen in the system.</p>  <p>Hope this make sense. </p>  <pre><code>Running Threads P1 Jobs Pending P2 Jobs Pending P3 Jobs Pending Result 0               5               1               1               Start 7 tasks 7               0               1               2               Start 3 additional tasks 10              0               0               1               Wait for thread to free up </code></pre>
