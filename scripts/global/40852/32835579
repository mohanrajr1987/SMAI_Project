<p>I'm implementing a variant of random walk algorithm . at each step it will build a graph. which is memory intensive typically in GBs. I can't store it in main memory of single machine. I tried hadoop but came to know hadoop is inefficient for multiple writes and where network communications are high.</p>  <p>Is there any distributed computing framework applicable for this scenario?</p>
