<p>I am using <code>WindowsIdentity.Impersonate</code> in order to read from remote registry. However, the actual code that is reading registry located in <code>Task</code> delegates, so it may run on different threads. My question is whether it is legit to impersonate in UI thread and do the elevated job in Thread Pool?</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <pre><code>// get userHandle from LogonUser(...)     Task task = Task.Run(() =&gt;  {     using (impersonationContext = WindowsIdentity.Impersonate(userHandle))     {         // Do stuff here         if (impersonationContext != null)         {             impersonationContext.Undo();         }     } } </code></pre>
