<p>I am getting this error only for the first time I start my app, every second time I do perform same operation (without closing the app) this error is not preventing app to work as it should.</p>  <p>Now here is the code that is done and what is actually happening so everybody can have a clear picture:</p>  <pre><code>                   Task&lt;int&gt; t = new Task&lt;int&gt;(                     (temp) =&gt;                     {                         //somework                         SomeWorkMethod();                          return somenumber;                     },                     somenumber, ct);                  t.ContinueWith(                     a =&gt;                     {                         switch(a.Status)                         {                             case TaskStatus.RanToCompletion:                                 // do something                                 break;                             case TaskStatus.Canceled:                             case TaskStatus.Faulted:                                 // do something                                 break;                         }                                             },                     CancellationToken.None);                  t.Start(); </code></pre>  <p>Now here what going on in SomeWorkMethod:</p>  <p>At some point I am raising an exception in order to call form that will enable user to enter credentials for login:</p>  <pre><code>            using(SomeForm frm = new SomeForm(username))             {                 DialogResult dr = frm.ShowDialog(this);                 if(dr == DialogResult.OK)                 {                     username = frm.Username;                     password = frm.Password;                                         }                 else if(dr == DialogResult.Cancel)                 {                     return true;                 }             } </code></pre>  <p>Form is being shown without problems, I enter credentials and flow inside task continues but when it comes to the point <code>t.ContinueWith</code> it just never enters inside, I mean this task is never started or created. That's when the error is shown "The Undo operation encountered a context that is different from what was applied in the corresponding Set operation. The possible cause is that a context was Set on the thread and not reverted(undone)";</p>  <p>I've research a lot online, and my app is <strong>.NET 3.5</strong>. I am not using anywhere <code>Application.DoEvents</code> as some searches pointed out.</p>  <p>If I again start this method every other time it just runs till the end with success. I cannot understand why it doesn't work only for the first time when my app is started.</p>  <p>Another important info, after user enter credentials in that form, form is not being shown any more. Maybe that is the reason why am I getting that error only for the first time.</p>  <p>Thanks for helping me with this one.</p>
