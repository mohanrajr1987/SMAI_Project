<p>In my application, I have a utility class which is supposed to execute a series of tasks in parallel, and provide reporting on the success and timing of the various tasks.</p>  <p>Every time I run it, I get an EntryPointNotFoundException.</p>  <p>The simplest test case I could come up with which creates the behavior is beyond trivial.  Just</p>  <pre><code> Task.Run(() =&gt; { Console.WriteLine("This is sanity test"); }); </code></pre>  <p>using no return value, and no custom classes anywhere throws an EntryPointNotFoundException.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hm6ib.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hm6ib.png" alt="VS2015 image showing code and exception"></a></p>  <p>This is with Visual Studio 2015, the process is 64 bit (which for the overall application it MUST be, running on Windows 7 64-bit).  It is a .NET 4.5 console application.</p>  <p>What causes this and how can it be fixed?</p>
