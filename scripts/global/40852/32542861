<p>I've read the advice many times from people smarter than me, and it has few caveats: <strong>Always use <code>ConfigureAwait(false)</code> inside library code</strong>. So I'm fairly certain I know the the answer, but I want to be 100%. The scenario is I have a library that thinly wraps some other asynchronous library.</p>  <p>Library code:</p>  <pre><code>public async Task DoThingAsyc() {     // do some setup     return await otherLib.DoThingAsync().ConfigureAwait(false); } </code></pre>  <p>Application code:</p>  <pre><code>// need to preserve my synchronization context await myLib.DoThingAync(); // do I have my context here or did my lib lose it? </code></pre>
