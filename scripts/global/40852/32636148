<p>I have a C# .NET 4.5 application heavily using the Task Parallel Library that eventually ends up starved for threads after days of operation.</p>  <p>When I grab a HANG dump from AdPlus and look at the threads via Visual Studio, I see 43 threads with no apparent origin in my code:</p>  <pre><code>ntdll.dll!_NtWaitForSingleObject@12()  + 0x15 bytes  ntdll.dll!_NtWaitForSingleObject@12()  + 0x15 bytes  kernel32.dll!@BaseThreadInitThunk@12()  + 0x12 bytes     ntdll.dll!___RtlUserThreadStart@8()  + 0x27 bytes    ntdll.dll!__RtlUserThreadStart@8()  + 0x1b bytes     </code></pre>  <p>Why do these threads show no managed origin in their stack trace?</p>
