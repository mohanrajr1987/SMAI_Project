<p>My DataFlow pipeline starts with a <code>BatchBlock</code>. I would like to trigger the <code>BatchBlock</code> with the help of the <code>TriggerBatch()</code> method. My batch sizes can be variable, so when creating the <code>Batchblock</code> I have placed a rather high <code>BatchSize</code> which I don't really expect to be reached.</p>  <p>Now I would like to call the <code>TriggerBatch()</code> method depending on the fact that whether the <code>BatchBlock</code> indeed has some elements in it which could infact be triggered into a batch. Is there a way to check whether the internal buffer of the <code>Batchblock</code> is non-empty? If not, could someone please suggest a solution for the same to me. The <code>BatchBlock</code> is being fed from multiple threads which <code>Post()</code> data into the <code>Batchblock</code>. However I would like a mechanism which could wait until there are elements present in the <code>Batchblock</code> before triggering it. Basically I would not want my <code>TriggerBatch()</code> to be fruitless. Unfortunately, using a timer is not an option for me.</p>  <p>At this point I do need a third persons opinion as I have been stuck on this for quite a while now.</p>
