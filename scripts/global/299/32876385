<h2>Tracking state of Chrome's Click-to-play feature</h2>  <p>How do you detect that a Flash plugin has been temporarily disabled, or, conversely, detect that it has been enabled due to Chrome's "click-to-play" feature?</p>  <h3>Background</h3>  <p>Chrome's new "click-to-play" feature detects plugins that are not visibly significant and pauses them. Chrome displays a "play" button over the plugin, a user may click the "play" button to activate the plugin. (reference: <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/xPcpRBzyPcc" rel="nofollow">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/xPcpRBzyPcc</a>) </p>  <p>Here's a screenshot of it in action (notice white play buttons): <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lj3DD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lj3DD.png" alt="NFL.com Flash plugin disabled by default"></a></p>  <p>You can see in this screen shot that it has paused a video-player (right column). That video player has HTML5-based controls overlaying a Flash-based video player. So, there's no way for a user to click the play-button as the entire SWF is purposefully covered by HTML5-based play/pause controls.</p>  <p>What I need is to detect when the SWF has been paused by the "click-to-play" feature so I can disable the controls and make the SWF interactive. </p>  <h3>What I've tried</h3>  <ol> <li>In JavaScript - All methods exposed via <code>ExternalInterface</code> are still available though the SWF is paused. It actually responds like it's playing and does not return an error. </li> <li>In JavaScript - Update the size of the embedded <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> to > 700x400px. "Click-to-play" does not pause a SWF of this size. So, I tried using <code>-webkit-transfor: scale(0.5)</code> to use CSS to scale it back to desired size. Chrome calculates the final rendered size and pauses the SWF regardless.</li> <li>In Flash - <code>stage.frameRate</code> returns correct value (it's not set to 0 to pause the SWF for instance)</li> </ol>  <hr>  <p>In writing up this question I found an answer, decided to post here anyways in case others need help with this issue. </p>
