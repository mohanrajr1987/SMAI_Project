<p>I am currently working on a flash website where I have to use sikuli to automate the testNG testcase. I am working in some other tabs also simultaneously while executing  the test case,because of which I am  finding an issue, since sikuli needs mouse cursor interaction for clicking on the image it does not click on the image whereas it remains on the same page. Can anyone suggest me if there is a way through which images can be clicked without mouse interaction, so that test case does not fail?</p>
