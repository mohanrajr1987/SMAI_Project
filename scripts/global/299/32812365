<p>I am not really what I consider programmer. I know basic html - css and a touch of php just enough to know whats going on under the hood But, my knowledge of flash is very limmeted.</p>  <p>My probelm is that I purchased a live cam streaming website without first really thinking about it lol. The broadcaster and chat are flash so not everyone can stream thier cam, veiw streams or participate in chat.</p>  <p>What are my options? </p>
