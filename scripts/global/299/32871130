<p>Forgive me if this is a stupid question - I'm pretty new to coding. How can I add a Clicktag to a Dreamweaver HTML document? I have some Flash ads built out with lots of clicktags (for AOL, Google, etc.), but I need to add these clicktags to a Dreamweaver document. Apparently I can't just copy and paste because the clicktags in Flash are written in ActionScript. Any ideas? Thanks!</p>
