<p>I want to add game like effects to a web app to make it more interactive and fun for the user. Specifically, when someone fills out an answer, I want to have a little character that does a dance, or gold coins pop out - something similar to what you would see in a game. </p>  <p>What is the best way to do this? I'm a little confused on if this is possible through HTML5, or if I still need to work with Flash, or what. I'm not sure of the terminology to use to search for the answer, and so far I've found CSS3 animations and HTML5 vector animations but these aren't exactly what I'm looking for. </p>  <p>I would appreciate any insight, even on just what terms to search for!</p>  <p>Thanks, Heather</p>
