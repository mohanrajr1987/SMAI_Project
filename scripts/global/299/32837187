<p>My E-learning course is not playing flash files from IE9 onwards. It is an old course that we have to make it compatible with IE9 onwards compatible. I made some R&amp;D and found that fscommand is not working with IE9 and others and so flash is not loading. Can you please give me a solution or alternative to make it working on IE9 and newer. We need to deliver this course as soon as possible pls help.</p>
