<p>So I have a very simple webpage, m0rgan.net, and I want to improve the buttons by using flash but I don't know how and all tutorial's I have been shown seem to require a third party program such as Dreamweaver and such. What I'm trying to do is make it so that on the event that a users mouse hovers over the button it will change image1.jpg to image2.jpg, image2 being a slight difference such as increased size or outer glow.</p>  <p>How can I do this? (Note: I don't have any experience with flash currently, only HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS.)</p>
