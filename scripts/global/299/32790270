<p>I'm attempting a to make a Fighting game with multiple platforms. I've currently successfully made the controls, movement, (double)jumping, and gravity parts of the game.</p>  <p>My problem is, when a player jumps (more visible when the player Double jumps), when they reach the ground, they seem to go a bit deeper than they should on the platform (they should land and stay on the surface of the platform).</p>  <p>I know why this happens; <strong><em>it's because sometimes <code>hitTestObject</code> takes a while to react when objects come in too quickly.</em></strong></p>  <p>So, the first thing I thought up is to make the player's foot's <code>y axis</code> equal to the <code>y axis</code> of the top of the platform he lands on.</p>  <p><strong>The problem is; that solution resulted in a rather jerky landing.</strong></p>  <p><strong>So, my question is; Is there a way to make the player to land smoothly on the top surface of the platform?</strong></p>  <p>Some things I've tried:</p>  <p>-Raising FPS, it just made the same effect happen, but more quickly.</p>  <p>-Decreasing the speed at which the player falls, <em>but that makes the game less fun, so I'm crossing it out.</em></p>  <p>And here's my Code:</p>  <p><strong>Gravity and Jumping:</strong></p>  <pre><code>stage.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, loop); var jumpConstant:Number = 30; var gravityConstant:Number = 1.8; function loop(e:Event):void //happens  {     if(player.leg1.foreleg1.foot1.hitTestObject(platforms.ground)||player.leg2.foreleg2.foot2.hitTestObject(platforms.ground)) //if either of the player's legs are colliding with the platform [ps: nested movieclips]     {         player.ySpeed = 0; //the player stops going downwards         player.y = platforms.y; //the player's y becomes the platform's y. don't worry, it puts the player in the right place, just not smoothly.         if (player.b_up) //if Up control button (W or Up Arrow) is being pressed         {             player.ySpeed = -player.jumpConstant; //make the player jump          }     else //if the player isn't colliding with the platform     {         player.ySpeed += player.gravityConstant; //the player is affected by gravity and is pulled downwards     } </code></pre>  <p>It has more code than that, but that's all that's relevant.</p>  <p><strong>Link to the game if you wanna try it out to see the jerky effect:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.fastswf.com/-64Ux3I" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastswf.com/-64Ux3I</a></p>  <p>Thank you in advance :)</p>
