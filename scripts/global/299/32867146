<p>What are the best practices to convert large/rich flash application to html5? My App contains a lot of complex AS3, what tool can convert multiple AS3 classes on fly?</p>  <p>I am not looking for a tool like SWIFFY to convert a little banner or game ( the good small tools are already listed at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18139937/flash-to-html5-converter">Flash to html5 converter</a> )</p>  <p>Is the Flash Pro CC a good coice to complete the conversion work semi-manually?</p>  <p>I have also tried Sothink SWF compiler html5 export, but it did not seem to convert AS well.</p>
