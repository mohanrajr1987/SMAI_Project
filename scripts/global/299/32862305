<p>I need to record a dynamic SWF to FLV. Don't want to watch the whole animation. Just to get the FLV flie at the end.<br/>  If I could do it for a bunch of URLs it would be great!</p>  <p>I understand there is a way to do this with JSFL but my knowledge on the whole command line is very poor... :(</p>  <p>The SWF gets an ID and upload a picture according to the ID. Also I have different SWF (like 5 of them) according to a parameter from the URL. </p>  <p>Could somebody help me with this?<br/> Does somebody know how to do this?</p>  <p>Thank you :]</p>
