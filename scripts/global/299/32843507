<p>I have a video tag and a movie cutted in parts of 10 seconds each, with name: 1.webm, 2.webm ....... 1535.webm. I tried to make a js code which find when the video is ended and play the next one, but I have a problem: the screen flashes and the movie is not playing continously. I need to play it exactly as a movie, with continous video.</p>  <p><em>Is there any options to do this? Any type of help is really appreciated. It doesn't matter if it is not in javascript or if it is a combination of many scripts and codes.</em></p>  <pre><code>&lt;video id="my_video" width="640" height="480" autoplay&gt;     &lt;source src="files/1.webm" type="video/webm"&gt; &lt;/video&gt;  &lt;script&gt; var src = 0; var video = document.getElementById("my_video");  document.querySelector("#my_video").addEventListener("ended", nextVideo, false);  function nextVideo() {     src = src + 1;     video.src = "files/" + src + ".webm";     video.play(); } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thank you so much all!!!!!</p>
