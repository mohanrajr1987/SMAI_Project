<p>I converted a flash to html5 using google-swiffy, but some of the images are not rendering properly, it is somehow cut forming a triangle. I only experience this using the android stock browser but not using chrome in the same device. I did not experience it in ipad or in ie 11. Any explanation why this happens.</p>  <p>Thanks. Naide</p>
