<p>I am creating a website form the scratch using php HTML5 CSS and javascript. I am getting data from a mysql database. What i want is to create a tag cloud system to present the most popular categories that have been accessed recently. I would like to have a good presentation also. Should i use flash for that? Thanks in advance.</p>
