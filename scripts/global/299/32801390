<p>I'm using dropbox to distribute large swf files with corresponding html files that load the swfs. All the large swf files access a small "Key" swf in the same folder as the html file. That all works fine. But when the large swf files also try to access a remote text file on my server I get a security sandbox violation. After reading about this, I see that this is by design for security reasons. </p>  <p>But there has to be a way around this without having the user authorize the domain containing the txt file. The reason I say this is because the swf files are running right from the browser on the persons computer. I then thought about a cross domain policy. Not sure what it would look like since it's a local computer that's asking. I hope this makes sense. I was hoping I could put the cross domain policy (or some other file) on the users computer right along with the other files, but I don't think that's what they're for.</p>  <p>This is an update to the question above as my problems relate to crossdomain policy's.  I'm showing a small snippet of code that is causing this error shown in Debug mode in the Flash IDE. The code eventually gets the txt file loaded, but is delayed due to the warning I believe and I'm wondering if this can be fixed? The delay is causing an issue.</p>  <p>Attempting to launch and connect to Player using URL C:\Users\Jeffrey\Dropbox\Photos\ABC\bopAnimationSales\testingGettingVariablesFromExternalSWF_simplestForm3.swf [SWF] C:\Users\Jeffrey\Dropbox\Photos\ABC\bopAnimationSales\testingGettingVariablesFromExternalSWF_simplestForm3.swf - 21834 bytes after decompression Warning: Domain www.postureviewer.com does not specify a meta-policy.
