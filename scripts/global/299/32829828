<p>Built a Flash canvas project using createJS and have some movieclip objects created dynamically. While I am able to reference each one of them just fine by name from external JS (and even read other properties), it appears that calling any of the play methods for the timeline of any one of those objects is ignored. I've tried MC2Play.play() as well as MC2Play.gotoAndPlay(1), etc... </p>  <p>I've tried adding a method within the Flash timeline (both at the root and at the root of the movieclip object of interest) to request the play() method - but the result is the same.</p>  <p>I'm sure it's a reference issue, but I'm not sure how to fix it.</p>  <p>I've tried creating a function at the root level of the Flash timeline to step through each of the objects and assign a reference object = this.object, but that doesn't seem to help either.</p>  <p>Ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
