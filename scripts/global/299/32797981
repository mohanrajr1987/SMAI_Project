<p>I want to clone a TextureMaterial, modify it and keep the original and the clone for later use.</p>  <p>What I did so far is following:</p>  <pre><code>var BT:BitmapTexture = defaultMaterial.texture as BitmapTexture; var BD:BitmapData = BT.bitmapData; var clone:BitmapData = BD.clone(); var newBT:BitmapTexture = new BitmapTexture(clone); transparentMaterial = new TextureMaterial(newBT, false, true); transparentMaterial.lightPicker = defaultMaterial.lightPicker;  </code></pre>  <p>But the cloned TextureMaterial does not look like the original (see attachment). Can anyone help me with that problem please? I think i am missing some important information from the texture? uv-coordinates maybe or something like that.</p>  <p>I also posted my problem here with an additional image as attachment: <a href="http://away3d.com/forum/viewthread/5956/" rel="nofollow">http://away3d.com/forum/viewthread/5956/</a></p>
