<p>I'm trying to make a PHP script that updates photos. I receive the raw image data from the source, and I want to compare it to the existing file I have to see if I should download it. I'll post the idea of what I'm looking to do.</p>  <pre><code>$contents = file_get_contents($directory); $new_photo = Photo["Data"]; echo strcmp($liph_id_contents,$photo['Data']==0); </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't work, but I hope you get the idea. The images I am trying to compare are .jpg</p>  <p>Photo["Data"] is raw image data</p>  <p>$directory is the location of a stored image file</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I'm able to convert the two images in to PHP image resources. A comparison between image resources would also suffice.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I found a class to use to compare two image resources in PHP. Take a look at <a href="http://compareimages.nikhazy-dizajn.hu/" rel="nofollow">http://compareimages.nikhazy-dizajn.hu/</a> I made a slight change to the compare function in the class to let it take PHP image resources instead.</p>
