<p>For first, I'm really sorry for my English.</p>  <p>My question: Let's say you code a few HTML pages with one CSS file. Now, not every HTML page uses everything out of the CSS file. How can I see what a specified page is using out of the CSS in the easiest way?</p>  <p>The purpose: I have a CSS file with more than 4500 lines. Instead to search the whole HTML for the CSS classes etc. and remove them, I'd like to see everything that this page is using - So, everything in CSS, what is not needed, to delete.</p>
