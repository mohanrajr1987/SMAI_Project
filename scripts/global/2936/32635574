<p>I have two CSV files who are expected to have the same content. However, the second CSV file has the same data but the columns are rearranged in it. I am more concerned about comparing the data though. Is there any way I can compare the two CSV files on the basis of columns? I mean, comparing column 1 from firstCSV with column 2 of secondCSV. Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
