<p>I've been looking around on the internet, don't know if it is my way googling works but i've been trying to find a way to update a specific value from two very different text files with quite different strings with batch.</p>  <p>So here's the old text file with old values</p>  <pre><code>m_dwEntityList=0x07A45A14 m_dwLocalPlayer=0x00B937CC m_dwClientState=0x004D1624 </code></pre>  <p>and here's the new with updated values: </p>  <pre><code>EntityList -&gt; m_dwEntityList: _________________ 0x04A35A14 LocalPlayer -&gt; m_dwLocalPlayer: _______________ 0x00A932CC ClientState -&gt; m_dwClientState: _______________ 0x005D1224 </code></pre>  <p>Is there a script to update the old text file values from the new text file?</p>
