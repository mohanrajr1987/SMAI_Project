<p>What I am trying to do, is compare a test data set, built into a dictionary, to the learning data set, which is also built into a dictionary.  I have tried a number of ways, and I either get 0's back on all the checks, or I get answers that are impossible (I think that it's counting for all  int the testing set) rather than what it looks like it should be doing, which (SO I keep thinking) resetting the counts after each key/value pair in the training set.</p>  <p>Here's an example of code that's doing that.  help?</p>  <pre><code> public static void theTestingAlgorithm()     {         foreach (var testrecipe in Testing.sortedTestingData)         {             Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; runningNumbers = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();             foreach(var learningRecipe in MakeData.SortedData)             {                 runningNumbers.Add(learningRecipe.Key, 0);             }                             foreach(var testIngredient in testrecipe.Value)             {                 foreach(var learningRecipe in MakeData.SortedData)                 {                     if (learningRecipe.Value.Contains&lt;string&gt;(testIngredient))                     {                         runningNumbers[learningRecipe.Key]++;                     }                 }             }                    string answer = evaluatetest(runningNumbers);             runningNumbers.Clear();             Answers.Add(testrecipe.Key, answer);         }     } </code></pre>
