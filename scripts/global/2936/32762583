<pre><code>for(int i=0;i&lt;resultset.length;i++) { a = select meta_value from wp_postmeta where meta_key ='movie name' and post_id = resultset(i) } resultset = (select object_id from wp_term_relationships where term_taxonomy_id = (select term_taxonomy_id from wp_term_taxonomy where taxonomy = 'actors' and term_id = (Select term_id from wp_terms where name = 'Aamir khan'))   for(int i=0;i&lt;resultset.length;i++) { b = select meta_value from wp_postmeta where meta_key ='movie name' and post_id = resultset(i) } resultset = (select object_id from wp_term_relationships where term_taxonomy_id = (select term_taxonomy_id from wp_term_taxonomy where taxonomy = 'actors' and term_id = (Select term_id from wp_terms where name = 'Salman khan')) </code></pre>  <p>the value for a &amp; b are the names of the movies done by these actors, i just want to compare these two, and if there is any common movie then it will display that. If i am not on the write path then please tell me the right path. This has to be done on wordpress</p>
