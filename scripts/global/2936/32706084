<p>I am working on my first real project within R and ran into a problem. I am trying to compare 2 columns within 2 different data.frames. I tried running the code,</p>  <pre><code>matrix1 = matrix for (i in 1:2000){   if(data.QW[i,1] == data.RS[i,1]){     matrix1[i,1]== "True"   }   else{     matrix1[i,1]== "False"   } } </code></pre>  <p>I got this error:</p>  <pre><code>Error in Ops.factor(data.QW[i,1], data.RS[i,1]) :    level sets of factors are different </code></pre>  <p>I think this may be because QW and RS have different row lengths. But I am trying to see where these errors might be within the different data.frames and fix them according to the source document.</p>  <p>I am also unsure if matrix will work for this or if I need to make it into a vector and rbind it into the matrix every time.</p>  <p>Any good readings on this would also be appreciated.</p>
