<p>I have an ObservableCollection of researchers. Researchers who are staff members supervise students. Researchers who are students have a supervisor_id field. Everyone researcher has an id field.</p>  <p>I want to be able to count the number of supervisions a staff member has. So how do I use LINQ to go through every item and find if the supervisor field is equal to an ID field of a staff member?</p>  <p>Staff members have a supervisor_id field, but it is set to 0 since they don't have supervisors.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Ok I have these two in an Researcher class. I have more fields than this but that isn't important.</p>  <pre><code> public int id { get; set; }  public int supervisor_id { get; set; } </code></pre>  <p>I then have a SQL function which grabs all the info I need from a database.</p>  <p>Here is a picture of the database: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0QTFj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0QTFj.png" alt="Database"></a></p>  <p>So now I want to be able to count how many supervisions a staff member has.</p>
