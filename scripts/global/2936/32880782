<p>I just started learning programming and i know my questions are silly, but i have spent too much time looking around without success. So here is what i was trying to do.</p>  <p>A program that will be comparing strings (all in lower case alphabets), a line can have more than 1 word and words are separated by a space. Each line is used for comparision, then words in next line are compared separately. Here is the example of user input:</p>  <p><strong>china paris moscow antarctica</strong></p>  <p><strong>land water air</strong></p>  <p><strong>aluminium iron</strong></p>  <p>those three lines above will be used to compare words in those lines and output a result, line 1 will be comparing word china paris moscow antarctica, line two will compare word land water air, and same goes for line 3..... Program terminates when result is output and BTW user may enter more than 3 lines, (no limit) Apologies for not knowing much.</p>
