<p>I have two CSV files that I want to compare one looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>"a" 1   6   3   1   8 "b" 15  6   12  5   6 "c" 7   4   1   4   8 "d" 14  8   12  11  4 "e" 1   8   7   13  12 "f" 2   5   4   13  9 "g" 8   6   9   3   3 "h" 5   12  8   2   3 "i" 5   9   2   11  11 "j" 1   9   2   4   9 </code></pre>  <p>So "a" possesses the numbers 1,6,3,1,8 etc. The actual CSV file is 1,000s of lines long so you know for efficiency sake when writing the code.</p>  <p>The second CSV file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>4  15  7  9  2 </code></pre>  <p>I have written some code to import these CSV files into lists in python.</p>  <pre><code>with open('winningnumbers.csv', 'rb') as wn:     reader = csv.reader(wn)     winningnumbers = list(reader)  wn1 = winningnumbers[0] wn2 = winningnumbers[1] wn3 = winningnumbers[2] wn4 = winningnumbers[3] wn5 = winningnumbers[4]  print(winningnumbers)  with open('Entries#x.csv', 'rb') as en:     readere = csv.reader(en)     enl = list(readere) </code></pre>  <p>How would I now search cross reference number 4 so wn1 of CSV file 2 with the first csv file. So that it returns that "b" has wn1 in it. I imported them as a list to see if I could figure out how to do it but just ended up running in circles. I also tried using dict() but had no success.</p>
