<p><strong>I'm trying to read the contents of a file.</strong>  </p>  <p>In Python, it would be a one liner:</p>  <pre><code>seq_file = open('/some/local/file-path/on/computer.txt','r').read() print seq_file </code></pre>  <p>How can you write a one-liner in Swift to do the same thing? </p>  <p>My swift code to open a file (only works in terminal not in Playground):</p>  <pre><code>let seq_path = "/some/local/file-path/on/computer.txt" let file_manager = NSFileManager.defaultManager() let data: NSData = file_manager.contentsAtPath(seq_path)! let seq_file = NSString(data: data, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding) print(seq_file) </code></pre>  <p><strong>I'm not sure why reading is so much more complicated in Swift.  If someone would like to explain that would be extremely helpful.<br> I've read about the advantages of Swift...If it's so new and powerful, why would they make such a simple task so complicated?</strong> </p>  <p><em>Background (if anyone is interested): Undergrad in Biology, started learning Python in 2012 as my first programming language.  Use it to analyze biological data to this day.  Now I'm a graduate student and I've been getting a lot more interested in Computer Science over the years.  I would like to start writing programs for OSX and iOS and I thought a good way to learn the language was rewrite all my algorithms in Swift.</em> </p>
