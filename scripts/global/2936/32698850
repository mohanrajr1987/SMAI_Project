<p>Let's say I have two arrays that consist of hashes, structured similarly like this: </p>  <pre><code>array = [{:name =&gt; "John",              :surname =&gt; "Smith",              :family =&gt; {:mom =&gt; "Cathy",                          :father =&gt; "Joe"}           },{:name =&gt; "Kevin",              :surname =&gt; "Smith",              :family =&gt; {:mom =&gt; "Jessica",                          :father =&gt; "Bob"}           }] </code></pre>  <p>What is the best and fastest way to compare two arrays like this if both of them have about 10000 elements/people (hashes) in the array?</p>  <p>The hashes in the second array may not be in the same order as in first, but if the elements are same then the arrays are equal. Also the comparison should be able to locate the difference (if there is any) not only show that they are not equal. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
