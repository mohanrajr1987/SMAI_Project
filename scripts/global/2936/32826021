<p>I have a method [Order toJSON] that maps my class into a complex NSDictionary that have to be send to a server. To send it, I use <code>NSJsonSerialization</code> to convert it into a string.</p>  <p>The dictionary is of the form : </p>  <pre><code>@{    @"key": @"value",    @"order": @[      @{ @"name": @"obj1", @"content": @[ ... ] },     @{ @"name": @"obj2", @"content": @[ ... ] }   ]  } </code></pre>  <p>I am writing unit tests to check that the NSDictionary is correct. The problem is that I actually don't know the order of the arrays. I can have obj2 before obj1. When I am using <code>- [NSDictionary isEqualToDictionary]</code>, it sometimes fail due to the order of the objects. </p>  <p>Is there a way to compare those dictionaries without comparing the order of the arrays that it contains ? Sorting the array before may be an option, but it would be useless for anything else than testing, and it's quite complicated (and expensive).</p>
