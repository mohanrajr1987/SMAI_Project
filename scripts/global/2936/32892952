Same for the corpus.</p>  <p>list Ref  / list Corpus</p>  <pre><code>    public Canagram(string anagram, int frequency,int percentage)     {         anagram = Anagram;         // exemple "a"         frequency = Frequency;     // how many "a" in the txt          percentage = Percentage;   // what's the percentage compared to the other anagram     } </code></pre>  <p>The goal is to match each anagram on each list with the percentage and return the global percentage match between this two lists. </p>  <pre><code>    public static int percentage(List&lt;Canagram&gt; reference, List&lt;Canagram&gt; corpus)     {          //don"t know how to compare this two list properly and return % match          return (int) percentage of match;     } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
