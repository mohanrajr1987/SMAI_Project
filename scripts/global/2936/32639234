<p>I'm pretty new to coding, and completely self taught, so I often run into issues.  Usually I can search my way out but on this one I'm banging my head against the wall and I'm sure its something simple.  I'm building a call logger in google sheets and with the part of the code in question, my goal is, when a user marks "X" in the done column on their page, it finds the corresponding entry on the main page based on the original timestamp of the call and marks it done on the main page as well.  Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>    if( s.getName() == "Candice" ) { var r = s.getActiveCell(); if( r.getColumn() == 1){   if (r.getValue() == "x"){     r.setValue("X")   }   if (r.getValue() == "X"){     var nextCell = r.offset(0, 6);     nextCell.setValue(new Date());     nextCell.setNumberFormat('m/d/yyyy h:mm:ss');     var donedate = nextCell.getValue();     var ogdate = nextCell.offset(0, -1).getValue();     var matchdate = form.getRange('F:F').getValues();     for (var n=2; n&lt;matchdate.length; n++) {       Logger.log('ogdate is: ' + ogdate + ' and matchdate is: ' + matchdate[n][0])       if (matchdate[n][0] == ogdate){          form.getRange(n, 1).setValue("X")         form.getRange(n, 7).setValue(donedate)        }     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>} } Everything works up until the logger, and when I look at the log, I can see that ogdate does match one of the matchdate[n][0] entries, but the script doesnt make it to the last 2 lines.  (I put a logger after the 3rd to last line to just display "worked" and didn't see anything.  Any assistance would be super helpful!</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
