<p>I'm trying to catch when two points match (ie x co-ordinates the same, <code>ptA.x == ptB.x</code>, and the same for y). OpenCV docs say I should be able to do this just by comparing the points:</p>  <pre><code>Point2i ptA = Point(0,0); Point2i ptB = Point(160,120);  if(ptA == ptB); {       // Do something } </code></pre>  <p>However, my code in the <code>if</code> loop always executes, which means that <code>ptA == ptB</code> is always true, even if I know it's not.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong? What can I do to compare whether two points are the same?</p>
