<p>I understand that to sort integers, I need to pass a compare function to sort() like so:</p>  <pre><code>function(a, b){return a-b} </code></pre>  <p>But what I'm wondering is how this actually <em>works</em>.  Meaning, if the result of a-b is negative, then b is sorted ahead of a, and if a-b is positive, then a is sorted ahead of b?  Is that right?  What happens if a-b = 0?</p>
