<p>I have a few similar (not identical) images with the object (and sometimes additionally with fragments of the other one) which he is turned in the different ways, and I want him to be "straight" on each of them. In my program to do this I used <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/examples/find-image-rotation-and-scale-using-automated-feature-matching.html?prodcode=IP&amp;language=en" rel="nofollow">methods described here</a>.</p>  <p>The program works correctly, however in this method functions <code>detectSURFFeatures</code> and <code>estimateGeometricTransform</code> are used and <strong>older matlab version (2011)</strong> doesn't support them. My program must be compatible with 2011, so here is my question - <strong>how to solve a problem of the turnover without using these functions</strong>?</p>
