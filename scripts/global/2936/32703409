<p>I've problem with the EAV modeled database. I want to describe my problem with the example point.For example, I've got a <code>product | attribute | value</code> tables together. I need to compare those product attributes on the <code>attributes</code> and <code>values</code> tables. In the bad way, I can handle it with getting attribute values for each ID (primary key) value and I can check is it equal or not on the programming side. But is it effective way? Any other bussiness logic that could be work for those scenario? Any no-sql kind of db could be better to use those comparisons?</p>
