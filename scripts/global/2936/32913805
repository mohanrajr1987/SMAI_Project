<p>I am currently working on a little project, about n-gramme. For the moment, i obtain a list of anagramme with some text.txt</p>  <p>I have lists of French-Spanish-English anagramme with this property : </p>  <ul> <li>the name of the anagramme ( For example : "a" ," ' ", "- " ...)    </li> <li>the frequency of the anagramme in the txt ("e" appears 500 times in the txt),         </li> <li>the percentage of appearance (for exemple : "e" for the french.txt got 13%).</li> </ul>  <p>My question is how can i build a feature hashing from each list of anagramme, then to compare this hash with other text.txt; to finally know which langage is used in the text.txt.</p>  <p>For example :</p>  <pre><code>frenchanagram.gethash() = 1563333 spanishanagram.gethash() = 458888 englishanagram.gethash() = 800666 text.anagram.gethash() = 1574562 </code></pre>  <p>-> Conclude -> Text's langage is french.</p>  <p>Thanks for watching my probleme and for the futur help.</p>
