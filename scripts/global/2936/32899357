<p>Hi guys so I've been working on this code to perform comparing multiple columns across two different worksheet in the same workbook. It would first match products based on their product ID (Which is found in one column) and compare several of its of data. (In multiple columns).  For example, this is found in the first worksheet called "raw":</p>  <pre>    (Column E)   (Column F)   (Column G)  (Column H)  (Column Z)   (Column AA)  (Column AB)    Product ID       xx          xx           xx       USD Price    SGD Price    HKD price       S123          xx          xx           xx         $1.12345    $1.46786     $1.8908       S124          xx          xx           xx         $2.12345    $2.5331      $2.8428       </pre>  <p>While this can be found in the second worksheet "table":</p>  <pre>    (Column H)   (Column I)   (Column J)  (Column K)  (Column S)   (Column T)  (Column U)    Product ID       xx          xx           xx       USD Price    SGD Price    HKD price       S123          xx          xx           xx         $1.12346    $1.46786    $1.8910       S124          xx          xx           xx         $2.12345    $2.5351     $2.8428 </pre>  <p>It should match the product ID and compare columns Z, AA, AB in "raw" worksheet with columns S,T,U in "table" worksheet and copy the entire row into a different worksheet, named "Mismatch". It should also be able to highlight the field that is different in the two worksheet. So in this case, it should copy the entire S123 and S124 row, highlight the cell "1.12346", "1.8910" and "$2.5351" in red.</p>  <p>My existing code now only compares a single column and copies the row into the "Mismatch" worksheet, in this case columns Z and S. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub compare() Dim wS As Worksheet, wT As Worksheet Dim r1 As Range, r2 As Range Dim cel1 As Range, cel2 As Range  Set wS = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("raw") Set wT = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("table")  With wS     Set r1 = .Range("E1", .Cells(.Rows.Count, .Columns("E:E").Column).End(xlUp)) End With  With wT     Set r2 = .Range("H1", .Cells(.Rows.Count, .Columns("H:H").Column).End(xlUp)) End With  On Error Resume Next For Each cel1 In r1     With Application         Set cel2 = .Index(r2, .Match(cel1.Value, r2, 0)) 'find match in sheet2         If Err = 0 Then             If cel1.Offset(, 21) &lt;&gt; cel2.Offset(, 11) Then copyRow cel2 'if difference, copy         End If         Err.Clear     End With Next cel1 End Sub  Sub copyRow(cel As Range)     Dim w As Worksheet, r As Range     Set w = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Mismatch")     Set r = w.Cells(w.Rows.Count, Columns("E:E").Column).End(xlUp).Offset(1) 'next row     cel.EntireRow.Copy w.Cells(r.Row, 1)     cel2.Interior.Color = vbRed End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Is it hence possible to accomplish the following? </p>  <ol> <li><p>Compare columns Z ,AA ,AB against S, T, U and copy all rows with difference into "Mismatch" worksheet.</p></li> <li><p>Highlight the cells that is different : $1.12346, $1.8910, $2.5351</p></li> <li><p>Because these value are in decimal, a slight difference in decimal would flag a different. I would like to set a tolerance level (for example, if difference is &lt;0.01, consider them as the same.</p></li> </ol>  <p>I know the whole thing sound really confusing, but any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!</p>
