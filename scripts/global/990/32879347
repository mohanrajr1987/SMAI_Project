<p>I have a list (list.txt)</p>  <pre><code>E001    Apples    Good stuff E002    Pears    Nicely done E091    Grapes    Bleah </code></pre>  <p>I wanted to create directories using the first column so I tried</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/sh for num in $(seq 1 3) #Because the list is long do cat list.txt | cut -f1 | awk 'NR==$num{print}' &gt; idx.tmp idx=$(idx.tmp) mkdir $idx rm idx.tmp done </code></pre>  <p>Not only is this conceivably bulky, it doesn't work - even though <code>cat list.txt | cut -f1 | awk 'NR==1 {print}'</code> gives me the name of the individual directory I want (i.e. E001)</p>  <p>Ideally I wish to obtain a bunch of empty folders created within the folder which the script ran (does that sound right?) named using the first column of each row in <code>list.txt</code>.</p>
