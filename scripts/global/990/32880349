<p>I have a file with *.xvg format.<br> It contains six columns with 500 numbers each.<br> Except the time column (first column) all other columns contain floats.  </p>  <p>I want to generate an output file in same format, in which these columns are converted into rows with each number separated by space.</p>  <p>I have written a program in C, which works fine for me but I am looking for an alternative way using awk or sed, which will allow me to do the same.</p>  <p>I am absolutely new to these scripting languages. I couldn't find any relevant answer for me in previously asked questions. So, If somebody can help me out with this task I will be grateful.</p>  <p>Input file looks like this :-</p>  <pre><code>  # This file was created Thu Oct  1 17:18:10 2015   # by the following command:   # /home/durba/gmx455/bin/mdrun -np 1 -deffnm md0 -v    #   @    title "dH/d\xl\f{}, \xD\f{}H"   @    xaxis  label "Time (ps)"   @    yaxis  label "(kJ/mol)"   @TYPE xy   @ subtitle "T = 200 (K), \xl\f{} = 0"   @ view 0.15, 0.15, 0.75, 0.85   @ legend on   @ legend box on   @ legend loctype view   @ legend 0.78, 0.8   @ legend length 2   @ s0 legend "dH/d\xl\f{} \xl\f{} 0"   @ s1 legend "\xD\f{}H \xl\f{} 0.05"   0  19.3191 1.16531   1.8   -447.07  -47.07   2 -447.072 -17.6454  1.5   -17.633  -1.33   4 -17.633 -0.446508  1.3   -75.455  -5.45   6 -75.4555 -2.83981  1.4   -28.724  -28.4   8 -28.7246 -0.884639 1.5   -41.877  -14.87   10 -41.8779 -1.45569  2.8   -43.685  -3.685   12 -43.6851 -1.4797   -3.1  -91.651  -91.651   14 -91.6515 -3.52492  -3.5  -61.135  -1.135   16 -61.1356 -2.30129  -3.2  -48.847  -48.47 </code></pre>  <p>output file should look like this :- </p>  <pre><code>  # This file was created Thu Oct  1 17:18:10 2015   # by the following command:   # /home/durba/gmx455/bin/mdrun -np 1 -deffnm md0 -v    #   @    title "dH/d\xl\f{}, \xD\f{}H"   @    xaxis  label "Time (ps)"   @    yaxis  label "(kJ/mol)"   @TYPE xy   @ subtitle "T = 200 (K), \xl\f{} = 0"   @ view 0.15, 0.15, 0.75, 0.85   @ legend on   @ legend box on   @ legend loctype view   @ legend 0.78, 0.8   @ legend length 2   @ s0 legend "dH/d\xl\f{} \xl\f{} 0"   @ s1 legend "\xD\f{}H \xl\f{} 0.05"   0  2  4 6 8 10 12    19.3191 -447.072 -17.633 -17.633 -75.4555 -28.7246 -41.8779 -43.6851 -91.6515 -61.1356   1.16531 -17.6454 -0.446508 -2.83981 -0.884639 -1.45569 -1.4797 -3.52492 -2.30129   1.8 1.5 1.3 1.4 1.5 2.8 -3.1 -3.5 -3.2   -447.07 -17.633 -75.455 -28.724 -41.877 -43.685 -91.651 -61.135 -48.847   -47.07 -1.33 -5.45 -28.4 -14.87 -3.685 -91.651 -1.135 -48.47 </code></pre>  <p>Please note that lines starting with "#" and "@" should be the same in both files.</p>
