<p>I am using the following line to get the line number in which a specific string occurs : </p>  <pre><code>nLine=$(awk '/text/{ print NR; exit }' $1) echo "line = $nline" </code></pre>  <p>returns :</p>  <pre><code>line = 78 </code></pre>  <p>Now, I would like to replace this specific line with an other string by using :</p>  <pre><code>awk 'NR==$nLine {$0="new text $2"} 1' test.xml </code></pre>  <p>Where $2 is a param given to the bash script.</p>  <p>This command line works fine when it is enter directly into the terminal or when I put the parameter as :</p>  <pre><code>awk 'NR==78 {$0="new text data"} 1' test.xml </code></pre>  <p>but it never works as expected when parameters are given to the command..</p>  <p>In addition, is it possible to avoid the print in the terminal ? Because when I put > /dev/null at the end of the line nothing appends. </p>
