<p>I'd like to take a list like this:</p>  <pre><code>example.com 1.2.3.4 ftp.example.com 2.3.4.5 3.4.5.6 www.example.com 4.5.6.7 5.6.7.8 6.7.8.9 </code></pre>  <p>And parse into a comma delimited CSV format so that when opened in a popular spreadsheet program, the parent FQDNs are in column A and the children IPs are in column B.</p>  <p>I'd like to do this using native Linux binaries so I can bake into an existing BASH script.</p>  <p>Any help welcome, and thanks in advance.</p>
