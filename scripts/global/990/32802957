<p>I'm running a program that outputs lines like these (simplified):</p>  <pre><code>A E E R E </code></pre>  <p>etc... And I'm trying to find the longest occurrence of the letter code E without something else in between. I suspect the easiest way would be to try looking for N consecutive where I try a couple descending values for N but I'm not sure how to do a specific case, say 3 consecutive E lines. Is this easy with a sed command? I thought of awk pattern range but it allows for anything in between.. </p>
