<p>I have a txt file with 3 rows, now I want to multiply a variable value with the 2nd column. Given below is my requirement.</p>  <pre><code>cat sample.txt     ABC,123,qwe123     ASD,456,asd123     VBN,6532,wqe123 </code></pre>  <p>I have a variable, colum=100. I want to multiply this variable with 2nd column using awk. The code I tried is:</p>  <pre><code>cat sample.txt | awk -F , '{print $1","$2*$($colum)","$3}'  My expected output is:         ABC,12300,qwe123         ASD,45600,asd123         VBN,653200,wqe123 </code></pre>  <p>Please note that I want to perform this awk using the variable only, I dont want to directly multiply column 2 with 100.</p>
