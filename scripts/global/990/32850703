<p>I was hoping to transpose a file from wide to long format preferably using a linux statement or a python statement. My input data would look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>   head1 M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7    abcd A B C D E F G    efgh A B C D E F G    ijkl A B C D E F G </code></pre>  <p>and would like the output to be like this:</p>  <pre><code>   abcd A    abcd B    abcd C    abcd E    abcd F    abcd G    efgh A    efgh B    efgh C    ... </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to do this, I have come across R code but would prefer to avoid using it as the files are quite large?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
