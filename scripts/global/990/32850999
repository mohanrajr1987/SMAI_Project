<p>Hi i have to run a automated script for a in-house command of us . the  command will list subnets and also give info of each subnet through various options  here i had listed the subnets and then greped the names, then checked the info of each subnet and now for each subnet i need to check if dhcp is set to none and we dont have anything mentioned as none it is just "dhcp:"   now i need to see if the value is none in the output as like dhcp:  not as dhcp:x.x.x.x or dhcp:test.server.com. how can we do that :</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash cat subnet list | cut -f 2 -d '|' |egrep -v "NAME|^-" |awk '{print $1}' |while read NAME    do if  cat subnet info --name $NAME | grep 'DHCP:' |  awk '{ print $2 }' &lt;  /dev/null then echo dhcp is set to none else echo "dhcp is set to a value" fi done fi  done </code></pre>  <p>Here the if statement is wrong because when there is value <code>cat subnet info --name $NAME | grep 'DHCP:' |  awk '{ print $2 }'</code> it shows the value but if loop still shows none</p>
