<p>I have a file (old.dat) which has let's say 20 columns. Now, I want a different file (new.dat) containing 2 columns namely x and y say, where y is the sum of all the even columns of old.dat file i.e., y = $2+$4+$6+...(of the old.dat file, X will remain same )</p>  <p>Is there any efficient way to write a 'awk' command for this purpose?  N.B. I don't want to write every time $2+$4+$6 like this, may be a variable instead?</p>  <p>old.dat:</p>  <pre><code>-36.0331 1 -36.0331 2 -36.0331 3 -36.0331 2 -36.0331 1 -36.0331 2 </code></pre>  <p>new.dat (desired one)</p>  <pre><code>-36.0331  11  </code></pre>  <p>this is just the one row of the file. </p>
