<p>I have an awk script that runs on specific log files.  Initially we ran this on the machine that generates the log files so all was good, I just basically at the end of the script pointed to the local directory and file I need it to run on, for example:  /logs/logfile1</p>  <p>But now, I've added several other machines to help load balance our application, so each time a particular machine is accessed (in round robin fashion) that machine writes its own log file local to that machine.  </p>  <p>How do I get the script to run on one machine but access the log files from all of the other machines as well?  (I could copy the script and run locally on each of the machines and append the outputs to one file as there are only 5 machines right now, but I figure there is an easier solution).</p>  <p>Also I run CentOS 6.x on these servers if that is helpful</p>  <p>EDIT:  I suppose I could create soft links to the other machines, on the machine that is running the script.  Just wondering if there is something easier?</p>
