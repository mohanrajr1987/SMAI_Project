<p>I wrote the following code:</p>  <pre><code>success="Traffic Engineering Tunnel validated successfully" text=$(tail -2 /apps/pofitb/logs/tunnels.log) echo $executed_date if  [[ $text = $success ]] then     text=$(tail -2 /apps/pofitb/logs/tunnels.log)     echo "Tunnel script execution is successful" | mailx -s "Tunnel script is executed succefsfully on $executed_date" abc@gmail.com  else     echo "Tunnel script  lastly executed  on $executed_date" | mailx -s "Tunnel script  FAILED!!!" abc@gmail.com  fi exit </code></pre>  <p>Currently tunnel.log file has blank line while being updated. So, <code>text=$(tail -2 /apps/pofitb/logs/tunnels.log)</code> extracts the last non-blank line from the end of the file. This works if the number of blank line inserted at the end of the file is 1. </p>  <p>How can I modify the script such that the script searches for the last last non-blank line from the file tunnel.log, irrespective of the number of blank lines inserted ?</p>
