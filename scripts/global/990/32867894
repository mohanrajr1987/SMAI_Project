<p>Okay so I've got a few test entries which are running for quite some time now, and I could get the start time from logs </p>  <pre><code>Tue Sep 29 09:21:39 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 09:58:12 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 09:58:58 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 10:36:46 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 11:10:26 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 11:52:35 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 12:19:37 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 13:02:04 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 13:55:41 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 13:56:11 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 13:56:17 UTC 2015: INFO: Tue Sep 29 13:56:21 UTC 2015: INFO: </code></pre>  <p>I am looking to get the time different between subsequent entries, which probably is going to give me the time taken by each test to execute. are there any built-in awk commands that I can make use of to convert these to epoch so I can calculate difference quite easily?</p>  <p>what would be a better approach? single line command would be great.</p>
