<p>I am trying to change the date format of text within a file. eg from D24/09/15 to D09/24/15. I have tried multiple SED and AWK methods without success, i think because i am on OSX. Can anyone pls offer a suggestion?</p>  <p>many thanks</p>  <p>a sample extract is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>^ D24/09/15 T-99.90 PTEXT AND MORETXT  9146410 ^ ^ D16/05/15 T-89.90 PTEXT AND MORETXT  9146411 ^ </code></pre>
