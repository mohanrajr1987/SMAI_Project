<p>I have a bibtex file (exported from Zotero) and I want to clean it by removing particular fields.</p>  <p>As an example, removing the <em>file</em> field from the following entry:</p>  <pre><code>@inproceedings{sridharan_fast_2008,     title = {Fast {Rates} for {Regularized} {Objectives}.},     urldate = {2014-03-26},     booktitle = {{NIPS}},     author = {Sridharan, Karthik and Shalev-Shwartz, Shai and Srebro, Nathan},     year = {2008},     pages = {1545--1552},     file = {3400-fast-rates-for-regularized-objectives.pdf:/home/johnros/.zotero/zotero/66g0wvis.default/zotero/storage/6ND67P5F/3400-fast-rates-for-regularized-objectives.pdf:application/pdf} } </code></pre>
