<p>I trying to update my local copy with TFS server project. Currently there is no workspace mapping (I have deleted the previous mapping) in my current copy.  Now i have create a new workspace and mapped it with the same Local copy. </p>  <p>Now, whenever i am trying to run the TFS get command it says some local file is writable, therefore the checkout is getting failed.</p>  <p><strong>ERROR:</strong></p>  <pre><code>/project/Test/css/v2/scss/utilities.scss: Local file     /protextsoftwarescan1/project/Test/css/v2/scss/utilities.scss is writable /project/Test/css/v2/utilities.css: Local file /protextsoftwarescan1/project/Test/css/v2/utilities.css is writable </code></pre>
