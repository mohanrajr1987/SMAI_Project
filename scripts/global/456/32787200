<p>Following situation: I have a git repo with a lot of commits, and I want to remove a file that was introduced in a commit changed in a few and finally deleted in a commit. So now I want to remove the commit completely from my repo and therefore did:</p>  <p><code> git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch UNWANTED_FILE' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all </code> <code> git push -f origin master </code></p>  <p>This worked great and my history was rewritten (several commits were rewritten. However:</p>  <p><code> git log --all -- UNWANTED_FILE </code></p>  <p>I still get two entries showing up, namely the commits were nothing else than removing the file and adding the file was done.</p>  <p>Alll the other commits were other things were done as well are completely gone. How can I remove the last traces of these commits as well?</p>
