<p>I am using Python 2.7 </p>  <p>I am trying to <code>pip install</code> a repo (on internal github) that has a dependency on another repo(also on internal github).</p>  <p>I tried several options but the one that worked was like this:</p>  <pre><code>(env)abc$ cat requirements.txt  -e git://github.abc.com/abc/abc.git#egg=my_abc --process-dependency-links  (env)abc$ pip  install -r requirements.txt </code></pre>  <p>But I got a warning while running the command line  that said:</p>  <p><em>"DEPRECATION: Dependency Links processing has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release."</em></p>  <p>I am on pip v7.1.2. What is the right way to do this ?</p>
