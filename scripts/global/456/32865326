<p>We want to clean up our database schema and drop/delete objects which are no longer being used.</p>  <p>We suspect that sometime in the future we'll want to resurrect the removed functionality.</p>  <p>We've discussed the following options for dealing with dropped objects in version control:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Deleting the .sql files from source control once they are gone from the database and relying on the version history to store the definitions. Our concern with this approach is that sometime over the years source control will be moved and we will lose the history. It also seems difficult to know what to look for to recover if we can't see all the dropped objects.</p></li> <li><p>Leaving the .sql files in source control but updating the definitions to "drop proc {someproc}". With this approach we our concerned about leaving the objects in version control which no longer exists and also the risk to losing the history if the vcs was moved</p></li> <li><p>Creating a new repo for dropped objects and migrating .sql files to this repo once they have been dropped from SQL Server.</p></li> </ol>  <p>We're working in a windows environment and are fairly new to working with VCS for databases. Currently GIT + SSDT.</p>  <p>Currently option 3 is our preferred approach.</p>
