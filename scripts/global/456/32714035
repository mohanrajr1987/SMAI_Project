<p>Have got a weird issue with GIT. We run with a UAT branch and a Master branch, and after every software release, we merge UAT into Master, so every release is stored on the master branch. </p>  <p>The path before this releases' merge looks as follows:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jn5plOZ.png" alt="Before Merge"></p>  <p>The only difference is that we have a 3rd branch, pw-hash, which is a major change to the system, so is on it's own branch whilst other developers work on day to day bug fixes etc. </p>  <p>I do the usual </p>  <pre><code>    git checkout master     git merge uat </code></pre>  <p>And then that's where it gets funky. Below is what I get after the merge </p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7j9AFMV.png" alt="Afer Merge"></p>  <p>The migration is from when we have (fairly recently) moved from TFS to GIT for source control. </p>  <p>I have reset the head of the master branch back to the previous merge so it looks fine again, but we need to do the merge so we can checkin more work.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any ideas as I can't push that and leave the history like that. I was expecting more like the before image but with another node on the master branch...</p>
