<p>In the following command and explanation, what does the qualifier "<strong><em>atomic</em></strong>" mean in "<strong><em>atomic</em> snapshots</strong>"? My best guess from the context is something akin to granularity?</p>  <pre><code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;  # Move the current branch tip backward to &lt;commit&gt;, reset the staging  # area to match, but leave the working directory alone. All changes made  # since &lt;commit&gt; will reside in the working directory, which lets you  # re-commit the project history using cleaner, more atomic snapshots. </code></pre>
