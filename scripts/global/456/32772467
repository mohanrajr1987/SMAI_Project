<p>I've made a number of commits to a Git branch, synched them to the repository, and then checked out a fresh copy of the branch onto another computer using:</p>  <pre><code>git checkout </code></pre>  <p>however the latest change that I'm seeing on the 2nd computer is a few steps behind the version on the 1st computer. I've tried a:</p>  <pre><code>git reset --hard head </code></pre>  <p>on the branch, on the 2nd computer. What is happening?</p>
