<p>I'm extremely new to ClearCase and am trying to do a deliver operation on a project I'm working on. The problem is, I continually see the following happen during the delivery:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/difNH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/difNH.png" alt="Eror Popup"></a></p>  <p>Obviously this isn't too helpful of an error message... I use the default deliver for this, and I'd say this happens ever 10-20 minutes, when I hit OK it closes the whole thing and I have to resume the operation, only for this to happen again. I've been trying to complete it for a few days now, and I'm starting to suspect that it may not be doing anything in between these errors.</p>  <p>Has anyone else ever seen this error before? Anyone know how to fix it? If you need any other info let me know -- as I said, very new to ClearCase.</p>
