<p>I know that in git you can use <code>-</code> to refer to the previous branch you were on.</p>  <p>So for example, if I'm in the <code>tester</code> branch and run <code>git checkout master</code>, then decide I want to go back to <code>tester</code>, I could run <code>git checkout -</code> instead of <code>git checkout tester</code>.</p>  <h3>My question is this:</h3>  <p>Is there some kind of syntactic sugar in git that allows me to reference the <strong>current branch</strong> I'm in?</p>  <p>So for instance, if I'm in <code>master</code> and want to run <code>git pull origin master</code>, could I run instead <code>git pull origin {current branch sugar}</code>?</p>  <p>It's mostly just getting annoying having to specify the current branch name for common commands like <code>push</code>, <code>pull</code>, etc.</p>
