<p>I'm trying to commit my changes to the repository server (using CVS) in Eclipse Kepler, but when I do I get the following error which I've never seen before:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The server reported an error while performing the "cvs commit"   command. ProsperityMobile: cvsntsrv server: sticky tag <code>1.6' for file   </code>src/com/prosperity/mobile/controller/UserController.java' is not a   branch ProsperityMobile: cvsntsrv server: sticky tag <code>1.14' for file   </code>src/com/prosperity/mobile/service/UserService.java' is not a branch   ProsperityMobile: cvsntsrv [server aborted]: correct above errors   first!</p> </blockquote>  <p>And honestly I don't even know where to start trouble shooting this or what it even means. Any point in the right direction would really be appreciated! </p>
