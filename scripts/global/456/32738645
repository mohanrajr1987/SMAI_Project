<p>I recently updated to XCode7. And just noticed this new file <code>ObjectiveC.gcno</code> in my project's root. My go-to source for gitignore files doesn't have it ignored. <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/github/gitignore</a> </p>  <p>It seems to be some sort of build artifact, but not sure. Should it be ignored??</p>  <p>My project has both Objective-C and Swift code together.</p>
