<p>I know locking files or directories in git can be problematic. But right now we have had a few developers working on a project in git and they have edited the core files for a web application like Magento or Wordpress. We were then faced with issues when upgrading or using third party plugins because the core files/directories were modified. </p>  <p>Is there a way in git to lock certain files and directories to prevent developers from editing core files? Or is there a better method to stop developers from editing core files? We will need a way to unlock them so we can perform upgrades. </p>
