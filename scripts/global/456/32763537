<p>I'm creating automated builds using gated check ins. But we have a few projects that are referencing other web applications outside of the source directory. So we have a project called 'PolicyRating.sln', which is in our 'Client' folder in source control. It's referencing 5 other projects in our 'CoreFramework' project collection, when I try to deploy it out to our QA server, it's unable to find the referenced projects on the build server. It can't find the project files. Is there a way to build a project that references other projects outside the source directory? I'm using TFS 2013</p>
