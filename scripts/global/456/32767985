<p>So I originally cloned a repo thinking I wouldn't make changes and eventually decided to fork my own copy for personal use (it's a dotfiles repo). If I want to continue changes from the fork, what's the cleanest way to copy local commits from the original clone over to the forked repo?</p>  <p>Looked around and couldn't find exactly what I want here.</p>  <p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>  <p>I have two repos now on my computer, one that's a clone of the original repo, and another a fork from the same repo. I made changes to the clone, but am hoping to move these local commits over to the fork.</p>
