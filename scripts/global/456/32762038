<p>We are very new to using Visual Studio Online.  After some discussion we have decided to not keep our web.config files in the cloud.  It was easy enough to remove it from the project, however, the file still exists in the changesets and history.  Is there a way to wipe it from the cloud either through the website or visual studio?  We are using 2015.  Thanks.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> We are using Team Foundation Version Control.  </p>
