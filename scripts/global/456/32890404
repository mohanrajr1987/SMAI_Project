<p>I'm in a project with 2 other developers.<br> A short while back one of the other devs tried to create a new testing branch. He figured that he didn't know Git well enough to keep merging stuff and moved back to using the trunk. Since then Git went all wonky.</p>  <p>We now have 3 branches(?), or a trunk and 2 branches.<br> <code>HEAD</code>, <code>master</code> and <code>origin/master</code>.</p>  <p>Which of these branches is the trunk (assuming <code>HEAD</code>), and how can we prevent our commits from entering the wrong branch?<br> Note that the approach to pushing hasn't changed. All we do is locally commit our changes, then push them to our Git server. We do that every single time, and still it manages to sometimes push to the wrong branch. This is all done from Intellij, no command line Git is used.</p>  <p>How to prevent this behaviour from happening? We just want to use the trunk to host our code. We're done with Git going wonky :p</p>  <p>Below screenshot should explain the current situation.<br> We have 3 developers, <code>Bas</code> <code>p</code> and <code>w</code>. I have removed the useless commit messages from this screenshot</p>  <p>Notice that at one point (in the early commits) we all committed to <code>HEAD</code>, while shortly after that <code>p</code> suddenly committed to <code>origin/master</code> and it wasn't on the same life line as <code>HEAD</code> anymore. This caused conflicts and the need to merge those branches.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KmSxH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KmSxH.png" alt="git lifelines in Intellij"></a></p>  <p>In short;<br> Which branch is the actual trunk and how to make sure that no commits accidently enter a wrong branch? Is this an issue of Intellij, Git or our own configuration?</p>
