<p>In Mercurial (hg), a user can enter the following command --</p>  <pre><code>hg log --branch branchName </code></pre>  <p>This shows only the commits which were done against a specific named branch.</p>  <p>What bzr command can give me the same functionality? I could not find an option for "bzr log" that would do the same thing. For example, if I committed revs 1, 2, and 3 in branch nick "trunk" and 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 4 in branch nick "ftr-foo", how can I print only the revs under branch nick "ftr-foo" such that I'd only see 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 4? And how would I get only the commits which were done against the "trunk" branch nick such that I'd only see 1, 2, and 3?</p>  <p>DAG graph below.</p>  <pre><code>4 [ftr-foo] |  \ 3   \ [trunk] |    \ |     2.1.2 [ftr-foo] |      | |     2.1.1 [ftr-foo] |   / |  / 2 [trunk] | 1 [trunk] </code></pre>
