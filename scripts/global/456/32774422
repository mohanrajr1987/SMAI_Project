<p>I used Xcode source control to connect with SVN server.</p>  <p>After check out the source, I executed the "commit", "update", all work fine.</p>  <p>But when I click <strong>Source Control > History</strong>, and click show modified files, then show an alert dialog:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The source control operation failed,because no working copy could be found.</p>      <p>Make sure the file is in a valid working copy and try again.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any advice is appreciated, thanks.</p>
