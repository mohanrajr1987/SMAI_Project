<p>I've got a folder restructuring project which is going to take an extended period of time. The restructuring will have breaking changes and cannot occur in trunk.  So the goal will be create a new Branch and keep it parallel to trunk, merging down changes down from trunk on a periodic basis.</p>  <p>I've attempted a few different merge methods, but i'm not able to get changes from Trunk down to the Branch on files that have moved in the Branch.</p>  <h3>Trunk Structure</h3>  <pre> `+- /trunk     +- /foo         +- /bar             - bar.php` </pre>  <h3>Branch Structure (after svn move on /bar directory)</h3>  <pre> `+- /branch     +- /foo     +- /newdir         +- /bar             - bar.php` </pre>  <h3>Steps</h3>  <ul> <li>Branched Trunk via an svn copy</li> <li>Created a new directory in Branch, /newdir</li> <li>Performed svn move on /bar directory in Branch, moving it from /foo to /newdir</li> <li>Modified bar.php in Trunk</li> <li>Tried a few different types of merges, but none will merge changes from trunk bar.php to the branch bar.php</li> </ul>  <h3>Info</h3>  <ul> <li>Using subversion 1.8.11</li> <li>Branch does not need to be re-integrated to Trunk</li> </ul>  <h3>Question</h3>  <p>Is there any way to move files in the Branch and allow for Trunk changes to be reflected in the moved files?</p>
