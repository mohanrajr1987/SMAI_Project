<p>I have created a <code>nuget.config</code> file and placed it in the solution root for my project(s).</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;configuration&gt;     &lt;config&gt;         &lt;add key="repositorypath" value="..\packages" /&gt;         &lt;solution&gt;             &lt;add key="disableSourceControlIntegration" value="true" /&gt;         &lt;/solution&gt;     &lt;/config&gt; &lt;/configuration&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I build the project with VS2015, everything runs fine. It downloads the nuget packages, but does not attempt to add them to source control. However, when I try to run the same project build in VS2013, with a clean build (i.e. no packages), it will download them successfully, but always adds them to source.</p>  <p>VS1013 has the Nuget v2.8.60723.765 extension installed - and no updates are listed as available from extension manager. I had read that there <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/980" rel="nofollow">was a problem</a> with this feature, but that appears to be in v3 (and has been fixed in 3.2).</p>  <p>I have attempted to place the config file both in the solution root (which apparently should work) <em>and</em> in a .nuget folder off the solution root. Neither solution solved the issue.</p>  <p>Am I missing something in the config file that would allow VS2013 to <em>not</em> add these package folders to source control?</p>
