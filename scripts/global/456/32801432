<p>I am building a Debian package from a source tarball. The initial <code>debian</code> directory is created with <code>dh_make</code>.</p>  <p>It creates a directory <code>debian</code> in the directory my tarball was extracted to. I then customize the content of the <code>debian</code> directory to fit my packaging needs. Then I build the package with <code>dpkg-buildpackage -b</code>.</p>  <p>My question is: What is the best (canonical?) way to put the contents of the customized <code>debian</code> directory in version control? </p>  <p>Do I just copy it out of the source directory, keep it in version control somewhere and every time I built, I extract the tarball and copy the directory back?</p>
