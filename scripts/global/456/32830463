<p>I have a (potentially public) development branch for a Haskell project that I also release to Haddock. The head of my release branch always (naturally) has a <code>.cabal</code> file with a version corresponding to the current Haddock version. </p>  <p>But what version should I have in the <code>.cabal</code> file on my development branch? For example, after releasing version <code>0.1.2.6</code> on Hackage, no subsequent commit anywhere (esp. along a development branch) is version <code>0.1.2.6</code>, nor are they (yet) <code>0.1.2.7</code>. What version should such commits be? Is there a standard practice, either for Hackage in particular, or source control in general (recalling that Cabal imposes restrictions on the values that <code>version</code> can take)? </p>
