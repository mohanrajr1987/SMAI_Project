<p>I'm aware that you can enable Informatica's own brand of version control for repository mappings/objects and this seems to work reasonably well, if developers don't mind the encumbrance of checking mappings/objects out using the tool.</p>  <p>My question is it considered a good/bad idea to run git (or a 3rd party vc of your choice) on the repository xml directly, outside of the tool control?</p>
