<p>I'm trying to figure out whether a merge conflict was responsible for a bug, but I'm having difficulty because I'm not clear on how conflict resolution affects <code>git blame</code>.</p>  <p>Let's say I have a file in master:</p>  <pre><code>a(); b(); c(); </code></pre>  <p>I modify it in master:</p>  <pre><code>a(); d(); c(); </code></pre>  <p>but so does a co-worker, and they modify it differently, in a separate branch which they then merge in to master:</p>  <pre><code>a(); e(); c(); </code></pre>  <p>Can resolving that conflict affect the blame?  In other words, if my co-worker resolves the conflict by going with my version:</p>  <pre><code>a(); d(); c(); </code></pre>  <p>and I <code>git blame</code> the <code>d();</code> line, who will be blamed: me or my co-worker?</p>  <p>Similarly, let's say git got confused and thought both the first and second lines were conflicted:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; a(); d(); ==== a(); e(); &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>  <p>If my co-worker resolves the conflict with their version:</p>  <pre><code>a(); e(); c(); </code></pre>  <p>and I <code>git blame</code> the <code>a();</code> line, will I (the line's original author) get the blame, or will my co-worker (who "touched" it last, even though they didn't change it) get the blame?</p>
