<p>I have a Developer Check in 240 files into a Changeset #300, in our VSO repo.</p>  <p>I have scripts to pull out files in a changeset to then deploy to different environments. so I have all the files from Changeset 300, and copied them to the server just to find out they were wrong.</p>  <p>FYI: part of that script is:</p>  <pre><code>foreach($i in $ChangesetIDS){&amp; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2012 Power Tools\tfpt.exe" "getcs" "/changeset:$i"} </code></pre>  <p>I need to roll back the changes made in the Changeset!  But it is not like Changeset #299 has the version just before the one stored in #300.</p>  <p>Is there a way to only pull the files associated with Changeset #300  but from whatever the last time that file was checked in (making the assumption #300 is not always the latest version in the repository.)</p>
