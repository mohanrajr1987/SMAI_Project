<p>I have an app that I need to make multiple copies of to make small changes for different clients.  I am saving my progress using Xcode's built in Source Control, but I think what I am wanting to do is create several different working copies.</p>  <p>What is the best way to go about making several completely different apps stemming off of the progress I have on my current app.</p>
