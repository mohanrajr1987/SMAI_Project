<p>I have two branches in Mercurial. One is for debugging on my local computer, because there are some wampserver settings that are only valid on local machines.</p>  <p>The other branch is for publishing and thus contains the server settings that are required on the web server itself. Unfortunately, even a simple <code>index.php</code> is different, because of the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag.</p>  <p>I was wondering how to keep these two branches in sync, without having to merge my local changes to the publish branch every time I want to publish.</p>  <p>Is there a better way to maintain these two branches? Can I for example, commit changes to two branches at the same time?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpZ6K.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpZ6K.jpg" alt="I merge my files every time I have changes to the other branch."></a></p>
