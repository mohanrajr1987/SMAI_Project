<p>I need to create a new solution that has the existing git repo as a remote (not cloned) and pulls from that so that I can start working. Previously I tried blank solution and adding to source control, committing and then adding the remote but I received the error "an upstream branch" (master) "already exists". I'm using Visual Studio Professional 2013. Sorry if this is unclear in any way, I'll be happy to clarify on any details. Thanks in advance</p>
