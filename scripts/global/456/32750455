<p>I have started using git recently. So, this is what I have done - create a git repository in git hub. I had a project so I pushed my project in the github by the following command - </p>  <p>MACHINE 1 (Ubuntu) - PLACE 1</p>  <pre><code>git init git add README.md git commit -m "first commit" git remote add origin https://github.com/joshis1/XPlatformCoreDumpAnalyzer.git git push -u origin master </code></pre>  <p>MACHINE 2(OSX) PLACE 2</p>  <p>Next, I checked out this code in another machine and network - using git clone.</p>  <p>Next, I did on MACHINE 2, PLACE 2</p>  <p>I created a branch GUI_COMPRESSION_OPTION_FIX and I can see this branch in the github - <a href="https://github.com/joshis1/XPlatformCoreDumpAnalyzer/branches" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/joshis1/XPlatformCoreDumpAnalyzer/branches</a> </p>  <hr>  <p>Problem - MACHINE 1 PLACE 1</p>  <p>when I do a </p>  <pre><code>git pull  https://github.com/joshis1/XPlatformCoreDumpAnalyzer.git </code></pre>  <p>Also, when I do gitk, it doesn't show me the branch name - GUI_COMPRESSION_OPTION_FIX.</p>  <p>Looks like, my local git repository is not getting synchronized. My question is how can I force to re-synchronize so that I see the new branch name. I have tried rebase also.</p>
