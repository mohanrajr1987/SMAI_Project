<p>I just installed git and GitHub and the reason is that it's a version control system (that's the only thing I know about it). I am starting a project (a game in Python) and it's going to stretch a long time as I am going to learn Python in deep while working on this. I want to be organized while working on this project and that's why I need a version control system. So, the thing is: 1. I am the only programmer. 2. I don't want to share the code anywhere. 3. I want to work locally only on my system. 4. It's not open source (for the beginning)</p>  <p>So I want to know if GitHub functions according to my needs and how should I create local code repositories and manage my code? </p>  <p>P.S. I am sorry if it looks all messed up, but I couldn't find any better way to put forward.</p>
