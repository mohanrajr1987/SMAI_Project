<p>I'm novice learner of GIT. i'm developing a social networking app. with a friend on Android which is a significantly massive project, so in order to synchronize our development, i decided to use Version Controlling. Now my project is on BitBucket. i'm decided not to waste time on command line and started using "SourceTree" to manage. Now i've certain confusion. i understand the fundamentals of Commits, push , fetch , branching etc. My question is : </p>  <p>Lets say, both me and my friend are working on different activities in our development branches of app. and making commits , but there are some files common to us , like Manifest.xml , build.gradle etc.. so when these branches are merged to "Production/Master" , how will the changes in these "common" files will get accommodated ? what if we both added code to a certain file and arrangement of lines of code matters , then how the merging mechanism will gives us a working project with integrated modules , if i'm wrong with my basic concepts, feel free to correct and suggest me some reference material. thanks in advance</p>
