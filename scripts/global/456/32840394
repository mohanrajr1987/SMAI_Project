<p>So I decided I wanted to change a branch name, and instead of creating a new branch I thought I will use this method, to rewrite the whole branch, but what it actually did was delete all my remote branches.</p>  <p>Any idea how I might get them back.<br> (Please note that I had more branches, but hopefully this will do)</p>  <blockquote>   <p>â†’ git push -f --mirror<br>   Counting objects: 3, done.<br>   Delta compression using up to 4 threads.<br>   Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.<br>   Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 323 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.<br>   Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)<br>   remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:<br>   remote:   ----<br>   To ----<br>    - [deleted]         some_branch<br>    - [deleted]         another_branch<br>    * [new branch]      support_page_changes -> support_page_changes<br>    * [new branch]      origin/master -> origin/master<br>    * [new branch]      origin/another_branch -> origin/another_branch<br>    * [new branch]      origin/some_branch -> origin/some_branch  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Thanks.</p>
