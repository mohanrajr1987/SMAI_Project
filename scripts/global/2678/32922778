<p>Is there any way to detect the following scenario which as far as I know overwrite memory in bad places? Or any other which tries to set an NSDictionary for an NSString or anything like that?</p>  <p><code>int a[6]; a[6] = 8</code>  </p>  <p>Also just to be sure I get a lot of EXC_BAD_ACCESS KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS in my app and from what I've seen these are caused by memory overwrites. Is there any other way to debug this crashes because they don't happen on my devices/simulator but rather for users in certain situations which I can't replicate.</p>
