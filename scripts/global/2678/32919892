<p>I am trying to load an image (5.4 MB) of resolution 4923 x 9405 on an image view. There is a drastic increase in the memory allocation of my app as soon as i load the image. The memory allocation before loading the image was around 17 MB, whereas it reaches 198 MB when i load my image on the image view. I was assuming that my app should consume a memory of 5 MB only while loading the image which proved to be wrong when i analysed the memory allocations of my app. </p>  <p>My Questions</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Why does my iOS app shows such behaviour?</strong></li> <li><strong>Is there any way to identify, what will be the actual memory allocation of the app when any such large images are loaded?</strong></li> </ul>  <p>You can check the attached screenshots for memory allocations before loading the image and after loading the image.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K1GE0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K1GE0.png" alt="Memory allocation before loading the image"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PoJZC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PoJZC.png" alt="Memory allocation after loading the image"></a></p>
