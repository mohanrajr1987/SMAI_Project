<p>I've got a custom <code>UIView</code> of which several instances are created inside a loop:</p>  <pre><code>let models = CDMyModel.MR_findAllSortedBy("position", ascending: true) as! [CDMyModel]  for view in myViews {     view.removeFromSuperview() }  self.myViews.removeAll(keepCapacity: true)  for model in models {     let myView = MYFaqView(width: CGRectGetWidth(self.view.frame))     myView.titleLabel.text = model.title     myView.content.text = model.content     myView.titleLabel.sizeToFit()     self.scrollView.addSubview(myView)     self.myViews.append(myView) } </code></pre>  <p>I do sometimes see crashes in Crashlytics in the line with <code>myView.content.text = model.content</code>:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U5I3L.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U5I3L.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>According to the crash I assume it has something to do with memory, but I really don't know how the myView could have been released at that point.</p>  <p>All this happens in <code>viewWillAppear:</code>. Could the removing before has to do something with this? But I assume everything happens on the main thread, so this shouldn't be a problem as well - I'm really stuck here.</p>  <p>The crash happens on iOS 9.</p>
