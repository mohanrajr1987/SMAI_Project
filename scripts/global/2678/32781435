<p>I've implemented a Java QuadTree which runs perfectly if used inside a PC Java program, but makes Dalvik VM run out of memory when used on Android.</p>  <p>How do I best put the QuadTree or parts of the QuadTree into a file so the memory won't run out?</p>  <p>The QuadTree data is rather static - is there a way to build it on the PC and then use it inside the app?</p>  <p>The structure is as follows:</p>  <p>A class <code>Boundary</code> with two sets of x and y coordinates,</p>  <p>a class <code>POI</code> with a String and two boolean variables,</p>  <p>a class <code>QTData</code> with x and y coordinates and an instance of <code>POI</code></p>  <p>and a class <code>QTNode</code> with an instance of <code>Boundary</code>, an array of <code>QTData</code> objects and possible references to four other instances of the same class.</p>  <p>I need the app to perform searches on the QuadTree, evaluating instances of <code>QTData</code> within a given coordinate range - the <code>POI</code> object associated with a certain <code>QTData</code> object won't be needed in memory if outside that range.</p>  <p>I've got quite some experience with Java, but I've never worked with such huge amounts of data (about 500k nodes) before and I don't know much about serialization or other techniques - as I said, the problem is: how do I, at all times, keep the entire data except the one I need for a certain search, out of the memory?</p>
