<p>I have a 2D array <code>char ** stringArr</code> and at the beginning of the program it is storing strings the user is inputting separated by a space. It's defaulted to store only 2 strings (2 rows). I've initialized it like this:</p>  <pre><code>char ** strArray = (char**)malloc(rows * sizeof(char*));    //initialize 2 rows; rows == 2 for (i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++)                     //initialize 10 columms per row; cols == 10     strArray[i] = (char*)malloc(cols * sizeof(char)); </code></pre>  <p>But if a third string is entered, I want to dynamically allocate a 3rd row. I tried using <code>realloc</code> like this:</p>  <pre><code>strArray = (char**)realloc(strArray, (rows + 1)*sizeof(char*)); </code></pre>  <p>but it keeps crashing when I try to store a char in that new row. I should mention that when storing user input with only 2 strings or less, it works fine. So what am I doing wrong?</p>
