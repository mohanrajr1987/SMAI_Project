<p>I'm reading about virtual memory and my conclusions are following:</p>  <pre><code>malloc(size); </code></pre>  <ol> <li>malloc does not guarantee returning physically contiguous memory. It guarantees returning virtually contiguous memory. Especially it is true when size > 4KB because 4KB is a size of page. ( On Linux systems).</li> </ol>  <p>Am I right or am I wrong? Please explain. Thanks in advance.</p>
