<p>I have come across what I consider strangeness in my C++ code and am curious as to the cause.  I have overloaded new for class Object and print the returned value to the console. I also print the value of this in the constructor for Object.  These values do not match (they differ by one word).  Is this expected?</p>  <pre><code>    void* Object::operator new(size_t size)     {         void* startAddress = ...         std::cout &lt;&lt; "object starts at absolute address " &lt;&lt; (int)startAddress &lt;&lt; "\n";         return startAddress;     }      Object(TypeId type)     {         _type = type;         std::cout &lt;&lt; "this is address " &lt;&lt; (int)this &lt;&lt; "\n";      } </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>object starts at absolute address 5164888 this is address 5164896 </code></pre>
