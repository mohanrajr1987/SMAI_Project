<p>My application uses far too much memory, and uses a lot of images on one of the activities. I went to my main menu which only has 2 image buttons and a background image and removed all of the images from it to see what kind of memory it used... It still seems pretty high for nothing on the page. </p>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/6pfNlxf" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/6pfNlxf</a></p>  <p>Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Or are these normal numbers? In the activity that uses a lot of images, the allocated memory is much higher around 250MB, and crashes if I don't use my tiny scaled down images. </p>
