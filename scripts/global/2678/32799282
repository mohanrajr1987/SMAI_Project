<p>I need to convert an ordinal <code>int</code> value to an enum value in Java. Which is simple:</p>  <pre><code>MyEnumType value = MyEnumType.values()[ordinal]; </code></pre>  <p>The <code>values()</code> method is implicit, and I cannot locate the source code for it, hence the question.</p>  <p>Does the <code>MyEnumType.values()</code> allocate a new array or not? And if it does, should I cache the array when first called? Suppose that the conversion will be called quite often.</p>
