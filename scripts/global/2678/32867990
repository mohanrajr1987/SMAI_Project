<p>I want to display large image set, all images are static resources.</p>  <p>In the main module I'm loading all images in an array with require statement.</p>  <pre><code> var imgList = [{     img: require('image!first') }, {     img: require('image!second') }];   var ImageView = React.createClass({   getInitialState : function(){     return {         currentImg : 0     } },  render: function () {     return (        var index = this.state.currentImg;        return(&lt;Image source={imgList[index].img} style={{flex : 1}} /&gt;);       ); }}); </code></pre>  <p>This approach works and the image are correctly displayed. </p>  <p>As soon as the object received from require is set to image source, the image is loaded into memory of the app. If this.state.currentImg changes, the new image will be loaded and shown. But memory won't be released.</p>  <p>React understands when it is necessary to load the image into memory, but whether it is possible to specify somehow, that the image isn't necessary any more?</p>
