<p>I would like to know how important could be the impact between using a 15.5k library just for doing very simple validations, and, using my own 1k super-simple validation class, in the time when I'll have more than 10k users on my system (Node + Mongo running on a super pentium 8 core 32gb ram).  Is it worst to care about this 14.5k of code? </p>  <p>I cant find any clue in my so bleak but always wondering mind.</p>  <p>I'll apretiate very much your opinion.</p>
