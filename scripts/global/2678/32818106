<p>For example, as simplified as possible:</p>  <pre><code>class thing{     public:         char* arr;         thing(); }  thing::thing{     arr = new char[1000]; } </code></pre>  <p>If I create a dynamically allocated instance of <code>thing</code>, then deallocate it with <code>delete</code>, will the memory that was dynamically allocated by the constructor also be deallocated, or do I have to deallocate <code>arr</code> first?</p>
