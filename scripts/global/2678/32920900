<p>My desktop C# app runs on a tablet;</p>  <p>After logging in, the UI is hidden for ever and it sends some Gps info to our Server every 2'.</p>  <p>When I restart my tablet, it still keeps on working because its exe file is scheduled as activity that run every time I start my device.</p>  <p>Everything seemed to work fine but yesterday I experienced on the server that those info are not sent anymore.</p>  <p>After cleaning the APPDATA it worked again.</p>  <p>I didnt check the memory condition at that time, but what can I do programmatically to check it other than checking the process memory</p>  <pre><code>Process proc = Process.GetCurrentProcess();  proc.PrivateMemorySize64; </code></pre>  <p>and including every thing in a try catch, in order to get the error message?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
