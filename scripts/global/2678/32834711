<p>I want to store strings in a 2D array using pointers but I'm confused with how to do it. The examples I've seen use only arrays of ints or use the brackets[] to allocate a fixed size of memory. So I'm trying to initialize my 2D array of strings and this is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>char ** stringArr = (char**)malloc(/*I don't know what goes here*/); for(i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++)     stringArr[i] = (char*)malloc(cols *sizeof(char)); </code></pre>  <p>As you can see the parameter for my first call of malloc, I am stuck as to what to put there if I want an exact x number of rows, where each row stores a string of chars. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
