<p>My company runs hadoop on mesos, and I’m new to mesos.  The current limiting rate of the hadoop application I’m in charge of is the speed of reducer tasks, so I was hoping to play around with mesos and hadoop memory settings to speed up the reducer.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, I don’t understand the relationship between hadoop memory settings and mesos memory configuration, and I suspect that mesos may be overriding some of my hadoop memory settings.  </p>  <p>Is changing the value of mapreduce.reduce.java.opts or  mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb (in /etc/hadoop/conf/mapred-site.xml) affected by mesos?  Does mesos limit the amount of memory that I can allocate to the reducer? </p>  <p>If so, where are the config files in mesos so I can change those settings?  </p>  <h2>Thanks!</h2>  <p>9/30/2015 Update:</p>  <p>The file at <a href="https://github.com/mesos/hadoop/blob/master/configuration.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mesos/hadoop/blob/master/configuration.md</a> lists parameters that you can put in your mapred-site.xml file.  </p>  <p>I'm still not sure how those parameters affect the memory-associated hadop configuration parameters in mapred-site.xml.</p>
