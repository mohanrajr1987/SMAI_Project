<p>I have read in the book:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A dynamic memory allocator maintains an area of a process's virtual   memory known as the heap.  Details vary from system to system, but   without loss of generality, we will assume that the <strong>heap is an area of   demand-zero memory</strong> that begins immediately after the uninitialized   bss area and grows upward (toward higher addresses).</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, I am confused why memory from heap isn't initialized with zero. To be more precise I mean a chunk of memory returned by malloc.</p>
