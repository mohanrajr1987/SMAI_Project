<p>My boss wants a PHP countdown from a particular date with jquery.</p>  <p>To explain, lets say the end date is 10/15/15. He wants there to a counter that starts with data from a PHP server and then counts down with jquery. The data needs to start with PHP so users don't manipulate their time settings on their computer. The format needs to be in: days, hours, minutes, seconds. Once the counter is equal to zero, a value needs to be sent to the server to communicate the contest has been ended.</p>
