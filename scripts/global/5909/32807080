<p>Could someone please clarify the correct usage for System.Threading.Timer please.</p>  <p>I have a Server Client acknowledgement response model. What I am aiming to do is resend logged messages from the server, if no acknowledgment is received in after a set period of time.</p>  <p>So when the first message is sent I store a Timer;</p>  <pre><code>AutoResetEvent autoEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false); TestsTimeout timeout = new TestsTimeout(firstTest, _socket);  TimerCallback resendCallback = timeout.ResendMessage; Timer timeoutTimer = new Timer(resendCallback, autoEvent, timeoutPeriod, timeoutPeriod); </code></pre>  <p>Then when a acknowledgement to a message is received I simply want to reset the time back and send the next message out. </p>  <pre><code>timeout.Change(0, timeoutPeriod); </code></pre>  <p>Now, I followed the MSDN example for this, however, 0 seems to invoke the callback straight away? is this correct? what is the corect way of doing this please?</p>
