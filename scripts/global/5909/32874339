<p>The version of Java is 8u60.</p>  <p>I want to write a void method which could pause the program for 1 seconds but there are always exceptions.</p>  <pre><code>public void OnePause(){     Timer timerOne = new Timer();     timerOne.schedule(timerOneTask(), (long)1000);}  private TimerTask timerOneTask() {         return null;         } } </code></pre>  <p>I do not want to use Thread.Sleep(); because it pauses the sum of all time when called multiple times instead of pause separately. Thanks a lot.</p>
