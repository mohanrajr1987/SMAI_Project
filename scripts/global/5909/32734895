<p>Is it possible to set a hardware timer peripheral up on the Raspberry Pi and get an interrupt at a certain time (while running under Linux)? Is there a library/example?</p>  <p>I know you can <a href="http://wiringpi.com/reference/priority-interrupts-and-threads/" rel="nofollow">get an irq when a pin changes</a> via wiringPi (when running with admin privileges), so if there's a free timer peripheral it seems possible.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=88334&amp;p=621876" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on the Pi forums implies that there is a free STC register, and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=9882" rel="nofollow">this one</a> gives some info but is tagged 'BareMetal', which I assume means Linux isn't involved?</p>  <p>Background: I know this is not what Linux is good at at all, however I'm interested in adding a hardware timer capability to the <a href="http://www.espruino.com/" rel="nofollow">Espruino</a> JS interpreter. It's originally meant for microcontrollers and contains some code that expects to be run via a timer IRQ (eg. for software PWM, timed pulses, and other bits and bobs) - that part of it would be effectively useless if running in a thread.</p>
