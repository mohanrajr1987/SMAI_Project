<p>I found a lot of questions about how to write a unit test that tests whether something happens before a timeout, using something like</p>  <pre><code>- (void)waitForExpectationsWithTimeout:(NSTimeInterval)timeout handler:(nullable XCWaitCompletionHandler)handler; </code></pre>  <p>but are there any ways to test for "Make sure X does not get called within Y seconds" ?</p>  <p>Our current approach was something like:</p>  <pre><code>[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate:&lt;short before timeout&gt;] </code></pre>  <p>and afterwards check that the block never got called.</p>  <p>Unfortunately since XCode 7 the outcome of these tests has become very non-deterministic... is there a better way to test this?</p>
