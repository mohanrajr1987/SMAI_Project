<p>I am using libgdx and i have several game objects with different methods i want the methods in my timer to happen one after another but in libgdx they happen all at once i dont know how to fix it</p>  <pre><code>    timer.scheduleTask( task = new Task(){ public void run(){     rando =rn.nextInt(8);     Gdx.app.log("the num is", Integer.toString(rando));     if(rando == 0){         bush.rustle();         bush2.rustle2();         bush3.dontrustle3();         bush4.dontrustle4();         enemy.shoot();         enemy2.shoot();         enemy3.godown();         enemy4.godown();       }      if(rando == 1){         bush.dontrustle();         bush2.rustle2();         bush3.rustle3();         bush4.dontrustle4();         enemy.godown();         enemy2.shoot();         enemy3.shoot();         enemy4.godown();      }     if(rando == 2){         bush.rustle();         bush2.dontrustle2();         bush3.rustle3();         bush4.rustle4();         enemy2.godown();         enemy.shoot();         enemy4.shoot();         enemy3.shoot();       }      if(rando == 3){         bush.rustle();         bush2.rustle2();         bush3.rustle3();         bush4.rustle4();         enemy.shoot();         enemy2.goup();         enemy4.goup();         enemy3.shoot();      }      if(rando == 4){         bush.rustle();         bush2.rustle2();         bush3.rustle3();         bush4.rustle4();         enemy2.godown();         enemy.godown();         enemy4.shoot();         enemy3.shoot();       } </code></pre>  <p>how it works is that everytime a number is called a set of methods run but they run all at once i want them to run one after the other</p>
