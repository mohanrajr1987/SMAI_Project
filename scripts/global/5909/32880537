<p>I have written a java script code at _layout.cshtml page to define a timer.</p>  <pre><code>setTimeout("location.href='@Url.Action("Login", "Account", new { checkSessionID = 1 }) '", 7200000); </code></pre>  <p>During post back timer get reset automatically that's fine. But I need to reset this timer during Jquery Ajax Call.</p>  <p>Can anyone suggest how to do this globally at one place for all ajax calls.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
