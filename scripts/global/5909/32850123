<p>I want to implement a real-time system in which events are triggered at known times.  I could use System.Timers.Timer, and at the end of each event calculate when the next event happens and go into a sleep mode until it occurs some milliseconds later.</p>  <p>The question is, is this the only option I have available or is there a way for events to Trigger after a known time, without starting hundreds of Timers?</p>  <p>The reason for the question is, while I expect each event to execute very quickly, it's possible that an event's start + duration will exceed the next event's start, and I don't want that.  Therefore, whatever you suggest has to be independent of the code that executes.</p>
