<p>I have two countdowntimers in my activity. One set to countdown from 10 secondes the other from 5 seconds. When I click the countdownbutton, timer 1 starts. When this timer finishes, I want timer2 to start, the problem is that timer2 never gets excuted. </p>  <p>I have 2 local var which track what timer is executing, when I debug, I see that the right value for these vars is set, but still the secondtimer is not executing.</p>  <p>Here is my CountdownTimer-class:</p>  <pre><code> public class MyCountDownTimer extends CountDownTimer {     public MyCountDownTimer(long startTime, long interval) {         super(startTime, interval);     }      @Override     public void onFinish() {         if (ctHasStarted) {             ctHasStarted = false;             timerValue.setText("00:00:000");              countDownTimer2.start();             ct2HasStarted = true;         }         if (ct2HasStarted) {             ct2HasStarted = false;             timerValue2.setText("00:00:000");              countDownTimer.start();             ctHasStarted = true;         }     }      @Override     public void onTick(long millisUntilFinished) {          int secs = (int) (millisUntilFinished / 1000);         int mins = secs / 60;         secs = secs % 60;         int milliseconds = (int) (millisUntilFinished % 1000);          if (ctHasStarted)             timerValue.setText(String.format("%02d",mins) + ":"                 + String.format("%02d", secs) + ":"                 + String.format("%03d", milliseconds));         if (ct2HasStarted)             timerValue2.setText(String.format("%02d",mins) + ":"                 + String.format("%02d", secs) + ":"                 + String.format("%03d", milliseconds));      } } </code></pre>  <p>ctHasStarted and ct2HasStarted are boolean values to keep track of what timer is running. As said when I debug, the lines countDownTimer.start() and countDownTimer2.start() both are reached. But the textfield for timer2 never gets updated. even the line timerValue2.setText("00:"00:00") doesn't work.</p>  <p>I initialize both timers in my onCreate of the activity like:</p>  <pre><code>countDownTimer = new MyCountDownTimer(ctStartTime, interval); countDownTimer2 = new MyCountDownTimer(ct2StartTime, interval); </code></pre>  <p>An other strange thing I noticed is that when I change line <strong>if (ct2HasStarted)</strong> in the onTick-event to <strong>else</strong> the timerValue2.setText-is showing a countdown. But after the second times is finished, the first one is not executed despite the call for start of the first time in the onFinish event.</p>  <p>I think I miss something, but I don't know what I miss. Any suggestions?</p>
