<p>I'm aware that return values from <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> are unique within a given DOM at least for timers running at that moment, but once one of these timers finishes or is cancelled is the same number ever reused? What about for example <code>setTimeout</code> outputting a number which <code>setInterval</code> has already given, or similar?</p>  <p>My instinct is that I can rely on them never being reused. Otherwise I'd feel the need to clear variables pointing to a timer identifier as soon as the timer ends or I cancel it, lest some other code attempt to cancel it later when it is pointing to an unrelated timer (which has by chance been assigned the same identifier).</p>  <p>Assuming they are not supposed to be reused, are there any browsers which misbehave?</p>
