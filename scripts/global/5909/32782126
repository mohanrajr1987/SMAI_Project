<p>I have the following code, which is supposed to load the form, change the text every second and then run a shutdown command at the end. The cancel button would cancel the shutdown (or just close the form, preventing the shutdown command from running).</p>  <pre><code>Public Class FRM_SHUTDOWN  Private Sub FRM_SHUTDOWN_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Shutting Down in 6..." End Sub  Private Sub FRM_SHUTDOWN_Shown(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Shutting Down in 6..."     Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000)     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Shutting Down in 5..."     Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000)     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Shutting Down in 4..."     Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000)     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Shutting Down in 3..."     Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000)     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Shutting Down in 2..."     Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000)     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Shutting Down in 1..."     Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000)     LBL_TIMER.Text = "Windows is Shutting Down"     Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000)     'System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("shutdown", "-s -t 0")     MessageBox.Show("Shutdown instant would happen here") End Sub  Private Sub BTN_CANCEL_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles BTN_CANCEL.Click     'System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("shutdown", "-a")     MessageBox.Show("Cancel shutdown command")     Me.Close() End Sub </code></pre>  <p>End Class</p>  <p>The problem I'm having is that the form loads and appears like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tnfbJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tnfbJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So it doesn't actually show the 'stop' button or the countdown timer!</p>  <p>Can anyone explain why?</p>
