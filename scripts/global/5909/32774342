<p>I am trying to figure out what is the best possible solution to create a website to function as a weekly programmable timer; after searching many hours I keep coming up empty handed. </p>  <p>I tried to start development on a web page. This is where I wound up: <a href="http://www.gstrip.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.gstrip.tk</a></p>  <p>I have a complete lack of knowledge on how to progress from this point. </p>  <ul> <li>How do I store the timers?</li> <li>How do I make the server search for timers. </li> <li>Then how do I execute a function such as a simple html request when the stored time for that day matches the current time?</li> </ul>  <p>This has been a huge stumbling block for me I assumed there would be an open source web based weekly programmable timer somewhere that I could modify but it appears nearly to be not available.</p>  <p>If it is already posted could you provide a link or something anything as I have searched fairly regularly the last couple of weeks with no results using different terms both on google and on stack. Maybe the syntax of my search is wrong somehow and this may be the reason for the lack of results IDK but I could sure use someone who is understanding and willing to level with me on this issue.</p>
