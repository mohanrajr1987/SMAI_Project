<p>I have a label which moves from the right to the left under a TabControl. I switch into the tabs every 10 seconds with a timer. The problem is, that the label stops moving while the tab is changing. And this is really annoying. How to fix that? This is the code, where i move the label:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Timer2_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer2.Tick     LabelNews.Left = LabelNews.Left - 5     If LabelNews.Left &lt;= 0 Then         LabelNews.Left = 1867     End If     Timer2.Stop()     Timer2.Start() End Sub </code></pre>
