<p>I've looked at several posts pertaining to the same problem I'm having but I can't figure out how to fix mine. They say to add a public class but I'm just met with more errors. I get an error at line 1 which is a comment that is fine before I add the try-catch. (Code skips to where try catch is)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;%            String curr1 = request.getParameter("lstCurrency1");     String curr2 = request.getParameter("lstCurrency2");     String errorMessage = null;      try {     Double currIn = Double.parseDouble(request.getParameter("txtCurrency1"));                 Double convert = fxDataModel.getFxRate(curr1,curr2)*currIn;     }     catch (NumberFormatException ex){          errorMessage = "Please insert a valid number!";     }     String[] currencies = fxDataModel.getFxCurrencies();  %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This code is above my html page which draws on currIn and convert to fill textboxes. Everything here works fine until I add the try-catch. I have read that I might need to add a public class but everytime I try it gives me more errors and "request" is no longer recognized. Could anyone help me figure out why it's saying Illegal start of type?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
