<p>In <code>GraphicsFileNotFoundException.java</code> all I have is an import of <code>FileNotFoundException</code> and the class <code>GraphicsFileNotFoundException</code> which extends <code>FileNotFoundException</code>. </p>  <p>In my main java file, I'm trying to read in a graphics file with the method <code>getGraphicsFile</code> which throws <code>GraphicsFileNotFoundException</code>. </p>  <p>My brain is pooped after a good 40 minutes trying to find out how to catch this exception. I've tried using a try-catch block and catching <code>GraphicsFileNotFoundException</code> but I still get the error</p>  <pre><code>unreported exception GraphicsFileNotFoundException ; must be caught    or declared to be thrown.    public void getGraphicsFile(String fileName) throws GraphicsFileNotFoundException {     String graphics = "";     Scanner getGraphics = null;     try {        getGraphics = new Scanner(new File(fileName));     }      catch (GraphicsFileNotFoundException e){       System.out.println("Error! File can't be found :/");     } </code></pre>
