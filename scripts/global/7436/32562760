<p>I am trying to display a downloaded file in a <code>UIWebView</code>. This works well for many file types, including <code>pptx</code> files. </p>  <pre><code>let request = NSURLRequest(URL: NSURL(fileURLWithPath: path)) webView.loadRequest(request) </code></pre>  <p>Some PowerPoint files, however, crash the web view. In my project, it is not feasible to parse the file type and dynamically modify the loading process. </p>  <p>Thus, I would simply like to catch the crash, abort the loading of the request and inform the user that it is not possible to display this file.</p>  <p>How can this be accomplished with Swift error handling? I would prefer not to drop back to some Objective-C hack to emulate the try-catch-finally pattern in Swift.</p>
