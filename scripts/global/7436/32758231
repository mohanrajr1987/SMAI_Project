<p>I used this method very much in Swift 1.2: <code>NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest(:_:_:_)</code> but this is apparently deprecated in iOS9. It still works however but now it uses the new Swift 2.0 Error Handling and I don't know how I will get the error message if it fails, ex. if time runs out.</p>  <p>I know I have to put it into a do-catch and then say try before the metho but I dont know how to catch the error message.</p>  <pre><code>do {     let data = try NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest(request, returningResponse: nil)     return data  } catch _ {     return nil } </code></pre>  <p>Before I used NSError and then its description property, but now I have no clue.</p>
