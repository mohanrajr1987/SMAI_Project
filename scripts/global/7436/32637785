<p>I'm trying to have offline computers recorded in a text file so that I can run them again at a later time. Doesn't seem that it is being recorded or caught in catch. </p>  <pre><code>function Get-ComputerNameChange {      [CmdletBinding()]     Param(     [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,ValueFromPipeline=$True,ValueFromPipelinebyPropertyName=$True)]     [string[]]$computername,     [string]$logfile = 'C:\PowerShell\offline.txt'     )         PROCESS {          Foreach($computer in $computername) {         $continue = $true         try { Test-Connection -computername $computer -Quiet -Count 1 -ErrorAction stop         } catch [System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingException]         {             $continue = $false              $computer | Out-File $logfile         }         }          if($continue){         Get-EventLog -LogName System -ComputerName $computer | Where-Object {$_.EventID -eq 6011} |          select machinename, Time, EventID, Message }}} </code></pre>
