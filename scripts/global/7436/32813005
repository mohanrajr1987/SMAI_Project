<p>I hate asking duplicate questions, but I have been researching and working on this program all day without much luck. It's supposed to take a temperature of water in Cel. or Far., and an altitude in Feet or Meters, and  tell you whether at the given altitude, the water is either in liquid, gas, or solid form (not factoring in atmospheric pressure, I am just trying to get a rough estimate based on the altitude). The rules of thumb is that water will boil at ~1 degree lower than 100 degrees C. for every 300 meters (or 1000 feet) above sea-level.</p>  <p>I managed to find a couple ways to make it return a roughly correct number. The next step is adding error checking to the program. I tried a 'try' clause, but it does not catch the errors, and for the life of me I cannot figure out why.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>I tried this a different way, and it works, catching the errors, except for one odd problem. When entering the input in both functions inpALT() and inpTEMP, it asks me to enter the input twice, and than returns the correct values... :</p>  <pre><code>def inpALT():     alt = str(input("Enter altitude above altlevel, format 100M/F :"))     if re.match(r'[0-9]*[mMfF]$', alt):         return alt     else:         raise ValueError("Invalid Format")       def inpTEMP():     temp = str(input("Tempurature in format 70C/F :"))     if re.match(r'[0-9]*[cCfF]$', temp):     return temp     else:         raise ValueError("Invalid Format")   while True:     try:         inpALT()         break     except ValueError:("Invalid Format")        while True:     try:         inpTEMP()         break     except ValueError:("Invalid Format")  temp = inpTEMP() alt = inpALT()  ---- snip ---- </code></pre>  <p>However, it only does so after I have to enter the data <em>twice</em>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Enter altitude above altlevel, format 100M/F :100F </p>      <p>Enter Temperature in format 70C/F :100F</p>      <p>Enter Tempurature in format 70C/F :100F</p>      <p>Enter altitude above altlevel, format 100M/F :100F</p> </blockquote>  <p>Why does it do that...?</p>
