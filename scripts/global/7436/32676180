<p>I have a page in which a button click invokes the following JavaScript code. The page uses jquery and jquery-ui for animation. This code uses the <code>toggle</code> method of jquery-ui and not a similar method of jquery.</p>  <p>I am deliberately passing an incorrect value for the first parameter of <code>animation effect</code> to check if the catch block works as expected.</p>  <p>The first time the button is clicked and this code is invoked, an exception is thrown and catch block is reached. But when I invoke the same code a second time by clicking the button again, then the catch block is never reached, instead control goes directly to the first line after catch block even though the first parameter is still invalid.</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong> : Why is an invalid animation effect parameter not throwing an exception when called a second time, but only throwing it the first time its called?</p>  <pre><code>var emt = $("#cDiv");  try {     emt.hide();     emt.toggle("xyz", {         easing: "swing"     }, 1000, function() {         animationCompleted = true;         startPolling();     }); } catch (e) {     console.log(e.message); } </code></pre>  <p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong></p>  <p>I have a added a code sample on jsfiddle to demonstrate my problem. The sample is at this url: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/sun21170/rm580npe/4/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/sun21170/rm580npe/4/</a></p>  <p>In this code sample, if a valid animation effect is selected from the drop-down then the <code>Custom Div</code> animates as expected, but if <code>xyz</code> is selected as the animation effect, then we get an error which can be seen in the errors div. However, the error does not show up repeatedly on clicking <code>Animate Custom Div</code> button while <code>xyz</code> is the selected animation effect.</p>
