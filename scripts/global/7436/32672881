<p>So I recently started with transactions and error handling in SQL Server in college and I've run into this issue which my teachers haven't been able to explain. When I try and execute this block:</p>  <pre><code>Begin Transaction TRA   Begin Try     Alter Table history     Add Primary Key (employee_id,date_beg)   End Try   Begin catch     If @@trancount&gt;0     Select ERROR_NUMBER() Error, ERROR_MESSAGE() Mensaje   End Catch Commit </code></pre>  <p>I get the following error messages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Msg 8111, Level 16, State 1, Line 2<br>   Cannot define PRIMARY KEY constraint on nullable column in table 'history'.</p>      <p>Msg 1750, Level 16, State 0, Line 2<br>   Could not create constraint. See previous errors.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So it seems the code doesn't catch the error as it's supposed to.</p>  <p>Would really appreciate it if you could help me!</p>
