<p>Why does line 2 compile while line 3 does not? spit() throws a HurtException that has already been caught on line 1, so any checked exception that comes afterwards should be unreachable. If I delete line 2, line 3 will remain reachable. Exceptions are not exempt from compile-time checking. Thanks in advance for clarifying this for me.</p>  <pre><code>public class Ape {     public void run() {         try {             spit();         } catch (HurtException e) { //line 1             System.out.println("f");         } catch (LimpException ex) { //line 2: Unreachable, HurtException already caught             System.out.println("e");         } catch (Exception ee) {     //line 3: Compiles, why?             System.out.println("r");         }     }      public static void main(String[] args) {         new Ape().run();     }      public void spit() throws HurtException {         throw new HurtException();     }      class LimpException extends Exception {     }      class HurtException extends LimpException {     } } </code></pre>
