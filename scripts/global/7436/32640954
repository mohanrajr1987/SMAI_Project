<p>Is there a way when catching an exception to determine if it were constructed with a non-default message.</p>  <pre><code>        try         {             throw new Exception(message);      // case 1             //throw new Exception();           // case 2         }          catch(Exception exp)         {             /* what do I put here such that if the case 2 exception were                caught it would output exp.ToString() instead of exp.Message? */              textBox1.Text = exp.Message;  // case 1 handeling          } </code></pre>  <p>Just to clarify when Exception(message) is thrown I want it to ouptut exp.Message and when Exception() is thrown I want to output exp.ToString().  I would prefer to accomplish this without adding a custom exception.  Thanks.</p>
