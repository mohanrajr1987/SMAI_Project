<p>I was reading about <code>try-with-resource</code> statement in Java which can be used to specify any number of resources. </p>  <pre><code>try (Resource1 res1 = initialize_code; Resource1 res2 = initialize_code; ...)  {     statement; } </code></pre>  <p>Now when the try block exits (normally or abnormally throwing an exception) the <code>close</code> methods of all resource objects are invoked. But some <code>close</code> methods can throw exceptions. What will happen in that scenario if <code>close</code> itself throws exception?</p>
