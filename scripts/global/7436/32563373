<p>I have a function </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php public function setStatusToReadyToShip(array $order_item_ids, $delivery_type, $shipping_provider = '', $tracking_number = '') {   //code } </code></pre>  <p>Now I want the caller to call this method by providing $order_item_ids in array format. </p>  <p>One way i could do is to check <code>is_array($order_item_ids)</code> and send the error to the caller. But i am to utilize Type Hinting. How would i send the user the error response when using type hinting. As currently it crashes the application and says</p>  <pre><code>exception 'ErrorException' with message 'Argument 1 passed to Class::SetStatusToReadyToShip() must be of the type array, integer given </code></pre>  <p>I am not familiar with the try catch stuff that much. I tried placing try-catch inside this function so that it does not crash the application but the same output received.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
