<p>I am very new to Java and I am trying to make a lottery game and I am stuck on the first step. The first step is that the user enters their input and if it's a number and between 1 - 100 then I want the user to exit out of the while loop but If the user enters a number bigger than 100 or smaller than one or not a number, then it should go back and ask the user to input a number again. I did something similar to this with python but in java it doesn't wait for my next input!!</p>  <p>here is my code: </p>  <pre><code>public class Lottery {      /** * @param args the command line arguments */     public static void main(String[] args) {          System.out.println("\t \tWelcome to the Lottery!");         boolean boolCheck = true;            System.out.println("Please enter in a number between 1 and 100: ");          InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);         BufferedReader buffer = new BufferedReader(isr);         String input="";         while (true)  {                try {                     input = buffer.readLine();                 buffer.close();                 input.trim();                  int intInput = Integer.parseInt(input);                  if (intInput &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; intInput &lt;= 100)  {                     break;                 }               }             catch (IOException e)  {                 System.out.println("An input eror has occured");              }             catch (NumberFormatException e)  {                 System.out.println("Please enter in a number");             }          }       } </code></pre>  <p>Basically if there is an error, I want it to go back to the input instead of infinite looping.</p>
