<p>So I've been set the task to load a file for an encryption program I'm working on, but I'm getting an error stating that the console has came across an <code>Unexpected unindent</code>, yet I have no idea where it is! I've assumed it is a glitch, tried rewriting the code, yet still I've been getting the same error! I'm an amateur coder, can anyone please help me out? </p>  <p>This is part of the code I'm having trouble with:</p>  <pre><code>def loadFile():     try:         aFile = input('Plese enter a filename: \n')         myFile = open(aFile, 'r+')         global myFile         try:             print('Gathering file information...')             time.sleep(1)             print('The string you have chosen to encrypt is:')             print(myFile.read())         finally:             myFile.close()     except IOError:         print('The file does not exist \n')         loadFile() </code></pre>
