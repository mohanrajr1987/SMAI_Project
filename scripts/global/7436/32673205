<p>Might anyone know why this try catch block loop is not working. I want the code to go to the catch block whenever the user inputs a string instead of a number but it doesn't seem to want to.</p>  <pre><code>x = 1; while x == 1     try         degree = input('Please enter the degree of the polynomial of interest: ');         if degree &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; degree &lt;= 4             x = 0;         else             disp('Please Enter a degree from 1 to 4')         end     catch         exit = input('do you wish to exit (Y/N)','s');         if strcmp(exit,'Y')             break         else             disp('Please enter an integer this time')         end     end end </code></pre>
