<p>I am very knew to Python, so as expected, I'm encountering problems often when scripting and am usually not sure how to fix them.</p>  <p>I'm making a small game where you try and guess a number which the program has randomly chosen. I've gotten pretty far, but I noticed the program simply displayed an error message when I input nothing. I would like the program to display the text "Enter a number." in this situation, and then prompt the "Your guess: " input again, but after a lot of research, I'm really not sure how to successfully implement that feature into my code. My issue, specifically, is the "try and except" section - I don't really know how to write them properly, but I saw another post on here suggesting to use them. </p>  <pre><code>import random  def question():     print("Guess a number between 1 and 100.")     randomNumber = random.randint(1, 100)     found = False      while not found:         myNumber = int(input("Your guess: "), 10)         try:             myNumber = int(input("Your guess: "), 10)         except ValueError:             print("Enter a number.")          if myNumber == randomNumber:             print("Correct!")             found = True         elif myNumber &gt; randomNumber:             print("Wrong, guess lower!")         else:             print("Wrong, guess higher!")  question() </code></pre>  <p>You should be able to see my intentions in the code I've written, thanks.</p>
