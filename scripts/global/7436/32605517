<p>I am working on a simple class project for school to experiment with inheritance and other essentials in c# but I am having trouble with a certain part. I believe I need a try catch within an unconditional while loop to be certain the user enters the data in the correct form but I also need to be able to break out of the loop from within the error handling code. I have put a comment beneath the code that is giving me problems.</p>  <pre><code>class Program : students {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         students stu = new students();          Console.Write("Number of students are you recording results for: ");         int studNum = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());         stu.setNoOfStudents(studNum);         Console.WriteLine();          for (int a = 0; a &lt; studNum; a++)         {             Console.Write("{0}. Forename: ", a + 1);             stu.setForname(Console.ReadLine());             Console.Write("{0}. Surname: ", a + 1);             stu.setSurname(Console.ReadLine());             while (0 == 0)             {                 try                 {                     Console.Write("{0}. Age: ", a + 1);                     stu.setstudentAge(int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()));                     Console.Write("{0}. Percentage: ", a + 1);                     stu.setpercentageMark(int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()));                     stu.fillArray();                      break;                     // This is the block that gives me problems; the                     // while loop doesn't break.                 }                  catch (Exception)                 {                     Console.WriteLine("This must be a number.");                 }             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>I'm not getting an error because its within a try/catch but the while(0 == 0) loop is never broken so the for loop cannot iterate the command. Can someone give me a solution to this?</p>
