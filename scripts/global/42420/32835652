<p>Using the Android tools for C++ in VS15, I've been unable to get the debugger working... VS is able to install the app on the test device without an issue, but debugging does not work. </p>  <pre><code>Unable to start debugging. Non-debuggable application installed on the target device. Required file '/data/data/com.AndroidTest/lib/gdbserver' could not be found on the device. Please reinstall the debuggable version. </code></pre>  <p>I've inspected the apk; it does have gdbserver. </p>  <p>The device I'm using is a LG G 7.0 (V400) running Android 5.0.2. The project targets API level 19, but I've also tried targeting API level 21 and still the same issue. </p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
