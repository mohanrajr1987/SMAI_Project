<p>I am a Java web developer; I, essentially, write JSP applications. My most comfortable environment is Linux, but I do Ok on Windows. I know very little about Android app development, and I know nothing about C++.</p>  <p>I have recently been tasked with writing an Android app. The Android app, itself, isn't that daunting, but here is where it gets complicated. The company has a couple of pre-existing widgets written in C++ that they want me to include into the Android app. Currently they are stand-alone Windows applications, but I have the source code.</p>  <p>What I need to know is, can I use the Android NDK to utilize the C++ code in my Android app? Can I use this pre-existing C++ code in my Android app and call the functions like I do classes in java? Can I then compile the whole kit and caboodle into a single Android app with all functionalities of my original code, and the pre-existing widgets?</p>  <p>Like I said, I know nothing about C++, so I have no idea where to even get started. I have done some reading on the Android NDK, but since I have no C++ experience, and <strong>very</strong> little Android experience ( just some tutorials on <a href="http://developer.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.google.com/</a> ), I don't even know which files I should import into the project.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
