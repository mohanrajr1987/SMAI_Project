<p>My Android app, within NDK built .so files, crashes on the ASUS ZenFone 5 device just like the issue in this link <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25240693/android-native-crash-at-system-lib-libhoudini-so-on-asus-phone">(Android) Native crash at /system/lib/libhoudini.so on Asus Phone</a></p>  <p>It seems the libhoudini.so, the ARM to x86 translator, can not work under certain conditions so I tried to directly provide an <code>x86</code> arch .so file within my app.</p>  <p>The APK could run on most x86 devices including the x86 simulators. However, on this device I get an issue:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Couldn't load game from loader dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[DexPathList[[zip file "/data/app/com.myapp-1.apk"],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/data/app-lib/com.myapp-1, /vendor/lib, /system/lib, /system/lib/arm]]]: findLibrary returned null</p> </blockquote>  <p>It seems this Intel Atom based device ignores the <code>lib/x86</code> folder in the APK file.</p>  <p>How can I make this device load the right so file with right arch?</p>
