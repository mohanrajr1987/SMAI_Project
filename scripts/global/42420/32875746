<p>I'm trying to get acquainted with openFrameworks and Android application. I installed both Android SDK and NDK (r10e) and I tried to compile the AndroidGuiExample.  Unfortunately, this is what the terminal returned at the end:</p>  <pre><code>undefined reference to 'std::__throw_out_of_range_fmt(char const*, ...)' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status make[2]: *** [libs/armeabi-v7a/libOFAndroidApp.so] Error 1 make[1]: *** [Debug] Error 2 make: *** [AndroidDebug] Error 2 </code></pre>  <p>I have not sincerely a clear idea of what happened. Anyone could help me in understanding the error and finding a solution? Thanks everyone!</p>
