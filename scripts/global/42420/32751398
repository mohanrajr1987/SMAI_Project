<p>In Android Studio 1.3.2, I have set <code>sdk.dir</code> and <code>ndk.dir</code> set in <code>local.properties</code>, but how can I access them within my gradle build scripts? </p>  <p>What I want to do is call ndk-build manually without having to hard code a path to the ndk-build, which now is in a known location at <code>sdk/ndk-bundle/ndk-build</code>. Are these path variables exposed, or, how can I expose them?</p>
