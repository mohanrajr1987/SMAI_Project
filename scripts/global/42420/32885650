<p>I have an android application with Crashlytics which is working fine. Now I am trying to enable NDK crashreport. I have followed <a href="https://fabric.io/downloads/gradle/ndk" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial to add ndk support in my app but android studio is giving me following error:</p>  <pre><code>Error:(46, 0) Gradle DSL method not found: 'enableNdk()' </code></pre>  <p>I also tried to build from command line but it also gave me following error:</p>  <pre><code>Could not find method enableNdk() for arguments [true] on project </code></pre>
