<p>I want to write a simple "Hello World" GUI (not CLI) app in C++ and run it on my Android device. I tried the Hello-JNI sample from Android NDK package, but it also uses some Java code and I want to do it in pure C++ way, without JNI. Is it even possible or do I <em>have to</em> use some Java wrapper?</p>  <p>It would be nice to do it the old way â€“ without Eclipse, just a C++ code file + makefile.</p>
