<p>I'm trying to compile the PugiXML library with Android NDK; it says on the website that this is possible, but the download doesn't contain an android makefile and I haven't used NDK much before (the docs don't help!)</p>  <p>I'm currently getting the error:</p>  <pre><code>/pugiconfig.o: file not recognized: File format not recognized collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status </code></pre>  <p>I was originally getting an error because NDK couldn't find <code>#include &lt;iterator&gt;</code> and I'm not sure I've correctly resolved this. I tried following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4893403/cant-include-c-headers-like-vector-in-android-ndk">this stackoverflow Q/A</a> and ended up with the error shown above.</p>  <p>My current Android.mk looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)  include $(CLEAR_VARS)  LOCAL_MODULE    := webface LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION := .hpp .cpp LOCAL_SRC_FILES := ../pugiconfig.hpp ../pugixml.hpp ../pugixml.cpp  include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY) </code></pre>  <p>and my current Application.mk looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>APP_ABI := all APP_STL := stlport_shared </code></pre>
