<p>My Android NDK C++ application receives touch events and uses the <code>AMotionEvent_getEventTime()</code> to get the time of a touch event. I need to compare that time to time values which I sample on my own during the app execution. The function <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group___input.html#ga7e13fbf3cff0700b0b620284ebdd3a33" rel="nofollow">docs</a> say it gives its time "in the java.lang.System.nanoTime() time base", so I need to have the equivalent of this call in my C++ code.<br> The best clue I got is <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> but is it really that?</p>
