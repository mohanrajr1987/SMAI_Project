<p>I need Eigen C++ library to build my Android app. So, I google and find a great library here <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/eigen" rel="nofollow">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/eigen</a></p>  <p>But, I don't know how to use this library, how to compile and include them into my project.</p>  <p>I'm using Android Studio with Grade-experimental 2.1.0</p>  <p>Anybody have experience about this? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
