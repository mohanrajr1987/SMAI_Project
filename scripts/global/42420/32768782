<p>My app receives RTP audio over UDP, parse it and play it. The receiving and parsing is done in C with JNI and I have an instance of AudioTrack for playing. Every thing works great until (including) NDK r6b (long time ago). When using the exact same code with later NDK the sound is terrible, you couldn't tell that some is speaking. I must upgrade to latest NDK, please help!</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
