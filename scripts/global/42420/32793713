<p>I am trying to build an Android library project with native code. Per the "Known limitations" section under  <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental" rel="nofollow">http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental</a> hybrid library projects are supported. But I don't seem to see the native so files being generated under the libs folder of the library aar file.</p>  <p>Here is how my project setup looks like</p>  <ol> <li>Followed steps in <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental" rel="nofollow">http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental</a> for ndk support</li> <li>Added a library modules that statically loads the native so file and exposes capabilities via some methods</li> <li>Added another module that uses the native module. Set the module dependencies to include the library project.</li> </ol>  <p>When I run this app I get an UnsatisfiedLinkError, which I expected as I see no native so files being generated in the aar file.</p>  <p>This is how my library build.gradle file looks like</p>  <pre><code>apply plugin: 'com.android.model.library'  model {      android {          compileSdkVersion = 23          buildToolsVersion = "23.0.1"      }      android.ndk {          moduleName = "native"          cppFlags = ['-std=c++11']          stl = "gnustl_shared"      } } </code></pre>  <p>This is how my app module's build.gradle looks like</p>  <pre><code>apply plugin: 'com.android.model.application' model {     android {         compileSdkVersion = 23         buildToolsVersion = "23.0.1"     } } dependencies {     compile project(':mylibrary') } </code></pre>
