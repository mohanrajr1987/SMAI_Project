<p>In Android C++ code, I often see <code>CHECK_INTERFACE</code>, for example:</p>  <pre><code>CHECK_INTERFACE(IDrm, data, reply); </code></pre>  <p>I am not C++ developer, I have a little knowledge of C++ only. I tried to find what <code>CHECK_INTERFACE</code> means, respectively what this method does. (I suppose that it is a method). I cannot find any declaration of it.</p>  <p>Could you explain it to me, please? Thanks a lot.</p>
