<p>There are places both here on StackOverflow and on other forums where people say the output directory for the "final.so" file in an NDK build can be specified thusly:</p>  <pre><code>MY_APP_PATH_FOR_OUTPUT := $(call my-dir) NDK_APP_OUT := $(MY_APP_PATH_FOR_OUTPUT)/../../buildresults/android </code></pre>  <p>But when I do this there is no change in output location of the final product (MyLibrary.so).  It does put intermediate files ("local/armeabi/*") in that directory, but I need the final output to go there.</p>  <p>What's the way one is supposed to accomplish this?</p>  <p>Note: What I'm talking about is the very final build step that ndk-build labels "[armeabi] Install".  I'm building a .so file and want it to go into the directory I specify during that step.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
