<p>I'm working on a project in android studio and need to setup ndk and jni for the same. I tried updating the gradle version being used in my project to version 2.5 using instructions from <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental" rel="nofollow">here</a> but I'm getting this error during gradle build:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error Cause: org.gradle.model.internal.core.NodeBackedModelSet</p> </blockquote>
