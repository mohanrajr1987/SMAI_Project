<p>I have been working on a project which i use C++ libraries in Eclipse with NDK. Since Google announced they will not support Eclipse any more, i have decided to move the project to Android Std. In my new environment i am using Visual Std. 2015 to compile C++ and Android Studio for Java.</p>  <p>In Android Std. i am adding .so files with System.loadLibrary(); </p>  <p>However during run time android returns me this error message:</p>  <pre><code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot load library: soinfo_link_image(linker.cpp:1636): could not load library "C:\Sirius\Main\Android\Quest\MyQuest\obj\local\armeabi\lib_FrameworkExtreme.so" needed by "lib_FrameworkExtreme_Exceptions.so"; caused by load_library(linker.cpp:746): library "C:\Sirius\Main\Android\Quest\MyQuest\obj\local\armeabi\lib_FrameworkExtreme.so" not found </code></pre>  <p>Both "lib_FrameworkExtreme" and "lib_FrameworkExtreme_Exceptions" are C++ libraries. </p>  <p>This is the screenshot for how i add project references in Visual Std.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9owFk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9owFk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As far as i understand .so files are trying to reach wrong path for references projects. </p>  <p>Any idea about how should i add the references?</p>
