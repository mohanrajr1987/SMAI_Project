<p>I've inherited some java code that uses the JBoss Logging implementation explicitly.  I know that this is normally configured as a JBoss Subsytem, and I'm able to observe various log tuning operations just fine when running on the server.  However, I'm not getting any log message output for unit tests.  I've dropped several configuration files on the test classpath to include:</p>  <ul> <li>logging.properties</li> <li>log4j.xml</li> <li>log4j2.xml</li> </ul>  <p>but have not seen any results.  Has anyone been able to configure the JBoss Logging system such that they're visible outside of the container in unit tests?  Is this even possible?  The <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Logging+Configuration" rel="nofollow">logging configuration guide</a> didn't speak to how to do this.</p>
