<p>Wildfly has classpath isolation ( <a href="http://wildfly.org/about/" rel="nofollow" title="No more jar hell">No more jar hell!</a> ) , so can I expect my application to work correctly, given that it is packaged with older version of hibernate ( 3.6.0.Final ),without interference with the one that ships with wildfly 8  ?</p>  <p>Has anybody faced any issues having older version of hibernate running with Wildfly ? </p>
