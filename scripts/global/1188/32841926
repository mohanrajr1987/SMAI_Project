<p>I have a rar which internally has within it the <code>jffi-1.2.9-native.jar</code> library - and loading this rar causes the jvm to segfault - with the following error:</p>  <pre><code> Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: You have loaded library  &lt;path  to&gt;/wildfly/standalone/tmp/vfs/deployment/deploymentb41f06df572811e7/jffi-1.2.9-native.jar-d3417b30dd3cfd1/contents/jni/x86_64-Windows/jffi-1.2.dll  which might have disabled stack guard. The VM will try to fix the  stack guard now. It's highly recommended that you fix the library with  'execstack -c &lt;libfile&gt;', or link it with '-z noexecstack'.  # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:  #  #  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f9f0990e938, pid=28629, tid=140320456898304  #  # JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_40-b25) (build 1.8.0_40-25)  # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.40-b25 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops)  # Problematic frame:  # C  [ld-linux-x86-64.so.2+0x6938]  _dl_map_object_from_fd+0x898 </code></pre>  <p>What I don't understand is why this is trying to load this dll when the platform that I'm running on is:</p>  <pre><code>Linux &lt;machine&gt; 3.0.101-0.15-default #1 SMP Wed Jan 22 15:49:03 UTC 2014 (5c01f4e) x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux </code></pre>  <p>My question is - has anyone seen this kind of problem before - and what causes the windows dll to be loaded here?</p>
