<p>We defined a data source for Oracle in standalone.xml.Instead of defining the username and password tags in the standalone.xml as we dont know the values, requirement is we need to get the username and password from .orapwd file .</p>  <p>We are provided with the path of the password file(.orapwd file). I found that we can define security domain in standalone.xml with module option where we pass value of file path. I also found article refering to creating a custom login module but not sure if we can parse the .orapwd file.</p>  <p>Please can you let me know if this is possible and if so is there any documentation or article which can guide me.</p>
