<p>I have in a EAR two different .WAR files(A.war and B.war). The EAR file is deployed in an JBOSS server 4.0.5</p>  <p>Currently I have defined in A.WAR several user with their own permissions. In A.war the user is able to navigate to some screen that are stored in B.WAR( some JSF screen from B are embedded in A ) . The problem that I have is I need to check in B.WAR the current user and their permissions. All this data is assigned in A.war.</p>  <p>How can I say to B what is the user than is accessing?</p>  <p>How is possible to share the user permission between WAR files? It is possible?</p>
