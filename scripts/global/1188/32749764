<p>All. I am very new to jboss and resteasy.</p>  <p>I am having a trouble with finding a tutorial for integrating JBoss JAAS into Resteasy JAX-RS. </p>  <p>I would like to provide two restful APIs in resteasy application: one is used for logging-in and the other one is for logging-out. </p>  <p>in the logging-in method, I would like to create a LoginContext object with user credentials from the request and call its LoginContext.login method to authenticate the user. After that, set a cookie on the request. (I don't really know if this is possible, I know I can create/modify cookie header with resteasy, but I am not sure about if it's possible to "convert" that LoginContext to a session id) </p>  <p>another solution I can think of is to create a session id and keep a mapping between that session id with LoginContext. However, that would significantly increase complexity of the resteasy application which I would like to avoid. (it also doesn't make sense if there is no conventional way to automatically bind these information to a web session)</p>  <p>Any suggestions/solutions are welcome. a sample code or tutorial would be much appreciate. </p>  <p><em>I am using is JBoss AS 6 and resteasy-jaxrs-2.1.0.GA.jar.</em> </p>
