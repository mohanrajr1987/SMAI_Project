<p>I am seeing several errors in my <strong>standalone-full.xml</strong> in a maven project in eclipse. The following line (one of many) has errors displayed.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;socket-binding name="management-http" interface="management" port="${jboss.management.http.port:9990}"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Multiple annotations found at this line:     - cvc-attribute.3: The value '${jboss.management.http.port:9990}' of attribute 'port' on element 'socket-binding' is not valid with respect   to its     type, 'unsignedShort'.     - cvc-datatype-valid.1.2.1: '${jboss.management.http.port:9990}' is not a valid value for 'integer'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I realize this is because the jboss properties are not being picked up. However "jboss.home" is recognized.</p>  <p>Has anyone seen this before? Thanks in advance.</p>
