<p>Application structure description: Ear application with ejb module (.jar), jboss-seam (.jar) and war module (.war).</p>  <p>I have a <code>StartupAction.class</code> (seam component) annotated with <code>org.jboss.seam.annotations.Startup</code>. During application deployment I need to get the resource from application.war module root (<em>application.war/pages/page.xhtml</em>) and <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> (<em>application.war/WEB-INF/classes/file.properties</em>)</p>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Jboss 4.2</strong>  <code>Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("file.properties")</code> would fetch the file from <em>application.war/WEB-INF/classes/file.properties.</em></p></li> <li><p><strong>Jboss 7.1.1</strong><br> Code from above doesn't work with Jboss 7.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I know that the class loading changed but I can't figure it out how to get into <em>application.war</em> in jboss 7.</p>  <p>Is it possible to do this? Are there any example of this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
