<p>I have created a docker image from a dockerfile, started it on a local VM (boot2docker), and verified from application server logs that it is running and deployed ok. However, I am not able to connect to the AS from my Windows client.</p>  <p>The end of my dockerfile:</p>  <pre><code>RUN echo "JAVA_OPTS=\"\$JAVA_OPTS -Djboss.bind.address=0.0.0.0 -Djboss.bind.address.management=0.0.0.0\"" &gt;&gt; $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.conf  # Expose ports EXPOSE 9990 9999 8080 80 8787  # Start server ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/jboss-eap-6.3/bin/standalone.sh"] </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried adding "-p 8080:8080" when running the container. Browser does not open the welcome page, and telnetting "192.168.99.100 8080" (IP of the VM) does not go through. Any ideas to why I cannot connect from my windows client to  VM running the AS in container? I am able to ssh to the VM, so connection otherwise is not an issue.</p>
