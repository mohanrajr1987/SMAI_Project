<p>I'm trying to replace the default session manager to use Object Grid.  Although this post is in <a href="https://developer.jboss.org/thread/220840" rel="nofollow">reference</a> to AS 7.11 it's been my only guide thus far.  Based on Paul's instructions, I believe I have been successful in registering my implementation of <code>org.jboss.as.clustering.web.DistributedCacheManagerFactory</code> because I see the print statements I have in its constructor in the console.  I have also added additional print statements to methods within my implementation.  Namely, <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>sessionCreated</code>.  To test this I created a sample web application that creates a new session using <code>HttpServletRequest#getSession(true)</code>.  I don't see these statements in the console.</p>  <p>What else should I be doing to have my implementation used?</p>
