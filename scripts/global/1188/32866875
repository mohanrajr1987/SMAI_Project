<p>I'm trying to add a RESTful web service with RESTeasy to our application running on JBoss 7.x, using Seam2.</p>  <p>I wanted to use as little Seam as possible, but I need it for Dependancy Injection.</p>  <p>My REST endpoints are as follows:</p>  <pre><code>@Name("myEndpoint") @Stateless @Path("/path") @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON+"; charset=UTF-8") public class MyEndpoint {   @In private FooService fooService;    @GET   @Path("/foo/{bar}")   public Response foobar(@CookieParam("sessionId") String sessionId,                               @PathParam("bar") String bar)   { ... } } </code></pre>  <p>I'm using a class extending <code>Application</code>. There is no XML config. I can use the web service methods and they work, but I always get an <code>IllegalStateException</code>:</p>  <pre><code>Exception processing transaction Synchronization after completion: java.lang.IllegalStateException: No event context active </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://pastebin.com/HndS1HTJ" rel="nofollow">Complete StackTrace</a></p>  <p>I did try everything in the <a href="http://docs.jboss.com/seam/2.1.2/reference/en-US/html/webservices.html#d0e21974" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, but I can't get it away. If I leave out the <code>@Stateless</code> annotation, I don't get any Injection done. Adding <code>@Scope</code> doesn't do jack. Accessing the service via <code>seam/resource/</code> doesn't even work (even without the Application class with <code>@ApplicationPath</code>).</p>  <p><s>It goes away if I don't use Dep. Injection, but instead add to <em>each and every method</em> </p>  <pre><code>fooService = Component.getInstance("fooService"); Lifecycle.beginCall(); ... Lifecycle.endCall(); </code></pre>  <p>which isn't really a good solution.</s> Nah, doesn't work either...</p>
