<p>I have a csv file with rows like mentioned below.</p>  <pre><code>{name:Test1,type:X1},{name:Test2,type:X2},{name:Default,type:X1},{name:Test3,type:X1},{name:Test4,type:X2} </code></pre>  <p>I need to remove only parts of type X1. After removal the row should look like this </p>  <pre><code>,{name:Test2,type:X2},,,{name:Test4,type:X2} </code></pre>  <p>I tried sed command with regex like this..</p>  <pre><code>sed -i 's/^{name:(?=[A-Z0-9]*).*,type:X1}$//g' abc.csv </code></pre>  <p>After execution nothing is getting replaced or no errors.</p>  <p>I am new to Unix environment. Kindly let me know, what is the mistake i am doing here?</p>
