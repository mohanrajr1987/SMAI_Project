<p>I have a series of files that uses fixed with delimiting, instead of comma separated delimiting. They all look like this:</p>  <pre><code>2015/09/29 659027 RIH619 25 105.80IN921186 2015/09/29 659027 RIH619 25 105.80IN921186 2015/09/29 659027 RIH619 25 105.80IN921186 2015/09/29 659027 RIH619 25 105.80IN921186 </code></pre>  <p>I would like to replace all the spaces with commas. I have a piece of code that accomplish this:</p>  <pre><code>sed -r 's/^\s+//;s/\s+/,/g' </code></pre>  <p>After running the code I get this result:</p>  <pre><code>2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80IN921186 2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80IN921186 2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80IN921186 2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80IN921186 </code></pre>  <p>My problem is the files I get doesn't have a space between the amount and the reference. My output needs to look like this:</p>  <pre><code>2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80,IN921186 2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80,IN921186 2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80,IN921186 2015/09/29,659027,RIH619,25,105.80,IN921186 </code></pre>  <p>What I tried is:</p>  <pre><code>sed -r 's/^\s+//;s/\.\d\d\D+/\.\d\d,\D/;s/\s+/,/g' </code></pre>  <p>But it didn't seem to do anything</p>
