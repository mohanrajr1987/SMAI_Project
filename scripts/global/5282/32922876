<p>How do find multiple words that might be split by newlines, without removing the newlines?</p>  <p>E.g. </p>  <pre><code>The promotion and merchandise aided the success of We Are the World and raised over $63 million for humanitarian aid in Africa and the US. </code></pre>  <p>Use sed (or any *nix text processing tool, e.g. awk, perl) to search for <code>We Are the World</code> and replace it with e.g. <code>&lt;song title&gt;</code> so it appears as:</p>  <pre><code>The promotion and merchandise aided the success of &lt;song title&gt; and raised over $63 million for humanitarian aid in Africa and the US. </code></pre>  <p>I have a bunch of search patterns (song titles) that I want to search pieces of text for and replace all of them with <code>&lt;song title&gt;</code>. I do not want to remove the newlines.</p>
