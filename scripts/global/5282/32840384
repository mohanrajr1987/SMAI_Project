<p>I have a file <code>input.txt</code> that has contains the following:</p>  <pre><code>Summary at desired time : 58 s </code></pre>  <p>The idea would be to perform a sed to replace the "8 s" for "8 : s"</p>  <pre><code>Summary at desired time : 58 : s </code></pre>  <p>For the moment I have tried the following, but it is not doing the what I want. It is performing the substitution of [0-9] by the pattern "[0-9]", but I want the same [0-9]</p>  <pre><code>sed 's/[0-9] [a-Z]/[0-9] : [a-Z]/g' input.txt </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas for overcoming this problem?</p>
