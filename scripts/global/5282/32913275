<p>I'm trying to add one more line to my posts in Octopress. It's</p>  <p><code>comments: true</code> </p>  <p>I have about 200 posts so I would like to do it in one go. I was testing with this but it doesn't seem to work. </p>  <pre><code>echo title: 'Blah Blah.' | sed "s/'title: .*'/'title: .*'\n'comments: true'\n/g" </code></pre>  <p>The result I want is.</p>  <pre><code>title: 'Blah Blah.' comments: true </code></pre>
