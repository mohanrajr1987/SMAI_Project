<p>I am trying to write a sed command so it replaces a possible asterisk at the beginning of a string (it's for renaming a bunch of git branches at the same time).</p>  <p>My <code>git branch</code> returns lines similar to these:</p>  <pre><code>  old-12345 * old-23456   old-34567   master </code></pre>  <p>I want sed to output each line of the above output that has old as:</p>  <pre><code>new-12345 new-23456 new-34567 </code></pre>  <p>I assumed one of the following would work:</p>  <pre><code>$ echo "* old-12345" | sed 's/\*?\s*old-\(\d*\)/new-\1/' $ echo "* old-12345" | sed 's/[*]?\s*old-\(\d*\)/new-\1/' </code></pre>  <p>but sadly it did nothing. I want to have <code>\*?</code> or <code>[*]?</code> since <code>git branch</code> only puts the <code>*</code> next to the branch I am currently on. Why isn't the <code>?</code> working as I expect?</p>
