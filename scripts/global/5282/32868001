<p>I'am working on parsing SMS numbers from email messages and I got one problem. I'am using awk and sed in bash script. The format of phone number is <code>SMS: +XXX XXX XXX XXX</code> . When there is this string included in email body i need to send SMS with subject. All working well so far but I got an issue when there is this string multiple on one line or after some web link. Currently I'am using this to parse phone numbers into array and then create files with number in name. </p>  <pre><code>phone=( $( awk /SMS/ $FILE | awk '{ gsub (" ", "", $0); print}' ) ) </code></pre>  <p>Works fine when there is SMS string on separate lines. I need same to parse string when there is more strings on one line:  <code>SMS: +123 456 789 123   SMS: +456 789 123 456</code> or <code>http://somelink/to/some/web/page.html SMS: +123 456 789 123</code> Basically it would be best to parse whole file and find anything after <code>SMS:</code> which is in format <code>+XXX XXX XXX XXX</code> . Also it is not sure that after last digit will be line break - so it might be between 2 separate strings.  Thanks for help.</p>
