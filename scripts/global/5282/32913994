<p>So in React 0.12 having <code>/** @jsx React.DOM */</code> at the top of all jsx files is no longer necessary. A library that I'm using actually throws an error when it sees the <code>/** @jsx React.DOM */</code> line that exists at the top of every jsx file.</p>  <p>So I wanted to know if there was a quick way using sed to remove this line from every file within a directory.</p>  <p>Should I just remove line 1, or is there a way for me to pattern match, and verify that it's at the top? Also how would one recursively remove it from all files within a directory, and it's subdirectories?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
