<p>I give up... of the following</p>  <pre><code>15 Sep 1605.00 (SPX1530U1605-E),0.25,0.0,0.05,0.10,0,87 </code></pre>  <p>I want to extract the number 1530 out of the blob. "SPX" can be any combination of capital letters [A-Z] and varies in length, (e.g. GOOG, FB). There is always a capital letter following the number, as in "U" in the example.</p>  <p>Below gets the second number, 1605. I'm at loss on how to extract 1530.</p>  <pre><code>echo "15 Sep 1605.00 (SPX1530U1605-E),0.0,0.0,266.10,284.60,0,0" | \ gsed -r 's/.*[A-Z]([0-9].*)[-][A-Z].*/\1/g' </code></pre>  <p>It would be acceptable to perform the operation on just the string "SPXW1530I1605-E" rather than the entire line.</p>
