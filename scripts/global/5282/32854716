<p>Consider the following command:</p>  <pre><code>ssh MACHINE sed -i 's#\[ "\$JBOSS_MODE" = "standalone" \]#\[ "\$JBOSS_MODE" = "sim_standalone" \]#' /tmp/sim-wildfly </code></pre>  <p>When I run this command from the command line, I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>sed: -e expression #1, char 3: unterminated `s' command </code></pre>  <p>However, when I SSH into that particular machine first, and then run the <code>sed</code> part of the command, it works fine:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; ssh MACHINE &gt; sed -i 's#\[ "\$JBOSS_MODE" = "standalone" \]#\[ "\$JBOSS_MODE" = "sim_standalone" \]#' /tmp/sim-wildfly </code></pre>  <p>Any idea why this would happen?</p>  <p>EDIT: I believe it has something to do with how I'm escaping characters, because I just tried simple test replacement with no escaped characters and it worked fine. I tried double-escaping, but that didn't work either.</p>
