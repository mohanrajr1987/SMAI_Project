<p>Using <em>sed</em>, how can I replace characters following a keyword, but <strong>only</strong> within x characters following the end of said keyword. For example, assume the string:</p>  <p><code>foo bar baz quz</code></p>  <p>Let us assume that the keyword is <code>bar</code> and that character <em>z</em> is to be replaced with character <em>t</em>, but only within 3 characters of the end of the keyword (not counting whitespaces).</p>  <p>The desired result would be:</p>  <p><code>foo bar bat quz</code></p>  <p>EDIT: I guess that the usage of <em>extended regular expressions</em> may be indicated here, but am uncertain as to how.</p>  <p><code>sed -re 's/(::bar) some_regex_magic_here /' infile</code></p>
