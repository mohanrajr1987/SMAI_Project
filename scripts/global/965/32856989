<p>I'm looking for a Visual Studio plugin that will allow me to right click a class name and from the shortcut menu get the AssemblyQualifiedName?</p>  <p>I know I can dump it to the console fairly easily with a line of code and copy and paste it, but it would be really useful if you could just right click the class name in your code and select "Copy AssemblyQualifiedName".</p>  <p>Anyone know of any plugins that will do that?</p>
