<p>So I was just playing with the idea of user plugins. I wrote a simple class that prints out a String. Then I wrote an interface which requires a single method for editing that String. Now, Id like to have the user be able to insert a Jar file into a folder (packaged with the program) and my program reads it in, and uses it as a class which implements the interface which I created. So basically I am looking for a way of reading in a jar files contents, and using its class as one of my programs classes. Apologies in advanced for any incorrect terminology, I am very new to this. If this is the wrong way to approaching the problem let me know, Im open to a better way. Thanks! </p>  <p><strong>Class:</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class Project {     static String message = "default message";     public static void main(String args[]) {         System.out.println(message);     } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Interface:</strong> </p>  <pre><code>public interface Mod {     void modifyText(String moddedMessage); } </code></pre>  <p><strong>User Plugin</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class UserMod implements Mod {      public void modifyText(String moddedMessage) {         moddedMessage = "New Message";         Project.message = moddedMessage;      } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
