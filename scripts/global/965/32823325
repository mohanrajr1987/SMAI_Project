<p>I have this plugin that load a banner by modifying the final output during the event "onAfterRender"</p>  <p>Example code:</p>  <pre><code>public function onAfterRender {     $content = JResponse::getBody();      /* Separator */      ... $content ... // adding the banner      /* Separator */      JResponse::setBody($content); } </code></pre>  <p>This works in many Joomla sites but in this homepage (<a href="http://www.francescopazzagli.com/j3cleandemo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.francescopazzagli.com/j3cleandemo/</a>) the plugin doesnt't execute and the banner doesn't appear</p>  <p>While in other pages it execute and the banner appear, example: <a href="http://www.francescopazzagli.com/j3cleandemo/azienda.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.francescopazzagli.com/j3cleandemo/azienda.html</a></p>  <p>What could be the problem? someone has already had experiences like that?</p>
