<p>I'm trying to create a WordPress site where people pay a subscription fee to make a profile with a few photos, information about themselves etc. The profiles that are created are then to be viewed by anybody (it including those who haven't paid to create a profile themselves) in a sort of directory. </p>  <p>I've seen a few plugins that allow users to create their own profile (like this one: <a href="https://ultimatemember.com" rel="nofollow">https://ultimatemember.com</a>), and a few that allow subscription-based access to content (like this one: <a href="http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/</a>), but none that make it possible to combine both of these things in the way I have described - does anyone have any idea how I could go about doing this, either with one plugin or a combination of several?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>Tom</p>
