<p>I am writing a plugin for a 3rd party app (which I only have the .EXE and dot net .DLL for). </p>  <p>The way I code the plugin is by creating a Visual Studio C# library project, add the .EXE and .DLL files from the 3rd party app as references, then extend the <em>IPlugin</em> class defined in the .DLL.</p>  <p>After I build my project I take my plugin's .DLL and copy it to the 3rd party application's Plugins directory then start the application. From that point on I really don't know what happens at that point. I guess the application dynamically loads my DLL by scanning the <em>Plugins</em> folder then loads it (all that stuff I know nothing about).</p>  <p>At that point the application is running as a .EXE. </p>  <p>Is there a way I can use Visual Studio to attach to the .EXE (process) and then debug my DLL code that's running from withing that process?</p>  <p>I know my code is "in there" somewhere but since it's not an .EXE I don't see how I could attach to it. Thank you,</p>  <p>Jan</p>
