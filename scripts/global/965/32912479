<p>Is there a WP plugin available that will turn the text of my articles into links to other articles based on the title of the articles it is linking to.</p>  <p>For example, if I have an article called Article1 and the text of article2 contains the string Article1 then that text will be automatically converted to a link to Article1.</p>  <p>I have tried a bunch of plugins, but I might be using the wrong settings or something.  So far I have not been able to make any of them work like this.</p>
