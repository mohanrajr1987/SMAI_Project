<p>I have a recurrent problem with Eclipse: when I try to launch my plugin Eclipse application, it often opens a new tab to "attach a missing source" in jre7\lib\rt.jar. I must be a bug since it usually works and I have never modified that file.</p>  <p>There is a screen of the problem: <a href="http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/436657Bug.png" rel="nofollow">http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/436657Bug.png</a></p>  <p>The only way I found to fix it is to delete the ".metadata" of the project each time it does that... and to loose all my preferences, breakpoints and so.</p>
