<p>I'm trying to extend the php class GFFormsModel the Wordpress Gravity Forms Plugin. The reason is that I need to add an additional WHERE clause to the private static function get_search_where( $form_id, $search_criteria )</p>  <p>I can extend the main GFFroms class and override public static function loaded() or public static function init() but that doesn't help.  GFFormsModel is loaded via require_once and functions are just called statically. </p>  <p>So far I'm loading my class via a separate plugin.. </p>  <p>require_once( plugin_dir_path( <strong>FILE</strong> ) . 'includes/cpgfforms.php' );</p>  <p>And extending...</p>  <p>class MyFormsModel extends GFFormsModel {</p>  <pre><code>public static function search_lead_ids( $form_id, $search_criteria = array()    )...... </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>But it's not loading. I expect I need to be loading it much earlier or just missing something obvious.</p>  <p>Any ideas would be gratefully appreciated.</p>
