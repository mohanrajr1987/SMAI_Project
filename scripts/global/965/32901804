<p>I recently installed a plugin named WP Google Search on my Wordpress. This plugin allows you to create a widget with a custom search engine powered by google.</p>  <p>What I am trying to understand is, how to override the original Wordpress searching function by replacing it with the custom google search?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance, </p>  <p>Fred.</p>
