<p>I have recently installed the Atom text editor on Mac OSX, and wanted to further install one of Atom's many packages, more specifically the "terminal panel," which can be read about <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-terminal-panel" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>What this essentially does is allow the Atom user to quickly access a terminal window (or windows) to test the code during editing. </p>  <p>I installed it fine (I think, anyway), but quickly found an issue: when my code prompts the user for input, the terminal doesn't allow any more input from me (the user), and the only option I have left is to either "kill" or "destroy" the program, neither of which sound constructive.</p>  <p>I searched the internet for what could possibly be the reason behind this, but I have found nothing. Does anyone have advice on what I could do?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance. </p>
