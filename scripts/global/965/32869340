<p>What is the best way to save plugins to an external dropins folder (say on some share)? Until now I always downloaded plugins using the marketplace or some site, and afterwards checked the plugins and features folders of my eclipse for new files/folders and moved them to the external dropins folder. This can be very painful, if you have several other plugins installed locally. Is there no way to tell eclipse where to store downloaded plugins? Or some other way to download plugins to some specific folder outside eclipse? Any suggestions are appreciated.</p>
