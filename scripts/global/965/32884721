<p>I'm using Maven and JBehave for integration test. I'm using the tomcat7 maven plugin as well that start running before the integration run so that I can write jBehave stories that hit my api.</p>  <p>I'm now trying now include Wiremock because I have some external HTTP calls thatI would like to mock, wiremock seems like the perfect solution.</p>  <p>I'd prefer not to write any mock stub in java and I saw on the Wiremock doc that there is a standalone mode where you simply put your files and mapping in a folder I wire mock will pick them up when necessary.</p>  <p>I have included this in my pom.xml</p>  <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;       &lt;groupId&gt;com.github.tomakehurst&lt;/groupId&gt;       &lt;artifactId&gt;wiremock&lt;/artifactId&gt;       &lt;version&gt;1.57&lt;/version&gt;       &lt;classifier&gt;standalone&lt;/classifier&gt;       &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;       &lt;exclusions&gt;         &lt;exclusion&gt;           &lt;groupId&gt;*&lt;/groupId&gt;           &lt;artifactId&gt;*&lt;/artifactId&gt;         &lt;/exclusion&gt;       &lt;/exclusions&gt;     &lt;/dependency&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but when I run the integration test I get this</p>  <pre><code>SEVERE: A child container failed during start java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException: Failed to start component [StandardEngine[Tomcat].StandardHost[localhost]]  Caused by: java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: loader (instance of org/apache/catalina/loader/WebappClassLoader) previously initiated loading for a different type with name "javax/servlet/ServletContext" </code></pre>  <p>the embedded tomcat7 fails to run. Could someone help me setting up wire mock in standalone mode with maven?</p>
