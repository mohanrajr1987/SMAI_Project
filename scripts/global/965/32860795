<p>I am a newbie and am trying to setup a blog. I have a question related to a  plugin. I am using super socializer and have enabled it for social commenting on blog. Problem is that if I enable the social commenting the comment box kind of resizes and I cant see post button and need to press tab on keyboard to bring up the button. If I keep the social commenting disabled , the comment box shows up properly. I dont know which part of css needs to be adjusted so comment box comes up in full height so the buttons are visible.</p>  <p>The page is at <a href="http://www.myinvestingedge.com/?p=146" rel="nofollow">http://www.myinvestingedge.com/?p=146</a>.  </p>  <p>I will really appreciate your help. </p>
