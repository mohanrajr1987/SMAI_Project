<p>I'd like to implement a small feature (getting default <code>Style</code>s and <code>ControlTemplate</code>s for WPF controls) that is missing in SharpDevelop vs. Visual Studio. I'm facing the problem that I do not understand what is considered to be the public API surface for the <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop/tree/master/src/AddIns/DisplayBindings/WpfDesign/WpfDesign.Designer/Project" rel="nofollow">WpfDesign.Designer</a> addin that I'd like to extend.</p>  <p>Is there an established mechanism for addins to declare in what ways other addins may extend them (addins extending other addins is explicitly allowed in the SharpDevelop architecture)?</p>
