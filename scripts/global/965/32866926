<p>Greeting to everyone!</p>  <hr>  <p>I'm trying to start use of Teamcity Unity3d-runner-plugin. After Successful install on server and setup build step in project , it is unable to build project. Project doesn't start to work with warning message:</p>  <p>Warning: No enabled compatible agents for this build configuration. Please register a build agent or tweak the build configuration requirements.</p>  <p>on the Agent Requirement page there is a message</p>  <p><strong>agent</strong> (disconnected) <strong>Incompatible runner</strong>: Unity <strong>Unmet requirements</strong>: unity.latest exists</p>  <hr>  <p>Unity was installed in default folder, and works fine with no problem, that's why i can't understand, why does plugin can't see Unity env.parameter on agent.</p>  <p>Anyone know how can it be solved?</p>
