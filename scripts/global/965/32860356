<p>I am currently using this plugin: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-button-plugin/" rel="nofollow">https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-button-plugin/</a> to show a Facebook like an share button on my multisite subsites, but it slows my site down a lot.</p>  <p>I want to make the buttons lazy load, or maybe create a small plugin that does the same thing. I have tried the existing social buttons lazy load plugins for Wordpress, but none of them work perfect will all the subsites. It is only the plugin above that does..</p>  <p>This is the buttons i am using right now: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H2CsG.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/H2CsG.png</a></p>
