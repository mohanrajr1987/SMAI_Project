<p>I'm developing a plugin that has an action which decide the view to render according to data properties: </p>  <p>example: </p>  <pre><code>class ProfilesController extends MyPluginAppController {      public function myaction($id){         //..omitting checks..         $profile = $this-&gt;Profile-&gt;read(null,$id);          //Stuff          if($this-&gt;hasDedicatedViewFor($profile)){              $this-&gt;render('profiles'.DS.$this-&gt;getDedicatedViewFor($profile));         }          //Else render default action view      }  } </code></pre>  <p>While this controller was inside the APP  everything was working right,  after moving into Plugin, cake says:</p>  <pre><code>Error: Confirm you have created the file:      .../app/View/Plugin/MyPlugin/Profiles/myaction_secondary.ctp </code></pre>  <p>While I'd expect to load it from:</p>  <pre><code>.../plugins/MyPlugin/View/Profiles/myaction_secondary.ctp      </code></pre>
