<p>I'm writing a custom plugin. I call various scripts for the admin using the "admin_enqueue_scripts" hook, and other scripts for the front-end using the  'wp_enqueue_scripts' hook. The admin hook works fine but on the front-end the wp_enqueue_scripts isn't working at all. I stripped everything out of this function and just tested with an error log and a print to screen but still nothing. Does anybody know why the hook isn't being used? I also tried the hook "init" but same problem. Here's the original code:</p>  <pre><code>function setup_scripts_and_styles(){     wp_enqueue_script( 'slideshow', plugins_url( '/js/slideshow.js' , __FILE__ ));     wp_enqueue_style('style-css', plugins_url( '/css/style.css' , __FILE__ )); } add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts',' setup_scripts_and_styles'); </code></pre>
