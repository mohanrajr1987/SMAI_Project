<p>I have a gradient that I am currently using that I would like converted from -webkit to the default linear-gradient. I have tried using all of the CSS generating tools online to import the code in order to see the other browser specific variants, but for some reason when I import the code the gradient in the results section just becomes white.</p>  <pre><code>    background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0 0, 100% 0, from(white), to(white), color-stop(50%, black)); </code></pre>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Hybridx24/7Lcanuwx/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle Sample</a></p>
