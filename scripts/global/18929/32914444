<p>In my example, I'm using <a href="http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/" rel="nofollow">"Bob" by Ian Lunn</a>. I really like the Hover effect, but as soon as I stop hovering it jolts back to it's original position. How can I ease my div back to it's regular position?</p>  <p><strong>Animation CSS:</strong></p>  <pre><code>animation-name: hvr-bob-float, hvr-bob; animation-duration: .3s, 1.5s; animation-delay: 0s, .3s; animation-timing-function: ease-out, ease-in-out; animation-iteration-count: 1, infinite; animation-fill-mode: forwards; animation-direction: normal, alternate; </code></pre>  <p><strong>jsfiddle:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/v3z9rLae/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/v3z9rLae/</a></p>
