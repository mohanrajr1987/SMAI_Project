<p>I am just trying to implement Secured Upload functionality. Instead of asking user to select a file to upload, I have a textarea where user can paste the contents. I will parse it in JS.</p>  <p>I want to limit based on size not based on number of character. If it is number of charatcters, then I can easily implement it in JS</p>  <p><strong>Doubts</strong></p>  <p>1) Is it safe to limit data based on size?</p>  <p>2) I am new to JS. In C, One char is one byte. So I can calculate size easily. In JS, How can I do that?</p>  <p>3) If JS is also same as C style sizing, then does it browser dependent?</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>I am not interested in <code>max length</code> property of <code>text area</code>.</p>  <p><strong>SIZE</strong></p>  <p>I mean size by kilo bytes, mega bytes,..</p>
