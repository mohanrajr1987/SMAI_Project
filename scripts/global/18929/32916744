<p>I have a div with an inset box shadow and there are links in that div that I want the shadow to display over, but still have the links be clickable.</p>  <p>Here's an example: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/5rsbn927/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/5rsbn927/</a></p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="navigation" role="navigation"&gt; &lt;div id="navbar" role="navigation"&gt; &lt;!-- this div has shadow --&gt;     &lt;a href="#" id="link1"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#" id="link2"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#" id="link3"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#" id="link4"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#" id="link5"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#" id="link6"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The #navbar div has the shadow and the links are all inline-blocks.</p>  <p>I can't seem to get anything to work. z-index (with positioning), pointer-events, :before, none of it has worked so far. The only time I've managed to get the shadow to show above the links, they aren't clickable.</p>  <p>For the record here's how it's supposed to look; I just want to change the background but keep the same shadow when the link is hovered over: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rOe6uH1.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/rOe6uH1.png</a> (also I changed the color in the jsfiddle just so it's easier to see).</p>  <p>At this point I don't really care if it needs jQuery or something other than box-shadow; it just needs to look right.</p>
