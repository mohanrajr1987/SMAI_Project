<p>I'm trying to get my font look reasonably the same across mac Chrome, Safari and Firefox (will move on to IE later).</p>  <p>I've been playing with:</p>  <pre><code> -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased; </code></pre>  <p>The font almost looks the same, but safari and firefox it almost looks at least 1 weight thinner.</p>  <p>I also have tried:</p>  <pre><code>-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; </code></pre>  <p>And this for FF:</p>  <pre><code>-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale </code></pre>  <p>Also I have this on:</p>  <pre><code>text-rendering: optimizeLegibility !important; </code></pre>  <p>This gets the fonts to look pretty much the same but it's not as smooth as subpixel antialiased.</p>  <p>Am I missing a property here? I know they are not going to look 100% the same across all browsers but you would think chrome and safari being both webkit browsers they would be the same.</p>  <p>I'm using Raleway from Google fonts if that's any help.</p>
