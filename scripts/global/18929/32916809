<p>Is there any way to get the window aspect ratio in a css media query? I have found the <code>device-aspect-ratio</code>, and <code>device-pixel-ratio</code>, but it seems that it is all possible to get several breakpoints based on pixel size and number of pixels and also device width. Is it not simpler to make website relative to the browser window because the browser window spans over the whole device on mobile phones (for now) but on PC you can resize your window to your wishes? </p>  <p>So is there any workaround or do I need to do some server/client side programming?</p>  <p>Thank you enigma. English is not my first language.</p>
