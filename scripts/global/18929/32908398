<p>I have an index.html and indexcss.css.</p>  <p>My index page is working with the existing CSS codes.</p>  <p>But when I change something in the CSS such as background color and than reload the page I still have the old background color. What could possibly cause this?</p>  <p>When I copy paste the code to jsbin and change the background color there it works fine but on my browsers nothing happen.</p>  <p>I've tried it both in Firefox and Chrome.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>PS: Changes on the index.html take affect. It's only the CSS that doesn't take affect after reload.</p>
