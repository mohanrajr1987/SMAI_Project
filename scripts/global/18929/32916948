<p>I'm trying to build an equal horizontal menu in CSS which is still supported in older browsers like IE9. (Yes, I know....)</p>  <p>Been testing in FF and Chrome with newer CSS3 techniques and working excellent! Tried in IE9, as we still need to support it.... and failed.</p>  <p>I searched around, and found some of these links which did the trick...</p>  <p><a href="http://lea.verou.me/2011/01/styling-children-based-on-their-number-with-css3/" rel="nofollow">http://lea.verou.me/2011/01/styling-children-based-on-their-number-with-css3/</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19357944/horizontal-menu-with-auto-width-and-same-dimension-of-the-tabs">horizontal menu with auto width and same dimension of the tabs</a></p>  <p>...However if the number of menu items change you need to either change you CSS or cater for X number of menu items with multiple declarations...</p>  <p>Is there a simple one case covers all that will support IE9 and still be compatible with newer browsers without affecting them? (ie: special stylesheet for IE9) </p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
