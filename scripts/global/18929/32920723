<p>How can I get multiple divs to transition/animate on one hover trigger?</p>  <p>See the update here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/hecyn/9/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/hecyn/9/</a> >> CSS-Line:23 All I'm trying to here, is to get .inner and .wrap2 to rotate on one .wrap:hover. Its not working, when I add the "+" selector. How can I right this better.</p>  <p>Primary Question: So simply how can I write this below:</p>  <pre><code>#container:hover + #cube1 + #cube2 + #cube3 { background-color: yellow; } </code></pre>  <p>Second question: Above would be ok, but ultimately Im kinda trying to achieve this via CSS:</p>  <pre><code>#:hoverOverSomething then{    Do this thing;    Do this other thing;    Do this next thing; } </code></pre>  <p>Bear with me, little new to CSS animations... and the net is clouded and without specific simple information. Cheers.</p>
