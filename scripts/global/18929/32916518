<p>I have to show on my website <em>5 images all in one row</em> and they will be resized using media queries so they can fit in the screen. My problem is that for ex. <em>in an iPhone 5S I need to show only 3 images</em> not 5 because is a small screen. In iPad and in devices with a larger screen I need to show 5. So which is the best way to achieve this? Should I get the screen size via JavaScript and pass that size to my server to decide how many images should I get from the database or is there another way to do this? I don't want to use an extra mobile site. </p>  <p>The problem is not only the visual side. Those images need to be updated every X seconds so I need to fetch a different number of images from the database based on the screen.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
