<p>I have a column from a Dataset taken from an SQL server database and I want it to be placed down in my Invoice template as a <code>Combo Box</code>, but for some reason it isn't let me use this functionality.  It worked fine when I had a blank Word Document, now it isn't working.  Any help is appreciated!  PrintScreen wouldn't display cursor, so I just did it in paint to show what it looked like.  Cursor just displays an <code>O</code> with a <code>/</code> through it and won't let me place the content control down.</p>  <p><strong>Picture of the issue</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qH2Bc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qH2Bc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
