<p>I am inserting 700K records from SQL to DB2 database. Hence I am using SSIS data flow task for the same. The logic for the Data flow task is from SQL Server OLEDB Source to ADO.NET destination. The insertion is happening at very slow rate. It is inserting 9216 rows per insertion meaning it is inserting 9216 records in one batch. Unlike OLEDB destination we cannot configure number of batch insertions at one go.</p>  <p>I have specify "Use Bulk Insert" option and have increase the connection timeout to 300 (from 30) in ADO.NET destination. Moreover, I have also increased the buffer size of ADO.NET destination to 10,000 from 0.</p>  <p>Is there any way we can speedup the ADO.NET Destination insertions?</p>  <p>P.S: I am using SQL Server 2008 R2 and Visual Studio 2008 BIDS environment.</p>
