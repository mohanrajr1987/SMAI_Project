<p>I've got a legacy database that was created with the database type INTEGER for many (1.000+) Oracle columns. A database with the same structure exists for MS SQL. As I was told, the original definition was created using a tool that generated the scripts from a logical model to the specific one for MS SQL and Oracle.</p>  <p>Using C++ and MFC the columns were mapped nicely to the integer type for both DBMs.</p>  <p>I am porting this application to .NET and C#. The same C# codebase is used to access both MS SQL and Oracle. We use the same DataSets and logic and we need the same types (int32 for both).</p>  <p>The ODP.NET driver from Oracle maps them to Decimal. This is logical as Oracle created the integer columns as NUMBER(37) automatically. The columns in MS SQL map to int32.</p>  <p>Can I somehow control how to map the types in the ODP.NET driver? I would like to say something like "map NUMBER(37) to int32". The columns will never hold values bigger than the limits of an int32. We know this because it is being used in the MS SQL version.</p>  <p>Alternatively, can I modify all columns from NUMBER(37) to NUMBER(8) or SIMPLE_INTEGER so that they map to the right type for us? Many of these columns are used as primary keys (think autoincrement).</p>
