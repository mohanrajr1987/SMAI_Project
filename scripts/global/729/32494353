<p>I have code that is possibly fragile. This statement here</p>  <pre><code> int countDis = (int)cmd.ExecuteScalar(); </code></pre>  <p>If I change the stored procedure to not return ANYTHING, then that casting to <code>(int)</code> is going to blow up. If I simply remove it, then I cannot compile.  </p>  <p>What is the best code practice for defensive coding in this situation?</p>
