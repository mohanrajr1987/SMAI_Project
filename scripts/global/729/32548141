<p>I'm trying to understand why when I use a single thread application  with the following code </p>  <pre><code>    public void Run(object state)     {         using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))         {             using (var command = new SqlCommand("UpdatePriceInterval", connection))             {                 command.CommandType = System.Data.CommandType.StoredProcedure;                            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8000; i++)                 {                     command.ExecuteNonQuery();                 }             }         }     } </code></pre>  <p>for the following code I'm getting a result of about 230 per second</p>  <p>Now if I try to do it with tasks (and of course change inside the loop to 80 iterations </p>  <pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {     list.Add(Task.Factory.StartNew(Run, cancel, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning)); } </code></pre>  <p>I'm getting a total result of about 3 second slower.(i'm running on localhsot i7)</p>  <p>I don't think to sp is the problem (as i deleted all the logic from it)</p>  <p>On SQL profiler i made sure the connection are pooled.</p>  <p>My task manager show everything is regular (cpu memory disk network) nothing is at 100%</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
