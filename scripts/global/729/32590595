<p>I observe a very odd performance behaviour of a stored procedures which my application calls via an <em>ADO.NET</em> connection. The procedure seems gradually to slow down over time so that after about a month it becomes so slow as to exceed a timeout of 240 seconds, but if one <code>ALTER</code>s the procedure without even changing its code, it is cured and completes in about 10 seconds, only to grow slow as cold honey again in another month or so.</p>  <p>When called from the <em>Management Studio</em>, however, it always works like new, so I cannot blame aught but the <em>ADO.NET</em> interface, although I don't understant how it may be changing the performance of the procedure. I open the connection by means of the simplest connection string contaning only the authentification data and do not change any properties of the <code>SqlConnection</code> object.</p>  <p>Could you help me find the cause of this effect?</p>  <p>I have posted the procedure <a href="http://pastebin.com/zRZ6sNNh" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  The code is not mine and I know it is terribly written but that seems not to be related to the problem, and I plan to rewrite it so that it shall be human-readable and then to optimize it.</p>
