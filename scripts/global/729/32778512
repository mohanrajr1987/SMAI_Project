<p>Just started working with Dapper (from Nuget) and couldn't figure out the following:</p>  <p>This works:</p>  <pre><code>_connection.Query&lt;MySalesPerson&gt;(@"select * from Sales.SalesPerson where territoryId = @id",                     new {id = territory.TerritoryID}); </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't works:</p>  <pre><code>_connection.Query&lt;MySalesPerson&gt;(@"select * from Sales.SalesPerson where territoryId = @0",                     new {id = territory.TerritoryID}); </code></pre>  <p>So it's not taking up the numerical placeholders, it this the standard behavior or am I missing out something. Same works like a breeze with PetaPoco</p>
