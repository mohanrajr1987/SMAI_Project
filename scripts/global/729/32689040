<p>I am trying to use "<a href="http://cdn.cdata.com/help/DGA/ado/default.htm" rel="nofollow">CData ADO.NET Provider for MongoDB</a>" with Entity framework 6.0.0, when used with <a href="http://cdn.cdata.com/help/DGA/ado/pg_creatingEntityModel.htm" rel="nofollow">model first approach</a> (model first approach defined by CDATA is more like DB First approach) loading schema from database produces following error with primary key </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error  2   Running transformation: Key Part: 'C_id' for type resturant is not valid. All parts of the key must be non nullable.    (File) Model1.edmx  </p>      <p>Error 3   Error 75: Key Part: 'C_id' for type resturant is not valid. All parts of the key must be non nullable.  (File) Model1.edmx  </p>      <p>Error  4   Error 75: Key Part: '_id' for type resturants is not valid. All parts of the key must be non nullable.  (File) Model1.edmx</p> </blockquote>  <p>has anybody else faced same problem using that provider? What could be possible solution for this error?</p>
