<p>How can I manipulate write the Original Values in a DataSet row?</p>  <p>Why I need to do this?</p>  <p>I need to do this because our new Version of the Database has changed its structure. However, there are still clients out there sending DataSets with the old structure. So I add the required fields on the fly, and I set their values as needed. Then, I should be able to update the Database with the DataAdapters, as usual.</p>  <p>In order to make the DELETE operation work, I should be able to set the original Version of a the primary key fields in the DataSet, because the DataAdapter uses the Original version to construct the parameter value for the Delete Command.</p>  <p>However, I haven't found any way to do this. The following code does not even compile:</p>  <pre><code>ds.Tables["Table"].Rows[0]["NewField",  DataRowVersion.Original]=23; </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
