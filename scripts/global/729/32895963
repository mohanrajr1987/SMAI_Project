<p>I've been trying to connect to a MySQL database which is hosted on a RaspberryPI and I have been having a lot of trouble and wanted to know if it is possible before I continue.</p>  <p>I want to use .Net's Entity Framework 6 on Visual Studio 2013 in the same fashion as you would SQL Server to create Entites from the Database. First of all is this possible?</p>  <p>I have had two problems so far:</p>  <p>Firstly, I have been able to connect to a MySQL database on my local copy but not the Raspberry Pi's even though I have a user which allows any IP and has most privileges (I am connecting through LAN).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zTJxe.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zTJxe.png" alt="Can Login through localhost only"></a></p>  <p>My Second problem is that once I have accessed and picked a database I receive this error, which makes me think that Entity Framework doesn't support MySQL:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DurSN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DurSN.png" alt="Entity error"></a></p>  <p>I am also having a problem logging into my local instance of MySQL when the user has a password, which makes me think this could also be why I can't login to the remote MySQL?</p>
