<p>I am using c# and <code>OdbcConnection</code> to connect to an Access database. Inside the database there is a pre-defined query that I want to run (like a stored proc in Sql Server). This used to be dead easy with the old COM-based ADO but it doesn't seem to work in ADO.net</p>  <pre><code>OdbcConnection conn = AccessConnect.Connect(); var cmd = conn.CreateCommand(); cmd.CommandText = @"MyAccessQuery;"; cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; var da = new OdbcDataAdapter(cmd); var ds = new DataSet(); da.Fill(ds); </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way round it or am I going to have to duplicate my Access query in C# code?</p>
