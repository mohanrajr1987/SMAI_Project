<p>I have a text file with lines as follow: </p>  <pre><code>Image AA 100 100 = # Image AA (2 diagonal line segments) lineTo 100 100 lineTo -100 100 End Image AA # ############################ Image B 10 10 = # Image B (a square) lineTo 390 0 lineTo 0 390 lineTo -390 0 lineTo 0 -390 End Image B Print B </code></pre>  <p>How would I be able to store the lineTo numbers that are associated with AA and then the lineTo numbers associated with B in a separate array without knowing if the file has multiple Images. For example, I mean the file could have Image A, B, C, DD or it could have Image B, C, AA.  There is no set Images other than the max of 16 images in total. I have tried to store the lineTo numbers in an array but when it comes to getting those values back, it is difficult for me to determine which values belonged to AA or B, etc. </p>  <p>I have also tried a struct but I am having difficulties with naming the struct with the varied names. For example</p>  <pre><code>struct images {     char image_names[128];     int x;     int y;  };    while(fgets(temp, MAX_LINE, input_file) != NULL) {    if (strncmp(line, "Image", 5) == 0)    {sscanf(line, "%s %s %d %d", image_command, image_name, &amp;image_first,  &amp;image_second);    struct images image_name = {image.x, image.y};    }    else if (strcmp(line, "lineTo', 6) == 0)    {printf("%d %d\n", image_name.x, image_name.y)     };  }; </code></pre>  <p>When strcmp gets image_name, which would be AA or B in this example, I am trying to make a struct with the name of that image, so usually it would be created with </p>  <pre><code>struct images AA = {100, 100}; </code></pre>  <p>but since the variable image_name isn't actually known to me without reading the file myself, I can't just name it AA, so I am trying to name it with the value stored in image_name. </p>
