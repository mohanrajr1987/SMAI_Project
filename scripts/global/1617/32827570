<p>I am trying to copy only one element from an array of structs into a new element in Matlab. I am new to Matlab, in C I would just use a loop to populate the new array with the exact element I want. Is there no other way to do this in Matlab? eye_record is the array of structs and I would like to copy just the x_pos elements from the entire array into win_x and y. My code is as follows so far.</p>  <p>Thanks for everything in advance!</p>  <pre><code>a = 1; win_x = zeros(length(eye_record)); win_y = zeros(length(eye_record)); disT = 1.0;  for i=1:length(eye_record)     win_x(i) = eye_record(i).x_pos_measured_deg;     win_y(i) = eye_record(i).y_pos_measured_deg;     dis = (max(win_x(a:i)) - min(win_x(a:i)) + (max(win_y(a:i)) - min(win_y(a:i))));     if (dis &lt;= disT)         eye_record(i).xy_movement_EMD = 1;         fixation_counter = fixation_counter + 1;     else         eye_record(i).xy_movement_EMD = 2;         a = i;         saccade_counter = saccade_counter + 1;     end end </code></pre>
