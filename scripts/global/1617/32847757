<p>I have the link to my GIT Hub account for a simple leaderboard application (Question_1_Seg_Fault.c). However, whenever I attempt to enter input everything seems to be okay, and data within the structures is updated. However, when I then attempt to end the application (By typing 0 0 0 0) I receive a segmentation fault. I am fairly new to C, and am hoping this is something rather simple.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ohearonkg/CSCI_2132_Assignment_2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ohearonkg/CSCI_2132_Assignment_2</a></p>  <p>I Within the same repository I also have a second version (Question_1_No_Alterations.c) which does not cause a segmentation fault BUT the data within the structures is not updated.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
