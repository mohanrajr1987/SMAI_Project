<p>For a project I have to use the following definition of Fork: void Fork(VoidFunctionPtr func, int arg);.  I need to pass a struct in as the arg so that I can give the forked function more information, but I keep getting errors because a struct is not a int.  I am attempting to pass two pointers to buffers into the thread so that the data is shared between the threads.  If anyone knows how to trick the function into accepting the struct as an int or another way to accomplish the goal of having shared buffers between threads created by this version of Fork please let me know.  P.S. I cannot use the C++ standard version of Fork because the programming I am doing is very low level.</p>
