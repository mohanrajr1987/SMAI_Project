<p>I do not understand <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366055(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN's documentation</a> for it's member's at all. It ask for things I've never done before like the <code>S_un_b</code> member needs <code>The IPv4 address of the host formatted as four u_chars.</code> which doesn't really make sense to me unless it means something like type casting but I don't think that's it. Any examples, documentation, hints, tips, etc would be very greatly appreciated! :)</p>
