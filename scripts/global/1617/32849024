<p>I am trying to count and print the size of a database within a structure and I have no clue how to go about this. I am assuming I have to use some type of loop but what I am doing seems to be way off. Can someone give me some tips?</p>  <p>Here is my struct:</p>  <pre><code>struct childrensBooks           //Structure of books using pointers     instead of arrays {     char *title;                //use of pointers to store memory for  title     char *author;               //use of pointers to store memory for author     char *publisher;            //use of pointers to store memory for publisher     int copyright;     double price; }; </code></pre>  <p>And here is my loop I have created:</p>  <pre><code>int size(char *title, char *author, char *publisher, int copyright, double price) {     int i = 0;     int records = 0;     for(i=0; i&lt;(struct childrensBooks *)malloc(records * sizeof(struct childrensBooks)); i++)         fprintf(stderr, "The size of the database is: %d\n", i);     free(i); } </code></pre>
