<p>I have an assignment which provides a dataset. I created a struct array and want to input the values but do not know how to input the value without having it repeat in the same array. </p>  <p>For example, there are 18 women in the dataset with the respective events that they attended to. </p>  <p>e.g </p>  <pre><code>Tiffany, E1 Tiffany, E2 Tiffany, E3 Tiffany, E4 Tiffany, E5 Tiffany, E6 Tiffany, E8 Tiffany, E9 Dione, E1 Dione, E2 Dione, E3 Dione, E5 Dione, E6 Dione, E7 Dione, E8 Kelly, E2 Kelly, E3 Kelly, E4 Kelly, E5 Kelly, E6 Kelly, E7 Kelly, E8 Kelly, E9 </code></pre>  <p>What kind of codes can I use so that when I input the dataset, the first struct array is allocated to Tiffany and her respective events E1, E2, E3 etc and the 2nd struct will have Dione and her events that she attended. In the dataset, different women has attended different number of events. I would like to know if it is able to check if the first input which is the first name is the same or not in order to create a new array if it is another woman.</p>
