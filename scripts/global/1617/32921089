<p>Consider the following struct which is a part of FreeBSD kernel:</p>  <pre><code>struct ngm_mkpeer {     char    type[NG_TYPESIZ];               /* peer type */     char    ourhook[NG_HOOKSIZ];            /* hook name */     char    peerhook[NG_HOOKSIZ];           /* peer hook name */     char    owner_msg[10];                  /* owner message */}; </code></pre>  <p>I added owner_msg member to this struct. Given that many applications and services use this struct and owner_msg is filled only in one service, other services panic since owner_msg is not filled. Is there a way to assign a default value in the struct itself?</p>
