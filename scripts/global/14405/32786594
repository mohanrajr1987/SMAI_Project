<p>Okay, so this is something that has already been done so I know it's possible. What I'd like is that, when the user hovers the mouse on some word defined by the <code>wordHoverAssign()</code> function, something would get activated.</p>  <p>So, in a more concise manner: When the page is loaded the text <em>I love potatoes!</em> shows up on screen, created with HTML. Then the function <code>wordHoverAssign("potatoes")</code> is executed. What should happen then, when I hover the word <em>potatoes</em>, is that an alert message would pop up with, for example, this message <em>You hovered the word!</em>.</p>  <p>Is this possible? How would I go about doing it? I'd really like it if I didn't have to use any more frameworks/plugins. I'm using jQuery by the way.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>  <p>My code so far (if you don't feel like setting it up):</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>wordHoverAssign("potatoes");  function wordHoverAssign(theWord) {   //code here }</code></pre> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love potatoes!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
