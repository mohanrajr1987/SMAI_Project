<p>The buttons on my site look great except for when you hover them. When the are hovered over the font turns black and the button turns a light orange only halfway up. The top of the button remains the same. I would like css control over the attributes controlling hover effects but I do not see what is controlling them in the first pace.</p>  <pre><code>      .btn {          background-color: #f45F25;          background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #f47825, #f45F25);          border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) #f47825;          } </code></pre>  <p>The web site is <a href="http://clearwaterfloridabeachrentals2.imbookingsecure.com/" rel="nofollow">http://clearwaterfloridabeachrentals2.imbookingsecure.com/</a> and the button is located at the top right in the Search box.</p>
