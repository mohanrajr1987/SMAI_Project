<p>Why is this CSS being applied inconsistently across frameworks/environments/browsers?</p>  <p>I've got a prototype created in Meteor where the CSS works fine in creating a shadow effect and adding a border to various images as they are hovered; specifically, in the Meteor prototype (it's a Sharepoint app, but testing features like this out is much quicker with Meteor) I have this CSS:</p>  <pre><code>#imgPostTravelTop:hover, #imgPostTravelTopRight:hover, #imgPostTravelCenter:hover, #imgPostTravelBottom:hover {   z-index: 4;     -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 7px #000;     -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 7px #000;     box-shadow: 0 0 7px #000;    border: 1px solid gold; } </code></pre>  <p>It works fine - on mouseenter / hovering into an image, it grows a golden five O'Clock shadow.</p>  <p>However, virtually the same thing in the Sharepoint code:</p>  <pre><code>.finaff-form-help-post-travel-centerimage:hover,  .finaff-form-help-post-travel-bottomimage:hover {     z-index: 4;     -moz-box-shadow: inset 0 0 7px #000;     -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 7px #000;     box-shadow: inset 0 0 7px #000;      border: 1px solid gold; } </code></pre>  <p>...only works in Chrome and Firefox (not in IE8).</p>  <p>I tried this, which supposedly works in IE8:</p>  <pre><code>#imgPostTravel:hover {   zoom: 1;   filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.DropShadow(OffX=5, OffY=5, Color=#ff0000); } </code></pre>  <p>...but it doesn't work (does not add a box-shadow to IE8).</p>  <p>Is there anything I can to do get a box-shadow to work in IE8?</p>
