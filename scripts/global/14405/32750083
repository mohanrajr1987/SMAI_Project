<p>I need to do one thing. I have element on webside. When user hover the mouse on this item i need to for example display alert. But with delay: When user hover the mouse on item and after one second mouse is still on item the alert will display. I can do it but i want to do the same when mouse leave the same item (when mouse leave item and after one second is still outside item). Now i use this code but of course it dosen't work with leaving</p>  <pre><code>$('.test').hover(function(){   mytimeout = setTimeout(function(){     alert("enter");   }, 1000); }, function(){      clearTimeout(mytimeout); });   $('.test').mouseleave(function() {   alert("escape"); }); </code></pre>  <p>Of course i'm not going to use this with alerts ;) I have no idea how to do it. Hover in hover? Or use something else? Thank you for your help and sorry for my english.</p>
