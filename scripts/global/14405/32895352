<p>What's the easiest way to achieve hover events (in jQuery: <code>element.hover(IN, OUT)</code>) for an area of a specified size around a certain element?</p>  <p>Let's say I have the element X and want the events to trigger when the mouse approaches this element with a distance of 50px from all sides.</p>  <p>Element X is nested complicated in a table, etc. so I cannot use any parent. How could I solve this issue with the element alone or with some nested element?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
