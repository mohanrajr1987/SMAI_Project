<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6910049/on-a-css-hover-event-can-i-change-another-divs-styling">This is my closest answer I can find</a> but I am struggling to implement this with a graphic / navigation I have to do.  I hope you can help.</p>  <p>You can see my fiddle here: <code>https://jsfiddle.net/SteveDavies/nxcw9w4f/</code></p>  <p>I have two parts, the part of the right are 3 menu items.  When I hover over the grey, I want the green and pink to change (opaque).  When I hover over the green, I want the grey and pink to change and when I hover over the pink, I want the green and grey to change.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1FzPl.png" alt=""></p>  <p>AT THE SAME TIME</p>  <p>What ever is opaque  on the menu area will be opaque on the globe.</p>  <p>I need to then get it to work backwards, when I float over the pink area of the globe, the other two areas are greyed out and in the menu area to grey out too.</p>  <p>I hope this makes sense.</p>  <p>I thought about using <code>z-index</code> to layer the 3 parts of the globe but I don't think this will work?</p>  <p>Image of the globe also attached.</p>  <p>Hope you can help!</p>  <p>Steve</p>
