<p>I'm new on this things and I really need help!</p>  <p>I have a split screen with two horizontal images and the idea was to create a pre-selection menu with them. The transition should be ON HOVER, the top image will go down, and the bottom image will go up. How can I do this? Do I need JS or just CSS3? It will work on mobile also?</p>  <p>Thank you for the help.</p>
