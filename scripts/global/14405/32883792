I tried:</p>  <p><a href="http://helplogger.blogspot.com/2012/05/create-rollover-image-effect-change.html" rel="nofollow">http://helplogger.blogspot.com/2012/05/create-rollover-image-effect-change.html</a></p>  <p>But it doesn't work. Here's the </p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/wcmHu/237/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a></p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/TLGeYXo.png" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="#"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/bU0lzac.png" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>On the first image it is a gray and white facbook logo. I want to change when hovered into my 2nd logo, the blue facebook logo. Also as it change image, is it possible to have annimation like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://ariannyceleste.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ariannyceleste.com/</a></p>  <p>Please look at the footer and her social button animation. I want it to be that way. I dunno much about css and designs I work mostly in backends.</p>
