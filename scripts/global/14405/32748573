<p>I am trying to display a controlsfx <code>PopOver</code> only while the mouse hovers over a (small) <code>Label</code> control.  But, I have experienced some trouble.</p>  <p>My first approach was to monitor the <strong>mouse-entered</strong> and <strong>mouse-exited</strong> events, but I don't always receive the mouse-exited event (especially with fast mouse movements, remember my <code>Node</code> is small) which causes the pop-over to remain visible after the mouse has already left.</p>  <p>So, I thought I could set a <strong>timer</strong> on mouse-entered and check the mouse position to see if it was still hovering over the <code>Label</code>, but there does not seem to be any way to get the mouse position except in response to a mouse event!</p>  <p>I looked at the source code for <code>Tooltip</code>, but I do not really want what Tooltip does.  Rather, I want something like the CSS hover effect for the <code>Button</code> control.  Perhaps there is a way to tap into that.</p>
