<p>I want call a WCF method when application exit, but, when I try to run ASP.NET application with this code:</p>  <pre><code>protected override void OnUnload(EventArgs e) {     base.OnUnload(e);      MaChatServer.Service1Client proxy = new MaChatServer.Service1Client();     proxy.RemoveUser(UsernameStatic);     if (proxy.GetAllUsers().Count == 0)     {         proxy.ResetServer();     } } </code></pre>  <p>I see this error page:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. For more information about the error and where it originated in the code, refer to the stack trace. Exception Details: System.ServiceModel.FaultException: The server was unable to process the request two to an internal error. For more information about the error, either turn on IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults (either from ServiceBehaviorAttribute or from the  configuration behavior) on the server in order to send the exception information back to the client, or turn on tracing as per the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK documentation and inspect the server trace logs. </p> </blockquote>
