<p>I'm setting up my first web service using WCF in VB.NET, but have hit a problem.</p>  <p>If I set the function up as a string and return a string, the service works fine - so I'm guessing the service is registered OK.  However, when I change the service to define it as List(Of class) and return a List(Of class) the browser running the calling Javascript returns "Uncaught Exception  is not defined."</p>  <p>Here is the calling javascript:</p>  <pre><code>GetMap.GetRoutePoints(sw.lng(),sw.lat(),ne.lng(),ne.lat(),getRoutePointsCallback)   </code></pre>  <p>and here is the service</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;OperationContract()&gt;   Public Function getRoutePoints(leftLng As Double, bottomLat As Double, rightLng As Double, topLat As Double) As String  Dim allRoutePoints As New List(Of RoutePoint)     'Holds the output list of routepoints  'Get the list of stations to display within the zoom boundary  'Code in here that builds the RoutePoint objects and adds them to the list  Return allRoutePoints    End Function End Class  Public Class RoutePoint    Private pSubRoute As Int32  'Sub Route ID of this route point   Private pSeqID As Int32     'Sequence ID of this route point   Private pLng As Double      'Longitude of this route point   Private pLat As Double      'Latitude of this route point    Public Enum cRoutePointType      Standard      SubRouteEnd      SubRouteJoin    End Enum    Public Property SubRouteID As Int32     'Sub Route ID of this route point     Get       SubRouteID = pSubRoute     End Get     Set(value As Int32)       pSubRoute = value     End Set   End Property    Public Property SeqID As Int32 'Sequence ID of this route point Get   SeqID = pSeqID End Get Set(value As Int32)   pSeqID = value End Set   End Property    Public Property Lng As Double     'Longitude of this route point     Get       Lng = pLng     End Get     Set(value As Double)       pLng = value     End Set       End Property    Public Property Lat As Double     'Latitude of this route point     Get       Lat = pLat     End Get     Set(value As Double)       pLat = value     End Set   End Property    Public Sub New(SeqID As Int32, SubRouteID As Int32, Lat As Double, Lng As Double)     'Constructor     pSeqID = SeqID     pSubRoute = SubRouteID     pLat = Lat     pLng = Lng   End Sub End Class </code></pre>  <p>As I say, if I change the List(Of Routepoint) to String in the function declaration, and return "hello world" then the routine works fine, and I can see the Routepoint objects have been setup OK.  When I return to the code above the javascript doesn't seem to think the GetMap service is even defined - so I'm struggling to see why (I thought it would return a serialised JSON object to the callback Javascript function) - and despite searching for a couple of days now can't find a reason why - perhaps (hopefully) its really obvious.</p>
