<p>I am trying to follow a textbook learning how to create a web-sentric WCF service project. I created the service, and see the corresponding folder under Default Web Site on IIS. I can even browse the folder (localhost/EmployeeService/) and see the contents in the browser. Now I want to make a client, i.e. a simple Console application. When I am trying to add a Service Reference, after I enter the address, I get an error:</p>  <p>There was an error downloading '<a href="http://localhost/EmployeeService/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/EmployeeService/</a>$metadata'. The request failed with HTTP status 404: Not Found. Metadata contains a reference that cannot be resolved: '<a href="http://localhost/EmployeeService/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/EmployeeService/</a>'. The remote server returned an unexpected response: (405) Method Not Allowed. The remote server returned an error: (405) Method Not Allowed.</p>  <p>Could you please explain? I saw some questions about the same error, but could not find a solution for myself.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
