<p>I need to build a webservice that only receives a table name.</p>  <p>I was thinking in doing something like this:</p>  <pre><code>public class Table {     public string field{ get; set; }     public string value{ get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>Because I don't know what table the user is going to request and how many columns they have.</p>  <p>I'm using a WCF web service and I want to retrieve the table in JSON format; so far I have something like this (a table with 3 columns):</p>  <pre><code>[{"field":"ID","value":"124"},{"field":"DES","value":"AValue"},{"field":"CODE","value":"ACode"},{"field":"ID","value":"125"},{"field":"DES","value":"AnotherV"},{"field":"CODE","value":"AnotherCode"}] </code></pre>  <p>As you can see it is difficult to know where a row ends</p>  <p>Is there a way to retrieve the data in a more legible way?</p>
