<p>I have a WebAPI2 REST service that returns all test entities using testentities at the end of the url. A client consuming this web service reported that they were able to consume this method in Postman without issue.  However, when they called this service method from their app, they received the following error:</p>  <p>"XmlHttpRequest cannot load testentites.  The request was redirected to  testentites/, which is disallowed for cross-origin requests that require  preflight."</p>  <p>The client later reported that they were able to get around the error above by simply calling the service method with a trailing "/" on the end but the standard format to get all entities from a rest service method doesn't use the trailing slash.</p>  <p>Any idea what the issue might be in the client app that would cause the app to require putting a trailing "/" at the end of the rest service method?  Or is this a common requirement when calling rest service methods from certain types of applications?</p>
