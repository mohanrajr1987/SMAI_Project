<p>I would just like to enable gzip compression to the following binding.</p>  <p>Here is what I have in my config file currently.</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;netHttpsBinding&gt;     &lt;binding name="MutualCertificateBinding" maxReceivedMessageSize="9223372036854775807" receiveTimeout="00:20:00" sendTimeout="00:20:00" transferMode="Streamed" messageEncoding="Binary"&gt;       &lt;security mode="Transport"&gt;         &lt;transport clientCredentialType="Certificate" /&gt;       &lt;/security&gt;       &lt;webSocketSettings transportUsage="Always" /&gt;     &lt;/binding&gt;   &lt;/netHttpsBinding&gt; </code></pre>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd456789(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">According to MSDN</a> tcp, http, and https in WCF are all capable of compression as of 4.5, I'm on 4.5.2.</p>  <p>Keep in mind I'm actually using a WCF contract with a callback contract so duplex is required.</p>  <p>I'm happy to replace my binding with a custom binding as I control both sides and they are both .net but I've been unable to figure out how to create any custom binding that supports websockets.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</p>
