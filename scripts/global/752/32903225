<p>I create console application with soap service and implement custom binding to modify incoming and outgoing messages.</p>  <p>I create service</p>  <pre><code>public SoapService() {     Uri uri = new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["SoapUri"]);     host = new ServiceHost(this, uri);      HttpTransportBindingElement transport = new HttpTransportBindingElement();     transport.MaxReceivedMessageSize = 100 * 1024 * 1024;      ServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior();     smb.HttpGetEnabled = true;     smb.HttpGetUrl = uri;      host.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);     host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ISoapService), new CustomBinding(new GzipBinding(), transport), "");     host.Open(); } </code></pre>  <p>my custom binding is GzipBinding.</p>  <p>On client side I also want to use this binding. Code of creation client object:</p>  <pre><code>CustomBinding binding = new CustomBinding(new GzipBinding(), new HttpTransportBindingElement()); EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["RemoteSoapServer"]);  var soapClient = new ServiceReference.SoapServiceClient(binding, address))  soapClient.Upload(new file()); </code></pre>  <p>Problem is that then i create soap service overriden methods of GzipBinding are called as should, but on client side methods not called, and as I think my binding not used so finally I get exception about MessageVesrison mismatch. More - my client not trying connect to remote host it throw error then trying call method Upload. Any help pls.</p>
