<p>We are executing powershell scripts for exchange online using c#. We created WCF services for executing different commands and calling that services. While doing login we are accepting credentials of user's office 365 account. And stores the user information in WSConnectionInfo class</p>  <pre><code>WSManConnectionInfo connectionInformation = "some user connection information" connectionInformation  = new WSManConnectionInfo (new Uri("https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/"),                    "http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/Microsoft.Exchange",                        new PSCredential(logedInUserName, GetPassword(logedInUserPassword)));                 using(Runspace runspace=RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(connectionInformation))     {                        using (PowerShell powershell = PowerShell.Create())    {         //  code for executing powershell command    } } </code></pre>  <p>So all the information about connection is stored in ConnectionInformation object. Whenever I executes the commands, I send ConnectionInformation object to runspace. Relevant data of user's account get displayed mailboxes, distribution groups etc.  Now the problem is that, whenever we does the login for single user, it is working fine. But if we do login for  multiple users at a time, it stores the credentials for latest logged in user and all operations gets executed for the  account of that user. We want to maintain the different sessions for different users. How to do this? </p>  <h2><strong>NOTE: I am using WCF RESTFull services and I have written all C# code in WCF and fetching that functions by AJAX</strong></h2>  <p>Thanks in Advance</p>
