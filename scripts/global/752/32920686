<p>When i send test IPN by "Instant Payment Notification (IPN) Simulator" i get this: "IPN was not sent, and the handshake was not verified. Please review your information." In this case no reaction on the server is not happening :( What am I doing wrong? P.S. My server accessible from the Internet and nothing is blocking access. I asked a friend to send me a test message with Post request and my server accepted it. But on PayPal my method does not react at all!</p>  <pre><code>[ServiceContract] public interface IPayPalService {    [OperationContract]    [WebInvoke(Method = "POST", UriTemplate = "/")]    void Notify(Stream data); }  public void Notify(Stream data) { }  &lt;service name="PayPal.PayPalService"&gt;    &lt;endpoint address="http://myip:myport/PayPalService"              binding="webHttpBinding"              contract="PayPal.IPayPalService"/&gt; &lt;/service&gt; </code></pre>
