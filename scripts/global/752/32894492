<p>In my project wcf service application is developed fat interface i.e interface is containing more than 500+ methods and so it is taking lot of time to debug the service, if i am trying to split the service into multiple services the risk factor is more because we need to change the lot of code in CLIENT application also so can anyone pls suggest me the feasible way to overcome this.</p>
