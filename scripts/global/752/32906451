<p>I have framed a JSONP data consumable "Rest" Web Service. The functionality is, the web page based on a CMS would send us JSON Data using JSONP to our REST Web Service. </p>  <p>The REST Web Service is targeting 3.5 .NET Framework and hence we have to do a lot of custom bindings etc but a MSDN website code helped me.</p>  <p>I tested the service by sending data in URL query string myself, it looks good. Now, we are in a situation to host this service in a secured server using HTTPS environment).</p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>Will this service support HTTPS? Or if it doesn't, then what is that I need to do? </p>
