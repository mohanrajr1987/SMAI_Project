<p>I'm consuming a third-party's web service with WCF. I've got a PFX certificate file that I'm attaching via the <code>ClientCredentials.ClientCertificate.SetCertificate</code> method. I'm using the "Message Security Version" <code>WSSecurity10WSTrustFebruary2005WSSecureConversationFebruary2005WSSecurityPolicy11BasicSecurityProfile10</code>.</p>  <p>Everything works fine. Now the third-party's certificate is expiring so they've issued a new one. However, this time it's a P7B file with just the public key.</p>  <p>When I try to use this certificate, I get a <code>NotSupportedException</code> with the message "The private key is not present in the X.509 certificate."</p>  <p>No part of my code is supplying the private key password, so I'm assuming this means that the private key is not being used. If this is the case, how can I consume this web service using only the public key? Or have I misunderstood something? (very likely)</p>
