<p>I would like to discuss the general theory (with example if helpful) of password encrypting PDFs so they can be decrypted in Reader, Acrobat, etc.  I have to do this WITHOUT iText or it's like because I doubt I can get permission from my bosses.</p>  <p>I am at a loss how to go about it, I have some knowledge of PDF structure (Streams, objects, filters).  But I am at a loss of where to begin.</p>  <p>For example, using AES-128, do I have to maintain objects and streams (only encrypting contents), or can I just encrypt the entire thing and just add a clear text filter showing which encryption type?</p>  <p>I would like just to use a few lines in iText, but I cannot.</p>
