<p>I created the following class, based from the examples on MSDN: <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/19d9e5f6747dfe75d553" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/19d9e5f6747dfe75d553</a></p>  <p>Whenever I use it like this, it seems like it encrypts fine:</p>  <pre><code>var key = Crypto.GenerateKey(); var vector = Crypto.GenerateVector(key);  var cypherText = Crypto.EncryptBase64("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890", key, vector); vector = Crypto.GenerateVector(key); var plainText = Crypto.Decrypt(cypherText, key, vector); </code></pre>  <p>Then <code>plainText</code> contains the following:</p>  <p><code>�\aU��(���P\u0003�b\u001dxqrstuvwxyz1234567890</code></p>  <p>So it seems changing the IV, doesn't really do anything (especially on longer documents). Why do we even need an IV?</p>
