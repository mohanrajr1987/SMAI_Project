<p>In a ceasar cipher I need it to be that my upper characters remain upper and that non letter character remain non letters/the same. I have it that I can work with lower letters.</p>  <p>Upper letters however are converted to lower and a different letter. Non-letter characters are converted to a lower letter as well. Upper letters must shift but remain upper. Non-letter characters must remain as non-letter character.</p>  <pre><code>p = raw_input(("enter a word")) n = input(("how many must it shift")) a = 0 b = 0 c = 0 d = 0  for i in p: if i.isupper():     a += 1 elif i.islower():     b += 1 elif i.isdigit():     c += 1 else:     d += 1 e = ""  for i in p:     if i == "":     e += i else:     integerValue = ord(i)     integerValue-= 97     integerValue += n     integerValue %= 26     integerValue += 97     e += chr(integerValue)      print e </code></pre>
