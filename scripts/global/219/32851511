<p>I have a site set up which takes data from a form and encrypts it using libsodium for php. Due to something that happened on the server, somehow the CRYPTO_BOX_NONCEBYTES variable returned 64 instead of 24. We now have several files that are encrypted with libsodium using a nonce size of 64, and we also have the relating nonce files. Is there any way to decrypt this?</p>  <p>In other words, I have a file that has been encrypted with a 64-bit nonce. When I try to decrypt it with that same 64-bit nonce, it fails with the following error:</p>  <pre><code>PHP Fatal error:  crypto_box_open(): nonce size should be CRYPTO_BOX_NONCEBYTES long in /data/www/docroot/filename.php on line 42 </code></pre>
