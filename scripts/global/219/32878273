<p>I wrote a customized Liferay login portlet for Liferay 6.2 and I need to compare the password provided by the user with his password in the database, which is encrypted or hashed.</p>  <p>How can I encrypt the given password to compare it to the password in the database? I tried <code>Encryptor.encrypt(company.getKeyObj(), password)</code>, however it does not give the same encryption, encryption looks like this: <code>AAAAoAAB9AAIOq5P5Lf2Ip2RoV3MynhtkU6s++nPknsVblKR</code>. </p>
