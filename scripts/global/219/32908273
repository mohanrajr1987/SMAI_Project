<p>My LAMP website captures data including Credit Card details. I want to encrypt this data, attach it to an email to myself, and open it in Thunderbird.  There  I want to be able to decrypt and detach the data for use in MYOB.</p>  <p>I've had some success using mCrypt to encrypt a text file, attach it to an email and send it.  I've installed Enigmail in Thunderbird, but cannot work out how to decrypt the attachment. </p>  <p>I can create Private/Public keys sing EnigMail/GnuPG, but cannot use the 3000+ character Public Key as the $key in mCrypt (too long - Max appears to be 56ish chars). </p>  <p>My knowledge in this area is weak, so I'm floundering around with arguments for mCrypt, and configuring EnigMail/GnuPG.  So...</p>  <ol> <li><p>Am I dreaming, or can I use matching arguments in mCrypt that EnigMail will be able to decrypt?</p></li> <li><p>Do I have to install some form of GnuPG (which is used by EnigMail) onto the Webserver (PHP, Apache, or operating system) that enables use of a $key that makes sense within mCrypt?</p></li> <li><p>Is the use of short key strings for $key in mCrypt basically just so decryption can be done within the same environment using the same string as the decryption $key?</p></li> <li><p>Is there a better way of sending secure data from a PHP environment to an email address as an attachment?</p></li> </ol>
