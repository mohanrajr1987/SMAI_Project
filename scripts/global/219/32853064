<p>I have an assignment which requires me to encrypt a users message with a keyword. I need it to be able to leave spaces numbers and special characters alone. If i could add an <code>isalpha</code> function within my code it would work effectively.</p>  <p>This is the code I have so far</p>  <pre><code>newmessage=('') message=raw_input('inputmessage')  while True:     mode=raw_input('what is mode')     if mode==('e') or mode==('d'):        break  while True:     keyword=raw_input('what is keyword')     if keyword.isalpha()==True:        break n, m = len(keyword), len(message)  newkeyword=''.join( [ keyword[ i % n ]  for i in range(m) ] )  alphabet='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'  message=message.lower()  message = zip(message, newkeyword)  for letters in message:     positions = [(alphabet.find(m), alphabet.find(n)) for m, n in message] if mode==('e'):     sums = [alphabet.find(m) + alphabet.find(n) for m, n in message] else:     sums = [alphabet.find(m) - alphabet.find(n) for m, n in message] for i in sums:     i%=26     newmessage+=alphabet[i+1] print newmessage </code></pre>  <p>I need to check if letters are alphanumeric and then add them on at end if their not. Where do I put the <code>isalpha</code> function?</p>  <h3>Example</h3>  <p>If the message was 'hello6' and mode was 'e' and keyword was 'abc' the expected outcome would be 'igomq6', but this code will encrypt '6' giving me somthing like 'igomqc'.</p>
