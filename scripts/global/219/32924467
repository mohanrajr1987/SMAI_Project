<p>I am trying to decrypt three files as "test" for joining to a programming enterprise. The first one was relatively easy, since it was coded in base64. The other files are encrypted. However, the text of the desencrypted file said that the following will be encrypted with one of the simplest coding methods, but I would need to find the key (??). </p>  <p>I do not have any idea what method (DES?) could be or where is the key located (they have a server but I had not seen any suspicious file or something). </p>  <p>Can anyone give me some ideas about the possible encryption methods and where to find the key? Maybe trying a BruteForce attack will be a good idea? Thank you.</p>  <p>EDIT: Files can be obtained following this link: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xuk66eq7r2u0j76/encryptedfiles.tar.gz?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Files</a></p>
