<p>Is there any way to decrypt a volume that's been encrypted using a "standard" or commonly used volume encryption system (such as LUKS) using multiple passphrases? I've been searching for something that could do it, but haven't found anything indicating it's possible. </p>  <p>If there isn't a way of doing this natively with LUKS, I'm wondering if anyone has tried to build a custom way of doing it - possibly storing the volume decryption key / passphrase in an encrypted file that can be decrypted by multiple users (e.g. <code>gpg --encrypt --recipient user1 --recipient user2 luks-passphrase.txt</code>) - how would one go about about automating prompts to decrypt on boot?</p>  <p>Brief background on the use-case: I want to configure a workstation that a number of users can log on to. <code>/home</code> is to be encrypted, but I don't want to use a shared key to distribute between users - each user should be able to boot and log into the system using private, non-shared credentials. </p>  <p>If LUKS won't work, then I'd look at <a href="http://patrick.uiterwijk.org/2013/02/25/gpg-encrypted-loopback-disks/" rel="nofollow">http://patrick.uiterwijk.org/2013/02/25/gpg-encrypted-loopback-disks/</a> as an alternative system.</p>
