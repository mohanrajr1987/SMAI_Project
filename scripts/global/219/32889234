<p>What I want to do is to create a mail attachment from a string file and give it my own custom extension.</p>  <pre><code>    public void CreateAttachment(string encryptedString, string fileName)     {         mail.Attachments.Add(Attachment.CreateAttachmentFromString(encryptedString, fileName));     } </code></pre>  <p>I want to create a ".bzk" file and it's gonna be opened in a mobile Android application later. How do I do this? I know there are different constructors as you can see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.attachment(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">here!</a></p>  <p>I do not know what constructors I have to use and even after trying different MIME types and Encodings, it won't work. Can anyone tell me how to do this?</p>
