<p>I have ran a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination" rel="nofollow">Kasiski Examination</a> on a cipher text file, which was created through the use of a modified Vigenere cipher. Something like a polyalphabetic cipher that focuses on swapping sub-bits of each character, key and plain, to get cipher character.</p>  <p>I am quite confident I know the key length, but the length is far too long to brute force all possibilities. Also, the decoded file it not plaintext ASCII but some sort of binary word processing file (PDF, DOC, etc)</p>  <p>I have found the <a href="https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic" rel="nofollow">python-magic</a> which can identify files by their header (I think?) but that would still require brute forcing at least a few lines, if not the whole file, saving it, then testing the file to see if it is a proper type.</p>  <p>Any suggestions on how to recognize the output is a proper file type? Or, better yet, a way to not have to brute force?</p>
