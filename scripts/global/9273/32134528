<p>So I have a fairly simple RSS that I'm downloading and then deserializing using XmlSerializer.  For some odd reason that I cannot figure out nor after reporting the issue the owner of the RSS hasn't fixed after months.</p>  <p>This is the malformed item in the RSS:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;item&gt;     &lt;guid isPermaLink="false"&gt;TopicID_441307&lt;/guid&gt;     &lt;link&gt;https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;amp;t=441307&lt;/link&gt;     &lt;author&gt;Malycia Kiss&lt;/author&gt;     &lt;title&gt;WTB Freighter / JF Pilot with PI&lt;/title&gt;     &lt;description&gt;&amp;lt;a href=https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;amp;m=5976122#post5976122 &amp;gt;Go to last post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gtgt; by&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;a10:updated&gt;2015-08-18T17:33:40Z&lt;/a10:updated&gt; &lt;/item&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The malformed section is in the description element due to the &amp;gtgt, which is just supposed to be &amp;gt - again, I have no idea why their RSS puts the extra characters there.</p>  <p>When deserializing, I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>Unexpected node type EntityReference. ReadElementString method can only be called on elements with simple or empty content. Line 3231, position 130. </code></pre>  <p>The questions!</p>  <ol> <li><p>If those sanitized characters are contained within a proper element , why does it care if there is a malformed URL encoded string?</p></li> <li><p>Is this because the XmlSerializer is trying to revert these encoded values back to their original character?</p></li> <li><p>What is the best way to handle this?  Keep in mind that I've only ever run into this type of issue once or twice on each RSS feed and only for &amp;gt and &amp;lt encodings - so maybe just a simple find/replace?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Sorry if I used the wrong terms when explaining this.  </p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
