<p>I have a <code>DataContractSerializer</code> which uses an <code>XMLWriter</code>. By default the encoding for this is UTF8. I am working with DICOM data here. I serialize some header attributes from DICOM file. There is a patient with name in Japanese characters. </p>  <p>If the encoding for my input data in attribute<code>SpecialCharacterSet</code> <code>(0008,0005)</code> is set to ISO IR 100 then my serializer throws an exception. However, if I create the input data with ISO 2022 IR 87 then it serializes the data. </p>  <p>I would like to know whether ISO 2022 IR is a subset of UTF8 and ISO IR 100 is not?</p>  <p>Should I blindly create <code>XMLWriter</code> with <code>Unicode</code> encoding?</p>  <p>Thanks for help!</p>
