<p>So, I have a problem: text that I would like to read is stored in .xml file, but it contains parameters marked <code>$PARAMETER_NAME$</code> (f.e. <code>$UserName$</code>).</p>  <p>I also have <code>Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code> which contains all of the required key/value pairs. I would like to deserialize the xml file, but I need to replace parameters with corresponding values. The only solution I've came up with was to read the whole file and replace each value, but this approach consumes TOO much memory and is quite childish</p>  <p>Can I somehow override FileStream's <code>Read()</code> method to replace the values on-read?</p>
