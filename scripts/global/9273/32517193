<p>Does anyone know good library to serialize and deserialize XML in Android?</p>  <p>I'm looking for library which allows to define classes and then serialize it to XML or create object from XML.</p>  <p>The perfect one should be very similar to GSON / Jackson for JSON files. </p>  <p>XmlPullParser is definitely not what I'm looking for.</p>  <p>I found one almost perfect (<a href="https://github.com/stanfy/gson-xml" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/stanfy/gson-xml</a>) but it doesn't allow to serialize objects.</p>
