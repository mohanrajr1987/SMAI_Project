<p>Is it possible to mix the .net framework serialization in xml with some handmade serialization method ? </p>  <p>I have a "sealed" class <code>Outline</code> which contains a method <code>WriteToXml()</code> that I would like to use. </p>  <p>More difficult, I have another class which contains : </p>  <pre><code>class Difficult {      [XmlElement("Point", typeof(Point))]     [XmlElement("Contour", typeof(Outline))]     [XmlElement("Curve", typeof(Curve))]     public object Item; } </code></pre>  <p>It corresponds to a xsi:choice. </p>  <p><code>Curve</code> and <code>Point</code> should be serialized using the standard method, and I would like to tell the serializer to use <code>WriteToXml()</code> when <code>Item</code> is an <code>Outline</code>. </p>
