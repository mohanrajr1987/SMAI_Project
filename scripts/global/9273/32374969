<p>I am using XmlSerializer to serialize Objects to XML. In that I have used attribute <code>IsNullable =  true</code> for getting the element in the XML even if the value is null.</p>  <p>So When the values is <code>NULL</code>, its corresponding element is visible but with the extra attribute <code>xsi:nil="true"</code>. </p>  <p>Is there a way to remove that attribute in the serialized XML?</p>
