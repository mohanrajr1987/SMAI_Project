<p>I've a question about the libgdx Skin behavior. the game I'm developing has a global AssetsManager (from the libgdx suite) that every class can access. I load different TextureAtlas inside this assets manage I know that assetManager.dispose() disposes all the resources loaded inside the assets manager.</p>  <p>Now, I would like also to have a Skin (for the GUI) loaded inside the assets manager. The skin is gonna use several TextureAtlas...</p>  <p>Here's the question: since I'm gonna use skin.addRegion() and since the online API reference about the skin class says "The atlas will not be automatically disposed when the skin is disposed" is it a good idea to load all the TextureAtlasof the skin in the global assets manager?</p>  <p>I'm fearing about the dispose action. Because when I call the assetManager.dispose() both the TextureAtlas and the Skin will be called on the dispose method...but what if the TextureAtlas are disposed before the skin? Could actually happen any problem about it?</p>  <p>The skin behavior is not so well-defined, I mean...what does the dispose method do?</p>  <p>Thank in advance,</p>  <p>Luca</p>
