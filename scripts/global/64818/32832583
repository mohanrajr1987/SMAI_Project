<p>I'm trying to achieve a circular movement around another body. Since now I have a <code>DistanceJoint</code> between the two bodies but my problem is how to find the right direction where to apply my force.</p>  <p>I tryied this function which is obviously not working:</p>  <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code> public void updateCircular(float speed, Vector2 center){     Vector2 radius = center.sub(this.body.getPosition());     Vector2 force = radius.rotate90(1).nor().scl(speed);     this.body.setLinearVelocity(force.x, force.y); } </code></pre>  <p><code>center</code> is the anchor point of my static body and the function is called by the class of my moving body, actually the idea was to call this method in the render part so every time I'd have rotated the vector of the distance between the two bodies of 90 degree to find the tangent vector. </p>  <p>It seems to be a bad idea, so how can I find the tangent vector in every frame in order to move my first object around the second one?</p>
