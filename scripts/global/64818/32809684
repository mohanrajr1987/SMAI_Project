<p>I am trying to implement licensing into my Libgdx project. I have created a new project using the licensing from the android SDK. As libgdx creates multiple projects(core, android,ios etc.) and all of the source code is stored in the core project. I cant link the licensing project to the core project (right click -> android) as the android option is not available as core is not an android project. So i linked it to the android project but i get errors making me assume this doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>LicenceCheckerCallback cannot be resolved to a type </code></pre>  <p>imports not being found etc.</p>
