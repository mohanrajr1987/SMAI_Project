<p>I have an issue trying to get the facebook sdk for android linked to my libgdx/android project, I have added the dependency to the grade.build file and ran build, the facebook sdk shows up in the gradle dependencies but no class files are present.</p>  <p>This is where I have added the dependency in the build file, hopefully someone is familiar with the rest of the file from libgdx experience:</p>  <pre><code>project(":android") { apply plugin: "android"  configurations { natives }  dependencies {     compile project(":core")     compile "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-android:$gdxVersion"     natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi"     natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi-v7a"     natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-x86"     compile "com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:$ashleyVersion"     compile "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-ai:$aiVersion"     compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:4.6.0'  } } </code></pre>  <p>Here is a screenshot of the dependencies file structure in eclipse, as you can see it's not a jar, not sure what to do here.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sqJq8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sqJq8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
