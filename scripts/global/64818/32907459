<p>I had a perfectly running game and it didn't crash on any phones I tested it on . It still runs fine (constant 60FPS) on all of them except on my S4 which I had recently updated to Android 5.0.1. The game worked perfectly before the update but now, after playing 7-10 minutes, and after multiple level restarts, it just freezes suddenly (no FPS drops before or after) and then un-freezes after a few seconds; also, the background music is not playing anymore. </p>  <p>I get a <code>A/libc: Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -6 in tid 32410 (Binder_1)</code> error , only on this phone. </p>  <p>What could be the issue here?  I have the latest update installed on the device.</p>  <p>I use the Libgdx 1.6.0 framework for the game.</p>  <p>Here's a video of the <a href="https://youtu.be/OV0Ad2xuQTw?t=202" rel="nofollow">freeze</a> and then the <a href="https://youtu.be/OV0Ad2xuQTw?t=250" rel="nofollow">Logcat</a> of the error.</p>
