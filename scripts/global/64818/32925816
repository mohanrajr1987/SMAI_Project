<p>I compiled simple task and got 1m 21s 737ms. It is much much slower than using Eclipse only take 2-5 seconds.</p>  <p>How do I make it faster like just 2-5 seconds? or at least make it faster.</p>  <p>I tried run <code>gradlew idea</code> and load project with *.ipr file, but when I compiled it still called <code>gradle</code> command which result slow build process.</p>  <p>Is it possible to disable <code>gradle</code> and make like regular <code>Android Studio</code>/<code>Intellij IDEA</code> project?</p>  <p>I tried using --offline or daemon but still slow.</p>  <p>I tried run <code>gradlew desktop:run</code> from command line and it takes 1 minutes 7 seconds.</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>Trying simple task:</p>  <pre><code>task hello {     doLast {         println 'Hello world!'     } } </code></pre>  <p>I read from <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> example 6.1</p>  <p>When I run it. It takes 1m 2s. Why simple task like that takes so much time? </p>  <p>Do I miss something about install gradle?</p>  <p>I use Gradle 2.6.</p>
