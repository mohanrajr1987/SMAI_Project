<p>I simply want to draw background, overlay it with 0.5f transparent black color to dim it and render on top of that a pause menu.</p>  <p>I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>    Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0f, 0f, 0f, 0.5f);     Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); </code></pre>  <p>and nothing is working. I also couldn't find any solution online. My other option is to overlay a black sprite, but I don't want to do that. Is there anyway to paint it over with GL?</p>
