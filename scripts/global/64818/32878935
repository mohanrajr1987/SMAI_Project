<p>Is it worth it to enable blending directly before something that needs it and disable it right after or is it better to just keep it enabled the whole way through? The reason why this question came up is that the documentation for disable/enableBlending() says: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Disables blending for drawing sprites. Calling this within   begin()/end() will flush the batch.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As far as I am aware flushing can have a performance impact if done very often in one frame. I would be very happy if someone could clarify which is the better option.</p>
