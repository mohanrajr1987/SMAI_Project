<p>I'm looking for some up to date tutorial for AppWarp libGDX integration. I think, this is a bit deprecated: <a href="http://appwarp.shephertz.com/game-development-center/java-multiplayer-libgdx-tutorial" rel="nofollow">http://appwarp.shephertz.com/game-development-center/java-multiplayer-libgdx-tutorial</a></p>  <p>I know the basic concepts, that I need <code>AppWarp client</code> and three other adapters and already have created an app and a room in <code>App42 Management Console</code>, but don't know how to import <code>AppWarp SDK</code> to Android Studio. I have a perfectly working single player application, but get stuck in details and integration process.</p>
