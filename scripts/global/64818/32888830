<p>There is an image of musical instrument at the screen of my app. I want to play one note of predefined midi file when the image is touched. So if you touch the image continuously, you can hear some nice music.</p>  <p>The Music and Sound classes of LibGDX do not allow  to play midi files note by note. Timer is not an option because duration of notes may vary.</p>  <p>So, how to play single notes from midi file in LibGDX?</p>
