<p>I have 2 plugins registered on the same pipeline stage (post operation) and triggers on the same entity <strong>Entity A</strong> (create event).</p>  <p>When plugin 1 triggers on <strong>Entity A</strong> (create event) and make changes to <strong>Entity B</strong> and another plugin 2 triggers on <strong>Entity A</strong> (create event) and make while making changes to  <strong>Entity A</strong> an exception was thrown.</p>  <p>Does the changes that plugin 1 made on <strong>Entity B</strong> get rolled back since both plugins triggers on the same entity and they have the same pipeline stage OR the changes plugin 1 made to <strong>Entity B</strong> remain and will not be rolled back?</p>
