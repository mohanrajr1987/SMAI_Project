<p>I have an entity which has around 15 fields on it. When users download the data import template,  all the 15 fields are included and displayed in Excel (as expected). </p>  <p>I would like to hide/exclude some of these fields as they are only populated  at a later stage. I believe CRM uses the main form of the entity to create the template (I stand corrected on this). </p>  <p>Is there a way to generate the template based on another form? or achieve the above with some work around?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I could not completely achieve what I wanted, but implemented a work around. I ended up exporting the template, removing columns I wanted to hide from the user and then placing the new template in a central location for copying and importing.</p>
