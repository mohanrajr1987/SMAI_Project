<p>I need to make a generic exporter/importer from a Microsoft CRM 2011 system and I cant find out if a LookupAttribute is a one-to-one- or one-to-many-relation.</p>  <p>E.x.  I have an Entity called an "E-mail".</p>  <p>And e-mail can have one "From" (which is a lookup attribute that does its lookup into multiple other Entity-lists)</p>  <p>It can then have multiple "To" (also referencing out into multiple entity-lists as a lookup attribute).</p>  <p>The conclusions I just made are stuff that i figured out by using the web portal for MS CRM. I just cant find any way to see in the metadata of these Entities or Attributes if its a one-to-one- or a on-to-many-relation.</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg509035.aspx#BKMK_CreateLookupAttribute" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg509035.aspx#BKMK_CreateLookupAttribute</a></p>  <p>I've looked at this example on how to create these kinds of relations, but it hasnt gotten me any futher.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any experience with generic export/import with MS CRM 2011 that can help me?</p>
