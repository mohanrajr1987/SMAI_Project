<p>I am creating an import / export tool for CRM using C#. Sometimes, I am facing to an import error, with only this message "Solution manifest import: FAILURE" in my catch. I tried to cast it to its type (FaultException), but I haven't any more details.</p>  <p>If I do the import of the same file directly in CRM, I have a better error message (this one for exemple : "Import of solution xxxx failed. The following components are missing in yout system [...]").</p>  <p>Is there a way to get this complete message ?</p>  <p>Here is my code :</p>  <pre><code>try {     _serviceProxy.Execute(impSolReq); } catch (Exception ex) {     if (ex is FaultException&lt;OrganizationServiceFault&gt;)         MessageBox.Show("Error during import. More details: " + ((FaultException&lt;OrganizationServiceFault&gt;)ex).Detail);     else         MessageBox.Show("Error during import. More details: " + ex.Message); } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for your answers !</p>
