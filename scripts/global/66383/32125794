<p>I want to count <code>Status Reason</code> on <code>Case</code> entity. But I don't know how to group by as shown bellow. I was looking around but couldn't find anything useful.</p>  <pre><code>------------------------------------ ALIAS       | STATUS REASON ------------------------------------ Open        | New ------------------------------------ In progress | In Progress ------------------------------------             | Problem solved Closed      | No customer response             | Merged             | Canceled ------------------------------------ </code></pre>  <p>There are some more <code>Status Reason</code> values, which I don't want to count.</p>  <p>Is this even possible?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
