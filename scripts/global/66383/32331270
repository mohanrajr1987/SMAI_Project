<p>I have to prepare the project for crm 2011's Update RollUp 18. From what I understand, from now onward the Micrososft.CRM.SDK dll is not supported anymore, thus I have removed it from my project. As one would expect, a lot of "<em>could not be found</em>" errors appeared because of the removal. For the code bellow, I have ".. Property could not be found.." and "..StringProperty could not be found .." .</p>  <pre><code>   public class ExtMergeName : ExtPropertyBase, ICrmString     {         public Property GetValue()         {             return CrmStringObject;         }          public StringProperty CrmStringObject         {             get             {                 return (StringProperty)ReturnStringProperty();             }         } </code></pre>  <p>What can I replace them with?</p>
