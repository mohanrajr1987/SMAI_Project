<p>I'm using the following gem to connect to Microsoft Dyanmics CRM: <a href="https://github.com/TinderBox/dynamics_crm">https://github.com/TinderBox/dynamics_crm</a>. I was able to connect and add contacts, leads and a few other things just fine. My problem is, I can't figure out how to add an order and order details. Here is the code I am using to create an order detail:</p>  <pre><code>details = Hash.new     details = {         'quantity' =&gt; 1000.0,         'productid' =&gt; product,         'salesorderid' =&gt; DynamicsCRM::XML::EntityReference.new("salesorder", order.id),         'uomid' =&gt; DynamicsCRM::XML::EntityReference.new("uom", 'F5AE673D-5D8E-E211-8AD0-78E3B5101E8F'),         'createdon' =&gt; Time.now.getutc,         'salesorderstatecode' =&gt; 1,         'description' =&gt; 'This is just a test order',     }     orderDetail = client.create('salesorderdetail', details) </code></pre>  <p>This runs fine, but when I check in the CRM backend, there is no record under Order Details. I also can't figure out how to send custom fields, I have tried 'new_shirtsize' => 'XL', but I just get an error that the field 'new_shirtsize' doesn't exist for the entity 'salesorderdetail'.</p>
