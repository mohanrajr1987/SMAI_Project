<p>I am attempting to eliminate the issue of Security Roles being dropped when changing a User's Business Unit in CRM 2011.  I have taken a few approaches with varying degrees of success, but none provide a seamless solution. So far a combination of plugins seems to be the best way.   </p>  <p>The challenge is this: The Security Roles are dropped after the pre-validation stage, but before the pre-operation stage.  I am able to capture the user's security roles in the original Business Unit when I register my plugin on the pre-validation stage if I execute an update other than changing the Business Unit, but the pre-validation plugin does not get triggered when running a Change Business Unit Update (the first stage that occurs is pre-operation).  I need to execute the pre-validation plugin when updating the user's Business Unit.  Once I get the name of the security role, I can store it in the PluginExecutionContext shared variables, then in my post-stage event plugin, I can query for the new security role with the correct name that is associated with my new Business Unit (that part of the code is working).  </p>  <p>Has anyone either figured out how to: </p>  <p>a) transfer a user's security roles from the original BU to a new one (using plugins or not)</p>  <p>OR </p>  <p>b) trigger a plugin registered on the pre-validation stage for a Change User's Business Unit action</p>
