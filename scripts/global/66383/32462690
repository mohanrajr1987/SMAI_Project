<p>I have added companies and contacts to 2011 Dynamic CRM online. The contacts are tied back to the company. However, I want to create a workflow that allows me to update the company and add a primary contact to the company record whenever the contact full name is present in the active contact list under the company form. Any suggestions? </p>
