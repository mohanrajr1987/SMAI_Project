<p>Sometimes I need to delete a duplicate record in CRM that has associations. In these cases I have to reassign these associations. The related entities menu allows me to check, one by one, whether the record has associations in any of the entities to which it is related. This forces me to scan through many related entities. Is there a quicker way to view all associations for a record?</p>
