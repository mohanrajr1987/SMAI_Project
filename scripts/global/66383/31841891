<p>I have enabled Field security on 2 checkboxes I have on a my form.</p>  <p>Checkboxes: Security Override (checkbox) Financial Overide (checkbox)</p>  <p>I have created 2 Field Security Profiles (FSP).</p>  <p>Override Control</p>  <p>This FSP will grant assigned users the ability to read, create, update.</p>  <p>Override Read</p>  <p>This FSP will grant assigned users the ability to read.</p>  <p>When I tested Override Read with an assigned user. I was still able to click and changed the checkboxes. It appears as if crm is ignoring the Override Read FSP.</p>  <p>How can I configure the checkboxes to be read only using Field Security Profiles?</p>
