<p>Using <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn647420.aspx" rel="nofollow">a powershell script to deploy a CRM Package</a> works well, but I am running into some unexpected behavior.</p>  <p>The package has 1 unmanaged solution that it uploads. It works perfectly if the solution does not exist on the target CRM organization. However, if the solution does already exist on the organization and I try to deploy it again with some changes, it will not work. The changes are not uploaded and I do not get any errors.</p>  <p>If I change the version number in the solution (from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2, for example) then uploading it works as expected. </p>  <p>I would rather not change the version every time though, and since manually uploading an unmanaged solution with the same version number works perfectly I would expect the script to be able to do it as well.</p>
