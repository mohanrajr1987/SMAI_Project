<p>Out of the blue one of our users started experiencing JScript errors when using the Outlook client for MS Dynamics CRM 2011. We are on Rollup 14, for both the client and the server itself, but upgrading them both to 18 did not resolve the issue. I've tried emptying temporary files, deleting caches, and adding our server to the IE trusted sites list, but nothing has fixed it. I've tried clean installations of Outlook and the client itself. </p>  <p>The problem occurs when trying to 'Set Regarding' from the Outlook client. The error messages begin immediately and say 'Script Error', usually something about XPathEvaluator. </p>  <p>If I click through the prompts, the search box is non-functioning and the 'Search' preview text does not go away. I don't know anything about how to trace with 'debugger'. Has anyone else encountered this or a similar error?</p>
