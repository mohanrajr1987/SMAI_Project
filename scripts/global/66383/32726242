<p>I'm trying to create a MS CRM Dynamics 2011 plugin that shares views in a dashboard when the dashboard is shared with users. Right now, when we share a dashboard, users cannot see the views because the views have not been shared as well. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Aieix.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Aieix.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I know how to share records with code, but I'm not sure how to hook my plugin to a dashboard share event. Normally I use the Plugin Registration Tool and specify an entity and CRUD operation required to kick off my plugin:  </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fd1FA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fd1FA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But because Dashboards are not entities (Contact, Account, etc.), I'm not sure how to fire my plugin during sharing. Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
