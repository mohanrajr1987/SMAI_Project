<p>I call the same custom CodeActivity a number of times in a workflow with different input parameters, and then follow each call with a Check Condition step against the output parameters.</p>  <p>The problem is there is nothing in the UI to distinguish between the calls. At the moment I just keep selecting the last on in the drop down under Local Values hoping that was the most recent call.</p>  <p>Is there someway to override what the UI shows, e.g. a property of the CodeActivity I can override to include the value of an input parameter. I've been through the reference page and nothing specifically claims to do this. Normally I would just play around to see what happens but not being that familiar with CRM I'm afraid I'm going to break something big time.</p>
