<p>I am trying to disable the setting in the CRM for Outlook client that automatically creates a Contact if one doesn't already exist. This can be changed in the settings screen on the client machine. However, I have many hundreds of machines to change and cannot find a policy or script that would accomplish this.</p>  <p>Is there any supported way to change this setting in bulk (powershell, script)? If it is a registry modification, does anyone know where this information is kept?</p>  <p>Thanks for any pointers,</p>
