<p>I am trying to create a portal where we can access the records in crm. This portal will be hosted outside the CRM as a web application and not as a web resource in crm.</p>  <p>In one of the pages i like to show the out of the box  crm view. So i used a html page with an iframe in it .i specified the source of the iframe to crm view  below is my iframe code</p>  <p></p>  <p>Now when i open this html page directly via my web application the iframe i am getting the below error</p>  <p>"This content can’t be shown in a frame</p>  <p>There is supposed to be some content here, but the publisher doesn’t allow it to be displayed in a frame. This is to help protect the security of any information you might enter into this site.</p>  <p>Try this</p>  <p>Open this in a new window</p>  <p>"</p>  <p>But if i create a web resource in crm with the same html page i can see the view with no issues.</p>  <p>If i paste the below url directly in the browser i can also see the view</p>  <p><a href="http://xrmdroid:5555/XRMfinsights/main.aspx?etn=opportunity&amp;pagetype=entitylist&amp;viewid=" rel="nofollow">http://xrmdroid:5555/XRMfinsights/main.aspx?etn=opportunity&amp;pagetype=entitylist&amp;viewid=</a>{00000000-0000-0000-00AA-000010003001}&amp;viewtype=1039&amp;navbar=off&amp;cmdbar=false</p>  <p>But i am unable to use this in an iframe in a html page in an application .Is it possible to use url addressable form and views in application hosted outside crm ? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <p>ravi sagi</p>
