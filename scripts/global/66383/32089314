<p>We are currently using CRM 2015 ONLINE and we have a requirement to find and delete unused fields from CRM organization. Also, we feel there are certain performance gains to be had by removing unused fields – especially Lookup and Picklist/Option Set-type fields. Since, these kinds of fields force CRM to get information from other database tables every time they are referenced, so it’s wasted effort to try to fetch that data when you know there never will be anything to fetch.</p>  <p>Do you have any way to figure out, which “columns” are null  OR Which columns has count 0 ? And does not contain any value in Table? OR I'm looking for a script/way (to do in crm ONLINE) that will do a count for every column in a table including the number of null values</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zyGKK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zyGKK.png" alt="Expected results"></a></p>
