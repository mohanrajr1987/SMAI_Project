<p>I made a report using MS VisualStudio Reporting Services. Report includs my scalar function that works correctly in MSVS and in MS SQL Management Studio. When I upload this report to CRM without my function - it works. When I use it - I have the next problem: </p>  <pre><code>Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManagerParserErrorException: The message received from the server could not be parsed. Common causes for this error are when the response is modified by calls to Response.Write(), response filters, HttpModules, or server trace is enabled.  Details: Error parsing near '&lt;!DOCTYPE html &gt;&lt;h'.  </code></pre>  <p>I use IE11, MSVS 12 and MS SQL Management Studio 12.</p>
