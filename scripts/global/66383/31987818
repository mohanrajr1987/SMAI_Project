<p>I am fairly new to CRM and I am using CRM Dynamics 2011. I am trying to read values from an Activity and populate the values into a Lead form when the Activity is saved. The scenario is that , on the Lead form there is a section which holds an Activity, so when I create a new Activity(phone-call,sms,email etc), I want to read the createdon date of that particular activity and set the value to a date field on the parent Lead form. What I have gathered is that I will write a JavaScript function on the Activity , what I am battling to understand is how to write the values of the Activity to the Lead as this function will be OnSave event of an Activity, how do I write those values across to the Parent Lead, Any ideas I would appreciate any help or guidance.</p>
