<p>I'm using a pre-operation plugin on create of email to change the entity reference on the email's <strong>"from"</strong> attribute. This is the code I use for the setting:</p>  <pre><code>((EntityCollection)entity.Attributes["from"]).Entities[0].Attributes["partyid"] = erQueue;  //erQueue is an entityReference of a certain queue </code></pre>  <p>I also want the email to be sent from the <strong>queue</strong> email adddress, and not from the original sender's address. should I also set the <strong>"addressused</strong> attribue of the "from" activityparty, or would it happen automatically?</p>
