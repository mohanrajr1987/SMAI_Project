<p>I have added 3 buttons to the toolbar in order to process records from an existing CRM form: "Process Selected Records", "Process All Records on Page", "Process All Records from All Pages".</p>  <p>Dealing with "Selected records" and "All records on Page" is fairly simple as the records can be accessed with settings in the RibbonDiffXml CommandDefinition:</p>  <pre><code>    CrmParameter Value="SelectedControlAllItemReferences"     CrmParameter Value="SelectedControlSelectedItemReferences"  </code></pre>  <p>I'm looking for a way, with javascript, to access all records from all pages of the form's grid when the user presses the toolbar button that I have added. I'm quite sure that those records would not exist in the client's page and that I'd have to retrieve them from the server somehow, but I'm not sure how to go about doing that.</p>
