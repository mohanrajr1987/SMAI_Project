<p>Hi peeps on stackoverflow,</p>  <p>Product: CRM2011, should be latest roll-up</p>  <p>I'm currently trying to get the following to Work:  - A custom CRM form has been made. This form contain the 'Notes' tab. I would like to dynamically 'expand' this IF and only IF the 'Notes' tab contains notes data. I'm trying to do this through JavaScript loaded into 'Form Libraries'. I can easily 'expand' the notes field but I'm having serious trouble determining if the 'Notes' tab contains notes data.</p>  <p>I can understand that accessing the 'notes' data through the DOM is not a good idea so I've tried through XRM. Looked through <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg334351(v=crm.5).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg334351(v=crm.5).aspx</a> to see my options. But I can't seem to get to one where I can access 'notes' and base the expansion of the notes field on if there is data or not in 'notes'.</p>  <p>Is this possible? I'm looking forward to hear from you and thank you very much.</p>
