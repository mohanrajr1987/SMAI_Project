<p>I've a datetime field with date only as format. Also, I've added a script at onload so that whenever a record is accessed <code>12:00</code> should be added to that field. It works as expected and add 12 hours to the time part. But it do not update the date accordingly.</p>  <p>For example, I've Date Become Manager field and its value is <code>'Thu Apr 30 23:00:00 UTC-1200 1992'</code>. And after adding 12 hours it updates the time part as <code>'Thu Apr 30 12:00:00 UTC-1200 1992'</code> but do not add anything to its date. Following is my snippet for this to update.</p>  <pre><code>    function updateFields(field){     var dateField = Xrm.Page.getAttribute(field);     if(dateField.getValue()== null)     {         dateField.setValue(new Date());     }     dateField.setValue(dateField.getValue().setHours(12, 0, 0)); } </code></pre>  <p>Please let me know if I am doing something wrong in it.</p>
