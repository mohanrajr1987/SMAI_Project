<p>I have couple questions please.</p>  <p>1- When <strong>plugin A</strong> triggers on an event and caused another <strong>plugin B</strong> to trigger, does <strong>Plugin B</strong> executes in the same Event execution pipeline as <strong>plugin A</strong>?</p>  <p>2- If the above is true and <strong>plugin A</strong> and <strong>Plugin B</strong> executes in the same Event execution pipeline do they both have 2 minutes to complete (since the maximum execution time of a  plugin in dynamic CRM is 2 minutes) or each one of them has 2 minutes to complete which makes the total execution time allowed for both of them to complete is 4 minutes?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
