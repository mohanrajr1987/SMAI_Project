<p>I have an MVC Controller already written. Now, I have to code the same action methods of the MVC Controller to a <strong>new API Controller</strong>. </p>  <p>What all changes would be needed to put a method in the API Controller?</p>  <p>For Eg. MVC Controller Code</p>  <pre><code>    [HttpGet]     [EAuthorize(xyz)]     public ActionResult Trans()     {         var user = (User)WebSession.CurrentUser;         var mTrans = mTransLMgr.InitializeMTrans(user.currentSelectedEntity.Value);         mTransLMgr.AccNum = TController.GetAccountNumberBasedOnPrivilage(x,y);                     return View(mTransLMgr);     } </code></pre>  <p>If I have to implement the same method in an API Controller, what are the changes I will have to implement. The methods should return JSON.</p>
