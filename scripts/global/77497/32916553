<p>I am trying to license an <strong>ASP.NET Web API</strong> application using an <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4940/Using-XML-Digital-Signatures-for-Application-Licen" rel="nofollow">XML Digital Signature</a> and restricting it to one domain per license.  <code>E.g. customerdomain.com</code>.  I won't use the web to verify the license so it looks like <strong>XML Digital Signatures</strong> are a good way as in the linked article.  </p>  <p>I've never had to license any software so I'm not sure XML Digital Signatures are still used or if this approach is outdated?</p>  <p>I also can't figure out how to incorporate the customer-specific <strong>domain</strong> into the <strong>XML Digital Signature</strong> or if that is even possible?</p>
