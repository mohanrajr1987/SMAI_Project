<p>We are working on building an api with versioning in the route. It has been asked that when we create a new version that we only create the controllers that are changing and update the appropriate actions.</p>  <p>Through modifications of the IDirectRouteProvider and IHttpControllerSelector I have managed to get webapi to register the routes that are inherited. However, I have been unsuccessful in getting it to create new v2 routes for the Controller that have not been updated.</p>  <p>Layout:</p>  <pre><code>-Controllers --v1 ----FooController [GetList, Get] ----BarController [GetList, Get] --v2 ----FooController : v1.FooController [GetList] </code></pre>  <p>When the system starts we expect the follow, however the last 2 routes are missing.</p>  <ul> <li>/v1/foo</li> <li>/v1/foo/{id}</li> <li>/v1/bar</li> <li>/v1/bar/{id} </li> <li>/v2/foo </li> <li>/v2/foo/{id}</li> <li>/v2/bar  &lt;----  Missing</li> <li>/v2/bar/{id} &lt;--- Missing</li> </ul>
