<p>I am working on a azure application where I am providing a hulu-based service where paying users can watch videos for a monthly fee.  I would like to use azure media services to storing and streaming the videos.  I understand how to upload the videos and how to create locators, etc.  I want users to be able to view the videos, just not be able to download and store them on their computers.  I read about the AES encryption features for Azure Media Services but am confused about the streaming portion of this process.  What kind of performance issues would I have in this scenario?  Are there any other strategies I should consider when trying to allow user to view but not download, for my usership only?</p>
