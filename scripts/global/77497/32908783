<p>Im developing a ASP.NET WebApi using a specialized implementation of the <code>ExceptionLogger</code> and <code>ExceptionHandler</code> but i have some doubts about those two classes. By using the <code>ExceptionHandler</code> class im returning some custom response message to the client, so in every exception that might occours on the controller or service layer it is handled in this class.  My first question is, can it replace all the <code>try/catch</code> blocks on the controller? The documentation says that the  <code>ExceptionHandler</code> is a global filter, and it always be fired.</p>  <p>My other doubt is if its possible to catch the 404(not found) errors within this class. I tried but i couldnt catch it.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
