<p>Hi I am new in writing Web Api, and today I want to set up a webAPI and have my AngularJS app to connect to it. </p>  <p>I was able to create to create the webAPI by creating new project in Visual Studio 2013, however I can see that no connections appear under <strong>Data Connection</strong>, do any of you know what I need to do so database connection appears here, including the API default tables?? Such as user account table and so on?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8vyNH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8vyNH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thank you. </p>  <p>***** Updated ******</p>  <p>When I click on <strong>Add New Connection</strong> as @Bob requested I get a popup which has no values under server (so dropdown isn't populated), so not very sure what to add in there. Also do you think I need to install some SQL in my machine or similar? From my understanding the db should have been created as soon as I created the project, also this is what I have noticed on other tutorials. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V7gdO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V7gdO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Any Suggestions?</p>
