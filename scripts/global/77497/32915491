<p>I have a property in my web api self hosted app that I would like to inject to my controllers, which is loaded via reflection, here is my startup code:</p>  <pre><code>public CustomClass StuffInstance { get; set; }   // This method is required by Katana: public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app) {     ConfigureOAuth(app);     var webApiConfiguration = ConfigureWebApi();      // Use the extension method provided by the WebApi.Owin library:     app.UseWebApi(webApiConfiguration); } </code></pre>  <p>my controllers are mostly scaffolded and some like:</p>  <pre><code>// PUT: api/EventTypeDescriptions/5 [ResponseType(typeof(void))] public IHttpActionResult PutStuff(int id, int something) {     //do stuff     //here i would like to use StuffInstance like a singleton     return StatusCode(HttpStatusCode.NoContent); } </code></pre>  <p>how can a inject StuffInstance to my controllers?</p>
