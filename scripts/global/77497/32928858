<p>My web API captures the requesting client's User-Agent header for analytics purposes. When run in local IIS, everything is fine</p>  <pre><code>Request.Headers.UserAgent.ToString() </code></pre>  <p>gets me the user agent string.</p>  <p>However, when deployed to Azure, I get "EMA-Gateway" as the user agent string, defeating my analytics. I assume this is because there is a load-balancing proxy in front of my API. My question is: can I recover the requester's user agent  string when running in Azure, and if so, how?</p>
