<p>I installed VS2015 and the latest Azure SDK. I'm somewhat confused by the addition of new project templates compared to VS2013 and the previous Azure SDK. I'm trying to get my head around the new Azure App Service.</p>  <p>I used to create a Web API project and publish it as an Azure Cloud Service. Now, I'm offered more options:</p>  <pre><code>1) Azure Cloud Service -&gt; ASP.NET Web Role -&gt; Web API </code></pre>  <p>I'm familiar with this one.</p>  <pre><code>2) Azure Cloud Service -&gt; ASP.NET Web Role -&gt; Azure API App </code></pre>  <p>Why would anyone create an Azure API App and publish it as a cloud service?</p>  <pre><code>3) ASP.NET Web Application -&gt; Web API 4) ASP.NET Web Application -&gt; Azure API App </code></pre>  <p>These two are essentially the same as the first two without the cloud service template. However, the way they are published confuse me even more. You could publish each as a Microsoft Azure Web App or Microsoft Azure API App.</p>  <p>How do the following compare and contrast:</p>  <ul> <li>Web API -> Published as a Web App </li> <li>Web API -> Published as an API APP</li> <li>API App -> Published as a Web App </li> <li>API App -> Published as an API APP</li> </ul>
