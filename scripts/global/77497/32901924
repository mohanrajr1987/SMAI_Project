<p>I've set up my data model and everything that is required to get started using Web API 2. Users can now register get their token and start calling actions. However, I am trying to find a proper solution for a relatively simple requirement. Other than 'Users' I have let's say 'Devices' on the <code>POST</code> Method for /devices I'd like to generate a <code>token</code> for that device without storing <code>User</code> information, such as e-mail etc...</p>  <p>I can't find any resource online to put in my the right direction. Can someone please suggest where I should start? I have the book called 'Pro Web API Security' and I've read a couple of articles about generating tokens but everything tackles the 'User' concept not a custom object.</p>
