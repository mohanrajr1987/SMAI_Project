<p>I'm currently using ASP .NET MVC and Web API 2 in parallel in a project I'm working on. </p>  <p>I'd like to be able to include links to certain MVC Actions from within my API responses, as these actions often relate to the resources being provided.</p>  <p>The issue is that I have no MVC HttpContext from within Web API, so I cannot use the Url.Action method to generate links. My only other option is to manually/hard-code the links but I'd rather not take this approach as it doesn't scale.</p>  <p>Any way to spawn a MVC HttpContext/RequestContext?</p>
