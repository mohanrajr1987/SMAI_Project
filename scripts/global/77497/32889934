<p>I'm getting up to speed with Polymer as a means to creating web components.  I love the idea of creating HTML tags for embedding functionality.</p>  <p>I've been Googling around for examples of calling ASP.Net WEB API services inside a Polymer element and cannot find a good example.  Can anyone recommend approaches or provide links, examples of how they've consumed ASP.Net WebAPI services from inside a Polymer element please?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
