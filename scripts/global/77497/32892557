<p>I am trying to enable versioning on a REST API, where the version is specified in the header, as <code>"api-version":2</code>.</p>  <p>According to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jongalloway/looking-at-asp-net-mvc-5-1-and-web-api-2-1-part-2-attribute-routing-with-custom-constraints" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> I just need to create</p>  <p><code>VersionConstraint : IHttpRouteConstraint</code></p>  <p>and </p>  <p><code>VersionedRoute: RouteFactoryAttribute</code></p>  <p>The usage would be to apply the <code>[VersionedRoute("api/controllerName", 2)]</code> Attribute to Controllers, which are designed for specific versions (e.g. version 2 in this case).</p>  <p>This is all good and well, but unfortunately, it's all in MVC5 and I'm using MVC6. Therefore, <code>RouteFactoryAttribute</code> and <code>IHttpRouteConstraint</code> don't work.</p>  <p>I managed to find <code>IRouteConstraint</code> to replace <code>IHttpRouteConstraint</code> (hoping it will work), but I cannot find a replacement for <code>RouteFactoryAttribute</code>.</p>  <p>If anyone can provide a sample of this using MVC 6, or at least mention the correct classes (ideally with namespaces) I need to inherit from?</p>
