<p>I have established standard security with ASP.NET Web API using the default settings provided by the framework. I am successfully creating users, roles, claims etc... However, some other types of authentication is required. We will be working on an application that has limited access to the API. However, that application does not share the <code>ApplicationUser</code> model. Does not have a FirstName or LastName for example.. How to extend the current setup to enable authentication and authorization for these external apps?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
