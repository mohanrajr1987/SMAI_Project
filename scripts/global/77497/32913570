I need to write client-server application that do some things.</p>  <p>Client side: console application that waiting messages from web site, and answer on this messages. </p>  <p>Server side: web application on that another client, do something and after this controller create message and send this to client side.</p>  <p>For server side I want to use asp.net mvc with webapi and for client side .net console application. But I don't understand how I can receive message from site like push in console. </p>  <p>To resolve my problem I have one idea: every 5 seconds from client ask server. But I think that is not right.
