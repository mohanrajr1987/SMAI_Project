<p>I'm looking for a resource to demonstrate the best way of securing a MVC 5 WebAPI service with access rules. </p>  <p>For instance, if a user owns an entity, how to prevent another user from editing it. Or maybe if a sandboxing a user to entities it's responsible for. </p>  <p>Looking around, I haven't found much in the way of an answer which makes me think I'm not asking the right question. Surely adding this logic to each controller method is not the correct way of accomplishing the task. </p>  <p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
