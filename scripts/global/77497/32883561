<p>I have an asp.net web api application which has to serve files. To do that I'm using build-in file server like this:</p>  <pre><code>            appBuilder.UseFileServer(fileServerOptions); </code></pre>  <p>How do enable gzipping for files that are served through this file server?</p>  <p>I've tried to use package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.MessageHandlers.Compression.Compressor and to apply it with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>            config.MessageHandlers.Insert(0, new ServerCompressionHandler(new GZipCompressor(), new DeflateCompressor())); </code></pre>  <p>But it didn't help :(</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
