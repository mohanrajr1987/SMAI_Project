<p>I tried to use <code>file_get_contents()</code> function in my project developed in Laravel. I used this function to send SMS in bulk and retrive its response. </p>  <p>First I encoded URL with sms providers specification and tested with five users and it worked well.  But after that I tried to send SMS to 60 mobile numbers through this URL by using <code>file_get_contents()</code> function, it shows error <code>failed to open stream: HTTP request failed</code>.  I have gone through related doubts in stack over flow, but that solutions are not working. Can anyone help?</p>
