<p>I do some calculations in the controller, and pass the data to my view like this.</p>  <pre><code>return View::make('fend.clist', compact('detail_')); </code></pre>  <p>From this view controller "fend.clist" I'd like to open another view (blade) along with the 'detail_' variable which basically has some data that I need to show there. I tried POSTing it, but I wasn't able to recieve the data completely.  How else can I pass data from one view to another view?</p>
