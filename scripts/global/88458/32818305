<p>I have an <code>Accomodation</code> and a <code>Feature</code> Model. An accomodation can have many features (kitchen, balcony, etc.) via <code>accomodation_feature</code> pivot table:</p>  <pre><code>//accomodation model public function features() {           return $this-&gt;belongsToMany('Feature'); } </code></pre>  <p>I want to select ALL accomodations that have <strong>ALL</strong> selected features activated. For example I want all accomodations that have a balcony AND a kitchen AND a microwave oven.</p>  <p>I tried the following but I get every accomodation that has a balcony OR a kitchen OR a microwave oven:</p>  <pre><code>$features = array("1", "2", "3"); //id's of the features I want to select  $accomodations = Accomodation ::whereHas('features', function($q) use ($features)                 {                     $q-&gt;whereIn('features.id', $features);                 })                                 -&gt;get(); </code></pre>  <p>How can I select all accomodations that have <strong>ALL</strong> of the provided features?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help, and sorry for the (maybe) misleading title. I couldn't think of anything more appropriate.</p>
