<p>I am using Laravel 4.2 and have a table called <em>users</em> and a column in that table labeled <strong>name</strong>. I also have a transactions table that has 2 columns which are both foreign keys that reference the primary key of the <em>users</em> table. One of the rows in the <em>transactions</em> is labeled <em>given_to</em> and the other is labeled <em>received_from</em>. <strong>How can I access the name associated with the given_to user id from the transactions table using Eloquent?</strong> I tried the following in a view and received a <em>trying to get property of non-object error</em>:</p>  <pre><code>@foreach($transactions as $transaction)     {{ $transaction-&gt;given_to-&gt;name }} @endforeach  </code></pre>
