<p>It is known that after creating a new model, there is a function to change the table used by the model.</p>  <p>For example,</p>  <pre><code>$example_model = new ExampleModel; $example_model-&gt;setTable('myTable_'.$some_other_variable); </code></pre>  <p>However, if I am finding record from table, is there a way to choose the table before querying the database?</p>  <p>i.e. something like this</p>  <pre><code>$example_model = ExampleModel::setTable('myTable_'.$some_other_variable)-&gt;where('myColumn', $variable_to_be_compared)-&gt;get(); </code></pre>  <p>(Noticed that the following line is not correct. I will says setTable is not a static method)</p>  <p>I have some custom function in my model, so I would prefer not to use <code>DB::table('myTable_'.$some_other_variable)</code>.</p>
