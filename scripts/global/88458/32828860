<p>I want to run a for-loop with reading user table data and updating the same data constantly. </p>  <p>Step 1: Read <code>age</code> field from table <code>user</code> where <code>userID =1</code></p>  <p>Step 2: Update <code>age</code> field of table <code>user</code>  set <code>age= age + 1</code> where <code>userID=1</code></p>  <p>Step 3: Go to step 1 for 100 times</p>  <p>As I am selecting the data row as soon as I request for the data row update, I am missing the last updated data. How I can keep selecting the data record locked  until the latest update happens in the record? Can someone please help me with solution in laravel 4 or raw mysql.</p>
