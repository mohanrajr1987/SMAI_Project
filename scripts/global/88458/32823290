<p>I have the following boot method setup in my <code>user</code> model:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * Boot the model.  *  */ public static function boot() {     parent::boot();      static::deleting(function($user)     {         $user-&gt;roles()-&gt;detach();         $user-&gt;supervisors()-&gt;detach();         $user-&gt;types()-&gt;detach();         $user-&gt;rates()-&gt;detach();         $user-&gt;miscs()-&gt;detach();         $user-&gt;timesheets()-&gt;delete();     }); } </code></pre>  <p>A user can have many timesheets so I have a <code>hasMany</code> relationship setup for timesheets in the user model.</p>  <pre><code>/**  * The timesheets that belong to the user.  *  * @return Object  */ public function timesheets() {     return $this-&gt;hasMany('App\Models\Timesheet\Timesheet'); } </code></pre>  <p>A timesheet can also have many data, so I have added a relationship in the timesheet model:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * The data that belong to the timesheet.  *  * @return Object  */ public function data() {     return $this-&gt;hasMany('App\Models\Timesheet\DataTimesheet'); } </code></pre>  <p>My question is, when I delete a user, it should delete the timesheet and all data associated with it.  At the moment, when I delete a user it deletes the user and the timesheet but not the data (DataTimesheet).  </p>  <p>When I delete a timesheet separately, the data gets deleted.</p>  <p><strong>Can anyone suggest how I can delete the data as well when a user is deleted?</strong></p>
