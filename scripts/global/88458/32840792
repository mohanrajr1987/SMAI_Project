<p>I have a form for a participant and that participant can invite 3 people. So when you add a friend some extra form fields appear on the screen to register/invite the invited person.</p>  <p>Per participation (= me + max 3 friends) there needs to be one valid clientNumber.</p>  <p>The part for the friends is build on an array of input fields like:</p>  <p>friend_firstname[] friend_clientNumber</p>  <p>The owner part (mer) are just regular fields.</p>  <p>I can validate each of these fields correctly expect for the client number. At the left side (index) of the array I know I can do friend_firstname.$key but how do I handle this in the rule part it self, combined with the required_without_all validation rule in Laravel?</p>  <p>What I currently have:</p>  <pre><code>'clientNumber' =&gt; 'required_without_all:friend_clientNumber.0, friend_clientNumber.1, friend_clientNumber.2|clientnumber',  $rules['friend_clientNumber.'.$key] = "required_without_all:clientNumber,friend_clientNumber.". $field1 .", friend_clientNumber.".$field2."|clientnumber"; </code></pre>  <p>But i always get the error that at least one client number is required. Somebody who can help me?</p>  <p>ps. I have checks wether a friend is added or not, that part is working fine, I did not add that code to avoid misunderstandings.</p>  <p>ps. ps. If something is not clear, please ask ;)</p>  <p>ps. ps. ps. this app is being build in Laravel 4.1 (yes I know 5.1 is there, but I have no other options it has to run on servers with php 5.3)</p>
