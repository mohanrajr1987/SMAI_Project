<p>i have this dropdownlist that is based on larvel's eloquent and i kinda wanted to use both the data that it has ex. the name and the id. To clearly show this, here is the code snippet in my controller </p>  <pre><code>$modules = prchorder::lists('ModuleName','ModuleID'); </code></pre>  <p>then i used this in my view as :</p>  <pre><code>{{ Form::label('module', 'Select Module: ') }}       {{ Form::select('ModuleInfo', array(null=&gt;'Please Select Module') + $modules , Input::old('ModuleInfo'), array('class'=&gt;'form-control'))}} </code></pre>  <p>the problem now is that i need to get both the 'ModuleName' and the 'ModuleID' because i will use it in the store function inside the controller when the user clicked submit. i know that when i do this  <code>$module = Input::get('ModuleInfo');</code> the only data i will be getting is the ModuleID. Is there any way i could also get the ModuleName? any suggestions?</p>
