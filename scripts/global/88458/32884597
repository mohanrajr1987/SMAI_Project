<p>I have this code that gets an object in a session and i put it in a certain variable. Then i wanted to use it in the laravel 4.2 'same' validation. So far here is the code i have</p>  <pre><code>        session_start();         $getsCapt = $_SESSION["captcha"];          $rules = array(             'st'           =&gt; 'required',             'capt'         =&gt; 'required|numeric|same:$getsCapt'         ); </code></pre>  <p>It is not doing anything. What i wanted to have is i'll compare the value i get from the session with the value i get from the textbox in my view named 'capt' but so far its not doing anything. any ideas to do this properly?</p>
