<p>I need to export some visual data generated in Java to PNG files. The approach I am using in the source code is:</p>  <pre><code>//create jframe then draw on it... jframe.setSize(jrame.getPreferredSize()); BufferedImage bufferedImage = new BufferedImage(jframe.getWidth(), jframe.getHeight(), BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB); jframe.paint(bufferedImage.getGraphics()); jframe.dispose(); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that when the drawing is large (because it needs to be), sometimes the exporting failures:</p>  <p><strong><em>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Dimensions (width=73614 height=73540) are too large</em></strong></p>  <p>Exporting just part of the image is not an option for me. What can I export it? Maybe a customized exportation? An external library/API? It is fine for me if it used other image extensions besides png.</p>  <p>EDIT: jframe already handles the height and width scrolls correctly as the content gets bigger then monitor size. The exporting process works for that already as well.</p>
