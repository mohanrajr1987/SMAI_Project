<p>I have read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11148950/how-to-detect-jframe-window-minimize-and-maximize-events">this question</a> and, in order to get the current "status" of my JFrame I have added a property like:</p>  <pre><code>private static boolean isMinimized = false; </code></pre>  <p>And then using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/event/WindowListener.html" rel="nofollow">WindowsListener</a> I change this "property" within <code>windowIconified()</code>, <code>windowDeiconified()</code> methods, but I feel like I'm missing something.</p>  <p>Is there a property inside the <code>JFrame</code> class that let me know if my app is currently minimized or not? like... <code>myFrame.isMinimized()</code> or <code>myFrame.isIconified()</code>?</p>  <p>I feel like this is a really simple question, and I guess this already has an obvious answer, so if this is the case, feel free to mark it like duplicated.</p>
