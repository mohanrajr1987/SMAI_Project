<p>I'm creating program which has JFrame, welcome state JPanel, and game JPanel. This is short method, that switch JPanels in JFrame, from welcomeState JPanel, to game JPanel.</p>  <pre><code>public static void startGameState(){     if (!Preferences.gameView) return;     /*      * Remove menu state, and set game state      */     gameState = new GameBoard();       frame.setContentPane(gameState);     frame.invalidate();     frame.validate();     /*      * Run Server Connection Thread      */     connectionHandler.start();     /*      * Run Game engine      * and go to Game view      */     gameState.start(); } </code></pre>  <p>Everything works fine. My Problem starts here. I have changed GameBoard class. It is no longer extending JPanel class. Now it is extending Canvas. My question is - how to remove first JPanel, and add Canvas GameBoard class instead when Im switching program states? </p>
