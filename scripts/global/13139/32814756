<p>Here is some of my code. It should be noted that this is not my exact code as I did have much more added, but long story short, I can guarantee that none of the controls touch each other, and that they are all added to this frame. Where then is my problem. It should be noted that I am not highly experienced with this, and as such need specific help. I don't see why these are giving me problems, such as buttons being too big and out of place, but I need them in the exact location which I specify at the exact size, and never disappearing or flickering. What can I do?</p>  <pre><code>public class TesterFrame extends JFrame{     public TesterFrame(){         setSize(500,500);         JButton jb = new JButton("Button");         jb.setLocation(100, 100);         jb.setSize(20,20);         JCheckBox jcb = new JCheckBox("CheckBox");         jcb.setLocation(20,20);         jcb.setSize(30,30);         add(jb); add(jcb);         JButton jb2=new JButton("BUTTON");         jb2.setLocation(60,60);         jb2.setSize(30,30);         add(jb2);         setVisible(true);     } } </code></pre>
