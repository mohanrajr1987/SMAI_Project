<p>I have one <strong>main Window</strong> in my Java application (JFrame). Now I want to determine if the user is still using the window. To achieve this I will run a timer for like 15 minutes and after the timer runs out, for example my application closes. So far so good but how can I determine if the user clicked on something in the window?</p>  <p>I want to reset my timer every time an action is performed on the main window itself. Of course I could add <code>actionListeners</code> (Action performed) to every element in my window but this seems to be "too much". Is there any <code>actionListener</code> that you can attach to you main frame (window) that listens to <strong>any</strong> action?</p>
