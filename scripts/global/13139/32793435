<p>I tried this Layout but Its shows only one panel. I need leftpanel (Panel 1) a bit smaller than the second Panel. It is currently showing the menu and Panel 1 in center.</p>  <p>I tried all of the every layout examples, but still could not get panel 2 to show.</p>  <p>I humbly await any advice that may help resolve my issue.</p>  <pre><code>public PrintBillPanel() {     GridLayout lay1 = new GridLayout(0, 2, 10, 5);     mainPanel = new JPanel();     mainPanel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(mainPanel, BoxLayout.X_AXIS));     printBill = new JPanel();     showBill = new JPanel();     printBill.setLayout(lay1);     mainPanel.add(printBill);     mainPanel.add(showBill);     mainPanel.setVisible(false); } </code></pre>
