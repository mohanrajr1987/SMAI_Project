<p>In java, Say I have a JFrame (say JFrame2) which is created by clicking a button on the first Jframe (JFrame1).  How do I get a selected value from the second (Jframe2) back to the first one without creating a new instance of the first frame (Jframe1).</p>  <p>i.e I want to make Jframe2 a subform of JFrame1. Just the way a <code>JOptionFrame.showMessageDialog()</code> would return a value.</p>
