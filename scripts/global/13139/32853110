<p>My question have 3 parts.</p>  <ol> <li>I would like to know, how can I set <code>JFrame</code> window to be resizable, but can not go under a minim size so the user cant make it smaller then the minimum size. </li> <li>I would like to know, how can I set <code>JFrame</code> window to be resizable, but still keep the aspect ratio (16:9) even if the user is resizing it.</li> <li>I would like to know, how can I make the program become really full screen after he clicks a button so there are no borders and runs like a game or something (and if there is any specific issues how can I revert it back safely).</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks for your help and patient for my not perfect English and not perfect Java knowledge.</p>  <p>The provided answer is useful and answers part of my question, but still most of it still blank for me.</p>  <p>The part of the code:</p>  <pre><code>private void createDisplay() {     GraphicsDevice gd = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getDefaultScreenDevice();      frame = new JFrame(title);                                              //setting the title of the window     frame.setSize(width, height);                                           //setting the width and height of the window     frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);                   //make sure program closes down properly     frame.setResizable(true);     frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);                                      //the window will apparel on the center     frame.setVisible(true);     frame.setIconImage(Assets.ImageMap.get("icon"));      canvas = new Canvas();     canvas.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(width, height));     canvas.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(width, height));     canvas.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(gd.getDisplayMode().getWidth() / 2, gd.getDisplayMode().getHeight() / 2));     canvas.setFocusable(false);      frame.add(canvas);     frame.pack();                                                           //resize the window a little bit so able to see all of canvas } </code></pre>
