<p>I want to know if it's possible and if yes how to do it. I got my server and I want to launch a java.jar file on my website, in PHP. I found the way to run jar file remotely on my PC from another one, but what I need to achieve is launching the jar that is on my PC(server) on user's PC in web browser window, so he can see everything and interact with it. I made the Java app <code>JFrame</code>.</p>  <p>If you need further info just ask, not sure what exactly is required here. And if you want to know what it is - simple game with mouse and keyboard control.</p>
