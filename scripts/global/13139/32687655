<p>I have a little game that uses <code>JFrame</code>, I was working with <strong>Intellij</strong> and <code>Windows 7</code> normally and changed my <code>OS</code> and gave <code>Manjaro</code> a try. Everything works fine until I <code>compile</code> my <code>code</code>, my game doesn't appear, just a white window.</p>  <p>I had installed <code>openJDK</code> and than I read that <code>OracleJDK</code> is best, I removed <code>openJDK</code> and installed Oracle Jdk but nothing changes, white screen again.</p>
