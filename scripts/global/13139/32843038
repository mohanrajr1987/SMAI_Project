<p>I have a JFrame that holds a JPanel. I want to make the frame completely transparent and the panel slightly transparent.</p>  <p>I'm using the following code to do so:</p>  <pre><code>frame.setBackground(new Color(0, 0, 0, 0)); panel.setBackground(new Color(51, 51, 51, 190)); </code></pre>  <p>The desired effect is achieved, however, when I make the JFrame transparent using this method it distorts all of the other components. </p>  <p>The following image demonstrates this better than I can explain.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fch0x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fch0x.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>On the left is an example with no transparency and the text appears clearly. On the right the panel and the frame are set using the code above, and the text is distorted.</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
