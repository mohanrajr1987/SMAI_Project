<p>Before I start I should say that I'm fairly new to programming. Currently trying to make a script that spawns the player at the same spot where he died, however whenever I run the script it gives me this error. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[ERROR] addons/aaa/lua/weapons/test.lua:9: attempt to index global   'ent' (a nil value)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here is the code.</p>  <pre><code>--Command concommand.Add( "test_command", function( ply )   local hi = ply:GetPos()   ply:Spawn()   ent.ply:setPos (hi)   end)   </code></pre>  <p>(That's the entire script btw) If anyone could help me that would be greatly appreciated. </p>
