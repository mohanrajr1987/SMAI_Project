<p>We're loading data into CRM via SSIS, and our database contains nulls in string columns. We need to determine how to handle these, and if there's no difference between the empty string and null in CRM, we'd prefer to treat nulls as empty strnigs.</p>  <p>Does CRM contain nulls? Is there a practical difference between nulls and empty strings in CRM?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Ok I got it backwards - when we store empty strings in CRM, we're getting NULL back as a result - does CRM store empty strings as nulls, or is it just weirdness with out SSIS connector?</p>
