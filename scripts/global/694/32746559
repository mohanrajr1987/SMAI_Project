<p>I have this code:</p>  <pre><code>    blocks.clear();     if(onStart.parts==null){System.out.println("null before");}     blocks.add(onStart);     if(blocks.get(0).parts==null){System.out.println("null after");} </code></pre>  <p>where blocks is an initialized <code>ArrayList&lt;Block&gt;</code>, and parts is a field of Block of type <code>ArrayList&lt;BlockPart&gt;</code>. For some reason, that snippet of code only outputs "<code>null after</code>". Why does the parts field become null?</p>  <p>EDIT: I have added the following code:</p>  <pre><code>    System.out.println(blocks.get(0)==onStart?"same":"not same");     System.out.println(blocks.get(0).parts==onStart.parts?"same":"not same"); </code></pre>  <p>The output is now:</p>  <pre><code>same not same </code></pre>  <p>Strangely, the <code>null after</code> isn't showing in the console anymore.</p>  <p>EDIT 2: Replacing parts with name causes only <code>null after</code> to show. I don't know why the issue with the parts field somehow fixed itself. Before, I made the parts field final, but then removed the final modifier from it because I thought that I might want to change .parts later on. Now, it fixed itself. IDK why.</p>
