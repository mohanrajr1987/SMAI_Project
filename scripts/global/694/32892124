<p>While trying to learn JavaScript I came across a few snippets of code that has confused me.</p>  <p>My original code that I was messing around with was:</p>  <pre><code>var username = prompt("Choose a username:");  if (username === null) {     alert("Username is required!"); } else {     console.log("Your username is: " + username); } </code></pre>  <p>This <strong>didn't</strong> work. So I came here and found this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2647867/how-to-determine-if-variable-is-undefined-or-null">How to determine if variable is 'undefined' or 'null'</a>. Even though I found my solution it raised more questions that I couldn't find the answer for within the sea of "answers".</p>  <p>The first solution that has 910 upvotes uses <code>typeof</code>, but this <strong>didn't</strong> work for me:</p>  <pre><code>var username = prompt("Choose a username:");  if (typeof username === 'undefined'){     alert("Username is required!"); } else {     console.log("Your username is: " + username); } </code></pre>  <p>It also states a shorter version, which <strong>did</strong> work for me:</p>  <pre><code>var username = prompt("Choose a username:");  if (!username){     alert("Username is required!"); } else {     console.log("Your username is: " + username); } </code></pre>  <p>Another answer caught my eye as it included a part of my personal code <code>username === null</code>, which has 319 upvotes, but this <strong>didn't</strong> work for me either:</p>  <pre><code>var username = prompt("Choose a username:");  if (username === undefined || username === null) {     alert("Username is required!"); } else {     console.log("Your username is: " + username); } </code></pre>  <p>An edit to the answer also states that using just <code>username === null</code> is sufficient.</p>  <p>So my <strong>question</strong> is why does <code>!username</code> work with that specific code but the others did not?</p>
