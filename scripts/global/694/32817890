<p>I have this code in Java:</p>  <pre><code>String foo = request.getParameter("bar"); if (foo == null) {      foo = "";  } </code></pre>  <p>There are multiple values checked this way. In other languages I would probably be able to do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>String foo = request.getParameter("bar") || ""; </code></pre>  <p>I was really just wondering if there is an equivalent in Java.</p>
