<p>I have 2 classes:</p>  <pre><code>public class Agent : MonoBehaviour  {     private FSM brain;      void Start ()     {         //Create the FSM that will control this agent         brain = new FSM (this);     } } </code></pre>  <hr>  <pre><code>public class FSM {     //Agent this FSM is attached to     private Agent agent;      //Constructor     public FSM (Agent FSMOwner)     {         agent = FSMOwner;         Debug.Log (agent);     } } </code></pre>  <p>So I have an empty game object which has the Agent script on it. When the program starts, the Agent script instantiates a new FSM class. In the FSM constructor it debugs the agent, but it keeps returning null.</p>  <p>So how do I pass the Agent class to the FSM class so they can communicate with eachother? </p>
