<p>I am using SQL Developer 4.1.1.19.59.</p>  <p>When I execute a procedure from a saved SQL worksheet, I see "task completed in x seconds" in the script output bar. This is quite useful, but is replaced when I execute another procedure in that worksheet. </p>  <p>I would like to see the duration of each query. When I go to SQL History, however, it displays the following for all procedures executed from a saved SQL worksheet:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>SQL: file:/C:/Users/...</p>      <p>Type: Script</p>      <p>Duration(seconds): 0.0</p> </blockquote>  <p>Note that select statements in saved worksheets yield a duration, and execute statements in unsaved SQL worksheets yield a duration. </p>  <p>Is there any way to get the duration of a procedure to appear in SQL History for statements executed in saved worksheets? Or, perhaps the duration is logged somewhere else?</p>
