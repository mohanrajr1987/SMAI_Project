<p>I've always used the coalescing operator (a.k.a. "really surprised operator, i.e. "??") to get rid of phony nullables (usually fetched from DB as allowing nulls but known to me never to be at that value). It looks like so.</p>  <pre><code>int serious = GetSomeReallyNonNullValue(); int? phony = GetNullableButActuallyNonNullValue(); int result = serious + (phony ?? 0); </code></pre>  <p>However, I just noticed that the below actually compiled. Can't see how it makes sense. And I can't see intuitively if null value will evaluate the expression to true or false...</p>  <pre><code>int? test = null; if (test &lt; 1337) ; </code></pre>
