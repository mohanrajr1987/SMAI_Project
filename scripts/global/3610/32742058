<p>I have a curious problem and I can't find how to resolve it. I'm using the JsonSerializable interface in PHP to create a JSON to return. In one object I'm using, I have a variable that is an array of objects. It's working when the array contain only one object but when there is several I get an empty array. I don't understand. Here it's the code :</p>  <pre><code>class SessionDate implements JsonSerializable {      private $_players;      public function getPlayers() { return $this-&gt;_players; }     public function setPlayers($players) {         $this-&gt;_players = $players;     }      public function jsonSerialize(){         return [             'players' =&gt; $this-&gt;getPlayers() // This is an array of player         ];     }  }  class Player implements JsonSerializable {      private $_id;     private $_name;      public function getId() { return $this-&gt;_id; }     public function setId($id) { $this-&gt;_id = $id; }      public function getName() { return $this-&gt;_name; }     public function setName($name) { $this-&gt;_name = $name; }      public function jsonSerialize(){         return [             'id' =&gt; $this-&gt;getId(),             'name' =&gt; $this-&gt;getName()         ];     }  } </code></pre>  <p>And this is how I get the list of players :</p>  <pre><code>        $q = $this-&gt;_db-&gt;prepare('the query');          $q-&gt;execute();         $players = [];         while ($data = $q-&gt;fetch()) {             $sessionPlayer = constructPlayer($data);             $players[] = $sessionPlayer;         }          return $players; </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong ? And why is it working when there is one player and not with more ??</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>** EDIT **</p>  <p>I call the php action with $.ajax and it appears that when there is more than one player, the $.ajax response goes through error. So maybe it's because the JSON is not formatted well...</p>
