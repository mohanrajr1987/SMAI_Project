<p>I'm not good at styling so I will ask straight ahead: how do I draw a border over the whole web application's UI composed of nested views (ion-nav-view)?</p>  <p>My initial try was to set a class on a body:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;body ng-class="{'noConnection': hiresUnavail}" ng-app="app" ng-controller="MainCtrl"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>this is being produced now:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nGNYO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nGNYO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>now, you can see a top-left corner of the web browser. The orange line is the desired border defined in the body tag as you can see upper. So what should I do in order to see this border all round the borders even on the top of the nested ng-views?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
