<p>I'm trying to debug my program with a nested loop to print out all the values in a 2d array. I was getting some unexpected behavior from the loop so i commented out some things and added a simple printf.</p>  <pre><code>`int u = 0;  int y = 0;  char m = 'm';  for (u; u &lt; 12; u++)  {     printf("\n");     for (y; y &lt; 5; y++)     {         //transition[u][x] = &amp;m;         printf("o"); //this nested loop isnt working????          //printf("%c", *transition[u][y]);     }  }` </code></pre>  <p>Clearly this should print 12 rows of 5 'o's. But instead it is only printing out one row of 5 'o's followed by 11 newlines. What in the world is the cause of this?</p>  <p>Edit: Thanks a lot! I failed to realize that y would not set itself back to 0 on the second run through the loop. I guess overlooked this because I'm too used to Java initializing and setting the increment variable within the loop statement. </p>
