<p>I have a mapping as follows,</p>  <pre><code>{   "myindex": {     "mappings": {       "mytype": {         "properties": {           "content": {             "type": "object"           },           "myname": {             "type": "string"           }         }       }     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>the data in "content" field can be a structured and unstructured.</p>  <p>Search query that i have written looks like below,</p>  <pre><code>{   "multi_match": {     "query": "this is a test",     "fields": [       "content",       "content.*"     ],     "type": {"phrase_prefix"}   } } </code></pre>  <p>where <code>content.*</code> helps me to retrieve the search data in case, if it is structured. </p>  <p>for example structure for "content" field looks like below,</p>  <pre><code>{   "fname":"ravinder",   "lastname":"reddy",   "join":"2009-11-15T14:12:12" } </code></pre>  <p>if the Structure contains any "date" type fields like "joindate" as above, then it gives <strong>Date Format exception</strong> and if there is number <strong>Number format Exception</strong>, as the input string is compared to date fields inside elastic search.</p>  <p><strong>NOTE : i cannot have a defined mapping for the Content field .as it is dynamic. I should not use {"date_detection": false} .As i should also perform some range queries on date type fields.</strong></p>  <p>How can i Query for any data inside the elastic search ,such that search query should be unique for structured and unstructured.</p>
