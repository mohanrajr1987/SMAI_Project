<p>I have a pretty simple webpage that contains an embedded video where the page author manually sets <code>$variables</code> at the top of document to set the correct video/photo/title/links, etc. within the "html code" further down the page (for non-expert users to upload and link new content to the template).  It's not the prettiest code but it works. (yay!)</p>  <p>In one place, they need to be able to point a variable to a specific video file, OR upload several files into a new directory and point/transform the variable into an include that runs a randomizer php file. I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT THE RANDOMIZING FUNCTION ALREADY WORKS, I just need to be able to point to it with a <code>$variable</code></p>  <pre><code>$video1sourcedir = '/documents/sword.mov'; //needs to create &lt;video src="/documents/sword.mov" width="400" height="225" controls autoplay loop preload&gt; </code></pre>  <p>or (I wish) they could change it to something like</p>  <pre><code>$video1sourcedir = '&lt;?php include "randvid.php'; //but I can't nest php with echo so that doesn't actually create &lt;video src="&lt;?php include "randvid.php"; ?&gt;" width="400" height="225" controls autoplay loop preload&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So basically does anyone know a way to set <code>$variables</code> at the top of the page that can be called that way?  It would be ok for the <code>$variable</code> to be the entire php include statement but I don't know how to <code>echo</code> or <code>print</code> that correctly</p>  <p>Much thanks!</p>
