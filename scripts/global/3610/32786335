<p>I'm trying to concatenate the different "Name" values from the provided Hash into one string. So the output should be one array or string containing all "Name" values.</p>  <p>The difficulty for me sits in that the <strong>level of nesting varies between two and four parents.</strong></p>  <p>I've tried to solve it in two ways:</p>  <ol> <li>Recursively go through the hash and on each level append the value to an array. Finally spit out the array.</li> <li>Flatten the hash and then cherry pick from that array </li> </ol>  <p>Unfortunately none of the answers given in related questions seemed to work either. I'm sure it's quite simple but I can't seem to figure it out. Many thanks</p>  <pre><code>my_hash = { "BreadCrumbs" =&gt; {                     "Id" =&gt; 375,                     "Name" =&gt; "Willingen",                     "Parent" =&gt; {                         "Id" =&gt; 52272,                         "Name" =&gt; "Wintersport-Arena Sauerland",                         "Parent" =&gt; {                             "Id" =&gt; 8,                              "Name" =&gt; "Germany"                         }                     }                 }             } </code></pre>
