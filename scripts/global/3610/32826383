<p>I have a query (well a part of it - rest is unimportant like pagination):</p>  <pre><code>  "query": {     "filtered": {       "query": {         "bool": {           "must": [             {               "term": {                 "is_active": true               }             }           ],           "should": [             {               "bool": {                 "must": [                   {                     "nested": {                       "path": "skills",                       "query": {                         "bool": {                           "must": [                             {                               "bool": {                                 "must": [                                   {                                     "range": {                                       "skills.value": {                                         "gte": "2"                                       }                                     }                                   },                                   {                                     "term": {                                       "skills.skill.name": "php"                                     }                                   }                                 ]                               }                             }                           ]                         }                       }                     }                   }                 ],                 "boost": 2               }             }           ]         }       }     }   } </code></pre>  <p>It's for searching profile, which has a skill "PHP" with value 2 or more. User can search for multiple skills=>values pair. It's working fine, but I have one question:</p>  <p>How to make a little boost for matched skills which has higher skills.value, just to make person with PHP value 3 be higher in search results than someone with PHP 2 even if both are correct match.</p>
