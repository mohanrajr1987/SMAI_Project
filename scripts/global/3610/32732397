<p>I am learning about nested structs in C, and what I want to do is to be able to assign a value to my struct's member struct. I'm having trouble figuring this out, and I don't want to force myself to initialize the member struct in the initialization of the struct. Why do I keep getting an error when I try to compile this code?</p>  <pre><code>main.c: In function 'main': main.c:16:23: error: expected expression before '{' token   fooPerson.fullname = {"Foo", 'B', "Baz"}; </code></pre>  <p>Â </p>  <pre><code>#define LEN 20  struct names {     char first[LEN];     char middle;     char last[LEN]; };  struct person {     struct names fullname; };  int main() {     struct person fooPerson;     fooPerson.fullname = {"Foo", 'B', "Baz"};      // NOT this: it works, but not the solution I'm asking for     // struct person fooPerson = {{"Foo", 'B', "Baz"}}; } </code></pre>
