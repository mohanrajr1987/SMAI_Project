<p>Given a sequence, I was wondering how to find duplicates using <strong>ONLY</strong> for loops (no imported modules, sorting functions, and etc.) in Python. Here's my following code that involves nested for loops so far:</p>  <pre><code>def has_duplicates(list):     x = 0     ans = False     for i in range(len(list)):         index = i         for object in list:             x = object         if list[i] == x:             ans = True             break     return ans </code></pre>  <p>I really do not know what to code for the inner loop... Are nested loops even necessary to find the duplicates of a sequence?</p>  <p>Examples of following outputs:</p>  <pre><code>list = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] print(ans) False list = "Hello" print(ans) True </code></pre>
