<p>I am trying to extract the values in the <strong><em>(...)</em></strong> , which may or may not be multiline. And I am using <strong><em>"nested ("</em></strong> in the regular expression. But it does not work as expected. For simplicity, I changed the regular expression as below;</p>  <p>Code snippet for your reference;</p>  <pre><code>RE_MULTI_LINE_PARAMS = ".*" RE_M_DECLERATION = r"\(%s\)"%RE_MULTI_LINE_PARAMS ... # read file fh = open(fname) fcontent = fh.read() patternList = re.findall(RE_M_DECLERATION, fcontent, re.VERBOSE) print patternList </code></pre>  <p>In other case, I use;</p>  <pre><code>RE_MULTI_LINE_PARAMS = "(.*)" </code></pre>  <p>rest of the code as above. But I see difference in the resultant list.</p>  <p>Probably, some one can explain, "why it behaves?" so or "how the nested bracket works in regular expression?"</p>
