<p>I am trying to implement inner hits with elasticsearch using the java api, but I cannot find much of any documentation on it or examples that other people are using.  I have my JSON search that works as follows:</p>  <pre><code>{   "query": {     "filtered": {       "query": {         "match_all": {}       },       "filter": {         "nested": {           "path": "locations",           "filter": {             "geo_distance": {               "distance": "20km",               "locations.address.geoLocation": {                 "lat": 38.07061,                 "lon": -76.77514               }             }           },           "inner_hits": {}         }       }     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>I see an InnerHitsBuilder and addInnerHit methods in the elasticsearch library but I cannot find the documentation on how to use them.  </p>  <p>Any help or pointers are appreciated,</p>  <p>Jason</p>
