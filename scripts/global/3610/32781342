<p>I have the following issue in Outlook 2010: A big table, wich has three columns (20px, 560px, 20px), <strong>each of them having an independent nested table</strong> (left: images 1700px high, middle: images 364px high, right: images 1700px high). </p>  <p>At the point where the first image of the left column table ends, the content of the middle column table gets pushed down until the beginning of the next left tables image.</p>  <p>The HTML code can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/richterd/00a145b25a5c77feadcb" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/richterd/00a145b25a5c77feadcb</a></p>  <p>The resulting Email looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9FiOQ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9FiOQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I marked the left column image so that you can see where the row of the left table ends. I would expect that the middle table's image comes directly after the one before. Does anyone have an idea what happens here?</p>  <p>Greetings, Daniel</p>
