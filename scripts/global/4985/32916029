<p>I wasn't sure where to turn with this question, so I hope someone here can point me in the right direction.</p>  <p>Images on my WordPress site have been excruciatingly slow to load recently.  While the gallery thumbnails appear just fine on the blog post, the lightbox image may take up to 30 seconds to appear.  In some instances, the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) appears to hang.</p>  <p>This has only recently become an issue, but I can't seem to figure out why.</p>  <p>You can see an example of this behaviour at: <a href="http://marcandrecossette.com/2015/09/27/muslim-leaders-hope-to-boost-voter-turnout/" rel="nofollow">http://marcandrecossette.com/2015/09/27/muslim-leaders-hope-to-boost-voter-turnout/</a></p>  <p>I'd appreciate any assistance you can provide.</p>  <p>Cheers.</p>
