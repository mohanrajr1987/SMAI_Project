<p>The code I’m working with is too long to post, so I’ve made a fiddle here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Emily92/5b72k225/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/Emily92/5b72k225/</a></p>  <p>This code takes a random image and cuts it up into a number of pieces depending on the class that is applied in the div which contains the image.</p>  <p>When the page loads, a random image is selected from the array and the class is applied to it, what I’m trying to do is create a separate div, which when clicked on will reload the div containing the image. The result I’m looking for is for the image to be replaced by a new random image with the class applied to it. </p>  <p>Right now, the only way I can make a new image appear in the div is to reload the entire page, ideally this would be achieved by just having the div reload instead of all the other page elements reloading too.</p>  <p>I haven’t been able to do this so far but have received some help on here on how to reload an image and class on click of a div, lines 980-1018 of the Javascript code in the jsfiddle is the current attempt at achieving this, but solving this problem seems much more complicated as the image is being manipulated by the Javascript code, so perhaps this needs to also be reloaded at the same time as the new randomised image is selected? </p>  <p>This is the current attempt at solving this problem:</p>  <pre><code>$(function() {     var imageArray = [     'http://www.webdesignhot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/CatsVectorImage.jpg',     'http://www.costume-works.com/images/halloween_cat_in_witch_hat.jpg',     'http://onthewight.com/wp-content/2013/04/sooty-ryde.jpg'];     reloadImages(imageArray);     $('#reload').on('click',function(){         $( "#masterdiv img[id^='div']" ).each(function(index){             $(this).removeClass("jqPuzzle jqp-r"+(index+3)+"-c"+(index+3)+"-SCN");             $(this).fadeOut( "slow", function() {                 if(index==0) {                     reloadImages(imageArray);                 }                 $(this).addClass("jqPuzzle jqp-r"+(index+3)+"-c"+(index+3)+"-SCN");                 $(this).fadeIn();              });         });     }); });   function shuffleArray(array) {     for (var i = array.length - 1; i &gt; 0; i--) {         var j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));         var temp = array[i];         array[i] = array[j];         array[j] = temp;     }     return array; }  function reloadImages(array){     shuffleArray(array);     for(var i=0;i&lt;3;i++){         // places the first image into all divs         document.getElementById('div'+(i+1)+'id').src=array[0];     } } </code></pre>  <p>I’ve written more details on the issue in the html section of the jsfiddle. I'd really appreciate any advice in solving this and thank you for any help in advance!</p>
