<p>I'm very new at this.</p>  <p>In my searching for the process in doing this correct I ran into a few things that I don't have access to. I want to obtain the JSON of a image website that has a particular type of images and I want to have them streamed to my app. </p>  <p>That is the simplified explanation of what I'm trying to accomplish. What I know now in being a beginner is that I have to have an API Key and a JSON I believe.</p>  <p>If I'm not getting the concept of this please correct me, but the question here is how can I get the these certain images on my app from the internet from a location that I create? This is the only option I can think of from already searching for a image hosting site that contains only the images I want in my app.</p>
