<p>I am quite a UX junkie and so far have been able to order, defer, async javascript. But the thing with image is I don't know how to paint it following the order I want. </p>  <p>So for example I want the background to be painted first before any other things. How do I achieve that? Because now the order of image is very random. </p>  <p>Please help. Thank you.</p>
