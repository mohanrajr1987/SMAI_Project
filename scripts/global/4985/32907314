<p>The code is:</p>  <pre><code>import pyautogui startButton = pyautogui.locateOnScreen('start.png') print startButton </code></pre>  <p>Or:</p>  <pre><code>import pyautogui startButton = pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen('start.png') print startButton </code></pre>  <p>The output is: </p>  <pre><code>None </code></pre>  <p>Note: the correct syntax seems to be in place according to the <a href="http://pyautogui.readthedocs.org/en/latest/screenshot.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>  <p>Note: I have tried also with image full path. The image is on the screen and it is not overlapped by other images. The pil library is also installed. Other <code>pyautogui</code> features work (including taking screenshot)</p>  <p>Please let me know what I am missing out. Or please suggest another Python library for image detection.</p>
