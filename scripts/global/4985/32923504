<p>I have the Android project in which I should implement infinite ViewPager with images from my server side. Also, ViewPager should store state, so I will be able to return to previous images. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to implement all that stuff.</p>  <p>Should I upload images in advance for more smoothly work and how should it be done? Can I use some ready solutions as Picasso for this purpose?</p>  <p>Will be better to use some library for infinite ViewPager or just implement with one's own hands?</p>  <p>What would be good to use and how this project should be organized? </p>
