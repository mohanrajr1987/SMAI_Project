<p>The problem is the following: I have a position of lets say a spaceship and the position has to be defined in the middle of it (e.g. because of collision issues etc.). If the Spaceship would not be rotated, the image would be drawn like this:</p>  <p><code>spaceship.draw(xPos - width/2 , yPos - height/2);</code></p>  <p>The Spaceship is now Image in Slick2D, that has a random angle (0 &lt;= angle &lt;360), and still the position has to be defined at it's center. What slick does in the draw()-methods is the following:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NrJBK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NrJBK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> It draws an oval around the image (i guess with the smallest possible surface area) and then looks where the line from the center at 135Â° off cuts the ellipse (red point) and sets that as position.</p>  <p>I still want to draw it centered, that means, i have to subract a value in both dimensions (<code>draw(xPos - xOff, yPos - yOff)</code>):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J1WvQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J1WvQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But im unabled to calculate that! Can someone help me please? I wasted two days to understand what the problem is...</p>  <p>Thanks a lot and Greets, r</p>
