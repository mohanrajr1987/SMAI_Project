<p>Ive been at this for a while but cant seem to crack it in swift</p>  <p>I want a user to be able to select an image in uicollectionView and for that image to appear in a detailed view controller, i can do this quite easily with a peice of text, and i can do this when there is a static array of images preloaded. but i cant seem to get anywhere with a collectionview which is loaded with images from a camera.</p>  <p>I understand i need to use</p>  <pre><code>override func performSegueWithIdentifier(identifier: String, sender: AnyObject?) {   } </code></pre>  <p>and this function to isolated selected cell.</p>  <pre><code>  func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, didDeselectItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) {   } </code></pre>  <p>I do have these outlets       @IBOutlet weak var collectionView: UICollectionView!</p>  <pre><code>  var images = [UIImage]() </code></pre>  <p>image picker stores all images to this array by</p>  <pre><code>  images.insert(newImage, atIndex: 0) </code></pre>  <p>when the array would be passed to the detailviewcontroller, i understand that would have to be copied into another local array and then how would i get the current image that was highlighted to be shown first, perhaps using indexPath.Row</p>  <p>Regards</p>
