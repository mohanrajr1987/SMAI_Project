<p>I m making a website . I want a button which when pressed opens up the image gallery and one can select the image he or she wants and it will get uploaded to a server .. I have done this for laptop and pc . Its working fine but with android it opens file manager instead of image gallery . I want to open image gallery just like whatsapp where we can add attachments . I want tht image to be uploaded on my server . </p>
