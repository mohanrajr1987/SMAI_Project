<p>I am trying to get a title to display over an image and have it center horizontally and vertically using display:table-cell. </p>  <p>A specific example is <a href="http://ollymoss.com" rel="nofollow">http://ollymoss.com</a> - how, on hover, the title of each poster comes up and is centered vertically/horizontally. I inspected element and saw they were using Display: Table-cell but I can't replicate it. </p>  <p>If anyone happens to know a way to make this work, that would be great! </p>  <p>This is the page in question: <a href="http://sathyaram.com/graphic" rel="nofollow">http://sathyaram.com/graphic</a></p>  <p>I'm trying to get those titles for each tile to appear ON the tile, centered vertically/horizontally. </p>  <p>If there's a better method than display:table-cell, I would love to know! I know you can use position:absolutes/relatives, but I would like it to be responsive and I'm not sure how that'd work!</p>  <p>I'm trying to do this specifically within CSS - not sure how to use jQuery!</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
