<p>I have a image in the size of 1024x768 and I have the same image in small resolution of 400x300. I am using the small image for cropping. So, user can crop the small image and I can get the cropping coordinates for the small image. I need to crop the same position in the large size image. I need to calculate the cropping position from the small image. How can I calculate this in PHP? The cropping position will not change in both images.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
