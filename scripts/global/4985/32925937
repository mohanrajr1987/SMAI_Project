<p>Bootstrap 3.  I am adding an image (Logo) and want it responsive. So the natural state is 100% width. I want it to stay the same relative size to the Text next to it in different browser widths. Is this possible or do you have to adjust size with more breakpoints? In other words say from lg to md I can get the right size and position but if the monitor they have is over the breakpoint at 1200px like 1400px the image or logo ends up way to large but the text flows right in the row next to it and in tablet size the med width I can get it set right for the breakpoint but if someone has a 50px smaller size screen than an iPad then it will look to big. Any suggestions?</p>
