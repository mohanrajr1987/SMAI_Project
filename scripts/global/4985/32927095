<p>I have a pdf file created with itextsharp with images in the file. I would like to put a hyperlink in the file that if you pick the picture it will open that picture in a picture viewer. I can set a hyperlink to a web address but have no idea how to get it to open a file.  Below is the code, yes I know that c:\test.jpg is a bad hardcoded file name but it is just a test. When you click the picture it does nothing but I have no idea how to tell it what to do.</p>  <pre><code>iTextSharp.text.Image pic =TextSharp.text.Image.GetInstance(comment.examplePic); pic.ScaleToFit(200f, 200f); Chunk cImage = new Chunk(pic, 0, 0, false); Anchor anchor = new Anchor(cImage); anchor.Reference = "c:\\test.jpg"; doc.Add(pic); doc.Add(anchor); </code></pre>
