<p>I'm having problems trying to get a php script to output an image file. Ultimately, I will be locating the images outside the web root, for access across a few domains, however that isn't the problem.</p>  <p>Although I can locate the images easily, the problem is that I can only retrieve raw data.</p>  <p>I have a main html page .. page.php</p>  <pre><code>&lt;img src="imagelocator.php"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This is imagelocator.php</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $file = '/homepages/31/d30620165/htdocs/CommonFiles/images/a2.jpg'; header('Content-type: image/jpeg'); readfile($file); #  readfile($file); #  print file_get_contents($file); #  echo file_get_contents($file); #  include($file); #  echo imagejpeg($file); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>From the main page, I get nothing atall, but by going directly to imagelocator.php I get the raw data (I assume it is raw data, it starts like ����JFIFHH���Photoshop 3.08BIM�x )</p>  <p>As you can see from the uses of #, I have tried many methods of getting the image, ('include' gave an error at line 116, and 'echo file_get_contents' gave me nothing. The other four methods all produced the raw data (in all cases page.php came back with nothing)</p>  <p>Im thinking that the problem is either in the content type or the method of retreival. I have tried alternate image types eg .gif but it makes no difference.</p>  <p>It's been driving me up the wall for a couple of days now, so if anyone can show me where I'm going wrong that would be great.</p>  <p>Many thanks.</p>  <p>Additional Info requested for .htaccess file(s) in my root directory (htdocs) i have this .htaccess</p>  <pre><code>    Options +Includes </code></pre>  <p>In my domain directory (wwwfiles) i have this .htaccess</p>  <pre><code>    Options +FollowSymLinks      RewriteEngine on     RewriteBase /     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(gif)$      RewriteRule .* images/noimage.gif [L]     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(jpg)$      RewriteRule .* images/imageunavailableMS.gif [L]     Options +Includes     ErrorDocument 400 /400-500.shtml     ErrorDocument 401 /401-403.shtml     ErrorDocument 403 /401-403.shtml     ErrorDocument 404 /404.shtml     ErrorDocument 500 /400-500.shtml </code></pre>  <p>thanks</p>
