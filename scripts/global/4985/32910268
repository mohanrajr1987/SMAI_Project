<p>I've been working on a set of biological pictures, and I'm trying to develop an algorithm, which would follow and note position of black dots on white background. I'm competent in Java and python, are there any libraries, which might help me?</p>  <p>My plan was to somehow grasp the RGB composition of specific pixles and then find it on the next picture and map coordinates. Does this make sense?</p>  <p>Thanks for help.</p>
