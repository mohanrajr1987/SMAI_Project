<p>I'm designing a website for a printing company. They want an image size/resolution checker that will let their customers upload an image they want to print, and tell them if the image resolution is good enough for printing.</p>  <p>I'm using Adobe Muse, so I need a simple HTML and CSS solution to this without any server-side requirements.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far, based on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13572129/is-it-possible-to-check-dimensions-of-image-before-uploading">this question</a>:</p>  <pre><code>window.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL; $("form").submit(function(e) {     var form = this;     e.preventDefault(); //Stop the submit for now     //Replace with your selector to find the file input in your form var    fileInput = $(this).find("input[type=file]")[0];    file = fileInput.files &amp;&amp; fileInput.files[0];    if (file) {        var img = new Image();        img.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(file);          img.onload = function() {             var width = img.naturalWidth, height = img.naturalHeight;             window.URL.revokeObjectURL( img.src );             if( width == 400 &amp;&amp; height == 300 ) {                 form.submit();             } else {                  //stop             }          };      } else {         //No file was input or browser doesn't support client side reading         form.submit();     } }); </code></pre>  <p>However, I don't get any popup message. What am I doing wrong?</p>
