<p>I have two FormViews in a TabContainer. I modify values in either/both of them. And then I Update using the following sequence:</p>  <ol> <li>Open and Begin two transactions (one for each FormView)</li> <li>In Try block, ExecuteNonQuery() once for each FormView</li> <li>Commit() once for each FormView</li> <li>In Catch block, if Commit() fails then Rollback() both transactions</li> <li>In Finally block, regardless, Close() both transactions</li> </ol>  <p>First time all updates are successful. But Second time identical updates fail to Commit for no apparent reason.</p>  <p>Is there some cleanup I need to do after commit to remedy this?  Or am I missing something very obvious?!</p>
