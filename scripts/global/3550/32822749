<p>I have a big ASP.NET transaction, with many operations. (using sql server)</p>  <ul> <li>Transaction started</li> <li>Application updates a table (Let's name it T1)</li> <li>Application performs some other actions</li> <li>Application calls a webservice (which performs many actions)</li> <li>Application Calls a 2nd webservice</li> <li>On the 2nd webservice, I need to read from T1, and I'm getting a deadlock since the transaction was not commited yet</li> </ul>  <p>How can I solve this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
