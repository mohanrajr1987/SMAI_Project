<p>I am using transaction in controller. I works fine when I use it in model as:</p>  <p><em>Model</em></p>  <pre><code> $this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_start();  //insert active record query  $this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_complete();  $this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_status(); </code></pre>  <p>But I want to use it in controller so that I can call multiple model. But its not working.</p>  <p><em>Controller</em></p>  <pre><code> $this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_start();  //insert user and return last inserted id as $id.  $userinfo = $this-&gt;dbuser-&gt;get_info($id);  foreach($userinfo as $info){       $useremail = $info-&gt;email;  }  $this-&gt;dbmedia-&gt;set_tbl($useremail);  $this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_complete();  $this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_status(); </code></pre>  <p>I am using multiple model's method to insert user info and again get last inserted id from user table and again get email based from that id and insert to another table media. I want mysql to follow automicity for my all query. How can I achieve this using transaction in controller. I found accepted answers in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12246666/codeigniter-one-transaction-with-two-model">SO question</a>. But none of them worked for me. Does codeigniter really support this or I am doing it wrong. </p>
