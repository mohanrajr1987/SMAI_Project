<p>I'm trying to use a transaction process with a wizard in apex 5.0. I want to register a new Student to the database, so in the first page of the wizard I want to create a savepoint (s1) then insert the information of the  student into the table "STUDENT", and in the second page I want to insert the info of the student's superior.<br> what I want to do is when the user click the Previous button, I want to rollback to savepoint s1 and undo the insert statement.<br> I tried to create a process but it seems that the rollback statement in the second page can't see the savepoint I declared in the first page. so, does any one can help with that?</p>
