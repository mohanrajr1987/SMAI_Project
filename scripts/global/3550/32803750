<p>I am currently setting up a checkout for my website. I have a product that I offer options that vary in price and I'd like to have a price preview at the end before the customer decides to pay. I have a checkout modal and ideally I'd want to have the price preview reflect the final price of the product after everything is taken into account. The math is done server side on php, how do I echo or display the variables back into the html page without reloading after pressing a button?</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;?php //sets price based on options selected// $ord_type_explode =  explode('|',$_POST['ord_type']); $base_price = $ord_type_explode[1];  $item_options_explode = explode('|',$_POST['item_options']); $options_add = $item_options_explode[1];  $quantity_select_explode = explode('|',$_POST['quantity_select']); $quantity_multiplier = $quantity_select_explode[1];  $final_price = ($base_price + $options_add) * $quantity_multiplier;  echo $final_price;    ?&gt; </code></pre>
