<p>I'm trying to rollback the whole translaction in MySQL. I'm using savepoints, like the following:</p>  <pre><code>START TRANSACTION SAVEPOINT SP_0 DELETE FROM my_table INSERT INTO my_table ... INSERT INTO my_table ... INSERT INTO my_table ... SAVEPOINT SP_1 INSERT INTO my_table ... INSERT INTO my_table ... SAVEPOINT SP_2 ROLLBACK </code></pre>  <p>Starting <strong>with <code>my_table</code> empty</strong>, ROLLBACK doesn't undo the insert statements.</p>  <p>How this is possible? From MySQL documentation:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>All savepoints of the current transaction are deleted if you execute a COMMIT, > or a ROLLBACK that does not name a savepoint.</p> </blockquote>
