<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)" rel="nofollow">wiki Isolation</a> section "Isolation Levels vs Lock Duration" describes that isolation level determines the duration that locks are held, e.g. on <code>read uncommitted</code> the locks are held only during the currently executing statement then released after the statement is executed. </p>  <p>On MySQL, the acquired locks are always held until the transaction commits or rolls back, aren't they? Examples from other systems in accordance with the above wiki description are welcome.</p>
