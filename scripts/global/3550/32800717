<p>I am trying to understand the event where a lock in mysql is created. I have a number of INSERT queries (say 50 queries) to run upon a mysql db. It's likely that some of these queries are run with different java.sql.Connection objects, and some of them failed due to deadlocks.</p>  <p>I am trying to understand, <strong>if a lock is created per transaction, or per query</strong>? If per query, an easy fix would be to group all the 50 INSERT queries into a single transaction.</p>
