<p>I have two WARs running on the same tomcat server, both using Spring transactions and both writing to the same database. They communicate with each other through REST calls.</p>  <p>Now I have a business process that starts from <code>foo.war</code>, which calls <code>bar.war</code>, then returns back to <code>foo.war</code>. Both of them write to the same database, but they currently are not part of one transaction, so if <code>foo.war</code> fails to commit, <code>bar.war</code> doesn't rollback.</p>  <p>How can I solve this problem without integrating one war into the other? </p>  <p>I though a standalone JTA implementation might work, but since they are different applications, I'm not sure if it will.</p>
