<p>I am performing several <code>SqlBulkCopy</code>'s in a single transaction, I need to be able to roll back easily if anything goes wrong. I'm bulk copying several tables that have foreign keys to each other. I want these constraints checked. I'm copying the parent table first, then the child tables, but I'm receiving foreign key constraint errors. Does <code>SqlBulkCopy</code> include the rows inserted in the transaction when checking constraints?</p>
