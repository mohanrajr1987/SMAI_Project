<p>i am using angularjs and UI route, for routing i also use resolver pass data to controller But some time translation are not loaded properly they show string which is used in stored localization.</p>  <p>this are loaded in <code>app.run()</code> using <code>$translateProvider.useUrlLoader('api/url')</code></p>  <p>i wont wait for complete above api call then go to next task</p>  <p>in run function we also load user right's using api call but some time this collection come empty. So how we wait apply in run function </p>
