<p>When refreshing one workspace from another one using Oracle Workspace Manager, you can notice conflicts in the xxx_CONF tables. That's fine for technical (i.e. row-based) conflicts. Now, what about business conflicts? I have a set of business rules implemented in the logic of my application (and not as DB constraints). They prevent a user from entering "invalid" information into the DB .  Now, you can have two workspaces that are both consistent (as defined by the above rules) on their own. But their combination may be inconsistent, although the corresponding refresh operation would produce no conflict in the xxx_CONF tables.  How do you make sure that a refresh does not "corrupt" your data? Do you check all the DIFFs against the business rules prior to starting the refresh and ask a user to manually solve the identified conflicts? If you have a lot of rules, this might be a daunting task. </p>  <p>Or do you go ahead with the refresh and let your user repare the inconsistent data set? In the meantime, your application has to deal with data it would have never have let in in the first place. That means that the code of the entire application has to become very tolerant for a while. Sounds like bad design to me.</p>  <p>Any other (and hopefully smarter) idea?</p>  <p>Looking forward to your suggestions, Christophe</p>
