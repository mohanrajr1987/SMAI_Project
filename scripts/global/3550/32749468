<p>Lets say I have a table(Table1) with a Value field that has value=0.</p>  <p>Then two users(USER1 and USER2) run the transaction below concurrently</p>  <pre><code>BEGIN   UPDATE Table1 SET Value=Value+1;    UPDATE Table1 SET StatusField='Y' WHERE Value=2;  COMMIT; </code></pre>  <p>If the command is executed in the following order</p>  <p>USER1 starts transaction</p>  <p>USER2 start transaction</p>  <p>USER1 ends transaction;</p>  <p>USER2 ends transaction;</p>  <p>Will statusfield be set to Y?</p>  <p>NB! This is not a real life example, you should probably never want to use code like this, but I'm only trying to understand how transactions work. In other words what I want to know is, if two transactions starts at the same time and one of them finishes will the transaction already started know about the changes made by the first transaction?</p>
