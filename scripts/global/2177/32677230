<p>I'm changing the datetime format of the timestamps shown on my app. I'm calling <code>Model.created_at</code> or <code>Model.updated_at</code> methods, which by default is displayed in the following format:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 06:58:49 UTC +00:00</p> </blockquote>  <p>But I want to get the result in a custom format, for example:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>20/09/2015 06:58</p> </blockquote>  <p>I know that is possible to edit default locales format for time at:</p>  <pre><code>time:   formats:     default: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M" </code></pre>  <p>But that means I have to call <code>localize</code> method each time one of these timestamps appears and that change on views will take me too much time.</p>  <p>There is some elegant solution to make this possible?</p>  <p>Sorry for my english and thanks for any help.</p>
