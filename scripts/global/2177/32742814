<p>I'm looking to understand that while I'm generating keytab file. it's being showed wrong timestamp 1970. I'm unsure about it how to get bottom of it. In order to understand cause of it, I did intensive search in google to know the cause of it. but unfortunately there is no such info exist. However, I managed to draw out few lines but I'm unable to make out of it. </p>  <p>"the windows KTPASS command, using the DES encryption sets the timestamp on the first unix date: 1/1/1970. the kerberos standard tool KTUTIL sets the correct time stamp (creation timestamp). if the keytab is created with a correct timestamp, the SSO autentication DOESN'T work"  </p>
