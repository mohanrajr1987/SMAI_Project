<p>I am looking to generate continuation series of numbers between 1834292860000395154018 and 1834456370000677465822. This must be arbitrary numbers which are mostly not supported by PHP I guess. Correct me if I am wrong. </p>  <p>Example.  1834292860000395154018 1834292860000395154019 1834292860000395154020</p>  <p>I tried doing it with xrange, but doesnt workout. </p>  <p>The above numbers are Unknown Timestamps.</p>
