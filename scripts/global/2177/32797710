<pre><code>function timestamp() { return new Date() } </code></pre>  <p>The function recalculates every-time i open the sheet. i only want it to recalculate on edit. I have tried to mess with "onEdit" but i can never get it to work. I have also tried the "current project triggers" but that doesn't seem to fix the problem. I apologize that for the simplicity of the question, I simply can't find or figure out the answer.
