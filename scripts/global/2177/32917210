<p>I am having a project where I have a time duration for a certain service which I have converted to strtotime and also, I have a datetime picker which I have converted to strtotime, So in my data base, so, I am using a calendar from <a href="https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE</a>,</p>  <p>now, here is my problem, in the calendar sample there is the code </p>  <pre><code> {                         title: 'Long Event',                         start: new Date(y, m, d - 5),                         end: new Date(y, m, d - 2),                         backgroundColor: "#f39c12", //yellow                         borderColor: "#f39c12" //yellow                     }, </code></pre>  <p>what I am trying to accomplish is that from the service duration,let's say the duration is 2 hours converted strtotime, how can i add it to the timestamp of datetime? These is my code and screenshot below, as you can see, the result is very wrong since my appoint_end is only 2 hours but the appointment is displayed for days,<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V8THR.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V8THR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>events:     [     &lt;?php $event_query = mysql_query("select * from appointment,service,user where appointment.user_id = user.user_id and service.service_id = appointment.service_id")or die(mysql_error());           while($event_row = mysql_fetch_array($event_query)){           $e = $event_row['appoint_date'];           $ee = $event_row['appoint_end'];           $eee = $e + $ee;     ?&gt;     {         title  : '&lt;?php echo $event_row['firstname'].' '.$event_row['lastname']; ?&gt; ',         start  : '&lt;?php echo $event_row['appoint_date']; ?&gt;',         end: '&lt;?php echo  $eee; ?&gt;',         allDay: false,         backgroundColor: "#3c8dbc", //Primary (light-blue)         borderColor: "#3c8dbc" //Primary (light-blue)     },     &lt;?php } ?&gt;     ], </code></pre>  <p>the start date is ok, just the end, since i only added 2 hours from service timestamp to datetime timestamp, what to do?</p>
