<p><em>(Related <a href="http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3657/an-argument-for-the-unix-specific-programming-questions-site-quality">post</a> on meta)</em></p>  <p>As we can see in signal (7), <code>gettimeofday()</code> isn't a reentrant function, thus it can't be used in signal handlers.</p>  <p>But I want to get the clock on a posix-conform way - for timestamping from signal handlers - which is more accurate as a second.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do it?</p>
