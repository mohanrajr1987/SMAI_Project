<p>I've read this questions and trying to use in my scenario.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19843203/how-to-store-a-datetime-in-mysql-with-timezone-info">How to store a datetime in MySQL with timezone info</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2532729/daylight-saving-time-and-time-zone-best-practices">Daylight saving time and time zone best practices</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24719068/storing-time-in-database-for-users-in-different-time-zones">storing time in database for users in different time zones</a></p>  <p>we have an event system.. Where user can create event from any place and this created events can be seen by any user in the world as it will be open for all. There will be no relational time like ( 1 min ago , few seconds ago) we are providing real times with date and time like 09-22-2015 12:23:45 to show for event start time and event end time. There can be situation where event from New York can be seen by user from London. So how should i store timings of event start time and end time and what should i use to show them as start time and end time to users of different time zone. </p>  <p>And there will be also user actions to event like they join, like , share , save  this events. So to the users of different timezones how should i store data in my MySql/PHP app. what should i use to save timings of all actions. </p>  <p>Like : Event created_time , event_start_time, event_end_time.  also for the user action on event i need to store time.  so when i show time it look accurate.</p>  <p>There will be users from different time zones who are creating events . How can handle all this scenario.</p>  <p><strong>actually right now we are using server system's datetime .. we use php's date function to store datetime in mysql. we store system's datetime. But it is wrong. And there can be problems in future if we stick to save datetime of the server system. and we do not want to be dependent of server . so need another way out.</strong></p>  <p>Actually right now confused which way to go... I've read answers but confused to which will fit my scenarioes. </p>  <p>Way 1 - Save timings of user's timezone . Means i have to save time and timezone of user. and show other user's on the basis of thier timezone. Now here what time i should use to show event timings of an event in NewYork to user in United Kingdom.</p>  <p>Way 2  - Use the timinigs of event Time as constants on depeneding on thier location . And for the actions like [like, save , share , join] i save timezone and time of the user's timezone.</p>
