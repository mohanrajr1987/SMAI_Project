<p>I'm uploading a datababase to MySQL and get this problem: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR 1293 (HY000) at line 31: Incorrect table definition; there can be only one TIMESTAMP column with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in DEFAULT or ON UPDATE clause</p> </blockquote>  <p>The problem is that of two columns with "Timestamp" data type in that table, only one should have "Current Timestamp" value, while the other default value is "null". When I upload the database, both columns' value get changed to "Current Timestamp", which makes the process of exporting and importing very annoying, since I have to manually change it back to null before importing again.</p>  <p>Any idea why it automatically changes to "current timestamp"? This is an Amazon EC2 linux instance (see attached mysql version)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XModw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XModw.png" alt="mysql version"></a></p>
