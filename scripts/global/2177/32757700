<p>I'am using <em>timestamp</em> data type on pg9.4, but there come very strange problem with to_json.</p>  <p>now i am in Shanghai, UTC+08:00 timezone.</p>  <p>see below:</p>  <pre><code>    conn.createStatement().execute("set time zone 'UTC'");      String sql = "select to_json(?::timestamp) as a, to_json(current_timestamp::timestamp) as b";     PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);     Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(new Date().getTime());           ps.setTimestamp(1, timestamp);      ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();     while(rs.next()){         System.out.println("a " + rs.getString("a") + ", b " + rs.getString("b"));     } </code></pre>  <p>output:     a "2015-09-24T16:52:42.529", b "2015-09-24T08:53:25.468191"</p>  <p>it's mean when i pass a TIMESTAMP parameter to pg with jdbc, the timezone is still in shanghai, not UTC.</p>  <p>this problem is not due to to_json function, i have make a table with one timestamp column, this problem still exits, the code of above is shortest sample.</p>  <p>how to let's all timestamp work in UTC timezone?</p>
