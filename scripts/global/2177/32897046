<p>I have a data frame and one column is time (stored as <code>Timestamps</code>) which are truncated to seconds. The events really occurred randomly, but always at distinct times. I'd like to adjust the times as follows. If a given <code>Timestamp</code> appears once, add half a second to it (e.g. 15:16:04 becomes 15:16:04.5). If it appears twice, and a quarter second to the first and three quarters to the second (e.g. 15:16:04 becomes 15:16:04.25 and 15:16:04.75). And so on (e.g. if 15:16:04 occurred three times, you'd end up 15:16:04 + 1/6, 15:16:04.5 and 15:16:04 + 5/6). What's the pandas idiomatic way to do this?</p>
