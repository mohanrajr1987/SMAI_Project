<p>I have a date timestamp column where the data is in this format - yyyymmddhhmmssED e.g. 20140617101703ED</p>  <p>I assume the ED designates Eastern Daylight? Regardless, I am unable to perform calculations like Datediff on columns like these. Shouldn't I be able to? If not, how can I format this column such that I will be able to perform calculations with it? I have tried cast, convert, left, but can't seem to get it :/</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
