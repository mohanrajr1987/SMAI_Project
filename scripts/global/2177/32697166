<p>Alright... I have here a query that calculates a server uptime and sometimes this uptime goes over 24 hours. I use basically</p>  <pre><code>select start, end, start-end as real_uptime from uptime </code></pre>  <p><code>start</code> and <code>end</code> being <code>timestamp with timezone</code> fields</p>  <p>Also, I have a stored function that sums all the <code>real_uptime</code> for a period and returns them...</p>  <p>However, I dumped the values <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> and put them into a spreadsheet and, doing the calculations there, the results had gone differently from what the stored function processed (the stored function returned lower values). I think that he ignores results for <code>real_uptime</code> bigger than one day. Postgresql shows them as <code>x days hh:mm:ss</code>... And I want them as <code>hh:mm:ss</code> (representing the total uptime in hours, <strong>without</strong> the full days counting.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
