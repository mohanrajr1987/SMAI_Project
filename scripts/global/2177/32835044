<p>I want to add timestamp (DD-MM-YYYY h:m:s) every time I write data to a CSV file. This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>def WriteListtoCSV(data):     with open ('tesdata.csv','a') as csvfile:         writer = csv.writer(csvfile)             for val in data:                 writer.writerow([val]) </code></pre>  <p>In every write row I want to write TimeStamp in column 1 and data in column 2.</p>
