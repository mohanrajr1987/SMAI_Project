<p>Sounds easy but I didn't manage though ...</p>  <p>I'd like to prefix the output of a command (which is returning several lines) with the date/time the line is generated. To simplify here, I use the ls as an example. The real command is too lengthy.</p>  <p>The <code>ls</code> command says:</p>  <pre><code>root@gan:~/test# ls -l total 0 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 23 08:54 file_a -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 23 08:54 file_b -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 23 08:54 file_c </code></pre>  <p>This was as far as I got ...</p>  <pre><code>root@gan:~/test# ls -l | awk -v var=$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S") '{ print var " " $0 }' 20150923-102310 total 0 20150923-102310 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 23 08:54 file_a 20150923-102310 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 23 08:54 file_b 20150923-102310 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 23 08:54 file_c </code></pre>  <p>As it is now, the date/time is the one when the <em>command is executed</em>, not updated per line <code>ls</code> command generates.</p>  <p>How can I modify this so that every line <code>ls</code> command generates is preceeded by the date/time the line is generated (as opposed to the date/time the command executed)?</p>  <p>Many thanks!</p>
