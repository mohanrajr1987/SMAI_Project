<p>I have a table with differents fields. Some are String, others are Timestamp(6) in DB. The issue is when I display data from this table, I got this for the Timestamp fields:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>15/12/10 00:03:00,000000000</p> </blockquote>  <p>I would like to store and display only hour like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>00:03:00</p> </blockquote>  <p>Nothing else. I retrieve the data from DB via a web method in java. I'm using Hibernate with DAO pattern.</p>  <p>What changes I have to do ?  There is a method to extract only hour maybe ?</p>  <p>Thanks !</p>
