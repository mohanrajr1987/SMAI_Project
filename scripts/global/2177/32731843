<p>I am working with <strong>PostgreSQL 8.4.4</strong>. My problem is, I am calculating time difference in days-hours-minuts from two bigint values. I am converting those values to timestamp and then calculating the difference. I am getting the difference for the values that are present in table. But for those that return <code>NULL</code> or not present in table, I want result as 'Missing'. When I add this in query, I get above error. Following is the query I am using:</p>  <pre><code>select     case when exists (SELECT age(to_timestamp(incepted_date), to_timestamp(invoice_pay_date))                      from transactions_transactions where id = 4275)     then (SELECT age(to_timestamp(incepted_date), to_timestamp(invoice_pay_date))                      from transactions_transactions where id = 4275)       else 'missing' end </code></pre>
