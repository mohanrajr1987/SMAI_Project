<p>As the title says.</p>  <p>From the database, in the resultset, I want those rows where the date and time <strong>(schedule column)</strong> are already passed.</p>  <p>In the database I have <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bz9AI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bz9AI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>On the PHP page I have:</p>  <pre><code>$now = time(); $result = $mysqli-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM schedules WHERE $now &gt;= UNIX_TIMESTAMP(schedule)"); </code></pre>  <p>However, if I test this on 2015-09-19 at 18:50:00, I get no results at all, while instead I should only get the row with ID 39.</p>  <p>As much as I know I am comparing two valid timestamps - the one generated by time() and the one converted from the database with UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - so what isn't working?</p>  <p>EDIT: I already tried to do $result = $mysqli->query("SELECT * FROM schedules WHERE NOW() >= schedule");</p>  <p>But with no luck. I am getting the results with</p>  <pre><code>while ($row = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()) {     $id = $row['ID'];     echo $id; } </code></pre>
