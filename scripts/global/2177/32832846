<p>I have a very long list of unix times (rounded to 10s) and I need to find the longest sequential sequence of timestamps 10s apart in that list.</p>  <pre><code>[1441831770.0, 1441831780.0, 1441831790.0, ... 1442466860.0, 1442466870.0, 1442466880.0] </code></pre>  <p>If I have a list of 100 timestamps and 60 of which are in a sequence 600 seconds long and then theres a 4 minute break followed by another 40 in a sequence 400 seconds long, I would return the 60 second long sublist of timestamps.</p>  <p>Is there an efficient way to do this? <code>itertools</code> or <code>numpy</code>? Or must it be hard coded?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
