<p>Im trying to debug Netezza procedure using RAISE NOTICE after UPDATE AND INSERT queries. Im trying to show the current time after each query is finished.  I tried something like this:</p>  <pre><code>RAISE NOTICE 'UPDATE time=%', now(); </code></pre>  <p>But that doesn't work. Only way I have had it working is to define a timestamp variable at the beginning of procedure and then just before raising notice I define this variablie like this:</p>  <pre><code>timevar:=now(); RAISE NOTICE 'UPDATE time=%', timevar; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way where I can combine it just in one line and not have to define a new variable at beginning of procedure and assining it  now() each time I whant to RAISE NOTICE ? </p>
