<p>I have an object that I read out of my DB like that:</p>  <pre><code>Bestellung bestellung = db.Bestellung.First(x =&gt; x.ID == id); </code></pre>  <p>Then I set in my object a nullabule timestamp to DateTime.Now (the timestamp is only to see if someone already called the object and when).after that I write it back to the DB with db.SaveChanges(). The result is that I get a validation Exception. I guess it has something to do with the fact that it is a nullubule timestamp but am not sure.</p>  <p>Does someone have an idear why it comes and how to fix it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
