<p>This is my query which is used for insert and selecting date format. This comes with milliseconds as <code>000000000</code>. But i dont need it. I need to show only date and time (<code>04-09-15 10:10:21</code>). How to handle it. Help me to solve it.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP( '20150924'||' '||TO_CHAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'HH24MISS'), 'YYYYMMDD HH24MISS') FROM DUAL; </code></pre>
