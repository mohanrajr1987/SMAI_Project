<p>I have a select command using substr which returns a list of numbers:</p>  <p><code>select substr(numbers,76,8) as num from numtab;</code></p>  <p>but when I try and run the following command to display records containing num in another table, I get 'single-row subquery returns more than one row'</p>  <pre><code>select names from namtab where FK_number = (select substr(numbers,76,8) as num from numtab); </code></pre>
