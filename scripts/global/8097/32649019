<p>I have two query with the same result, now I want to know which one is more optimized?</p>  <p><strong>In the SELECT</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>select t1.*, sum(t2.value) as total_votes from table1 t1 left join table2 t2 on t1.id = t2.post_id </code></pre>  <p><strong>In the SUB-SELECT:</strong></p>  <pre><code>select t1.*, t3.total_votes from table1 t1 left join (select post_id, sum(value) as total_votes from table2 t2 group by post_id) t3 on t1.id = t3.post_id </code></pre>  <p>It should be noted, I have two table: table1(posts), table2(votes). And the two above query are for calculating total votes for each post.</p>  <p>So, which one is faster and more optimized?</p>
