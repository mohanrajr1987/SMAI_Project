<p>I have an SQL query like this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_value FROM submissions WHERE username = (   SELECT username FROM submissions WHERE id = '1' ) AND number = (   SELECT number FROM submissions WHERE id = '1' ) AND tstmp &lt; (   SELECT tstmp FROM submissions WHERE id = '1' ); </code></pre>  <p>Notice how I am using this query to find all rows with similar column values, but with a timestamp value that is less than row number 1.</p>  <p>This works for me, but I was wondering, is there a way I could combine the three subqueries into one? They all select information from the same table, so I thought it might be possible, but I have no clue how to do it.</p>
