<p>My query works and is giving me correct results -- but it's ordering the two selects result sets separately and then concatenating the second result set to the end of the first and I don't know why! I want both sets to be ordered together.</p>  <pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>(SELECT      m.m_name AS 'Merchant',     log.ship_day AS 'Date',     log.num_orders AS '# Orders',     'Sales Exec' AS 'Dept',     CONCAT(ciii.i_fname, ' ', ciii.i_lname) AS 'Rep',     log.m_sales_executive_days AS 'Days',     CONCAT(log.m_sales_executive_level,             ' (',             log.m_sales_executive_com,             '*',             log.num_orders,             ')') AS 'Level',     log.m_sales_executive_payout AS 'Payout' FROM     commissions.commissions_log AS log         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.merchants m ON m.m_id = log.m_id         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.users uuu ON uuu.u_id = log.m_sales_executive         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.contact_info ciii ON uuu.u_i_id = ciii.i_id         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.users uuuu ON uuuu.u_id = log.m_account_manager         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.contact_info ciiii ON uuuu.u_i_id = ciiii.i_id)   UNION ALL   (SELECT      m.m_name AS 'Merchant',     log.ship_day AS 'Date',     log.num_orders AS '# Orders',     'Account Exec' AS 'Dept',     CONCAT(ciiii.i_fname, ' ', ciiii.i_lname) AS 'Rep',     log.m_account_manager_days AS 'Days',     CONCAT(log.m_account_manager_level,             ' (',             log.m_account_manager_com,             '*',             log.num_orders,             ')') AS 'Level',     log.m_account_manager_payout AS 'Payout' FROM     commissions.commissions_log AS log         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.merchants m ON m.m_id = log.m_id         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.users uuu ON uuu.u_id = log.m_sales_executive         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.contact_info ciii ON uuu.u_i_id = ciii.i_id         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.users uuuu ON uuuu.u_id = log.m_account_manager         LEFT JOIN     acf_rds_new.contact_info ciiii ON uuuu.u_i_id = ciiii.i_id)   ORDER BY 'Date' ASC , 'Merchant' ASC , '# Orders' DESC </code></pre>
