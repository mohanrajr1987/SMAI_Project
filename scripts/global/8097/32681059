<p>I have  the below code which returns the results as seen below (please note order method is only used so that I can sort the data)</p>  <pre><code>   Week_Variance_Range  Returns_Due ORDERMETHOD    Thisweek              11            05    -1                    11            02    -2                    12            03    -3                    5             04 </code></pre>  <p>Now this brings through all the data and I've just discovered that there are duplicated return ids (<code>RtnId</code>) yet my analysis requires distinct values.</p>  <p>So for <code>This week</code> lets say there have been 11 Returns. 2 may have come from the same return Id and as a result this week's figure should be 10 rather than 11.</p>  <p>Please see by code below: </p>  <pre><code>SELECT             Week_Variance_Range,      COUNT(*) AS Returns_Due,      CASE         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = 'Created This Week ' THEN '01'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-1' THEN '02'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-2' THEN'03'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-3' THEN '04'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-4' THEN '05'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-5' THEN '06'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-9 to - 6    ' THEN '07'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-19 to - 10  ' THEN '08'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-39 to - 20  ' THEN '09'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-59 to - 40  ' THEN '10'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-79 to - 60  ' THEN '11'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-99 to - 80  ' THEN '12'         WHEN t.Week_Variance_Range = '-500 to - 100 ' THEN '13'      END AS ORDERMETHOD FROM (     SELECT                CASE           WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 BETWEEN - 500 AND - 100 THEN '-500 to - 100 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 BETWEEN - 99 AND - 80 THEN '-99 to - 80 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 BETWEEN - 79 AND - 60 THEN '-79 to - 60 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 BETWEEN - 59 AND - 40 THEN '-59 to - 40 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 BETWEEN - 39 AND - 20 THEN '-39 to - 20 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 BETWEEN - 19 AND - 10 THEN '-19 to - 10 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 BETWEEN - 9 AND - 6 THEN '-9 to - 6 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 = - 5 THEN '-5 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 = - 4 THEN '-4 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 = - 3 THEN '-3 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 = - 2 THEN '-2 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 = - 1 THEN '-1 '            WHEN abs(DATEDIFF(WEEK, RtnDt, GETDATE())) * - 1 = 0 THEN 'Created This Week '         END AS Week_Variance_Range     FROM dbo.vw_AN_Admin_VendorReturns     WHERE (Complete &lt;&gt; 'X') ) AS t GROUP BY Week_Variance_Range ORDER BY ORDERMETHOD </code></pre>
