<p>My database contains docs with the below structure:</p>  <pre><code>{   "_id": "xx",   "_rev": "xx",   "metadata": [     {       "name": "par1",       "value": "val1"     },     {       "name": "par2",       "value": "val2"     },     {       "name": "par3",       "value": "val3"     },     {       "name": "par4",       "value": "val4"     }   ] } </code></pre>  <p>I want to run queries somethings like:</p>  <pre><code>{   "selector":    {     "metadata.name":"par1"    }  } </code></pre>  <p>but currently my above selector doesn't work. I have created a text type index for all the fields. basically I want to do the queried on sub-fields where sub-field itself is an object containing 2 data members "name" and "value". Any help or leads will be greatly appreciated.</p>
