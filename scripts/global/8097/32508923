<p>I've been stuck on this for a while and am hoping someone will be able to help.</p>  <p>I've made a simple mysql query (see below) which works fine but now I need to change it to retrieve additional data from other tables.</p>  <p>Here are my three tables:</p>  <p><strong>Member Table</strong></p>  <ul> <li>ID</li> <li>firstName</li> <li>lastName</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Certification Table</strong></p>  <ul> <li>ID</li> <li>memberID</li> <li>courseID</li> <li>certificationDate</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Course Table</strong></p>  <ul> <li>ID</li> <li>courseTitle</li> <li>level</li> </ul>  <p>There are a number of courses which members can take. When they do they get a certification which corresponds to the correct member and course.</p>  <p>Courses go up in levels.</p>  <p>I'm trying to list all my members and show their highest certification (according to it's level) and the course title for it.</p>  <p>Not all members have certifications but I still need to retrieve their data too.</p>  <p>I need to adjust the query below to include the user's highest certification and only the highest certification. I'm trying to avoid multiple certifications per member.</p>  <p>Any help would be amazing as I've been trying to solve this for ages. I've tried LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, subqueries and just can't get my head around it.</p>  <p>Thank you. </p>  <pre><code>// Member Query $tableMember = $wpdb-&gt;prefix . "dmc_diver"; $tableCertifications = $wpdb-&gt;prefix . "dmc_certifications"; $tableCourse = $wpdb-&gt;prefix . "dmc_course";  $memberQuery = $wpdb-&gt;get_results("      SELECT     ID,     firstName,      lastName      FROM      $tableMember  "); </code></pre>
