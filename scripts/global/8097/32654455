<p>In my query, I select a column which cannot exist because this column comes from a subquery in a join. (The subquery can give me 0 lines)</p>  <p>Consequently, in this case, I want to select 0 instead of "temp.Quantity" column.</p>  <p>The code:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT     bx.BX_BoxNum,     temp.Quantity    -- &lt;- this column FROM BOX bx INNER JOIN (SELECT BX_Id, SUM(BX_Quantity) AS Quantity FROM BOX             WHERE BX_Top_S = 'True' GROUP BY BX_Id) temp     ON bx.BX_Id = temp.BX_Id WHERE bx.BX_BoxNum = 10 </code></pre>  <p>Sometimes a box number is empty! And I try to have a line with "BOX nÂ°10 -- 0" instead of nothing</p>  <p>Could you please help me?</p>
