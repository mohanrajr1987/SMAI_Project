<p>I have a query, with a subquery, and subqueries in that. (i know, its not the most beautifull, but this is becouse of a script what has to get pk's from a excisting query). The first subquery itself, with the others in it, runs fast. Even though its selecting almost 4000 rows. But when i only add a query around it to select only the pk's, it turn into a monster query, its taking up to 15 minutes to perform then. We put neon profiler on it, and it gives us that the productwon/wincode subquery is taking much too long. We allready saw it ourselfs, becouse when leaving that one out, its fast. So it seems to turn out in a kind of loop hole. Does anyone knows why, or knows a trick to find out why the productwon/wincode subquery is taking so long when inside the outer query?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT pk FROM     (SELECT          pk,         responseset_pk,         responsedate,         (SELECT product FROM wincode wincodetable  WHERE wincodetable.product != '' AND  wincodetable.code =               (                 (SELECT value_text FROM responses ex3                     WHERE name = 'Wincode'                     AND (ex3.responseset_pk = ex.responseset_pk)                 )                  )         ) AS productwon,          (SELECT name FROM branch ex2 WHERE ex2.pk = ex.branch_pk) AS branchename      FROM responses ex     WHERE responses.question_pk = 1  ) t </code></pre>
