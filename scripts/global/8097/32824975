<p>I have a MySQL query to produce a view which displays two columns, the two columns are sub query's but for some reason I am getting error.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT  (SUM(cards_required) FROM `orders` WHERE statuses = 1) As Count, (SUM(cards_required) FROM `orders` WHERE statuses = 2) As Count FROM `orders` WHERE user_id = 1 </code></pre>  <p><strong>error message</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>#1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use   near 'FROM orders WHERE statuses = 1) As Count, (SUM(cards_required)   FROM orders ' at line 3</p> </blockquote>
