<p>I am trying to design a view on a MySQL database that stores information about football (soccer).</p>  <p>My goal is to create a view that returns all the goals and the basic information of the scorers. This is a simplified version of what the view used to look like:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT P.Name AS Player,        P.TeamName AS Team,        (SELECT COUNT(*)         FROM Goals G         WHERE G.Scorer = P.playerID) AS TotalGoals FROM Players P </code></pre>  <p>So far, everything's right. The problem started when I wanted to count goals only within a certain season, specified in the <code>WHERE</code> clause, as I show below:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM GoalsView WHERE Season = 1 </code></pre>  <p>And for it to return automatically only the count of the goals of the season in <code>WHERE</code> clause, as if the subquery was automatically edited to make it look like:</p>  <pre><code>[...] (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Goals G WHERE G.Scorer = P.playerID AND Season=1) AS TotalGoals [...] </code></pre>  <p>I hope I made myself clear. Thanks for your help!</p>
