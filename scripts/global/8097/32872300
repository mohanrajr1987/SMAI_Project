<pre><code>SELECT i.itemnumber,        i.quantity FROM items AS i JOIN item_index_info iio ON iio.child=iin.itemnumber JOIN item_types it ON it.itemnumber=iio.oparent WHERE it.type = "Toys"; </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible that i can add order by and limit to item_index_info table, so item_index_info table can have multiple entries of child as itemNumber but with different parents and different indexes so I would  like to select the first record i.e. the record with lowest index i.e. the immediate parent</p>  <p>I know this can be confusing, for table structure and example data please look at this question: </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32855822/how-to-do-multiple-joins-and-access-table-from-outer-query-from-subquery">How to do multiple joins and access table from outer query from subquery</a></p>
