<p>Table p SELECT p.OU_Dia, p.OU_Dia  FROM Parts p</p>  <p>--Table t SELECT t.Tool_OU_Dia,  t.Tool_IN_Dia, t.Tool_Num,t.derived_Math_Calc  FROM Tools t</p>  <p>I'd like to add correlated subquery a evaluate a mathematical function  for each row in Table P and the obtain t.Tool_Num and t.derived_Math_Calc</p>  <p>When I do join without any columns, I get all combination however I don't think it's  a smart way to do it and it may prone to problems.</p>  <p>Any idea to make this faster or alternative option other than using server side functions? I could not work correlated subquery work as two tables don't have distinct similar data where I can use a where clause.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
