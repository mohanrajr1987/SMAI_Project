<p>I tried googling this and couldn't think of a good search term. Thank you in advance. Would be great to know what type of "strategy" to use.</p>  <p>I would like to select data from a Book and for each book select the Tags that are associated to it </p>  <p>BUT my question is how do I "format" the select in a certain way. For example.</p>  <p>Schema: Books ----&lt; BooksTags >---- Tags</p>  <p><code>| id | book name      | tags                         | +----+----------------+------------------------------+ | 3  | Catcher In the | Fiction, Phoney,             | | 4  | Advanced PHP   | Technical, PHP, Non-Fiction  | | 6  | Calvin And Hob | Fiction, Comic, Funny        | +----+----------------+------------------------------+ </code></p>
