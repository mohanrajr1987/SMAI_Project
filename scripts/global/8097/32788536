<p>I'm wondering if it's possible to use a sub-selection as an exclusion query in orient db (v2.0). Or if it's necessary to export separate queries and process in Java/PHP/etc.</p>  <p>For instance, say we have the following graph for Hogwarts.</p>  <p>Vertices People, Houses, Classes</p>  <p>Edges is_at (subclasses is_student, is_faculty), was_at (alumni), is_taking, is_teaching, belongs_to</p>  <p>How would we find all the alumni who aren't also faculty? Is it possible to do so as a single query or using LET somehow?</p>  <p>How would we find all the faculty who are teaching a course on, say, time travel, that have no students who belong to the house gryffindor?</p>  <p>Thanks, Lindsay</p>
