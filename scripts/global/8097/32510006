<p>I have the following code which queries two databases (same schema, tied to the same application). One db holds service information, and the other transactions related to the service. The select is run in the transaction db. The output until "Volume of files/messages" is correct, but the select after that is returning a standalone value and not taking into consideration the main select. What is a workaround or the correct way to achieve the same for query 3 as it applies to the main select. I have included the output too. Thanks.</p>  <pre><code>select distinct tctc_cntipcli as "Type of contract" ,tctc_cncclipu as "Contract number", tctc_cndocidc as "Client name",   tsrv_cndesser as "Service name", tsrv_cncveser as "Service number", tsrs_cnsubsdc as "Subservice name", tsrs_cnsubser as "Subservice name", tmap_cndesc as "Map"   ,          (select count(tlof_cnlofrid)         from service.kndtlof         where tlof_cncclipu = tctc_cncclipu         and tlof_cnservic = tsrv_cncveser         and tlof_cnsubser = tsrs_cnsubser         and tlof_cnfhalta &gt; trunc (sysdate, 'mm')                             ) as "Volume of files/messages"                             ,                             (select count(app_data_id)                             from app_data ad, status ss, internal_transactions it, service.kndtexe ke, service.kndtctc kc, service.kndtsrv kv, service.kndtsrs ks                             where ad.int_tran_id = ss.int_tran_id                             and ss.int_tran_id = it.int_tran_id                             and                             (                               (it.credit_acct = ke.texe_cnasupro)                             or                               (it.debit_acct = ke.texe_cnasupro)                             )                             and ke.texe_cncclipu = kc.tctc_cncclipu                             and ke.texe_cnfuncid = kv.tsrv_cncveser                             and ke.texe_cnsubser = ks.tsrs_cnsubser                             and ad.entry_timestamp &gt; trunc (sysdate, 'mm')                              ) as "Volume of Payments"                            from service.kndtctc, service.kndtexe, service.kndtscm, service.kndtsrv, service.kndtsrs, service.kndtmap                           where tctc_cncclipu = texe_cncclipu                           and texe_cnfuncid = tsrv_cncveser                           and texe_cnfuncid = tsrs_cncveser                           and texe_cnsubser = tsrs_cnsubser                           and texe_cncclipu = tscm_cncontra                           and tscm_cnmapco = tmap_cnmapco                           and tscm_cnservic = tsrv_cncveser                           and tscm_cnsubser = tsrs_cnsubser                           and tctc_cnestado in ('01', '03')                           and texe_cnestado in ('01', '03')                           and tscm_cnestado in ('01', '03')                           and tsrv_cnestado in ('01', '03')                           and tsrs_cnestado in ('01', '03')                           and tmap_cnestado in ('01', '03')                           order by tctc_cncclipu                           ; </code></pre>  <p>And the output:</p>  <pre><code>Type of contract||Contract number||Client name||Service name||Service number||Subservice name||Subservice number||Map||Volume of files/messages||Volume of Payments C  50008753 Change Name  ACH  3085  ACH_IN1  I1  Sungard 820 ACH  31  16884  C  50008753 Change Name  ACH  3085  ACH_IN4  I4  Sungard 820 ACH  0   16884  C  50008753 Change Name  ACH  3085  ACH_OUT1 O1  827 NOC and Ret  1   16884  C  50008753 Change Name  ACH  3085  ACH_OUT4 O4  827 NOC and Ret  0   16884  </code></pre>  <p>Also, can i use the max function to only make the repeating fields appear once in the output. Those could be up to the first 5 elements in the main select based on ordering. Thanks for your time!</p>
