<p>This is difficult to explain so please bear with me: I'm trying to construct a mySQL query that will select the first record but then will not select another record until a certain requirement of difference has been met by an integer column.</p>  <p>e.g., if I the required difference was 10, the marked results should be selected from the following records:</p>  <pre><code>IntCol ------------------- 0 * 1  2 3 8 10 * 15 39 * 48 50 * 59 81 * 82 84 88 91 * 100 </code></pre>  <p>So basically, a record will only be selected if the previously selected record is at least 10 less than the current one. Nothing I have tried has been even remotely successful.</p>
