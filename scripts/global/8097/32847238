<p>Below is picture of two tables, owners and vehicles. I need to find out the owner who has all types of bikes.<br /> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F7rjS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F7rjS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> Example:  O_id 100,O_id 101,O_id 102 have bikes with V_id=1, but<br /> O_id 103 has all types of bikes(V_id = 1 and V_id = 5)<br /> How to write a query to get these details?<br /> My Query:</p>  <pre><code>select o.o_id from owner o,vehicles v where o.v_id = v.v_id where v_type = 'bike' </code></pre>  <p>this is showing all owners who have a bike,but not owners who have all bikes</p>
