<p>Is it possible to rewrite the following left join:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT wanted.id AS wanted_id, offers.id AS offer_id, departure_city, departure_country, destination_city, destination_country, departure_date_min, departure_date_max, MIN(price) as price FROM wanted LEFT JOIN (SELECT id, wanted_id, SUM(price) AS price FROM `offers` GROUP BY offer_date) AS offers ON wanted.id = offers.wanted_id WHERE wanted.id IN (SELECT wanted_id FROM wanted_by_user WHERE user_ID=%d) group by offer_id </code></pre>  <p>as a subquery? I have tried it like this, and technically, it works fine, BUT: it only works like an inner join would (meaning not showing rows if there's no match in the table 'offers'):</p>  <pre><code>FROM wanted, (SELECT id, SUM(price) AS price FROM `offers` GROUP BY offer_date) AS offers "     ."WHERE wanted.id IN(SELECT wanted_id FROM wanted_by_user WHERE user_ID=%s) </code></pre>
