<p>Hi I have the code below which brings through a total by due and complete as well as the date. However I want to summarize by date, please can someone assist?</p>  <pre><code>        SELECT  CONVERT(varchar(15), GRLastDt, 111) as Date_,                       (                     SELECT        COUNT(*) AS Expr1                     FROM            dbo.AN_Admin_VendorReturns_090_Final                     WHERE        (Complete = 'X') AND (CONVERT(varchar(15), GRLastDt, 111) &gt;= GETDATE() - 60)                 ) AS Complete,                 (                     SELECT        COUNT(*) AS Expr1                     FROM            dbo.AN_Admin_VendorReturns_090_Final AS AN_Admin_VendorReturns_090_Final_1                     WHERE        (Complete &lt;&gt; 'X') AND (CONVERT(varchar(15), GRLastDt, 111) &gt;= GETDATE() - 60)                 )  AS DUE                      FROM            dbo.AN_Admin_VendorReturns_090_Final         group by CONVERT(varchar(15), GRLastDt, 111) </code></pre>
