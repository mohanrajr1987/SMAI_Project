<p>We are developing a number of "current status" plugins for our system. These plugins monitor different elements on our servers. </p>  <p>One of the end goals that has been identified is that we should have a world map showing the locations of all our servers and the current status of the server(Green, Orange, Red circles) as indicated by these plugins.</p>  <p>Clicking on a colored circle should link the user to detail about this location.</p>  <p>Can anyone give some insight on what route i should take with displaying the map and status circles. Take into account this map should be zoomable as large cities will have a lot of servers.</p>  <p>The ability to easily add new locations to the map is important. Id like it to be by supplying the locations longitude and latitude. </p>  <p>The configuration utility that i would like this added to is written in C# WinForms. If its significantly easier/better id be happy creating a separate utility in WPF. We don't want to use any paid 3rd party services.</p>
