<p>Sorry, this one is hard to phrase in the title. So here's what I'm trying to do. A workshop has many districts. Each district has exactly one district_contact (actually a district_contact_id). How can I use ActiveRecord to model the relationship between workshop and district_contact? I want to be able to do this:</p>  <pre><code>Workshop.district_contacts </code></pre>  <p>And get a collection of the actual user objects. Right now, I've done it using a short function:</p>  <pre><code>  def district_contacts     district_ids = []     self.districts.each do |district|       if district.contact_id         district_ids &lt;&lt; district.contact_id       end     end     User.find(district_ids)   end </code></pre>
