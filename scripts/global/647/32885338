<p>I need to choose between two databases. In one approach, it will store relational data, but to work with it I want to use Bookshelf ORM. In other way, I can use MongoDB, and store data as an object with no need to use ORM to use data as an object.</p>  <p>So, which is preferred with CRUD approach? </p>  <p>The application is designed to be as fast as possible.</p>  <p>Data sample:</p>  <pre><code>{   "ownedBy": "(someProjectID)",   "keyword": "node",   "references": [     {       "type": "post",       "groupId": -1478414,       "messageId": 14578,       "text": "Node.js is great language!"     },     {       "type": "comment",       "groupId": -1478414,       "messageId": 744114,       "text": "Yeah, I agree. Node is very flexible"     }   ] } </code></pre>
