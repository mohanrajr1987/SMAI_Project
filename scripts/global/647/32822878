<p>I'm new to ORM, and I don't really understand the whole concept,</p>  <p>Now I have the following issue, suppose that I have 3 tables in mysql db,</p>  <p>owner: owner_id, owner_name book: book_id, book_name owner_has_book: owner_id (reference to owner.owner_id), book_id(reference to book.book_id)</p>  <p>Now, if I want to execute something like <code>'select * from owner, book, owner_has_book where owner.owner_id = owner_has_book.owner_id and book.book_id = owner_has_book.book_id and owner_id = 1'</code> How can I do this?</p>  <p>thx</p>  <p>Jasen</p>
