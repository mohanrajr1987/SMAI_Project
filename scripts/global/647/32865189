<p>I have 2 tables. Customer and Account and there structure is like this.</p>  <pre><code>---------------              -------------- Customer Table               Account Table ---------------              -------------- Cust_Id                      Acc_Id Cust_Name                    Cust_Id Address                      Acc_Number Phone                        Balance </code></pre>  <p>And I have 2 classes in my project.</p>  <pre><code>class Customer {     public int Cust_Id { get; set; }     public string Cust_Name { get; set; }     public string Address { get; set; }     public string Phone { get; set; }  }  class Account {     public int Acc_Id { get; set; }     public int Cust_Id { get; set; }     public string Acc_Number { get; set; }     public decimal Balance { get; set; }  } </code></pre>  <p>Now I have 2 store procedures, one to get all customers and one to get all accounts. I want to retrieve records in this form.</p>  <pre><code>Cust_Id, Cust_Name, Acc_Number, Balance </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to ask how to joins these 2 tables. Should i make a new <code>store procedure</code> which will return this result set or should i do <code>mapping in C#</code> code. If i make new sore procedure then i need to create a new class which will store result set in the form which i want. But it will increase one more class in the project. If i first read all customers and then all accounts, how to create a relation between these data. or Is there any other way to handle this kind of situation.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
