<p>I have the following situation:</p>  <pre><code>Users        Tasks ------       ------ user_id      task_id â€¦            title tasks done </code></pre>  <p>Of course the is a 1:n relation (Users --&lt; Tasks). The tasks can be done several times (multiple dates). The most efficient way for me is to also create an n:m relation (Users >--&lt; Tasks) with an intersect table</p>  <pre><code>Users_Tasks ----------- user_id task_id date </code></pre>  <p>The model class User there will have an array "tasks" as well as an array "dones" where all done tasks with dates are stored and lasy loaded.</p>  <p>Okay, easy enough to achieve that. Though: Would you do it that way?</p>  <p>But how about ORM? I'm using ReadBeansPHP4 right now to accomplish that task. How can I archive that intersection pattern above in RedBeans?</p>
