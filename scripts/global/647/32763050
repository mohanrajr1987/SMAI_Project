<p>We're building an iOS application that uses SQLCipher. A coworker has started writing a rudimentary ORM on top of FMDB. </p>  <p>Given that SQLCipher is written on top of SQLite, I figure there <em>must</em> be some way to take an existing ORM (such as DBAccess) and run it against SQLCipher.  But I googled around and couldn't find a way. I'm not sure if this is because of my unfamiliarity with the iOS ecosystem, or because there really isn't.</p>  <p>So, the question: Is there an ORM you can use with SQLCipher iOS? What is it and how do you set it up?</p>
