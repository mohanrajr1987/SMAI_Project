<p>The problem concerns two SQLite database tables: <code>persons</code> and <code>measurements</code>.</p>  <p>One person can have many measurements, but each measurement has only one person. So it is a 1:M relationship between person and measurement.</p>  <p>I already have a list which shows all persons. The database entities from the <code>persons</code> table are converted to person objects by my self-written object relational mapping class, then the person names are shown in the list.</p>  <p>Now I have to expand the list to show not only the person names but also the number of measurements for each person.</p>  <p>One list entry should look like this:</p>  <pre><code>Person XY 2 Measurements </code></pre>  <p>One approach would be to make a separate <code>COUNT</code> query for each person just before the list is shown. However, this would be a really inefficient and bad solution.</p>  <p>Another approach would be to add a <code>ref_count</code> column to the persons table, which has to contain the number of related measurements.</p>  <p>If feels like a relational database has a bad structure for problems like this. How should I implement the list?</p>
