<p>I heard that from someone . Hibernate and ibatis can't generate correctly with complex query . </p>  <p>From my point of view . It's ok with hibernate because it has to convert from hql to native sql . But with ibatis , we can write native sql , so ibatis can generate correctly with complex query ? I'm right or wrong in this case ? </p>  <p>Can you help me to clarify this situation ?</p>
