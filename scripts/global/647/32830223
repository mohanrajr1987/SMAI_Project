<p>I'm saving logintokens with a lifetime of 365 days using the following sequelize beforeCreate Hook:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>let hooks = {     setExpires: (instance, options, done) =&gt; {         if(instance.get('expires')) {             return done();         }         instance.set('expires', Sequelize.literal('NOW() + INTERVAL 1 YEAR'));         return done();     } };  Logintoken.beforeCreate(hooks.setExpires); Logintoken.beforeBulkCreate(hooks.setExpires);</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>It works great as long as I use MySQL. Other dialects such as SQLite don't understand <code>NOW() + INTERVAL 1 YEAR</code>, which is bad. Is there a built-in cross-dialect way to achieve what I am trying to do here? </p>  <p>I've already studied the docs, googled like hell and even had a look at the source code but couldn't find anything that looks like date calculation.</p>
