<p>We have an Oracle DB that powers everything in the back end and are transitioning from PHP to Node.JS. Problem is, we need an ORM that's natively compatible with Oracle. The only "decent" one that I have found till now is <a href="https://github.com/lebretr/sequelize-oracle" rel="nofollow"><strong><code>sequelize-oracle</code></strong></a>. It's not fully completed yet and many important functions are missing.</p>  <p>I wanted to ask if there is any ORM library that supports Oracle directly. If not, is there a similar model-oriented library that supports Oracle?</p>
