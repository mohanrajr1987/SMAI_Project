<p>I'm sure this is a feature, but I would appreciate any pointers/help on the issue.</p>  <p>I'm using Spring (Boot) / JPA (Hibernate) stack. </p>  <p>If I query for an entity (called Homes) using JPA, and increment a Calendar field </p>  <pre><code>homeInstance.getListedDate().add(Calendar.DATE, 1), for example </code></pre>  <p>with no intention of saving this change back to the database (it's only for quick intermediary calculations as the several routines run on a list of these entities).</p>  <p>Then I call a nativequery using an injected EntityManager bean.</p>  <pre><code>@Autowired EntityManager em; ... Query nvqry = em.createNativeQuery(...) nvqry.getResultList() </code></pre>  <p>Doing this automatically persists the changes made to the entity above (which were never supposed to be persisted.</p>  <p>Is there a way to disable this feature without losing the in-memory changes? I manually persist anything I want using the repository, and as such a whole session persistence is useless for me.</p>
