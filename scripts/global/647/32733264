<p>I am trying to create a data model in Django, and would like some help from those familiar with Django ORM to advice the right approach to create the data models. </p>  <p>The idea: I want to store a list of hashtags that are associated in social media posts. 1 post can have multiple hashtags.</p>  <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is below the right data representation of the model above?</p>  <pre><code>Hashtag table: ==============  - hashtag_id (primary key)  - hashtag_name  Post table: ============  - Post_id (primary key)  - Post_name  Hashtag-post link table: =========================  - hashtag_id (link to id in hashtag table, need to specify primary key?)  - Post_id (link to id in post table) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> How do I create the ORM model with proper primary/foreign keys?</p>  <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do I make this query: Query all the posts associated in a hashtag in Django ORM?</p>
