<p>I know this could be an issue with security and privacy, but let's assume for now that the user has provided a service with the necessary permissions. The thing my service needs to know is this:</p>  <p>Whenever an onResume() of an activity is called, my service should know which activity was that</p>  <p>Is there any broadcast receiver that I could register? Or does anyone know of any other way?</p>  <p>The idea is as Android has a battery usage application that can break down how much percentage of battery was consumed by an application, I want to capture how much time is a user interfacing with an application, for which I guess I would need to keep track of its onResume calls.</p>
