<p>I started yesterday to ask questions and you guys were allways able to help, thats amazing.  Well I hope you can help me with this issue again.  This is the case: I have a rooted android smartphone and I'd like to send a MMS with a batch file, using adb commands, from a Windows PC. My approach until now is like this:</p>  <pre><code>adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.SEND -d "123; 213123; 123344532" -t image/jpg --es sms_body file:///sdcard/Pictures/JPG.jpg </code></pre>  <p>But it wont load the picture it just fill the textblock with the path wich is not what I want. I know there should be a way to manage this easily. The depths of the internet somehow doesn't provide much information with shell am start. I  hope you guys can give me some hints, solutions or a good link for my problem. Thank you a lot in advance.</p>
