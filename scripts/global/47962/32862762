<p>In my App I would like to take a picture. The current Fragment is within a TabHost. </p>  <p>Within a fragment I start the camera action with: </p>  <pre><code>Intent takePicture = new Intent( MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); getActivity().startActivityForResult( takePicture, 1); </code></pre>  <p>In my MainActivity I have the onActivityResult: </p>  <pre><code>@Override public void onActivityResult( int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent imageReturnedIntent) {        super.onActivityResult( requestCode, resultCode, imageReturnedIntent);        if( imageReturnedIntent == null) {             // immediately coming here when my OWN app is singleTop or singleTask </code></pre>  <p>When my App contains an Activity with launchmode singleTask or singleTop, then onActivityResult <em>immediately</em> returns with imageReturnedIntent is null. When I remove the launchmode in my App, then it works again. </p>  <p>How can I fix this? </p>  <p>What I read on the internet is that the activity that is launched (so, in my case the Camera App) should not have a launchmode singleTop or singleTask. </p>  <p>Question: how can my own Activity (having launchmode singleTop or singleTask) get an onActivityResult from a Camera App? </p>  <p>Notice: in Android 5.0+ this works fine. In Android 4.x not.</p>
