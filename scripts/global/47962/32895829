<p>i have created json object by following method. right now i am passing this to another activity by converting it into String by toString method and putting it in an Intent with some tag like "finalJsonData", which works absolutely fine. is this the ok way? if not then help me, if yes.. or in either condition please explain when to use Parcels, aren't they required when an object can be easily converted into String? like this json object.. and then how can Gson help me out here in better way? </p>  <pre><code>private void createJsonObjects() throws JSONException {         JSONObject locDataObj = new JSONObject();         locDataObj.put("latt", mCurrentLocation.getLatitude());         locDataObj.put("longg", mCurrentLocation.getLongitude());          locDataArr.put(locDataObj);      }//in the end of repetitive execution of this method, locDataArr is being wrapped into Json object(main object).   </code></pre>
