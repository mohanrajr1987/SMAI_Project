<p>I am using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord.html" rel="nofollow">AudioRecord</a> class in my project to record audio from microphone. </p>  <pre><code>AudioRecord recorder = new AudioRecord(AudioSource.MIC,                                        6000,                                        AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_MONO,                                        AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT,                                        N*10); recorder.startRecording(); ... </code></pre>  <p>Generally, my recorder records audio signal periodically in background thread. </p>  <p>When I run my app, it grabs the microphone &amp; do the recording successfully. However, other apps (e.g. Skype) on the phone which also uses microphone can't be functional anymore, since my app is accessing the microphone.</p>  <p>My question is, is there a way that my app could be notified if there is another app also tries to access microphone, then my app could release the microphone access to other app to use? Is there such listener or broadcast in Android?</p>
