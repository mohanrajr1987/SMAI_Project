<p>I tried picking a file from the internal or external storage with the code below:</p>  <pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT); intent.setType("file/*"); startActivityForResult(intent, 1); </code></pre>  <p>Of course it has <code>onActivityResult</code> method, and it's not the problem. It works fine in the modern phones or phones that have file manager installed. But the old one with no file manager throws </p>  <blockquote>   <p>android.content.ActivityNotFoundException: No Activity found to handle Intent { act=android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT typ=file/* }</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried switching to <code>ACTION_PICK</code> but no luck. I also tried <code>intent.setType("*/*");</code>, it didn't crash but the popup ask for action (videos, contacts,...) which is not true. I just want to pick any file not just a specified type.</p>  <p>I don't want to use any other file manager just to pick a file. Is there anyway I can get through this?</p>  <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
