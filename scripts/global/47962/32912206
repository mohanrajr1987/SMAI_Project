<p>I was wondering if anyone knew of an info source (other than android developer) which succinctly explained the code implementation for navigation drawers, if it had a flow chart showing it along with intents etc., that would be awesome, but any good sources would be appreciated!</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>  <p>Edit - I am looking through a navigation template from <a href="http://androidshenanigans.blogspot.pt" rel="nofollow">http://androidshenanigans.blogspot.pt</a>   (nice template) and am trying to understand how its setup, hence, a flow chart would be nice to find.  Thanks again!</p>
