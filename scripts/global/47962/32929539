<p>Been trying this for a while now. I am trying to pass JsonArray from one intent to another. Here is my code.</p>  <pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(this, DownloadService.class); Bundle bundle = new Bundle(); JSonArrayParser jSonArrayParser = new JSonArrayParser(dealTypeList); bundle.putParcelable("jsonArray", jSonArrayParser);  intent.putExtra("deals_list", bundle); this.startService(intent); </code></pre>  <p>JSonArrayParser implements Parcelable.</p>  <p>I have checked that the JSonArrayParser is being populated with the Jsonarray as expected before passing it to the Bundle.</p>  <p>The issue is when I read it out on the other intent. I get a null back for the JsonArray.</p>  <p>Here is what I have so far.</p>  <pre><code>if(intent.hasExtra("jsonArray"))         {             JSonArrayParser jSonArrayParser = null;             Bundle bundle = intent.getParcelableExtra("jsonArray");             if (bundle != null) {                 jSonArrayParser = bundle.getParcelable("deals_list");                 String jsonMyObject = bundle.getString("deals_list");                  jSonArrayParser = intent.getParcelableExtra("deals_list");                 if(jSonArrayParser != null)                 {                     JSONArray jsonArray = jSonArrayParser.getJsonArray();                     String ssad = "";                 }             }         } </code></pre>  <p>I have tried a lot of different variation to try and read the value out but it seems the JSONArray is always null. </p>  <p>Have searched through the internet before posting this. Please if someone can help that would be great.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I have tried passing JSonArray as string as following but that didnt seem to start the intent at all.</p>  <pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(your_activity.this, new_activity.class); intent.putExtra("jsonArray", dealTypeList.toString()); startActivity(intent); </code></pre>
