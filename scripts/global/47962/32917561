<p>I'm developing an app which I'd like to be launched when a specific action is made. In this case, it's when the built in barcode scanner scans something. When the scanner does scan something, I get the usual dialogue asking which app I'd like to use. The options are Google Chrome or Browser at the moment. I've looked for some kind of documentation on Google Chrome to try to find out which intents it listens for, but to no avail.</p>  <p>I was wondering whether there's an easier way to find out which intent-filters to use?</p>
