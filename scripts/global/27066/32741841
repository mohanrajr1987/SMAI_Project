<p>I'm trying to improve my skills in PHP by creating my own CMS infrastructure, probably based on a lightweight framework like FuelPHP.<br> Because I think it's better to have a goal, I would like to use this opportunity to build a multi site CMS.  </p>  <p>It would be a CMS for a game.<br> Basically, here the workflow:</p>  <p>Somebody create an account on the main site (<a href="http://www.mainsite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mainsite.com</a>), then create a site for his server (<a href="http://my-beautiful-server.mainsite.com" rel="nofollow">http://my-beautiful-server.mainsite.com</a>). People from his server would then come to the subdomain and register to interact with the forum, the gallery, updating their account, etc.</p>  <p>Is using subdomains a correct approach ?<br> If I use a wildcard for my DNS, how must the vhost be configured to redirect on the correct folder based on the subdomain ? Can I not use a folder system for each site and use only one app to handle everything by just "passing" the subdomain as a variable to the app to tell it on which site I am ? Is it reliable ?</p>  <p>If in the future I want to propose custom domain names, is it possible with this approach ? I would only need to handle domain name registering myself and add a vhost configuration to redirect on the correct folder ?</p>  <p>I'm a little lost on the correct and most robust approach.</p>  <p>Today I have the domain name and I will take a little VPS for testing.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot for any help to guide me in the good direction and sorry for my broken english, I had trouble finding ressources on the Internet.</p>
