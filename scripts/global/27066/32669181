<p>Can someone please help with the blocklayered module. I have tried everything found on the net, but still cant figure out the issue. I am using a customed theme and have hooked the module on top of categories. It is appearing, but not eveything is present and neither is the filter working.</p>  <p>The version im using is v2.0.7</p>  <p>here are the css i used:</p>  <pre><code>#center_column .layered_filter{   float:left;   width: 50%; } #center_column .layered_filter:nth-child(2n) {   clear:left; }   #layered_block_left div.filtr_type_weight, #layered_block_left div.filtr_type_price {     float: left;     width: 50%; } #layered_block_left div.filtr_type_manufacturer li {     float: left;     height: 18px;     width: 25%; } </code></pre>  <p>Also as you can see on the screenshot, no colors anything are appearing. I dont understand why.</p>  <p>I have followed the tutorial to hook the module on top: </p>  <p><a href="http://nemops.com/prestashop-layered-navigation-block-center-column/#.Vfq0D9LtlBe" rel="nofollow">click here</a> </p>  <p>As seen on the screenshot, it's looking good.</p>  <p>But i dont understand why it's not displaying properly, colors, style and all are not appearing and also its not filtering when the checkbox is checked.</p>  <p>Your help will be much appreciated</p>  <p>Please see link for screenshot.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.prestashop.com/forums/uploads/monthly_09_2015/post-1093790-0-67394200-1442576659.png" rel="nofollow">screenshot of the issue</a></p>
