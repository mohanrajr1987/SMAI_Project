<p>I would like to aggregate posts from different already existing blogs on my website. I want to show blog title and number of comments. The blogs already exists and I don't own them.</p>  <p>Do the most common CMSs provide RSS feed for comments by default so I can show number of comment next to each blog post?</p>
