<p>I am working with microweber CMS and it's written in PHP. Being a n00b, I do not really understand the code flow at some places. This is one example. A link i click leads to:</p>  <p><a href="http://xx.xx.xx.xxx:5599/cms/trial?editmode=y" rel="nofollow">http://xx.xx.xx.xxx:5599/cms/trial?editmode=y</a></p>  <p>Here, <a href="http://xx.xx.xx.xxx:5599/cms/" rel="nofollow">http://xx.xx.xx.xxx:5599/cms/</a> is the root www directory of the application </p>  <p>trial?editmode=y is dynamically added</p>  <p>This link then redirects to another location.</p>  <p>I am not able to find where this redirection is mapped in the folder /cms.</p>  <p>Please help!</p>
