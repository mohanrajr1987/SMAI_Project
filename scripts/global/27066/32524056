<p>Im programmatically adding renderings to an Items Placeholder. The code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>var newRendering = new Sitecore.Layouts.RenderingDefinition(); newRendering.ItemID = "{SUBLAYOUTID}"; newRendering.Placeholder = "PLACEHOLDER"; newRendering.Datasource = "{DATASOURCEID}";  //Adds the new RenderingDefinition to the device renderings. device.AddRendering(newRendering); </code></pre>  <p>This works. I'm also trying to add a condition, but have no clue how. Does anyone has an idea?</p>
