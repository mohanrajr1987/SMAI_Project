<p>I'm currently attempting to install <a href="http://anchorcms.com/" rel="nofollow">Anchor CMS</a> on my Apache server.</p>  <p>I have successfully deployed it to the server. That is, when I go to www.domain.com, I am greeted with the default-themed front page and a test post :)</p>  <p>However, if I try to click the post, or go to the admin area, I get an error such as:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Not Found: The requested URL /posts/hello-world was not found on this server.</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, if I follow the (in this case) post link using a direct link, such as:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>www.domain.com/index.php/posts/hello-world</p> </blockquote>  <p>It works completely fine. So, it appears to be a problem with the rewriting.</p>  <p>I found another problem on Stackoverflow exactly like mine, located <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27731710/how-to-rewrite-directive-on-apache-for-anchor-cms">here</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately, I did the same steps and nothing works. Just to recap, this is how my VirtualHost looks:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     ServerName www.domain.com     ServerAlias domain.com     DocumentRoot /var/www/domain.com/public_html      &lt;Directory /var/www/domain.com/public_html&gt;         AllowOverride All         Require all granted     &lt;/Dictory&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And this is how my Anchor CMS config.app file looks:</p>  <pre><code>return array(     'url' =&gt; '/',     'index' =&gt; '',      ...(rest of the data here)... </code></pre>  <p>As the <a href="http://anchorcms.com/docs/getting-started/configuration" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> states to use an empty index in this default case.</p>  <p>My .htaccess currently looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Options -indexes  &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;         RewriteEngine On         RewriteBase /          # Allow any files or directories that exist to be displayed directly         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d          # Rewrite all other URLs to index.php/URL         RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L] &lt;/IfModule&gt;  &lt;IfModule !mod_rewrite.c&gt;         ErrorDocument 404 index.php &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And it is located in the document root "public_html"</p>  <p>Sadly, even with these things configured, I still get the "Not Found" errors. I don't really know where to go from here :(</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <pre><code>Options -indexes  &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;         RewriteEngine On          RewriteRule ^ http://google.com [R,L]          RewriteBase /          # Allow any files or directories that exist to be displayed directly         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d          # Rewrite all other URLs to index.php/URL         RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L] &lt;/IfModule&gt;  &lt;IfModule !mod_rewrite.c&gt;         ErrorDocument 404 index.php &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I tried to put in a general rewrite to the .htaccess file, and it seems like it's not being executed:</p>
