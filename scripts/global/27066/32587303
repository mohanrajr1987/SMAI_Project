<p>We are using umbraco 7.1.3</p>  <p>As per client's requirement we need to create more then 550 Umbraco CMS sites for different cities with same template and asp.net user control which access data from one master database.</p>  <p>So we created one windows application that will create 550+ sites as per city name under one Non-Umbraco root site. We also managed to create different Umbraco database for each site is created and moved published code under to Non-Umbraco root site and convert to application and also updated Web.config file for each site dynamically.</p>  <p>After that when-ever we found that our logic or UI was not correct we also update DLL, ASCX user controls and CSS to all sites through same window application.</p>  <p>Till now everything was going smooth, but now we have one major change and that contains new document type, template, macro and new menu needs to be added dynamically. Updating published code through windows application was easy but we don't found any way to make update Umbraco database of 500+ sites through another application.</p>  <p>Some websites are already updated through respective sites owners, so without affected any existing changes we need to add new macro, content, document type and menu for each site and we don't know in which Umbraco database we need to enter records?</p>  <p>Had already posted the same in umbraco issue tracker <a href="http://issues.umbraco.org/issue/U4-7105" rel="nofollow">#U4-7105</a> Also in Umbraco forums <a href="https://our.umbraco.org/forum/umbraco-7/using-umbraco-7//71443-update-multiple-umbraco-sites-through-windows-application#comment-71443" rel="nofollow">#71443</a></p>  <p>Thanks &amp; Regard</p>
