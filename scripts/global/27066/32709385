<p>I have taken an existing site. Integrated a CMS (Comfortable Mexican Sofa). Then installed Redactor. Threw Redactor I have the ability to add content and display it on localhost:3000. I also have the ability to upload Files. I run into a problem using its insert image function in the content box. </p>  <p>My server log:</p>  <pre><code>    Started POST "/admin/sites/2/pages/2/null?ajax=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-09-22 01:26:44 -0400  ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [POST] "/admin/sites/2/pages/2/null"):   actionpack (4.0.3) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/debug_exceptions.rb:21:in `call'   actionpack (4.0.3) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/show_exceptions.rb:30:in `call'   railties (4.0.3) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:38:in `call_app'   railties (4.0.3) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:20:in `block in call'   activesupport (4.0.3) lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:67:in `block in tagged'   activesupport (4.0.3) lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:25:in `tagged'   activesupport (4.0.3) lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:67:in `tagged'   railties (4.0.3) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:20:in `call'   actionpack (4.0.3) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/request_id.rb:21:in `call'   rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/methodoverride.rb:21:in `call'   rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/runtime.rb:17:in `call'   activesupport (4.0.3) lib/active_support/cache/strategy/local_cache.rb:83:in `call'   rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/lock.rb:17:in `call'   actionpack (4.0.3) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/static.rb:64:in `call'   rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/sendfile.rb:112:in `call'   railties (4.0.3) lib/rails/engine.rb:511:in `call'   railties (4.0.3) lib/rails/application.rb:97:in `call'   rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/lock.rb:17:in `call'   rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/content_length.rb:14:in `call'   rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb:60:in `service'   /Users/bam/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p353/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:138:in `service'   /Users/bam/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p353/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:94:in `run'   /Users/bam/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p353/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/server.rb:295:in `block in start_thread' </code></pre>  <p>My Gemfile's relevent Gems (I did not add imagemagick to the Gemfile although I have installed it).</p>  <pre><code>ruby '2.0.0' gem 'rails', '4.0.3'  gem "paperclip", "~&gt; 4.3.0" gem 'comfortable_mexican_sofa', '~&gt; 1.12.0' gem 'kaminari' </code></pre>  <p>config/environments/development</p>  <pre><code>  # Per https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip   Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/usr/bin/" </code></pre>  <p>routes</p>  <pre><code>  comfy_route :cms_admin, :path =&gt; '/admin'   # Make sure this routeset is defined last   comfy_route :cms, :path =&gt; '/', :sitemap =&gt; false </code></pre>  <p>config/initializers/paperclip.rb</p>  <pre><code>Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/usr/bin/" </code></pre>  <p>When I file upload and it is successful this is the first two lines of the server log where the difference occurs is on line 2.</p>  <pre><code>Started POST "/admin/sites/2/files?ajax=true" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-09-22 01:48:10 -0400 Processing by Comfy::Admin::Cms::FilesController#create as HTML </code></pre>  <p>Feel Free to checkout out the repo I was not sure how do demonstrate the files that Redactor added. <a href="https://github.com/jpbamberg1993/aqqaluk" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jpbamberg1993/aqqaluk</a> the branch it "redactor".</p>  <p>Do not hesitate to critique this post it is my first one.</p>  <p>Thank You </p>
