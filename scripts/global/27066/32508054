<p>We have a customer portal which needs a blog and some other standard but simple functionality.  The primary use of the portal is in LOB functionality.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <ul> <li>Home with News (News is Maintained in CMS by company)</li> <li>Company Calendar (Maintained in CMS by company)</li> <li>Billing Inquiry (Written in ASP.Net MVC 4)</li> <li>Other LOB specific MVC functionality</li> </ul>  <p>We are currently keeping two distinct systems that share styling and both use WS-Fed to emulate a single application, but it makes maintenance difficult.  </p>  <p><strong>Can MVC be used as a reverse proxy for a portion of a page?</strong>  One page master template, and the partial page content is rendered by the CMS and inserted by MVC into the template?</p>
