<p>I want to create small website/content management system to search word/excel files and search contents of the file. Also would it be possible to search VBA codes. Can it be done using wordpress or any other CMS available or using any other technology. What I want to do is upload all the files (word and excel) in a local database. All these files have vba that I want to search against using keywords. The main puirpose is we sometimes create those templates and some of similar templates might have been done in the past so it would save time if we can search by entering keywords and not going through each and evrey template one by one</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
