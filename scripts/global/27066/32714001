<p>I saw there are some user permission type for me to select but I am thinking if I can have my own custom permission setting.</p>  <p>I am trying to build a cms system having several users from different areas. Each of them cant delete data input by other users and each of the will input data with a field indicating it is a data from whom.</p>  <p>Do I have to code it myself or Django-cms actually provides this option. </p>  <p>If references could be provided, it would be the best. Thank you</p>
