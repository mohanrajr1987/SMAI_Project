<p>Hey my company is looking at a production content management workflow software. We are looking at JIRA and ServiceNow and Adobe CQ. I understand that these are very different tools. However what we are looking at is any tool with a DAM and a workflow to authorize, approve and track content changes.Please help with suggestions or comparisons of the same.</p>
