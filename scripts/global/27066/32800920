<pre><code>from django.db import models from mezzanine.pages.models import Page  # The members of Page will be inherited by the Author model, such # as title, slug, etc. For authors we can use the title field to # store the author's name. For our model definition, we just add # any extra fields that aren't part of the Page model, in this # case, date of birth.  class Author(Page):     dob = models.DateField("Date of birth")  class Book(models.Model):     author = models.ForeignKey("Author")     cover = models.ImageField(upload_to="authors") </code></pre>  <p>So does Book also inherits properties of Page?  So it means any property or method of Page is accessible from the above code?</p>
