<p>I am looking for a solid CMS that can be used locally on my Desktop. It could be something like Docfetcher (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docfetcher/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/docfetcher/</a>), only with some additional CMS features like: Custom Meta Data Preview Functionality Tags</p>  <p>It should not be run on top of an application server, like embedded Jetty etc - chances are you would just run into trouble accessing the app due to Firewall constraints, Proxies, Anti-Virus software and what not. Plus there does not need an ongoing process for serving requests, the only thing that should be ongoing is file indexing like it is the case for DocFetcher.</p>  <p>Is there something? I would imagine it could be written in Java like DocFetcher and hence work on any OS.</p>  <p>Thanks! z4c</p>
