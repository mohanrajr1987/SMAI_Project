<p>My University runs its CMS which can be accessed only in University i.e using university's computer but whenever I try to access that CMS at home I comeup with forbidden or sometimes not found error. The url to cms is : online.pucit.edu.pk I think it's kind of intranet in my university. Please tell me about the possible ways to access CMS portal from outside the university.</p>
