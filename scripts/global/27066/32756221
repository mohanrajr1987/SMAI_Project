<p>I don't know how to properly format this question. Looking on S.O. I saw remotely similar problems that did not get a real response.</p>  <p>Here is what I am trying to do. I have a project that requires one page (home page if you will) for every census district in the continental United States. It requires these at the state, county and local levels.</p>  <p>I have a MySql list of these geographies that I believe would be more effective to use than clunky lists inserted into html. Perhaps adding a code to each entry for identification?</p>  <p>The Problem: Yes I can template the html and css with simple PHP. That only requires less than 1/2 dozen designs. But, If I use an MVC...do I really have to hand code 10's of thousands of routes to generate the urls? Or would a cms be more appropriate?</p>  <p>To make this problem EVEN better. Each page will have links to data RELEVANT to each location. One example of some of these would be collecting data from my adjacent jurisdictions list and posting on the appropriate page with links.</p>  <p>I KNOW they say do NOT put code in your MySQL database but considering the second problem wouldn't it be logical to actually include the urls IN THE DATABASE?????</p>  <p>I know this can be done programmatically, I just can not visualize the construct at all of how this is even remotely achievable.</p>  <p>There is NO chatter on google about this. I've spent an obscene amount of time looking. But I fear, ultimately, it has more to do with the fact that I don't know how to phrase the question to get an honest response. I would call it "dynamic" but everytime someone uses that term they get 100 responses to "look up" the definition of dynamic. So.. that much I HAVE learned, not to call anything in any form for any reason at any time "dynamic". You will just be flamed and ridiculed. I don't even use the nomenclature. No point.</p>  <p>BOTTOMLINE: I feel like I can see the engine, but I can't visualize the camshaft driving it. Is this foolish?</p>  <p>Of note: Some of the online resources I had hoped on giving proper guidance and solution to this unique problem are cursed with affliction of age. The info is just too old to apply to a living language that has "moved on". I'll waste too much attention focusing/debugging depreciated code examples rather than focusing on "clean" examples introducing new (or new to me) methods.</p>  <p>I think the scope of the project is what is throwing me. I am spinning thinking I need a tank when a garden trowel will probably do. Hmmm...</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any in-site. Apologies for the length of the post. But I wanted to be crystal clear on my objective since I am lacking the proper terminology to classify the problem.</p>  <p>Can I automagically create large volumes of url's based on a known geographic list. Can I automagically populate the templates that live in those url's with links to more pages and create urls for them. (The text for these links will be the same general topics but obviously the urls will be relevant to the page/geography to which they reside.</p>
