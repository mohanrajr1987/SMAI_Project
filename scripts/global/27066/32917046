<p>Shortly, i needed to help a good friend, to move her complete typo3 install to another provider.</p>  <p>There was no chance in getting help from the developer at all.</p>  <ul> <li>I exported and imported the tables</li> <li>downloaded all of the folder and uploaded it again</li> <li>I set new InstallTool Password and added new Administrator</li> <li>I updated the MySQL-Connection</li> </ul>  <p>Now everything seems to work correctly, BESIDES an error calling at the top of the page (where the language selection is supposed to be) saying:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR: Content Element type "sr_language_menu_pi1" has no rendering definition!</p> </blockquote>  <p>For now, I tried to hide this annoying layer with CSS-property display none ;)</p>  <p>But it's a website where I need to have multiple languages enabled.</p>  <p>I have no experience with typo3, so please describe possible solutions as simple as possible.</p>
