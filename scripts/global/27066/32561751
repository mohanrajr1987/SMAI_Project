<p>So web page is <a href="http://www.pauza.hr/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pauza.hr/</a> its food ordering page that connects many restaurants and allow customer to order online without contacting directly restaurant.  So the question is would you build this kind of web on wordpress or some other cms? And which plugins would you use or would you create your own code for this job? Keep in mind that you have to connect orders from your site with restaurants in real time...</p>  <p>Thx a lot :)</p>
