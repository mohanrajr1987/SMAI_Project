<p>I've been using a CMS I found online for almost a year (Secretary) with no problem until very recently, when checking up on it gave me an error. I logged into my CMS and I had  alerts that said " files cannot be uploaded because the folder is not writable." </p>  <p>I haven't touched anything (code, folders, etc) in the past year, so I don't really know where to start troubleshooting. I checked folder permissions and all folders were at 0755 and files were at 0644. Also tried using chmod, but that did not work at all. Also tried contacting Hostgator's live chat, but they were incredibly unhelpful because my package does not include tech support.</p>  <p>Any ideas on what has happened? Thank you!</p>
