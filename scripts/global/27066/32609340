<p>I've tried many CMS flavors like Prestashop, Drupal, Joomla and Wordpress for the admin Panel but they can't seem to manage my new website.I would like to find a Custom Management System to manage users and groups as follow (i'm talking about an administration panel to modify, select, add and delete users):</p>  <ul> <li>Users are categorized by the state they live in</li> <li>Every user has a tree of other users</li> <li>The users can be assigned to a group</li> </ul>  <p>The administration panel contains a statistic of users by age or sex or the group they belong to.</p>
