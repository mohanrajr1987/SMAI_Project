<p>I am testing a "page error handler" for 500 response using acs commons. I get a response written as 500 in (firefox --> webdeveloper) when I break the page. I do get the 500.html displayed. However, when I revert back the cause of the error and do a refresh, I still see the 500.html page displayed.</p>  <p>The cache.ttl and ttl has been set to 300 so I am trying after 5 mins only.</p>  <p>Am I missing something ?</p>
