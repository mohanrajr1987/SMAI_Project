<p>How do I add variable custom fields in a page in Silverstripe?  For example if I created a custom field for "Hobbies", it is possible a person will have a several hobbies. And so I need the user to dynamically add another field to enter a hobby in the front end CMS. So maybe a button like "Add another hobby" the user can click in the CMS?  </p>  <p>Another question is how do I populate a table in Silverstripe programmitically? </p>
