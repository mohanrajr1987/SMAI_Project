<p>I'm a web designer and mainly built HTML &amp; CSS websites, I know Wordpress as well but I don't think the site I want to build would work with</p>  <p>The site I would like to build is similar to this <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.glassdoor.com/</a> I want people to review a product and write there opinions, Could anyone point me in the right direction? I know I will have to learn some new skills but really want to start building more advanced website.</p>
