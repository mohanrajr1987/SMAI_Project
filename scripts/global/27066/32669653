<p>I tried implementing TidyCMS for a simple one-pager that uses the <a href="http://layerstheme.com/portfolio/html/night-club/" rel="nofollow">http://layerstheme.com/portfolio/html/night-club/</a> theme. I installed it correctly but when I click on "Make editable" in the sidemenu the site will just be stuck at the loading screen (letting me edit that area only) and not move on after loading. I commented the lines with the loader and now I can edit certain areas but I can't edit areas that appear for example when a user have to click somewhere to toggle its content.</p>  <p>Is it the bad tool for the job or am I missing something?</p>  <p>Also, a simple lightweight CMS that is similar would be helpful if you can recommend it, it must be free.</p>
