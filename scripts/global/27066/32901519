<p>I'm new to Composite C1 and building a new webiste. In the Console,I've added a new website. In the Content perspective,the tree looks like this:</p>  <p>Websites                                                                                                     </p>  <pre><code>     Website1(this is the default website)       Website2(new website created by me) </code></pre>  <p>How can I access 'Website2' in Visual Studio? How can I "publish" this new website to a Test server? I have given a hostname to the new website. When I create a new entry in the DNS,I need to give a machine name and I dont want to give my computer's name since it's a sandbox. I want to publish the new website to a Test server.</p>
