<p>I currently have a custom module that defines a set of three pages inside the custom module.</p>  <p>I'm looking to make an area of one of the custom pages editable by the admin. After some research, it seems that the way to go about this is to create custom block from the admin area, however i'm not sure how would i display the content inside the module custom page. I have also read on how to add a custom block inside the custom module, but could not how to make the content editable in the admin area.</p>  <p>Any thoughts on how to make a region editable inside a custom page in a a custom module?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
