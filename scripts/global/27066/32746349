<p>I would like to develop a web application based on Mezzanine CMS, so I went through these sites. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-get-started-with-django-based-mezzanine-cms-on-" rel="nofollow">Get Started With Django-Based Mezzanine</a> <br/> <a href="http://bitofpixels.com/blog/mezzatheming-creating-mezzanine-themes-part-1-basehtml/" rel="nofollow">mezzatheming</a><br/> <a href="https://rodmtech.net/docs/mezzanine/a-mezzanine-tutorial-take-2/" rel="nofollow">A-mezzanine-tutorial-take-2</a><br/> <a href="http://www.rosslaird.com/blog/building-a-project-with-mezzanine/" rel="nofollow">Building a Project with Mezzanine</a></p>  <p>They have not covered most of the parts of Mezzanine. I couldn't find any good resources except document about Mezzanine CMS.</p>  <p>can any one suggest other tutorial or book for this CMS?</p>
