<p>I have custom objects called publications. i want to display them in a list view. I am new to nodejs. Someone please help me with which files to edit, how to fetch custom objects and how to display them in a specific template? I googled a lot but didn't find any clear explanation anywhere. And the pencilBlue video regarding custom objects show how to create a custom object and not how to display the custom objects.</p>
