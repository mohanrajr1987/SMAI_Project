<p>I'm currently working on a project to create a database of reputable businesses in my town, our Facebook page has become a go-to community resource so now we want to do the same with a site!</p>  <p>Part of this is creating a directory, and while I can hard code everything in HTML I feel this is unnecessarily long winded, and will require a lot of maintenance.  What do you think is the best way to do this? Is there a form of CMS I can embed that allows me to easily add and remove entries to this directory without having to hardcode everything?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance, Ollie</p>  <p>EDIT: Another thing is that members of the team who aren't proficient in HTML and CSS would like to be able to make edits to the directory content, so if it has a GUI that would be ideal :)</p>  <p>EDIT: Dumping my question as "primarily opinion based" is grossly unhelpful when it's well thought out opinions I'm looking for.  I don't think this question is likely to incite some sort of Apple vs Samsung debate.  If this is the wrong place to be asking such questions please advise. :)</p>
