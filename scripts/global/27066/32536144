<p>We are building a news website similar to a blogging platform or a CMS. Users can write articles, post comment, like and share. We are newbies and are unable to decide between Jackrabbit Oak and MongoDB?</p>  <p>I went through the following thread <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3908584/when-to-use-jcr-content-repository-over-other-options">When to use JCR (content repository) over other options?</a>. I understood that JCR allows to organize your content in a structure that closely matches your needs. I think this can be accomplished in MongoDB also. The answer compares JCR to RDBMS rather than NoSQL DBs like Mongo.</p>  <p>Also JCR Oak seems a bit complex so I would prefer to keep the stack simple and invest time on MongoDB - Unless Jackrabbit offers features which are extremely important and not present in MongoDB.</p>  <p>Can somebody explain is there any killer feature in JCR Oak over MongoDB?</p>
