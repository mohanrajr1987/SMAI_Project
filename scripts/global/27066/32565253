<p>My current Wordpress site is with Amazon Web Services. I am attempting to add a new plugin to the development but keep receiving the message;</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>To perform the requested action, WordPress needs to access your web server. Please enter your FTP credentials to proceed. If you do not   remember your credentials, you should contact your web host.</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>I have read that I may need to change permissions for this to work, can anyone help with the process of this? Or alternatively, would it be easier to set up an FTP user?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
