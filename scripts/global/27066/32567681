<p>I want to make a q&amp;a website like ask.fm, where you can have your own page and get anonymous (or not anonymous) guestions. Not like Yahoo or Stackoverflow. But I can't find any information on what to start with, so I'm asking you guys. What do I have to learn to make a website like this? What CMS to use, etc. Any information that could help me to build the website myself. Thanks.</p>
