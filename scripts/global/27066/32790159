<p>A client I'm working with has a large CMS installed (Kentico) that they use for various sites. For their intranet they want to downsize to a simpler web system.</p>  <p>The site involves authentication (Active Directory), groups, and potentially some server-side code.</p>  <p>The client's on-staff web designer, who's in charge, <strong><em>really</em></strong> wants to be able to use DreamWeaver to manage/design the intranet. This is <em>almost</em> non-negotiable, and could be considered a requirement.</p>  <p>I'm not really sure what DreamWeaver allows. Being ignorant to DreamWeaver, I always saw it as a web-designer platform for static websites, or in use with php.</p>  <p>How feasible is it to use DreamWeaver to manage an intranet site that requires authentication, groups, etc., along with server-side code? Also, are there any CMS's that easily integrate DreamWeaver? Anything in .NET?</p>
