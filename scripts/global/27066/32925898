<p>On my page www.trendee.dk the default language is danish, which is fine, but if you change the language to English, and then go to a new page, it goes back to Danish... How can i make it stay on English?</p>  <p>Also, i've set up different currencies, but when i've clicked on a product and select a different currency, nothing happens, the currency stays the same.</p>  <p>What to do?</p>
