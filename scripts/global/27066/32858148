<p>I'm not sure why, but suddenly my joomla is having errors. Mostly on content and menus.</p>  <p>I can't really describe by the code what is happening, because I also don't understand why.</p>  <p>I'll use my article section to explain and as a comparison.</p>  <p>This is a common 'Edit Article' section in any common joomla.</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/4/4c/Help-3x-content-article-manager-add-new-article.png/670px-Help-3x-content-article-manager-add-new-article.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/4/4c/Help-3x-content-article-manager-add-new-article.png/670px-Help-3x-content-article-manager-add-new-article.png" alt="Joomla Content"></a></p>  <p>And this is what I have in My Joomla</p>  <p><a href="http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn19/GODHEAPER_dionpasc1809/Joomla-error_zpst9yaajnr.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn19/GODHEAPER_dionpasc1809/Joomla-error_zpst9yaajnr.jpg" alt="My Joomla"></a></p>  <p>There is a lot difference between the two, I will summarize :</p>  <ul> <li>There is no 'Alias' field to set the url_aliasing</li> <li>There is no 'Content, Publising, Images and Links, etc...' to set publishing options, etc.</li> <li>The 'Category' Field is in the top, and the 'tags' field is not changeable</li> </ul>  <p>My question is : <strong>What is causing this? Is it extension, article module, or what?</strong></p>  <p>Please elaborate and provide solution.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
