<p>I'm trying to write a basic command-line program in C++. While the rest of the code probably has problems galore, too, the one I'm facing now is this: I've split the inputted line into pieces, but I can't figure out how to get all but the first so I can pass it down the line as the list of arguments for the command.</p>  <p>If this was Ruby, I'd do something like this, where <code>parts</code> is the array of space-separated arguments for the command:</p>  <pre><code>command = parts[0] args = parts[1..-1] </code></pre>  <p>where <code>parts</code> is the array of bits that were space-separated. </p>  <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>:  How can I get all but the first elements of a <code>vector</code>?</p>  <p>If using another type makes it easier, feel free to say as much -- I don't think I'll have <em>that</em> much trouble porting it over.</p>  <p>I've tried using a <code>deque</code>, but I don't want to modify <code>parts</code>, just get pieces of it. I've also searched around on this site, but all of the questions that turn up are either related but solved in a way that I can't use, starts of a really hacky workaround that I'd rather avoid, or totally unrelated.</p>  <hr>  <p><sup>P.S. I'm not <code>using namespace std</code>, but <code>std::</code> is a pain to type so I omitted it here. Please do provide it in your answers, where applicable.</sup></p>  <p><sup>P.P.S. I'm just (re)starting at C++ so please provide an explanation along with your answer.</sup></p>
