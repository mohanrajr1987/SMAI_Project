<p>I'd like to extract numeric information from  a character vector in R. Every line in the vector has the same structure, and it as follows: </p>  <pre><code>  [1] "Capturing tweets..."                                                                       [2] "Connection to Twitter stream was closed after 1 seconds with up to 1 tweets downloaded."   [3] "Capturing tweets..."                                                                       [4] "Connection to Twitter stream was closed after 1 seconds with up to 1 tweets downloaded."   [5] "Capturing tweets..."                                                                       [6] "Connection to Twitter stream was closed after 1 seconds with up to 1 tweets downloaded."   [7] "Capturing tweets..."                                                                       [8] "Connection to Twitter stream was closed after 1 seconds with up to 1 tweets downloaded."   [9] "Capturing tweets..."  </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, there are two kinds of recurring numeric information in this vector. One that outlines the duration of the open connection, i.e. number followed by "seconds", and another indicating the number of tweets downloaded. I require only the number of tweets, so I'd like to generate a new, numeric vector that contains only the number which is followed by "tweets" for every line. </p>
