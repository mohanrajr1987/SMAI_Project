<p>I have two files with two columns which represent two vectors respectively. I need to multiply the second components of both vectors when the first components are equal. If a is the x component:</p>  <pre><code>output = [] for a in vector2[:,0}:     if a in vector1[:,0]:         output.append(vector1[:,1]*vector2[:,1) </code></pre>  <p>I am pretty new with python and I guess this is not the best approach, any help will be appreciated. Many thanks</p>
