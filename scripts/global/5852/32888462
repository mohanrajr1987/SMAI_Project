<p>I have a vector that hold int32_t and I am working on windows 64 bit. I need to convert it to an int array.</p>  <p>since on my specific platform int32_t and int are essentially the same type, i can do this: (assuming that array has enough space to hold all data from vector)</p>  <pre><code> int out[1000]; //assuming that in has less data than 1000   std::vector&lt;int32_t&gt; in=getdata();  memcpy(out,&amp;int[0],in.size()); </code></pre>  <p>But it works on platform that uint32_t and int are essentially the same type. </p>  <p>What is the best way to do this to make sure that it is platform independent and will work on any platform that for example int is not 32 bit?</p>
