<p>I have a <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code> with contiguous shuffled values from 0 to N and want to swap, as efficiently as possible, each value with its position in the vector.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>v[6] = 3; </code></pre>  <p>becomes</p>  <pre><code>v[3] = 6; </code></pre>  <p>This is a simple problem, but I do not know how to handle it in order to make it trivial and, above all, very fast. Thank you very much for your suggestions.</p>
