<p>There is function that I can not edit it which has the following declaration:</p>  <pre><code>void foo(std::vector&lt;uchar&gt;&amp; vector_to_filled_with_data); </code></pre>  <p>I want to call this function but I want it to fill a pointer instead:</p>  <pre><code>void method_that_would_called_from_another_place(){      uchar* to_be_filled =/*new uchar[n]*/;      foo(to_be_filled); } </code></pre>  <p>P.S. commented part is optional.. I can erase it or leave it. I know it is totally bad behavior. However, it is for native-manged wrapper so I have to deal with raw pointers.</p>  <p>EDIT: I want the data to live out of the scope so getting 'vec.data' is not an option. I want it to be thread-safe</p>
