<p>I'm new at Java, I'm trying to make a 3-dimensional vector with the numbers 10-28 in it. </p>  <p>I also want to print the average of all the numbers, this is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code>    int[][][] v = {{{10, 12, 14}, {16, 18, 20}, {22, 24, 26}},                    {{11, 13, 15}, {17, 19, 21}, {23, 25, 28}}};       for (int[][] n : v) {         for (int[] b : n) {             for (int c : b) {                 System.out.print(c + " ");             }         }         System.out.println();      }     {          int x = 0;          for(int i=0; i &lt; v.length; i++)         x = 18 + v[i];         double average = x / v.length;         } } </code></pre>  <p>Though I get an error when I'm doing the loop part of it.</p>
