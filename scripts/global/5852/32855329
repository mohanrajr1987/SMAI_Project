<p>I have a poker hand and I need to check for three of a kind.  Is there a way to see if 3 elements in the vector are the same but the other 2 are different?</p>  <p>E.g.:</p>  <pre><code>hand &lt;- c("Q","Q","6","5","Q") </code></pre>  <p>Should return <code>TRUE</code> for three of a kind.</p>  <pre><code>hand2 &lt;- c("Q","Q","6","6","Q") </code></pre>  <p>...would be a full-house though, and shouldn't be identified as a three of a kind.</p>
