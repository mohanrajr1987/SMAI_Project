<p>I am accessing some C++ objects using PyROOT. In PyROOT, something like a C++ vector can be looped over in the same way that a Python list can be looped over.</p>  <p>One of these objects is represented by the following printout:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;class '__main__.vector&lt;char,allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;'&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Since it is a vector, I can loop over it successfully and I can get its length (which is correct), however, I don't know how to deal with its <em>elements</em>. When I print one of the elements of the vector, I get a representation like the following:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SDLbw.png" alt=""></p>  <p>How could I try to access this type of object? I expect it to be effectively a Boolean or something with a 0 or 1 value.</p>
