<p>Today I up to date android studio to 1.4 version. I saw in the changelog that you can compile an app with vector image also for api &lt; 21. I tried it. I changed the gradle version from 1.3.0 to 1.4.1 and implemented vector image instead of raster. During building process I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>Error:Execution failed for task ':app:transformClassesWithDexForDebug'. &gt; com.android.build.transform.api.TransformException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51\bin\java.exe'' finished with non-zero exit value 2 </code></pre>  <p>Sorry for my bad english. I hope you understand. Thanks in advance.</p>
