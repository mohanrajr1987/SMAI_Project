<p>I have a vector that is filled dynamically and will always contain a repeating sequence with characters and length that I am unsure of. For example, the vector could contain these elements:</p>  <pre><code>0 1 1 2 3 1 0 1 1 2 3 1 0 1 1 2  </code></pre>  <p>and the repeating sequence in that vector is:</p>  <pre><code>0 1 1 2 3 1 </code></pre>  <p>How can I search the vector and find those elements. I would like to put the found sequence in a new vector. I assumed at first it would only take a simple for loop and checking for repetition of the first and second element in the array, so in the case above I would exit the loop when I reached <code>0 1</code> a second time, but the problem is that it cannot be assumed that the first 2 elements will be in the repeating pattern, so</p>  <pre><code>0 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 </code></pre>  <p>can be valid elements in the vector. Any ideas?</p>
