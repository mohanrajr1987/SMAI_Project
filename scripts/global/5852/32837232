<p>Suppose I have the following sorted vectors as input: </p>  <pre><code>[22] [22, 23] [22, 46] [22, 46, 47] [22,23,33,44,45,46,55,56] </code></pre>  <p>I want the following output which shows the count of consecutive numbers in each vector:</p>  <pre><code>1 //edgecase: if there's 1 number it's consecutive) 2 //22, 23 are 2 consecutive numbers 0 //22, 46 not consecutive 2 //46, 47 are 2 consecutive numbers 7 //22,23 (2) 44,45,46 (3) 55,56(2) 7 consecutive numbers </code></pre>  <p>My vector will not have duplicates. </p>  <p>What I have so far is:</p>  <pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; numbers; int consecCount=0; if (numbers.size()==1)         consecCount++; else{     for (size_t k=1; k&lt;numbers.size(); k++) {         if (numbers[k]==numbers[k-1]+1) {             consecCount +=2;         } } </code></pre>  <p>Of course this method doesn't work for the last array. The solution seems really wrong. </p>  <p>My actual vectors are really large, so prefer any ideas that does not involve using a another vector</p>
