<p>The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.11.0.0/docs/Data-Vector-Generic-Mutable.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a> says that <code>new</code> "creates a mutable vector of the given length" and <code>unsafeNew</code> "creates a mutable vector of the given length. The length is not checked." </p>  <p>However <a href="https://github.com/haskell/vector/issues/30" rel="nofollow">this resolved github issue</a> indicates that <code>unsafeNew</code> does not zero the memory while <code>new</code> does.</p>  <p>Which one is it?</p>
