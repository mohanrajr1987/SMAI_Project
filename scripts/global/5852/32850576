<p>Looking at some code my professor gave me and I don't understand what is happening. I am new to programming and completely lost. </p>  <pre><code>vector &lt;_Account*&gt;*myvector = nullptr; </code></pre>  <p>So I know he made a vector, and I know of an existing class called <code>Account</code> so is this a <code>vector</code> of pointers to an <code>Account</code> objects? and I don't know what the second asterisk does? </p>
