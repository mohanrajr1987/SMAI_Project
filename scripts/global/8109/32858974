<p>I have created a bucket in Amazon S3 and have uploaded 2 files in it and made them public. I have the links through which I can access them from anywhere on the Internet. I now want to put some restriction on who can download the files. Can someone please help me with that. I did try the documentation, but got confused. </p>  <p>I want that at the time of download using the public link it should ask for some credentials or something to authenticate the user at that time. Is this possible?</p>
