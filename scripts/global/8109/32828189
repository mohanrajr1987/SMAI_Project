<p>I'm facing a problem with an app. I have sent a version (2.35.0.2-debug) to a coworker email to do some tests.    Then I have uploaded the final version (2.36) to Google Play Store.</p>  <p>The problem is that my coworker uninstalled the debug version to install Google Play version, but his phone only installs the debug version (2.35.0.2-debug).</p>  <ul> <li>I did not uploaded 2.35.0.2-debug to Google Play (neither to alpha or beta versions).</li> <li>When I click "Install" and "Accept", the progressbar is shown and hidden fastly. I think there's some kind of cache in his phone.</li> <li>I have already cleaned data, cache, removed updates from Google Play Store, Google Play Services and some other Google apps.</li> <li>When I open app details, it's possible to see the right version (2.36).</li> <li><p>App is "installed" even I turn off wifi and mobile network.</p>  <p>Could you help us, please?</p></li> </ul>  <p>Thank you, Luis Ribeiro</p>
