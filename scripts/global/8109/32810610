<p>I'm building a servlet-based web service which provides RDF data as a file download. My idea was to pass the response object's OutputStream to the Jena model's write method.</p>  <pre><code>Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel(); ... response.setContentType("application/n-triples"); response.setHeader("Content-disposition","attachment; filename=out.nt"); ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();  model.write(out, "N-TRIPLES", null); out.flush(); out.close(); </code></pre>  <p>However, this way I only get an empty file.<br> Writing the model works fine using <code>model.write(System.out, "N-TRIPLES", null);</code>. <br> The download itself also works, as I can write strings to the file by doing <code>out.write(someString.getBytes("UTF-8"));</code> <br> What am I doing wrong?</p>
