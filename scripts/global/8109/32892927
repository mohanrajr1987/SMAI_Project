<p>I have a similar problem as in this thread <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25526322/how-do-i-initialize-all-scenes-at-the-start-in-sprite-kit">How do I initialize all scenes at the start in Sprite Kit?</a></p>  <p>and I want to take a deeper look at the Apple "Adventure Game" example. Unfortunately I can not find the source code anymore. It seems that apple has (re-) moved it.</p>  <p>Does anyone have a copy or the new link of the Apple "Adventure" source code ?!</p>
