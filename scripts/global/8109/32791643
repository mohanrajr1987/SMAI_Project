<p>I came across this product called <a href="http://gonightshift.com" rel="nofollow">NightShift</a> which downloads or pre-loads Netflix movies and shows at night, when you might not have bandwidth limits like with satellite or if your internet is slow.</p>  <p>I downloaded their software that is supposed to be loaded on to a usb stick to plug into the Router. In their download folder they have a source of curl and looking through their setup scripts, they are using curl to download Netflix videos.</p>  <p>How is this done with curl? By setting the user-agent as a download friendly device? Setting cookies like the browser? </p>  <p>The url for a video is pretty straight forward : netflix.com/watch/XXXXXXXX</p>  <p>XXXXXXXX being the id of the video.</p>  <p>Some caveats :</p>  <ul> <li>DRM is not broken, so the video cannot be played offline. When the video is played, ability exchange DRM keys is needed. I too am not interested in breaking DRM.</li> <li>They are not directly working with Netflix and this is not an official procedure where they have special access. </li> </ul>
