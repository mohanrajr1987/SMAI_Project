<p><strong>Please see how the download works before answering</strong></p>  <p>I want to show the user the % of the complete download and when its done I want to force a download dialog box.</p>  <p>My guess is a a part of the file is being sent to the client from the server and after all the parts are sent they are put together and a client side download is generated by using something like <code>window.location="application/octet-stream,"+allParts;</code></p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks :)</p>
