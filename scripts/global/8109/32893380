<p>I'm trying to download files in an Electron app using Dialog and fs, but I'm getting files that are corrupted and nearly twice the size they should be. </p>  <pre><code>dialog.showSaveDialog({ title: 'Downloader', defaultPath: '/' + fileName },                 function (filePath) {                     var fileStream = fs.createWriteStream(filePath);                     fileStream.on('open', function(fd) {                         $http.get(url + fileName)                             .success(function(data, status, headers, config){                                 fileStream.write(data);                                 fileStream.end();                             })                             .error(function(data, status, headers, config){                                 console.log('product download failed');                             });                     });                 }); </code></pre>  <p>I attempted downloading a basic .txt file with using this code and the file came through fine - the right size and uncorrupted. But anything larger gives me a bloated file size and a corrupted file. </p>
