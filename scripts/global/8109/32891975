<p>First post here so be nice to me. I am trying to download an excel file from a website. The website has a button which can be pressed to download the excel file. I looked in the code and was able to come up with a url that if entered into IE takes me directly to the download "open/save" dialog box. I then used that url in vba in excel that works to open up the download box where it is asking to open or save the file.</p>  <p>I would like to save the file to the same name everytime as I am going to have another workbook that looks at the data and returns results. </p>  <p>I know this question has been asked a million times because I have searched and searched but no code I have tried will work. </p>  <p>This is my code so far</p>  <pre><code>Sub TESTING() 'Need to reference to Microsoft Internet Controls Dim URL As String 'URL = Worksheets("References &amp; Resources").Range("URLMSL") URL = "http://cts/Tacs/OperationDrillExport/76" Dim IE As Object Set IE = CreateObject("internetexplorer.application")  IE.Visible = True  IE.Navigate URL Do While IE.ReadyState &lt;&gt; 4 DoEvents Loop  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>The website is an internal website so it will not work from the outside but I would think the code is the same either way. </p>
