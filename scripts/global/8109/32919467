<p>If one stores public files using Amazon's S3 storage would the send_file method be secure? The file parameters could then be passed by the user without the threat of having all of your application's files downloaded.Therefore, the public files and the application files are stored in separate places.This threat was discussed here as well: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6392003/how-to-download-a-file-from-rails-application">How to download a file from rails application</a>  </p>  <p>I think this would eliminate the security issue but I'm not sure. Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>
