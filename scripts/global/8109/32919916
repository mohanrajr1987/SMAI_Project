<p>I developed a XAML browser application (XBAP). I am having a problem getting the latest version of the XBAP to update on the client computer.  However, I do not want to ask customers to run any commands in the command line. What will I have to do to make the XBAP automatically update on the client computer? Instead of the updated XBAP refreshing on the client computer, the previous version of the XBAP continues to run.</p>  <p>and Also not Download Whole Application instead of Downloading Only Updates. </p>
