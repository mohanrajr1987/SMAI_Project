<p>I'm developping an online shop with PrestaShop 1.6.1 on an Apache server. I have no problem with Firefox, Chrome and Safari. But on Microsoft Edge (on my computer) and on my Windows Phone, the product pages does never show up. All other pages are ok, the issue is only when I try to open a product page with Edge or with my Windows Phone.</p>  <p>What is the issue? What can I do to solve it?</p>
