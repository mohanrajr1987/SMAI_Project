<p>I am trying to download the contents of folder which are all files to the my hard drive and this is the code I have been using. I have tried different variations of it but all of them print only the last item in the list for all </p>  <pre><code>for i in seed:     new_download=open(i,'w')     print (i)     new_download.close()     open_file=open(i,'wb')     for k in seed_id:         client.file(k).download_to(open_file)         print (k)     open_file.close() </code></pre>  <p>The files I want the name of the file in box to be matched in my machine.</p>
