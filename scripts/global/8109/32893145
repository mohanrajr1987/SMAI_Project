<p>My project requires to download a Gzip file from the Internet, that contains multiple subfolders in a tree structure and images on the last folders, and save all the structure with subfolders and images on Documents Directory.</p>  <pre><code>Root_Folder/    Folder_Level_1/       Folder_Level_2/          Image       Folder_Level_2/          Image    Folder_Level_1/       Folder_Level_2/          Image       Folder_Level_2/          Image </code></pre>  <p>Download and compression work fine, the problem is when I try to save the content on the documents directory, as it threats all the content if it was a single file.</p>  <pre><code>NSData *data = ...uncompressed file... NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *path = [[paths objectAtIndex:0] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"FileName"];  BOOL success = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] createFileAtPath:path                                                        contents:data                                                        attributes:nil]; </code></pre>  <p>I don't even know if it's possible to save the structure of subfolders I am trying to save... If it's possible, what's wrong on my code and what's the proper way to do it?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
