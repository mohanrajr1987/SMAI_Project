<p>As the title says, I am getting a NullPointerException at <code>list[i].setName(name);</code> and I can't figure out why. A Student contains a surname and a score. data.txt is in a format of first line: amount of entries second line: name (space) score, same for third, fourth etc. New at Java and on Stack Overflow, so please let me know what other details I should give. The method in question is below:</p>  <pre><code>        public static Student [] readListFromFile() {         Scanner s = new Scanner("data.txt");         File fileName;         boolean weGood = false;         while (weGood == false) {             System.out.println("Please enter the file name:");             fileName = new File(getInput()); //user can input their own filename                  try {                     s = new Scanner(fileName);                     weGood = true;                 } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                     System.out.println("File not found, please try again");                 }             }         int listlength = Integer.parseInt(s.nextLine());         Student [] list = new Student[listlength];         for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.length &amp;&amp; s.hasNext() == true; i++) {             String name = s.next();             Double score = Double.parseDouble(s.next());             list[i].setName(name);              list[i].setScore(score);         }         return list;     } </code></pre>
