<p>I have a Adapter in my application which inflates posts and shows them in a <code>ListView</code>. Each post has an image, so it uses <code>LruCache</code> to store images.</p>  <p>The app works well completely, but it crashed two or three times and I couldn't realize what was the problem. Only last time, I could get this log from LogCat:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>E/AndroidRuntime(2407): Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: key   == null || value == null</p> </blockquote>  <p>The crashes happen only when app is recently installed (When I delete the app from the device and install it again)! When I open the app for the first time and start scrolling up and down so fast, sometimes it crashes. (It won't happen all the time, it's completely random!)</p>  <p>And after that, it won't crash anymore... :/</p>  <p>I think it has something to do with LruCache and empty cache. I saw <strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24921696/support-lib-lrucache-throws-nullpointerexception-key-null-value-null-f">this question</a></strong>, but that wasn't my problem! I did check for null cache in my code:</p>  <pre><code>if (MainActivity.thumbnailsCache.get(postID) != null)         {             imageViewThumbnail.setImageBitmap(MainActivity.thumbnailsCache.get(postID));         } else {             new DownloadAndSetImageTask(thumbnailURL).execute();         } </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestion?</p>  <p>P.S.: I know my question doesn't have enough details, but that's all the information I have!</p>
