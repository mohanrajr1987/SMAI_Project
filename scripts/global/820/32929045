<p>My Add-on is not loading jQuery or any other script - and the console says:    <code>Blocked script execution in... because the document's frame is sandboxed and the 'allow-scripts' permission is not set.</code></p>  <p>There is no iFrame to speak of to set the permission in.</p>  <p>I haven't had this problem during the rest of my lengthy dev cycle. What is the problem here?</p>
