<p>Background: doing a tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS and Jquery. Also using Bootstrap's CSS library and jQuery's JavaScript library. Used the Bootstrap's grid system to create the empty tic-tac-toe game board.</p>  <p>Question on this step: Draw an X or an O when a user clicks one of the squares on the board.</p>  <p>The actual question: So far I only found this possible solution: jQuery animate() Method. Would this be one way to go? Any other suggestions? Thanks.</p>
