<p>I'm new with rails and gems and I learn how to internationalize my website. I know how to use I18n gem but I have one problem and I don't find a solution on the Internet, maybe I didn't see it...</p>  <p>In <code>config/locales</code> I have:</p>  <pre><code>devise.en.yml devise.fr.yml (I downloaded the translation in my language) en.yml fr.yml </code></pre>  <p>My <code>ApplicationController</code>: </p>  <pre><code>def set_user_language   I18n.locale = current_user.language if user_signed_in? end </code></pre>  <p>As you an see it, the translation has to be dynamic and not static. But I18n just search in <code>en.yml</code> or <code>fr.yml</code> and not in devise So everything is translated except devise strings...</p>  <p>I don't understand where is the problem... It can be cool if I could merge all files by lang.</p>
