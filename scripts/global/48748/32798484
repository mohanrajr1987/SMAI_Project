<p>What I want: Using Devise for user sign up, login etc... When a user signs up and is confirmed, I'd like to create a bunch of user default templates for that user. </p>  <p>What I've tried:  I've attempted to override Confirmations#show so that show.html.erb would be the view and #setup_user_defaults() is called upon successful confirmation.      class ConfirmationsController Devise::ConfirmationsController</p>  <pre><code>    def show       render('show')       setup_user_defaults()       super     end </code></pre>  <p>I keep getting an error that says I can only have 1 redirect or render in an action. The reason why having this view is important to me is because #setup_user_defaults() takes a little too long for comfort that a user might hit refresh or something screwing up the process</p>  <p>My thoughts: I am a newbie and haven't learnt about background jobs yet. So, my question is: Is this a background job? Or how can I get #show to have a view that says "Your account is being set up. This may take a few minutes." Without using AJAX (I'm not at that point yet).</p>  <p>Or any other ideas?</p>
