<p>I have a question on how to approach the design of an integration. I have two models <code>Company</code> and <code>User</code>. In my case, users will register for my app and then be presented with the option to connect the app to their different accounts (Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn) so that they can view/create posts/tweets/etc. Because <code>Company</code> <code>has_many</code> <code>Users</code> and the social media accounts belong to the company, I want to tie the credentials to the <code>Company</code> model using another model called <code>Provider</code> to store the credentials, therefore allowing any user that has permission to access the company's social media account.</p>  <p>I've been following various tutorials on how to configure multiple omniauth providers, but they all focus on tying them to the user model and tell me to add <code>devise :omniauthable</code> to my user model.</p>  <p>How do I make <code>Company</code> omniauthable instead of the user? Do I even need to make my model omniauthable if I'm not going to allow user authentication/registration view omniauth?</p>  <p>This is my first time building social media integrations, so I hope my question makes sense. Thanks!</p>
