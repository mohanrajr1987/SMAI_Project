<p>I have searched for an answer here and I am getting more and more frustrated!! I'm sure it will be simple for you but I cannot figure it out.</p>  <p>I am following a relatively simple 'Pin type' app tutorial but when I get to installing Devise it just doesn't work. Rather than keep trying to solve that I simply want to revert my project to a previous git add. and git commit, which I assume is stored locally within my /pin_board/.git folder??</p>  <p>Please can somebody help me to get my current project at /rubystack/projects/pin_board back to how it was when I did the git add . then the git commit -am "********".</p>  <p>Thank you so much!</p>  <p>Stuart</p>
