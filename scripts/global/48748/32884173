<p>I have a basic setup of rails and devise with confirmable modul. I have overwritten the <code>send_devise_notification</code> to use the <code>ActionMailer</code> which uses <code>ActiveJob</code> for the delivery.</p>  <p>In my envirement configs I have set <code>config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq</code> That all my ActiveJobs run on sidekiq.</p>  <pre><code>def send_devise_notification(notification, *args)   devise_mailer.send(notification, self, *args).deliver_later end </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately it seems that sidekiq is too fast and tries to send the mail before the database transaction is done and therefore runs into a <code>Account with id = ... not found</code>. he retries it obiously and succeeds at some point.</p>  <p>Anyone with the same problem or idea how to solve this? The <code>wait</code> option for <code>deliver_later</code> is a no go.</p>
