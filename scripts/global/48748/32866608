<p>So I have implemented devise for authentication I am facing a problem I need to change some of my user object right after its created and my I am also using confirmable module when I update my user object in after_create call back it automatically changes the confirmation_token and I get error invalid confirmation token first time. If I resend confirmation email it works my questions how can I prevent devise to change confirmation_token or send confirmation email automatically so that I can send updated/correct token.</p>
