<p>i'm using rspec/capybara in my rails project for tests, which is working fine with the default driver. But when i switch to webkit or selenium i get logged out after every request that i make. This code is working as expected, i see the logged in page 2 times:</p>  <pre><code>require 'rails_helper'  feature 'test' do   scenario 'this' do     user = FactoryGirl.create :user     login_as(user)     visit root_path     save_and_open_page     visit root_path     save_and_open_page   end end </code></pre>  <p>When i set webkit or selenium as driver only the first page is the logged in version, on the second page i'm logged out:</p>  <pre><code>require 'rails_helper'  feature 'test' do   scenario 'this', driver: :webkit do     user = FactoryGirl.create :user     login_as(user)     visit root_path     save_and_open_page     visit root_path     save_and_open_page   end end </code></pre>  <p>How can i fix this?</p>
