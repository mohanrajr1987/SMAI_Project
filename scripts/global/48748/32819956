<p>I am getting an OAuth2 error when I run the client Ruby on rails application using the sso-devise-omniauth-provider and sso-devise-omniauth-client gems. These are the links :-</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/joshsoftware/sso-devise-omniauth-provider" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/joshsoftware/sso-devise-omniauth-provider</a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/joshsoftware/sso-devise-omniauth-client" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/joshsoftware/sso-devise-omniauth-client</a></li> </ul>  <p>I followed the instructions as mentioned in these posts for configuration of both provider and client. Currently I have two client apps, and have configured them correctly.I have kept different APP_IDs and APP_SECRETs for both client apps. Also it is worth mentioning here that I have used the josh_id.rb file as it is without changes. I have 'required' this file in config/initializers/omniauth.rb i my client apps.  </p>
