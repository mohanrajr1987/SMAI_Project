<p>I have seen many questions about this topic, but nothing is helping. I added Bootstrap into my website and now my logout functionality isn't working. I raked my routes and got this the line</p>  <p><code>destroy_user_session DELETE /users/sign_out(.:format)      devise/sessions#destroy</code></p>  <p>so It's not getting confused as a GET. My logout code looks like <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= link_to('Log Out', destroy_user_session_path, :method =&gt; :delete) %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></p>
