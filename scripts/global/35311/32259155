<p>I have a classic VB6 ASP application compiled into dll's and executed through COM. The web site pulls from a SQLServer database. </p>  <p>One particular function builds a page by getting data rows, and then for each data row queries the database again to build rows in a sub table.</p>  <p>The problem is that if this page is large, and if the request for the page comes from a remote machine, then the IIS server gets stuck in the SendResponse state and never sends the page. If I call that same page using the same dataset, but call it from a browser running on the server itself, the page is quickly built and rendered. If I modify the sqlquery so that fewer rows are returned and the page is smaller, all clients can quickly load and render</p>  <p>I think I've confirmed that even when the page hangs the sql queries complete quickly and the COM objects have completed building the page. </p>  <p>I have a test server where I can test exact copies of the application but I haven't been able to find a setting in IIS or the apps web.config files that will duplicate the issue. </p>  <p>Is there something at the OS network layer I should be checking?</p>
