<p>By hosting the service in Local IIS it works fine via IIS but it displays protocol error "Only Http is registered" when launched via Visual studio. But the error is not on all the Pcs.</p>  <p>I mean when I run the same service on my computer it works fine on IIS as well as when launched via VS. No error.  But when I run it on different computer It displays protocol error via VS but works fine on IIS.</p>
