<p>Recently I have been creating Application Pool in IIS for Asp.Net Websites. What seems surprising to me is that those App Pools were having v4.0 , while the websites were targeting .Net framework v4.5 / v4.5.1 </p>  <p>Entry in Web.config of Individual websites:   <p>and this is what is App Pool Settings:   </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fwRho.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fwRho.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Isn't it like for targetFramework="4.5", App Pool version should be 4.5, for targetFRamework="4.5.1", App Pool version should be 4.5.1 ? </p>  <p>Does App Pool version 4.0 handles all Web Application/Websites developed in 4.5 and 4.5.1 as well ?</p>
