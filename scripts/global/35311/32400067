<p>Additionaly to the infamous slow-start problem, which occurrs in ASP.NET application running on IIS, we experience another one.</p>  <p>After a fresh application start (e.g. iisreset) the first request takes some time as usual. However in the current application every other request to a page that hasn't been loaded yet takes about 10-12 second on the first hit!</p>  <p>After the page has loaded, all other requests to the same resource are fast again (80-130 ms usually). This is also true to first loads of from other client machines, so this is not a client-caching problem.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>Machine | Request           | Duration | A       | GET /             | 43000 ms | (wakeup) A       | GET /             |    90 ms | B       | GET /             |    90 ms | A       | GET /registration | 12000 ms | A       | GET /registration |   110 ms | A       | GET /registration |   110 ms | A       | GET /registration |   110 ms | A       | GET /foobar       | 11000 ms | A       | GET /foobar       |    85 ms | B       | GET /baz          | 10000 ms | A       | GET /baz          |   100 ms | </code></pre>  <p>The interesting thing is that this doesn't happen when we run the application on our DEV machines (debug=true, etc). Only when we publish the website (debug=false, precompile, etc) this behaviour occurrs. </p>  <p>All static resources are bundled and cached properly and there is not one request that may take more than 1 second really. The application pool and the website are configured to start automatically and run forver.</p>  <p>I would greatly appreciate any hint. </p>
