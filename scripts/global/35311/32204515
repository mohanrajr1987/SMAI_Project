<p>I have an ASP.NET web site running under IIS 7.5  Works great.</p>  <p>Now we're experimenting with a new Windows 10 server, which runs IIS 10.  Copied the identical web site to the new server and try to open it:</p>  <pre><code>HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error  The requested page cannot be accessed because the related configuration data for the page is invalid. ... Error Code     0x8007000d ... Config Source:   -1:     0:  </code></pre>  <p>I <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/942055" rel="nofollow">looked up</a> the error code:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cause: This problem occurs because the ApplicationHost.config file or the Web.config file contains a malformed XML element.</p>      <p>Resolution: Delete the malformed XML element from the ApplicationHost.config file or from the Web.config file.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But that web.config file has been working for years.  Nothing has changed.  So I think that "malformed xml" message is a red herring, and there must be some other setting I'm missing.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
