<p>I have two sites hosted on the same server, but each bound to a different IP address.  Let's call them site1.com and site2.com:</p>  <pre><code>10.1.59.1   site1.com 10.1.59.2   site2.com </code></pre>  <p>They both work just fine, except when site2.com tries to POST an HTTP request to site1.com.  In that case, we get an error "the operation timed out" on this code:</p>  <pre><code>xmlSendHTTP.open "POST", "http://site1.com/xml.asp", False xmlSendHTTP.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text/xml" xmlSendHTTP.send xmlRequestDoc </code></pre>  <p>Upon investigation, even browsing to site1.com on the server does not work - you cannot visit the site in IE at all. The server does resolve the DNS and gets back the correct IP address (10.1.59.1).</p>  <p>We could change the code to something like:</p>  <pre><code>xmlSendHTTP.open "POST", "http://10.1.59.1/xml.asp", False </code></pre>  <p>but I would rather use the domain name in case the IP ever changes (doubtful, but possible) - I don't want to forget about something like that.</p>  <p>We have verified that this does work if done from another server. Using the same website on our failover server, it is able to successfully post to site1.com on the main server.</p>
