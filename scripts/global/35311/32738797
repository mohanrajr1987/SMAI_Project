<p>I'm using IIS 7.5 with PHP and I'm having troubles with my application, it is VERY slow and it can take more than 2 minutes to display the login screen.</p>  <p>I believe this is due to some kind of queue of requests to process.</p>  <p>I've taken a look at the "Worker Processes" menu in IIS and I found out there are tends request in the <em>DefaultAppPool</em> which seem to be waiting for a response.</p>  <p>Is this normal? How can I get rid of them?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m5R5y.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m5R5y.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
