<p>I have problem when checking the log of Event Viewer.  Windows Logs => Application</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to read performance data for the Server service. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the status code, the second four bytes contains the IOSB.Status and the next four bytes contains the IOSB.Information.</p> </blockquote>  <p>My application running on IIS 8 and .NET 4.5.1. I really don't know what is causing. Have any idea to fix this ? </p>
