<p>I am having a strange issue... I am getting this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error The requested page cannot be   accessed because the related configuration data for the page is   invalid.</p>      <p>Error Code: 0x80070003 (Cannot Read Configuration file)</p>      <p>Config File:   \?\E:\TFSLocal\Trunk\loggerTrunk\CommonLogViewer\web.config </p>      <p>Requested   URL:  <a href="http://localhost:80/CommonLogViewer/Search/GetAppModules" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:80/CommonLogViewer/Search/GetAppModules</a></p>      <p>Physical   Path: E:\TFSLocal\Trunk\loggerTrunk\CommonLogViewer\GetAppModules</p> </blockquote>  <p>It has to do with the path that the app is trying to find the web.config at. I have never had any files at the Physical path that is listed in the error, so I am not sure why it would be trying to look there. The correct path should be:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>E:\TFSLocal\MVC Logger\20150723\CommonLogViewer\Search\GetAppModules</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have done searches in the code for a match to that path and also in the IIS and have come up with nothing. Incidentally, the Physical path listed in the IIS is: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>E:\TFSLocal\MVC Logger\20150723\CommonLogViewer</p> </blockquote>  <p>Which is the correct path the code files. </p>  <p>Can someone give me a push in the right direction as to how to fix this error? </p>  <p>I have been looking at this for about a day now and haven't come up with a solution as to why it would be looking in a non-existent folder for the <code>web.config.</code></p>
