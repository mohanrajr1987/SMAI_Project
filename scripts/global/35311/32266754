<p>I have following http errors configuration:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;httpErrors errorMode="Custom" existingResponse="Auto" defaultResponseMode="File"&gt;         &lt;remove statusCode="500" subStatusCode="-1" /&gt;        &lt;error statusCode="500" prefixLanguageFilePath="" path="Error.html" responseMode="File" /&gt;     &lt;/httpErrors&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Also, errors are handled in Application_Error and <code>Response.TrySkipIisCustomErrors = true</code> is set in there. </p>  <p>It works fine in regular cases, but if exception occurs in http module initialization during application startup (module is third party, can't modify it's behavior), yellow screen of death is shown. Problem is, that in such case it does not reach Application_Error event and for some reason httpErrors settings are ignored.</p>  <p>Is there any way to suppress yellow screen of death in this case, I can't use <code>existingResponse="Replace"</code> as it overwrites response even if <code>Response.TrySkipIisCustomErrors = true</code> is used.</p>
