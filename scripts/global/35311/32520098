<p>I have recently purchased a dedicated server, I've set up the website in IIS and everything is working as expected, however when I click on register on this particular page it has a few drop downs which are database driven It errors and inside the event viewer I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Event code: 3005  Event message: An unhandled exception has occurred.  Event time: 11/09/2015 7:12:08 PM  Event time (UTC): 11/09/2015 9:12:08 AM  Event ID: daad4495c3164e4c9f5a220d3dd2d683  Event sequence: 5  Event occurrence: 1  Event detail code: 0  Exception information:  Exception type: Win32Exception  Exception message: The parameter is incorrect </code></pre>  <p>I can't find anything on the server that could potentially give me helpful information? because The Parameter is incorrect does not help me at all.</p>  <p>Can someone give me some guidelines into finding the relevant error message if possible?</p>
