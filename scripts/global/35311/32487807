<p>I have a SignalR hub which uses windows authentication in IIS to pass through the identity of the user connecting to the Hub (available in the Context.User.Identity.Name).</p>  <p>However when the client disconnects and the OnDisconnect event is raised in the hub, there is not an identity available in the Context. By this I mean there is an identity, it is marked as being authenticated, but the name of the identity is not available.</p>  <p>I was hoping in the OnDisconnect event the identity would be the identity of the app pool, but this does not seem to be the case.</p>  <p>The problem for me is that the code I call tries to use the identity to perform further authorisation.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to get or provide the identity when in the OnDisconnect event</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly received.</p>  <p>10/09/2015 Update</p>  <p>It seems this is happening if the client does not disconnect cleanly. If the client calls HubConnection.Stop(), the identity is available in the OnDisconnected event, however if the client stops without calling Stop(), there is no identity available. I will attempt to test whether dropping the network causes this issue also. This seems like a bug.</p>
