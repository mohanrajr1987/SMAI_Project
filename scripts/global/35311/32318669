<p>I have a Web Site Project, which actually runs in 32-bit enabled app pool, .net 2.0, IIS 7.5, Windows 7.</p>  <p>Here is the scenario that failing (but most important how it is failing). I pre-compile this site for x64 using aspnet_compiler.exe. I created new, 64bit-only app pool and I set a virtual directory where code is pre-compiled. I do this a lot, so everything as usual, only usually I test 32-bit version of code.</p>  <p>Once I try to access my website through url (<code>http://localhost/mysite/login.aspx</code>), my files in my virtual directory start to disappear. I open windows explorer and I can literally watch how files are being deleted. And then, they are gone and I get 404 response.</p>  <p>Has anyone seen anything like it?</p>
