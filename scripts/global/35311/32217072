<p>In my ASP MVC 5 application, I am able to upload files successfully to a virtual directory, but when I go to download the same file, I consistently get an access denied exception. The folder is located under:</p>  <p>'C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\</p>  <p>I have granted the account under which the application pool for the application runs read and write access to all the folders under Inetpub but I still get the same error. I have tried everything, restarted the PC and still no luck. I should also mention that this server is a VPS on godaddy. It's very weird that I can upload files to the folder, but when it goes to reading and downloading the file from the same application, I get access denied. Its windows server 2012 Any help is much appreciated.</p>  <p>Error:  Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request.
