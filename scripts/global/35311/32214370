<p>We recently added custom HTTP errors. We currently have a jQuery Mobile and ASP.NET application that are consuming these errors. They both use forms authentication. In the jQuery application users are able to authenticate without issues. When the users select a dropdown option several other dropdowns are populated using an AJAX call. The AJAX call is failing with a 401 Unauthorized. Looking into fiddler it looks like the ASPXAUTH cookie is being cleared right after logging in. This is only happening in Google Chrome and Android Browsers.</p>  <p>What is also very odd is if the 404 Custom Error is removed from the Web.Config the app works without issues. Any ideas?</p>  <p><strong>Fiddler</strong></p>  <p>This is the response which looks like it is actually sending back the login page after being logged in, but it never shows the login page again. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7hW5.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7hW5.png" alt="Fiddler Response"></a></p>  <p><strong>Web.Config Setting</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;httpErrors errorMode="Custom" existingResponse="Replace"&gt;           &lt;remove statusCode="404" subStatusCode="-1" /&gt;           &lt;remove statusCode="500" subStatusCode="-1" /&gt;           &lt;remove statusCode="403" subStatusCode="-1" /&gt;           &lt;error statusCode="404" path="/Error/NotFound.aspx" responseMode="ExecuteURL" /&gt;           &lt;error statusCode="403" prefixLanguageFilePath="" path="/Error/Forbidden.aspx" responseMode="ExecuteURL" /&gt;           &lt;error statusCode="500" prefixLanguageFilePath="" path="/Error/InternalServerError.aspx" responseMode="ExecuteURL" /&gt;     &lt;/httpErrors&gt; </code></pre>  <p>There is a child Web.Config for the mobile site that I tried removing the 404 to see if it would help but it did not. That being said 100% of the time if the 404 is removed from the parent Web.Config the site works as expected.</p>  <p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>
