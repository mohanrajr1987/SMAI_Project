<p>I want to run multiple instances of Php on my IIS 7.5 Server. I want to use the Php Manager module. Problem is, that I can only choose from one Php version. When i downloaded php5, there was a fast-cgi.php in the folder. But when I downloaded php4, there was none fast-cgi.php. So how can i use fast-cgi on php4 in order to run it on my server?</p>  <p>Does anyone has an idea, how to deal with that? Thanks in advance </p>  <p>Edit: I was able to insall php4. I used handler mapping to fastcgi. So now when i open: www.example.de/info.php4, it will show that it uses php4. But if i open up any uther site, like www.example.de/diffrent-site.php there will come the error: No input file specified. </p>  <p>How to deal with this? Any ideas?</p>
