<p>Everything works good till today i got error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Active Server Pages error 'ASP 0113'</p>      <p>Script timed out</p>      <p>/Index.asp</p>      <p>The maximum amount of time for a script to execute was exceeded. You can change this limit by specifying a new value for the property Server.ScriptTimeout or by changing the value in the IIS administration tools.</p> </blockquote>  <p>An increase in timeout value do not make any effect. In server timeout now is 360 sec but error appears after 20-30seconds</p>  <p>I tried to test sql query directly and saw that now query takes about 20 second, before it was about 2 second.</p>  <p>How to find why this is happens?</p>
