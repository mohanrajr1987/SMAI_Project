<p>I have a question about multiple instances of Php on IIS Server. Configuration: IIS 7.5, Windows Server 2008 R2. Right now there is PHP5 in Fast-CGI installed, and my website works. Problem is, there is an old website i want to run as well. Which is written in Php4 and the php files, have the extension php4. How can i install php4 as well, so if i open an php4 file, the server should use php4 to open them.</p>  <p>Thx in advance</p>
