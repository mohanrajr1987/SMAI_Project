<p>I am running IIS 7.5 on Windows 7 and I have Visual Studio 2012 and .Net Framework 4.5.1 installed. (Identity Foundation is integrated with .Net 4.5, so I think I don't have to install it seperately.) We are developing a web app with Claims based federated authentication where in we are writing session token to a cookie. I don't see any cookie getting added to the browser and I noticed that SessionAuthenticationModule is missing in IIS. Any suggestions?</p>
