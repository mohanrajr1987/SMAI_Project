<p>After hours of searching and investigating I came to conclusion that I should ask your advice.</p>  <p>I'm running .NET website application under IIS 7.5.  Application has Forms and Anonymous authentication enabled. (They can't be switched off for many reasons) Under one of the application sub-folders I have an .aspx file that should be accessed only via windows authenticated users (domain administrators, specific users group etc.) To solve this I need to somehow disable the access to this file unless user can provide windows credentials.</p>  <ol> <li>Windows authentication can't be used simultaneously with Forms authentication. And I'm unable to turn off forms authentication for that file/subfolder as it can be done only on application level.</li> <li>Disabling access for anonymous logon to that file via Authorization rules section gives me redirection to my form that is used for authorization. So this also isn't a solution.</li> <li>Removing IIS_IUSR within NTFS permissions gives me access denied error. </li> </ol>  <p>Question: Is there any way, how I could give access to that file only in case if a user provides windows credentials. </p>  <p>Note: No code changes or file movement is allowed for this. This should be done only by configuration. </p>
