<p>I am trying to set up my PC as a test/debug base for my Classic ASP sites. The OS is Win7 32 bit with IIS7.5.</p>  <p>The ASP pages work until I try to talk to the MySQL db which is located at my hosts server. The error I'm getting is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80004005'<br>   [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no   default driver specified</p> </blockquote>  <p>And the error seems to be at:</p>  <pre><code>Set objConn = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") strConn = "DRIVER={MySQL ODBC 5.1 Driver}; SERVER=1.2.3.4; DATABASE=******; UID=*******;PASSWORD=******; OPTION=3;" objConn.Open strConn </code></pre>  <p>I know the code is fine because it works at the host.</p>  <p>Wondering if this is a permissions issue?</p>
