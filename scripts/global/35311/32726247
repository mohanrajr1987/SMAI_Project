<p>I have ASP MVC 4 web application (intranet site) with Windows Authentication enabled. However when user tries to view the page, it keeps prompting for their Windows credential. The whole idea is once the user login in their machine successfully they would be able to view the website successfully without need for entering any credential. Also, even though when user enters their Windows credential, it keeps prompting for credential couple more times and ends up with 'HTTP Error 401.1 - Unauthorized' error message.  Here is what i have tried so far:</p>  <ul> <li>Added authentication and authorization tags in web.config</li> </ul>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;authentication mode="Windows" /&gt; 	&lt;authorization&gt;         &lt;deny users="?" /&gt; 		&lt;allow users = "*" /&gt;     &lt;/authorization&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <ul> <li>Disabled Anonymous Authentication &amp; Enabled Windows Authentication under 'Authentication' setting.</li> <li>Moved 'NTLM' to top on 'Windows Authentication' provider</li> <li>Changed 'Extended Protection' to 'Accept' on Advanced Settings of 'Windows Authentication'.</li> </ul>  <p>Does anyone know what am i missing which is not letting user view the page even though they are logged in their machine successfully? P.S: Tried in IE, Chrome.</p>  <p>Thanks. Sanjeev</p>
