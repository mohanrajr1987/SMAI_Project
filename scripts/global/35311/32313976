<p>I am having problem with Microsoft LightSwitch. I am using .Net framework 4.0. Few days back my application was working fine hosted under IIS. But now application started getting stuck on every save request(even a simple table screen, with only 5 total rows causing problem). I am not sure why this happened, might we have installed some updates. I faced same issue on 2 machines out of 10.</p>  <p>Even I tried remove my application and re-host in IIS. Even repair .Net framework but no success.</p>  <p>Each machine has its own local copy with SQL 2008 EXPRESS versions installed. And after a time period (may be 3-5 minutes) only a popup appeared with this error message:</p>  <p><strong>An unexpected error occurred while communicating with the server.  Please contact a network administrator.</strong></p>  <p>One more thing, if this could clarify, when the above mentioned error message appeared, in the background it also saves my changes in database. But if I put some custom code apart from simple saving, that custom code is not running. Means it only saves the current entity's content/changes and no other work is done. I also tried to just remove that custom code, but still getting the same STUCK problem + error message, with entity's changes saved successfully in the background.</p>  <p>I am just getting mad with this problem, I will highly appreciate if I could get some solution.</p>
