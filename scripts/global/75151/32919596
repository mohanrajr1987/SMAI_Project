<p>Good Day, I am a beginner in android development and laravel. I am creating a mobile-web application. I am using laravel in my Web app and I have this problem on generating the url that I should use when I retrieve json data for my android app. When I run it on localhost (<a href="http://localhost:8000/getAllLocations" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/getAllLocations</a>), I can view the json. but when I run it in using my ip address (192.168.x.xx/getAllLocations), it gives me an Object not found error. </p>  <p>Below are screenshots of my controller, route.php, the json result that I want to get, and the error I got after using the url: 192.168.x.xx/getAllLocations.</p>  <p>Please help me.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Y5cs.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Y5cs.jpg" alt="Here is my controller"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oxA4o.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oxA4o.jpg" alt="Here is my route.php"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/37RnS.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/37RnS.jpg" alt="Here is a screenshot of the result that I want to get with my android app. I got these after running localhost:8000/getAllLocations"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/35AtB.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/35AtB.jpg" alt="This is what I got when I try to retrieve the json data using my IP address instead of localhost in the url."></a></p>
