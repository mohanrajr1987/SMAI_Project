<p>I'm using windows 10 &amp; am having all kinds of trouble with Xampp/MySql/PhpMyAdmin, problems which I did not get on Windows 7.</p>  <p>So basically I made a Laravel website at work where I still use windows 7, so the password for the MySQL database works fine there.</p>  <p>However when I try to login on my website at home (windows 10) I get the 'using password NO' error... So to rectify this error I used the Xampp shell and executed this command: <code>mysqladmin --user=root password "newpassword"</code> which then allowed me to use any database dependent functions on my website that previously did not work, but now when I try to get onto localhost/phpmyadmin I am getting the error 'Cannot connect - invalid settings'.</p>  <p>So in summary it's either I can </p>  <p>A. get on phpmyadmin fine but none of the database dependent features of my Laravel site work. </p>  <p>B. The database features all work but I can't access phpmyadmin anymore. </p>  <p>Can anyone advise on how I can get both things to work?! </p>
