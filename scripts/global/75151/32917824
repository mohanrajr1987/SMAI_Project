<p>Currently I have the revisionable trait correctly storing and fetching the history of a model goes through change. </p>  <p>Each update to a model creates a record per field that was changed. </p>  <p>Is it possible to group those records by change?</p>  <p><strong>Example Time:</strong></p>  <p><strong>Round 1</strong></p>  <pre><code>$model = MyModel::find(1); $model-&gt;a = 5; $model-&gt;b = 6; $model-&gt;save(); </code></pre>  <p>This results in the following entries</p>  <pre><code>+----------+--------+-----+-----------+-----------+--------------+ | rev_type | rev_id | key | old_value | new_value |  created_at  | +----------+--------+-----+-----------+-----------+--------------+ | MyModel  |      1 | a   |         0 |         5 | [first date] | | MyModel  |      1 | b   |         0 |         6 | [first date] | +----------+--------+-----+-----------+-----------+--------------+ </code></pre>  <p><strong>Round 2</strong></p>  <pre><code>$model = MyModel::find(1); $model-&gt;a = 555; $model-&gt;b = 666; $model-&gt;save(); </code></pre>  <p>This results in the following entries</p>  <pre><code>+----------+--------+-----+-----------+-----------+---------------+ | rev_type | rev_id | key | old_value | new_value |  created_at   | +----------+--------+-----+-----------+-----------+---------------+ | MyModel  |      1 | a   |         0 |         5 | [first date]  | | MyModel  |      1 | b   |         0 |         6 | [first date]  | | MyModel  |      1 | a   |         5 |       555 | [second date] | | MyModel  |      1 | b   |         6 |       666 | [second date] | +----------+--------+-----+-----------+-----------+---------------+ </code></pre>  <p>In this case, I want to grab just records 3 and 4.</p>  <p>Initial thinking includes fetching and grouping by the <code>created_at</code> date, then simply fetching the last group (the most recent date). However I don't know if there is a guarantee that the dates will be identical.</p>  <p>Is there a way to group by update when retrieving the history from revisionable?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>Upon deeper investigation - revisionable created_at date is using the built in <code>-&gt;withTimestamps()</code> trait. For each insert in a batch insert (like the one revisionable uses), a fresh timestamp is grabbed as a Carbon date, this means (from my understanding) that a batch insert could have different created_at dates. </p>
