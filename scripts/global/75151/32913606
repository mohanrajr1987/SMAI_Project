<p>I can't for the life of me get Pjax to work with Laravel. I've tried everything but the blade templating is screwing it up. When I don't use the blade templating I can get it to work. </p>  <p>What happens is that the AJAX page loads and then unfortunately, there is a redirect to the same exact URL. So the page loads twice.</p>  <p>I have no idea how to modify the blade templating engine to accomodate Pjax and suppress this 2nd page load. Anyone have any clues?</p>
