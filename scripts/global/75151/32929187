<p>I have a $date and $time fields that are stored in my db, I would like to know how can I format these fields to display them in a different format?</p>  <p>e.g.</p>  <pre><code>2010-05-09 -&gt; 9th May 2010 </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>13:00:00 -&gt; 1:00PM </code></pre>  <p>I have tried to use carbon but it returns the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>InvalidArgumentException in Carbon.php line 414: Unexpected data   found. Data missing</p> </blockquote>
