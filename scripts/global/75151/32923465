<p>I'm attempting to store the email address of any user who uploads a file into an "uploader_name" string variable. I've attempted using the following code whichout success - attempting to upload the file will result in a <em>Class 'App\Http\Controllers\Auth' not found</em> error message being thrown back. I know this is a pretty basic question, but I can't seem to find any answers which specifically work with Laravel 5.</p>  <p>This is what I'm trying to use currently without success. </p>  <pre><code>$filelist-&gt;uploader_name = Auth::user()-&gt;email; </code></pre>  <p>If it helps, here's the full function which saves some of the automatic information of the file. </p>  <pre><code>public function store() {     $filelist = new Filelist($this-&gt;request-&gt;all());     //store file details - thanks to Jason Day on the unit forum for helping with some of this     $filelist-&gt;name = $this-&gt;request-&gt;file('asset')-&gt;getClientOriginalName();     $filelist-&gt;file_type = $this-&gt;request-&gt;file('asset')-&gt;getClientOriginalExtension();     $filelist-&gt;file_size = filesize($this-&gt;request-&gt;file('asset'));     $filelist-&gt;uploader_name = Auth::user()-&gt;email;     $filelist-&gt;save();     // Save uploaded file     if ($this-&gt;request-&gt;hasFile('asset') &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;request-&gt;file('asset')-&gt;isValid()) {         $destinationPath = public_path() . '/assets/';         $fileName = $filelist-&gt;id . '.' . $this-&gt;request-&gt;file('asset')-&gt;guessClientExtension();         $this-&gt;request-&gt;file('asset')-&gt;move($destinationPath, $fileName);      }        return redirect('filelists'); } </code></pre>
