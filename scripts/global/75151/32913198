<p>I got a table and the las column (actions) is supposed to have links to edit and delete a record. By watching some tutorials I saw an example where they use this links with Laravel Collective like this:</p>  <pre><code>    {!!link_to_route('view-folder.edit', $title = 'Edit',                  $parameters = $country-&gt;id, $attributes = ['class'=&gt;'btn btn-primary'])!!} </code></pre>  <p>But I'm getting the error </p>  <pre><code>ErrorException in UrlGenerator.php line 278: Route [countries.editCountry] not defined.  (View: /var/www/laravel/example/resources/views/countries/listCountries.blade.php) </code></pre>  <p>How sould I use this laravel collective links?</p>
