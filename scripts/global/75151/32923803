<p>Im creating an ansible role for deploying laravel5 project, now I do that with a "synchronize" (rsync)</p>  <p>I have my excludes file for the rsync, and the files structured like this:</p>  <p>the: "deploy-laravel5" role:</p>  <pre><code> files    excludes  tasks    main.yml </code></pre>  <p>now here is the tasks in main.yml:</p>  <pre><code>- name: deploy laravel projects   synchronize:     src: "{{item.src}}"     dest: "{{item.dest}}"     rsync_opts:       - "--exclude-from=excludes"   with_items: "{{projects}}" </code></pre>  <p>some playbook:</p>  <pre><code>---  - hosts: php   gather_facts: no    vars:   projects:     - {src: "../../twitter/", dest: "/web/boom/", envFile: "twitter.env"}     roles:     - deploy-laravel5 </code></pre>  <p>now when I run that, ansible says it can't find the "excludes" file</p>  <pre><code> msg: rsync: failed to open exclude file excludes: No such file or directory (2) </code></pre>  <p>I tried many different paths but nothing, any ideas how to point to the excludes file?</p>
