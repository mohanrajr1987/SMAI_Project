<p>I am writing a program in C#, which assigns data to a class, then assigns that class to the Tag Value of treeview nodes.</p>  <p>I am able to serialize my treeview to file using an answer I found here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5868931/3886453">Saving content of a treeview to a file and load it later</a>.</p>  <p>However, the Tag of all the nodes is lost using this method when de-serializing the file, or more likely, they are not even being serialized in the first place.</p>  <p>Is it possible to preserve the Tag value of the Nodes when serialized using this method? If so, how?</p>
