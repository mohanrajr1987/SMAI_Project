<p>New to WPF,C#,.Net here!</p>  <p>I'm working on a user interface to manage user privileges. I've decided to use a Treeview, witch I just got working. Almost 100% based on this "Load-On-Demand" solution: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/26288/Simplifying-the-WPF-TreeView-by-Using-the-ViewMode" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/26288/Simplifying-the-WPF-TreeView-by-Using-the-ViewMode</a></p>  <p>I've got the treeView working, but now I need to add something to show and edit data when I select an item in the treeview.  I imagine it should work like the "regedit", with a treeView on the left, and data on right.</p>  <p>The items in the treeview are not the same, so the data-view needs to change depending on the item selected.</p>  <p>I feel like I have all the handles, but my lack of skills can't put them together. I've tried using the <code>isSelected</code> property. but I come shot. </p>  <p>If you guys can give me an idea of what I need to do, I can read up on it. I think this guy might have the solution I need, but I guess I just don't understand what is going on there: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26338415/wpf-treeview-selected-item-and-showing-user-controls">WPF TreeView Selected Item and showing User Controls</a> </p>  <p>This has been my approach so far:</p>  <ul> <li>Creating a EditView UserControl for every TreeItem type</li> <li>Depending on the ItemType selected, load the specific <code>EditView</code> UserControl in to a GroupBox in the mainwindow. </li> <li>I get stuck in some non-static to static errors. </li> </ul>  <p>Any advice and pointers is appreciated :)</p>
