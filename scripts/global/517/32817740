<p>I am working in a public website and this website is developed in the Asp.Net. I am facing a strange problem in this website i.e. If I run through code in my system and local database than treeview expansion functionality which takes data from database is working fine but at the same time if I try to expand this tree view in publicly deployed website than it doesn't work.</p>  <p>But the strange thing is that when I connect to their Virtual private network through Citrix access gateway and than use this public website than expand functionality works fine. </p>  <p>Stored procedure called when this tree view expand is normal stored procedure which only takes input from the databse table through stored procedure.</p>  <p>Need help to figure out what can be the possible reasons.</p>
