<p>I need to make a list view filter like here <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0yL9fJt.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/0yL9fJt.png</a>?, Instead of Tree view <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9gmXzuV.png?1=" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/9gmXzuV.png?1=</a> , so when you choose from some of that list, like Rarity = Common, it would show all items/products, that have this attribute(Common)applied on them.  IM very new to Django,Oscar especialy, can someone help me in clearing this out ? Maybe there are allrdy some working solutions on that, i just don't know what to search for in google ? thx!</p>
