<p>Having trouble getting HotTracking to work with an OwnerDrawText TreeView. </p>  <p>Here is the code I have for drawing the node. I have tried using e.state and TreeNodeStates.Hot to no avail. This is the first time I have worked with an OwnerDraw object. </p>  <pre><code>Private Sub tree_DrawNode(sender As Object, e As DrawTreeNodeEventArgs)      If e.Node.Level = 1 Then         HideCheckBox(e.Node)         e.DrawDefault = True     Else         TextRenderer.DrawText(e.Graphics, e.Node.Text, e.Node.TreeView.Font, e.Bounds, Color.Black, Color.White)     End If  End Sub </code></pre>
