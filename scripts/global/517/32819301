<p>I'm looking for a way to tell if my <code>TreeView</code> has changed, i.e. any <code>TreeNode</code> has been added or removed from my <code>TreeNodeCollection</code>.</p>  <p>I've been looking at the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.treeview_events(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, but couldn't find any relevant event. I've also tried Google, but all I can find is about how to find out if the selection has changed.</p>  <p>Is there any event that I've missed or any way to implement it? In the worst case, I can always create a custom <code>TreeView</code> with a custom <code>TreeNodeCollection</code> and hide any relevant methods, but I'd rather not rely on this solution, especially since it could cause unwanted side-effects with <code>TreeView</code> extension methods.</p>
