<p>I've been trying to just hide items from a TreeView. I'm using a custom data type as source (called SettingsMenuItem) which inherits from FrameworkElement (currently FrameworkContentElement, because otherwise the TreeView renders them wrong).</p>  <p>My goal is by setting the <code>VisibilityProperty</code> of these FrameworkElements to either <code>Collapsed</code> or <code>Visible</code> that I'm able to hide certain items (including their children). I know that this can be done by deleting items from the source collection. But that's not what I want. It would mean that I have to mirror each collection in order to keep track of it's actual items, bind to each one in order to be notified about <code>Visibility</code>-changes and create a new collection each time one changes. A lot of overhead for this.</p>  <p>Right now I have no clue how I could accomplish that. I figure it's related to the ItemsGenerator, but I haven't seen any possibility to override it's behaviour. I thought TreeView would be able to detect Visibility, but obviously it doesn't. As alternative I thought of a custom TreeViewItem (maybe even TreeView if necessary) - but at this point the abstraction of this whole system overwhelms me. I don't know where to start and what is actually necessary to solve the problem.</p>  <p>Tips what I have to change or implement by myself would be more than enough. A complete solution would be nice.</p>
