<p>I need your opinion about UI and Databinding in WPF.</p>  <p>I had argue with my supervisor about UI &amp; databinding. There is A class, it has ObservableCollection of B class, and B class also has ObservableCollection of C class. These classes are used while communicating with NI CAN and LIN device(it is not case).</p>  <p>On the other hand, in user interface there are bunches of TreeView and DataGrids. There are several instances of A class which is used to store data from devices and files, and they are binded to Treeview and Datagrids. But, he disagrees with this, and says to make separate other list of variables for TreeView and Datagrid to data binding. As he says UI data and other must be separate and I agree with it. But, in this case there are several lists of lists of lists and for example: copy from one list to other list when there is change on data takes much time and calculation ( -> UI element ). And other problems also.</p>  <p>I need your your opinion or other advice to come out better solution.</p>  <p>Thank you!!</p>
