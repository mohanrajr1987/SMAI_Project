<p>We have a TreeView which we want to manually process CTRL-Arrow key combinations on.  However, the built-in behavior is to scroll the list without actually changing the selected item.</p>  <p>Is thee any way to disable this functionality so even when the control key is down, the arrows change the selected item?</p>  <p>Note: Yes, I know about the PreviewKeyDown function, but when I get the event and handle it, I'm not sure how to programmatically make the selection in the tree work as a user would expect. (i.e. respecting expanded or collapsed nodes, jumping from branch to branch, etc.)</p>
