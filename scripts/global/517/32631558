<p>I want to make my TreeView remember the selected items after <code>refresh/setInput</code>. (Let's pretend the Java TreeView doesn't remember the state). Since the TreeView will get setInput, so the element reference won't persist. </p>  <p>I am thinking to store the selected element by its full path in an <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>. (e.g. it looks like <code>["root_name", "2nd_level_name", "3rd_level_name", "node_name"]</code>). With the full path, I can locate the same element in the refreshed TreeView again.</p>  <p>I was wondering if there's any better way doing this? Or any existing libraries in Java can do this? </p>
