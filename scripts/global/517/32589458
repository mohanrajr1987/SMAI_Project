<p>I need to show items in a 2-level tree with virtualization especially on 2nd level. I want to show first level as vertical list and second level as wrap grid. Something like this:</p>  <p>Country 1</p>  <p>Company 1 Company 2</p>  <p>Company 3</p>  <p>Country 2</p>  <p>Company 4 Company 5</p>  <p>Company 6</p>  <p>What I've found so far.</p>  <ol> <li><p>ListBox and telerik:RadListBox support grouped CollectionViewSource but if i set <code>ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll=True</code> which is required for scrolling to work properly virtualization is disabled.</p></li> <li><p>telerik:RadTreeView supports virtualization but only if you use telerik:TreeViewPanel which supports only Vertical orientation while I need Horizontal. Even if I use telerik:VirtualizingWrapPanel virtualization is disabled. </p></li> <li><p>TreeView works only with VirtualizingStackPanel with Orientation set to Vertical. </p></li> </ol>  <p>I've seen some implementations of VirtualizingWrapPanel but they don't work on 2nd level probably because TreeView measures 2nd level item with height equals to infinity.</p>  <p>But 3. somehow works! Are there any other working solutions?</p>
