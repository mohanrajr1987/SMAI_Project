<p>I'm creating a model in Ruby/rails that uses the gem "active-rest_client" (<a href="https://github.com/whichdigital/active-rest-client" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/whichdigital/active-rest-client</a>). However my target server only 'speaks' HTTPS with a mismatched SSL cert. So I need to disable SSL verification when I query it (long story, just accept that).</p>  <p>The gem doesn't seem to have a native way to disable SSL verification. However, it relies on the faraday gem that can disable SSL verification (<a href="https://gist.github.com/mislav/938183" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/mislav/938183</a>).</p>  <p>When I do:</p>  <pre><code>ActiveRestClient::Base.faraday_config do |faraday|   faraday.ssl = false end </code></pre>  <p>It tells me that "ssl" is an undefined method.</p>  <p>Does anyone now a way?</p>  <p>Thanks for the help in advance!</p>
