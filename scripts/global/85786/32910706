<p>Rails 4.1.8. </p>  <p>So I have this thing:  </p>  <pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   after_save :weak, on: :create    def weak     puts "lamerino"   end end </code></pre>  <p>Right?  </p>  <p>So I fire rails console:  </p>  <pre><code>2.1.4 :008 &gt; post = Post.create(name: "slow")    (0.1ms)  begin transaction    SQL (0.1ms)  INSERT INTO "posts".... lamerino  post.name = "slow-mo" post.save  2.1.4 :014 &gt; post.save    (0.1ms)  begin transaction    SQL (0.2ms)  UPDATE "posts" SET ... lamerino </code></pre>  <p>As you can see "lamerino" was printed twice. For create and for update operations. Now, I only want this to be printed only for <code>create</code> operations. I thought that passing in <code>on: :create</code> will do that thing, but apparently it does not.</p>  <p>I ended up using <code>after_create :weak</code>. </p>  <p>I would like to know why updating record triggered the <code>after_save :weak, on: :create</code> callback.</p>
