<p>I am using Google Maps API.  When the page loads, it is supposed to load the map:</p>  <pre><code>google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize); </code></pre>  <p>This is working fine in Chrome, as far as I can tell.  However, it only works every other time in Safari when I press the BACK or FORWARD button on my browser.  In other words, when I load and reload the same page by pressing BACK: The first time, the map loads.  The second time, the map does not load and the page is missing the map.  The third time, I see the map.  The fourth time, I do not.  And so on.  The map loads fine in Safari when I click on the URL.</p>  <p>What might be the cause of this error?  And how can it be fixed?  My Safari version is 9.0.</p>
