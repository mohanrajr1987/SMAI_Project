<p>I have two models, one <code>Post</code> and <code>Genre</code>. I'm creating new post with given <code>genre_id</code>. What is the best way of validating if genre with given id exists? For now I'm validating presence of genre_id, but it's not enough. </p>  <p><code>validates :genre_id, presence: true</code></p>  <p>I know I can check whether the genre exists in a controller, but I would prefer to have this in my post validator object.</p>
