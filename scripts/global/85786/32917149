<p>I'm using intridea/omniauth and i'm trying to customize a single strategy to use https in a local environment.</p>  <p>My registered callback has to be <code>https</code>, but when I make the call it's always sending <code>http://localhost</code>.</p>  <p>I've tried changing the <code>:callback_path</code> and <code>:request_path</code> but that doesn't change http to https.</p>
