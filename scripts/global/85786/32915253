<p>I'm getting troubles to install spree. After installing all necessary gems, I launched the following commands :</p>  <pre><code>rails _4.2.2_ new my_store spree install my_store </code></pre>  <p>I didn't get any error message but when I launch "rails s", I get the spree homepage with nothing else but "No products found" message.</p>  <p>Any clue about what could be wrong ?</p>  <p>thanks</p>
