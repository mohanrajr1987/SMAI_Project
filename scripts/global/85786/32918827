<p>Since the implementation is very trivial, I would like to know your suggestion as how you will use Socialization gem to show "Posts" associated with a followed user. There wasn't a coherent description in the gem guide.</p>  <p>This is what I tried<br> <code>Post.where(id: current_user.followers.pluck(:id))</code><br> This throws an error<br> <code>wrong number of arguments (0 for 1..2)</code></p>  <p>Also, as suggested in the guide to show the follower/followee count, there is a strange output.<br> The count in the view starts off with <code>-2</code> and counts upwards from there.<br> Migration<br> <code>add_column :users, :followers_count, :integer, :default =&gt; 0</code><br> User model by devise</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
