<p>I want a variable that is globally accessible to the whole app. The user will fill a single input field form. It will be then saved into the database and that variable will be accessible anywhere. So here is what I have done so far.</p>  <pre><code>    class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base   # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.   # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.   protect_from_forgery with: :exception   before_action :save_page    def save_page     @page_name = params[:page_name ]     test_page_name = PageName.new     test_page_name.name = @page_name     if test_page_name.save       redirect_to(controller: 'template',action: 'templates')     end   end  end </code></pre>  <p>The form is submitted to save_page method in ApplicaitonController and after being saved it is redirected. Because this method will redirect in case of successfully saved into database, it is giving me problem. How can I fix this?</p>  <p>I also tried like this but no luck</p>  <pre><code>    class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base   # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.   # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.   protect_from_forgery with: :exception   before_action :page_name    def save_page     @page_name = params[:page_name ]     test_page_name = PageName.new     test_page_name.name = @page_name     if test_page_name.save       redirect_to(controller: 'template',action: 'templates')     end   end    def page_name     @user_page_name = @page_name   end  end </code></pre>  <p>but when I tried to print the value of @user_page_name in the view I got nothing.</p>
