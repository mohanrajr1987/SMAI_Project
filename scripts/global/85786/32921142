<p>I would like to implement the following logic:<br> We interact with our database through normal views. Through the views the basic CRUD operations can be performed on database objects. Whenever now a specific boolean (for any record) is set to true  i would like to pass this record to an REST API controller which then build a http string to be send to a known client.</p>  <p>In the model class i observe the needed value with a <code>after_update</code> callback</p>  <pre><code> private     def check_boolean         @listofusers ||= Array.new          if self.boolean_changed?              @listofusers.push(self)          end                  #redirect_to send_updates_path              #redirect_to :controller =&gt;'api/users',:action=&gt;"send_updates"       end </code></pre>  <p>This is the route i included in my <code>routes.rb</code> to get the named helper</p>  <pre><code>get 'send_updates', to: 'api/user#send_updates', as: :send_updates </code></pre>  <p>But i get the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>NoMethodError (undefined method `redirect_to' for #&lt;User:0x00000005abc778&gt;): </code></pre>  <p>What is the correct way to redirect to a controller action? Many thanks in advance.</p>
