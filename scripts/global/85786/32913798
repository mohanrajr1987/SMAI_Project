<p>If this is too broad I apologize and will understand if it needs closing. However, I couldn't find much to this specifically. Maybe I'm missing something obvious. My app is already setup to catch user name and email when signing up with email confirmation. I also want an email list though that is separate from signup. For instance, I want people to be able to just sign up to the mailing list without necessarily signing up as a user on the app with names and password. I also want users who have signed up to not necessarily be on the mailing list either if they don't want to. I'm just curious what the best way to go about doing this would be. Have a separate mailing list model with email and opt in opt out boolean? Or maybe allow subscribers to be users without first and last name? Is it bad practice to catch user emails in two different models? Thanks. </p>
