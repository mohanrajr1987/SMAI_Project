<p>For example, if I have a model <code>Item</code>, and I define resourceful routes for it, I must include <code>:delete</code> action as a member by hand, why is that?</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code># .../config/routes.rb  resources :items do   member { get :delete } end </code></pre>  <p>I need <code>:delete</code> action to display a confirmation dialog to users. Is there a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do? Or am I doing it right and it is the best practice?</p>
