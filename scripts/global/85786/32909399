<p>What is a good rails 4 rating gem? I tried ratyrate because almost everything else out there is outdated. Using ratyrate isn't that comfortable. </p>  <p>I want to display the average stars and number of ratings and below that have the user's current rating. I can't achieve that. After the user rates it doesn't go back to the average. </p>  <p>How can I retrieve the average myself?</p>
