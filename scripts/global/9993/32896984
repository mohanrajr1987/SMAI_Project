<p>I get the error when I declare the array. Why does this happen and how do I fix it? I can't seem to declare the array without throwing this error. I tried using vector&lt;> previously before this. I'm looking to create an array of strings. I've searched this error on google and for almost everyone I saw, it was a syntax error by switching around the code i.e "[]array" instead of "array[]". Here, I've put the array syntax in the correct order, but I still get this error. Thanks</p>  <pre><code>int main() {     const string case[3]; //&lt;- Error right here before 'case'     int selection; //choice to open skin     srand( time(0));     int skinChance; //The number that determines the skin quality     while(true)     {         cout &lt;&lt; "Open Case \n";         cin &gt;&gt; selection;         if(selection == 1)         {             skinChance = rand()%10;             if (skinChance &lt;= 5)             {                 //Blue Skin             }              else if (skinChance &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; skinChance &lt;= 9)             {                 //Purple/Pink Skin             }             else if (skinChance == 10)             {                 //Red Skin             }          }          else         {             cout &lt;&lt; "Not valid\n";         }     }    } </code></pre>
