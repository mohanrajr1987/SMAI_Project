<p>I am attempting to create a Swift version of <a href="https://github.com/nmattisson/DropdownMenu" rel="nofollow">this GitHub repository</a>. I started by doing a literal transfer of all the code from Objective-C to Swift, which caused a lot of errors (60 something in a 321 line file).</p>  <p>For this specific line of code</p>  <pre><code>self.currentViewController = self.childViewControllers.firstObject  </code></pre>  <p>I am getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>Value of type '[UIViewController]' has no member 'firstObject' </code></pre>  <p>I have tried adding <code>as! UIViewController</code>, and placing exclamation points and question marks at most of locations possible. None of the things I tried from the suggested posts helped.</p>
