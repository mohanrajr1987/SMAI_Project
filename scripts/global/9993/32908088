<p>I am starting out with Python and I just cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. This is an easy question for you to get a correct answer for!</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>def statement(x):     if x &gt; 50:         print("X is greater than 50")     elif x &lt; 50:         print("X is lower than 50")     else x == 50:         print("X is 50")     return </code></pre>  <p>Very simple I know. When I try and run this, it returns an error saying invalid syntax regarding the X in my else statement: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DEn3p.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DEn3p.png" alt="Screenshot from Python"></a></p>  <p>Could anybody please point me in the correct direction as to what I am doing wrong?</p>
