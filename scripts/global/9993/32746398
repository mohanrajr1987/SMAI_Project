<p>I go to run an acceptance test, but it only outputs  <code> Codeception PHP Testing Framework v2.0.12 Powered by PHPUnit 4.5.1 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors. </code> Then it quits with out any error message. No tests run, no error message. Browser tests were working fine, and only acceptance tests were broken.</p>  <p>I have all ready solved the problem, but I want to create a record for next time I or any one else runs into this problem.</p>  <p>If you codeception is quitting without any errors or fail messages, it means that there is an error in your code somewhere. I found the error in me Acceptance Helper file, where I had a duplicate of a function. Functions can not have the same name in php, so everything fails. But codeception does not output any error messages.</p>  <p>In order to solve this problem, you need to look through your Helper functions to find a syntax error, or it could be in your actual tests.  The reason it fails is codeception hits an error in the php code, and dies, not throwing any errors. Leaving you confused and frustrated. Now you can find this question and get back to doing what you're doing.</p>  <p>YAY! </p>
