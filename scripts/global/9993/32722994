But there is always the same error occuring.I also search trough web but I didn't get a solution. THANK YOU FOR HELPING!!</p>  <p>ERROR:  </p>  <pre><code>File "C:/progetti/main.py", line 5 SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xe8' in file C:/progetti/main.py on line 5, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details   SCRIPT:  x = 5 y = 8  if x &gt; y:     print("x è maggiore di y") elif x &lt; y:     print("x è minore di y") else:     print("sono uguali") </code></pre>  <p>I couldn't fix the error.
