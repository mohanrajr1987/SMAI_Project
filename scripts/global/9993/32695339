<p>Is ther any way to declare variable like this:</p>  <pre><code>private String xmlns:xsi;  </code></pre>  <p>Resulting into the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Syntax error on token ":", , expected </code></pre>  <p>But, I want to have <strong>':'</strong> in my variable name. It is mandatory.</p>  <p><em>It is mandatory because I am using jaxb api to unmarshal my xml file to Java. In the XML I have an element with attribute named xmlns:xsi. Now, in the POJO I have to use this attribute as a variable to store the value. That's why it is mandatory for me to have the variable name like this.</em></p>
