<p>I am having a ridiculous error trying to run this ruby code.  I have a method defined like this:</p>  <pre><code>def testset_query(id)   hash = Hashtable.new   records = read_record(...)   names = [x,y,z,a,b,c]   i = 0   record.each { |rec|     hash[names[i]] = rec     i++   }   return hash end </code></pre>  <p>On the line with the closing bracket, line 9 above, I get: syntax error, unexpected '}' (SyntaxError) Two lines later: syntax error, unexpected keyword_end, expecting '}'</p>  <p>Ridiculous.  I have no idea how to handle this because the code looks totally fine to me.  Please help</p>
