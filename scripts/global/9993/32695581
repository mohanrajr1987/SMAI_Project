<p>I am trying to make a program that calculates the area of a triangle given the values for all three sides. When I run my program with my runner file my area comes out to " 0.0"  </p>  <p>Here is the classes full code (also I know I did the same code for setSides and triangle but my instructor gave us this shell and I didn't know what to put in there)</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;  import java.lang.Math.*;  public class Triangle {  private int sideA;  private int sideB;  private int sideC;  private double theArea;   private double s;   private double perimeter;    public Triangle()  {      sideA = 1;      sideB = 1;      sideC = 1;  }   public Triangle(int a, int b, int c)  {    sideA = (int) a;    sideB = (int) b;    sideC = (int) c;     }    public void setSides(int a, int b, int c)  {    sideA = (int) a;    sideB = (int) b;    sideC = (int) c;  }   private double calcPerimeter()  {   double perimeter = sideA + sideB + sideC;         return perimeter;  }    private double calcArea()  {   double s = calcPerimeter() / 2;   double theArea = (Math.sqrt(s * (s - sideA) * (s - sideB) * (s - sideC)));    return theArea;  }   public void print()  {     System.out.println("Area == " + theArea);   } } </code></pre>
