<p>My website Has SEVERAL external javascript files. One just to hold the arrays, one for menu functions to effect buttons, one specifically for user logins, one for functions that generate output to forms. SOOOOOO many of these are intertwined that I have had to creatively shuffle, their order. I still get undefined errors at times. But 2-3 seconds later after a page refresh, They work, but I get an "undefined" error on another page that was previously working. Is it possible... or lets say "Practical" to set the ENTIRE website inside an onLoad statement? I have many functions that do not execute until you click a button, but they have variable results as well.</p>
