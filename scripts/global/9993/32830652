<p>I have a relatively straightforward sql query which refuses to execute on sqldeveloper, I've narrowed down the offending line to this -</p>  <pre><code>and (b.date_updated &gt; (sysdate MINUS 2) or a.date_updated &gt; (sysdate MINUS 2)) </code></pre>  <p>This is a part of my <code>where</code> clause along with other statements.</p>  <p>I've visually counted the parenthesis multiple times and it looks balanced to me, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here, can someone help me figure out what's wrong here.</p>  <p>For completeness, here's what the where clause looks like</p>  <pre><code>where a.customer_id = b.customer_id and (b.date_updated &gt; (sysdate MINUS 2) or a.date_updated &gt; (sysdate MINUS 2)) and a.c_id = c.c_id  </code></pre>
