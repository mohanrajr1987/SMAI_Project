<p>I am relatively new to java and am coding a game. It was going quite well until I ran into an error under a } and a ; saying</p>  <pre><code>Syntax error, insert "}" to complete Statement  </code></pre>  <p>(with a ; for the ;). I am wondering what creates syntax errors, what are they and how are they fixed. I would apreciate any feedback and understand if this is a dumb question. Thanks.</p>
