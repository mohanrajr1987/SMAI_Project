<p>I'm currently wrestling with my inner class <code>DateTest</code>. This error message appears after compiling, and I haven't been able to figure out how to fix the bug. I've gone through many lines of code to work out the test class in trying an effort to print out all twelve cases of the switch block in the Date class. </p>  <p>Below I've included the errors and my code. Also might be worth mentioning that I'm writing this in an online IDE, browxy, and double checking in CodeChef. </p>  <p>Compilation Errors Detected Line: 33 class expected</p>  <p>This is my code: </p>  <pre><code> public class Date {      public static int daysInMonth ( int month) {            /** method uses a switch block and takes in a month number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and returns the number of days in a month. **/  switch (month) {     case 1:     case 3:     case 5:     case 7:     case 8:     case 10:     case 12:         return 31;          break;     case 2:         return 28;         break;     case 4:     case 6:     case 9:     case 11:         return 30;         break;     default:          System.out.println("Invalid month.");         break;     }     return month; }  public class DateTest {      /*test class that prints out 12 lines like: "January is 31 days long.", "February...", etc.*/       int month; /*compilation error reads "class expected" for this line*/  public static void main (String [] args) {     month = Date.daysInMonth(1);         System.out.println("January is " +month+  " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(2);         System.out.println("February is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(3);         System.out.println("March is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(4);         System.out.println("April is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(5);         System.out.println("May is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(6);         System.out.println("June is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(7);         System.out.println("July is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(8);         System.out.println("August is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(9);         System.out.println("September is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(10);         System.out.println("October is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(11);         System.out.println("November is " +month+ " days long.");     month = Date.daysInMonth(12);         System.out.println("December is " +month+ " days long.");     } } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>(As an aside: This is the first question I've asked here, so I hope it's clear. Also, I've only recently begun learning Java and am doing it almost completely on my own, so any advice you might have to offer is very welcome.)</p>
