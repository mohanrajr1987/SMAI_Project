<p>Not sure if this is a php/mysql bug however whenever I try to update a Column through PHP I get the following error 'Unknown column 'tablename.columnname' in 'field list'... just to make sure I typed up different variations of UPDATE queries directly on Terminal to test the syntax and they work fine, when I do the same through PHP the same error message..</p>  <p>CURRENTLY I'm trying to run this following query.</p>  <pre><code>$updateSTKLISTVol = "UPDATE STKLIST AS A INNER JOIN (SELECT SYMBOL, VOLUME FROM $tablename WHERE id ='1') AS B ON A.SYMBOL = B.SYMBOL SET A.VOLUME=B.VOLUME"; $result5    = mysqli_query($dbcon, $updateSTKLISTVol) or die(mysqli_error($dbcon)); </code></pre>  <p>the error return is... </p>  <p>"Unknown column 'A.VOLUME' in 'field list' "</p>  <p>I would appreciate any guidance, thank you in advance. </p>
