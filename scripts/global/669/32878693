<p>I have a bit of an unusual environment, where the client does not want to support SharePoint components, and as such I have an O365 SharePoint site that I can only do things programmatically through workflows or JavaScript.  </p>  <p>I have workflows that are starting tasks, except for some reason I occasionally get a task that does not get the "Related Items" populated.  Because of this, my lookup to find the items with a task associated with them failed, because I was looking for the Related Item to be the ID I was working with.  I can still follow from the list item, to the workflow, to the task.  Is there another way, using something like WorkflowItemId, that I can associate the tasks to these items?</p>
