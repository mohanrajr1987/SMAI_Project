<p>I would first of all like to find out if anyone has successfully implemented this Code sample - SharePoint-to-LinkedIn connector on this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff512786(v=office.14).aspx" rel="nofollow">link</a>. Kindly help out with details on how to get it to work. I am currently stuck with a "file not found" error message when I launch the URL after deploying the solution successfully from Visual Studio 2010 which refers to the DotNetOpenAuth library and therefore I am unable to see the LinkedIn opt-in page. I downloaded the code sample from the link and just edited the SharePoint server URL to my own.</p>  <p>Please help. My client really wants this feature as part of their social media collaboration phase using SharePoint.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
