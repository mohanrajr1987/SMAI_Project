<p>When I run the following in a windows cmd prompt, I am able to  upload a file to a SharePoint document library:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>net use F: "<a href="http://share.sitename.com/TestDocumentLibrary/" rel="nofollow">http://share.sitename.com/TestDocumentLibrary/</a>" &amp; copy \\networkdrive\test.txt F:\somefile.txt</p> </blockquote>  <p>I need to first use <code>net use</code> to map the network drive in order to upload the file. This works fine on my local machine (where I am an administrator). </p>  <p>I am attempting to do something similar on a remote machine. However, the user account is not an administrative user on that machine - the process executing on that machine is delegated to it.</p>  <p>As a result, the above fails.</p>  <p>I have tried to add my personal username/password into the net use command for testing purposes, but this doesn't seem to work - it looks like this is needed for access to the linked site, not the current system (since the net use requires the admin account to work).</p>  <p>I have also tried just directly copying:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>copy \\networkdrive\test.txt \share.sitename.com\TestDocumentLibrary\somefile.txt</p> </blockquote>  <p>But receive  "System cannot find the path specified" as an error. This error is what ultimately drove me to use <code>net use</code> in the first place.</p>  <p>I am completely fine mapping the drive only for purposes of the cmd session (this would probably be preferable, actually).</p>  <p>Are there other options to accomplish what I am trying to do?</p>
