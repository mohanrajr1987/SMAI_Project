<p>For Creating the SharePoint Farm i followed the provided guide by Microsoft (Azure preview portal) <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-sharepoint-farm-azure-preview/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-sharepoint-farm-azure-preview/</a></p>  <p>But after a successfull Deployment I'm unable to access my SharePoint Site. When trying to connect to the SHAREPOINTSITEURL i always get the IIS standard screen with references to Windows Server and Microsoft . Using the SHAREPOINTCENTRALADMINURL provides nothing either. Any Ideas how to solve it? Did I miss some configurations?</p>
