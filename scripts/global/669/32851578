<p>so right now I have 2 files. A batch file that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>open http://kmsbs/Shared%20Documents/ username password option confirm off cd C:\Users\a\Desktop\ put "C:\Users\a\Desktop\Contract.pdf" quit </code></pre>  <p>and a cmd file that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>ftp -s:c:\Users\a\Desktop\upload.bat pause </code></pre>  <p>My goal here is to upload a file to my intranet site using the batch file so i can then schedule the task manager to automatically run this file every day. When i run the cmd file, it says unknown host <a href="http://kmsbs/Shared%20Documents/" rel="nofollow">http://kmsbs/Shared%20Documents/</a> I was wondering if anyone knows why I'm getting this error. Thanks.</p>
