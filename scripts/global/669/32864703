<p>We have our own binary document format for our software. We want to reproduce the experience in SharePoint of opening/editing an Office Document. ie:</p>  <ul> <li>prompt 'read only' or 'check out and edit' when opening</li> <li>progress on opening</li> <li>editing 'in-situ', eg no local download of the file</li> <li>saving/saving as back to SP with prompt for versioning etc.</li> </ul>  <p>the user experience should be stable across as many versions of SP as possible</p>  <p>q: does the opendocuments control adapt to any fileformat? or is it office only? q: does the opendocuments control provide the in-out prompts, above? q: if so, specifically what server-side configurations are required? q: with experience, is there a better approach? if so, what should the client code interact with in the SP api?</p>  <p>A concise suggested strategy would be nice.</p>
