<p>You know that when a user makes a research on a SharePoint site, he can create an alert notifying him when <strong>new items in search result appear</strong> OR <strong>existing items are changed</strong>. But this system of alerts takes in account only the searched words. I want to know if it's possible that it takes into account the <strong>filters</strong> specified by the user while making his research, and how to do that.</p>  <p>Thanks. Waelos</p>
