<p>I currently have an excel file that produces client statements. I need to track who has run their statements. Currently, whenever statements are produced I have a macro that send me an email with their user name.  However people running on a Thin Client system they get a prompt;</p>  <p>'A program is trying to send an email message on your behalf...'</p>  <p>IS there some way I can get rid of this prompt and still send the email, or has anyone got any other ideas on how to track usage.  I share the file through Share Point.  So that might have some capabilities?</p>  <p>Thank you  </p>
