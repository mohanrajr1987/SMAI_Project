<p>I have created an excel chart(having a slicer) through a powerpivot table using an external data(SQL) source. It works fine.</p>  <p>But, if I display it using an "excel web access webpart" to my SharePoint 2013 site, it gets displayed but, throws an error when the slicer is used for filtering.</p>  <p>The error it throws is </p>  <blockquote>   <p>An error occurred while working on the data model in the excel workbook</p> </blockquote>
