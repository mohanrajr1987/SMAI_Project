<p>I'm writing some app using sharepoint 2013 and VS 2013.</p>  <p>I've created some simple list (title and description).</p>  <p>I've added list to .aspx page using:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;WebPartPages:XsltListViewWebPart runat="server" ListUrl="Lists/Projects_List" IsIncluded="True" NoDefaultStyle="TRUE" Default="False"&gt;&lt;/WebPartPages:XsltListViewWebPart&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Everything  is OK when list is empty. If i add first item to list, instead of it i recieve error:  "Unable to display this Web Part. To troubleshoot the problem, open this Web page in a Microsoft SharePoint Foundation-compatible HTML editor such as Microsoft SharePoint Designer. If the problem persists, contact your Web server administrator."</p>  <p>Ive checked page many times, using VS and Sharepoint Designer, but everything looks OK - i have no idea what's wrong.</p>
