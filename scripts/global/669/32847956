<p>I have a form setup in a webpart in our SharePoint solution and am having an issue when testing on Apple devices where the input fields are not accessible/appear to be grayed out.  This application uses ajax server calls to pre-fill form entries and I am using AngularJS for client-side handling.  Why is this only happening on these devices?</p>  <p>example field:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input id="nhaole-vf-address" ng-model="parent.streetAddress" type="text" class="form-control" required /&gt; </code></pre>
