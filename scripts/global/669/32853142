<p>I've created a calendar in SharePoint 2013 that lists Class Title, Class Date, Class Description, and Class time.</p>  <p>I've also created an InfoPath 2013 form so that student can sign up for those class when then links back to a SharePoint list.</p>  <p>What I've been trying to do is create one drop-down box that lists the classes in the drop-down field. Once a class is selected, I want it to auto-fill the Class Description field and the Date and Time fields.</p>  <p>I currently have the drop-down which does work just fine. It queries the data and returns the expected results.</p>  <p>I've tried creating a series of rules and coupling them with functions, but they all end in just blank fields... or sometimes they break the form completely.</p>  <p>I've been all over the Internet (including MSDN and TechNet trying to find an answer, but either I'm asking the question wrong, or I'm using the wrong keywords, because mostly what I've been getting is creating cascading drop-down lists... This is different.</p>  <p>Do you have any suggestions or a good link I can go to that might have this info?</p>
