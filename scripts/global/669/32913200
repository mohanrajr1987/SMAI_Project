<p>Good afternoon all,</p>  <p>I've been tasked with the integration of our Company's Microsoft Dynamics CRM and SharePoint 2013. I have found plenty of helpful ways to pull SharePoint data TO the CRM, and I've also been successful in pushing data from the CRM to SharePoint, although the latter is not working as desired.</p>  <p><strong>CRM Test Data:</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VHoKP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VHoKP.png" alt="CRM Test Data"></a></p>  <p><br /> <br /> <strong>When pushed to SharePoint, displays like so:</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HI7Pt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HI7Pt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My goal is to sync our accounts and contacts from the CRM to a list on SharePoint as list items. Thus far I've only been able to push the data and create folders on the SharePoint with the same names (See above). The SP list can be as simple as just the Name field for Accounts.</p>  <p>My other problem is the fact that I have to manually push the CRM data to the SharePoint list when creating new accounts on the CRM. Is there a way to automate this? First thoughts are a workflow on the CRM that syncs when a new account is created.</p>  <p><strong>TL/DR Summary:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Need the CRM to create list items within a matching list on SharePoint</li> <li>SharePoint only needs to have read abilities from the CRM</li> <li>CRM data needs to refresh/sync to the SharePoint list automatically</li> </ul>
