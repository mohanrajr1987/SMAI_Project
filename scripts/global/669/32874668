<p>When an employee leaves the company, we want to have all email forwarded to a colleague to avoid communication lapses, especially with clients. We would like to place the forwarding rule on the account through a SharePoint workflow with a call to the EWS REST API. </p>  <p>I tried a few Google searches and ended up finding some related methods in the API docs, but the closest thing I could find was a command to forward a message directly. </p>  <p>Is there a sane way to do what I'm trying to do, specifically with a REST call? I know this could be set up by Net Ops at the admin level, but we have a specific requirement to do this with a SP workflow. I'm fairly new to SharePoint and web APIs, so any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>FWIW, we are on SharePoint 2013 and Office 365 Exchange.</p>
