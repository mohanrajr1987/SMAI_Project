<p>Firstly, I'm not sure if this is best here or in Super User, or both - so apologies.</p>  <p>The objective of my project is to develop interactive documents using core web technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript. These documents are not necessarily destined for the public web - they may need to be private (e.g. on a corporate intranet) with controlled access. These are designed to be more "standalone" documents (like an MS Word doc) which happen to be written in HTML, rather than typical public webpages.</p>  <p>The question I am grappling with is whether and how common cloud storage / collaboration / document management services (Dropbox, Sharepoint / OneDrive, Google Drive etc.) can and should be used to store these HTML files, particularly so that access control and sharing / collaboration features can be applied. </p>  <hr>  <p>More info:</p>  <p>Ideally, I want to understand to what extent each service can be used to:</p>  <ul> <li>Store the HTML, CSS and JS files (they can all do this as you'd expect)</li> <li>Browse and navigate the HTML pages in a browser as if they were any other website</li> <li>Provide access control (i.e. using their "sharing" features)</li> <li>Provide other document management features (versioning, commenting etc.)</li> <li>Basic editing (without downloading, editing and re-uploading)</li> </ul>  <p>What I've found so far (not being an expert in any of these services):</p>  <ol> <li><p><strong>Dropbox</strong></p>  <ul> <li>The Dropbox client on my Mac opens and renders the HTML in a browser as expected!  </li> <li>But on the web, Dropbox displays a preview of the un-styled HTML in an iFrame</li> <li>It will render the HTML directly if it has a "share link" by manually editing the url to dl.dropboxusercontent.com/<em>docid</em>/<em>file.html</em></li> <li>... but it will not find the external files (JS, CSS, images, etc.) unless they have absolute URLs.</li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>MS OneDrive / SharePoint</strong></p>  <ul> <li>I have an Office 365 subscription, so have been playing around with it.</li> <li>Although I can upload all the files to various places: document libraries, sites, folders, etc., the HTML downloads when clicked on instead of being rendered in a browser.</li> <li>Similar question here: <a href="http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/123213/new-page-with-custom-html-content">http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/123213/new-page-with-custom-html-content</a>.</li> <li>It might be possible, but I might need to learn SharePoint.</li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>Google Drive</strong></p>  <ul> <li>People with access rights to the HTML can render it in a browser via a URL like www.googledrive.com/host/<em>docid</em></li> <li>This "hosting" service is being deprecated from 2016. <a href="http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/deprecating-web-hosting-support-in.html" rel="nofollow">Link</a></li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>So, to summarise, my question:</p>  <ul> <li>Are there any cloud services that can be used with "standalone" HTML+CSS+JS documents just as they can with other documents (.docx, .pptx, etc.), and give a good user experience?</li> </ul>  <p>At the moment, my research suggests not - the user experience is too clunky, and so I may need to host the HTML documents on web servers somewhere, and implement my own access control &amp; doc management solution.</p>  <p>If anyone has any other suggestions / solutions for implementing access control / doc management for HTML pages, please let me know.</p>
