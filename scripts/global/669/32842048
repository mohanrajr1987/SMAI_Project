<p>I have created a SharePoint 2013 solution(VS2012) and deployed a form in the layouts folder of 15 hive and attached the form as New Form for multiple lists. The form has a file upload control and its upload functionality is restricted only to upload PDF files.The form has 3 tabs and a user is allowed to move to tab 2/3 only if the full tab 1 section is completed otherwise it will give alert messages. Now, if an user uploads an <strong>XPS converted PDF</strong> file in the first tab, and then moves to the second tab it  shows the message "Upload a document before proceeding" and the form gets distorted even if the document was uploaded earlier. <strong>This scenario is occurring in our load balanced Stage environment(2 Application, 2 WFE) but it is working fine in Dev. environment(Single Server Farm).</strong></p>  <p>I have tried adding ULS logging in my code with a specific Event ID and Category and could notice that the values of every field in the form is going null on page post back(happening only for those xps converted PDFs).</p>  <p>Please help me out with a solution. Thanks a lot in advance.</p>
