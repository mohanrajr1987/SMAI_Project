<p>I'm completely new to Sharepoint so keep that in mind when answering or assuming things.</p>  <p>Anyways, we have a CRM 2015 Online Update 1 and Sharepoint Online and those are integrated (not by me). Now when an end-user goes to Account -> Documents the CRM will automatically ask if the user wants to create a folder to Sharepoint. That's fine, but naming convention seems to be "AccountName_AccountGuid". We would like to change that to "AccountName_OurOwnID" where OurOwnID is a custom field in CRM that is unique for every account.</p>  <p>So my question is how would one do this?</p>  <p>EDIT: All I can think of now is to create a plugin that'll be launched when ever a sharepointdocumentlocation entity is created and basically create a new folder with wanted name and then delete the original folder in Sharepoint and then connect the new folder with sharepointdocumentlocation.</p>  <p>Sub-question: Is there a way to tell CRM to stop asking if the user wants to create a new folder? In my case it's unwanted feature but since it is there at least we should make sure that names of the folders will be ok.</p>
