<p>WHen I make any modifications in seattle.master, I see that all the authenticated users are able to see the changes. However, when I am an anonymous user, I do not see any changes, it seems like seattle.master is never used for anonymous users. The problem is I could not find which master page is used for anonymous users. I even tried to modify all the master pages in SP Designer 2013 one by one (Yea brute force:)), but nothing changed. Is there anyone that can give me a clue about this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <ul> <li>SharePoint 2013 is used.</li> </ul>
