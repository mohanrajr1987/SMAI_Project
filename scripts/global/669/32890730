<p>In my database (Access 2013, .accdw), I am checking the user's current version in the Form_Open event.  If it is not up to date it triggers an external command to download a fresh copy and then is supposed to close itself to allow for the update.  The problem is that after Application.Quit is triggered, access closes but instantly reopens, blocking the download.  I've stripped out all the code I can to isolate the problem.</p>  <pre><code>If 1 = 1 Then Application.Quit End If </code></pre>  <p>Simplified pretty far, right?  It should always just close as soon as the form is opened.  With this as the only code in my Form_Open event which is the only code in the form, it still closes, reopens, and then closes again.  Docmd.Quit has the same effect.  I've tried too many variations to enumerate.  In a button this code works fine, but I need it to run the check before it loads any data (the linked tables may be being altered while we change versions).  Any ideas how to make it stay closed the first time it closes?</p>
