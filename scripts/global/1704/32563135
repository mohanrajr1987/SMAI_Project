<p>I want to insert my ipython terminal session in to a text file. The usual way of <code>ipython &gt;&gt; test.txt</code> does not work and collect too much garbage.</p>  <p>Preferably I am looking for some thing that does not require the use of this <code>test.txt</code> or some intermediary file. </p>  <p>I have seen quite a number of Ipython's code snippets. How do they do it? More specifically I am writing some handouts in <code>latex</code> using <code>vim</code> and would need frequent insertion of of such sessions. Through <code>vim</code> I also tried <code>:r!ipython</code>, but it does not work and too much garbage.</p>
