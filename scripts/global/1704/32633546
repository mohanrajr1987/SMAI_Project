<p>I want to pretty print an anonymous function, so I found the function <code>latex</code> (which only takes symbolic expressions) to do this:</p>  <pre><code>f =@(x,a) (x/a) * exp(-x.^2 / (2*a^2)); latex(sym(f)) </code></pre>  <p>which outputs:</p>  <pre><code>\frac{x\, \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2\, a^2}}}{a} </code></pre>  <p>However, the above LaTeX syntax is <strong>not</strong> in the way I originally entered in the function. I would like the LaTeX syntax to appear in the same fashion I originally wrote it out, like the following:</p>  <pre><code>\frac{x}{a} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2\, a^2}} </code></pre>  <p>I'd also be willing to start with a string. Is there a way to do this in MATLAB?</p>
