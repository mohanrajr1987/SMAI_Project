<p>I write documentation in markdown using ViM and I also put math using the latex <code>$$</code> symbol (I compile using pandoc). The thing is that ViM syntax wouldn't ignore the underscores <code>_</code> inside the dollar symbols and it is pretty annoying. For instance if I write this:</p>  <p><code>$$ a_1 = 0 $$</code></p>  <p>Then Vim will highlight all the following text as italics due to to the underscore used.</p>  <p>How can I change that?</p>  <p>Also it would be nice if I could highlight what's inside <code>$</code> with a different format.</p>
