<p>I have a roblem with LaTex involving the hyperref package. Consider the following example:</p>  <pre><code>\documentclass{scrartcl} \usepackage{hyperref}  \begin{document}  \tableofcontents  \section{Some section}  \section*{Some starred section} \label{starred-section} \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\hyperref[starred-section]{Starred section}}  \end{document} </code></pre>  <p>I use XeLaTex to compile this which works perfectly fine but there is one minor problem with the output, I posted a screenshot below. The pdf itself looks completely fine, but the table of contents AS DISPLAYED BY THE PDF VIEWING PROGRAM (preview on mac in my case) is screwed up by hyperref, see the red box. I checked whether this is an issue of preview, but Adobe reader displays the table of contents in the same way. Does anyone know a solution to that? Thank you! <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/euOGE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/euOGE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
