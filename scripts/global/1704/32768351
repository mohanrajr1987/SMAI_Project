<p>My document will compile when the leader key is left as "\" but if I change it to "\&lt; Space >" (ignore the space on either side of "Space") or " " , my document won't compile. Here's how I've set it along with how I'm compiling it (.vimrc).</p>  <pre><code>let mapleader = "\&lt;Space&gt;" nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;ll :w&lt;CR&gt;:!latexmk -pdf %&lt;CR&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It works on my ubuntu 14.04 partition and mac but not my Arch linux partition.</p>
