<p>I am running Sublime Text 3 with LaTeXTools installed. When I build my LaTeX file, it compiles with no problem, and the PDF even shows up. However, nothing in the PDF is updated, no matter how much I change the LaTeX file. How can I fixe this? Here is my texpath in the LaTeXTools.sublime-settings file:</p>  <pre><code>"texpath" : "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MiKTeX 2.9\\miktex\\bin\\", </code></pre>  <p>And here is the line for SumatraPDF:</p>  <pre><code>"sumatra": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SumatraPDF\\SumatraPDF.exe", </code></pre>  <p>Any help appreciated!</p>
