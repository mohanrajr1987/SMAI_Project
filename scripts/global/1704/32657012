<p>I'm working on an RMarkdown document and am running across a strange issue.</p>  <p>My document currently has three chunks, the first one is a table, the second a ggplot, and the third another table being produced using the knitr kable function.</p>  <p>The problem comes in the third chunk. For some reason when I knit to pdf the first column name is blocked by a black box. What makes it even stranger is that it only blocks it the first time the column name appears (the table stretches across two pages) I can't figure out why this is happening or how to remove the box.</p>  <p>My settings are as follows</p>  <p>yaml header:</p>  <pre><code>title: '' graphics: yes header-includes: - \usepackage{graphicx} - \usepackage{fancyhdr} - \fancyfoot[LE,RO]{SIG} - \usepackage{xcolor} - \usepackage{colortbl} output: html_document params:   client: //filepath1.csv   clientname: clientname   clientsummary: //filepath2.csv   refdate: 09/11/2015 tables: yes geometry: margin=2.25cm </code></pre>  <p>chunk code:</p>  <pre><code>```{r kable, echo=FALSE,results='asis', warning=FALSE} options(scipen=4,digits=2) cftest &lt;- read.csv(params$client) cftest$TradeDate=(as.Date(cftest$TradeDate,"%m/%d/%Y")) cftest$noticeDate=(as.Date(cftest$noticeDate,"%m/%d/%Y")) cftest=na.omit(cftest[order(cftest$TradeDate),]) cftest$TradeDate=(as.character(cftest$TradeDate)) cftest$noticeDate=(as.character(cftest$noticeDate))           library(knitr) library(xtable) library(gridExtra) library(pander) library(plyr)  cftest$OriginalAmount=format((cftest$OriginalAmount/1000000),big.mark = ",") my.df=cftest[,c(1,3,6,9)] kable(my.df,digits=2,row.names = FALSE,col.names=c("Notice Date","Amount ($M)","Trade Date","Manager"),caption="Possible Distributions") </code></pre>  <p>If it helps I tried creating the table with xtable to see if that solved the problem but it does not. The black bar appears on the first column name as well.</p>  <p>I googled around for a while and it seems some people have a black bock appear on latex documents due to an overfull error but I don't see how that would be the case here,</p>  <p>I'm pretty perplexed by this, anyone have any thoughts?</p>  <p>p.s.</p>  <p>cftest is just a data frame with mixed data, numbers and text.</p>
