<p>I am writing a code to export a summary statistics table in Latex by using <code>tabstat, by()</code> and <code>esttab</code>.</p>  <p>Here you have a toy example that replicates the structure of my data:</p>  <pre><code>cls clear all set more off  use auto, clear  // Create two groups to be used in the -by()- option gen rep2="First dataset" if rep78&gt;=3 replace rep2="Second dataset" if rep78&lt;3   // Recode "price" as completely missing in the first group replace price=. if rep2=="First dataset"    // Table eststo: estpost tabstat weight price mpg trunk, ///     column(statistics) statistics(count mean median sd) by(rep2) nototal  local sum_statistics "count(label(Observations)) mean(label(Mean) fmt(2)) p50(label(Median)) sd(label(Standard deviation) fmt(2))"  esttab using "table1.tex", replace type ///     title("Summary Statistics")  ///     cells("`sum_statistics'") ///        noobs nonum booktabs </code></pre>  <p>The output displays summary statistics into two subtables, one for each dataset (as defined by <code>rep2</code>). These two datasets don't necessarily have the same variables: <code>price</code> is completely missing from the first dataset.</p>  <p>I would like to entirely omit the row of summary statistics of <code>price</code> for "First dataset" only (leaving it for "Second dataset").  This because since the variable <code>price</code> is missing for "First dataset", all its summary statistics are missing values.  This is equivalent to omit the entire row of summary statistics in case "Observations" is equal to 0 in the specific by-group.</p>  <p>I looked into the documentation of <code>tabstat</code> but I am not quite sure about how to proceed. Do I have to use the <code>drop()</code> option of <code>estout</code>?</p>  <p>Many thanks, S</p>
