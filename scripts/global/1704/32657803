<p>I would like to use a different template than the default defined for documentclass: book such as the <code>wileySix</code>. Would that be possible? Maybe by including <code>in_header: file.tex</code> and inside such file I could define <code>\documentclass{wileySix}</code>? </p>  <p>Then basically I have here two question: </p>  <ol> <li><p>Would a pdf document created from R Markdown be compatible with different documentclass for books? </p></li> <li><p>and if the answer is "yes, by declaring the <code>\documentclass</code> inside a file.tex and calling/including it by your YAML", as I have never used the file.tex, how would I could do that? any help is very welcome</p></li> </ol>
