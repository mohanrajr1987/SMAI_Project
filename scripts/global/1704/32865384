<p>While <code>xtable()</code> has a <code>sanitize.text.function</code> argument which allows to sanitize strings with special charaters to stop LaTeX compilation from breaking in Sweave/knitr documents, the package does not export the function to the userspace. </p>  <p>How can I sanitize strings like <code>asdf_text</code> outside of the <code>xtable</code> context, so as to have it transformed to something like <code>asdf\_text</code>? (If possible I would prefer a small, self-contained solution.)</p>
