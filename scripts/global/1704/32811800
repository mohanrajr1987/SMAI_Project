<p>Behind this question is an effort to extract all references created by <code>knitr</code> and <code>latex</code>.  Not finding another way, my thought was to read into R the .Rnw script and use a regular expression to find references -- where the latex syntax is <code>\ref{caption referenced to}</code>.  My script has 250+ references, and some are very close to each other.</p>  <p>The text.1 example below works, but not the text example.  I think it has to do with R chugging along to the final closing brace.  How do I stop at the first closing brace and extract what preceded it to the opening brace?</p>  <pre><code>library(stringr) text.1 &lt;- c(" \\ref{test}", "abc", "\\ref{test2}", " \\section{test3}", "{test3") # In the regular expression below, look back and if find "ref{", grab everything until look behind for } at end # braces are special characters and require escaping with double backslacs for R to recognize them as braces # unlist converts the list returned by str_extract to a vector  unlist(str_extract_all(string = text.1, pattern = "(?&lt;=ref\\{).*(?=\\}$)")) [1] "test"  "test2"  # a more complicated string, with more than one set of braces in an element text &lt;- c("text \ref{?bar labels precision} and more text  \ref{?table column alignment}", "text \ref{?table space} }")  unlist(str_extract_all(string = text, pattern = "(?&lt;=ref\\{).*(?=\\}$)")) character(0) </code></pre>
