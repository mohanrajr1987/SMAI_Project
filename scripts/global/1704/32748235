<p>I want to export a .Rmd file primarily as a latex pdf.</p>  <p>This is the code that I'm currently using</p>  <pre><code>```{r ,fig.cap="caption",fig.env='figure', fig.width=10, fig.height=10,echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE, strip.white=TRUE} library(png) library(grid) img &lt;- readPNG("filepath/overview.png") grid.raster(img) ``` </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, I'm already using <code>strip.white=TRUE</code> &amp; <code>fig.env='figure'</code> but they don't seem to work. The .PNG file hasn't got any (white) spacing above or below the image.</p>  <p>I know I can use latex directly and achieve what I want, but I want to able to reproduce this in Word if needed. Also in Word, there's half a page empty space above and below the image.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>
