<p>I have installed vim-latex. It all works perfectly, but it creates a lot of auxiliary files. I use texlive, which has the option <code>-output-directory=DIR</code> to separate temp files, but the .pdf is put in this DIR too. And, when I use <code>\lv</code> to view the pdf, vim-latex doesn't find the pdf file.</p>  <p>How can I configure \lv in vim-latex to view a pdf in a different folder from the source?</p>
