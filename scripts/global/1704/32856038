<p>I am trying to draw some graphs with reading some values from the file, using epslatex - gnuplot (version 5.0 patchlevel 1), as follows:</p>  <pre><code># gnuplot.gp set term epslatex set output "figure.tex" set xlabel "x" set ylabel "y"  set nokey set size square set xrange [0:1.0] set yrange [0:1.0]  do for[idLine = 1 : 4 : 1]{     a1 = system("cat data.dat | awk 'NR == ".idLine." {print $1}'")     a2 = system("cat data.dat | awk 'NR == ".idLine." {print $2}'")      plot x**a1 + a2 with lines lt 1 lc rgb "black" } </code></pre>  <p>and the data is</p>  <pre><code># data.dat 1.0 0.0 2.0 0.0 3.0 0.0 4.0 0.0 </code></pre>  <p>Though I could managed to draw figure I've wanted, there is still a problem that the labels are getting bolder than a single plot (please see figures below, I hope that the image quality is enough to tell the difference ...). It seems that these phenomenon occur due to the duplex letters of the several times plotting.</p>  <p>I have tried several way to avoid this problem, but non of these didn't work. Is there any smart way to avoid this problem?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8qqIN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8qqIN.png" alt="Graph with number of plots"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pWa0f.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pWa0f.png" alt="Graph with a single plot"></a></p>
