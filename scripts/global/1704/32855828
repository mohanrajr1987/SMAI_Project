<p>From within the jupyter notebook, is there a way to add latex figure caption below each inline matplotlib figure? This is desired so that each figure is annotated when running nbconvert --to latex.</p>  <p>But I am not clear on how to position the LaTeX relative to the figure which ends up in \begin{verbatim} block. I can place it in a markdown cell just after the plot; but, that does not wrap the figure as I want.</p>
