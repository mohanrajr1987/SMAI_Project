<p>I'm using ShareLatex and I'm getting a <code>! Missing $ inserted.</code> error. Saw that there are lots of posts with this topic, but the fixes they say work aren't working with my code. The only one I'm yet to try is to <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/54324/87889">tell latex to ignore the problem, and continue, instead of trying to fix it</a> to see where the problem is, but I do not know how to do this in ShareLatex.</p>  <p>Here's a list of the fixes I've tried:</p>  <ul> <li>All my accents are properly written: <code>\'a</code> <code>\~o</code></li> <li>I already escaped all my underscores <code>\_</code></li> <li>Bars <code>|</code> should be escaped, I don't have any.</li> <li><p>My equations don't have white lines (apparently this error appears with white lines in equations)</p>  <pre><code>\begin{equation}\small\label{ORR} I_k = \frac{I_{lim}\, I}{I_{lim} - I} \end{equation} </code></pre></li> </ul>  <p>I don't want to post the code because of private information, and since I don't know where the error is it's too long to edit all of it out.</p>
