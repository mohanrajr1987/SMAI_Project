<p>I am trying to use simple LaTeX Math parser using PegJS.</p>  <p>My current grammar is posted here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2a4cd07f0d0c14f10c1e" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2a4cd07f0d0c14f10c1e</a></p>  <p>I wonder why parsing <code>\abs{\abs{3}}</code> is calling abs method about <strong>18</strong> times. With bigger recursion my browser just crash.</p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>
