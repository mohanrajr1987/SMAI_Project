<p>I want to use <strong><code>psfrag</code></strong> to modify the contents of my <strong><code>.eps</code></strong> figures.</p>  <p>However, the tags generated by <code>matplotlib</code> is saved letter by letter, and doesn't seem to be recognized by <code>psfrag</code>.</p>  <p>Did a lot of googling, but couldn't find anything. Please help!</p>  <p>Cheers,  Emmanuel </p>
