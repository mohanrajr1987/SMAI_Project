<p>Basically I want the document to serve as some kind of journal, to record what I've done every day, so I need to add a date stamp in every entry. It should be like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>9/14/2015</p>      <p>added a comma to the poem.</p>      <p>9/15/2015</p>      <p>comma deleted.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I know <code>\date{\today}</code> will add the date of the last compilation, but that's not what I want, and the google results are mostly about this (might be I'm search for the wrong key word).</p>
