<p>I'm using Sphinx 1.3.1 autodoc and am searching for a way to insert a page break if the function is going to otherwise be split between pages when rendering a pdf (latex).</p>  <p>Is there an existing directive somewhere?  </p>  <p>I can modify the .tex file prior to building, inserting \begin{samepage} ... \end{samepage} in the right places, but it would be great to have these wrap a function section automatically.</p>
