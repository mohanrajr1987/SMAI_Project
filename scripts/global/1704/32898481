<p>I am using the BMC latex template and need assistance with the referencing part.</p>  <p>The reference for a journal article in the template is as follows:   </p>  <p>Smith J, Jones M Jr, Houghton L.:  Future of health insurance. N Engl J Med 965:325-329 (1999)</p>  <p>and this will be cited in-text as Smith et al. (1999) or (Smith et al., 1999).</p>  <p>However, I want the style to be of the form that conforms to the requirement for SpringerPlus journals which requires the use of BioMed Central latex template:</p>  <p>Smith J, Jones M Jr, Houghton L (1999) Future of health insurance. N Engl J Med 965:325-329  with in sample citations Smith et al. (1999) or (Smith et al. 1999) </p>  <p>How can I change the bibliographic style to reflect the latter?</p>
