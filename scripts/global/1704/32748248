<p>I have researched and found how to create a watermark in an rmarkdown document.</p>  <p>It works great on basic text, but when you have a plot heavy page, it gets hidden behind the plot.</p>  <p>Obviously, this makes it easy for someone to screencap the figures and use them outside of the PDF.</p>  <p>Below is some code that demonstrates the issue clearly.</p>  <pre><code>--- title: "Testing Watermark" author: "John" date: "September 18, 2015" header-includes:    - \usepackage{draftwatermark} output:   pdf_document ---  This is some basic text.   Note the watermark on this page, and the hidden watermark on the next page.  \newpage  \SetWatermarkText{DRAFT}  ```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=7} library(ggplot2)  ggplot(mtcars) +   geom_point(aes(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl)) +   facet_wrap(~carb, ncol=1) +    theme_bw() ``` </code></pre>  <p>If anyone is aware of a fix for this, I'd be grateful.</p>  <p>Either making the ggplot backgrounds transparent (which I've tried), or bringing the watermark to the foreground and making it transparent would be ok as far as I'm concerned.</p>
