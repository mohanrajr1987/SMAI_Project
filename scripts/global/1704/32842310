<p>I am preparing a paper for <strong>International Journal of Ad Hoc and Ubiquitous Computing</strong>. Latex template of this journal provided in <a href="http://www.inderscience.com/info/inauthors/author_templates.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.inderscience.com/info/inauthors/author_templates.php</a> (two column). However I have some problem with this: In some cases likes pictures, diagrams, tables and specially equations, my equation did not fit in its column and latex put them outside of the box borders. How can I fix it?</p>
