<p>I have used apacite package with option natbibapa for bibliography maintenance in Latex document:     \usepackage[natbibapa]{apacite}. I have switched from natbib where I have used option numbers, to get numbered references in square brackets. Now I've lost numbering. How to get it in natbibapa? To be clear as possible, I get reference:</p>  <p>Zhang, Y., Faghri, A., i Shafii, M. B. (2000). Capillary blocking in forced convective condensation in horizontal miniature channels. Journal of Heat Transfer , 123 , 501–511</p>  <p>I want:</p>  <p>[4] Zhang, Y., Faghri, A., i Shafii, M. B. (2000). Capillary blocking in forced convective condensation in horizontal miniature channels. Journal of Heat Transfer , 123 , 501–511</p>
