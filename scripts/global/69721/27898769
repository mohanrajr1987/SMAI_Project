<p>I would like to  develop a remote monitoring application for iOS devices. For this I need  to communicate with iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) from Mac machine and get the screenshot from the device as well as send keystrokes or touch events to the device.</p>  <p>For example, I need to send following to the device to get capture the screen:</p>  <pre><code>UIATarget.localTarget().captureScreenWithName("LoginScreen") </code></pre>  <p>How should I send this command to the device and receive the screenshot? I need some pointers to communicate with the devices.</p>  <p><strong>My basic requirement is</strong> - I have a iPhone application running. Now From client side (From remote machine through browser) we are controlling application. If I click on a login button then that operation should fired on on a device connected to Mac server. In this way we can fire events periodically.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
