<p>I have been working one app that includes iPhone camera and photo gallery. I have a thought of doing some functionalities for my app like cropping and rotating. I have searched in web for somethings related to Apple did.</p>  <p>But I am unable to get the proper information related to that. I am not sure whether the possibility is there or not to do something like when we select an image from gallery and click on edit button Apple directly showing image edit controls like crop brightness and rotation. If I want to implement the same in my app is it possible or I need to go for the third party controls. Here is the image to show toy you to exactly get my point how I need controls in camera.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PWJxl.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
