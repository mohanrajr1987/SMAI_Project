<p>I want to test iPhone/iPad app from remote client. I created one web application and by using browser I fires events on iPhone/iPad app. These events should get fired on connected device to Mac system. I tried this a lot by using instrument UIAutomation. But UIAutomation receives JavaScript test case file. This file has whole test case commands. But for now, I don't have multiple commands predefined. Now I need to create commands dynamically according to user UI interaction and want to fire these commands on device and send screenshot return to browser client.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated...</p>
