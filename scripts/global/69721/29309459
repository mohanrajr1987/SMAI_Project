<p>I recently uploaded a test version of my app to iTunes Connect and the next day got this email:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>We have discovered one or more issues with your recent delivery for   "MyApp". Your delivery was successful, but you may wish to correct the   following issues in your next delivery:   Missing 64-bit support -   Beginning on February 1, 2015 new iOS apps submitted to the App Store   must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK. Beginning   June 1, 2015 app updates will also need to follow the same   requirements. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the   default Xcode build setting of “Standard architectures” to build a   single binary with both 32-bit and 64-bit code.   After you’ve corrected the issues, you can use Xcode or Application Loader   to upload a new binary to iTunes Connect.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The last time I did a release I couldn't upload the app until I fixed the 64-bit build so I know that's okay, but I'm still building against the iOS 5 SDK because our app still supports it. If I change to build for the iOS 8 SDK will this stop my app working for older versions of iOS? How can I tell if new functionality will still work on iOS 5?</p>
