<p>I have one app in that if I am uploading video from existing video and share using my app it is sharing perfect but if I take video on the spot using the iphone and share it then it is not working. Sahring video is cutting if I can say it is showing in 1% part of my video player. Can any one help how I can solve it ? I am using og tags for sharing on facebook.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
