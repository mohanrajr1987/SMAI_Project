<p>I have an iOS 5 era app that I need to update to "modern" terms to be able to submit an update to the app store.  I am shooting for iOS 8 as a baseline using auto layout and size classes.</p>  <p>The base UI is a Tab Bar controller, each tab of which has a UINavigationController as its base. </p>  <p>MainWindow.xib is the main nib file used when opening the app.</p>  <p>I opened all the nibs and checked Use Autolayout and Use Size Classes.</p>  <p>The app runs, but always comes up as a 3.5" phone sized app, even on a 6 Plus (device or simulator).   I cannot find any constraints applicable nor any settings in any of the nibs that seem to affect this.</p>  <p>The Tab Bar itself seems stuck at the 3.5" size and I can find no constraints or settings on this.  The window and tab bar element themselves in the nib show the generic 600x600 / any-any size.</p>
