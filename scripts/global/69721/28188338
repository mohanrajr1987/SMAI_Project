<p>What is the best size for graphics for deep-linking notifications linking back from one's app to a different app (particularly Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, iMessage, and/or WhatsApp) on iOS 5? Should they be square or horizontal, or does it make a difference? And do they need to go back to the server first? I've found sources on how to deeplink using certain apps (e.g. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios</a> and <a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.pinterest.com/</a>), but am having trouble finding the information I'm asking about. I would really appreciate any help anyone can offer regarding this!</p>
