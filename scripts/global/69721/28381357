<p>I am trying to build a simple <code>TableView</code> having a search bar using Xamarin. On my simulator all works fine, but when I deploy to the iPad 1 (iOS 5.1.1) I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>wrapper type "UIKit.SearchController" is missing its native objective c class </code></pre>  <p>It seems that iOS 5.1.1 doesn't have the <code>UISearchController</code>. I actually had the same issue with the <code>RegisterClassForCellReuse</code>, which works fine on simulator but NOT on the device...</p>  <p>My question is: how can I make sure which API's are actually existing for my target iOS version and which are not, so I don't have to debug all API calls independently????</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!<br> N.</p>
