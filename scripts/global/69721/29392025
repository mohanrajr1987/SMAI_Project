<p>When I launch my app using Xcode 6.2 on an iPad 1 running iOS 5.1.1, I get the following error:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/43l1S.png" alt="Unsupported Run Configuration: Xcode cannot install or launch applications supporting the 64-bit architecture on devices running iOS version prior to 6.0"></p>  <p>I couldn't find any documentation on how to exclude this architecture. Any ideas? My app's deployment target is set to 5.1.1.</p>
