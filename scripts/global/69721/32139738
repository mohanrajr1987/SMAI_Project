<p>I need to support the following business scenario for managing updates: </p>  <p>App xxx.app(Version 6.1) is in the AppStore, it supports iOS 3 to 6.3.<br/> We developed a new version xxx.app(Version 6.2) which supports iOS 7 and above.</p>  <p>My question is, would it be possible to distribute an update for users of iOS 3 to 6.3, and another update for users of iOS 7 and above.  (i.e something like two versions of one app)</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
