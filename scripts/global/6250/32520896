<p>I am working in Qlikview on a database with a lot of dates. I need to convert a date to a decimal value so I can calculate a % of total travel time in a particular month (eg 3 /30 days = 10%). However when I do a <code>CONVERT(DECIMAL(20,10),YY.Transit_Days)</code> it states that it failed to connect to ODBC. When I remove <code>CONVERT</code>, everything works fine, but i/o 3 days it shows a date in 1900. Note: I am working on a read-only database (don't know if that has any effect).</p>
