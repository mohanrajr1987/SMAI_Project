<p>I'm currently working on a sketch that will send data to 3 TLC5971 LED drivers. I need to accept a brightness level in the form <code>uint16_t</code> and then convert that value into two 8-bit hex numbers to pass to the LED drivers.</p>  <p>Example <code>65535</code> --> <code>0xFF</code> and <code>0xFF</code></p>  <p>Is there any relatively easy way to do this? I've found several methods that return arrays of characters and whatnot but they don't seem to be easy to implement.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any experience doing anything similar?</p>
