<p>I'm trying to find out why the %.2f declaration when outputting a decimal isn't working in my code, I've check other questions similar but I cant seem to locate the issue in the specific logic error I'm receiving. When I go to compile my program it compiles fine, I go to run it and everything outputs fine till I  get to the final cost where I'm trying to only display that decimal value with 2 decimal places. </p>  <p>I get an exception in thread "main"      </p>  <pre><code>Java.util.illegalformatconversionexception  f! = Java.lang.string At java.util.Formatter$formatspecifier.failconversion(Unknown Source) At java.util.Formatter$formatspecifier.printFloat(Unknown Source) At java.util.Formatter.format(Unknown Source) At java.io.printstream.format(Unknown Source) At java.io.printstream.printf(Unknown Source) At Cars.main(Cars.java:27) </code></pre>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <p>import java.util.Scanner;   public class Cars   {</p>  <pre><code>  public static void main(String [] args)   {     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);      int carYear, currentYear, carAge;      double costOfCar, salesTaxRate;     double totalCost;      String carModel;     System.out.println("Please enter your favorite car model.");         carModel = input.nextLine();     System.out.println("Please enter the  year of the car");         carYear = input.nextInt();     System.out.println("Please enter the current year.");         currentYear = input.nextInt();         carAge = currentYear - carYear;     System.out.println("How much does the car cost?");         costOfCar = input.nextDouble();     System.out.println("What is the sales tax rate?");         salesTaxRate = input.nextDouble();         totalCost = (costOfCar + (costOfCar * salesTaxRate));     System.out.printf("The model of your favorite car is" + carModel + ", the car is" + " " + carAge + " " + " years old, the total of the car is" + " " + "%.2f",totalCost + " " + " dollars.");      } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>Like I said before I'm not exactly what's causing the issue but any hints would be great on what I'm overlooking. </p>
