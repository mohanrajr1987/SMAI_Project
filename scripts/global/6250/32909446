<p>I have declared the below Variables:</p>  <pre><code>NSDecimalNumber *gross_total = 0; NSDecimalNumber *net_total = 0; int *checks = 0; NSString *current_check; </code></pre>  <p>I have trying to Loop through each JSONElement to add all of the Values together to receive a Total which I have called 'gross_total'</p>  <pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; TransactionArray.count; i++) {     NSDictionary *jsonElement = TransactionArray[i];     NSDecimalNumber *gross = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:jsonElement[@"tran_value"]];      gross_total = [gross_total decimalNumberByAdding:gross];       // Accumulate if this is part of the previous check or a new one, add to INT Value for Check Count.      if (jsonElement[@"tran_check"] == current_check){      // DO NOTHING     }     else{         //ADD TO THE CHECK COUNT         checks++;      }     current_check = jsonElement[@"tran_check"]; } </code></pre>  <p>Using the Breakpoints, I have discovered that the 'gross' gets a value from the 1st JSONElement of 3.4 which is great, however when it tried to use the decimalNumberByAdding function to accumulate 'gross_total' the value is NOT Passed to 'gross_total'.</p>  <p>I cant see what I am doing wrong, and would love some help ?</p>
