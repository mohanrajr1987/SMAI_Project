<p>I have two issues with the submit formsubmitreply script I am working on and I can't seem to get it to work no matter what I do. </p>  <p>The first issue is when you enter a time in the form, it loads into the spreadsheet in the correct format but then when it is entered into the confirmation email it becomes GMT +0. I can not for the life of me figure out why or how. </p>  <p>The oldest ticket (not assigned to someone) is dated: 9/19/2015 at 05:00 PM</p>  <p>The second issue in the same script is I can not get rid of the decimal points in the email. </p>  <p>It is having the same exact issue as above where it is corrected perfectly in the spreadsheet but when it is put into the email it reverts to what it says below:  We are approximately 123.03481555567123 hours out.</p>  <p>Here is some snippets of script from the date issue </p>  <pre><code>var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();   var lastRow = sheet.getLastRow(); var ufdateFQ = sheet.getRange(lastRow, getColIndexByName("Oldest Ticket")).getValue(); var dateFQ = Utilities.formatDate(ufdateFQ, "GMT -5", "M/dd/yyyy' at 'hh:mm a"); </code></pre>  <p>And then I add it to the variable like this: </p>  <pre><code>var emailBody = "ticket (not assigned to someone) is dated: &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=#cc0000&gt;"+ dateFQ; </code></pre>  <p>and I have it in the mail app </p>  <pre><code>htmlBody: emailBody, </code></pre>  <p>Then here are some snippets of code from the hours out. Column A is the time stamp and column I is the date they input on the form. </p>  <pre><code>  sheet.getRange(lastRow, getColIndexByName("Days Out")).setValue("=(A:A-I:I)*24");    sheet.getRange(lastRow, getColIndexByName("Days Out")).setNumberFormat('@STRING@');   sheet.getRange(lastRow, getColIndexByName("Days Out")).setNumberFormat("0");   var hoF = sheet.getRange(lastRow, getColIndexByName("Days Out")).getValue(); </code></pre>  <p>I add it to the email same as I did above. </p>  <p>Thank you for your help!  -Marc</p>
