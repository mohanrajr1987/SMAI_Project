<p>I have the int <code>15</code> (or the string <code>"15"</code>, that's just as easy), and I need to use it to create the value:</p>  <pre><code>"\u0015" </code></pre>  <p>Is there some conversion which would accomplish this?  I can't do this:</p>  <pre><code>"\u00" + myInt.ToString() </code></pre>  <p>Because the first literal is invalid.  Is there a simple way to get this result?</p>  <p>(If you're curious, this is for integrating with a hardware device where the vendor sometimes expresses integer values as hexadecimal.  For example, I'd need to send today's date to the device as <code>"\u0015\u0010\u0002"</code>.)</p>
