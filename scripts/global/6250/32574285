<p>I have scoured the internet and I haven't found a solution that really works for me, yet.</p>  <pre><code>var tv = Length * Type;  if (tv &lt; 0)      {     cForm.voltage.value = "-" + Math.abs(tv) + " V";     } else... </code></pre>  <p>Some of the calculations with these two numbers come out to about the 15th decimal for some reason. I would like to limit the decimal amount that is returned, and NOT allow the number to round up or down. On a calculator it only comes out to about the third decimal, but <code>Math.abs()</code> brings it too far out.</p>  <p><code>.toFixed()</code> Doesn't work for me because if the number only has 2 decimals it will add additional zeros at the end. I only want to display up to the fourth if it is calculated.</p>
