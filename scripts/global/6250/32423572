<p>I've got a question to which I need someone to help me verify to see if my answer is correct or not. </p>  <p>Showing all steps involved, convert the unsigned decimal number 28.2 to: Hexadecimal, using 1 digit for the integer part and 2 for the fractional part.</p>  <p>I come up with the answer C1.33, but since I am only allowed 1 digit for the integer part I would assume I would remove the 1?</p>
