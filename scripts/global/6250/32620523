<p>In SQL Server 2008 I am trying to get results to truncate to a specific number of decimal places depending on the value of the field.  The trouble I am running into is if the last decimal place is going to be zero then it doesn't display it.  My code is as follows:</p>  <p><code>case when @field &gt;= 250 then round(@field,1,1)      when @field between 100 and 249.9999 then round(@field,2,1)      when @field &lt; 100 then round(@field,3,2) end</code></p>  <p>It works great by changing <code>250.36745</code> into <code>250.3</code>, but <code>250.04567</code> returns <code>250</code> and I need it to be <code>250.0</code></p>
