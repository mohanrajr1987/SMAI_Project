<p>I have this line that works and gets my column into a number</p>  <pre><code>       case when Auth_Amt  LIKE '%DAY%'  then cast(SUBSTRING(Auth_Amt FROM 1 FOR POSITION('/DAY' IN Auth_Amt) - 1) as numeric) when Auth_Amt  LIKE '%TAX%'  then cast(SUBSTRING(Auth_Amt FROM 1 FOR POSITION(' ' IN Auth_Amt) - 1) as numeric)             when Auth_Amt  LIKE '%SCHG%'  then cast(SUBSTRING(Auth_Amt FROM 1 FOR POSITION(' ' IN Auth_Amt) - 1) as numeric)             else 0        end as Amt_Day </code></pre>  <p>what can I add to this to make it come back with two decimal spots also. Right now it is whole numbers bring back.</p>
