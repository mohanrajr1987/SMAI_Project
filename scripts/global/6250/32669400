<p>I've found some other topics on this but I couldn't get it to work. Please remember this is my 1st day learning Python.</p>  <pre><code>Berekening1 = 8.5 Berekening2 = 8.1+4.8 Berekening3 = 8*10 Berekening4 = 3 x = Berekening1 * Berekening2 * Berekening3 + Berekening4 print "Het antwoord van de berekening is:", round(x); print x, print "." </code></pre>  <p>I want x to be an integer. How do I do that? I tried both int and round.</p>  <p>Anyone also have an idea on how to remove the "space" between "x" and "." at the ending when code is executed?</p>
