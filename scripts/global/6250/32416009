<p>I'm sure this question has been answered before, but sometimes I need to ask it in my own words to understand the answer.</p>  <p>I ran into an issue recently where a person with Czech language being used on their computer would could not run my application, I use US-English.</p>  <p>I have some decimal values saved as a string in an SQLite database. I guess the Czech language does not like my decimals(1.50) because it crashes when trying to parse it from string to decimal. It just doesn't recognize 1.50 as the correct format for a decimal.</p>  <p>I'm hoping for an easy fix, someone suggested forcing Localization Culture to en-US. I did a little research and got really confused, I was hoping someone could help me understand how to solve this issue.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>  <p>Loading the SQLite data:</p>  <pre><code>    Public Shared Sub LoadAutoBetting()     Dim SQLstr As String = "Select * FROM AutoBetting"     Dim connection As String = "Data Source=utb.db;Version=3"     Dim SQLConn As New SQLiteConnection     Dim SQLcmd As New SQLiteCommand     Dim SQLdr As SQLiteDataReader     SQLConn.ConnectionString = connection     SQLConn.Open()     SQLcmd.Connection = SQLConn     SQLcmd.CommandText = SQLstr     SQLdr = SQLcmd.ExecuteReader()     While SQLdr.Read()         Bets.autoMulti = SQLdr(0)     End While     SQLdr.Close()     SQLConn.Close() End Sub </code></pre>  <p>The error pops at <code>Bets.autoMulti = SQLdr(0)</code> autoMulti is a decimal, SQLdr(0) is a string(1.50) which is a default value that I inserted when I created the table.</p>
