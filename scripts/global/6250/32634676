<p>I need to be able to store a signed decimal value (no larger than -200 to +200) into an unsigned char[4].</p>  <p>At first I was thinking of using </p>  <pre><code>union {  float f;  unsigned char u[4]; } </code></pre>  <p>as float is also 4bytes.</p>  <p>but the binary value it generates doesnt match its value (i.e 7 doesnt shows 0111).  &lt;&lt; I was so wrong on hoping that floating point would work. </p>  <p>I'm thinking of using double and only store the LSB 4 bytes into the unsigned char by using bitwise operations. </p>  <p>Is there any "best solution" out there for my problem? Please provide a hint somewhere so that I can look into it! thanks!</p>
