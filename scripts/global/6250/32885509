<p>I have imported a CSV file where a specific column has a decimal number.</p>  <p>In the original excel file (before saving it to a CSV), the first number of the column shows up as 218,790. When I choose the cell, the number shows up as 218790.243077911. </p>  <p>In the CSV file the number shows up as 218790 and when I choose the cell it is 218,790. </p>  <p>When I import the file on mySQL and show the table I created, the number shows up as 218.000000000.</p>  <p>Here is the code I used:</p>  <pre><code>create table Apolo_Test( Leads decimal (15,9) );  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/Users/SCRIPTS/file.csv' INTO TABLE Apolo_Test FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 7 ROWS ; </code></pre>  <p>I tried updating the format with this :</p>  <pre><code>update Apolo_Test set Leads = format(Leads, 10, 'de_DE'); </code></pre>  <p>but it did not work. I have never had a case where files had a comma before. I guess it is the UK version of numerical fields.</p>  <p>How is it possible to make it work on mySQL without using any MACROS in excel?</p>  <p>UPD: It works but I get some warnings although I double checked the csv file and the fields :</p>  <pre><code>create table Apolo_Test( Ad_Group varchar(50), Impacts int, Leads decimal (10,3) );  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/Users/apolo.siskos/Desktop/SCRIPTS/11/Adalyser.csv' INTO TABLE Apolo_Test FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 7 ROWS (Ad_Group, Impacts, @Leads) SET Leads = replace(@Leads, ',', ''); ;  alter table Apolo_Test ADD IPL decimal (10,6) after Leads; update Apolo_Test set IPL=Impacts/Leads; select * from Apolo_Test; </code></pre>
