<p>I understand the memory storage requirements for the MySQL decimal number (eg. DECIMAL(5,2) requires 2 bytes for the 3 integers and 1 for the decimals. But I notice that decimal can also be signed or unsigned.</p>  <p>With numbers such as TINYINT, the range varies depending on whether it is signed (-128 to 127) or unsigned (0-255). My question then is does the memory usage for decimals change if they are signed or unsigned? Would -999.99 to 999.99 use the same memory as 000.00 to 999.99?</p>
