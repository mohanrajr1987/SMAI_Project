<p>I have modified some code in MatLab so that it will give me the root of the function cos(x) - 3*x. When I run the code and ask for it to return the value of xnew (as xnew should equal the root of the function) it returns xnew to only 4 decimal points. I would like for it to be more than this. Does anyone know why it capping this value? </p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>x = 0; N = 100000; Tol = 0.00001; count = 1; while count &lt;= N f = cos(x) - 3*x; Df = -sin(x) - 3; d = (f/Df); xnew = x - (d); if (abs(xnew - x)) &lt; Tol break end x = xnew; count = count + 1; end</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
