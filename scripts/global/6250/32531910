<p>I thought I could accomplish this easily with something such as the following:</p>  <pre><code>double numInput;  numInput = Double.parseDouble(inputTxtField.getText());  if ((numInput * 100) % 1 != 0) {  // do something  } </code></pre>  <p>However, I'm getting all sorts of strange test cases where such as:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>false:   2.11,   2.5,   2.6</p>      <p>true:   2.22, 2.3, 2.2</p> </blockquote>  <p>I just started programming so maybe this is a silly goof, but I thought multiplying a double by 100 and then checking for a remainder when dividing by 1 would work. The intent is to prevent someone from entering a number with more than two decimals. Less than or equal to 2 decimals is fine.</p>  <p>Any tips are appreciated! Thank you!</p>  <p>EDIT: Thank you for all the quick comments! This solved my problem, and I really appreciate the extra information as to why it won't work. Thank you!</p>
