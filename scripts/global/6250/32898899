<p>I need to write a program for school in which I read a file, the file contains hex errors. Then I grab the error and convert it from hex to binary then to decimal WITHOUT using any defined java methods such parseInt. </p>  <p>The file data is of type string so I put them in an arraylist of type string, how can I grab each element in the array and convert it to a decimal number of type int and then display the errors in decimal form???</p>
