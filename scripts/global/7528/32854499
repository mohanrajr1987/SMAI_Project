<p>I have a database for salaries of employees.<br/></p>  <p>Here are the <code>Salaries</code> Table fields:</p>  <pre><code>emp_no INT(11) salary INT(11) from_date DATE to_date DATE </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to get the top 10 employee salaries, non-duplicate employees. With the code below I can get the maximum salary for the emp_no, but my from_date and to_date are defaulting to the earliest date values for that emp_no.</p>  <pre><code>select emp_no, max(salary) as salary, from_date, to_date from salaries group by emp_no order by salary DESC limit 10 </code></pre>  <p>I assumed <code>GROUP BY</code> would keep the values of the dates that matched up with the salary and <code>emp_no</code>, but after thinking about it a bit it doesn't make sense for it to do so. </p>  <p>Any help with how to get the correct date values would be very much appreciated.</p>
