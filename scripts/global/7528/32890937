<p>I'm using UniServerZ to run my PHP and have setup a database in PHPMyAdmin. Here is the PHP to connect to the database.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php     $db = mysqli_connect('localhost','root','','easyfix');     if(mysqli_connect_errno()){        echo "Failed to connect to MYSQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();     } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However this gives the error in the title. </p>  <p>I've read other possible solutions on this but none seem to work. The database / user account is using default settings ~ I've changed nothing. What would be causing this error?</p>
