<p>I've encountered a bit of a situation with creating my sql database.  I've been working on a Questionnaire that has tons of questions.  I'm using a PHP script that automatically creates the table when a user submits the questionnaire and it uses the input names to name the columns of the table.</p>  <p>I figured a good way to keep everything easy for me to follow later on when I review submissions is to use the questions as the name attribute for the HTML inputs so that when I query it everything is right there and I don't have to wonder which answer goes to which question or go back and forth looking at something else. </p>  <p>The problem I ran into is there's a limit to how long the names of SQL columns can be.  I'm not sure of exactly how long that is but I ran into an error until I shortened the input names.</p>  <p>So what I need to accomplish is using shorter names for the inputs so they're not too long for the sql columns, but somehow link it to another table that consists of the actual names so they can be queried later on when I need to go over a submission.  Is there a workaround for this?</p>
