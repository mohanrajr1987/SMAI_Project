<p>After following all the steps to setup the development environment, everything is working: PHP,MYSQL.</p>  <p>When, I enter the <code>localhost/myusername/</code> the PHPmyadmin login page does not show up.</p>  <p>Did you miss this symbol <code>~</code> in front of your username?</p>  <p>The solution is to enter <code>localhost/~yourusername/</code>.</p>  <p>That is how I did it. Thanks</p>
