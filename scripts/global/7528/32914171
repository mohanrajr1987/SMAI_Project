<p>I am new to Google Cloud and i want to set up an Instance Template and then create an Instance Group using the template.</p>  <p>After creating the group, i want to enable "Network Load Balancing".</p>  <p>During Template creation, it asks for startup scripts. I checked online and found the following script.</p>  <pre><code>#! /bin/bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y apache2 </code></pre>  <p>I want to use Apache, PHP and MySql (with PHPMyAdmin) on the cloud. So i added some more scripts in it. The script i created is this:</p>  <pre><code>#! /bin/bash sudo apt-get install -y apache2 sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server sudo apt-get install -y phpmyadmin </code></pre>  <p>But when i create an Instance Group, there is no access to PhpMyAdmin and not even the IP Address shows server not found.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me setup Google Cloud?</p>
