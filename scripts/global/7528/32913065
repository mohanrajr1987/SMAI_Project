<p>When logging into phpMyAdmin, I see the following message at the bottom of the main panel : </p>  <p>The phpMyAdmin configuration storage is not completely configured, some extended features have been deactivated. Find out why.       Or alternately go to 'Operations' tab of any database to set it up there.</p>  <p>I understand this is about activating special features in phpMyAdmin, by editing the config file and creating a special database and user. However, any attempt to do so has been futile. It appears that the 'favorite' and 'central columns' tables have been deactivated. </p>  <p>Can anyone guide me through ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
