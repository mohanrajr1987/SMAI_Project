<p>I have reviewed the various questions on this topic but am still having trouble. I can connect to an AWS RDS instance from my local machine using MySQL Workbench. I can also connect to the same AWS RDS instance from an ssh session on the EC2 instance. I cannot connect using phpMyAdmin from mi EC2 instance. The /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.pnp file is attached as is the resulting screen shot when I access phpmyadmin from the EC2 instance (<a href="http://nn.nn.nnn.nn/phpmyadmin" rel="nofollow">http://nn.nn.nnn.nn/phpmyadmin</a>).</p>  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is a bit crazy but I am not allowed to upload images of the information required to substantiate the question. What is the alternative?</p>
