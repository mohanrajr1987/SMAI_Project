<p>When trying to create a new user in phpMyAdmin 4.5.0 on a MariaDB database I get a "1065 - Query was empty" error above the printed query and "The selected user was not found in the privilege table." right on top of the user creation wizard.</p>  <p>Also when I try to edit the query inline, the highlighting complains about an unrecognized statement type "WITH".</p>  <p>The full query as created by phpMyAdmin looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE USER 'asd'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '***';GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'asd'@'%' REQUIRE NONE WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0; </code></pre>  <p>The syntax highlighting complains about the with in "WITH mysql_native_password" and about the word "USAGE" in the GRANT statement. I don't really know why phpMyAdmin explicitly names the authentication plugin/mechanism when it's using the default and only installed MySQL native password.</p>  <p>When I remove the "WITH mysql_native_password" part from the query it executes just fine. (Obviously I entered the password which was removed/replaced with asterisks by phpMyAdmin in that query again)</p>  <p>So is this authentication plugin stuff a setting I can change somewhere or is this a bug in phpMyAdmin with MariaDB backend?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
