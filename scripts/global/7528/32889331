<p>I'm totally new to both vagrant and linux command line. I've configured vagrant through the PHPStorm plugin using the Vagrant config file.</p>  <p>I've got nginx, mysql and php all running smoothly. However, I'm having some issues installing phpmyadmin;</p>  <p>The following command works, and places phpmyadmin in /usr/shared/phpmyadmin</p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin </code></pre>  <p>However, I can't access this from my browser. So, I tried to move it to my nginx document root -;</p>  <pre><code>sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www </code></pre>  <p>However, upon trying this, I receive the following error;</p>  <pre><code>ln: failed to create symbolic link 'var/www/phpmyadmin': Protocol Error </code></pre>  <p>I've tried as both <em>root</em> user and as <em>vagrant</em> user. No success.</p>  <p>Any ideas? I can access my site perfectly fine using <strong><a href="http://localhost:8913/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8913/</a></strong> but I just can't access phpmyadmin.</p>  <p>It's gotten to the point that I just tried to import my database through the mysql cl interface but had errors with that too!</p>
