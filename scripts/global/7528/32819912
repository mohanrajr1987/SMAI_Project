<p>I have a small website I'm working on and for this project I want to use phpMyAdmin's user interface to edit items directly in the database instead of building an admin user interface for the website. I'm going to quick edit items like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://forumbilder.se/ECJ29/capture2.png" alt="a busy cat"></p>  <p>(Not actually using wordpress, just took a random database table to use as an example)</p>  <p>The problem is that I have a column holding the datetime for when the row was last edited, and I don't know how to  make said column update itself automatically after an edit like this is made. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
