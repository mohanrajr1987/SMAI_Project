<p>Oracle 7 Nginx PHP5.5</p>  <p>I am currently getting only a blank page when trying to access phpMyAdmin instance. I've already took look at the page source and there is HTML content but for whatever reason, the page remains blank. Is this a bug? Has anyone experienced this particular issue like this before?</p>  <p><a href="http://pastebin.com/bDQ2p52b" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/bDQ2p52b</a></p>
