<p>Currently I have a composite-primary key consisting of (user, id). My user is John Smith and there are say 30 rows that pertain to him, hence id auto increments each time a new entry is made.   However, if i wanted to add a new user, say Jill Smith to the same table, is there a way in which I can start at (Jill Smith, 1) and have the id auto increment without messing up the previous entries? </p>
