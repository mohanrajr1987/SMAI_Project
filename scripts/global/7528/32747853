<p>I have an sql database which earlier I connected to no problem using this code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $con=mysql_connect("localhost","user192","xxxx") or die ("couldnt connect to sql");  $db=mysql_select_db ("sound-library",$con) or die ("cant find database"); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The strange this is that I tried renaming the database to something else in phpmyadmin and updating the name in the msql_select_db line but it didn't work. Because it didn't work I tried renaming it back to sound-library and again updating the msql_select_db line (ie so that it was like I had it before renaming) and now it says I get the cant find database message. This makes no sense as im reverting back to exactly what I had before and its not finding the db! Is there something that could have happened in renaming it in phpmyadmin that is not visible in the db names that are shown on the left?</p>
