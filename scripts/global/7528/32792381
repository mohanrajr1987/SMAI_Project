<p>A simple SQL statement such as</p>  <pre><code>SELECT 1 from MyTable WHERE 1 NOT IN (2); </code></pre>  <p>generates:</p>  <pre><code>4 Errors were found during analysis.      1. Unrecognized keyword (near "NOT IN" at position 30)     2. Unexpected token. (near "(" at position 37)     3. Unexpected token. (near "2" at position 38)     4. Unexpected token. (near ")" at position 39) </code></pre>  <p>I just noticed on the phpMYAdmin website "Current version compatible with PHP 5.5 to 7.0 and MySQL 5.5".  The version of MySql I am using is 5.6.26. Could this be the problem?  The above SQL certain des not cause a problem when entered directly via mysql.exe (MySql Console).</p>
