<p>In the old version, I had more control over how I would backup my table and data.</p>  <p>After selecting the database and table, I would click on the Export tab, and at the bottom was a "Save as file" checkbox.  From there I would get the Microsoft Windows Explorer "Save As" dialog box and had more control where to save my .sql files.</p>  <p>This latest version of phpmyadmin no longer gives me that option.  I am given the options "Quick" and Custom."  Choosing Custom gives me the option to "Save output to a file", lets me specify a "File name template" which is set to @TABLE@ and the character set.  It does not give me the option to choose the save location.</p>  <p>When I click "Go", it opens up the output in my editpad light but through the browser's default downloads folder, and it is frustrating to have to either copy and paste the text in a new file or navigate through a series of folders every time.</p>  <p>I am using Version: 4.2.5, latest stable version: 4.5.0.2 and latest version of Google Chrome.</p>
