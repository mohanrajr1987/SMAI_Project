<p>Good day! I'm being curious on how can I backup the database automatically and send to online phpmyadmin or send the databasefile to prefer email. We are developing our System using Intranet where we use CentOS as our server provider of Mysql &amp; Phpmyadmin. I'm just thinking what if the server fail and the datas stored there are corrupted. That's worst case scenario for one system working on one place. :( Our System is made from C# Windows Form. </p>  <p>I need some ideas(or link if needed) to make some backup automatically that will be save whether in online Phpmyadmin or send the database file to my prefer email.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
