<p>So I've got a table with ~700,000 rows in it at the moment. This table takes up about 60MB. When using PHPMyAdmin to browse this table, the first few dozen sets of 30 will load just fine, taking &lt;0.001 seconds to load. However, the further I get into it, say page 17,000, the more time the pages take to load. The load times for a set of 30 rows end up taking 0.6-1.3 seconds or more. This is affecting queries drastically and I'm not sure what the issue could be. I don't feel like the table is too large or that the column structure would slow anything down. Here is an example of the column structure:</p>  <p><a href="http://puu.sh/knn8n/56acaa59fb.png" rel="nofollow">http://puu.sh/knn8n/56acaa59fb.png</a></p>  <p>The storage engine for the table is InnoDB. Any help at starting to fix this problem would be greatly appreciated, because honestly I'm clueless and feel like I've followed all the standards I've been exposed to.</p>
