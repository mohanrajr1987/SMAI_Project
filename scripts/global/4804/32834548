<p>I'm trying to figure out how to escape a single quote for a query of a Usergrid collection.  I can't find anything about it in the documentation or online.  For example I have a Book collection and I want to select those with the title "Charolette's Web"</p>  <pre><code>/books/?ql=select*where title = 'Charlotte\'s Web' </code></pre>  <p>This query does not give back any results from the database query.  I also tried '' as the escape character (like sql) but that didn't work either.</p>
