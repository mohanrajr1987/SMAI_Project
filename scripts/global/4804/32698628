<p>There is an old question from 2011 but with a wrong answer.</p>  <p>Maybe now someone can give a better answer. The question was: How can we replace the backslashes with forward slashes from this variable-link: </p>  <pre><code>$str = "http://www.domain.com/data/images\flags/en.gif"; </code></pre>  <p>The wrong answer was that:</p>  <pre><code>echo $str = str_replace('\\', '/', $str); </code></pre>  <p>And it was wrong because the result of that code changes the content of the link. (<code>http://www.domain.com/data/imageslags/en.gif</code>) It finds not only the backslash but the letter f after that and it deletes them because <code>\f</code> means "<code>formfeed (hex 0C)</code>". So how can we avoid this wrong replacement?   </p>  <p><a href="http://rextester.com/ZXFT9116" rel="nofollow">The Code is here</a> </p>
