<p>I have a jQuery function that takes a hex parameter. The hex parameter being passed looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>\x73\x70\x65\x63\x74\x61\x74\x6f\x72\x20 </code></pre>  <p>I am able to display this as it is displayed above when using HTML. After passing it to the jQuery function, I attempt to display it like so:</p>  <pre><code>$('#divid').text("This should be hex: '" + HEXparam + "' That should have been hex.'"); </code></pre>  <p>However, instead of displaying the HEX, it displays the ASCII/English translation (in the above case, the word "spectator" is displayed). Is there any way to prevent this?</p>
