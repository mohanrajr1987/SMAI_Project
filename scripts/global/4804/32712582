<p>I am building an automation suite using Xcode 7 with swift. </p>  <p>My app loads with the following Alert View:</p>  <p>Allow "Light Alarm" to access your location while you use the app?</p>  <p>When I record with UI Testing and click this alert I get the following code: app.alerts["Allow \U201cLight Alarm\U201c to access your location while you use the app?"]</p>  <p>Note: The quotes has been replaced with \U201c</p>  <p>However, when I try and compile I get the following error: "Invalid escape sequence in literal"</p>  <p>Anyone know how to get round this?</p>
