<p>I am trying to use a string with the Prime symbol in it, but I am having some issues with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/baketfxw(v=vs.110).aspx">String.StartsWith</a> method.  Why is the following code throwing the exception?</p>  <pre><code>string text_1 = @"123456"; string text_2 = @"Ê¹ABCDEF";  string fullText = text_1 + text_2; if (!fullText.StartsWith(text_1)) {     throw new Exception("Unexplained bad error."); } </code></pre>  <p>I suspect that the issue is because this Prime symbol (char)697 is being treated as an accent and so is changing the letter before it.  (I don't think it should be - it should be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)">the prime symbol</a> and so should not be changing the numerical numbers in front of it).  I am not exactly sure how to go about testing this.  I did try the method proposed in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9349632/340045">this answer</a> but it returned false:</p>  <pre><code>IsLetterWithDiacritics(text_1[5]) //  == False IsLetterWithDiacritics(fullText[5]) // == False IsLetterWithDiacritics(fullText[6]) // == False </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
