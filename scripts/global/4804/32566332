<p>I have searched and experimented, but I have not come up with a solution to this yet:  I used <code>xmodmap</code> to switch my <kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> keys for ease of use with Vim.  In my <strong>xinitrc</strong> file it has:</p>  <pre><code>if [ -s ~/.Xmodmap ]; then     xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap fi </code></pre>  <p>My <strong>~/.Xmodmap</strong> has</p>  <pre><code>... keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock ... keycode 66 = Escape Nosymbol Escape ... </code></pre>  <p>Now if I hit <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>, I actually have to hit it twice, because, though it acts as the <kbd>Esc</kbd> button, it also acts as the <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>. So the second time I hit it is to shut <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>off, but it has the same effect as hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> twice... Kind of ridiculous.  <kbd>Esc</kbd> works as <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> only.  Not sure what I am doing wrong, and Google seems to be stumped as well.</p>
