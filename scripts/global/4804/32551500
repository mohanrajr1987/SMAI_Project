<p>I'm trying to use echo in bash inside of quotes. When I try from a command line, it works fine.</p>  <p>For example: <code>echo "I'm testing the apostrophe functionality."</code> yields <code>I'm testing the apostrophe functionality.</code></p>  <p>Yet, when I write this in a script, it doesn't seem to work.</p>  <p>Here's a snippet of my code: (I'm trying to integrate ASCII art into my program)</p>  <pre><code>if [ "$2" == "-s" ]    then echo "   ___                           __ _             _            "   echo "  / _ \__ _ _ __ ___   ___      / _\ |_ __ _ _ __| |_ ___ _ __ "   echo " / /_\/ _` | '_ ` _ \ / _ \_____\ \| __/ _` | '__| __/ _ \ '__|"   echo "/ /_\\ (_| | | | | | |  __/_____|\ \ || (_| | |  | ||  __/ |   "   echo "\____/\__,_|_| |_| |_|\___|     \__/\__\__,_|_|   \__\___|_|   "   echo ""                                                                 echo "Hello!
