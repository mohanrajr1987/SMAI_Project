<p>First, thanks for all other answers on questions I never asked but you did answer. Very helpful. Unfortunately I need you help once more:</p>  <p>I have a list of files on my filesystem which I'd like to chmod to 664 via python.</p>  <p>On of the filenames/dirpaths (I am not allowed to change the filename nor dirpaths!!!) is:</p>  <p>/home/media/Music/Ke$ha/song.mp3 (NOTE $ is a literal, not a variable!)</p>  <p>I receive the files in a list: ['/some/path/file1', '/some/otherpath/file2', etc...]</p>  <p>If I try to run the following code:</p>  <p>files = ['/home/media/Music/Ke$ha/song.mp3']</p>  <p>for file in files:     os.chmod(file, 0664)</p>  <p>It complains that it cannot find /home/media/Music/Ke$ha/song.mp3. Most likely (I guess) because the called shell tries to expand $ha, which is obviously wrong.</p>  <p>The 'Ke$ha' file is just an example, there are many more files with escape characters in it (e.g. /home/media/Music/Hill's fire/song.mp3)</p>  <p>The question I have is: How can I elegantly convince python and/or the shell to handle these files properly?</p>  <p>Kind regards,</p>  <p>Robert Nagtegaal.</p>
