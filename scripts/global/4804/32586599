<p>Using Spring MVC with JSP:</p>  <p>After some reading, I came to the conclusion, that if I print some value using </p>  <p><code>${someValue}</code> </p>  <p>no html escaping is done. This is a problem since I want to print texts containing <code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code> etc.</p>  <p>The solution I am going to use is to replace all occurencies of this kind using the <code>&lt;c:out&gt;</code>-tag like </p>  <p><code>&lt;c:out value="${someValue}" /&gt;</code></p>  <p>My question is: Why would I want to use the short form in the first place? </p>  <p>The only valid usage I'd imagine would be, if I want to render the content of <strong>someValue</strong> as html (which in my opinion is rather the exceptional case).</p>  <p><strong>EDIT: I've found another post which answers my question about when to use the short form, it can be found here</strong> </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2658922/xss-prevention-in-jsp-servlet-web-application">XSS prevention in JSP/Servlet web application</a></p>  <p>As stated in the link, it is important to wrap <strong>user-controlled input which is being re-displayed</strong> since this is the potential source for an attack.</p>  <p>So, if some value does not have any special characters e.g. like <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> and is not a value generated or controlled by the user, the shorthand form <code>${someValue}</code> can be used.</p>
