<p>I am parsing some delimiter separated values, where <code>?</code> is specified as the escape character in case the delimiter appears as part of one of the values.</p>  <p>For instance: if <code>:</code> is the delimiter, and a certain field the value <code>19:30</code>, this needs to be written as <code>19?:30</code>.</p>  <p>Currently, I use <code>string[] values = input.Split(':');</code> in order to get an array of all values, but after learning about this escape character, this won't work anymore.</p>  <p>Is there a way to make <code>Split</code> take escape characters into account? I have checked the overload methods, and there does not seem to be such an option directly.</p>
