<p>I know similar questions have been asked before. In all the ones I am aware of I did not find a solution, and I have already tried several things on my own which I do not list for the sake of brevity.</p>  <p>In Angular I am trying to replace <code>\n</code> with <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in an escaped string which looks like <code>ABC\nDEF\n\nGHI</code>.</p>  <p>I am using <code>var replaced = original.replace(/\r?\n|\r/g, "&lt;br&gt;")</code> which works fine if <code>original</code> has not been escaped.</p>  <p>How can I obtain the same when <code>original</code> has been escaped?</p>
