<p>In my batch script I need to pass the current directory path to a program, escaped. </p>  <p>So, when my batch script is running in <code>C:\Program Files\</code> it has to pass <code>C:\\Program Files\\</code> to the called program. </p>  <p>How can I do that? Many thanks. </p>  <p>Background: The called program expects a replacement string for a regex operation, thus it will expect a group parameter when using <code>\</code> only. The data that will be targeted by the regex operation is used by a software that won't accept relative paths or environment variables. </p>
