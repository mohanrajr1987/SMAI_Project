<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer" rel="nofollow">nodemailer</a> to send an email to a client with NodeJS and expressJS, my transporter variable looks like this </p>  <p>var passHash = hash(password);</p>  <pre><code>var mailOptions = {     from: "company",     to: mail, //receiver     subject: 'subject', // Subject line     html: '&lt;a href="my.url.com:8080/reset/' + passHash + '"&gt;Click Here &lt;/a&gt;'  }; </code></pre>  <p>edit: i also want to add that when i console.log the line in "html:" will output exactly what i want it to output, which is exactly whats written there</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="my.url.com:8080/reset/abcbdc2312380089128"&gt; Click Here &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but looks like node or js in general dont like the ":" colon charachter in <strong>my.url:PORT_NUMBER</strong>  and doesnt display the link in the mail as a link at all,the service is still in development but there are some things in need to do and i need this one to work, i have tried escaping with '\\' and '\' but nothing seems to work, i will appreciete any directions, if more information is needed please let me know. thanks.</p>
