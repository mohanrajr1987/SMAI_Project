<p>I'm playing with writing into Hive tables using HCatalog. I have observed strange behavior while creating dynamic partitions in Hive.</p>  <p>Folders on HDFS created as partitions have sometimes escaped characters. After some debugging I have found source of the escaping. It is caused by method <code>escapePathName(String path)</code> in class <code>org.apache.hadoop.hive.common.FileUtils</code>. </p>  <p>There is a fraction of source code:</p>  <pre><code>if(Shell.WINDOWS){   //On windows, following chars need to be escaped as well   char [] winClist = {' ', '&lt;','&gt;','|'};   for (char c : winClist) {     charToEscape.set(c);   } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Can someone explain to me, why it is necessarily to escape these characters on Windows?</strong> </p>  <p>It is making me some problems, because when I want to write from two different servers (Windows and Linux) exactly same data to one Hive table, there are created two partitions (one with escaped characters and one without). These two partitions should be in fact only one.</p>
