<p><strong>Problem formulation:</strong></p>  <p>let's say I have a file called <code>pairs.tsv</code> where each line contains a comma separated pair of, for instance, paths to files:</p>  <pre><code>% cat pairs.tsv   path1,path2   path3,path4 </code></pre>  <p>The following code iterates through each line and splits it where the <code>comma</code> occurs and then echos each result of the split.</p>  <pre><code>for line in $(cat pairs.tsv); do   echo ${line%,*}   echo ${line#*,} % returns: path1 path2 path3 path4 </code></pre>  <p>I would like to know the meaning behind these <code>${x%,*}</code> and <code>${x#*,}</code>; especially <code>%,*</code> and <code>#*,</code> part. I know what they do, but I don't know <strong>how</strong> they do it! And what these special characters are called!</p>  <p>The reason that I am interested to understand how this is down, is to be able to replicate the same logic in other situations. Therefore, any kind of hint is greatly appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance! :) </p>
