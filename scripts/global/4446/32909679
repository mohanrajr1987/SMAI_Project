<p>Weâ€™ve been trying to submit 5 of our games to the Firefox Marketplace, but unfortunately we succeeded only with one, which is currently waiting for the review.  Afterwards we faced an issue with inability to add other games because they are published on the same domain - our game portal, plarium.com. Following manifest URLs <a href="http://screencast.com/t/nmwMj4rqrk2" rel="nofollow">haven't been validated</a>.</p>  <p>Is it required to use one domain for each game or is there another solution we can proceed with?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
