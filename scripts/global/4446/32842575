<p>Have a legacy app that has been running fine on IIS6 Windows 2003 server. Redeployed to Windows 2012 server with IIS 8.5 and now all requests get a HTTP 401.2 error.</p>  <p>The site is assigned to its own app pool which is a .net4 Classic using local Network Service account as identity. The site is set for Forms Authentication enable all others are disabled. </p>  <p>Local Network Service account has access to wwwroot directory.</p>  <p>The code deployed works fine when run in debug mode on my local development pc.</p>  <p>I am at a loss as to how to troubleshoot and fix this issue.</p>  <p>Note: although the app uses Forms authentication it does pick-up the logged on user's credentials to check if the user exists in the aspnet tables. It gets the credentials using <code>Request.ServerVariables("LOGON_USER").split("\")(1).ToUpper()</code></p>
