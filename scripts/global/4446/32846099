<p>My question is fairly straightforward: How do I upload a PHP web application to a server using Internet Information Services (IIS)?</p>  <p>I HAVE the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Completed PHP web application (folder of code files)</li> <li>IIS installed</li> <li>Registered IP address for the site</li> <li>Domain w/ login</li> </ul>  <p>In the past, I have used WinSCP to upload these kinds of web applications to servers via the command interface. Where do I begin here? Please spare me any nasty or unhelpful comments - I am not incompetent, just unfamiliar and trying to accomplish something as simply as possible.</p>
