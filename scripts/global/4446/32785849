<p>We have a tanning salon point of sale/ timer management program that stores all of our customers monthly billing information as well as a record of all their transactions, tanning bed usage, etc.  I am looking to build a website that can access this database so that customers can see their activity and adjust billing information, pay bills, and sign up for new service.</p>  <p>My question is what would be the best, most secure way of going about this project.  I have plenty of time here so there is no need to force any dumb mistakes.  If it were you, how would you build this site?  What CMS (if any), what should I avoid along the way, and what advice would you have?</p>  <p>The program we are tying into is called Helios from <a href="http://gohelios.com" rel="nofollow">http://gohelios.com</a> if that helps.  I apologize if this is a bad question, but, the company doesn't have a web app for this yet and I tired of waiting around..   Thanks in advance!</p>
