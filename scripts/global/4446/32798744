<p>HTTP is the protocol for the web, it's literally everywhere, evey language or platform has an interface or a way to deal with it.</p>  <p>I'm quite familiar with HTTP requests, responses, methods (GET, POST...) but I feel like that It's not enough and I want to dig deeper into it building blocks and how do I make the most of it when it comes to creating robust and performant web applications.</p>  <p>I was wondering if there's any good resources, courses, books, articles, or anything that covers HTTP and it's fundamentals that every professional developer should know. </p>
