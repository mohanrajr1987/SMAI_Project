<p>When writing our own WebApps in Business Catalyst, how can we present a file picker dialog box so the user can select a file which exists on the server and optionally upload a file to the server from that same dialog?</p>  <p>Business Catalyst have their own implementation of this in the WebApp admin interface and I wonder if we can hook into this. I assume it will be a matter of including a JS file (or multiple files) and then a jQuery function to hook into this.</p>  <p>Can we use BC's file picker?</p>  <p>If not, how would I go about it as I assume I would need to provide some sort of ASP connector to do the work of gathering the file/folder lists which I am assuming would not be possible to do.</p>
