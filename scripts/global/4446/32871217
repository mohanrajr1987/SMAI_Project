<p>I'm a rookie web developper and there is a lot to learn., I want to make cool webapps like text editors (nothing professional just a hobby). I want to be able to click a button and the text editor pop up when I hit the exit button the div goes display none and the javascript code stops running (for performance), i wonder if I can use if else statement and by the way, if the if statement is false, will javascript read the body (without executing it) ?</p>
