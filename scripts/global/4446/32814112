<p>I'm looking for a framework or library that we can paste in any app and make the app run the code from our app or web app..</p>  <p>Im developing a app that will check hashes.. and backup some logs from android and send some kernel debug info. but for the moment we require that the user install this app or add this code to someone else app, i was thinking if there is any way to make it work like javascript that you can paste a code in some else app and make that app have this feature from a server??</p>  <p>There is any way to do this in android(java)?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
