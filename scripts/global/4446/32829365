<p>I am working on building a web application that needs to use a standalone JAR file at its core. Essentially, I have an application module packaged as a JAR file that I can run successfully on the Command prompt using a command like: <code>java -jar myapp.jar</code> and can pass some additional parameters as needed (basically the file name to process). This JAR has some dependencies on other JAR files, which are placed in the libs folder located in the same folder as the <code>myapp.jar</code> file. All this is working fine as a standalone JAR file executed through the command prompt.</p>  <p>Now, I need to use this JAR inside a web application and do the same kind of processing. I have already got a Grails based web application setup with the required UI, etc. and I have added all the required JAR libs inside the <code>lib</code> folder of my Grails web application. I have placed <code>myapp.jar</code> file as well in the same lib folder.</p>  <p>I am a little confused about how to run this <code>myapp.jar</code> file through my web application's Controller methods? Basically, I have a form in my web application in which the users would specify the required file path needed to be processed by <code>myapp.jar</code> and then user would click the Run/Submit button. Upon that I need to launch <code>myapp.jar</code> with the supplied parameters of the file path and put the resulting/processed file at some specified location.</p>  <p>So, essentially do the processing similar to the standalone JAR execution on command prompt through the Web application's controller method.</p>  <p>Can someone kindly guide me regarding the right process to accomplish this?</p>  <p>Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.</p>
