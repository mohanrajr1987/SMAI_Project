<p>I have to make a web application where a teacher would login to a server and upload some lab tasks for the students.The students would also login wuth there credentials and see the uploaded file. Then they would submit their report in the same way. The teacher would download and see the submissions.  I must use servlet,jsp,a database,a jsf framework for this purpose. Where can I find some guidelines and tutorials for this specific purpose? Thanks in Advance.</p>
