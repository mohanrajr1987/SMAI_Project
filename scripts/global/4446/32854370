<p>I was thinking of creating a voting app. The general idea is </p>  <ul> <li>browse a gallery </li> <li>an awesome pic grabs your attention </li> <li>hit the vote button underneath it</li> <li>code magic happens</li> <li>vote is counted</li> <li>at a certain date, vote buttons become non-active and the app counts the votes</li> </ul>  <p>This will be a web app, which means html5-css3-express.js-redis framework, or something similar.</p>  <p>How can I ensure that the user cannot vote for the same pic twice? By making him sign up? Huge procedure for just a voting app, dont you think? Plus, I guess I will also need a <code>CAPTCHA</code> thing to avoid unwanted, mass sign up.</p>  <p>But if I use coockies of HTML5 local Storage API, what is stopping the same user to clear his/her coockies and vote for the same pic again and again?</p>  <p>What is the best method?</p>  <p>Thanks alot</p>
