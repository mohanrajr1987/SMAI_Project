<p>iOS 9 continues the trend to support web apps via their limited tag support as defined here:</p>  <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html</a></p>  <p>And additionally it is possible to implement functionality such as event listeners for touchstart / touchmove / touchend events. Example code here: <a href="https://github.com/freinbichler/3d-touch/blob/master/3dtouch.js" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/freinbichler/3d-touch/blob/master/3dtouch.js</a></p>  <p>But, is it possible to expose and define peek and pop functionality or other Quick Actions (App Shortcuts) options for a web app icon on the home screen?</p>
