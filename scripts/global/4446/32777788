<p>I am <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/1874" rel="nofollow">having some discussion with the Magento 2</a> guys about setting the pub or public folder as document root and need some supporting arguments.</p>  <p>Can you give example of widely used shared hosting providers where such a setup would not work out?</p>  <p>And which other widely used web apps have such a requirement as well?</p>
