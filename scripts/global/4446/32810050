<p>I wanto to build a simple e-learning web app, allowing students to only execute/access resources directly related to the current lesson, so they can stay focused. So the idea is this web app somehow becames "the only" app the student has access to, not being even able to use the operating system (windows 8). I wonder if this is even possible. Thx in advance.</p>
