<p>HLA is an easy enough language to install on virtually any platform, but I have a friend who is attempting to learn it on a machine on which she does not have administrative privileges. I've bumped into online compilers for NASM (recognizing that "compiler" is not <em>strictly</em> the right word), and I'm curious whether anyone has bumped into an online HLA?</p>  <p>The answer might well be "no", in which case NASM will have to do. All suggestions are appreciated. (She'll hopefully have a Raspberry Pi around anyway in a few months, or at least a cheap laptop.)</p>
