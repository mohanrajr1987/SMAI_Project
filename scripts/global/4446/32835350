<p>I have created my own WebApp in Business Catalyst and I want to implement a WYSIWYG editor for the multi line string custom fields.</p>  <p>Can I use the one that BC uses themselves in the WebApp admin interface?</p>  <p>I see they use radeditor and I wonder if I can implement this in my own WebApp interface?</p>  <p>I have worked around this by implementing my own tinyMCE function but the one thing I am missing is the ability to insert pictures via a dialog box file selector. I see there is a paid-plugin to tinyMCE to implement a file selector but I am not sure if this would work with Business Catalyst, or if I would then need to also implement an ASP connector along with it to find the files (which I assume we would not have access to do).</p>  <p>Can we use BC's WYSIWYG implementation in our own WebApp intefaces?</p>
