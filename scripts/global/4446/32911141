<p>I've started my first internship in software development, and when looking at hundreds of files and lines of code, it's incredibly hard to find the first line of code that will be executed once all the assemblies and "stuff" are loaded for a particular project, but I think it would be beneficial for understanding how the Web App works.. What happens step-by-step, and for that reason I want to step through each line of code from the beginning. I took a look at the automated class diagram that Visual Studio created for the project (it was some help), but I still think stepping through the entire app would be beneficial.</p>  <p>How do I debug from the first line of code executed without setting a breakpoint?</p>
