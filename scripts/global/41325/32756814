<p>I have found this nowhere on SO or in the documentation, but I would like to create a single jar containing both the binaries and the source code. My project is a mix of Scala and Java, if it adds anything to the question.</p>  <p>I've found this <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly" rel="nofollow">Github project</a> which seems interesting and might enable me to do this, but I could not manage to set it up despite of the instructions. I think it is anyway a bit overkill for my use case. Any idea ?</p>
