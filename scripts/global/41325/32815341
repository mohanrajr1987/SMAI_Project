<p>I am new to scala, when I create a scala project in intellij it took really so long to download all the jar files. I have installed the scala plugin for idea IDE. Could anyone please tell me what should I do to get on the right track? Thanks very much. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/woNdm.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/woNdm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
