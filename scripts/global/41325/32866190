<p>I'm using sbt-native-packager to build a docker image from a Scala application. There are two layers of similar size in the resulting image:</p>  <pre><code>docker history --no-trunc docker.example.com/scala-app  ... b49580a36beb6c7cd020ad006954f245aebf82041d3e79eff1517fdbf58ae6cd   About an hour ago   chown -R daemon:daemon . 125.2 MB              f12b3a929ded4161044642e117114b57889613d77186a0a727862ab5a44af5e3   About an hour ago   /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD dir:678c325d24285ae96f682c6abc3d71cc8a17ee6267a2db4fff232fcaaa5dec13 in /opt  125.2 MB ...            </code></pre>  <p>I assume that these two layers differ only in ownership (chown -R daemon:daemon .). The problem is that both of them are downloaded during pulling. Is there a way two combine these two layers into one for the sake of image size?</p>
