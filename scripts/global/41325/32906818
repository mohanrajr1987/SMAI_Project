<p>I have written a new task that I want to run before tests are executed. There are two tasks that can be used to run tests <code>test</code> and <code>testOnly</code> and so I have made both of these depend on my new task like so,</p>  <pre><code>(testOnly in Test) &lt;&lt;= (testOnly in Test) dependsOn startIntegrationTestServerIfNotAlreadyRunning (test in Test) &lt;&lt;= (test in Test) dependsOn startIntegrationTestServerIfNotAlreadyRunning </code></pre>  <p>It works but it feels a bit verbose. Is there a single task that I could make depend on my task that would achieve the same ends? </p>
