<p>I am using <code>parallelExecution in Test := false</code> in my settings, and that works great to keep my test cases from running in parallel, but it seems sbt still wants to test sub-projects in parallel.</p>  <p>Is there a way to stop that behavior?</p>  <p>I have things in sub-project tests that will conflict and crash if run at the same time.  (They run perfectly if run individually.)</p>  <p>I should add that the sub-project tests can run in any order--so long as they don't run at the same time.  (Each sub-project's test runs things on given ports that are not practical to change, so if they're run at the same time only the first works and the others get bind errors on the ports.)</p>
