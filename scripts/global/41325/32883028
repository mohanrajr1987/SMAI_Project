<p>I want to implement a precompile step in a multiproject SBT build, via a TaskKey. </p>  <p>The precompile step should search a specific directory pattern in EVERY subproject. </p>  <p>I'm looking for a cleaner approach than to recurse through all directories (maybe not every directory in root's baseDirectory is a subproject etc...). Does SBT have a key from which I can retrieve the baseDirectory of every subproject? How would you approach this?</p>
