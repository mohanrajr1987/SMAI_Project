<p>It's easy to add an assembly artifact in sbt, with <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly" rel="nofollow">sbt-assembly</a>, and also to have that artifact published. E.g.:</p>  <pre><code>assemblyOption in assembly := (assemblyOption in assembly).value.copy(includeScala = false)  artifact in (Compile, assembly) := {   val art = (artifact in (Compile, assembly)).value   art.copy(`classifier` = Some("assembly")) }  addArtifact(artifact in (Compile, assembly), assembly) </code></pre>  <p>But how can you make the assembly artifact be the only artifact published, instead of the default compilation artifact? </p>
