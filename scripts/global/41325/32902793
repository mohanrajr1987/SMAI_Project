<p>I have the following project structure:</p>  <pre><code>lazy val research = project   .dependsOn(research_common % "compile-&gt;compile;test-&gt;test")   .aggregate(research_common)  lazy val research_common = project </code></pre>  <p>Some projects will want to use the whole <code>research</code> module, but some should only use the <code>research_common</code> module</p>  <p>but I can't figure out a good way of doing this.</p>  <p>One idea I have is to create a custom classifier,  and to publish the <code>research_common</code> to that classifier, but I can't find any information on how to do something like that</p>
