<p>On my local machine I have an ivy cache that has been filled by working on multiple projects.</p>  <p>A library <code>X</code> is loaded using resolver <code>Y</code> in project <code>A</code>. This same library <code>X</code> is used in project <code>B</code>, no problems resolving this library because it's in my local cache.</p>  <p>When one of my colleagues loads project <code>B</code> he get's the error that library <code>X</code> could not be resolved. The problem: resolver <code>Y</code> is missing.</p>  <p><strong>How can I test if my sbt project has a complete set of resolvers to resolve all dependencies without removing my ivy cache?</strong></p>
