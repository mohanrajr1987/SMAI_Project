<p>I recently asked this question out of necessity (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32801052/scala-2-11-6-compile-stackoverflow-error-appears-resistant-to-advice-found-th">Scala [2.11.6] Compile Stackoverflow error (appears resistant to advice found thus far)</a>) and finally managed to get something to work based on advice given. </p>  <p><em>(Yes I will go back and answer that question properly myself but this question may help me provide a better answer)</em></p>  <p>I'm not fond of hacking things together as I would much prefer to fully understand the various options available and make intelligent choices based on the power of expanded knowledge. </p>  <p>So this current question is specifically related to the typesafe activator platform and what specific ways and means are available for sending <code>options</code> to the underlying <code>sbt</code> portion of the platform? </p>  <p><em>Brief pros and cons are OK for each if you feel so inclined however I do not want to make this a "what is the <strong>best</strong> choice" debate but merely a list of the main places one can inject <code>options</code> for the JVM and the SBT environment if/when necessary to deal with specific workload challenges.</em> </p>  <p>My situation saw me have to resort to using the command line itself as all the other routes I came across did not appear to have any effect (after I found the <code>-v</code> switch and could verify the parameters being called to run the JVM). </p>  <p>Hence this question :)</p>
