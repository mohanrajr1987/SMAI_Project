<p>I would like my compiler plugin to depend on a library, but have found no way of making sbt provide that dependency for the compiler plugin at runtime. I can trivially get sbt to fetch the library dependency, but the compiler plugin will crash over the dependency's classes with <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code>, clearly meaning the library dependency is not available to the plugin.</p>  <p>It is as if compiler plugins run in a world of their own.</p>  <p>I found this <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/6664" rel="nofollow">arcane thread</a> about this, but what it suggests is less than ideal - fatjars come with their own problems in terms of the effort of maintaining up to date dependencies.</p>  <p>What might be a practical solution, not requiring sbt-assembly? </p>
