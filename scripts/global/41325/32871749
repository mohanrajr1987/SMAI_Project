<p>With sbt it is possible to do ~run to recompile and run the program when the source changes. However once an ActorSystem is created it does not work anymore. </p>  <p>When the system is shutdown it works, but I don't want to shutdown the system.</p>  <pre><code>import akka.actor.ActorSystem  object Test {   def main(args: Array[String]) : Unit = {     val system = ActorSystem()      // if this line is removed, source code detection is disabled     system.shutdown()   } } </code></pre>  <p>Is there any workaround ?</p>
