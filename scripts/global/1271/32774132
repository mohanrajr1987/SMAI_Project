<p>I am working on a script in which the user inputs something into a textbox then the input is searched through all text files in a certain directory. However, it currently uses shell_exec like so:</p>  <pre><code>shell_exec("egrep -rHin '($input)' files/*.txt"); </code></pre>  <p>Are there any real risks to using this or is there a better way to accomplish the same thing?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
