<p>I have been looking through the different Grep tools for Windows but the recently updated ones are usually GUI (AstroGrep/grepWin) and the other common command line ones (GnuWin32/UnixUtils) doesn't seem to be able to run on my Windows 8.1 machine but runs perfectly fine on a Windows 7 VM.</p>  <p>So are there any command line grep tools avaliable for Windows 8.1 (besides findstr) or is using cygwin with the latest version of grep the only option? Thanks for the help.</p>
