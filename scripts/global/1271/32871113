<p>I used the following code on a text file with  /n as the delimiter that has about 40 million lines.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'egrep -e -i [[:alnum:]._@] file > temp &amp;&amp; mv temp file'</p> </blockquote>  <p>I need to use BRE.</p>  <p>Apparently, after doing this, I was still able to find several lines that contained / ; -, which are supposed to not be acceptable characters. . _ @ are the only acceptable non-alphanumeric characters. </p>  <p>I usually use something like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'sed -e '/string/d' file > temp &amp;&amp; mv temp file</p> </blockquote>  <p>What would the proper command be to carry this out using BRE?</p>
