<p>I've got several lines that look like this:</p>  <pre><code>aaaaaaaaxzaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbxzbbbbbbxzbb ccxzcccccccccccccccccxzc dddddddxzddddddddddddddd </code></pre>  <p>Inside two of those lines, there are <strong>two</strong> instances of <code>xz</code> characters. I want grep to look for <code>xz</code> twice in the same line and output the lines that it matches on. If <code>xz</code> appears once, I don't want to know.</p>  <p>Running the following:</p>  <pre><code>cat lines | grep "xz" </code></pre>  <p>Tells me every line with xz on, but I only want to see lines with xz appearing twice. </p>  <p>How can I make the pattern search repeat in the same line?</p>
