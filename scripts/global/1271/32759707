<p>I'm using Linux's terminal and i've got a wordlist which has words like:</p>  <pre><code>filers filing filler filter finance funky fun finally futuristic fantasy fabulous fill fine </code></pre>  <p>And I want to do a grep and a regex to match the find words with the first two letters "fi" and only show the word if it's 6 characters in total.</p>  <p>I've tried: </p>  <pre><code>cat wordlist | grep "^fi"  </code></pre>  <p>This shows the words beginning with fi.</p>  <p>I've then tried:</p>  <pre><code>cat wordlist | grep -e "^fi{6}" cat wordlist | grep -e "^fi{0..6}"  </code></pre>  <p>and plenty more, but it's not bring back any results. Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>
