<p>The answers I found while researching point towards using <code>grep</code>, especially since the arrays are not longer than 20-40 elements. </p>  <p>I have two arrays of filenames, <code>@allfiles</code> and <code>@keepfiles</code>. I want to delete the files of which the filenames are only present in <code>@allfiles</code>. <code>@allfiles</code> has more elements than <code>@keepfiles</code>.</p>  <p>I would like to use something like:</p>  <pre><code>for(my $ii=0;$ii&lt;=$allfilesSize-1; $ii++)    {     # if the current element of @allfiles is not in @keepfiles, delete the file     unless(grep(@allfiles-&gt;[$ii],@keepfiles))     {         my $command = "del &lt;value of @allfiles-&gt;[$ii]&gt;";         system($command);     }  } </code></pre>  <p>I can't figure out how to write the <code>grep</code> statement.  Either I don't know how to reference the value of the array element correctly, or not write the regex, or very possibly both. Or is there a better way to do this? </p>
