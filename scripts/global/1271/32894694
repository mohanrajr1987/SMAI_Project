<p>I'm trying to search for file that match a given pattern using <code>grep</code>.</p>  <p>This works fine when typed directly into the terminal, returns all files with "zips" in the path.</p>  <pre><code>svn st -u ~/includes ~/scripts ~/htdocs/intra ~/htdocs/update ~/htdocs/sponsor ~/survey ~/htdocs/coupon | grep "zips" </code></pre>  <p>I want to add this functionality to a bash script so I can just call <code>check zips</code></p>  <p>This is what I've got, but it's ignoring everything after the pipe and returning all output of the first command.</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash QU=$1 svn st -u ~/includes ~/scripts ~/htdocs/intra ~/htdocs/update ~/htdocs/sponsor ~/survey ~/htdocs/coupon | grep "$QU" </code></pre>  <p>How can I get this bash script to honor the <code>grep</code> call?</p>
