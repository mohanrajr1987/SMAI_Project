<p>Having trouble in bourne getting script to find a a matching string in a text file from user input. No luck searching online, the grep line just does not seem to want to work for me, ive tried multiple different variations with quotes etc. Any advice as to how i can get this to work? Cheers!</p>  <pre><code>file="/home/Jonnonield/kit104agn2/teledir.txt"  echo "Enter name or number to search directory:" read nameNumber  if grep -q $namenumber "$file"  ; then     echo "string found" else     echo "not found" fi </code></pre>
