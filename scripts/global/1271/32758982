<p>I'm new to Linux terminal; using Ubuntu Peppermint 5.</p>  <p>I want to recursively search all directories for a given text string (eg 'mystring'), in all files which have a given file extension (eg. '*.doc') in the file name; and then display a list of the file names and absolute file paths of all matches. I don't need to see any lines of content.</p>  <p>This must be a common problem. I'm hoping to find a solution which does the search quickly and efficiently, and is also simple to remember and type into the terminal.</p>  <p>I've tried using 'cat', 'grep', 'find', and 'locate' with various options, and piped together in different combinations, but I haven't found a way to do the above.</p>  <p>Something similar was discussed on: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13875380/how-to-show-grep-result-with-complete-path-or-file-name">How to show grep result with complete path or file name</a></p>  <p>and: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538987/recursively-search-for-files-of-a-given-name-and-find-instances-of-a-particular">Recursively search for files of a given name, and find instances of a particular phrase AND display the path to that file</a></p>  <p>but I can't figure a way to adapt these to do the above, and would be grateful for any suggestions.</p>
