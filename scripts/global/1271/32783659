<p>The purpose is to collapse/re-assign levels as part of cleaning a dataset. </p>  <p>Here is the example:</p>  <pre><code>df &lt;- data.frame(V1 &lt;- c("cat","lion","cat","beast","cat"),              V2 &lt;- c("nice and grumpy","angry","old,but also nice","empty","has friends"),              stringsAsFactors = F); colnames(df) &lt;- c("V1","V2") &gt;df      V1          V2 1   cat   nice and grumpy 2  lion             angry 3   cat   old,but also nice 4 beast             empty 5   cat       has friends </code></pre>  <p>The level of interest is <code>cat</code>; these are the entries:</p>  <pre><code>parse1 &lt;- V1[grepl("cat",V1)] #[1] "cat" "cat" "cat" </code></pre>  <p>From there, the idea is to search for an attribute in <code>V2</code>, <code>nice</code>, upon which the level <code>cat</code> will be renamed as <code>nice cat</code>. This search locates 2 entries of interest in <code>V2</code>:</p>  <pre><code> df.sub &lt;- subset(df,V1=="cat",select=V1:V2)  parse2 &lt;- df.sub$V2[grep("([Nn]ice)",df.sub$V2)] #[1] "nice and grumpy"   "old,but also nice" </code></pre>  <p>The ideal final result would have <code>df</code> transformed to:</p>  <pre><code>     V1                V2 1   nice cat   nice and grumpy 2   lion           king 3   nice cat   old,but also nice 4   beast           empty 5   cat        has friends </code></pre>  <p>Any thoughts how to achieve this? Many thanks.</p>
