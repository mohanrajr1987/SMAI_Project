<p>For instance if i search "tom" and it finds a string called "timtom".. is there a way to filter out timtom and only find instances of tom?</p>  <p>I usually use grep -rn "tom" .</p>  <p>I've noticed it works without the period at the end too. what is the period actually for?</p>  <p>Although my grep search works it doesn't work exactly how i want it to. </p>  <p>I've also just tried grep -r grep -i grep -ri</p>
