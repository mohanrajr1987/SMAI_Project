<p>The data I'm trying to convert is supposed to be a date, however it is formatted as mmddyyyy with no separation by dashes or slashes. In order to work with dates in R, I would like to have this formatted as mm-dd-yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy.</p>  <p>I think I might need to use <code>grep()</code>, but I'm not sure how to use it to reformat all of the dates that are in the mmddyyyy format.</p>
