<p>I have a table which i am using to query and getting its one column which matches regular expression which is <code>(\/.+\/\?)</code>. </p>  <p>Content of the resulted column is like: <code>/Anything here/?</code><br> Example output:</p>  <pre><code>\abc\cdf\?.... \ab\?.... \abc\cdf\?.... \sb\?.... </code></pre>  <p>where <code>'....'</code> can be anything </p>  <p>Desired result i want is unique values before <code>\?</code> such that rows with duplicate regexp matched content are shown once only like here (<code>\abc\cdf\?....</code> showing twice instead of onece)</p>  <pre><code>\abc\cdf\?.... \ab\?.... \sb\?.... </code></pre>  <p>OR </p>  <pre><code>\abc\cdf\? \ab\? \sb\? </code></pre>  <p>I have looked very much but couldn't find anything there is regexp_substr in oracle but that is not working in SQL.</p>  <p>Please if someone could help me with the sql query that would be awesome.</p>
