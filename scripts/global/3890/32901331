<p>I would like my ListView to be only as long as it's necessary. If I have 2 Items, height should be 2 items long, and so on. ListView is contained by TitledPane. Here's included screenshot.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IzfyA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IzfyA.png" alt="image"></a></p>  <p>All below red line should be cut off. Thank you in advance.</p>
