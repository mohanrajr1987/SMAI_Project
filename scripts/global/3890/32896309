<p>I have an old library (technical debt) that needs to stay in place for now, and it uses the AWT AffineTransform. Our new graphics code uses the JavaFX Affine. Is there a clear 1:1 mapping between the two?</p>  <p>If there is an existing FLOSS library providing this mapping as a utility, I would appreciate that reference. If not, please describe how to convert an instance of java.awt.geom.AffineTransform to an instance of javafx.scene.transform.Affine.</p>  <p>In lieu of a clear conversion path, I will accept a description of the compatibilities between the two classes and the challenges of working with both.</p>
