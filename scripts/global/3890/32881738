<p>I have got a JavaFX application with a border pane. The menu is in the top part, the content in the center part of the border pane. From the menu different parts of the application can be choosen and are then displayed in the center part. Each such part is inside a Scrollpane. Unfortunately the scrollpane either does not show at all until the window is resized. Or the content of the scrollpane can not be scrolled down to the bottom until the window is resized. How can I update the scrollpane without resizing the window? When the window is in is maximized state the problem does not occure. Also: I did a .setMaxWidth and .setMaxHeight on the stage. When I remove that code the problem does not occure either. Could the problem be a bug then?</p>
