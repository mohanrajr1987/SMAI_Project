<p>I just recognized that my program creates a <code>Daemon Thread</code> every time I play a MP3. And they're are Named "<code>Timer-XX</code>" as everybody suggest yes XX is a increasing integer starting with zero.</p>  <p>Ok I can understand that <code>JFX</code> needs them to play a MP3 but actually the MP3 is just 3 sec long and some of them stay <code>Running</code> for a couple of minutes or longer, while others normaly run out (i just suggest it should be like this).</p>  <p>I would like to know why they get created in the first place? Why they stay <code>Running</code> and how I can get ride of them because as far as I know <code>Daemon</code> dose not mean stopped so it still eats Memory and CPU what I can't give away like candy in the current state of my project.</p>  <p>Here is the code that plays the MP3s:</p>  <pre><code>public class EffectPlayer { private final String MP3_SUFFIX = ".mp3"; private final static int MAX_VOLUME = 100; private MediaPlayer mediaPlayer; private int masterVolume = 50; private int effectVolume = 50;  public EffectPlayer(File f){     if(isMP3(f)){         Media mp3 = new Media(f.toURI().toString());         mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(mp3);         effectVolume = Integer.parseInt(GetConfig.getVar("USER_OPTION_VOLUME_EFFECT"));         masterVolume = Integer.parseInt(GetConfig.getVar("USER_OPTION_VOLUME_MASTER"));         if(effectVolume &gt; masterVolume) effectVolume = masterVolume;         mediaPlayer.setVolume(1 - (float)(Math.log(MAX_VOLUME - effectVolume) / Math.log(MAX_VOLUME)));         mediaPlayer.setCycleCount(1);         mediaPlayer.play();     } }  private boolean isMP3(File f) {     return f.getName().toLowerCase().endsWith(MP3_SUFFIX); } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>The JFX Panel gets created in the class that Creates a EffectPlayer Object</p>  <pre><code>@SuppressWarnings("unused") public static JFXPanel fxPanel = new JFXPanel(); </code></pre>
