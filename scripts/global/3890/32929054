<p>I'm new to posting questions, so help me out if I post this wrong.</p>  <p>I'm a student learning Java and Android. Currently, I'm building a JavaFX application with FXML/Controllers. I haven't hit any roadblocks until now. </p>  <p>I have a section in my code that reads a file, parses it, and puts data into a JavaDB (embedded Derby) database. This part works fine, but if the file is large, it will take about 15 seconds to finish. During this time, the user can click on other things in the GUI. I wanted to alert the user and prevent further menu clicking until it finishes. I made a new pane that becomes visible, overlaying the controls, when the update button is clicked. It works, but the GUI pane does not become visible until the file reading is finished. It does this even though the pane visibility code is before the file reading code. I need it to show before the file is read.</p>  <p>Can anyone help?</p>  <pre><code>@FXML AnchorPane paneWait;  @FXML public void btnUpdateNumberSetHandle(ActionEvent event) {      System.out.println("button: update number set");      // download the file     if (numberSetMetaData.getUrlImport().length() &gt; 0) {          // this turns on the "please wait" pane         // this does not show while file is read         this.paneWait.setVisible(true);          try {             System.out.println("Attempting to download latest numbers from: "+numberSetMetaData.getUrlImport());             URL website = new URL(numberSetMetaData.getUrlImport());             String saveTo = userConfigurations.getTempFilesFolder()+"/numberSet"+numberSetID;             Path tempFolder = Paths.get(saveTo);             Files.copy(website.openStream(), tempFolder, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);             System.out.println("Successfully saved to: "+saveTo);              // the file is read here and info is saved into database             fileToDatabase.readFileToDatabase(saveTo, numberSetID);          } catch (IOException ex1) {             System.out.println("Problem downloading updated number set from: "+numberSetMetaData.getUrlImport());             ex1.printStackTrace();         }          // this turns off the "please wait" pane         this.paneWait.setVisible(false);     }   } </code></pre>
