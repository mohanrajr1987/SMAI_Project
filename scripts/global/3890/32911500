<p>I would like the user of my JavaFX app to be able to edit a text config file while running the app.  What's the best way to bring up a text file in JavaFX? I tried java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop().edit() on two systems: Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 and in both it fails.  On Ubuntu it fails with the message: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: The EDIT action is not supported on the current platform! On Windows: Caused by: java.io.IOException: Failed to edit application.properties. Error message: No application is associated with the specified file for this operation.  I guess I could associate an application for this operation but I would like something that works (almost) always without setting up the user's machine and works independently of the target OS.</p>
