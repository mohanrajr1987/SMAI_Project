<p>I have developed an application using JavaFx and compiled it to native code using ExcelsiorJet. During compilation everything works fine even when I make test run. But after compilation I am receiving this exception:</p>  <pre><code>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Error: unable to determine Application class at Unknown.&lt;unknown&gt;(Unknown Source) at Unknown.&lt;unknown&gt;(Unknown Source) at Unknown.&lt;unknown&gt;(Unknown Source) at Unknown.&lt;unknown&gt;(Unknown Source) </code></pre>  <p>I can't figure out why? Does anybody met with this kind of issue?</p>
