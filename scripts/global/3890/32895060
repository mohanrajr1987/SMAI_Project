<p>I am using the ControlsFX plugin for JavaFX on Java 8u45.  We specifically are looking at using the BreadCrumbBar to indicate to the user where we are at in a given "Workflow".  We have everything working functionally with the Breacrumb Bar but we are having trouble styling the bar, mainly individual crumbs. </p>  <p>For example if we want to style the entire bar we can use: </p>  <pre><code>breadcrumbBar.setStyle("-fx-font-weight: bold"); </code></pre>  <p>But that applies it to all crumbs, let say I want to indicate to the user that this is the crumb we are on, i.e. style the last crumb as the current page.  That doesn't seem easily doable.  It seems each crumb is a button, and I thought I could get to the button by doing something like this:</p>  <pre><code>ObjectProperty&lt;Callback&lt;TreeItem&lt;String&gt;, Button&gt;&gt; test = breadcrumbBar.crumbFactoryProperty(); Button test2 = test.get().call(bcb.getSelectedCrumb()); test2.setStyle("-fx-font-weight: bold;"); </code></pre>  <p>But that doesn't work.   Indeally I would like to put borders around all the crumbs, change their background colors and bold the current page or something like that but I can't manage to figure out how to access the CSS of a individual crumb.</p>
