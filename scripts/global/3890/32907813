<p>For a school assignment, we're working with ObservableList objects from JavaFX (Right?). I've been working on this for over a day now and can't figure it out. The teacher only tells us to 'Google it' so that's no help either..</p>  <p>Basically, we're working on a basic administration application to keep track of people and their families. Where people are member of a family, and a family can have multiple members.</p>  <p>When a person or family is added, they are added to an observableList which <em>should</em> then update an ArrayList (So the data can be serialized) and a GUI element. This is where the problem is.</p>  <p>We currently have the following implementation:</p>  <pre><code>private List&lt;Persoon&gt; personen; private List&lt;Gezin&gt; gezinnen; this.personen = new ArrayList&lt;Persoon&gt;(); this.gezinnen = new ArrayList&lt;Gezin&gt;();  private transient ObservableList&lt;Persoon&gt; observablePersonen; private transient ObservableList&lt;Gezin&gt; observableGezinnen; observablePersonen = FXCollections.observableArrayList(personen); observableGezinnen = FXCollections.observableArrayList(gezinnen); </code></pre>  <p>Then when an item is added, we do the following:</p>  <pre><code>Persoon p = new Persoon(); observablePersonen.add(p); observablePersonen.notifyAll(); </code></pre>  <p>After this when we inspect the 'personen' list, the added object isn't there :(</p>  <p>Are we missing something obvious?</p>
