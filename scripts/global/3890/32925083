<p>this should be quite an easy question for most of you. How do I properly set the parameters of PixelWriter.setPixel()?</p>  <p>I have tried to find it out for an hour now. I have of course also seen sites like that  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/image/PixelWriter.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/image/PixelWriter.html</a></p>  <p>setPixels(int x,int y,int w,int h,PixelFormat pixelformat,T buffer,int scanlineStride)</p>  <p>I know how to use the x and y parameter. And I think I know how to use the w and h parameter. But I have no idea how to use the rest.</p>  <p>I can't even manage to get it to work somehow. </p>  <p>Please be gentle I am a beginner.</p>
