<p>In JavaFx I'm creating a a StackedBarChart with this code:</p>  <pre><code>        String[] ACTIVITIES = new String[10]{ ... };// there are 10 activity names here         for (String activityName : ACTIVITIES) {              Series&lt;String, Number&gt; activitySerie = new Series&lt;String, Number&gt;();             activitySerie.setName(activityName);             stackedBarChart.getData().add(activitySerie);          } </code></pre>  <p>The result is that series from 1 to 8 has different colors. Series 9-10 have the same colors as series 1-2. I tried to specify default colors for bar charts in the style.css file but it seems that Series 9-10 actually use colors 0 and 1. I think it's a bug. Does anyone know a workaround for it?</p>
