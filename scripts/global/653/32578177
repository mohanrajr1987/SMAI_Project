<p>While compiling Burn project I'm getting following warning:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>MyBundle.wxs(111,0): warning LGHT1129: The RollbackBoundary   'rba6ABCDA022AB9852FA39D23549E335DF4' was discarded because it was not   followed by a package. Without a package the rollback boundary doesn't   do anything. Verify that the RollbackBoundary element is not followed   by another RollbackBoundary and that the element is not at the end of   the chain.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And here is my chain:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Chain&gt;   &lt;PackageGroupRef Id         = "NetFx451Redist"  /&gt;         &lt;PackageGroupRef Id         = "VC_ReDist_120" After="NetFx451Redist"   /&gt;    &lt;RollbackBoundary /&gt;                                &lt;MsiPackage      Id         = "MainProduct"                    DisplayName             = "$(var.ProductName)"                                           DisplayInternalUI       = "no"                    Visible                 = "no"                    Compressed              = "yes"                    SourceFile              = "$(var.MainProduct)"                    Vital                   = "yes"                            After                   = "NetFx451Redist"                      InstallCondition="NETFRAMEWORK45 &amp;gt;= $(var.NetFx451MinRelease)"&gt;     &lt;MsiProperty         Name                  = "DIR_PROGFILES_64_VA"         Value                 = "[DestinationDir]"/&gt;   &lt;/MsiPackage&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> So what's wrong with this RollbackBoundary here?</p>
