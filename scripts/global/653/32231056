<p>I have an asp.net project, and i want to create an installer for the deployment of the project. The installer will check if Sql Server is installed in the server, and if not, it will install it. The installer will also create and fill the database, and finally, it will create an repertory and copy the web pages and the dlls, and create the web site in IIS.</p>  <p>I have no idea how to do all this. So, can you just give the steps to follow.</p>  <p>(the deployment will be on a local server)</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
