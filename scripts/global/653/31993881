<p>Ive been digging around the internet for a satisfactory answer but I haven't found one any where. I would like to know what is happening behind the scenes when I try to install a software on my Mac OS X and it prompts me for sys admin password. Is that password accessible, at any point, to the app that is being installed? I've found an app that is asking for sys admin password with an internal prompt and I find that very very suspicious.   </p>
