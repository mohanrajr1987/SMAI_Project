<p>I have used Visual Studio installer projects and WiX. The former is absolutely inflexible from a design perspective. The latter is better but working with it is a pain. I have not encountered a professional tool that is well-suited for crafting high-end experiences like you get with, say, the Firefox installer or the Visual Studio 2015 installer itself.</p>  <p>What are these organizations using to create visually impressive installers?</p>
