<p>I'm considering to port an existing C++-based installer to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework/index.html" rel="nofollow">Qt Installer Framework</a>. There are a couple of things in the existing installer which I'd rather not change or reimplement at this time, e.g. parsing a license key. Instead, I'd like to reuse some of the existing code and build a smallish (GUI-less) utility out of it and then have the QtIFW installer call that as needed.</p>  <p>It appears that <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework/scripting-installer.html#execute-method" rel="nofollow"><code>installer.execute</code></a> could be used to call an external program - but is there a way to address a program which is not on the system yet but rather part of the installer? Maybe I could store the program to call as a resource and extract it to the temporary directory at runtime?</p>
