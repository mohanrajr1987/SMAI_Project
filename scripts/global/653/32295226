<p>I'm pretty sure there are a lots of answers, but I can't find the right search terms...</p>  <p>I have client written in Java that downloads the latest update binary. After downloading, it should execute that binary (created with install4j) and terminate.</p>  <p>Not surprisingly, Microsoft Security Essentials detects this as a trojan and deletes the file.</p>  <p>I know there are other applications doing pretty much the same - how do they do it? How can I trigger e.g. UAC where the user can confirm the execution?</p>
