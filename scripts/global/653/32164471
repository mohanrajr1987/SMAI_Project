<p>I have a .NET C# application, wrapped inside MSI installer - "myprogram.exe". I have a PHP website and a specific page where user can download the program via a link.</p>  <p>I would like to be able to track certain events on the .NET app. For example - "Program Opened".</p>  <p>It's easy to send events to my server, however how do I grab the user-id from the php server, so I can know which user did what on the .NET app?</p>  <p>I thought about passing an argument (the user-id) to the MSI installer but could not find a way to that.</p>  <p>How do I link between the PHP user-id and the .NET app?</p>  <p><strong>Clarification -</strong></p>  <p>Many people offered to use a login system to bind between the server and app.</p>  <p>This is indeed the easiest solution, however on my website I do not force the user to login to download the app (nor I request login details in the .NET app - its optional). If we dont have to ask for login details, I think we shouldn't,  the experience for the user will be much better (far less steps to use the app) - greater chance for the user to download and use the Desktop app.</p>  <p>Consider that current flow is -> Webpage - Download click - Run - Use the app (takes 10 seconds)</p>  <p>With login -> Webpage - Register (confirm email?) - Redirect - Download Click - run - app Login - Use the app (takes 60-120 seconds for the user)</p>
