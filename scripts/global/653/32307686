<p>I am new in NetBeans Platform Installer. I want to bundle JRE with installer so my application run if the <strong>Java</strong> or <strong>JRE</strong> is not installed in client machine. How can I bundle <strong>custom</strong> <strong>JRE</strong> for my installer with cross platform like <strong>Window, Linux and Mac OS</strong>. I have created installer using  NetBeans Platform Runtime Container using following URL:</p>  <p><a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-runtime-container.html" rel="nofollow">https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-runtime-container.html</a></p>
