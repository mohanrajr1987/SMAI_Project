<p>Currently we are using wix to create installer for our project. We've already implemented  for the project ( we specified  since we're automating the build process and don't want developers to have to change it manually every time )</p>  <p>However, we're binding the SVN revision to the 4th number in version ( like this : [ 1.0.0.SVNRevision ] so every SVN build create a minor upgrade that cause various problem to our installation</p>  <p>So, do we have a way to manage those minor upgrade without messing with the already implemented major upgrade? some way to just disable the installation if it is a minor upgrade would be simple and nice Thanks!</p>
