<p>In my OS X Yosemite I have a <code>.pkg</code> file . As per my requirement I need to install it in silent mode . So, I have used the command:</p>  <pre><code>sudo installer -store -pkg "/path/MyInstaller.pkg" -target / </code></pre>  <p>It works fine, but I have to show license file (<strong>EULA</strong>) on terminal. During installation it does not show the license file . In normal installation it is shown properly.</p>  <p>Is there any possible way to show the license file in command line?</p>
