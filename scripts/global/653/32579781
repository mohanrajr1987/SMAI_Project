<p>Let's say I want to distribute a Java desktop app in a native-like way. Is there a tool/technique to build Java desktop application installers that will automatically and seamlessly install a JVM if one does not exist on a system already?</p>  <p>Installing Java apps for users who do not have a JVM is a 2-step process (first install the JVM, then the app). I'd like to match the experience of installing a typical native desktop app by making it a one-step process (or as much one-step-ish as possible).</p>
