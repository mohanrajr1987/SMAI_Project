<p>When I try to install msxml6_x86.msi on windows 8 embedded  I do not get a error. It will say setup is complete click finish. However if you try to remove it by doing add remove programs it is not there. The msi  works on windows xp just fine. The link I am using is below. There should be a way to make this work right ? </p>  <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3988" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3988</a></p>
