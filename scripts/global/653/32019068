<p>I have an InstallShield 2013 project that puts a shortcut into the Startup folder. When I run the installer, the shortcut is placed correctly and seems to have the correct path information. All seems well.</p>  <p>Then I look at the startup information provided by the windows task manager. The startup entry reads. Name: InstallShield Publisher: Flexera Software LLC</p>  <p>When using the right click "Open File Location", the path opened is not the path of the generated shortcut. Instead, it is C:\Windows\Installer{GUID}\NewShortcut2_{HexString}.exe</p>  <p>Why is this happening, and how do I change it?</p>  <p>Edit: The testing has been done on a windows 8.1 system.</p>
