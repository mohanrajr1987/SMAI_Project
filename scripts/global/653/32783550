<p>I have created a .pkg installer with productbuild containing other .pgk created with pgkbuild. These are all flat packages. However, I need to also include a bundle-style package from a third-part party. Is there a possible way to do this?</p>  <p>I have tried to flatten the bundle-style package, however this creates and invalid package (productbuild: error: Package at "Name.pkg" is not valid.).</p>  <p>I have tried creating a .mpkg with Iceberg containing both package style. However Icerberg only support bundle-style packages.</p>  <p>Is there a possible way to do this?</p>
