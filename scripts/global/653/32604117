<p>Atm I create a Setup-Project for an applikation. For that I try to edit Windows installer dialogs in order to create a custom dialog with the help of this guide. <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18834/Create-custom-dialogs-for-use-in-your-Visual-Studio" rel="nofollow">codeprojekt.com</a></p>  <p>It seems like this guy is editing a .wid file. But i only can open .wid files and save them as .msi, which is not exactly what i want. </p>  <p>Since I am not able to "save as wid", i cant use a dialog in VS 2010. What am i missing?</p>
