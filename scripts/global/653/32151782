<p>We have a per-machine install package built with WiX 3.9.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Package InstallerVersion="405" Compressed="yes" InstallScope="perMachine" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And we are also using <code>WixShellExec</code> to launch an application from a <code>CustomAction</code> as part of the package install.</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;Property Id="WixShellExecTarget" Value="[#Application.exe]" /&gt;     &lt;CustomAction Id="LaunchApplication" BinaryKey="WixCA" DllEntry="WixShellExec" Impersonate="yes" /&gt;     &lt;InstallExecuteSequence&gt;         &lt;Custom Action="LaunchApplication" After="InstallFinalize"&gt;NOT Installed&lt;/Custom&gt;     &lt;/InstallExecuteSequence&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This launches our application as expected, but it launches the application with elevated permissions.</p>  <p>From what we have seen, it is not possible to launch the application without elevated permissions from a per-machine install package. We have tried various combinations of <code>Impersonate="yes|no"</code> and <code>Execute="deferred|immediate"</code>. We have also tried using a <code>FileKey</code> custom action directly to launch the application.</p>  <p>We are using a custom bootstrapper application and so cannot use the <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/howtos/ui_and_localization/run_program_after_install.html" rel="nofollow">built-in WiX UI</a> around this functionality. Is the only way to achieve a non-elevated launch of our application to do so manually from our custom bootstrapper application?</p>
