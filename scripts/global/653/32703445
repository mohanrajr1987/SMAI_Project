<p>I recently finished an application I made (written on Java). So I looked to find an installer to create a setup that most software have nowadays. I found Inno which has some features I really wanted (like to add a password and set the path of installation). However there is one thing I'm looking for.</p>  <p>After the installation, can I somehow make my program not to run at other computers if someone will copy my .exe file from one PC to another? Since my application is just one .exe file that my installer extracts at the path of installation (example at C:\Program Files\MyApp, there is only 1 file, app.exe. Can I somehow do that if someone will copy that .exe file from program files, it won't work on other computers? </p>  <p>I'm kinda new to programming and all that stuff, so I don't know that much. Maybe with registry key? If yes, any good example/tutorial?</p>  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> My application can't work with copy/paste to a new computer, only with a normal installation from the installer setup that I created by Inno. Is it possible?</p>  <p>Kinda off-topic question but can I sell my application? Inno is a freeware software, however I don't know if it's legal to sell applications that you made an installer with Inno.</p>
