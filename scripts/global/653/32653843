<p>So, I know a lot of questions have been asked around here about manifests but I haven't quite found what I was looking for in terms of explanation. Basically I need a manifest for the installer of a Delphi application. Now most guides I see on manifests say to create a .manifest file and a .rc file then add {.$R 'file.res' 'file.rc'} in the application so that it sees it when it starts and to place the files alongside the .exe.</p>  <p>Now where I'm confused is that my manifest is for an installer, I can't place the files alongside the installer, logically, as it is its job to put the files where they need to go. Now I'm not going to send a package with an installer and 2 other random files to people obviously. So I'm just trying to figure out how the manifest can work for an installer. Thanks!</p>
