<p>I have a C++ project that depends on a four external dlls. I can compile my project fine in Visual Studio, so I know my C++ compiler and linker reference paths and libraries are correct. I had to copy the dlls to the Release and Debug directory to allow the dlls to be loaded when I run the executable.</p>  <p>When I come to build the installer, the external dlls are not listed as detected dependencies in the installer explorer. If I copy the dlls to the Release or Debug directory for the project, two of the dlls are detected but two aren't.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>I tried running Dependency Walker on the Debug version and it detected all four dlls correctly. Is there some way to export the result of Dependency Walker into the Detected Dependencies in VS?</p>
