<p>The Polymer Starter Kit contains web-component-tester for unit testing your custom elements. In wct.conf.json you can specify the browsers to run the tests in.</p>  <pre><code>{   "suites": ["app/test"],   "plugins": {     "local": {     "browsers": ["firefox"]   } } </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately, when I launch the tests through gulp, wct is not able to find my local Firefox. I read at <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester/issues/50" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a> that wct uses launchpad to detect local browsers. Afaik, on a Windows machine, launchpad searches for Firefox in the default directory "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox". But I installed Firefox in a different directory.</p>  <p>Is there any way to configure the path to my Firefox dir in wct.conf.json?</p>
