<p>I am doing animation on transform property. Everything works fine in chrome, but when I test the same in firefox or edge its not working.</p>  <p>this is my animation </p>  <pre><code>    {'transform': transformFrom},     {'transform': transformTo}, </code></pre>  <p>transformFrom = transform: translateY(77px) scale(0.941667); transformTo = transform: translateY(70px) scale(0.911667); </p>  <p>and on neonAnimationFinish, I am setting the new transform property to the element. This works fine in chrome but not in any other browser.</p>  <p>If I remove the animation and set the property normally, then its working in other browsers too. I checked the element in browser console and transform property is not attached to it after animation.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank youï»¿</p>
