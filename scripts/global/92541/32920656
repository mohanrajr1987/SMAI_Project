<pre><code>&lt;template is="dom-bind"&gt;     &lt;custom-element&gt;&lt;/custom-element&gt;     &lt;iron-ajax auto url="data.json" handle-as="json" last-response="{{data}}" on-response="receivedResponse"&gt;&lt;/iron-ajax&gt; &lt;/template&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In the example above "custom-element" needs to know when iron-ajax has received a response. The problem is that I don't know where to put the "receivedResponse" method. How do I do this? I prefer to put it inside "custom-element", but then I don't know how to bind it to the "on-response" event of iron-ajax.</p>  <p>I could bind the "{{data}}" to a property of "custom-element" and have an observer for that property, but that feels like a hack and I'd like to find out the correct way of doing this.</p>
