<p>I'd like to ask you people about workflow with Polymer. I know that I should use my own elements or double check if element that I need isn't alredy published. It's really nice, I admit it. However the Polymer Starter Kit comes as single-page app. Is it the recommended approach for using Polymer? What about large pages that would need a lot of data to be loaded? Are there alternative approaches?</p>
