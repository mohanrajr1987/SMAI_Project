<p>I try to bind a CSS Class to a <code>paper-progress</code> with the value of my property for change the item's color. I base my code on the Polymer's example on <a href="https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-progress/blob/master/demo/index.html" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a> and the documentation of Data-binding.</p>  <p>Here my code: <a href="http://jsbin.com/bidebe/10/edit?html,output" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/bidebe/10/edit?html,output</a></p>  <p>The class of the <code>paper-progress</code> changes correctly, but the color doesn't. If I put the class color directly, the color is correct.</p>  <p>So I don't understand why my <code>paper-progress</code> has the good class but doesn't apply it. If someone can help me to understand that, thanks.</p>
