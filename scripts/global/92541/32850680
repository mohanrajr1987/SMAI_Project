<p>I'm getting my feet wet with Polymer.  I am wanting to create a stand-alone app that can be injected into multiple implementations.  Like this:</p>  <p></p>  <p>Inside my-app element, I may also have many sub-elements.  It's my understanding that every element needs to import polymer.html.  Should all of the sub-elements rely upon the parent (root) element to import polymer.html?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
