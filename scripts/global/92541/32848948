<p>I am using Polymer data-binding. I add elements to an array and it, in turn, adds elements to the DOM which get displayed vertically.</p>  <p>I would like the page to scroll as elements are added but only if the current scroll height is at the bottom of the page.</p>  <p>Rough sudo code:</p>  <pre><code>if (scrollToBottomEanbled &amp;&amp; atBottomOfPage) {     window.scrollTo(document.body.scrollWidth, document.body.scrollHeight); } </code></pre>  <p>But given that Polymer works with templates and shadow DOMS etc, I don't know which event I should be attaching this code to?</p>
