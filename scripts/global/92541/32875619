<p>We are currently working on a project, in which we use a combination of AngularJS and Polymer. </p>  <p>We have some structure, but what's really important is this piece of code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;template is="dom-bind" angupoly="{dataContainer:'dataContainer'}"&gt;     &lt;menu-list for="places" data="{{dataContainer.getSomeData()}}"&gt; &lt;/template&gt; </code></pre>  <p>We have a variable defined on $scope named dataContainer, which is being set in a controller. The problem is that this code is executed before the controller prepares that property, so it's undefined - it throws:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[dom-bind::_annotatedComputationEffect]: compute method <code>dataContainer.getSomeData()</code> not defined</p> </blockquote>  <p>And the data are never refreshed again and it does not work. On the contrary, with a property it works (it does not matter if it's first state is undefined), it is refreshed.</p>  <p>Because it's a really important point in our application, we wanna ask. How to reach required behaviour? </p>  <p>Thanks, have a nice day! :)</p>
