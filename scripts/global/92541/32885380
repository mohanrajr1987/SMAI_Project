<p>I'm trying to connect nodes using SVG in my Polymer app, and to do that I need to dynamically add a <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> to my SVG container. Seems pretty straightforward, but Polymer throws the following error: </p>  <p><code>"Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': Only one element on document allowed"</code></p>  <p>This error happens when Polymer gets loaded twice, but all I'm doing is appending something. I can't figure out what's happening, especially since similar code somewhere else in my app simply works. The offending lines:</p>  <pre><code>_connectNodes: function(){     _.each(this.nodeRelations, function(relation){       var newPath = document.createElement('path');       var path = Polymer.dom(this.$.connectionsContainer).appendChild(newPath);     })   } </code></pre>
