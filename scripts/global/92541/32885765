<p>What is the best practice for linking a script to the <code>index.html</code> in polymer. I have a menu on in my index file and what to use <code>dom-if</code> to hide certain buttons depending on the users permission. That permission check uses <code>ajax(iron-ajax)</code>. I am unsure how to link Polymer(<code>{}</code>), to the index, as the index is not a custom element.</p>
