<p>With the recent release of Polymer 1.0 I was hoping to use the Paper Elements in a ASP.NET MVC/Microsoft Stack, or at least check them out.</p>  <p>I have used nuget in the Visual Studio package manager to attempt to install polymer:</p>  <pre><code>    PM&gt; Install-Package polymer     Installing 'polymer 1.0.0'.     Successfully installed 'polymer 1.0.0'.     Adding 'polymer 1.0.0' to Eqs.Mvc.Web.     Successfully added 'polymer 1.0.0' to Eqs.Mvc.Web.      PM&gt; Install-Package paper-button     ...long long list of dependency imports </code></pre>  <p>When I try to import paper-elements.html I notice that in paper-elements.html there are missing files and files in the wrong locations. For example in paper-elements.html: </p>  <p><code>&lt;link rel="import" href="../polymer/polymer.html"&gt;</code> </p>  <p>is actually located in the project at the scripts root:</p>  <p><code>&lt;link rel="import" href="../polymer.html"&gt;</code></p>  <p>I get a lot of 404 errors.  Did I import the packages incorrectly?</p>
