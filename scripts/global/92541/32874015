<p>I just updated to the latest version of Polymer, and it seems like the behavior of <code>paper-icon-item</code> has changed. According to the source documentation for version 1.0.3, <code>paper-icon-item</code> now conforms to the <code>iron-control-state</code> and <code>iron-button-state</code> behaviors.</p>  <p>I have two issues: I'm now getting "focused" and "pressed" added to my elements whenever I interact with them in those ways. That's fine, however, an annoying focus border is being added to my elements, and I can't figure out how to style it away with CSS.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YRZ1T.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YRZ1T.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5hMVC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5hMVC.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>At what point in the CSS stack can I access the focus border?</p>  <p>My other issue is that the elements (which are inside an <code>iron-list</code>) are now seemingly permanently in toggle mode, so clicking a selected item will deselect it, even though I haven't explicitly set the toggle behavior anywhere. According to the Polymer documentation, the <code>toggles</code> behavior <em>should</em> be set to <code>false</code> as the default.</p>  <p>Can anyone offer some insight to these behaviors? I need the cells to be non-toggling and with no focus border.</p>
