<p>I started to build a web application for HR Management and thought of applying Material Design concepts for interface. When I searched I found there are many frameworks for it such as</p>  <ol> <li>Angular Material</li> <li>Materialize</li> <li>Polymer</li> </ol>  <p>I want to select one of these material design frameworks for my project. There are couple of concerns I have about these frameworks.</p>  <ol> <li>What is the stability and the future maintainability of framework</li> <li>How easy to customize the framework according to our new requirements and components</li> <li>Do others use the framework</li> <li>Which has most of the features</li> </ol>  <p>By considering above concerns can some one advice me what to use as the Material Design framework?</p>
