<p>I'm getting started with Polymer particularly with iron-ajax for retrieving JSON data from an ASP.Net WebAPI service. I'm able to make a call to the service, however I'm not able to get to the results returned from the service.</p>  <p>Here's my iron-ajax element:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;iron-ajax auto                url="http://local.webapi2.com/api/values"                headers='{ "Key": "d72ad080-e3dd-43ea-ba95-0cd2a5a58bb1" }'                handle-as="json"                content-type="application/json"                method='GET'                verbose="true"                on-response="handleResponse"&gt;&lt;/iron-ajax&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here's my handleResponse function:</p>  <pre><code>    handleResponse: function (jsonFromServer)     {         console.log('response from server:', jsonFromServer);     } </code></pre>  <p>Here's my WebAPI endpoint:</p>  <pre><code>[RoutePrefix("api/values")] public class ValuesController : ApiController {     // GET api/values     [Route("")]     public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()     {         return new string[] { "value1", "value2", "value3", "value4", "value5", "value6" };     } } </code></pre>  <p>I'm using the Firefox browser. Using Firebug's Net tab, I can see the call to <a href="http://local.webapi2.com/api/values" rel="nofollow">http://local.webapi2.com/api/values</a> and I can see the results returned:</p>  <pre><code>["value1","value2","value3","value4","value5","value6"] </code></pre>  <p>However, in Firebug's Console, I only see this:</p>  <pre><code>response from server: response  </code></pre>  <p>Where 'response' is an object that appears to be detail information about 'iron-ajax' element itself.  The expected results data is never displayed in the console.  Furthermore, the Response tab of the WebAPI call in the console has null as a value.  There's not even a JSON tab in the detail under the WebAPI call in the console.</p>  <p>I'm not sure why the Net tab has the complete and accurate results as you would expect, but the Console tab nulls out and I'm presented with a 'response' object.  </p>  <p>I'm experiencing this same situation in Chrome too.</p>  <p>What am I missing? Is it a configuration issue? Thank you for your time.</p>
