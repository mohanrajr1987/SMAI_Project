<p>I have this problem with scale-up animation! I want to expand an element with scale-up-animation. I want in the same element, one part to be always displayed, like i have in this example  <a href="http://jsbin.com/zabozu/edit?html,console,output" rel="nofollow">enter link description here</a> , the grey part to be always on screen, and the red part to appear with animation. </p>
