<p>I'm currently starting to work on the project using polymer. I'm able to set up and view the page using the polymer elements after setting up HTTP server using python -m SimpleHTTP server.</p>  <p>However when i tried to run it in WAMP, copying the project folder to root destination (www). I couldn't view the page properly &amp; it is blank. May i know if i need to set up anything else to have it work on WAMP as well.</p>
