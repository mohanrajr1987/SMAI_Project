<p>Let's say I have a use case named "addSalesForecast" and I have two actors : the shop manager and the CEO  Well the shop manager can only add sales forecasts for his own shop on the other hand the CEO can add sales forecasts for all the shops. So the difference would be that the CEO will have to select a shop first then add the forecast (the shop manager will have direct access to add the forecast). I thought that I can solve this by adding an "If" in the scenario for example : "if the user is the CEO then he will have to select a shop first".</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
