<p>I have a couple of questions regarding sequence diagrams and was wondering if someone could please point me in the right direction.</p>  <p>This is the diagram I have come up with so far:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KyF01.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/KyF01.png</a></p>  <p>I am unsure however if this is correct.</p>  <p>The following is the questions I have regarding this diagram, and sequence diagrams in general: </p>  <p>First off, I am wondering if I need a loop at all since adding another employer is not pragmatic but rather dependent upon the user clicking "add another employer" on a dialogue that is displayed.</p>  <p>If a loop is required, is there a way to properly specify a do while loop? because the diagram looks slightly confusing with a loop condition "while add another employer" yet add another employer is determined within the "if detailsValid" section after calling "displayAddAnotherEmployer()"</p>  <p>If I have a condition such as the "save employer details" condition, do I still need to show the employer liaison officer clicking the save employer details and interacting with the view? or is this implied by the if condition?</p>  <p>Can actors have an execution on their lifeline?</p>  <p>Lastly, in the "else if cancel" condition, do I need a "break" with a condition "if add another employer" or is that implied when the view is closed?</p>  <p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and any help would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>EDIT: A second version of the same diagram, which one is clearer? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8BlgX.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/8BlgX.png</a></p>
