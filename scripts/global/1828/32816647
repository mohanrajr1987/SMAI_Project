<p>I have a class in a Jdeveloper diagram that should have this UML signature:</p>  <pre><code>+ extract(bytes:Byte[*]) </code></pre>  <p>however, Jdeveloper is not allowing to do this. A pop up window open up, forcing me to chose the <code>OwnedParameter</code> type from a list of Available Objects. Such objects include all the custom classes already declared in the projects (e.g. MyClass, OurClass...etc) plus a list of very few <code>PrimitiveTypes</code> such as String, Integer. Byte and other relevant Java types are not present.</p>  <p>If I follow the other way round, which is create a java class, and then transform it in a UML Class, the diagram will show the class with the correct signature and no complaining at all.</p>  <p>I couldn't find what make the generated UML class different from the one created in the diagram. So I can't create class with a signature containing Byte.</p>
