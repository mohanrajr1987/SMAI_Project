<p>The Image below is a simple use case of a cashier System. The flow is as follows for the general flow of a check-out</p>  <ol> <li>Cashier scans item(s)</li> <li><p>Cashier select a payment method</p>  <p>2.A.1 Cashier select payment via credit card</p>  <p>2.A.1 Cashier swipe the credit card onto the reader</p>  <p>2.A.3 Payment is done</p>  <p>2.B.1 Cashier select payment via cash</p>  <p>2.B.2 Cashier input amount received.</p>  <p>2.B.3 System display the change to be given to customer.</p>  <p>2.B.4 Payment is done</p></li> <li><p>Check-out completed.</p></li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5rmJ0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5rmJ0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The question i wish to know if it is valid for the extend to be used in this scenario, where either one of them will occur when a payment is made. Based on my understanding is that extend  means the base case has the option to call the extension. Does my use case model means that there is a possibility that both method are not called (which should not be the case)?</p>
