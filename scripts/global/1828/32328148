<p>I have previously been modeling with Visual Paradigm. There I had lots of possibilities to control the Lifetime of my Objects.</p>  <p>What I mean exactly is that dashed array symbolizing the creation of an object and the cross at the end of the lifeline, symbolizing that the object has been finalized.</p>  <p>I did some research, and according to <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/8.0/modeling_languages/sequencediagram.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> webpage EA does this Support somehow. In the picture below (found in the link) note how ":Cart Item" is created and finished. How do I do that?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/q9sIv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/q9sIv.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
