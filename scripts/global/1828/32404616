<p>I must be missing something. I am reading <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/working-with-diagrams.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> and it says that there is a plugin called "UML Support" which is enabled by default. I didn't have it, so I went to Preferences > Plugins and see no such plugin. Searching didn't show it as well.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/viewing-class-hierarchy-as-a-class-diagram.html" rel="nofollow">This page</a> which is a sub-page of the previous one says I should be able to press <kbd>CMD</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Option</kbd><kbd>U</kbd> and a diagram will come up. That doesn't work, and I also don't see a Diagram > Show Diagram on any context menu for my files in the project.</p>  <p>How can I see UML Diagrams of my codebase? It looks like it should be straightforward but I don't see any of these in Intellij 14.1.4</p>
