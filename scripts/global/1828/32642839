<p>I have to generate class diagrams from the java files such that the parser must be executable on the command line with the following format:</p>  <p>umlparser classpath output_file_name</p>  <p>umlparser is my .java file name</p>  <p>classpath is a folder name where all the .java source files will be</p>  <p>output file name is the name of the output image file you program will generate ( .jpg, .png or .pdf format)</p>  <p>Tools for parsing Java Source and generating UML diagrams can be used.</p>  <p>I was looking at <a href="http://yuml.me/diagram/class/draw" rel="nofollow">http://yuml.me/diagram/class/draw</a> and found that that is a good way to generate the class diagram. </p>  <p>However, I can't get the idea how can I get the code in the form of </p>  <pre><code>[Customer|forname:string;surname:string|doPost();doGet()]&lt;&gt;-orders*&gt;[Order] [Order]++-0..*&gt;[LineItem] [Order]-[note:Aggregate root{bg:wheat}] </code></pre>  <p>Any insight on how to generate this code?</p>  <p>Any other suggestions are also welcomed.</p>
