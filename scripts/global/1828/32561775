<p>I have two components A and B. I want the model to show that they both &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;use&gt;&gt; the third component. Which picture is correct, the top or bottom one?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bV5UY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bV5UY.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
