<p>Beginer in UML, I have the followings rules for an Aikido club management:</p>  <p>R1: Every member should participate to the training practices.</p>  <p>R2: The trainees can come from other clubs in the same city or country as well as abroad.</p>  <p>I identify 2 classes:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rMgNQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rMgNQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>To take into account the second rule:</p>  <ul> <li>Member (1) and Trainee (0..1)</li> <li>Trainee(1.. *) and Training (1.. *)</li> </ul>  <p>Is there a correct way in what I am doing?</p>
