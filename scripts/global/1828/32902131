<p>I have the following relationship:</p>  <pre><code>===========        =====================          ============ | building|-1----M-| building_occupant |-M------1-| occupant | ===========        =====================          ============ </code></pre>  <p>I'm supposed to write a Association class in java. I'm new to this language so I'm not sure whether there already exists some built-in data structure or functionality that fits this design (without using a database.. has to be a class). Is there a way to store the data in such as way that I can retrieve multiple rows with one request? ..E.g.: </p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM house_occupant Where occupant_id = 1;  </code></pre>  <p>Basically, I need help finding the best implementation design for this relationship using classes.</p>  <p>NOTE: No persistence required.</p>
