<p>I am trying to install UMLGraph to generate a .dot file from java class. I will be using this .dot file to feed to Graphviz(a PNG class diagram generator) .  However, I am facing certian issues while the installation .  The official UML installation guide umlgraph.org is woefully difficult to understand. Can someone please give manual steps to install and configure UMLGraph for windows ?</p>  <p>I have tried below things on my system : </p>  <ol> <li>Installed JAVA JDK and JRE 7 in C:/Program Files.</li> <li>Downloaded the UMLGraph-5.7_2.3-SNAPSHOT.zip file from <a href="http://www.umlgraph.org/download.html" rel="nofollow">UMLGRAPH DOWNLOADS</a></li> <li>Created a new folder : D:/UMLGraph/ </li> <li>Copied the entire "lib" and "bin" folder from the extracted .zip umlgraph file and pasted it in the folder created at step 3. </li> <li>Now , I changed the path of <em>UMLGRAPH_HOME</em>  to = D:/UMLGraph/lib folder as suggested in the official website.</li> <li>Then I copied my UMLGraph.jar file to the location where I have my java related tools.jar file (at C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_80\lib). </li> <li><p>Finally I tried to run the java -jar command as seen in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/fsnet/wiki/HowToGenerateUmlFromCodeWithUmlGraph" rel="nofollow">the unofficial umlgraph instruction</a> as belows :</p>  <p><code>java -jar C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_80/lib/UmlGraph.jar -all -private A.java</code></p></li> </ol>  <p>When I ran the above command,I got the error! "<strong>Unable to access JARFILE C:/PROGRAM</strong>"</p>  <p>Please let me know if I am doing something wrong. <br> <br> <strong>UPDATE</strong> : Thanks a lot guys. Finally I installed jdk and jre 1.8 . There are no more java issues.  I finally ran the below command :  C:/Users/xyz > java -jar "C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_60/lib/UmlGraph.jar" -all -private "D:/xyz/abcd/uml-parser-test-1/" .</p>  <p>The uml-parser-test-1 contains all about 5 .java files and I wish to create a single UML diagram out of them ( They are all linked to eachother in java code).</p>  <p>When I run above code , I get an error :  <strong>UMLGRAPH ERROR - ILLEGAL PACKAGE NAME</strong></p>  <p>So my final query is :  <strong>How canI ask my UMLPARSER to generate a single diagram for all the underlying .java classes within a package ?</strong></p>
