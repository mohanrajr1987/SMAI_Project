<p>I am struggling with modeling a specific scenario. Let's say we have a super class and three subclasses. </p>  <p>The subclasses share a list of methods from the super class. However, there is one method which is needed to be shared by two out of three classes. So, I thought of two scenarios: </p>  <ol> <li><p>Adding the method in the two subclasses. If I do that though, I will have code duplication since the implementation of the method is same. </p></li> <li><p>Keep the method in the super class to avoid code redundancy based on scenario one above. However, wouldn't that allow the third class to inherit the method? Which defeats the purpose. </p></li> </ol>  <p>So, any ideas on how to model such a scenario ? </p>
