<p>I am on a review of a business process models. I am experienced in UML but not in BPML. The problem I have is that the process models includes user tasks which looks like user actions(from UML) e.g. user press button, user saves, etc. and some technical activities like establishing connection etc.</p>  <p>As far as I know the process model is high level overview and not this kind of granular actions which describes detailed user interactions.  Questions:</p>  <ol> <li>Is it correct that a business process model includes kind of user actions like "Press save button"?</li> <li>How granular should be the BPMN user/service tasks?</li> </ol>
