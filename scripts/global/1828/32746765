<p>Assuming that sequence-diagram alternatives should be somewhat interchangeable, how does one deal with an alternative leaving lifelines with a different number of (possibly nested) activations than it encountered at the beginning? For example, here are sequence diagrams for a "ready" case, a "not-ready" case, and a failed attempt to combine those cases in a single sequence diagram using "alt". (Sorry about the diagrams--I couldn't figure out how to top align them.)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jjsCN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jjsCN.png" alt="ready case"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xp8aE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xp8aE.png" alt="not-ready case"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k7l9X.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k7l9X.png" alt="combined cases"></a></p>  <p>Looking at the last, "combined cases" diagram, notice that the first, "ready case" alternative is presented with one activation each of A and B and none for C. However, because this alternative creates new activations for B and C, the second, "not-ready case" alternative is presented with a different set of activations. I could add various messages at the end of "ready case" to arbitrarilly leave it with the same activations it originally encountered, but surely there is a better way, or am I missing something, e.g., I'm using alt incorrectly?</p>  <p>BTW, I generated these diagrams with <a href="http://plantuml.com" rel="nofollow">PlantUML</a>.</p>
