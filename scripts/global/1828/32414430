<p>I'm starting to develop a board game in C++ using OpenGL. Before starting, I want to draw the UML diagram, as shown bellow.</p>  <p>The game has:</p>  <ul> <li><p>A board that contains a desktop, a footer and the points of both players to show.</p></li> <li><p>Pieces to put on the board</p></li> <li><p>Followers (soldiers)</p></li> <li><p>Mouse events</p></li> <li><p>A set of rules that the players must obay in order to play</p></li> </ul>  <p>Something like The Risk, of Monopoly, etc</p>  <p>I'm not an expert in UML, so by looking at what I've written so far, <strong>do you think the UML (arrows and relations) is accurate with the description?</strong></p>  <p><strong>What would you change, and why?</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tbewr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tbewr.png" alt="UML for the game"></a></p>
