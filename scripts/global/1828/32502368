<p>I was trying to follow the uml diagram from this link <a href="http://www.uml-diagrams.org/android-camera-uml-class-diagram-example.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uml-diagrams.org/android-camera-uml-class-diagram-example.html</a>. <br><br>In the CameraDemo class we find "/" after every access specifiers like +,#,_ for methods such as onStart(),onStop(). <br><br> (Example: #/onStart() )<br><br> What does "/" mean in there.</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.</p>
