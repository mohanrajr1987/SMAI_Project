<p>I've been developing an Android app for a while but I didn't start with any particular diagram. And now comes the time to do some real diagrams but I don't know how. Not because I'm not familiar with UML but because of Android and it's components. </p>  <p>For example, my app requires that the user needs to be logged in in order to see a menu. From there the user can choose the options he wants. The user can also do his registration.</p>  <p>Although this might be a silly and simple example...The point is...I didn't use any class named "Person" with getters and setters; or any class named "Request" with getters and setters and other methods.  My app use classes like "Login.class", "SignIn.class", "MenuActivity.class", "HistoryActivity.class".</p>  <p>My question is...how do I use UML for an Android app? I mean I can't have a conceptual model diagram that says "Person"-----"Request", right?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
