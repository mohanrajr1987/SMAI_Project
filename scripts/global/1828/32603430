<p>I need to generate some UML diagrams from my SQL snippets. Optimally I'd like a text box to paste my statements and get an UML diagram in return. Is that possible in EA? I looked around but couldn't find a way - every source I discovered is about the reverse process.</p>  <p>Basically,</p>  <p>From:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE something ( ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, date DATE NOT NULL, comment VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL); </code></pre>  <p>To: <em>box that says the same</em></p>  <p>/edit: By box I mean a class diagram component, like here: <a href="http://www.icodeguru.com/design/Enterprise-Architect/classdiagram.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.icodeguru.com/design/Enterprise-Architect/classdiagram.png</a></p>
