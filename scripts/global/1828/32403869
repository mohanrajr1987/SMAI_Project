<p>I thought I could differentiate between <strong>event</strong> and <strong>guard</strong>. But I came across an event being similar to guard:</p>  <pre><code>counter &gt; 4 [pin is high] / switch on ^^^^^^^^^^^     event </code></pre>  <p>where I viewed the variable counter changes from some value smaller than 4 to that greater than 4 as event. Does that mean event can also be a condition like guard?</p>
