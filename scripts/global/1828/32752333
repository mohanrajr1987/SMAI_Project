<p>I am a newbie in system design and I am having some confusions on creating use case design. I am making a web system with API support sub-system which will be consumed by the android app. The web system and API will be produced as separate app bus use same data layer and are totally in different server (Tomcat-Web system and Jetty server-API). So, my question is that do I need to produce separate Use case design for each web system and API system or make single which will contain functions of both. And I am confused that if I make single use case diagram, then while producing class diagram, the domain object of two system might be related but in the actual implementation the web and api system will be a separate app.</p>
