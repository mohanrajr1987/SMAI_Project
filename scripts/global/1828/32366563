<p>I have the same function for 2 different modules.<code>Low Stock alert</code> is a function which is required by both admin and the storekeeper. Both have different ways to access this function. For admin, he has a menu tab from where he checks the low stocks whereas the storekeeper has a home screen where the low stocks are shown when he clicks the "low stocks" button.</p>  <p>My question is will I have to list only one use case for these two functions as the function name is same or different use cases as the process to access the "low stock" function is different? I have to make a high level usecase as well as expanded usecase.</p>
