<p>i want to make a sequence diagram, which shows the login process in an .Net MVC Webapp (i.e. webshop). I am quite new to UML modeling, so i am not sure, how to build the interaction between, Controller, model and view. I found different solution online. Here are some question i have:</p>  <ol> <li>Does the client interact with the view, or directly with the Controller (in my test Trial the client interacts with the Controller)?</li> <li>For the loginvalidation: In my test Trial the Controller ask the model, if the login_data (username and pw) are correct. Is it necessary, that the model interacts with an database, where the user data are stored? </li> <li>If i would like to send data in an http Request, should i just add the variable in the brackets?</li> </ol>  <p>Here is my test Trial: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k5fJ5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/k5fJ5.jpg</a></p>
