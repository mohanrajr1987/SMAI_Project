<p>My question is relatively simple: how would I go about implementing a UML sequence diagram in C++ code? I was reading up on sequence diagrams the other day, and I found <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/images/models/sequenceDiagramBasicCourse.jpg" rel="nofollow">this example</a> for a program for a student enrolling in a seminar.</p>  <p>How would I go about turning this diagram into a program? For the sake of this question, lets focus on one class, say the <code>EnrollInSeminar</code> controller. How would I go about implementing this?</p>  <p>I imagine that it might be something like this:</p>  <pre><code>class EnrollInSeminar { public:   void Activate(); };  void EnrollInSeminar::Activate() {   SecurityLogon logonUI{};   Student theStudent = logonUI.getStudent();   SeminarSelector seminarSelectorUI{};   Seminar seminar = seminarSelectorUI.getSeminar();   if (!seminar.isEligible(theStudent))     return;   theStudent.getSchedule().determineFit(seminar);   Fee fee = StudentFees.calculateFees(seminar, theStudent);   FeeDisplay feeUI{fee};   if (!feeUI.getVerification())     return;   seminar.enrollStudent(theStudent); } </code></pre>  <p>Is this the correct way to implement the <code>EnrollInSeminar</code> class? If not, how should I do it?</p>
