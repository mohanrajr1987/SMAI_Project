<p>We are looking for a <strong>.NET diagramming library/component</strong> which will allow us to create complex Entity relation/UML diagrams and export to jpeg/png/bmp images. </p>  <p>"User interaction" with the diagram (dragging shapes and edges, etc) is not a requirement, because we only need to generate UML diagrams "from code" to graphically represent database structure/relations and export these diagrams to images.</p>  <p>Only requirement is that the component is being actively developed and the company offers customer support.   </p>  <p>We are interested in both free and commercial components.  </p>  <p>Can you give us any recommendations based on your experience?</p>
