<p>I am working on a little website. The database was created and we need to create objects from sql now. </p>  <p>Usually, in "Many to many" relation, I use a list to represent this relation. (List of ingredient in recipe, and if I need, a list of recipe in ingredient). But I don't know what is the best way when the junction table contain field.</p>  <p>For example with theses tables:</p>  <pre><code>######            ####################            ########## RECIPE            INGREDIENT_IN_RECIPE            INGREDIENT  id                  id_ingredient                  id  name                id_recipe                      name                      quantity                      other </code></pre>  <p>Is there a best way to create object from this sql? </p>  <p>I don't know if:</p>  <ul> <li>I need to create an third object "IngredientInRecipe". And list it on recipe/ingredient?</li> <li>Maybe create fields quantity/other in ingredient and use it only when I want to handle ingredient as "ingredientinrecipe"?</li> <li>Or create a Subclass of Ingredient with quantity/other?</li> </ul>  <p>Maybe I'm totally wrong and I just have to create list in recipe and use sql query or array for other things but I'm little bit lost.</p>
