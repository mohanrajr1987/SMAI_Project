<p>CONTEXT: I have an abstract class <strong><em>Student</em></strong>. From this class I derive three concrete classes <strong>SchoolStudent, UnderGradStudent</strong>, <strong>PostGradStudent</strong>. I have another class <strong>Vehicle</strong>. A school student must <strong>NOT</strong> drive a vehicle however, an undergrad or a postgrad student <strong>may or may not</strong> drive a vehicle.But every vehicle must be driven by somebody hence the <strong>Vehicle</strong> class has a reference to a student.</p>  <p>PROBLEM: I have association between classes <strong>UnderGradStudent &amp; Vehicle</strong> and another association between <strong>PostGradStudent &amp; Vehicle</strong>. However, I am a little confused about the multiplicity.</p>  <p>As I understand the problem, the UML class diagram should look something like this:<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vJ6va.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vJ6va.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However, I suspect the above diagram suggests that each <strong>Vehicle</strong> will have one <strong>UnderGradStudent</strong> as well as one <strong>PostGradStudent</strong>.</p>  <p>Is the above diagram correct as to what I want to model corresponding to the context?</p>
