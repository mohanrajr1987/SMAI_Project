<p>I have a website in which there is a navigation menu in each HTML page. In order to implement this, there is a JavaScript function that is called and writes the navigation panel with all the links</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!------------------------------------------------------------------------                       HEADER Navigation bar   ------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt; &lt;script&gt;    insertHeader(); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thus, if there is a change, it is done only in the JavaScript file and is automatically applied to dozens of pages across the website.</p>  <p><strong>Problem</strong>: I am trying to generate a sitemap with <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/" rel="nofollow">this tool</a>. However, since my navigation panel is not written in the HTML (but inserted by JS), this tool does not recognize the navigation. As a result 99.9% of my website is not recognized. Other tools I saw also behave similar behavior.</p>  <p>1) How can I overcome this problem?</p>  <p>2) Will google crawlers see the other links I have in navigation panel?</p>
