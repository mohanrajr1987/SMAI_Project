<p>I am using apache nutch 2.3. I have a small cluster of hadoop (1.2.1) of 4 nodes. I am running one instance of cralwer. It daily crawl about 30k-to-50k pages. I have to crawl more pages per day ( supposed value is about 1 million). I have tried different questions from FAQ of nutch. But documents crawled could not increased. I think I should run nutch in fully distributed mode ( I expect full distributed mode of nutch is running more than one instance ).</p>  <p>What should be the solution of my problem. Please discribe it thoroughly as there is not so much documentation found for nutch on web.  </p>
