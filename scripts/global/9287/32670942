<p>I am trying to crawl Google Local's business reviews to pull review information programmatically. I am using Python because once the script is done, it has to be constructed as such to allow it's functions to be imported into a larger Python application.</p>  <p>The input the application can expect will be Google urls like this:</p>  <pre><code>https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=amy%27s+ice+cream&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=0&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;lrd=0x8644b130384298d3:0xad33336b7377c5a6,1&amp;rlfi=hd:;si:12480375528965522854 </code></pre>  <p>As you can see in the above URL, there is a fragment identifier. This is what causes the reviews to be rendered (via Javascript), removing it loads a general search results page. I need to be able to activate this fragment identified programmatically so I can crawl the review content. I am unsure how to do this. I have tried just passing the whole URL, rendering the entire page via web-kit, and then parsing what is rendered, but it seems to be skipping or excluding the fragment identifier. I am not sure how best to proceed. </p>
