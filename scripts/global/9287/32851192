<p>I'm trying to build a search engine that scrapes image links from other websites. I've got a file called crawl.py in the folder of my django app.</p>  <p>when I try running <code>python crawl.py</code>      </p>  <pre><code>SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import </code></pre>  <p>How can I run a script that will use Django, also if someone could elaborate how this is done in development and deplomyent that would be very helpful.</p>
