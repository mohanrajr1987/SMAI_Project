<p>I'm making a web-crawler and I'm trying to figure out a way to find out absolute path from relative path.  I took 2 test sites. One in ROR and 1 made using Pyro CMS. </p>  <p>In the latter one, I found href tags with link "index.php". So, If I'm currently crawling at <code>http://example.com/xyz</code>, then my crawler will append and make it <code>http://example.com/xyz/index.php</code>. But the problem is that, I should be appending to root instead i.e. it should have been <code>http://example.com/index.php</code>. So if I crawl <code>http://example.com/xyz/index.php</code>, I'll find another "index.php" which gets appended again. </p>  <p>While in ROR, if the relative path starts with '/', I could've easily known that it is a root site. </p>  <p>I can handle the case of index.php, but there might be so many rules that I need to take care of if I start doing it manually. I'm sure there's an easier way to get this done. </p>
