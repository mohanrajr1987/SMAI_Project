<p>I'm having issues with figuring out how I can store and scan large amounts of visited URLS from a web crawler. The idea is that the number of visited URL's will eventually be too much to store in memory and I should store them in file but I was wondering, doesn't this become very inefficient? If after getting a batch of URL's and I want to check if the URL is already visited I have to check the visited file line by line and see if there is a match? </p>  <p>I had thought about using a cache but the problem still remains when the URL is not found in the cache and I would still have to check the file. Do I have to check the file line-by-line for every URL and is there a better/more efficient way to do this?</p>
