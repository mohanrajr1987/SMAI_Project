<p>Recently I have been assigned a project at my college, which is a news aggregator. I found Flipboard to be a very interesting and viral app for news aggregation. To achieve this, I am building a web crawler, that  will crawl the websites, to fetch recent news and posts. I was going through a post on <a href="http://www.gizmod.com" rel="nofollow">Gizmod</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Is the scraper universal/generic, or are there customer scrapers for   certain sites? </p>      <p><strong>Doll</strong>: It is mostly universal/generic. However, we can   limit the amount of content displayed on a site-specific basis. We   already try to do this with some sites that publish extremely   abbreviated RSS feeds- even though we aren't using RSS directly, we   attempt to achieve display parity with their feed.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am quite familiar with the process of fetching data from a single website. But not sure how could I fetch the data from multiple websites and blogs, all with a completely different structure.</p>  <p>I am currently using Python 2.7, urllib2 and BeautifulSoup for crawling a single website.</p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>  <p>I want to know, how could I achieve the objective of fetching data from thousands of websites via just one generic crawler?</p>
