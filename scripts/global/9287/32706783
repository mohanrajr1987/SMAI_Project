<p>New in this so i am not sure which tools/software is appropriate for this. Basically what i want to achieve is to get a list of forms together with the attribute of HTML form, action field and method (type, name, value). I have tried "import.io" but somehow it seems that this is only appropriate for retrieving data on a webpage.</p>
