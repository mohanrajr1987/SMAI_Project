<p>I have recently created a webpage using <code>Angularjs</code> and I'm currently trying to get it indexed by Google using <code>pushstate</code>. </p>  <p>I've done quite abit of research and found out that I can use <code>Googlebot-simulater</code> in <code>Google Webmaster tools</code> to simulate a Google-visit on my site, and see how the bots see my webpage vs what the users see. </p>  <p>Here the result looks good, <code>Google</code> sees exactly the same stuff as my users, and all the pages/subpages get the status of either <code>partially</code> or <code>fully</code>.</p>  <p>Another way I've been informed about, this morning, to see what <code>Google</code> sees on my website is by googling <code>site:domainname</code>. Here comes a list of all the pages/subpages <code>Google</code> has <code>cached</code> and by clicking on the different links, you get a view where the respective page is showed.</p>  <p>Here is were I get a little concerned that I missed something, because regardless of the <code>partially</code>/<code>fully</code> status my pages get from the <code>Goolgebot-simulation</code>, when I look at my pages (using the second method), the pages are all blank.</p>  <p>It is my first time indexing webpages, and I have tried for days, but without any luck. Is there somebody that can tell what I'm doind wrong/missin, or at least point in the right direction? Or should I just be a little more patient?</p>
