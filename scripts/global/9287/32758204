<p>I'm new to Nutch and crawling. I have installed Nutch 2.0, crawled and indexed the data using Solr 4.5 by following some basic tutorials. Now I don't want to parse all the text content of a page, I want to customize it like Nutch should crawl the page and scrape/fetch only the data related to address because my use case is to crawl URLs and parse only address info as text.</p>  <p>For example, I need to crawl and parse only the text content which has address information, email id, phone number and fax number.</p>  <ol> <li>How should I do this? Is there any plugin already available for this? </li> <li>If I want to write a customized parser for this can anyone help me in this regards?</li> </ol>
