<p>Trying to get contents from this website using file_get_contents, but it's getting less than half the links, and none of the relevant links. Am I doing something wrong? Before you ask, no, you do not have to be logged in to see the website normally. </p>  <pre><code>$startLink = "http://www.wikihow.com/Special:GoogSearch?cx=008953293426798287586%3Amr-gwotjmbs&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=how+to+dance";  $content = file_get_contents($startLink); echo $content; </code></pre>
