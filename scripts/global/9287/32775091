<p>I'm using a HTML parser in Java and built a simple crawler and it works except that I don't filter any pages, it just grabs any and all links it finds. I wanted to search for particular keywords which I thought should be in the <code>&lt;meta name="keywords"&gt;</code> tags of the pages however I noticed many pages don't have this tag I guess because they don't need it?</p>  <p>I was wondering what other data I can check on a page to compare it's relevance to my keyword list e.g titles - or should I scan the entire html for the keywords each time?</p>
