<p>This is the simple webcrawler I was trying to build</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php      $to_crawl = "http://samplewebsite.com/about.php";      function get_links($url)     {         $input = @file_get_contents($url);         $regexp = " &lt;a\s[^&gt;]*href=(\"??)([^\" &gt;]*?)\\1[^&gt;]*&gt;(.*)&lt;\/a&gt; ";         preg_match_all("/$regexp/siU", $input, $matches);          $l = $matches[2];          foreach ($l as $link) {             echo $link."&lt;/br&gt;";         }     }       get_links($to_crawl);   ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I try to run the script with the $to_crawl variable set to a url ending with a file name, e.g. "facebook.com/about", it works, but for some reason, it just echo's nothing when the link is ending with a '.php' filename. Can someone please help?</p>
