<p>facing a issue here:</p>  <p>Following example:</p>  <pre><code>for item in g_data:         Header = item.find_all("div", {"class": "InnprodInfos"})         print(Header[0].contents[0].text.strip()) </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>DMZ 3rd Tunnel - Korean Demilitarized Zone Day Tour from Seoul Panmunjeom Day Tour Seoul City Half Day Private Tour The Soul of Seoul - Small Group Tour Seoul Helicopter Tour Seoul City Full Day Tour Seoul City Half Day Tour The Street Museum in the Urban Core - Small Group Tour Korean Folk Village Day Tour DMZ 3rd Tunnel - Korean Demilitarized Zone Day Tour from Seoul Panmunjeom Day Tour Seoul City Half Day Private Tour The Soul of Seoul - Small Group Tour Seoul Helicopter Tour Seoul City Full Day Tour Seoul City Half Day Tour The Street Museum in the Urban Core - Small Group Tour Korean Folk Village Day Tour </code></pre>  <p>As you can see above, it gives me the output twice. Hence, only the second duplicates should be removed.</p>  <p>The result should look like:</p>  <pre><code>DMZ 3rd Tunnel - Korean Demilitarized Zone Day Tour from Seoul Panmunjeom Day Tour Seoul City Half Day Private Tour The Soul of Seoul - Small Group Tour Seoul Helicopter Tour Seoul City Full Day Tour Seoul City Half Day Tour The Street Museum in the Urban Core - Small Group Tour Korean Folk Village Day Tour </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone provide me feedback how to delete the duplicates? Any feedback is appreciated.</p>
