<p>I am doing a project using Python for emoji recommendation system. The first step is collecting data from twitter. Specifically, I need tweets using top popular emojis. I am thinking about crawling the website or use the twitter API. But I didn't see anywhere in twitter document about how to search with certain emoji(maybe using its unicode, for example, U+1F602).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
