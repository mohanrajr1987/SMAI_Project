<p>I have some codes that gets all the links of a page, but some were getting links that doesn't look like links. For example, indexes 0-4 was getting links called "javascript:void(0)", and index 5 was getting a blank link with just a "/". How do I fix this? Thanks. </p>  <pre><code>$content = file_get_contents("http://bestspace.co"); //get content of page  $links = "&lt;a\s[^&gt;]*href=(\"??)([^\" &gt;]*?)\\1[^&gt;]*&gt;(.*)&lt;\/a&gt;"; //set regular expression to get links preg_match_all("/$links/siU", $content, $matches); //get all links on page and store in array $matches[2]  print_r($matches[2]); </code></pre>  <p><b> contents of array </b></p>  <pre><code>Array (   [0] =&gt; javascript:void(0)  [1] =&gt; javascript:void(0)  [2] =&gt; javascript:void(0)  [3] =&gt; javascript:void(0)  [4] =&gt; javascript:void(0)  [5] =&gt; /  [6] =&gt; /bestdeals  [7] =&gt; /about-us  [8] =&gt; /why-choose-us  [9] =&gt; /products  [10] =&gt; https://cloud.bestspace.co/clientarea.php   ect... ); </code></pre>
