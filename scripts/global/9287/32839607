<p>I am using the featherlight jquery plugin to display iframes in popovers. </p>  <p>I have this on my parent page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="#" data-featherlight="#pop"&gt;Open iFrame in lightbox&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;iframe class="lightbox" src="product-a.html" id="pop" style="border:none;" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Will google crawl and try and index <code>product-a.html</code>? </p>  <p>I need to stop google or search engines from crawling the iframe content (there will be thousands of these pages across my site and i don't want my crawl budget being used up unnecessarily) and also stop it from being indexed.</p>
