<p>I'm learning how to crawl web pages and for experiment I've tried to crawl some data about footballers from web page. I'm using <code>HtmlUnit</code> framework with <code>WebClient</code> class.</p>  <p>First of all, I have a list of footballer names, and for every record it calls method that creates new <code>WebClient</code> object. </p>  <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>//main() for (String surname : surnames) {    searchForFootballer(surname);   Thread.currentThread().sleep(randomInterval); }  public void searchForFootballer(String surname) {      WebClient webClient = new WebClient();     HtmlPage page = webClient(page);      // do some coding to fetch data from first page     //......       //when done, set thread to sleep before it clicks new page on paginator (still on the same surname)     HtmlAnchor a = someLink;    Thread.currentThread.sleep(randomInterval);    a.click();    //later have defined eventListener that handles what is done on a.click(), isn't important at the moment  } </code></pre>  <p>As I don't want to make hundreds of new webClient object at a time, I put thread to sleep after every record.</p>  <p>As I said, method is creating new webClient object on every call (<code>webpage</code> is specific and it has to be like that), get bunch of result that has pagination (and I don't want to click all links at once to "kill server" so I put that thread to sleep).</p>  <p>So, we have two threads that goes to sleep (mother - creates web clients in a for loop, and child - web client). After some time, if mother sleeps less than client, it generates new webClient and causes me lot of problems because new web client is created before old one has finished.  I would like threads are in order - mother can generate new child thread only when older child finishes, how can I do that?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
