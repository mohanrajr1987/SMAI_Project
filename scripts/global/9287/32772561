<p>I am new to web development. So here is my situation.</p>  <p>I have 1 web page, lets call it X, that performs a query to pull data out. I have a short url redirect page, lets call this Y, that takes the ID and redirects it to page X with the ID to perform the query.</p>  <p>So when I attempt to upload my sitemap to google, it says INVALID URL.</p>  <p>www.domain.com/Y?ID -> www.domain.com/X?ID</p>  <p>The purpose of this is that webpage X is a VERY LONG ugly URL.</p>  <p>I have 10 of these listed with 10 different IDs. I am unsure of what I can do. I read somewhere regarding 301 redirect page, however, I don't fully understand it.</p>  <p>I think I may have the answer but I am unsure if it's correct, but the way I see this working is having TWO sitemaps.</p>  <p>The first sitemap contains www.domain.com/Y and some sub URL that will call the 2nd sitemap which will contain ALL possible entries of www.domain.com/X?ID This way the bot can crawl through the first sitemap and knows that it needs to go to my second sitemap with all the long ugly URLS. Only problem is how would I be able to pass the ID into my redirect page.</p>  <p>If this is all wrong, can someone point me to the right direction?</p>
