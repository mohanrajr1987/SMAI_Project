<p>I'm working on my app, I wanted to add admob banner like I always do without any problem before, but now on this new app it doesn't show up.</p>  <p>The banner ad is in one of the uiTableViewCells, and I get this log message :  -canOpenURL: failed for URL: "kindle://home" - error: "(null)"</p>  <p>I have disabled the Bitcode and I have added the App Transport Security and NSAllowsArbitraryLoads in the info.plist file.</p>
