<p>I have a strange issue here about interface builder. I added some views, buttons to my view controller and they were displayed well in the interface builder some hours before. But now, they disappeared. I mean, they are not displayed in the interface builder while showing up perfectly when running. Below images is the view controller in my interface builder. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DohNW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DohNW.png" alt="Nothing is showing up in the view controller"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YrrMj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YrrMj.png" alt="And the view hierarchy .Items are grey outed"></a></p>  <p>Here is some other view controller in the same project. Items in it are showing normally. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7cSZN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7cSZN.png" alt="Items are showing"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RxCaX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RxCaX.png" alt="Items in view hierarchy. Not grey outed."></a></p>  <p>Could anyone tell me the reason of this ?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> They disappeared after I installed some libraries using cocoapods. Can it be the reason?</p>
