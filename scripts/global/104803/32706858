<p>In my project I had to disable auto-layout and for localization reasons I've removed Launch Image Source assets (replaced with corresponding Defaultxxx images)</p>  <p>I've encountered with glitch in iPhone 6 and 6+ devices (simulators too). All elements on the screen seems to scale by 40%. I'll explain - I have UICollectionView on the main screen. Firstly I had 8 cells in controller and after the modifications I had 6 fully visible and 2 partially. Each cell became bigger with its content.</p>  <p>Such thing happened even with navigationBar. </p>  <p>I've got rid of Defaultxxx images and everything is back to normal, however I wonder if that way is closed now for good?</p>
