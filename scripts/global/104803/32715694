<p>I'm trying to setup a Jenkins job which will allow me to automatically create and upload an .ipa file to Itunes Connect. I'm using Shenzhen for this but it fails and I get the following output:      xcodebuild  build/workspace/Mobile-IOS/AdminPanel/AdminPanel.xcworkspace</p>  <p>** BUILD FAILED **</p>  <p>The following build commands failed:     Check dependencies</p>  <p>(1 failure)</p>  <p>** ARCHIVE FAILED **</p>  <p>The following build commands failed:     Check dependencies</p>  <p>(1 failure)</p>  <p>I use the following command in terminal:</p>  <pre><code>$ ipa build --workspace build/workspace/Mobile-IOS/AdminPanel/AdminPanel.xcworkspace --scheme AdminPanel --config DEBUG </code></pre>  <p>ps: I tried both debug and release configs. </p>
