<p>I was trying to archive my app and do testFlight afterwards. But every time when I tried to archive, this same error message would show up.</p>  <p>I have generated provisioning file and I have added certificate. One thing is that when I clicked on my provisioning file for distribution, Xcode would pop up, and there is no iPhone configuration utility anymore.</p>  <p>Could anyone help me that what I have done wrong or what is missing?</p>  <pre><code> dyld: Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$_DVTITunesConnectProxy   Referenced from: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/Validation   Expected in: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/../../../../../../SharedFrameworks/DVTFoundation.framework/Versions/A/DVTFoundation  in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/Validation Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/Validation failed with exit code 5 </code></pre>
