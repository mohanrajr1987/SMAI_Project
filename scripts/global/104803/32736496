<p>I am presenting a view controller modally in iOS app. The issue is that there is no crash and the app freezes as soon as presentViewController:animated is called. The stats show the CPU usage to be 100% and the usage doesn't go down even after manually closing the app. </p>  <pre><code>UIStoryboard *sb = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Main" bundle:nil]; CustomModalViewController *vvc = [sb instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"CustomModalViewController"]; if(!vvc){     NSLog(@"ERROR!!! vvc is null"); } NSLog(@"instantiate modal view controller");  vvc.providesPresentationContextTransitionStyle = YES; vvc.definesPresentationContext = YES; vvc.data = data; NSLog(@"before presenting modal view controller"); [vvc setModalPresentationStyle:UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext]; [self presentViewController:vvc animated:YES completion:nil]; </code></pre>  <p>I tried printing some debug statements in the viewDidLoad of my custom class, but those are also not getting called. </p>  <p>I don't understand why the view controller is not being displayed. Any help will be appreciated. I want to know in what case does your app go into infinite loop on pushing a view controller or is it because of some other cause??</p>  <p>UPDATE: </p>  <p>This error occured after I updated to XCode 7. Not sure, but I guess this might be an issue with new SDK- the UIKit or LLVM compiler. I copied my project to another mac with Xcode 6.4 and the error disappears!!! I haven't changed any build settings either that would cause the issue. </p>  <p>Any pointers on how to proceed? </p>
