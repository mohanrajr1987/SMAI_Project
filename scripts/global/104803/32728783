<p>I have a simple Xcode project called Quiz (yes, from the Big Nerd Ranch <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming/" rel="nofollow">iOS programming book</a>) Quiz.xcconfig is set as the configuration file for Debug builds. It has one line:</p>  <pre><code>OTHER_LDFLAGS = -force_load /foo/bar </code></pre>  <p>Though it knows Quiz.xcconfig sets <code>OTHER_LDFLAGS</code> Xcode doesn't want to use that setting. A blank space, instead of the value in Quiz.xcconfig, is highlighted in green in the build settings (see the bottom rows labelled "Other Linker Flags"):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rHGq2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rHGq2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Why is this the case? From what I've read, it seems like the resolved setting should be the one from the .xcconfig file. Is there a way to make it so? </p>  <p>I've also found that other settings in the xcconfig do resolve. But not <code>OTHER_LDFLAGS</code>.</p>
