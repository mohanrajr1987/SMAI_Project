<p>I'm trying to show view controller which is 2nd view controller in a navigation view controller. What I want to show RegistraionViewController if join is tapped. Based on that. I push registrationViewController to the navigation Controller where LoginViewController is rootView Controller. Now the issue is when Join is Tapped. It Should show registrationView Controller but it shows Login screen and after a delay of about half second. It shows registration screen. My Code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>           if  let navC = self.selectedViewController as? UINavigationController             {                 if  let vc = navC.viewControllers.first as? LoginViewController                 {                     if let registerVC = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("RegistrationViewControllerIdentifier") as? RegistrationViewController                     {                         var view = navC.view                         vc.navigationController?.pushViewController(registerVC, animated: false)                      }                 }              } </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried by changing the transition of views and giving animation time as 0. But no luck. Which is :</p>  <pre><code>if let registerVC = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("RegistrationViewControllerIdentifier") as? RegistrationViewController {              UIView.animateWithDuration(0.0, animations: {                 if let view = self.navigationController?.view                 {                     self.navigationController?.pushViewController(registerVC, animated: false)                     UIView.setAnimationTransition(UIViewAnimationTransition.None, forView:view , cache: false)                  }                  }, completion: {                     (value: Bool) in             })  } </code></pre>
