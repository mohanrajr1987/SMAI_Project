<p>I'm trying to follow along with the OpenCV tutorial, found <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/user_guide/ug_features2d.html?highlight=surf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Part of the tutorial is to create a SURF feature detector. </p>  <p>Unlike the tutorial, my code is in a header file, like this:</p>  <pre><code>class Img {     Mat mat;     int minHessian = 400;     SurfFeatureDetector detector(minHessian);      public:         ... } </code></pre>  <p>The error I'm getting occurs on the line</p>  <pre><code>SurfFeatureDetector detector(minHessian); </code></pre>  <p>and the error is:</p>  <pre><code>Unknown type name 'minHessian' </code></pre>  <p>When I do not put this in a separate class, the compiler does not complain. I have also checked and I have imported the required libraries.</p>  <p>Can anybody tell me what the error is, and how to fix it?</p>
