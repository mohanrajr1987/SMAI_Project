<p>I'd like to import a folder to Xcode, not just the files it contains. The difference is that if the folder has files added to it later (ie., an update from a remote repository) then these files would automatically show on the project and be included in the build. What Xcode seems to be doing is just importing the <strong>current</strong> files on the directory. Is there a way to do this?</p>
