<p>I posted a similar question yesterday but please bear with me. I am trying to install libraries such as ObjectMapper, Alamofire, etc. using Cocoapods (updated to latest version). I can successfully install the pods but as soon as I open &lt;>.xcworkspace, I get build errors in the library files. I had installed SwiftyJSON a month ago using CocoaPods and it didn't give me a problem at the time. I tried installing SwiftJSON in an entirely new project using CocoaPods and it is giving me the build issues now. Please help! There are no references for this!</p>  <p>My current Cocoapods version is 0.38.2. My project's deployment target is 8.4.</p>  <p>This is my Podfile</p>  <pre><code># Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project # platform :ios, '6.0'  target 'retailcatalogue' do  source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git' platform :ios, '8.0' use_frameworks! pod 'SwiftyJSON'  end  target 'retailcatalogueTests' do  source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git' platform :ios, '8.0' use_frameworks! pod 'SwiftyJSON'  end </code></pre>  <p>My current version of Xcode is Version 6.4 (6E35b). Could that be a factor?</p>
