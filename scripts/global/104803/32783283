<p>I write a sample code</p>  <pre><code>#include "ql/quantlib.hpp" using namespace QuantLib;  int main() {     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>When I compile it on g++, it is easy. Just input "g++ main.cpp -lQuantLib", and it is done.</p>  <p>But when I try to compile it on Xcode, there are lots of problem even if I include "/usr/local/Cellar/quantlib/1.6.1/include" in the search path.</p>
