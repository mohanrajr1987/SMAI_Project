<p>I know that question has been asked many times, but the solutions didn't work with me. I have the following <code>NSManaged</code> object class:</p>  <pre><code>@NSManaged var cellColor: AnyObject @NSManaged var des: String @NSManaged var name: String @NSManaged var switcher: NSNumber </code></pre>  <p>And when trying to assign this value to a var as a bool when loading the managed object, I get an error. This is an example of assigning the value to a var:</p>  <pre><code>func loadData(){ var appDel = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate var context = appDel.managedObjectContext! var request = NSFetchRequest(entityName: "Row") var result:NSArray = context.executeFetchRequest(request, error: nil)! if result.count &gt; 0 {     for i in result{          var name = i.name as String         var des = i.des as String         var color = i.cellColor as UIColor         var switcher:Bool{             get{              return i.switcher == NSNumber(bool: true)              //the problem    happens here </code></pre>  <p>However, when I try a simple example of casting in this way, It works well.</p>  <p>How to solve that ??</p>
