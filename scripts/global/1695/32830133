<p>I have a form for an invoice creation and my task is that I want a user to be able to limit a customer's selection of data from a database based on selections the user has previously made.  </p>  <p>My constraints are that each company has access to all products but the price for the <strong>same</strong> product will be different for different companies.  Also each product may come in different sizes, which will have different prices.</p>  <p>Need help understanding the logic behind creating the connections between these classes.</p>  <p>For instance my entities:<br> <code>Company (attributes: CustID, Name, ShipTo, SoldTo, City, State, ZipCode)</code> </p>  <p><code>Product (attributes: UN, Name, Hazard, Packing Class, Grade, Weight, Unit Type)</code></p>  <p>Now each product can come in many sizes, and each size has many products associated with it. So I created a junction table titled <code>Type</code> with attributes <code>Size</code> and <code>UN</code> and linked in the Product and Type table together.</p>  <p>Then I created another junction because each company could have the same product and each product could be sold to many companies, and titled it <code>CustProduct</code> with attributes <code>CustID</code> and <code>UN</code> and linked it to Product table and Company Table.  </p>  <p>Now I'm getting confused, how and where do I create a relationship that will allow link a unique price to <code>product</code> with a determinable <code>size</code> sold to a specific <code>Company</code>?  Banging my head on this. </p>
