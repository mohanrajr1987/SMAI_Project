<p>Could you please help me understand and solve the following question step by step? </p>  <p>Schemas: STUDENT(Student_Id, SNAME, DEPARTMENT)</p>  <p>COURSE(Course_Id, CNAME, INSTRUCTOR)</p>  <p>Student_Course(Student_Id, Course_Id, GRADE)</p>  <p>(a) Find the names of all students who have taken every course taught by Professor Jacob ? </p>  <p>Answer : 1. Selecting the tuples where instructor="jacob" from table "Course"          2. Projecting the Course_Id          3. Natural Join of Student and Student_Course table.          4. projecting Studen_Id and Course_Id and dividing this by the result<br>             got from step 2  </p>  <p>(b) Find the IDs of all students who have never taken any course taught by Professor Jacob ?</p>  <p>Answer :           1. find students who have taken some course taught by jacob by doing              natural join of all three tables and project Student_Id.          2. Project Student_Id from Student table.          3. Find the difference between the one in step 2 and the one in step 1</p>  <p>(c) Find the IDs of all courses which have never been taken by any student who has taken at least one course taught by Professor Jacob ?</p>  <p>Answer : 1. Natural Join of all three tables and select tuples where<br>             Instructor="jacob"          2. Project Course_Id from the result.          3. Project Course_Id from "Course" table and find the difference              between this and the one from step 2. </p>  <p>(d) Find the IDs of all students who have only taken courses taught by Professor Jacob ?</p>  <p>Answer : 1. select Course_Id from Course table where instructor="jacob"          2. Project Student_id, course_id from student_course table and find the             difference from this and the one from step 1.             Now we have got student_id of those who have also taken courses that              are not taught by "jacob"          3. Project student_id from Student table and find difference between              this and the one in step 2.  </p>  <p>(e) Find the IDs of all courses satisfying following conditions:     (i)they are taught by Professor Jacob and      (ii) all students who have taken the course get a grade C or above</p>  <p>Answer : 1. Fetch course_id of the course taught by jacob from "Course" table.          2. Fetch course_id of the course where grade is greater than "C" from<br>             Student_Course table.          3. Intersection of the results from step 1 and step 2.</p>  <p>This is how I have approached the problem. Is there any other efficient way of doing this ? or Is there anything wrong in my procedure?</p>
