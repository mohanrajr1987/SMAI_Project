<p>I need to add a column [new_date] that I will get from my [date] sql table to an existing table [returns] and create primary keys. This [returns] table already has 65 million records and while I could repopulate all of the data. What is the simplest way of doing this.</p>  <p>My thoughts are to rename the table with a temporary name. Say [returns_old] and then drop and create my new table and assign my primary key's. I think then joining the [returns_old] with my [d_date] as I populate my new table would work.</p>
