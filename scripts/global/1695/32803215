<p>Relatively new to the more advanced areas of database design and would like a second opinion before I go down any path.</p>  <p>I will have users which will need various pieces of information stored about them, username, password, email etc.</p>  <p>Each one of these users will be allowed to save 10 pieces of unique personal information a day, from which they can view through a browser.</p>  <p>The users will be able to see previous entries they have made and all of this data is private to each individual user</p>  <p>I'm not sure the best way to structure the database. I imagine one table for usernames/passwords/emails etc but I'm a bit lost for the best way to manage the rest of the user data. I think one other table to hold all the entries referenced by their username is a bit too simple and a table per user is massive overkill. </p>  <p>Surely there are better ways to manage this? Happy to learn but at the moment my knowledge is that limited I wouldn't know where to begin.</p>
