<p>I am trying to build a 'facebook groups' style application, which contains groups and each group has its own set of settings. </p>  <p>so I created 3 tables:</p>  <pre><code>groups - (id, name..) settings - (id, key) groups_settings - (group_id, setting_id, value) group_id + setting_id are a primary key </code></pre>  <p>and it works fine on single values settings (like min_age, max_age etc..).</p>  <p>but now I am facing a problem when I have a setting key which can have multiple values, for example: "allowed_countries" which is a list of allowed countries a user can join from.</p>  <p>I can't have multiple rows with the same group_id and setting_id, as they are under primary key constraint.</p>  <p>so how would you solve this problem? should I restructure my DB?  </p>
