<p><em>Due to the Nature of the Question , searching for similar questions or articles  is quite difficult because keywords have a wide range of meaning. So if there is a similar question, pardon me.</em></p>  <p><strong>The Problem</strong>. (Simplified)</p>  <p>I have a table of users.<em>(<strong>Table User</strong>)</em></p>  <p>Each user Has his own assets <strong><em>(Table Asset Foreign key to user Id)</em></strong></p>  <p>2 Users can be cooperators. Each user selects the assets  he wants to share with the other. For use in this cooperation a Shared Group Is created containing the assets of user1 and user2  .<strong><em>(Table Group FK CooperationId) (Join Table Asset In group)(Table UserCooperation)</em></strong></p>  <p>And now the tricky part.</p>  <p>In some occasions the user might want to Share <strong>All</strong> of his assets with a user.In order to avoid adding every time a new asset to the group manually we need a solution.</p>  <p><strong>Possible  Approaches.</strong> (ordered by personal preference, with queering performance in mind).</p>  <ol> <li>Having an Extra <strong>Table (All assets of user in group)</strong>. So the query will first check if the user added all his assets in the group and skip querying by each asset id, but instead by userId.</li> <li>Having <strong>2 bool Flags on the Cooperation or Group Table</strong> indicating if one user is sharing all his assets with the other and not a group. The query will first read this and if true it will skip the group logic and will just query by user id.</li> <li>Keep also <strong>2 bool Flags on the sharing Table</strong> but to indicate that upon creation any asset has to be included in the Asset in Group table. So the business logic will handle inserting each new asset on that group. Query logic will not change on this occasion </li> </ol>  <p><strong>Alternate Structure.</strong></p>  <p>Instead of having a shared group for the cooperation, each user will have his own group and join the cooperation with his group. (Although a group has no meaning without a cooperation and the All In Group problem remains the same.)</p>
