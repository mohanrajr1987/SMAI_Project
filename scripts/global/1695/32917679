<p>I am looking for some general information in regards to User Table Design.</p>  <p>I have an old table design for 'users', which I need to update but not breaking the entire site's structure. </p>  <p>Current Table Design</p>  <pre><code>UserID | Email   | FirstName | Last Name | ... 1      | a@a.com | John      | Doe       | ... 2      | b@b.com | Jane      | Doe       | ...  </code></pre>  <p>I need to be able to create "Primary" users, as well as "Assitant" users. </p>  <p>Now I believe I should have a few tables designed:</p>  <ol> <li>Users</li> <li>Accounts</li> <li>Users > Accounts - (Relationships &amp; Permissions) IE: of users > accounts</li> </ol>  <p><code>TableID | UserID | AccountID | PERM  1       | 1      | 1         | 001</code></p>  <p>So I guess my question is. Is there a better way to do this? Specifically if there is a current design being used?</p>  <p>Hope this makes sense. Any direction in this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
