<p>I want to create database structure for my project, but I want to plan it wisely, for less memory treating.</p>  <p>So, I have two tables(Users, Words). Users get some words from my Words table and user can set those words(each word, separately) as "Good" and "Bad". And I must to save all of these words status for each user. </p>  <p>For example: From my Words table I show to user words with ID(5, 54,62, 75), and user set the words(5, 62) as "Good" and the words(54, 75) as "Bad". I need to save the status of these words(separately) for the user.</p>  <p>How must I organize a structure of my DB table, that it'll treat less memory, space on my HDD. As less as it can. </p>  <p>I'll use Parse framework database</p>
