<p>I'm working on a C# application for storing medical (pharmaceutical) products, preparing sale and purchase invoices, etc.</p>  <p>I have a table (using SQL Server) for storing the product details (name, manufacturer, category, etc). </p>  <p>If the store had, as example, Paracetamol (expiry in October 2016). Then a new shipment come to the store with the same product (Paracetamol) but with expiry date (Sep 2017), how could I store the details? should I use 2 table? </p>
