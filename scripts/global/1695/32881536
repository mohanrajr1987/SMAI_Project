<p>I have been playing about with different schemas (haven't touched databases in many years) for the following data but none seem ideal.</p>  <pre><code>    A           B           C           D           E 1   Included    Included    Paid        Disabled    Paid 2   Included    Included    Paid        Disabled    Paid 3   N/A         N/A         N/A         Disabled    Paid 4   Included    Included    N/A         Disabled    Paid 5   N/A         N/A         Included    Disabled    Paid </code></pre>  <p>There are currently, but likely to expand, 5 software add on A-E and again currently 5 devices 1-5 but more to come. The software options are either included, not applicable, paid or disabled (untested).  </p>  <p>I originally had the logic determining which device had what option in related software but there are now multiple sinks that will rely on this information so I would like to store it in the database and allow the other software to just pull the info for a given device type (1-5).</p>
