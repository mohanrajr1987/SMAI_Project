<p>I want to store daily fund data for approximately 2000 funds over 20 years or more. At first I figured I would just create one giant table with one column per fund and one row per date. I ran into trouble trying to create this table and also realise that a table like that would have a lot of NULL values (almost half the values would be NULL).</p>  <p>Is there a more efficient way of structuring the table or database for quickly finding and fetching the data for a specific fund over hundreds (or thousands) of days?</p>  <p>The alternative way I've thought of doing this is with three columns (date, fund_id, fund_value). This however does not seem optimal to me since both the date and fund_id would be duplicated many times over. Having a few million data points just for the date (instead of a few thousand) seems wasteful.</p>  <p>Which is the better option? Or is there a better way to accomplish this?</p>
