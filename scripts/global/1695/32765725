<p>i would like to ask what is a better DB design for a photos app and I would like to know the pros and cons of each design that I list. the first one is that I have the meta table which holds image info. </p>  <pre><code>table_images     id -&gt; int(AI)    slug -&gt; VAR(64)    image_owner -&gt; int()    image_thumb -&gt; VAR(255)    image_orig -&gt; VAR(255)    upload_time -&gt; int    update_time -&gt; int    image_visibility -&gt; tinyint()   photos_meta     meta_id -&gt; int(AI)    img_id -&gt; int    meta_name -&gt; VAR(32)    meta_value -&gt; VAR(64) </code></pre>  <p>the image title and description is being held by the photos_meta table. I need to hear some insights about this DB design. or whether I should move the image_title and description to the table_images as well? and the advantage and disadvantages of this DB design compared with the other one that has the image_title and description in the table_images.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
