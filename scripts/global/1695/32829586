<p>I have one dummy table 'Users', let's call it U, and another table 'DataFromUsers', DU. From time to time i'll save a new record into DU, related to one U, and now we have 2 records pointing to the same user U. It'll come the time when i'll have lots of entries in DU resembling to this condition. </p>  <p>The best approach i can see to solve this problem is always storing it's insertion date, once all i care is the most recent DU from U, and am only keeping the old entries for analytical purposes.</p>  <p>Another way would be having a FK in U pointing straight to the most recent record from DU, but that would create a need to always update two tables, and i don't know whether this is a good idea or not (in matters of maintainability and performance).</p>
