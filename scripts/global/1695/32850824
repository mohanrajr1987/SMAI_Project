<p>Could anyone give me an insight for the need to model <strong>decision time</strong> in temporal databases and specifically how and why decision time differs from <em>valid time</em> and <em>transaction time</em>? What would be the semantics of decision time?</p>  <hr>  <p>For instance, what information would/could the <code>dt_period</code> convey in the  following example which illustrates an employee salary data where range types (PostgreSQL) are used, eg. <code>vt_period</code> instead of two distinct columns such as <code>valid_from</code> and <code>valid_to</code>:</p>  <pre><code>  name   | salary |        vt_period        |       tt_period       | dt_period  ---------+--------+-------------------------+-----------------------+-----------  Okihara |   1000 | [2014-01-01,2014-12-31) | [2014-03-15,infinity) | (!?!??)  Okihara |   1500 | [2014-12-31,infinity)   | [2014-11-05,infinity) | (what should this column mean?) </code></pre>  <p>where</p>  <pre><code>  vt_period = Valid time period   tt_period = Transaction time period         dt_period = Decision time period </code></pre>  <p>from which it may be inferred that Okihara was hired for a salary of $1,000 over the period <code>[2014-01-01, 2014-12-31)</code> as last updated on <code>2014-03-15</code> and still current. On <code>2014-11-05</code> a new entry with a raise to $1,500 was made for the subsequent validity period <code>[2014-12-31,infinity)</code> (as stated by the<code>vt_period</code> column).</p>  <p>What range values could <code>dt_period</code> hold and what would their semantics be?</p>
