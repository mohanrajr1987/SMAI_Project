<p>I'm looking at the example</p>  <pre><code>SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID; </code></pre>  <p>from W3Schools and am wondering how I'm supposed to group the clauses in my mind. From what I understand, every SQL query returns a table, and clauses within the query may themselves return a table. So I think of the whole </p>  <pre><code>Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID </code></pre>  <p>as being a table and I'm returning a sub-table of it by applying <code>SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate</code> to it. Is that the right way to think about things? </p>
