<p>Due to struggling to recall the specifics of a lesson I had a few weeks ago, I'm trying to use a TutorialPoint series to clarify the process of normalisation. In it's page for <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/second-normal-form.htm" rel="nofollow" title="2NF">2NF</a>, it gives the example of:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(        CUST_ID    INT              NOT NULL,        CUST_NAME VARCHAR (20)      NOT NULL,        ORDER_ID   INT              NOT NULL,        ORDER_DETAIL VARCHAR (20)  NOT NULL,        SALE_DATE  DATETIME,        PRIMARY KEY (CUST_ID, ORDER_ID) ); </code></pre>  <p>It states that this is in 1NF, however in it's page for <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/first-normal-form.htm" rel="nofollow" title="1NF">1NF</a> it states that in order to be in 1NF "there are no repeating groups of data". In the 2NF example, there would be repeated groups of data. For example, if a customer orders two items, their name would be repeated. Doesn't this break 1NF and if not why?</p>
