<p>I want people to log their start time and their end time when starting and completing a task. I have two schemas in my mind. </p>  <ul> <li>The first is convenient but may prove limiting in the future (actions are only start and end) + has nullable fields (how bad can that be?)</li> <li>The second might be hard to model in ORM and query for the data</li> </ul>  <p>Does any of the two is an anti-pattern or break normalization rules? All suggestions are welcome. Thanks</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I8eZN.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I8eZN.jpg" alt="Schema 2"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VwwOg.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VwwOg.jpg" alt="Schema 1"></a></p>
