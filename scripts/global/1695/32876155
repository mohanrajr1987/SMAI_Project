<p>I'm storing the results of some simulations in a database. A simulation is uniquely identified by its <code>ExperimentID</code>. Every simulation runs for some number of simulation cycles, incremented via <code>CycleCount</code>. So at Cycle 0, we get some data:</p>  <pre><code>ExperimentID, CycleCount, data1, data2 0,            0,          100,   200 </code></pre>  <p>Then at cycle 1, we get more data:</p>  <pre><code>ExperimentID, CycleCount, data1, data2 0,            0,          100,   200 0,            1,          150,   250 </code></pre>  <p>So, <code>data1</code> and <code>data2</code> are in their own tables to make sure the database is normalized. The composite key here is formed by <code>ExperimentID,CycleCount</code>. Can I use <code>CycleCount</code> to establish a relationship between <code>data1</code> and <code>data2</code> by using it as a foreign key? Is there some other way to do this? </p>
