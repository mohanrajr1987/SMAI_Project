<p>Sorry if this question may be very basic (or even stupid) but I am not very skilled in mySQL. However, I need to create a database for my master thesis so I want to be sure it is the most "elegant" and correct as possible.</p>  <p>I have a dataset with a number of Merger and Acquisition deals with relative information (dealid + 12 columns). I need to add information about the industry of the deal. However, this information comes from 3 different databases that apply to subsets of the M&amp;A: some deals have one classification, some another and some another. </p>  <p>For all I know I have two options: integrate all in the deal table or splitting it in 4 tables (one for the deals and one for each different classification) with 1-1 relations. In the first case I would have a table with more than 50 columns, but the second approach does not look very nice.</p>  <p>Does it one of these approaches make sense? Or is there another way I don't know?</p>  <p>EDIT: right now I have 4 excel tables that I would like to import into mySQL. The main table is the "deal" table: it has the primary key "dealid" and then other columns like "parentname", "targetname", etc. So far, I then have 3 more tables, one for each classification. The primary key is again "dealid", but then every table has specific columns (about 15) since every classification has different features (such as NACE code, NACE code description, industry sector, SIC code etc.). </p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
