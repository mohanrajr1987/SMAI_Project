<p>I have some questions about creating a FAQ support funnel. I will write it in PHP and use a MySQL-server.</p>  <p>I will have a couple of questions setup like this.</p>  <p>Question 1<br> -Question 1.1<br> --Question 1.1.1<br> ---Answer 1.1.1.1<br> --Question 1.1.2<br> ---Answer 1.1.2.1<br> -Question 1.2<br> --Answer 1.2.1<br> Question 2<br> -Question 2.1<br> --Answer 2.1.1<br> Question 3<br> - Answer 3.1  </p>  <p>I think that I will just put all questions and answer in my DB and set a q_id. Then link Question 1 to /?q=1.1 and so on. So when I have $_GET['q'] == "1.1" I will show Question 1.1.1 and 1.1.2.</p>  <p>How do you think I should set up this best?</p>
