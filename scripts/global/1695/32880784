<p>I was building an Application where I need to sync user's phone contacts. Now since a phone contact in user's phonebook have N different fields, such as <code>name</code>, <code>contact</code>, <code>work contact</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>email2</code>, <code>website</code> and various other fields.</p>  <p>Now, lets suppose I (User1) have a friend with name N1 having phone numbers P1 and P2 with emails E1 and E2. Now another user (User2) having the contact of the same user but with different name N2 having phone only P1 and email E1.</p>  <p>Currently I was thinking about the following schema</p>  <pre><code>Contacts --id --phone --email --website --address  UserContacts --userid --contacts(list of contacts) </code></pre>  <p>I need to make sure that the details that User1 has of friend should not be shared with User2, because User1 has P1P2 both and E1E2 both but User2 has only P1E1. Also, the name will be same across all the users, which is obviously not required.</p>  <p>Hence, now I was thinking to dump every contact of every user into the table,ie having duplicates. I'm using mongDB hence I dont mind having duplicates, but still I would like to know that how can I prevent data redundancy thereby also making sure that the information is not shared by the other users.</p>
