<p>I want to know the best solution for reviewing edits of a user that needs to be approved by a admin.</p>  <p>At the moment i have a <code>Users</code> table with the following fields.</p>  <ul> <li>Username</li> <li>Password</li> <li>Created_at</li> <li>Updated_at</li> </ul>  <p>I have a relation table <code>user_profile</code> with the following fields</p>  <ul> <li>User_id</li> <li>Firstname</li> <li>Lastname</li> <li>Street</li> <li>Zip</li> <li>State</li> <li>About_me</li> </ul>  <p>I also have a table <code>pending_user_profile</code> for the approvals</p>  <ul> <li>User_id</li> <li>Firstname</li> <li>Lastname</li> <li>Street</li> <li>Zip</li> <li>State</li> <li>About_me</li> </ul>  <p>At the moment i am checking if there is a user_id in the pending_user_profile table to show the pending data inside the edit screen on the application.</p>  <p>Im checking it like this: <code>PendingUser::where('user_id', $this-&gt;id)-&gt;exists();</code></p>  <p>The pending data is also shown for the admin. (basically im just getting everything inside the pending_user_profile. So the admin knows what users have edited there information.</p>  <p>Im getting the data like this: <code>PendingUser::all();</code></p>  <p><strong>First question:</strong> I'm not sure how this will hold up when i have loads of users. So im trying to find a better solution for this, or want to know that the solution im using now is maybe totally fine and i should not be worried about it at all. Is my approach for checking for pending fields a good approach?</p>  <p><strong>Second question:</strong> When storing the pending fields im not sure how to deal with it. Should i compare all fields before submitting them to the pending fields? this way im just storing the fields that are changed. The downside for this option is that i have to get data from 2 separate tables.</p>  <p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
