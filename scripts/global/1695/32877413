<p>would like to build a database website. were you can search your favorite artist and pull up a bio, music mp3 of them from my collection. Also would like to be able to pull all artist up on that are on a particular label, or any song under a particular label. Here is what i've done so far. Never built a database from the ground up so not sure what this will really look like. Should I keep all my mp3 and bios of the artist in one table also. so many ideas and questions.</p>  <p>Artist Table Table</p>  <pre><code>Artist ID Auto-Gen Start At 1 Integer PK  FirstName VarChar(M)     LastName VarChar(M)  Group VarChar(M)  Era Date </code></pre>  <p>Label Tabel</p>  <pre><code>ArtistId Auto-Gen Start At 1 Integer FK  Label PK VarChar(M) </code></pre>  <p>Album Table</p>  <pre><code>Label Varchar(M) FK  Album VarChar(M) PK  ArtistID Auto-Gen Start At 1 Integer </code></pre>  <p>Song Table</p>  <pre><code>ArtistID AutoGen Starting at 1 Integer Album VarChar(M) FK  Song PK VarChar(M)  Label VarChar(M) </code></pre>
