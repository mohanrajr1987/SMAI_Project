<p>First, some definitions to make sure that the terminology I'm using is clear: </p>  <ol> <li><p><strong>Strong and weak entities and strong/identifying and weak/non-identifying relationships:</strong> In an ERD, a weak/non-identifying relationship is one that connects two strong entities, and is indicated with a dashed line. A strong/identifying relationship is one that connects a strong entity to a weak entity (that is, an entity that contains the primary key [PK] of its related entity as a component of its own component), and is indicated by a solid line. </p>  <p>For example, consider this diagram (borrowed from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16675127/how-to-identify-a-strong-vs-weak-relationship-on-erd">another post</a>):</p></li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wqj4M.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wqj4M.png" alt="sample ERD"></a></p>  <p>The relationship between Course (strong entity) and Class (weak entity) is a strong relationship (solid line) because Class contains Course's PK (*CID) as part of its own PK (*CID,*Date). In contrast, the relationship between Room (strong entity) and Class (even though it is a weak entity) is weak because Room's PK (*RID) is not part of Class's PK.</p>  <ol start="2"> <li><strong>Unary/recursive relationship:</strong> Most relationships are binary, in that they connect two separate entities. For example, the relationships between Course and Class, and between Room and Class, are binary relationships. Rarely, you have a unary (also called recursive) relationship when an entity has a relationship with itself. In the diagram, the only unary relationship is the one with the Employee entity. It should be labelled "manages", because it represents the fact that one Employee might manage 0 to many Employees; and every Employee is managed by 1 and only 1 Employee. The PK of Employee is *EmpID, and the foreign key (FK) that links the relationship is Manager.</li> </ol>  <p>So, here's my question: Is a unary relationship strong/identifying or weak/non-identifying? The PK of the one side (Employee, *EmpID) is not only part of, but is the full constituent of the PK on the many side (again, Employee, *EmpID). So, that would indicate that it should be a strong relationship, with a solid line, contrary to what is depicted in the sample diagram. Could anyone please clarify this for me?</p>
