<p>I'm working on an app for our office and before I start writing this part of the app I need to get some ideas on the best way to structure my data. The application will allow the sales team to enter an estimate and provide it to the customer. If the customer accepts the estimate it becomes a job and is scheduled for the appropriate day. I need a structure that allows me to historically see the estimate in its original state but allow for change orders once the estimate becomes a job. At the completion of the job I will need to see the entire job including all change orders. </p>  <p>I have thought about having an estimates table, an estimates details table and then, once the estimate is turned into a job, the record is copied to the job table, job details table and then a change order table...? This doesn't seem very efficient to me.</p>  <p>Can someone please help shed some design light on this for me please?</p>
