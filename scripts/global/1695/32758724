<p>I am having 2 tables:</p>  <p><strong>Student Master</strong>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Id,Firstname,Lastname,email,Phone   no,Countryid,stateid,cityid,Profilepicurl,gender,Dateofbirth.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>CoachMaster</strong>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Id,Firstname,Lastname,email,Phone   no,Countryid,stateid,cityid,Profilepicurl,gender,Dateofbirth,Language.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now you might notice that this 2 tables are having common fields only except 1 extra field i.e <strong>Language</strong> in <strong>coachmaster</strong>.</p>  <p>I am thinking to make a single table which comprises of all fields from both the table i.e this <strong>UserMaster</strong>(contains both StudentMaster and CoachMaster) like this:</p>  <p><strong>UserMaster</strong>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Id,rest all common fields,Language(from Coach Master)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have discuss this with <strong>one of my friend who is an experienced developer</strong> and what he told me to create seperate table only and he has shown me 2 below 2 scenarios for creating <strong>2 seperate tables</strong>:</p>  <ol> <li><p>If i am having 1 common table only that is UserMaster and if in future i want to add 2 extra fields in coach master then this structure would be bad.</p></li> <li><p>If i am adding those 2 extra fields needed for coach in UserMaster and if i just want any specific student details then those 2 extra fields(added in my 1st point for coach) will be unneccessarily fetched too.</p></li> </ol>  <p><strong>Note</strong>:Other Scenarios might exist too with having only 1 table maintaining both coach and student details.</p>  <p>Apart from this what my friend told me that i am not following normalization rule here and if i am having <strong>one single table only that is usermaster</strong> only then for identifying which user is student and <strong>which user is tutor i would always have to use join that is check is</strong> <strong>Userinrole</strong> table which i will maintain like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Role Master:Id,Name(Value:Student,Coach)</p>      <p>UserInRole:RoleId(Reference to RoleMaster Id),UserId(store either   Studentid or CoachId)</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is how i would always have to find whether it is coach r student when i would be having any <strong>id</strong>.</p>  <p>So can anybody help guide me regarding how to create a good structure which will solve that 2 scenarios and avoid unneccessary creation of duplicate fields in both this table??</p>
