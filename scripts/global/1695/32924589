<p>Actually i am desingning a database where suppose a user if following some celebrities now i have made two tables for that one named as user_follow where i am placing user and corresponding to that i am having celebrities he/she is following in an array (e.g "user_name": "mak", "follows": ["Tom_cruise", "Brad_pitt"])and the second table name is celebrity_followers where i am putting celebrities corresponding to the array of user names who are following the celebrity (e.g  celeb_name : "Tom_cruise", "folowers": ["mak", "user2"]) now if i have any update for say tom_cruise i will go into celebrity_followers and corresponding to that celeb and i will send updates to every user named in the array for Tom_cruise now if any user wants to unfollow any celebrity i will go inside user_follow table and i will delete the celeb name corresponding to that user now my question is that for any user he will follow at max 100 celebs so i can easily have 500 elements inside an array in mongoDB but my question is that for any particular celeb i can have 100000 of users now to have them inside an array will that cause any trouble in performance for e.g (when user unfollow delete them from celeb table or to send updates for any celeb)or storing or in any possible way ??</p>  <p>Thank You in Advance</p>
