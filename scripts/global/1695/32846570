<p>Let's assume I have books and reviews and I also have comments which can be related to books or reviews, but not to both of them at the same time, how should I design my DB then? I figured I can do it this way, but then comments can be related to both books and reviews...:</p>  <pre><code>class Book(models.Model):     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)  class Review(models.Model):     review = models.TextField()  class Comment(models.Model):     book = models.ForeignKey(null=True)     review = models.ForeignKey(null=True) </code></pre>
