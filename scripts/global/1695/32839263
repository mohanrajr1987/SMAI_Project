<p>I want to create a database to store process cycle time data. For example:</p>  <p>Say a particular process for a certain product, say welding, theoretically takes about 10 seconds to do (the process cycle time). Due to various issues, the machine's actual cycle time would vary throughout the day. I would like to store the machine's actual cycle time throughout the day and analyze it over time (days, weeks, months). How would i go about designing the database for this? </p>  <p>I considered using a time series database, but i figured it isn't suitable - cycle time data has a start time and an end time - basically i'm measuring time performance over time - if this even makes sense. At the same time, I was also worried that using relational database to store and then display/analyze time related data is inefficient. </p>  <p>Any thoughts on a good database structure would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if any more info is needed and i will gladly edit this question</p>
