<p>I am developing an application with Spring MVC and hibernate where certain forms can be configured dynamically by admin.</p>  <p>For e.g. by default User will have attributes like firstname, lastname, email. But admin can add more fields like birthdate, address, anniversary.</p>  <p>For that I have decided to use form builder approach.</p>  <p>How do I design database for such system?</p>  <p>One approach I have decided is: <a href="http://goo.gl/sMVuWl" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/sMVuWl</a></p>  <p>But here also it is not clear, how to store data for newly created fields.</p>  <p>Do let me know if you need more info.</p>  <p>I am using Spring MVC + hibernate and back end is MySQL</p>
