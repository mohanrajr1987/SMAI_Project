<p>I have a list of floats: </p>  <pre><code>inputlist = [4.1, 8.2, 2.1, 8.1, 3.1]  </code></pre>  <p>I need it to be:</p>  <pre><code>list_sorted = [8.1, 8.2, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1] </code></pre>  <p>by firstly writing floats whose int(number) are the same (int(8.1) == int(8.2)), in ascending order, and then remaining elements, also in ascending order.</p>  <p>Another example:</p>  <pre><code>inputlist = [9.3, 4.1, 4.2, 9.4, 8.2, 7.1] list_sorted = [4.1, 4.2, 9.3, 9.4, 7.1, 8.2] </code></pre>
