<p>I'm trying to sort my arrays of combinations i currently have. It is multidimensional array, but I only need to sort out the array that's inside for now. </p>  <pre><code>for combination in myCombinations {         combination.sort({$0 &lt; $1})         print("\(combination)")     } </code></pre>  <p>Here's my code to sort out the array and here's my result.</p>  <pre><code>["lys", "dyt", "lrt"] ["lys", "dyt", "gbc"] ["lys", "dyt", "lbc"] </code></pre>  <p>I also got a warning that says "Result of call to 'sort' is unused" Could anyone help me out with this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
