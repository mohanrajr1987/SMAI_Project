<p>Reading <a href="http://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/hw_performance/" rel="nofollow">the article</a> about PosgtreSQL effective settings, I came across the <code>cache size</code> and <code>sort size</code> concepts. As there said, these two sizes don't depend on each other.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Both cache size and sort size affect memory usage, so you cannot   maximize one without affecting the other</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.google.ru/?gws_rd=ssl#newwindow=1&amp;q=sort%20size%20postgresql" rel="nofollow">Googling</a> didn't get too much useful results. As far as I got, the cache size can be viewed with </p>  <pre><code>SELECT current_setting('shared_buffers') AS shared_buffers </code></pre>  <p>This returns the size of shared buffers (i.e. cache). But what is the sort size?</p>
