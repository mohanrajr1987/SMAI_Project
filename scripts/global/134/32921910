<p>So the question I have is very similar to this one <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32663989/how-do-you-sort-two-arrays-exactly-the-same">How do you sort two arrays exactly the same?</a>, except instead of having an array I use pointers. At the time of sorting, I do know the amount of elements in the arrays. </p>  <p>Basically, I just want an option that's better than copying everything from my pointer-array into a new array simply so I can use the solutions in the above thread, because that feels like a hackfix rather than a proper solution. Perhaps it's possible to make an array with a fixed size from the pointer without having to copy all the elements?</p>
