<p>The following code sorts through a dictionary of words in lexicographical order. The problem is that I cannot access the sorted array outside of the for loop. Well I think this is the problem. I have declared the array words in another method and returned it to a private variable within the same class. But after I sort the array and try to print it out, it just prints out the original array. I also want to mention that this sorting method does work as I have tested it in another class where everything was in the main method. So again I believe my problem has to do with returning the new sorted array. I also need to write a few lines of code within the method after the array is sorted and when I tried to return the array, using "return words;" I was unable to write this code.</p>  <pre><code>public void insertionSort() { int in, out;  for (out=1; out&lt;nElems; out++){     String temp = words[out];                               // remove marked item     in = out;                                               // start shifting at out                      while (in&gt;0 &amp;&amp; words[in-1].compareTo(temp)&gt;0){          // until temp is lexicographically after after the word it is being compared to         words[in] = words[in-1];                            // shifts word to next position in lexicographical order         --in;                                                        }     words[in] = temp; } for(int i=0; i &lt;words.length; i++)     System.out.println(words[i]); </code></pre>
