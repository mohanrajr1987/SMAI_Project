<p>Consider the following expanded object:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wRnp0.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wRnp0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now each of these objects is stored into an array and its easy to sort by name, email, created_at or what ever else. But what about if I wanted to sore by the users profile investor type. In the image you would do: <code>data.profile.data.investor_type</code> to get the investor type. </p>  <p>How do I use underscore to sort an array of these objects by nested attributes in the object?</p>
