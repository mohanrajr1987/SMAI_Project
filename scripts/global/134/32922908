<p>I have a sortable div (<code>#sortable</code>) with elements (<code>.draggable</code>) inside it. In there, when I sort elements from bottom to up, the elements can easily be sorted by dragging up and I don't have to drag much to the top. But when sorting elements from up to bottom, I have to drag the element far below then wanted. Is there any way to control the sorting of elements?</p>  <p>Demo at <a href="http://codepen.io/aamus/pen/qOrpEZ?editors=001" rel="nofollow">codepen</a>.</p>  <p>js</p>  <pre><code>  $('#content #sortable').sortable({     handle: '.drag_handle',     placeholder: "ui-state-highlight",     axis: "y"   });    $('#blocks .draggable').draggable({     helper: "clone",     revert: "invalid",     connectToSortable: '#content #sortable'   }); </code></pre>
