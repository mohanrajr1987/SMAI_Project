<p>I'm working on an API where I'm getting a <code>JSONArray</code> in which there reside numerous <code>JSONobjects</code> containing around 10 <code>KeyValue</code> pairs. One of them is <code>date: 10-3-2015</code>. I want to use this <code>JSONArray</code> in a sorted manner according to the date value. I've tried a various ways including <code>TreeMap</code> but no success yet.</p>  <p>A short piece of code or a thorough idea will do the work for me. Thanks.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/D96oT.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/D96oT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
