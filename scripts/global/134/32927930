<p>This is what I have so far... How do I get past having my countone go out of the list and crash the program? Or is there a cleaner way? Also, should I be using range or just having for i in list1? Also is there a way of setting i to have an initial value like in java? Edit: Forgot to mention that I'm practicing for interviews... Probably should avoid using built in functions... Or would this be acceptable?</p>  <pre><code>list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] list3 = [] countone = 0  for i in range(0, len(list1)-1):     firstnum = list1[i+countone]     secondnum = list1[i+countone+1]     print firstnum, "+", secondnum     sumnum = firstnum + secondnum     list3.append(sumnum)     countone += 1  print list3 </code></pre>
