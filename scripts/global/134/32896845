<p>I have managed to create an algorithm to check the rank of a poker hand. It works 100% correctly, but it's very slow. I've been analysing the code, and the check straight function is one of the slowest parts of it. </p>  <p>So my question is, is there a better way of calculating whether a hand make a straight?</p>  <p>Here is some details: </p>  <p>7 cards, 2 from holder, 5 from board. A can be high or low. </p>  <p>Each card is assigned a value:      2 = 2     3 = 3     ..     9 = 9     T = 10     J = 11     Q = 12     K = 13     A = 14</p>  <p>The script has an array of all 7 cards:</p>  <pre><code>$cards = array(12,5,6,7,4,11,3); </code></pre>  <p>So now I need to be able to sort this into an array where it:</p>  <ul> <li>discards duplicates</li> <li>orders the card from lowest to highest</li> <li>only returns 5 consecutive cards I.e. (3,4,5,6,7)</li> </ul>  <p>It needs to be fast; loops and iterations are very costly. This is what I currently use and when it tries to analyse say 15000 hands, it takes its toll on the script.</p>  <p>For the above, I used:</p>  <ul> <li>discard duplicates (use array_unique)</li> <li>order cards from lowest to highest (use sort())</li> <li>only return 5 consecutive cards (use a for loop to check the values of cards)</li> </ul>  <p>Does anyone have any examples of how I could improve on this? Maybe even in another language that I could perhaps look at and see how it's done?</p>
