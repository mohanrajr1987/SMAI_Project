<p>I am very new to Java and would appreciate your help very much regarding implementation of modified merge sort algorithm in Java. The aim is to stop dividing array till its length is &lt;=3 (but not reaching length of 1 integer like in real mergesort) and then sort these subarrays using insertion method. Once subarrays are sorted by insertion method then they should be merged using merge sort algorithm. Any ideas how to implement such code? </p>
