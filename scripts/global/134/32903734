<p>I've got a database with a column that contains the following data:</p>  <pre><code>aaa-1 aaa-2 aaa-3 ... aaa-10 aaa-11 ... aaa-100 aaa-101 ... aaa-1000 </code></pre>  <p>When I query and sort the data in ascending order, I get:</p>  <pre><code>aaa-1 aaa-10 aaa-11 ... aaa-100 aaa-101 ... aaa-1000 ... aaa-2 ... aaa-3 </code></pre>  <p>Is this actually the correct (machine) way of sorting? Is the order being screwed up because of the <code>aaa-</code> prefix? How do I go about sorting this the way a human would (ie something that looks like the first snippet)?</p>  <p>P.S. If the problem does lie in the prefix, is there a way to remove it and sort with just the numeric component?</p>  <p>P.P.S. It's been suggested to me that I should just change my data and add leading zeroes like <code>aaa-0001</code> and <code>aaa-0002</code>, etc. However, I'm loathe to go that method as each time the list goes up an order of 10, I'd have to reformat this column.</p>  <p>Thank you all in advance! :)</p>
