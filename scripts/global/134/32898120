<p>I am trying to sort two int arrays into a new int array in ascending order.  </p>  <p>I wrote it like this and it sorted everything but the last element in textArr and I couldn't figure out why...</p>  <pre><code>int i=0, j=0, k=0; while(i &lt; textArr.length &amp;&amp; j &lt; binaryArr.length) {     if(textArr[i] &lt; binaryArr[j]) {         mergeArr[k] = textArr[i];         i++;     }     else {         mergeArr[k] = binaryArr[j];         j++;     }     k++; } </code></pre>  <p><strong>I looked around and found a solution that added two new while loops but I honestly do not know what those second two while loops are doing.  I'd also like to know if this is the most efficient way to sort two arrays into a third sorted array?</strong>  Thanks for any help, I'm very new to java and would like to learn correctly and obviously I want to learn what I'm actually writing too!</p>  <pre><code>int i=0, j=0, k=0; while(i &lt; textArr.length &amp;&amp; j &lt; binaryArr.length) {     if(textArr[i] &lt; binaryArr[j]) {         mergeArr[k] = textArr[i];         i++;     }     else {         mergeArr[k] = binaryArr[j];         j++;     }     k++; } while(i &lt; textArr.length) {     mergeArr[k] = textArr[i];     i++;     k++; }        </code></pre>
