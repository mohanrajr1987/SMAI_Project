<p>I have a file named index.php, which in I include another file named file1.php (in index.php I include all necessary files for jQuery, js etc.). In file1.php I have a table with buttons which each opens a modal. the information in the modal is from an ajax call for file2.php. in file2.php I create a table. In the table I have the cell : </p>  <pre><code>&lt;button class='btn btn-default tooltip-default' data-toggle='tooltip' data-trigger='hover' data-placement='top' data-content='content' data-original-title='Twitter Bootstrap Popover'&gt;AAA&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and, well, the tooltip doesn't work. but, when I copy this  and get it to file1.php, bellow the table, the tooltip does work.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me fix the tooltip ? Thx.</p>
