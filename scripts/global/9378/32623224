<p>I have added android tool tips in project using <a href="https://github.com/sephiroth74/android-target-tooltip" rel="nofollow">source</a> for interactive tutorial. The problem I am facing is that when I turn on the Talk Back or Accessibility feature, the text in tool tip is not read by android talk back feature. </p>  <p>Is there any way I can force accessibility to read text?</p>
