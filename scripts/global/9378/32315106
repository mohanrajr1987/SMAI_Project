<p>Angular bootstrap popover (tooltip) has possible events to open hide popover. { 'mouseEnter': 'mouseLeave', 'click': 'click', 'focus': 'blur' }</p>  <p>What i need is show on 'focus' hide on 'blur'. But i deal with DIV element not an INPUT, so i can't use focus/blur (it just doesn't work)</p>  <p>How can i override tooltip/popover modules to emulate blur event (by handling click on body etc.)?</p>
