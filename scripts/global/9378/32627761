<p>After some browsing I found a code which does what I'd like up to a degree. I'm able to mouse over some text and have a tooltip box appear which contains HTML so it can have images, links, etc in it.</p>  <p>I had it working perfectly and easily in jQuery. The problem is, it's for an eBay description and jQuery won't load on the site, thus it's broken. Which means I have to do it in CSS.</p>  <p>Below is my code - it works with the problem that the box appears when you mouse over where it is, not just when you mouse over the text when you want it to appear - also the cursor has stopped changing to the help symbol for some reason.</p>  <p>I've built a JSFiddle as it seems to make sense for this (though the help cursor does work here, so that must be something else in my longer code)</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/t19vkd5k/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/t19vkd5k/</a></p>  <pre><code>.tiptext {     width: auto;     font-family: 'ProximaNova', Helvetica;     font-weight: bold;     text-decoration: underline;     font-size: 14px;     /*line-height: 175%;*/     color: rgb(39, 44, 45);     cursor: help !important;     position: relative; }  .description {     border:1px solid #e3e3e3;     background: white;     width:auto;     max-width:275px;     height:auto;     padding:10px;     font-family: 'ProximaNova', Helvetica;     font-weight: 200;     color: rgb(39, 44, 45);     font-size: 13px;     top:29px;     left: 120px;     z-index:500;     opacity:0;     /*visibility:hidden;*/     position:absolute;     -webkit-transition: opacity 0.9s ease-out;     -moz-transition: opacity 0.9s ease-out;     -ms-transition: opacity 0.9s ease-out;     -o-transition: opacity 0.9s ease-out;     transition: visibility 0s 2s, opacity 2s linear; }  .tiptext:hover .description { /* display tooltip on hover */     opacity:1;     -webkit-transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in;     -moz-transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in;     -ms-transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in;     -o-transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in;     transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in; } </code></pre>  <p>HTML</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="tiptext"&gt;Hover over me&lt;div class="description" style="text-align:center;"&gt;and this box appears with full html support like links to  &lt;a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;the problem is, this box also appears when you mouse over where it would be.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
