<p>There is command In the AutoHotKey that shows tooltip with some message on the top of the screen. I want to do it on python. </p>  <p>In more details I need to make an application, that will work in background, always tracking a keyboard. On the specific hotkey it should show on the top of the screen a message without grabbing focus from other application. And it should remove this message after some conditions (e.g. mouse moving). It should work with full screen apps too. </p>  <p>I couldn't find how to do it on python, or what libraries should I use. Need your help.</p>
