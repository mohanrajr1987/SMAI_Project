<p>I have a ui-select-match element, and when opening the element and hovering (highlighting) over a row I need a tooltip to show the full content of the row in case of text overflow that is cut off by the border.</p>  <p>It seems like something that should have been a feature of ui-select but I couldn't find any reference for such a thing. So far I only found solutions that show the entire text inside the row.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
