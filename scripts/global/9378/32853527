<p>Linkedin launched a nice feature today in their inbox with a tooltip tutorial that pops up, "Hi [NAME], we've moved things around a bit. Your messages are now organized by the people you are talking to. Sent, received and archived messages are all in one place."</p>  <p>There are 3 steps and the tooltip moves around the screen.</p>  <p>Anyone know if there are libraries for this? We're using React.JS on the frontend.</p>
