<p>I am using Foundation 5 with AngularJS in my project. I have the following use case:</p>  <ol> <li>Click on a 'div' which is inside an ng-repeat.</li> <li>Fetch a list specific to that div in response to the click.</li> <li>Show that list in an ng-repeat in a tooltip/popover of that div(which was clicked).</li> </ol>  <p><strong>How do I go about generating that tooltip?</strong></p>  <p>I tried:</p>  <ol> <li><a href="https://github.com/720kb/angular-tooltips" rel="nofollow">this library</a> but I encountered some issues as mentioned in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32842839/angularjs-tooltip-tooltip-html-template-not-updating?noredirect=1#comment53520604_32842839">question.</a></li> <li><a href="http://pineconellc.github.io/angular-foundation/" rel="nofollow">angular-foundation</a>, but the popovers here don't have a popover-template functionality(like in ui.bootstrap).</li> </ol>  <p>AND I don't want to use ui.bootstrap because I am using Foundation 5 (Its a bad idea, right?).</p>
