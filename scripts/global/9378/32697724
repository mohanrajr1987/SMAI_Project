<p>I have a page that contains multiple graphs made ​​with NVD- chart.js . the graphs are placed in a dashboard , so each part of the dashboard contains a graph. This dashboard contains two line charts. The problem is that the tooltip of the second line-chart is badly placed in the left, so it's far from its line-chart.I tried to use this code to change the position of the tooltip by changing his container but there is no change:</p>  <pre><code>chart.interactiveLayer.tooltip.chartContainer(d3.select('#chart_ligne svg')); </code></pre>  <p>Any one have an idea how to use chartContainer ?</p>
