<p>So, I have that WordPress website on which I installed a template (Zoo). My problem is that I want the whole site to be in French, and there are three buttons in that template which <code>title</code> tag is coded deep in a js file that is inside a plugin which has been integrated to the template.</p>  <p>These are my first steps as a web developer (I come from C++) and I'm having quite a hard time understanding what is missing in the files, but I understood a few things by looking around.</p>  <p>So I made a child theme. This is the functions.php file. I think it works fine, but here it is in case I am doing it wrong :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php function removethosedamntooltips(){     wp_register_script('removetooltips', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/js/removetooltips.js');     wp_enqueue_script( 'removetooltips' ); } add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'removethosedamntooltips'); </code></pre>  <p>This is the aforementioned removetooltips.js file. I believe I have to call for a button hover because the template is single-page parallax and the buttons I want to modify are not visible until you click another button which allows for another display without sending the browser to another URL (if I remove line 2 and the closing brackets that go with it, it doesn't work anyway). Also, those tooltips appear only on mouse hover, so it seems a good idea :</p>  <pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function(){   alert("jQuery!!");   jQuery("button").hover(function(){     alert("jQuery!!");     jQuery(".mfp-arrow-left").attr("title", "Précédent (flèche gauche)");     jQuery(".mfp-arrow-right").attr("title", "Suivant (flèche droite)");     jQuery(".mfp-close").attr("title", "Fermer (Esc)");   }); }); </code></pre>  <p>The first alert displays after the page is loaded, but the second one does not show up. The tooltips (button title) still show up in English.</p>  <p>A piece of information that might be useful to solve this problem (I'm only 2 days into reading stuff about JavaScript and jQuery so I don't really know): I had to use <code>jQuery</code> instead of <code>$</code> or the console would tell me that <code>$</code> is an unknown function. Do I need to somehow include the jQuery framework in my file (if so, where and how ?), although a calling for the jQuery library already shows up in the header ?</p>  <p>If you provide a solution that will remove the tooltips instead of replacing their content, I will be happy enough.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance !</p>
