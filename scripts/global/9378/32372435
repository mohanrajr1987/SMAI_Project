<p>Here is an example of the code:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;p&gt;Bob's &lt;dfn title="Dog"&gt;canine&lt;/dfn&gt; mother and &lt;dfn title="Horse"&gt;equine&lt;/dfn&gt; father sat him down and carefully explained that he was an &lt;dfn title="A mutation that combines two or more sets of chromosomes from different species"&gt;allopolyploid&lt;/dfn&gt; organism.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>How do I make it so if a user hovers the mouse over <em>canine,</em> <em>equine</em>, or <em>allopolyploid</em>, the title which I put using dfn title can then be displayed to the user so he knows what each of those more difficult words mean?</p>
