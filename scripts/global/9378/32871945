<p>I am currently working on a <strong><em>WPF</em></strong> application using <strong><em>C#</em></strong>. What I would like to do is that after I show a pushpin or an image on the map, a text or a tooltip is always shown on top of the pushpin/image, instead of hovering over it first. Is this possible?</p>
