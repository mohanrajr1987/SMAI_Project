<p>TL;DR: How can I create the text for hover-over tooltips on google maps on the fly just as they are hovered-over?</p>  <p>More detail:</p>  <p>I'm making google maps markers in (what I think is) the usual way:</p>  <pre><code>var mar = new google.maps.Marker({   position:loca.loc,   map:map,   title:formatTitle(data[i]),   icon:"i/"+returnColors(loca.lang)+"_"+"10.png" });  </code></pre>  <p>But I'm stuck because my map is in more than one language, so I want to display the tooltip in language A or language B based on a setting in the page.  I've been able to configure all my other stuff (for example, InfoWindows, etc) by simply setting callbacks and at the moment when the display is called, I see which langauge we're using and I show the appropriate text.</p>  <p>The thing is that I want my hover-over tooltips (titles) to be in either langauge too.  Nevertheless, I haven't figured out what callback (if any) is getting triggered when a tooltip gets displayed.  As I've written the code above, the marker gets created when the map loads and the tooltip along with it.  I want some way to generate the tooltip/title on the fly as the hover-over occurs.</p>  <p>Thanks for any tips!</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>One commenter downvoted the question without knowing the answer so that seems a little weird and made me think that perhaps I'm not being specific enough.</p>  <p>Some event fires in the browser code to indicate that it's time to display the tooltip at such-and-such coordinates.  I want to override that event, if necessary.</p>  <p>Clearly there's some code somewhere which dislays that text, I want to find that code and potentially override it.</p>  <p>Hopefully that helps clarify what I'm asking.  I don't need it to be a method in the google.maps.* class hierarchy, I just need to be able to display the text dynamically.</p>  <p>Perhaps some other hover-over/tooltip is the way to go, I've done this some years ago with CSS pseudo-classes but surely there's some modern approach someone can recommend.</p>
