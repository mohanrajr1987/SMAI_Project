<p>I'm currently adding tooltips to some parts of an application and I'm struggling with contextual tooltips on treeviews.</p>  <p>I have set the TreeView to accept tooltips, added a tooltip handler on the QueryTooltip event.</p>  <p>The QueryTooltip handler grabs the row under the mouse using <code>TreeView.GetPathAtPos</code>, which works fine, I set the text that I want (currently, the column value), this is also working correctly.</p>  <p>But, when I try to set the position of the tooltip (I want it above the cell, just like many softwares do), the tooltip stays under the mouse (bottom right).</p>  <p>These are the things I tried :</p>  <pre><code>1 - tooltip.TipArea = treeview.GetCellArea(path, column); 2 - tooltip.TipArea = new Rectangle(0, 0, cell.Width, cell.Height); 3 - SetTooltipCell(tooltip, path, column, renderer); </code></pre>  <p>The documentation on the Tooltip class (not Tooltips, which is obsolete) and its interaction with other widgets are not really documented so any help would be appreciated.</p>
