<p>I am wondering if it's possible to display text that is already in the data-content attribute within an a tag without hover? </p>  <p>I have text in a tooltip that I need to output on mobile without the hover effect so that users can see it. The problem is it is built in already in a parent theme and on mobile, the text inside the tooltip does not display.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="#" class="tooltips" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="right" data-content="My text that I want to display on mobile" data-original-title="" title=""&gt;     &lt;img src="image"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>For reference as to what I mean, see this link: <a href="http://vaughansnowremoval.ca/cart/" rel="nofollow">Link to tooltip icons</a></p>
