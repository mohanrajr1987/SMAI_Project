<p>I am reading from a text file that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P </code></pre>  <p>I will be storing this into a 4x4 char array. My problem is that whenever I am reading from the file it counts the space in between the letters causing it to store the space in the char array. How can i read the line without the spaces? Here is what i have got:</p>  <pre><code>char[][] letters = new char[4][4] Scanner read = new Scanner(new File("letters.txt")); while(read.hasNextLine()) {     for(int row = 0; row &lt; letters.length; row++) {         String line = read.nextLine();         for(int col = 0; col &lt; letters[row].length; col++) {             letters[row][col] = line.charAt(col);         }     } } </code></pre>
