<p>I try to write a character vector to a textfile under Windows 7 / R 3.2.2 x64, and I want unix LF - not Windows CRLF:</p>  <pre><code>v &lt;- c("a","b","c") cat(nl,file="textfile.txt",sep="\n") </code></pre>  <p>writes</p>  <pre><code>&gt; a[CRLF]  &gt; b[CRLF]  &gt; c[CRLF] </code></pre>  <hr>  <pre><code>cat(paste(nl,sep="\n",collapse="\n"),file="t2.txt") </code></pre>  <p>writes</p>  <pre><code>&gt; a[CRLF]  &gt; b[CRLF]  &gt; c </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried write.table(eol="\n") - unsuccessfully as it seems to use cat internally.</p>  <p>I have looked for other workarounds;  I tried to find sth. in R\src\main\scan.c, locating the relevant code in line 387ff.</p>  <p>Anyone who knows how I can get UNIX-like LF in my output file?</p>
