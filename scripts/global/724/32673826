<p>I'm looking to get the relative path to the Resources Folder inside the core project of a Xamarin cross platform mobile application project. In fact, the file in question is a XML File that I want to be able to read in the future. At first it was in the specific Resources folders of each platform (iOs and Android), but I decided to move it to the Core project which has the logic needed in this case. Unfortunately since I moved it, my file reader throws an exception saying that there is no such file at the location I'm trying to read from. </p>  <p>This is the structure of my solution if it can help :</p>  <pre><code>CoreProject/   Resources/     FileIWantToRead.xml   Utils/     Reader.cs CoreProjectAndroid/   ... CoreProjectIOS/   ... </code></pre>  <p>I tried the following relative paths but none of them worked :</p>  <pre><code>../Resources/FileIWantToRead.xml CoreProject/Resources/FileIWantToRead.xml FileIWantToRead.xml </code></pre>  <p>For the last path in the previous list, the error message I get is that the file can't be found at this location :</p>  <pre><code>/Users/m.lachance/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/&lt;device-id&gt;/data/Containers/Bundle/Application </code></pre>  <p>Would there be a way for me to get that file in the core project and not have to set it in the projects of each platform ?</p>  <p>Thank you very much !</p>
