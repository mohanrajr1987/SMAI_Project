<p>I'm making an installer of sorts and basically need to copy a font from the installed fonts on the computer to an outside directory. Here's an example of what I want:</p>  <pre><code>Font f = new Font("Arial Black", Font.PLAIN, 20); FontWriter.write(f, new File("C:\temp\ariblk.ttf")); </code></pre>  <p>The font gets loaded into the Java program and is then written to disk as "ariblk.ttf" and can be used in another program. <em>Note: I need to do this because this other program can not load from the system's installed fonts, period. Please don't try to suggest a workaround or ask why.</em></p>  <p>So, how can I achieve this? Any ideas?</p>  <p>Is there a built-in feature in Java or something I can download from somewhere? I hope I don't need to code it myself since I'd have to read up on how ttf files are structured.</p>
