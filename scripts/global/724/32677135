<pre><code>f = open("test.txt", 'r+') print ("Name of the file: ", f.name) str = f.read(); str = str.split(',')  print(str2)  f.close() </code></pre>  <p>I need to read from a file and it gives the name of the class it has to make and the parameters it needs to pass.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>rectangle,9.7,7.3 square,6 </code></pre>  <p>so I have to make a rectangle object and pass those 2 parameters. then write it to another file with the results. I am stuck chopping up the string.</p>  <p>I use the split function to get rid of the commas, and it seems it returns a list which I am saving into the str list, which is probably bad, I should change the name. However, my concern is that although it does take the comma out. It keeps the ,\n, new line character and concatenates it to the next line. So it splits it like this ['rectangle', '9.7', '7.3\nsquare', ... how can I get rid of that.</p>  <p>Any suggestions would be welcomed. Should I read line by line instead of reading the whole thing?</p>
