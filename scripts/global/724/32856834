<p>I am trying to write a simple app where a text file is read and the two values stored in the file are read and printed. The int values can then be increased through the use of buttons. I have tried using file input and output streams to write and read files but I cannot find a way for the file to be read when the app is opened so the count can remain correct when the app is closed. Any help would be very appreciated. Thank you so much.</p>
