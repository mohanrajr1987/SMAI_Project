<p>I've got my file open using <code>r+</code> mode. I've made some alteration to it, and I would like to remove the contents of it starting from X to the end of the file.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I have no clue how to do that. I've been browsing through the docs, but there's no mention of that. </p>  <p>I don't want to write <code>:space:</code> to the file so it "looks" like it's cleared, I would like to make it smaller as well.</p>  <p>Opening the file using <code>w</code> is not an option in this case.</p>
