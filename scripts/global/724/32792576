<p>We just started the topic of low level functions in C and for a part of this assignment we have to ask for user input.  Normally I would use printf() and scanf() however for this assignment we are only allowed to use read(), write(), open(), close(), and lseek().</p>  <p>My question is how would you read input from the keyboard after printing to the screen? I understand that I would have to use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/read" rel="nofollow">read</a>, the file descriptor would be STDIN_FILENO, however how would I determine the size count? Also how would I keep track of what the user inputted? Would I have to create an char array just for that? </p>  <p>Also if anyone could reference some good reading material or tutorials for programming with low level functions that would help a lot.  </p>
