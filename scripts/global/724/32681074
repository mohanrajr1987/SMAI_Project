<p>I was wondering if it is perfectly safe to read one file onto another(before closing the buffer). Explanation for such a thing I would give is that the function open closes the buffer by itself automatically when using the same object.</p>  <p>Example code:</p>  <pre><code>fr = open("asd.txt", "r") text = fr.read() fr.close  fr = open("asd2.txt", "r") text = fr.read() fr.close ... </code></pre>  <p>Is this the same thing?</p>  <pre><code>fr = open("asd.txt", "r") text = fr.read()  fr = open("asd2.txt", "r") text = fr.read()  fr.close </code></pre>
