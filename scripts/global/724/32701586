<p>I was kind of struggling to get python into reading this particular text file..  (fig 1)</p>  <p>I tried some encoding (utf-8, ascii..)  But none worked.  Then after a while I found the solution in the traceback.  (fig 2)</p>  <p>Now my question is how does this result in an error when python is reading the right encoding? </p>  <p>Figure 1:</p>  <pre><code>rel_path = "DIR/text.txt" print ('Getting data from: ' + rel_path + ': \n') text_file = open(rel_path)  print (text_file.read()) </code></pre>  <p>Figure 2:</p>  <pre><code>File "test.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt; print (text_file.read()) File "LOCALDIR\Python\Python35\lib\encodings\cp850.py", line 19, in encode  return codecs.charmap_encode(input,self.errors,encoding_map)[0] UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2018' in position 4590:  character maps to &lt;undefined&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Note the file python reads PYTHONDIR\cp850.py &lt;-</p>  <p>When I add <strong>encoding='cp850'</strong> when opening the text file it works. (fig 3)</p>  <p>Figure 3: </p>  <pre><code>rel_path = "DIR/text.txt" print ('Getting data from: ' + rel_path + ': \n') text_file = open(rel_path, encoding='cp850')  print (text_file.read()) </code></pre>
