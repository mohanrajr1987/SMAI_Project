<p>I almost never worked with files in Java and now trying to find a solution for traversing directory structures.</p>  <p>I have a structure like this: <code>\uploaded\abc\Uncle Bob\Another Dir\Hello-123</code>. Here the <code>Hello-123</code> contains any kind of files and may contain more sub-directories.</p>  <p>Now the start path for this <code>\uploaded\abc\</code> from where I would start the walk. After this there is always 2 more directories, probably all the time, so that would be the maximum depth to walk in (after 'Another Dir').</p>  <p><strong>GOAL</strong>: Find a directory that matches the input and upload all the files only in that directory (or sub directories).</p>  <p><strong>Example</strong>: Given input <strong>Hello-123</strong> I want walk through all directories starting from the start path (maybe allow only depth +2 beyond that?) and do something with all the files in that directory (if found), after every file is processed then terminate the process.</p>  <p>Any help appreciated!</p>
