<p>This program asks the user to answer a set of 10 maths questions and then saves their name and score to a file that corresponds with the class number they are in.</p>  <p>I need the program to search for a line in a previously created file (The class file that contains their name and score), so that it can compare it with a new score. For example, if a user does the test twice, their highest score should be the only one that will be recorded.</p>  <pre><code>class_name = class_name + ".txt"  file = open(class_name , 'a')#opens the file in #'append' mode so you dont delete all the information name = (name) file.write(str(name + " " + ln + " : "))#writes the information to the file file.write(str(score)) file.write('\n')     file.close()    #safely closes the file to save the information </code></pre>
