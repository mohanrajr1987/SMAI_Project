<p>I am very new to docker, and I need help to dockerize a ruby script that takes a a input directory and output directory. </p>  <p>i.e <code>generate_rr_pair.rb BuildRR -n /data/  -o /output</code></p>  <p>What the script does, is it will take the -n option (input) and check if the directory exists, if it does it uses the files inside as input. The script will then output data to the -o option (output). If the output directory doesn't exist, the script will create the directory and output files there. </p>  <p>How can I create a Dockerfile to handle this? Should I pass these in, as environment variables? Or should I use mounted Volumes? But since the script handles fileIO, I am not sure if I want volumes. The input directory should already exist on the host, and the output directory will get created. Both directories, should remain after docker container stops. </p>
