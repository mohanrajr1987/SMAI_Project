<p>So, my end goal is to use an input file to instantiate an <code>ArrayList</code> of Letter objects. The file contains multiple cases of the following format:</p>  <pre><code>from-to line 1 ... line n </code></pre>  <p>(*** is used as an indicator of a new letter. There are no blank lines between input lines, in other words, each line is followed immediately by a return and then the next line.)</p>  <p>Yet before I even attempt to instantiate multiple Letter objects, I am just trying to get the first one to work.</p>  <pre><code>Scanner in = new Scanner(_file).useDelimiter("\\s+?|-"); ArrayList&lt;Letter&gt; letters = new ArrayList(); String from = in.next(); String to = in.next(); Letter temp = new Letter(from,to); String s = in.next(); temp.addLine(s); </code></pre>  <p>Where a Letter object takes two strings for the recipient and writer and can then have lines added to it. So my output should be:</p>  <pre><code>Dear Recipient: Line 1 ... Line n Sincerely, Writer </code></pre>  <p>But when I use this my output is:</p>  <pre><code>Dear Recipient:   Sincerely, Writer </code></pre>
