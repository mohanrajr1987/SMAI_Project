<p>Today I had a programming interview and was ask to make a problem on c++, I lost all my time writing the parsing input, so I am asking what's the best way to parse a cli interface input, the problem needs to multiply an indefinite number of matrix with the next input format:</p>  <pre><code>| 1 0 0 | | 2 | | 0 1 0 | | 4 | | 0 0 1 | | 6 | </code></pre>  <p>There's no need to be nxn x nxn, there can be matrix like this:</p>  <pre><code>| 1  2  3  | | -1 -2 | | 11 12 13 | | 10 11 |              | -9 -8 | </code></pre>  <p>And there be more than just two matrix, what's the best way to parse the input end convert it to an integer array?</p>
