<p>Ok guys, I am completely over my head here. The Java courses at the college I just transferred from did not prepare me for the Java courses I am currently in, and it feels like a wile goose chase on this one.  With that being said, here we go.</p>  <p>This is the homework problem I am working on:</p>  <p>1) Create a Pixel Class, which contains an X coordinate, a Y coordinate, and a Color, as well as a draw(Graphics page) method, which displays the appropriate point.</p>  <p>2) Create a PixelReader class that reads a .txt file, and converts the data in the file to an ArrayList of Pixels.  The conversion method should be static and should be called getPixels(String fileName).  Remember that your method must declare that it throws an IOException.</p>  <p>3) Create a PixelPanel class that takes an ArrayList as a parameter.  The Panel should display the pixels.  The default dimensions of the PixelPanel class should be 100 x 100.</p>  <p>NOTE:  Some of the data points are beyond the range allowed to RGB values.  You can handle those exceptional cases however you like.  For example, just reduce them to 255, reduce them to zero, find the remainder when divided by 256, or just throw the point out altogether.</p>  <p>I was good up until I got to reading the values from the text file into an ArrayList. Here is how the data is printed:</p>  <pre><code>31 53 71 76 282 19 15 203 50 197 29 34 203 33 239 43 94 73 170 211 54 27 229 85 205 54 54 113 121 147 </code></pre>  <p>....ect. until the end of the file.</p>  <p>The data for each line is supposed to be x, y, height, width, color, if I read the instructions right. </p>  <p>Now, What I have so far in my code is this:</p>  <pre><code>package pixelpainthw;  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.awt.Color; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileNotFoundException; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import javax.swing.JOptionPane;  /** * * @author R.Scott */ public class PixelReader  {      public static String filename = "pixels.txt";     public static FileReader reader;      public static ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; pixelsInput() throws  FileNotFoundException, IOException {             ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; allPixels = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();     String[] currentPixelString;      try     {         reader = new FileReader(filename);     }     catch(FileNotFoundException e)     {         filename = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"File not found.\n"         + "Please locate and input the correct filepath.");     }     finally     {         JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "File successfully found.");     }        return allPixels; } }` </code></pre>  <p>I have tried for several hours to construct code after the first try/catch that would read each line independently, put it into an array or arrayList, then append that to the master arraylist (allPixels) then send that to the class which actually draws the pixels, but the compiler keeps shooting out errors such as can't convert String[] to ArrayList, can't add array to arrayList, etc., and now I am supremely frustrated with it.</p>  <p>I'm not asking anyone to write the code for me, but to point me in the right direction as to how to look at it in a way to wrap my head around it.  Also, please remember that I'm still new to coding, so a complicated response that only a Doctorate level student could understand will probably go right over my head. </p>  <p>Much appreciated guys. </p>  <p>If needed, I can provide the other classes I have written in the program as well.</p>
