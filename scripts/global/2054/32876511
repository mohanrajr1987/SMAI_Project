<p>I have to design a program that gets 3 user-inputs in the form:</p>  <pre><code>Name1   (any number of spaces)  age1 Name2   (any number of spaces)  age3 Name3   (any number of spaces)  age3 </code></pre>  <p>Then print line which has the highest age (suppose Name3 age3 had the highest age I'd print his line).</p>  <p>My Code:</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.*; public class RankAge{     public static void main(String[] args){     System.out.println("Enter 3 different names and the age of each person respectively:");     Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);     String n1 = sc.nextLine();     String n2 = sc.nextLine();     String n3 = sc.nextLine();      } } </code></pre>  <p>I know how to scan the user-inputs, but i don't know how to do a comparison of the number within the acquired string to print a specific one (also since there can be any number of spaces it seems even more complicated to me).</p>
