<p>I'm having trouble multiplying a string by a variable that is a integer. Integer is in as variable form because it is an input that is entered by the user. However I cannot get the them to multiply together so I can print them. The program complies and runs but encounters a syntax error when it encounters the code where they're multiplied together.</p>  <pre><code>gapVal=(" ")  gapSp=int(input("Please enter a the amount of spaces between the stars")) gapSp2=(gapSp)-2 gapSp3=(gapSp2)-2  print("*", gapSp, "*", gapSp2, "*", gapSp3, "*") </code></pre>
