<p>I have created a program where you can "hack" fake bank accounts for money based on what the password for the account is. I assigned <code>money</code> as 0 (since the game is the type of game that restarts each time you open it), and <code>lives</code> as 100 since you have 100 lives to get as much money as you can. Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>#PASSWORD GUESSING MONEY GAME # # # # import random import time  print('Hello, please enter a name for your bank account.') bank_acc = input() print('Welcome to your bank account: ' + bank_acc) print("$$$: 0") print('Just press ENTER when ready.') print('At the press of a button, you will have access to hundreds of millions of bank accounts.') print('But do not be so quick, you will be required to hack the password of each bank account.') print('Each and every password is a 3-digit code.') print('You have 100 lives to do so. Each time you get the password wrong, subtracts a life') print('After you use up all 100 lives, your bank account will be reset.') print('Good luck')   money = 0 lives = 100  def game():     passwords = random.randint(100, 999)      while lives &lt;= 100:         print('Take a guess')         guess = input()         guess = int(guess)          if guess &lt; passwords:             print('Password incorrect. Number too low.')             lives = lives - 1          if guess &gt; passwords:             print('Password incorrect. Number too high')             lives = lives -1          if guess == passwords:             break      if guess == passwords:         money = money + passwords         print('Hacking account...')         time.sleep(1)         print('.')         time.sleep(1)         print('.')         time.sleep(1)         print('.')         print('Account hacked.')         print('...Adding money to account...')         print('Your Account:')         print('$$$: ' + str(money))         print('Lives: ' + str(lives))         print('...NEXT ACCOUNT...')         print('')         print('')         time.sleep(2)         game() game() </code></pre>  <p>When it says <code>lives</code> was referenced before assignment. I understand that since <code>lives</code> wasn't assigned in the block of code that had <code>while lives &lt;= 100:</code> But where could I place the assignments to make the assignment before it is referenced. I know where you could place it but... If someone was to guess the password correct, I don't want to money to be reset back to 0 and the lives to be reset back to 100 when going on to the next account. Please help, and thank you!!!</p>
