<p>I'm struggling big time in my intro to java class. I really need to get this assignment done but I'm stuck. Could somebody point me in the right direction?</p>  <p>Here is what it asks:</p>  <p>•   Asks the user to enter 2 integers (can be one prompt or two)</p>  <p>•   Gets and stores the ints</p>  <p>•   Explains that the program will generate all integers that are between the numbers and are divisible by a third integer. •   Asks the user for the number they should be divisible by</p>  <p>•   Gets and stores that int</p>  <p>•   Since 0 will be an illegal input to your program, keep asking them for the number they should be divisible by while they keep doing it wrong.</p>  <p>•   If the first number is smaller, then generate divisible numbers from the first up to the second (not including the two numbers themselves) •   Else generate divisible numbers from the first down to the second (not including the two numbers themselves)</p>  <p>Here is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code>package loop;  import java.util.*;  public class MinilabLoopLogic {     public static void main(String[ ] args)     {         int number1;         int number2;         int divisor;          Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in);  //you do it!         System.out.print("Please enter 2 integers (separated by spaces): ");         number1 = kb.nextInt();         number2 = kb.nextInt();          if (number1 &lt; number2)                     System.out.println("\n\nThis program will generate numbers BETWEEN "                 + number1 + " " +  number2);          System.out.print("\nPlease enter the integer your output should be divisible by: ");         divisor = kb.nextInt();          int max, min;         if (number1 &lt; number2){             max = number2;             min = number1;         }         else {             max = number1;             min = number2;         }          if (number1 &lt; number2){              for (min % max == divisor); ++         }          //Watch out for divide by zero!         System.out.println("\n\n----------------------------------------");         //Be able to handle 1st number smaller          //   OR 2nd number smaller          //Use the modulus operator to check if a number is divisible      }//end main()  } </code></pre>
