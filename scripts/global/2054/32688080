<p>I have 2 classes. 1. Main and 2. Gun.</p>  <p>Gun:</p>  <pre><code>public class Gun {     private int ammoAmount = 15;     public int getAmmoAmount() { //I believe this allows me to see the value of ammoAmount and use it in Main class.         return ammoAmount; // Returns the value of ammoAmount to getAmmoAmount?     }     public Gun(int ammoUsage) { //this is the constructor right?         ammoAmount = ammoAmount - ammoUsage; //Method that makes ammoAmount decrease by ammoUsage.     }     public void newAmmoAmount() {         System.out.println("You have " + ammoAmount + " bullet(s) left."); // output of how much bullet is left.     } } </code></pre>  <p>Main:</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Random; public class Main {      public static void main(String[] args) {          Random rand = new Random();         Gun fire1 = new Gun(0); // I need this to create an objective?         fire1.newAmmoAmount(); // I need this for code below?         int clip = fire1.getAmmoAmount(); // I need this to set clip for while loop?         do { //starts loop         int x = 5; //max # random can go to.         int y = rand.nextInt(x); //Makes random integer from 0 to 5 for variable y.         Gun fire = new Gun(y); //This is the objective that uses the constructor?         System.out.println("You shot " + y + " bullet(s)."); //Print's out shots from random value y.         fire.newAmmoAmount(); //uses method in Gun class?         } while( clip &gt; 0); //loops method till clip is less than 0.     } } </code></pre>  <p>I try running the program but it keeps on looping and never ends. The value for ammoAmount is not saved in Gun class. How do I make it so that I can change an int value from a different class?</p>  <p>I had a recent question for it as well. I tried using Constructors as he stated.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32681387/how-do-i-call-a-class-into-a-class-from-main-and-keep-the-output-values/32681515?noredirect=1#comment53208899_32681515">How do I call a class into a class from main? and keep the output values?</a></p>  <p>But as you can see I'm not very successful. This is just a smaller concept of a bigger one I was trying to get to. So basically, did I do Constructors right? And what is the fix for this?</p>  <p>I added some comments to the source code to show you what other questions I might possibly have and if I did those right as well.</p>
