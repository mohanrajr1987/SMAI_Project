<p>I'm just start to make an application. I got some textfield that must filled with integer value, but when the textfield is empty, I want the value is still null in database rather than must add "0".</p>  <p>it's something like this</p>  <pre><code>        DR.IN = Me.txtIn.Text         DR.OUT = Me.txtOut.Text </code></pre>  <p>the two of that is integer value, that when i'm save to data base the error comes and said</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Nullable Object Must Have Value</p> </blockquote>  <p>I must add "0", but I want the data is still null. Do anyone know how to do that?</p>  <p>thanks for your help and sorry for really bad grammar, I hope someone out there would understand my question :)</p>
