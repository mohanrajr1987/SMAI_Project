<p>I would like to make a MySQL database view pertaining to the 'quantity' of a submission, which will be formatted like this:  </p>  <pre><code>Anderson | Wood | $897.55 : 548.78$, Quantity: 3** .... </code></pre>  <p>There will seemingly always be a 'Quantity: " string followed by the quantity number. Is there a way to find the integer that comes after another particular string?  This way I can put the quantity in its own row and use that to dynamically find the price.</p>
