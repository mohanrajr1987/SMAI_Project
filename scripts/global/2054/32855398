<p>Due to my original post being filled with flamers assuming that I'm asking them to write my code for me and refusing to answer me at all, I'm reposting my question.</p>  <p>I stress the fact that I am a total BEGINNER at Python, and that I am NOT here to ask people to write it for me, I'm simply trying to ascertain the METHOD and some GUIDANCE on how to approach the problem, because I'm having real difficulty approaching it, and everyone seems to think I'm asking them to give me all the code I need, and I'm not.</p>  <p>So, on to my original question.</p>  <p>My problem is as follows, I have made a mathematics quiz, that outputs the name and score to a text file. In this program, I plan to add some code at the beginning, which will run a list of options to compare and order the results from the text file. The program imports the entries into a list, and the format is as follows:</p>  <p>['John : 6', 'Bob : 9', 'Billy : 2', 'Matthew : 7', 'Jimmy : 2', 'Amy: 9', 'Jenny : 10', 'Michael : 8']</p>  <p>Python recognizes this list as 8 items, perfect. It has their name, and then their score. The problem is that the specification I'm working to requires me to be able to:</p>  <p>Sort in alphabetical order with each student's highest score for the tests.</p>  <p>Also, by the highest score, and finally by the average score. I've tried for many hours in order to find some code that can compare the integers within these strings to each other to find the highest score, and only print that one, but I've had no luck. I feel like I will also struggle with the other 2 tasks, and wish for some guidance.</p>  <p>I thought about possibly using slices in order to take the integer into a separate value in order to compare them, but felt that this could make the code messy very quickly.</p>
