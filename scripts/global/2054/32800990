<p>This is a very simple script I am trying to figure out and I have been looking for a simple answer and can't find it in the forums or in my C# book.</p>  <pre><code>Console.Write("Enter a Number\n"); int input = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); //convert code to an integer  if (!Int32.IsNumber(input)) //if not a whole number input give an error {     Console.WriteLine("Not an integer"); } </code></pre>  <p>It's just that simple what I'm trying to do.  This is a snippet from a bigger code.</p>
