<p>I have a basic doubt, we can increment reference of Integer class object, while not reference of any other class(D class has 1 Integer data member and one parameterized constructor).</p>  <pre><code>Integer x=new Integer(10); x++;     D d=new D(10); d++; </code></pre>  <p>here both x and d are reference still we are able to increment Integer reference while not any other reference. I am missing something very basic, please help me out.</p>
