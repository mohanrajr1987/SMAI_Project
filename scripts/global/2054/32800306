<p>Below is my code: When I run it, I get the following statements:</p>  <pre><code>X is equal to 1 and k is equal to 1  X is equal to 0 and k is equal to 0  </code></pre>  <p>What I wish to achieve is to have both statements stating the same thing (equal to 1). I understand I can just set the integers x, and k respectively to 1 underneath the if statement, however I want to know how to store a value after the function is executed, so that x and k remain equal to one after execution of the second function.</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;   void run_times( int runs);  int main (){     int i;      while ( i &lt;3) {         run_times(i);         printf("Looped\n");         i++;     } }  void run_times( int runs) {     int *x,k;      if (runs == 0) {         x = &amp;k;         *x = 1;         printf("X is equal to %d and k is equal to%d\n", *x, k);     }        if (runs == 1){         printf("X is equal to %d and k is equal to%d\n", *x, k);     } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
