<p>I'm writing a program where you need to enter in minutes how long you have been cycling and then it displays how long you have been riding in hours <code>hh:mm</code> so for instance if the user wrote in 88 mins it should display 1:28</p>  <p>I have looked for hours now and cannot find how to do it, probably doesn't help I am a total novice to coding :)</p>  <pre><code> //input data             Console.Write("Number of Minutes spent Cycling...");             int cycling = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); //perform calculations              TimeSpan cTime = TimeSpan.FromHours(cycling);             string fromTimeString = cTime.ToString("hh':'mm"); //output results             Console.WriteLine("cycling {0}", cTime);              Console.ReadLine();         } </code></pre>  <p>this is just one of the many ways i have tried, thank you for any help :)</p>
