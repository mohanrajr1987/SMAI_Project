<p>So for an assignment I have to create an application whose <code>main()</code> method holds two variables. After declaring the variables and assigning an integer to each of them, I have to run both through the same 3 methods. I was thinking that I have to create a class for the variables, but honestly have no idea where to begin. So far, I have figured out how to run one of the integers through the methods, but I can't get both to pass through the same methods.  Here is my work so far:</p>  <pre><code>public class ArithmeticMethods{     public class integer     {     int firstInteger = 10;     int secondInteger = 20;     }     public static void main(String[] args) {         displayNumberPlus10();         displayNumberPlus100();         displayNumberPlus1000();         System.out.println(firstInteger + " +" + " 10" + " is " + displayNumberPlus10());         System.out.println(firstInteger + " +" + " 100" + " is " + displayNumberPlus100());         System.out.println(firstInteger + " +" + " 1000" + " is " + displayNumberPlus1000());     }      public static int displayNumberPlus10() {         int numberPlus10;         numberPlus10 = (firstInteger + 10);         return numberPlus10;     }     public static int displayNumberPlus100() {         int numberPlus100;         numberPlus100 = (firstInteger + 100);         return numberPlus100;     }     public static int displayNumberPlus1000() {         int numberPlus1000;         numberPlus1000 = (firstInteger + 1000);         return numberPlus1000;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Right now the methods are set to only run the first variable and with my ATTEMPT at creating a class, the program doesn't work at all. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also I apologize if the code looks ugly. I am very new to this.</p>
