<p>I have the following array of strings:</p>  <pre><code>x = ["1.2", "1.1", "1.18", "1.18.3", "1.4", "1.18.20", "2.5"] </code></pre>  <p>Ruby's Array sort method is sorting the strings alphabetically which results in this:</p>  <pre><code>[ [0] "1.1", [1] "1.18", [2] "1.18.20", [3] "1.18.3", [4] "1.2", [5] "1.4", [6] "2.5", ] </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to sort this array based on the numerical value within each decimal so that it returns the following order:</p>  <pre><code>[ [0] "1.1", [1] "1.2", [2] "1.4", [3] "1.18", [4] "1.18.3", [5] "1.18.20", [6] "2.5" ] </code></pre>  <p>I also can't guarantee the number of decimal points within each "ID". Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!</p>
