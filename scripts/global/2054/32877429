<p>I am trying to read info from a txt file. The text file is in the following format:</p>  <pre><code>1 I like programming. 2 "but I am new at it"  3 -so I need to go  4 on web sites, 5 to get 6 help.  7 I appreciate any help you could give me. 8 Thanks.    </code></pre>  <p>I want to display it as follows, while adding "Chap", for chapter, before each number.</p>  <pre><code>Chap 1 I like programming.  Chap 2 "but I am new at it"  Chap 3 -so I need to go  Chap 4 on web sites, Chap 5 to get  Chap 6 help.  Chap 7 I appreciate any help you could give me. Chap 8 Thanks.  </code></pre>  <p>This is what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>public class ReadAFile {  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {      // Get bible book names, chapters and verses     File fileIn = new File("t.txt");     Scanner inputFile = new Scanner(fileIn);                      while(inputFile.hasNext())     {         // Read all lines from the file.         String line = inputFile.nextLine();         System.out.println(line);         String[] tokens = line.split(" ");               for(int i = 0; i &lt; tokens.length; i++)         {             if(tokens[i].matches("^-?\\d+$")) // I'mm using this to try to find the numbers in the txt file             {                 for(int p = 0; p &lt; tokens.length; p++)                 {                     System.out.println(tokens[p]);                                       }                    }         }                                }                inputFile.close(); }    } </code></pre>  <p>The output is not what I am looking for and I can't figure out why. I either get every word on its own line or multiple lines of the the same sentence.</p>
