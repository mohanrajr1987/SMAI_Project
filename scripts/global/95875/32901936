<p>Can I have two (or more) Spring-boot applications running on one Tomcat?</p>  <p>I have two applications packaged as <code>war</code> files and I would like to run them on one Tomcat server. However, when I deploy them, I get the following exception:</p>  <pre><code>org.springframework.jmx.export.UnableToRegisterMBeanException: Unable to register MBean [org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.jmx.DataEndpointMBean@2361d8ee] with key 'dumpEndpoint'; nested exception is javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: org.springframework.boot:type=Endpoint,name=dumpEndpoint </code></pre>  <p>The default endpoints that every Spring-boot application registers (like /health etc.) clash. Is there some workaround for this or is not possible to achieve this setup?</p>  <p>Thank you for any responses! </p>
