<p>I need to handle emails from about 30 addresses. I implement this in a way where all emails going to one <code>DirectChannel</code> and after to <code>Receiver</code>. In <code>Receiver</code> I can understand from what address is message comes, to do this I create <code>CustomMessageSource</code> that wraps <code>javax.mail.Message</code> to my own type that contains <code>javax.mail.Message</code> and some <code>Enum</code>. Looks like this is not a good decision, cause I can use <code>@Transformer</code>, but how can I use it if I have only 1 channel?</p>  <p>That was the first question.</p>  <p><strong>Second question:</strong></p>  <p>Should I use <em>ONE</em> channel and <em>ONE</em> receiver for all that addresses? Or better to have channel and receiver for each mail address? I don't understand Spring so deeply to feel the difference.</p>  <p>p.s. this question is continuation of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32826864/spring-multiple-imapadapter/32827733#32827733">Spring multiple imapAdapter</a></p>
