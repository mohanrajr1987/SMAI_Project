<p>In Spring Boot I attempt to inject a boolean value to an instance variable from an enviroment property which is set (<code>enabled=true</code>).</p>  <pre><code>@Value("${enabled}") private boolean enabled; </code></pre>  <p>However Spring cannot resolve this for some reason and reports:</p>  <pre><code>Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid boolean value [${enabled}] </code></pre>  <p>It seems like it does not replace expression <code>${enabled}</code> with the property value.</p>  <p>What needs to be set ? Why doesn't work this by default ?</p>
