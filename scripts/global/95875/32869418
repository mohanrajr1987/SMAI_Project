<p>I'm getting started with JHipster and am attempting to initialize my data using liquibase.  I have added two entities via the JHipster yo task and have added my two csv files into the /resources/config/liquibase directory and added the relevant loadData section to my "added entity" change log files to point at the CSV's.  I had to update the MD5hash in the databasechangelog table and the app is running BUT, the CSV files don't seem to get picked up via the loadData elements I added to the "added entity" XML files. No data is inserted.  Any ideas how to go about running this down?</p>
