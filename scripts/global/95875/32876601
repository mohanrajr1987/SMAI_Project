<p>I realize that to programmatically exit a SpringBoot 4 application I want to call the exit() method of SpringApplication, but how can I get a reference to it? </p>  <p>Of course I have access to it in my main() method, but I ask because if I'm in some class that is loading a resource and fails, I want to terminate the app, but from that class I can't figure out how to access SpringApplication.</p>  <p>Thanks...</p>
