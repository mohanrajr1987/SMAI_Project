<p>I'm generating a documentation for an ASP.Net project written in C#. I found that there is one depreciated namespace in the project, but there isn't enough time to clean it up right now, so I just wanted to mark it as such. I found that there is a <code>\depreciated</code> instruction in Doxygen and it indeed adds information about the element (namespace, class, method etc.) being depreciated. However this info is only visible on this element's details page and I would like for this information to be visible on the class tree (and packages tree) view. Is there an automated way to include depreciated keyword in the description?</p>  <p>It would be even better if the depreciated keyword was linking to the depreciated page (the page gets generated when Doxygen finds the <code>\depreciated</code> instruction in your code).</p>  <p>I know I can I just add the depreciated keyword to descriptions myself (and I'll do that if I won't find a better solution), but I'd like to know if there is a better solution.</p>
