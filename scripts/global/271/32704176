<p>I'm trying to generate documentation using pdoc, where my docstrings look like this:</p>  <pre><code>""" I am a description of what a method does  :param param1: an integer :param param2: a str """ </code></pre>  <p>I found this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7033239/how-to-preserve-line-breaks-when-generating-python-docs-using-sphinx">How to preserve line breaks when generating python docs using sphinx</a> but the suggestion of prefixing each line with | did not work for me (it just showed up like this)</p>  <pre><code>| :param param1: an integer | :param param2: a str </code></pre>  <p>any ideas short of using \n at the end of every line?</p>
