<p>This is a similar question to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15694267/how-to-easily-create-github-friendly-markdown-for-documented-javascript-function">How to easily create Github friendly markdown for documented JavaScript functions?</a>, but mine is about <code>C++</code>.</p>  <p>Currently I have a very simple project (2 files, 3 classes). The project won't grow any more and I'd like to keep the documentation as simple as possible. I tried doxygen, but it seems unnecessarily complex for my needs. I'm talking about documenting 3 classes with ~3 methods each, so I'd like to fit everything in a single markdown file.</p>
