<p>I am currently looking for a wiki where im able to create two things:  </p>  <ol> <li>A user guide (step by step guide through the software)  </li> <li>A reference documentation like one could look up certain things about the software (from the user perspective)</li> </ol>  <p>An aditional requirement would be that the wiki is portable, meaning in the case its not bound to a specific server but can be extracted into a zip file or something similar to be able to hand it to the other party without a lot of complications. </p>  <p>Since this will be for a customer it should also provide an professional look retarding style. </p>  <p>I was thinking maybe there are some tools out there to create something like the MSDN library from Microsoft. </p>
