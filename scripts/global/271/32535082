<p>I have plotted something with <strong>Mayavi/mlab</strong>, and I can't remember what the proper syntax is </p>  <ul> <li>to set the camera position, </li> <li>change the view angle, or </li> <li>turn parallel projection on/off</li> <li>etc</li> </ul>  <p>Is there a faster way to get this syntax than wading through the mlab <strong>documentation</strong>, or asking another question on Stack Overflow?</p>
