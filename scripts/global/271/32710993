<p>For <code>.net</code> based application, one way to keep track of changes globally is version control (our team uses <code>SVN</code>), but is there a documentation way through which, by specifying a certain API method, I get a list of changes made to the method, the same way as commits get displayed in a log? </p>  <p>I am aware that <code>.net</code> uses XML documentation and that I could simply list the updates in the  tag of a method itself. But that would add unnecessary content for most users uninterested in the update history of the API.  Any ideas?</p>
