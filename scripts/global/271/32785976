<p>In my GitHub repo I have several <code>.md</code> files (documenting requirements/design) inside the master branch, but when I edit them they don't have the fancy Wiki editing environment with choices of markdown, hints, etc. </p>  <p>It seems that GitHub only gives that to me for pages in the wiki/ branch. These docs need to stay synced with the code, so I want them in master (or code forks, not wiki). Am I misunderstanding the wiki branch? If not, is there a way to work around this limitation?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3gCT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3gCT.png" alt="screen shot"></a></p>
