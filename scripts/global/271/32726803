<p>I want to write something like:</p>  <pre><code>:param :class:`~src.db.user.User` user: </code></pre>  <p>So that I can access the User class from the documentation of a parameter.</p>  <p>My example doesn't work because I use colons inside an expression that is surrounded by colons.</p>  <p>Can this actually be made?</p>  <hr>  <h1>Update</h1>  <p>As a temporary solution I simply wrote:</p>  <pre><code>:param User user: </code></pre>  <p>Sphinx magically made the reference as I originaly wanted! How can I be sure that this will always work? What if two classes have the same name?</p>
