<p>I been playing with APIdoc.js for the past few days and I can't seem to figure out how to make versioning work. I understand I need to save my old APIDOC comment code into another file with <code>@APIVersioning</code> on the new / old code according to <a href="http://apidocjs.com/#example-versioning" rel="nofollow">APIDOC</a>. No matter where I stick this old file I can't seem to get it to work and there isn't any hinting in this example about how its loading the old code to create this versioning. Any assisted will be greatly appreciated.</p>
