<p>I'm working on a project which is a UI framework written in JavaScript. It's used by constructing a JSON model, which defines the JavaScript widgets and configuration to use, which is then parsed into an HTML page. The JSON configuration also defines actions on the widgets and relationships between them.</p>  <p>We currently have half-decent JSDoc on the underlying JS widgets, however it's only partly useful for people trying to build these models, especially if they don't have the time available to fully understand the underlying widgets (and why should they). The underlying framework - and the resultant JS App - uses pub/sub and so the definition of messages also needs to be documented. <em>An example of this pub/sub messaging would be where a button on the page should publish a specific message, which means that a service on the page should pick that up and then do something specific.</em></p>  <p>I cannot seem to find any suitable means of documenting the possible ways of constructing the models, especially when it comes to what can be nested, what can be configured, etc.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
