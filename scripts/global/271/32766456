<p>I am trying to write user-manual/tutorial for my library using doxygen (something similar to the user-manual of the doxygen itself! - <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>)</p>  <p>I used .md files <strong>subpage</strong>ed from the <code>mainpage</code> to create my document hierarchy. I ended up something similar to that of OpenCV (<a href="http://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow">link</a>), which looks quite nice, but it still does not have many features of that of doxygen user manual. For example, page/section index on the left and page wise table of content on the right. </p>  <p>Is there any way of generating expandable index/table of content and attach it in every pages using doxygen (as in <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>)? Is there a better of doing this? Any other tips?</p>
