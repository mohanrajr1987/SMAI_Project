<p>Ansible modules like <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/stat_module.html" rel="nofollow">stat</a> provide a "Return Values" section in their documentation which clearly describe what values are available after you "register" the output of the command. </p>  <p>The <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ec2_vpc_module.html" rel="nofollow">ec2_vpc module</a> documentation doesn't have a "Return Values" section that I can see. </p>  <p>Does anyone else know where the return values for this module are documented? (Other than in the source code, which doesn't count as a proper answer)</p>
