<p>Apologies if this is too basic, or a duplicate, but I'm confused here. I can't find an answer in the GitHub help (I did look) and I did ask some software developers (I'm using GitHub to store documentation) and they didn't know either!</p>  <p>Here's the scenario: I have a GitHub repository (call it 'A'). If someone wants to make updates they fork that repository to one of their own (call it 'B'). They can then click 'Clone in Desktop' to get a local copy.</p>  <p>They make edits locally and then open GitHub Desktop. </p>  <p>In GitHub Desktop they can use 'Commit to Master' and then hit the 'Sync' button. This syncs them with repository B. If they want to then copy the edits to repository A, they go into GitHub and make a pull request. I get that.</p>  <p>But GitHub Desktop also has a 'Pull Request' button, and I don't get who it's making the request to! Is it repository A or repository B? Or something completely different?</p>  <p>If it's repository B, then what's the difference between commit/sync and the pull request button?</p>  <p>I can't try it out because that button is always greyed out for me (maybe because I own the repository?)</p>  <p>And can a user make a pull request directly into repository A from GitHub Desktop - or will it always be a two-step process via repository B?</p>
