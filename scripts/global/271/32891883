<p>Eloquent has a method called <code>save()</code>, which takes an optional array of parameters (options).  However, the <a href="http://laravel.com/api/5.1/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Model.html#method_save" rel="nofollow">API reference</a> doesn't seem to explain what these options are.</p>  <p>Is there a list somewhere that I'm missing?  I could track them down through the source code of course (I see <code>touch</code> and <code>timestamp</code>, at least), but I figured at the very least this question would be useful as a reference to others.</p>
