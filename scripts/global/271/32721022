<p>How does the application caching work in Chrome? </p>  <p>Is there a method to completly cache a javascript app, and to syncronize the database after a possible disconnection with the remote server (natively too), and store it for some days, if needed?</p>  <p>Is somewhere a good documentation for javascript applied to this context?</p>  <p>How it works? </p>  <p>Thank you very much</p>
