<p>Is there a way to generate documentation for a reusable chart module? For large libraries, it seems like a lot of work to write everything by hand.</p>  <p>Looking at examples of large d3 charting libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/novus/nvd3" rel="nofollow">nvd3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3" rel="nofollow">c3</a>, they have fairly large documentation. Is there a way to autmatically generate such documentation by parsing comments in the code (a Grunt task for example)?</p>
