<p>In the Quick Help Inspector (image attached) is written that function <strong>viewDidAppear(animated: Bool)</strong> is available for 8.1 and later.  But in the Xcode documentation is written:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Available in iOS 2.0 and later.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Can someone comment why it is like that?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BQ7oN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BQ7oN.png" alt="Quick Help Inspector"></a></p>
