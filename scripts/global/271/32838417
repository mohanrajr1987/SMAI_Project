<p>Is there any convenient way to read &amp; access the project-documentation of a Python packages -  f.e. like a ReadTheDocs-documentation (<a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a> for bs4 in this case)- offline? </p>  <p>I know that there is a pydoc-server, docstrings and so on. However, these do not include the full documentation like tutorials, quickstarts etc. Is there an equivalent feature in Python like the vignettes in R?</p>
