<p>I have come across Google Doc Viewer that lets you view online files  in many formats ( PDF, doc, ppt,.....) on your server using iframe and embed parameter. Example:</p>  <pre> iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.myserver.com/test.pdf&embedded=true" width="620" height="420" frameborder="0" style="border:0" > </pre>  <p>I tried this approach and it is working fine.  However, I would like to capture all user interactions and events from this document viewer.</p>  <p>I tired searching web for APIs but did not find anything ! ( came across Google Books Viewer but that is different. ).</p>  <p>It would be great if someone can point out the right API for the same.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
