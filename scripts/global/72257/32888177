<p>Using Filemaker Go onto iPhone/iPad, it's possible to use WebViewer to display local pdf and that is cool, but documents shown are scrollable but not zoomable in any way.</p>  <p>It would be great if pdf could be zoomed in and out. </p>  <p>Is there any setting or any workaround to accomplish the task to show a pdf in WebViewer and have the ability to zoom it ?</p>
