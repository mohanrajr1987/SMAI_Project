<p>I have integrated successfully elFinder to Summernote (WYSIWYG) by following <a href="https://github.com/summernote/summernote/issues/1203" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>. But I'm facing one problem when I attempt to add another image by clicking to load the dialog again. It seems like elFinder cannot find the path to image folder again.</p>  <ul> <li>The tree list folder structure doesn't show up</li> <li>The thumbnail shows the 'Panda Icon' indicating that those images are not found</li> </ul>  <p>But the image does insert to the textarea, when I select the not found thumbnail. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N7pg3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N7pg3.jpg" alt="screenshot"></a></p>  <p>How can I fix this?</p>
