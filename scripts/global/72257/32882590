<p>My problem is pretty stupid. I am hosting about 20 sites right now. I deleted some records out of the DNS configuration Manager in Windows Server 2012 Datacenter edition. I am in a remote connection and trying to configure the right DNS record to get the prefix <strong>www</strong>.domain.com. Can someone quickly tell me which kind of record I need and where I should point it to?</p>  <p>I have tried CNAME records and A records. No result. So I might do something wrong.</p>  <p>Greetings, Ben</p>  <p>PS: Sorry for my bad English</p>
