<p>when it's on pc screen it's no big deal but viewing on mobile it shows this blank space that can be scrolled. I used Creative template from startbootstrap. The original template didn't show it, but only now. I have no idea where it came from and not enough knowledge to go digging. </p>  <p><a href="http://ownscene.com/index-en.html" rel="nofollow">http://ownscene.com/index-en.html</a></p>  <p>here's what it looks like on small screens <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ndNV1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/ndNV1.jpg</a></p>  <p>Thank you</p>
