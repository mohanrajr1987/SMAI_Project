<p>A family member of mine is selling homemade soap, candles and reed diffusers.</p>  <p>There will be 3 different product categories, 8 different scents, with new scents being developed and added over the coming months.</p>  <p>What would be the most efficient (not easiest) way to setup product listings?</p>  <p>My HTML and CSS is ok and I'm currently learning C# and ASP so I primarily use Visual Studio.</p>  <p>Would it be best practice to learn and use an SQL database to store the products and then format them onto the website?</p>  <p>Should I just list the products on the page since there are only going to be a small number of products to start with?</p>  <p>Does using an SQL database make it easier when implementing a shopping cart?</p>  <p>I guess I just need to know how you would generally go about it so I know where to get started.</p>  <p>Thanks for your time.</p>
