<p>I have a quick question that's driving me insane and would appreciate the assistance.</p>  <p>On a live wordpress setup, how does accessing /wp-config.php from a browser result in a 403 error when you can access all other PHP files fine froma webbrowser? The config.php file has a chmod that permits public read AND there's no mention of it in the corresponding .htaccess.</p>  <p>Just very curious as to how it works. Thanks!</p>
