<p>I'm writing a Twitch app in C where the first time a user ran the program, the program would open up their default browser and direct them to the Twitch authorization website.  They would log in and authorize my app.  After they click "authorize", Twitch redirects and in the redirected URL is a code-token needed for future GETs and POSTs from the API for that specific user.  Is it possible to launch the browser and load the website and then return the redirected URL all through C?</p>
