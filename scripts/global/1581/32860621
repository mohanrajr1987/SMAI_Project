<p>I'm checking whether or not the username and email the user has entered is taken. Everything works fine; if it's already in use it doesn't register the account and informs the user, but if it's not taken the account is made, however, I get the warning message regardless.</p>  <p>This is where the error is coming from, but based off the tutorials I have been using this code should work fine:</p>  <pre><code>$sql = "SELECT Username, Email FROM users WHERE Username = $username AND Email = $email"; $result = $conn-&gt;query($sql);  if ($result-&gt;num_rows = 0) </code></pre>
