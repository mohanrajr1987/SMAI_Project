<p>I have some code to do a simple mysqli procedural INSERT INTO my DB. It looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>$conn2 = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname_name); // Check connection if (!$conn2) {     die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error()); }  // prepare and bind $stmt2 = $conn2-&gt;prepare("INSERT INTO db_name (resource_owner, resource_title, resource_text_intro, resource_active) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"); $stmt2-&gt;bind_param("issi", $resource_owner, $resource_title, $introduction, $resource_active);  // set parameters and execute $resource_title = $_POST['resource_title']; $introduction = $_POST['introduction']; $resource_active = 0;  $stmt2-&gt;execute(); </code></pre>  <p>For some reason that I cannot see, this is not inserting into the DB, nor am I getting any error messages. My form simply loops back to the form page (I have it set to redirect to a new page after an insert). I have verified that the $_POST['submit'] is in fact working, so this section of the script is not being skipped over. </p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p>
