<p>I followed one link here, and modified my code accordingly. What I am trying to do achieve is for example a table name media_ids contains 45 rows(which is dyanamic), I want to divide the no of rows in a group of 10 rows minimum (in my case four groups of 10 rows and 1 group of 5) and execute code of each group per hour.</p>  <p>For example from select record from id 1 to 10 then second hour from 11 to 20 and so on unless fetches the last record and start again from id 1.</p>  <p>I added a tracker, which check whats the current limit and proceed.But its giving me the required result what I am trying to achieve.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php require('inc/dbConnect.php');  $lastPointerq = "select tracker from media_tracker"; $lastPointerResult = mysqli_query($con, $lastPointerq); $lastPointerRes = mysqli_fetch_row($lastPointerResult); $lastPointer = $lastPointerRes[0]; $lastPointer10=$lastPointer+10;  $currentMediaQuery = "select * from media_ids where id &gt; ".$lastPointer." limit ".$lastPointer.",".$lastPointer10."";  $mediaQuery = mysqli_query($con, $currentMediaQuery);  if (mysqli_num_rows($mediaQuery) &gt; 0) {     while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($mediaQuery)) {        // do stuffâ€¦       echo $id=$row['id']."&lt;br&gt;";     } }  else {echo "0";}  if ($lastPointer + 10 &gt; 40) {     $lastPointer = 1; } else {     $lastPointer += 10; }  mysqli_query($con, "update media_tracker set tracker = $lastPointer"); ?&gt; </code></pre>
