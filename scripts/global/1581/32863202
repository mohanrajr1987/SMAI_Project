<p>I am running a query against a database but mysqli always seems to be missing a row. below is the code, can someone please advise:</p>  <pre><code>conn = new mysqli($server,$source,$user,$password); mysqli_set_charset($conn); $result = $conn-&gt;query("select this,that from my_table"); while($data = $result&gt;fetch_assoc()) {     /// do stuff } </code></pre>  <p>thanks in advance!</p>
