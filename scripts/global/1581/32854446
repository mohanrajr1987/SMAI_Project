<p>I have this Mysql database table (that stores some settings for my app):</p>  <pre><code>Table name: settings  id    param_name    param_value -------------------------------- 1     ringtone      12.mp3 2     user          nick 3     email         nick@example.com 4     location      Athens, Greece 5     phone         0123456789 6     time_offset   GMT+3 </code></pre>  <p>The "id" column is just auto-incremental and gets value from mysql.</p>  <p>The column "param_name" has some initial values (such as: ringtone, user ...etc)</p>  <p>The column "param_value" takes it's values dynamically from a "settings" form so that each parameter has it's unique value.</p>  <p>I want to select these all rows with one query and turn each one of them into a variable such as:</p>  <pre><code>$this_ringtone = "12.mp3"; $this_user = "nick"; $this_email = "nick@example.com"; $this_location = "Athens, Greece"; $this_phone = "0123456789"; $this_time_offset = "GMT+3"; </code></pre>  <p>I can do that with multiple queries but since the rows are actually a lot more, I would prefer a single mysqli query.</p>
