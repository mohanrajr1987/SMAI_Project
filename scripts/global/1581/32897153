<p>So my problem is that we are trying to set up a WordPress site on a Windows server (2012) under IIS. I used WebPI to install PHP and used the PHP Manager to configure it. We have a database server at 10.0.0.x which runs both SQL Server and MySQL. We got it all set up, but WordPress doesn't connect. We get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Access denied for user 'user'@'ip-10-0-0-x.x.compute.internal' (using password: YES)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried this:</p>  <pre><code>$link = mysqli_connect(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS) or die(mysqli_connect_error()); </code></pre>  <p>I also tried that with the <code>mysql_connect</code> extension with the same results. So then I tried this:</p>  <pre><code>$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=10.0.0.x;dbname=DB_NAME', 'DB_USER', 'DB_PASS'); $statement = $pdo-&gt;query("SELECT user_login FROM wp_users WHERE ID = 1"); $row = $statement-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); echo htmlentities($row['user_login']); </code></pre>  <p>And that worked perfectly. It connected, ran the query, and returned the value. MySQL Workbench was also able to connect. I was able to determine that WordPress is using <code>mysqli</code> with a fallback to the <code>mysql</code> library. And that's probably why it's failing to connect. But what's the difference and why would it authenticate one but not the other?</p>  <p>MySQL Community version: 5.6</p>  <p>PHP 5.3 (initially tried 5.6)</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Because the question came up, I realize WordPress works. That's not the question. The MySQL user is set up as 'user'@'%'. Obviously I can connect to that user on that server from that host, using PDO. My question is why can PDO connect while mysqli cannot?</p>
