<p>I am using joshcam/ PHP MySQLi class and currently having problem on inserting foreign character in the table.</p>  <p>I tried to update using rawQuery to identify if the problem lies with the class itself.</p>  <p>$db->rawQuery("UPDATE table SET fieldname=''龙岗区中心" WHERE . ..... ");</p>  <p>The query executes with no problem but it saves as ?????? in the table.</p>  <p>If i use mysql_query update on the same table , the characters insert in the table with no problem.</p>  <p>Has anyone experienced this? The charset is set as UTF-8.</p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>Regards</p>  <p>Ash</p>
