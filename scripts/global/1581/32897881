<p>Now that I know that one query will not be able to combine two tables from two different mysql databases, Is it possible to create multiple queries to  display results in PHP after combining two tables from two mysql databases? I have two mysql databases that have different passwords.  I would like to display the results after I join two tables: one from each database.  This is what I have thus far:</p>  <pre><code>$connectdb1 = mysqli_connect("localhost", "dblogin1", "pswd1", "db1"); $connectdb2 = mysqli_connect("localhost", "dblogin2", "pswd2", "db2");  $sorc815sql = "SELECT * FROM db1.myaudtable LEFT JOIN db2.contacttable ON myaudtable.myAudContactID=contacttable.contactID";  $sorc815res = mysqli_query($sorc815sql); echo '&lt;br&gt;$sv815res='.$sorc815res; </code></pre>  <p>I do get an error, "Warning: mysqli_query() expects at least 2 parameters, 1 given in (file location) on line 31"</p>
