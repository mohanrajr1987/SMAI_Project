<p>Having a bit of an issue with LEFT JOIN in a Mysqli statement. I have two tables, one that has single entries for various events. The second table has all the images for that event. </p>  <p><strong>What I want to get:</strong> I want to get a single return for the last 8 events with an image count for that event and the last image uploaded for the event.</p>  <p><strong>The problem:</strong> A simple LEFT JOIN would be great for this, however that's a hitch... sometimes there's multiple days for these events. So the one thing that connects the two tables together is the FOLDER field. But, the can also differ if there's more than one day. This makes match up the event to the images a bit tougher. </p>  <p><strong>Visual example:</strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Table: Events</em></strong></p>  <pre><code>Title      Folder          Days    Added ------------------------------------------- Event1     2015-EventA     1       20151001 Event2     2015-EventB     2       20150901 Event3     2015-EventC     3       20150801 </code></pre>  <p><strong><em>Table: Images</em></strong></p>  <pre><code>File         Folder             Date --------------------------------------- imgA1.jpg    2015-EventA        20150930 imgA2.jpg    2015-EventA        20151001 imgB1.jpg    2015-EventB-1      20150910 imgB2.jpg    2015-EventB-2      20150901 imgC1.jpg    2015-EventC-1      20150910 imgC2.jpg    2015-EventC-2      20151001 imgC3.jpg    2015-EventC-2      20150930 imgC4.jpg    2015-EventC-3      20150927 </code></pre>  <p><strong>Result I'm looking for (remember it's picking the last uploaded image for that event):</strong></p>  <pre><code>Title      Folder          Days     File         IMGCount     IMGFolder ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Event 1    2015-EventA     1        imgA2.jpg    2            2015-EventA Event 2    2015-EventB     2        imgB1.jpg    2            2015-EventB-1  Event 3    2015-EventC     3        imgC2.jpg    4            2015-EventC-2 </code></pre>  <p><strong>What I've tried:</strong></p>  <pre><code>SELECT t1.*, t2.IMGCount, t2.File, T2.Folder AS IMGFolder  FROM Events as t1  LEFT JOIN (select count(File) AS IMGCount, Folder, File          FROM Images GROUP BY Folder ORDER BY Date DESC LIMIT 8) AS t2 on t1.Folder LIKE t2.Folder OR t1.Folder LIKE t2.Folder || '-1' OR t1.Folder LIKE t2.Folder || '-2' OR t1.Folder LIKE t2.Folder || '-3' OR t1.Folder LIKE t2.Folder || '-4'    ORDER BY Added DESC LIMIT 8 </code></pre>  <p>This ALMOST works... but the Event table repeats the first Event's information for all the matches... so I get this which has correct Image table info, but repeated Event:</p>  <pre><code>Title      Folder          Days     File         IMGCount     IMGFolder ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Event 1    2015-EventA     1        imgA2.jpg    2            2015-EventA Event 1    2015-EventA     1        imgB1.jpg    2            2015-EventB-1  Event 1    2015-EventA     1        imgC2.jpg    4            2015-EventC-2 </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong? </p>
