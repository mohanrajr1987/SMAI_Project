<p>I' am using <a href="https://github.com/joshcam/PHP-MySQLi-Database-Class" rel="nofollow">MySQLI Wrapper</a> as stated in the <a href="https://github.com/joshcam/PHP-MySQLi-Database-Class#running-raw-sql-queries" rel="nofollow">docs</a> about running rawQuery. Since it doesn't have any function to search database I had write my own. Below is the code that am using.</p>  <pre><code>$songs = $db-&gt;ObjectBuilder()-&gt;rawQuery('SELECT * FROM songs WHERE song_name LIKE ?', array('%test%')); </code></pre>  <p>The query returns empty results, yes there are data in the database which should match the search keyword. Any idea what am I doing wrong in the Query?</p>
