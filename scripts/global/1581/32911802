<p>What is the syntax for <code>SELECT FROM WHERE</code> in MYSQLI as the roles of old MYSQL? I used following but it did not worked and error message was to check correct syntax of above query with mysql version. Note my mysql version is 5.6.13.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php     $result=mysqli_query($cn, "SELECT id FROM mytable WHERE data=5"); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I used id as column in from I want to get data and data=5 show that there is data equal to this in another column of that table.</p>
