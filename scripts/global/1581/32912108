<p>I know this place is for uploading code that may need some help although I hope you won't mind helping as I'm not sure where to really start with this code. You are the experts and I am a novice requiring help with future coding. If there is a section aimed at this kind of thing, I will be happy to repost.</p>  <p>Here is the situation:</p>  <p>I am starting work on an advanced admin backend panel for my staff, an idea I currently have is to use a MySQLi database to create the staff rota, to be displayed in a simple calendar like table on the aPanel. </p>  <p>Now, the advanced part is the staff member will be able to click <code>"Clock In"</code> or <code>"Clock Out"</code> during the times/days they are issued on the rota.</p>  <p>The system will NOT let the staff member <code>Clock In</code>, unless they are on the rota for that time of day. I will then have access to a management section of the panel allowing me to view the amount of hours the staff member has been clocked in for for if they have missed days, or are late, etc... And pay them for recorded clocked in hours. </p>  <p>Maybe some added features would be that they are clocked out automatically at the end of their shift or the system would record overtime and such?</p>  <p>I have no idea how I would go about creating such system or if it is actually possible so if anybody may have any advice/tips/examples for such idea I would appreciate any help! </p>  <p>All the best! </p>
