<p>I want to display posts on my main page in columns. I used a method by calling blogs by few categories in one column and other categories in other column but now I think it's not a good idea to limit certain categories to one column. So how to call posts in different columns. I can create columns using css/flexboxes very well but just don't know how to get posts in different columns, suppose if i am using simple css with a container and three columns inside it <code>echo</code>ing in columns separately for the single query that gets posts from database will show same identical posts in all columns. So how to get different posts in different columns.      </p>  <p>this is how I call posts from db: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $query = "SELECT * FROM blogs INNER JOIN categories  ON categories.category_id=blogs.category_id ORDER BY blogs_id desc LIMIT 2"; $result = mysqli_query($con,$query); $rowCount = mysqli_num_rows($result); if($rowCount &gt; 0){ while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {  $blogs_id = $row['blogs_id']; $title = $row['title']; $body = $row['body'];  echo "$title"; ?&gt;         </code></pre>
