<p>I want to display only the item that not been recorded yet. I use this statement to insert the data into database, the 'idbarang' is from checkbox. 1 user can only receive 1 time only.</p>  <p>view :</p>  <pre><code> SELECT DISTINCT idbarang, nama, jumlah FROM barang  WHERE idbarang  NOT IN(SELECT idbarang FROM brgpljr WHERE id_pljr='$nopen'); </code></pre>  <p>insert :</p>  <pre><code>    INSERT INTO brgpljr (id, id_pljr, idbarang) VALUES  (NULL, '$nopen', '$idBrg') ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE idbarang='$idBrg'; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is if the user does not receive all of the item, i cant insert the one that he not receive yet. My query will make the item that not yet recorded is inserted and discard the others and vice versa.</p>
