<p>Attached the table sample. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kGTWF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kGTWF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Every hour I want to get the most recent items added to my table.  The table is populated from another source, and I need to track what the last id I received was and get all new items added since.</p>  <pre><code>$check5 = "select * from media_ids"; $rs5 = mysqli_query($con,$check5); if(mysqli_num_rows($rs5)==1) { $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($rs5); $media_id=$row['media_id']; }  // execute query </code></pre>
