<p>I would like to know what is the best way to <strong>split</strong> the <strong>data</strong> after a <strong>select all</strong> in a database with <strong>mysqli</strong> - please don't answer to add a where clause, because I can't in that situation, I NEED to manage data AFTER the query -.<br> So, I want to split the data in the <strong>mysqli_fetch_assoc</strong>.<br> What is the best method ? Is there a function to do that ? I need to do it manually with a for ? Is there an other easy solution to do it properly ?</p>  <p>Thanks for the help.</p>  <p>My code : (just an exemple, not the real code)</p>  <pre><code>$select = "SELECT * FROM myTable"; $exec = mysqli_query($db, $select); $rows = mysqli_fetch_assoc($exec); // Now with a do while() I can display all the data // But I want to display only 10 rows for exemple // -&gt; What is the best solution to split my data here ? &lt;- do{     // some html code here }  while($rows = mysqli_fetch_assoc($exec)) </code></pre>
