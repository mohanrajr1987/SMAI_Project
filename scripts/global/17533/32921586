<p>I have implemented an NSSplitView which essentially keeps a table on the left of the window like a sidebar, and a webView on the right. The user clicks the different rows of the table to load a url in the WebView.</p>  <p>My issue is that when I run the app, the divider moves to the right edge of the width of the left view and the window size does not increase to accomodate the webView. At first I thought the webView was just not working, until I discovered I was able to drag the divider to the left which revealed the webView.</p>  <p>It's my understanding that the auto layout constraints setup within the view itself is how the split view resizes, however I create the webView programatically via a subclassed view controller rather than on a storyboard or xib. As a test, I tried placing a button and applying width constraints but it had no affect, the webView is still hidden, essentially with a width of 0 points and is only able to be revealed by dragging the split view divider to the left.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any suggestions how I can go about resolving this issue?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
