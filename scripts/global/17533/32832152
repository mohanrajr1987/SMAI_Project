<p>Alright, here is the deal.</p>  <p>I have a UINavigationController which has a root VC. From this root VC, you can show another VC, and from there, another, and from there, another.</p>  <p>The problem is that I'm running into what I think is a bug in Xcode.</p>  <p>In the below image, you see a button in my rootVC navigationItem that I use to segue with Show to display the second VC. You can clearly see the Navigation Bar, but when I try to drag a UIBarButtonItem into it, I can't and the reason is because if you look at the menu on the left, you'll see that there isn't a Navigation Item to drag the button into!</p>  <p>If I instead use the segue Push to display the second VC, I get a navigationItem... but apparently Push is deprecated.</p>  <p>How do I mitigate this?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MeMdt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MeMdt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Edit: I guess I can just drag in a UINavigationItem into it... but I really don't know if I should. Would there be an empty UINavigationItem underneath that that I just don't see in storyboard but is actually there?</p>
