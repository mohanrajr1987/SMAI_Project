<p>I'm using an open source project from GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/ezescaruli/ESTabBarController" rel="nofollow">ESTabBarController</a>. I downloaded the example project but the problem was that the developer was using Xib files for each view controller but for the app I'm developing I was using Main.storyboard I tried searching for other questions here and posted in the issues in the GitHub project and tried my best in Xcode to use storyboard instead of Xib but honestly nothing worked. Can anybody help me please?</p>  <p>This is probably my first question here and I'm a new iOS developer so I don't know if I'm dumb enough to ask this but I would really appreciate help. Thanks in advance.</p>
