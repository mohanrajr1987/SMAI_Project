<p>I have added two storyboards in my project. 1 is for iPhone and 1 is for iPad. I also added key in Info file with both storyboard names.</p>  <p>When I run the app in iPad it shows main storyboad instead of storyboardipad</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lOyg3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lOyg3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
