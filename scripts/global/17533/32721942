<p>I want to scale down the main view in my app (have the view centered but have the width and height get smaller so it appears it's disappearing), and I have two other containers that need to appear when a button is clicked which I have already coded. However, when I try to use self.view.frame to change the frame of the view that is the original view inside my storyboard controller it changes the frame of everything since the containers are added to this main view in my storyboard. Is there a way for me to scale down a single view inside this view controller. </p>  <p>Also the main view I'm trying to scale down contains the class I have set to the controller in the Storyboard.  Thanks in advance!</p>
