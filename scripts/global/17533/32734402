<p>I am trying to add a new WatckKit target to an old project. Yet when I do it and immediately trigger the Assistant Editor, and click the initial controller, no file is loaded and message "No Assistant Result" is shown. Of course if I manually select the file, then connecting the outlet produces errors. I tried deleting and reinserting the target several times, as well clear the derived folder, restart Xcode and also the Mac, but the situation remains the same. When I did the same thing on new project following some tutorials, I never had this problems. What might it be and how to fix it?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F1QyS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F1QyS.png" alt="Screenshot"></a></p>
