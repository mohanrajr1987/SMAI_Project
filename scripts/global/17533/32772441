<p>I'm attempting to build a view (iPhone only, portrait view only) using adaptive layout. It should all be on a single screen (ideally no scrolling). I've managed to get it working (reasonably) for the iPhone 5 - 6+. However, my issue comes with the 4s.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gcx59.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gcx59.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'd like, on the iPhone 4s to have the center image go away, which I thought I could use size classes, but it doesn't seem so for the various iPhones in portrait mode (only if I switch orientation).</p>  <p>Additionally, I'd like there to be more padding between all the elements on the 6+ while spacing remains the same on the 5 and 6.</p>
