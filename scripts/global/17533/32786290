<p>I have a storyboard with this situation;</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIlPT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIlPT.png" alt="My Storyboard"></a></p>  <p>The root view controller is a UISplitViewController with:</p>  <ul> <li>MASTER: a UITabBarController  <ul> <li>0 ->UINavigationController -> ...other ViewControllers</li> <li>1 ->UINavigationController -> ...other ViewControllers</li> </ul></li> <li>DETAIL: a UINavigationController -> a DetailViewControler</li> </ul>  <p>With this hierarchy the segue showDetail from last viewcontroller in master to the Navigation Controller in Detail doesn't work because the Detail is presented Modally in a Collapsed environment instead of presenting it with a push. I think this behavior comes from the Tab Bar Controller because it isn't a Container like a UINavigationController. In fact if i remove the tab bar and set a navigation as Master of Split View Controller it works like usual.</p>  <p>What can i do for using a tab bar like Master of Split View Controller and get the right behavior of showDetail segue in a collapsed environment?</p>  <p>P.S.: for right behavior i mean pushing the Detail in the Master Navigation Controller in a horizontal compact environment (iPhone 6 plus Portrait).       </p>
