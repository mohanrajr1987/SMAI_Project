<p>I've been studying swift for 3 weeks and I'm trying to use Xib files but i can't find nothing to truly answer my questions, so I decided to ask here hoping you guys can help me:</p>  <p>1- I want to create a Photo Gallery, I used a UICollectionViewCell with xib file and used the storyboard to insert there my Collection View and in the ViewController file I've put the Collection View methods (numberOfItemsInSection, etc..), I was thinking if that is the right way to do it.</p>  <p>2- I thought that I could create a Xib file for the UICollectionView and the UICollectionViewCell and connect then to the storyboard but already read that that was not possible somewhere in one of the StackOverflow questions so what is the best way to do it, the first way with the code in the View Controller?</p>  <p>3- What is the way for better performance, xib files or the code right in the storyboard class (ViewController.swift)?</p>  <p>Thanks for the help. </p>
