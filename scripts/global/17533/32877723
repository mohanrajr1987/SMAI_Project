<p>So I want to have an image that displays on the bottom half of my screen and then animate it to a smaller scale and have it attached to the top/right.  Sorry for the crude images, but this is basically what I want:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3ojL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3ojL.png" alt="Original Placement"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gTBgX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gTBgX.png" alt="Final Placement"></a></p>  <p>I thought I could do this by constraining the top, right, and aspect ratio of my view then just animate the change of my aspect ratio constraint.  Unfortunately, when I do this IB screams that I don't have a proper X value for my view, and when I animate the scale I just end up with my view shrunk vertically but still full width.</p>  <p>I hope this makes sense and someone can help me figure out how to make this happen.</p>
