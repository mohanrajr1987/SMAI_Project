<p>My iPhone only app has been rejected for the following reason provided by Apple:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>We noticed that your app did not run at iPhone resolution when reviewed on iPad running iOS 9, which is a violation of the App Store Review Guidelines. </p> </blockquote>  <p>I now understand that the iPad has its own iPhone simulator that you can run iPhone apps on. After initial debugging, I noticed that, when testing on the iPad Air (iOS 9.0), my iPhone 5 storyboard is being used in its own iPhone simulator.</p>  <p>This is how it looks (correctly) on the iPhone 5:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SMHyx.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/SMHyx.png</a></p>  <p>And this is how it looks (incorrectly) on the iPad:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2PHG4.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/2PHG4.png</a></p>  <p>Since the iPad is using my iPhone 5 storyboard, why isn't it scaling everything correctly? How do I fix this?</p>  <p>*****EDIT*****</p>  <p>I have discovered that I made a mistake when debugging and the iPad's iPhone simulator has a display height of 480, which is the size of an iPhone 4. My code below was causing my iPhone 6+ storyboard to be shown:</p>  <pre><code>CGSize result = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size;  //get the right storyboard for the device. if(result.height == 568) {     storyBoard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"iPhone5" bundle:nil];     NSLog(@"IPHONE 5 STORYBOARD!"); } else if(result.height == 667) {     storyBoard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"iPhone6" bundle:nil];     NSLog(@"IPHONE 6 STORYBOARD!"); } else //iPhone 6+ {     storyBoard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"iPhone6Plus" bundle:nil];     NSLog(@"IPHONE 6+ STORYBOARD!"); } </code></pre>  <p>However, I thought I made my app for only iPhone 5 and up by setting it to iOS 8 and up, meaning that I don't have an iPhone 4 storyboard. How do I solve this issue?</p>
