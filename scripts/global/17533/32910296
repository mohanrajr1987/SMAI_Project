<p>My UICollectionView works nicely in Storyboard's "width Any | height Any" size class (see below): <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2wGdT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2wGdT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However, when working in different size class configurations, the UICollectionViewCell's size does not seem to adapt in Storyboard: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYgtd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYgtd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I am unsure how to resolve this and continue to work on interfaces in Storyboard for the different size classes. Any help on why this is happening or how to fix it would be much appreciated.</p>
