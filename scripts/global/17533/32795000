<p>I am developing an application with iOS 9 based SDK , this is my first time I am working with Storyboards , I have 20 view controllers, each scene has Next / Previous buttons to go back and forward . I have a huge problem with going forward !. If I move from scene 1 to for example to scene 15 I received memory warning and then application crashes . I have searched and it seems there is method called <code>unwind segue</code> but it seems this is for going back ! it's something like <code>dissMiss</code> method .  </p>  <p>I connect each scene with line in Interface Builder :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qm81P.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qm81P.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Here is segue's setting :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LLmXk.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LLmXk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I would be grateful if you help me out . </p>  <p>EDITED :</p>  <p>I tried to present a view controller programmatically but result was the same ! .</p>  <pre><code>UIStoryboard *mainStoryboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Main" bundle:nil];     WhatIsDino *vc = (WhatIsDino*)[mainStoryboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"WID"];     [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil]; </code></pre>
