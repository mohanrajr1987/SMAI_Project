<p>So I have an application that builds the UI from a storyboard, and I have this ViewController that needs to render both a UITableView and UICollectionView within the same scene. </p>  <p>So I basically created a regular UIViewController that that contains both a UITableView and a UICollectionView. The views are obviously set within the storyboard. The scene ViewController then contain a both UICollectionViewController and a UITableViewController.</p>  <p>I went this way cause this specific collectionView is a reuse from a very similar collection view from another place in the app. It works perfectly fine there, however, here nothing happens and the view doesn't appear there on run time. The tableView works just fine, and from what I've found so should the UICollectionView, but obviously I'm missing something. Is there something extra that a regular UIViewController needs to have (a method or a property) so that it will display the UICollectionView? Obviously I'm missing something since everything I've found about this indicates that it is possible to do it this way. Edit: Relevant Code in viewDidLoad: </p>  <pre><code>self.productsCollectionViewController = [[ContentPageCollectionViewController alloc] init]; self.productsCollectionViewController.collectionView = self.collectionView; [self.collectionView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor cyanColor]]; [self.productsCollectionViewController setSectionSizes:@[[NSNumber numberWithInteger:7]]];  self.filtersTableViewController = [[ProductsFilterTableViewController alloc] init]; self.filtersTableViewController.tableView = self.tableView; [self.tableView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor yellowColor]]; </code></pre>
