<p>I have tried to code the fortran file and I don't what is wrong with the file exactly. Below is my code</p>  <pre><code>  SUBROUTINE DISP(U,KSTEP,KINC,TIME,NODE,NOEL,JDOF,COORDS)     INCLUDE 'ABA_PARAM.INC'     INTEGER,PARAMETER::iwp=SELECTED_REAL_KIND(15)   REAL(iwp),INTENT(OUT)::U(1)      REAL,DIMENSION(1:304,1:3)::A  ! Matrix with dimension 304 x 3   REAL :: x, y, z   INTEGER :: i,j,k    OPEN(UNIT = 1, FILE = "Pressure_SAVAN_100Hz.txt",FORM = "FORMATTED", STATUS = "OLD", ACTION = "READ") !text file which is a 304 x 3 Matrix            DO i=1,UBOUND(A,1)    READ(UNIT=7, FMT=*)x,y,z    A(i,1) = x    A(i,2) = y            !real part of the value    A(i,3) = z            !complex part of the value         ENDDO      DO j = 1, UBOUND(A,1)    IF (NODE.EQ.A(j,1)) THEN    IF(JDOF.EQ.1) THEN       U(j) = A(j,2)     ENDIF    ENDIF     ENDDO     END </code></pre>  <p>My text file looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>1,0.020141,3.1217  2,0.096111,3.1203  3,0.23753,3.1128  4,0.45527,3.0884  5,0.75772,3.0285  6,1.1475,2.9033  7,1.6152,2.6715 </code></pre>
