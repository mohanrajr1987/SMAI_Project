<p>I have written s subroutine for a commercial software which is compiled by Intel Fortran so that the code has been written in Fortran. the subroutine is compiled by itself without any problem, but when I link it to the main software I get some strange results.</p>  <p>The most interesting and surprising event is:</p>  <p>When I put a <code>write</code> statement in the subroutine I get different results than there is no <code>write</code> statement within it  and also by changing the place of this statement, the results are changed. I have never seen that the <code>write</code> statement can affect the results. It would be really appreciated if someone give me an idea?</p>
