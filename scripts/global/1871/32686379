<p>My code </p>  <pre><code>program k do i=1,100 call subroutine1 end do other parts............ return end </code></pre>  <p>In the subroutine1, I have allocated a large number of arrays and I know I have to deallocate them at the end of subroutine1. Due to the large number of arrays I've allocated, is it possible to deallocate all by using something like deallocate(all) in fortran to deallocate all the arrays?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>
