<p>The namelist read/write feature in Fortran is extremely convenient, but in attempting to make my own custom namelist-esque read/write feature. I have become very confused as to how it works. As far as I can find there is no way in Fortran to assign a value to a variable using a string as the variable name. Something like</p>  <pre><code>character*(30) :: color write("color", '(A)') "blue" </code></pre>  <p>and yet that is the only way I can think of the namelist feature working. So how does it?</p>
