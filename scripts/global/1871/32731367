<p>I want to use the <strong>pFUnit</strong> Fortran Unit Testing Framework with <strong>vim</strong>. The tests are usually written in a file with the ending <code>.pf</code>, and they use mostly Fortran 95 syntax, except that they have unittesting specific keywords (like <code>@test</code> and <code>@assertEqual</code>)</p>  <p>What is the easiest way to extend the fortran syntax highlighting in <strong>vim</strong> to also mark these special words only in files with the <code>.pf</code> extension?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Example Unit Test:</p>  <pre><code>@test subroutine test_to_lower_all_A()     use pfunit_mod     use mod_str_tools, only: to_lower     @assertEqual("aaa", to_lower("AAA")) end subroutine </code></pre>
