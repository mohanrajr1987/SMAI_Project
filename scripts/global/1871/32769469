<p>I am trying to integrate a Matlab program I wrote into some Fortran code. I tried to follow the example Mathworks <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/call-matlab-functions-from-fortran-applications.html" rel="nofollow">provides</a>. But I can't get it to compile because I can't find the header files it requests.</p>  <p>Does anyone know of an example of someone getting it to work on Linux using an Intel compiler. I think that might be part of the problem because Matlab only supports GNU Fortran on Linux.</p>  <p>And I realize this is a simple question, I just don't understand how to do anything in compiling more complicated than including multiple files with defined paths.</p>
