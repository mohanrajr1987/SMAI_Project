<p>I'm maintaining a project that uses a number of Python libraries such as <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code>, and <code>netcdf4</code> which have dependencies such as libhdf5, ATLAS, LAPACK, etc.  I have previously installed these libraries via my system package manager prior to installing using pip.  Now it is desired to list all the dependencies required, including C/Fortran dependencies. (Python is pretty easy with <code>pip freeze</code> and <code>pipdeptree</code>, of course)  Is there any way to show which linked C/Fortran libraries are being used?  Failing that, is there any way to show build options for the Python libraries using C dependencies?</p>  <p>EDIT: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9000164/how-to-check-blas-lapack-linkage-in-numpy-scipy">this answer</a>  details how to do this for <code>numpy</code> and perhaps other libraries with C dependencies through <code>ldd</code>.  What's the recommended approach across the board?</p>
