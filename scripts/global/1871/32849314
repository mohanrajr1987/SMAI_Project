<p>I'm using a VS2010 C++/Intel Fortran XE2011 mixed environment on Windows 7.</p>  <p>I have a VS2010 Solution with both C++ and Fortran Projects. In the C++ Projects, the project file successfully resolves VS Environment variables, such as $(Platform) and $(ProjectDir). However, the Fortran project does not successfully resolves those and through's compilation errors.</p>  <p>A colleague of mine sitting next to me doesn't have any issue with the exact same Solution/Project files - so we think it has to do with Installation or Software Settings, but we've found nothing.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
