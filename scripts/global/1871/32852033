<p>I am compiling a program (that I did not write) using gfortran. The make file specified f77 as the compiler, but I do not have it.</p>  <p>I have run into an error related to the OPEN command.</p>  <pre><code>Error: The STATUS specified in OPEN statement at (1) is 'NEW' and no FILE specifier is present </code></pre>  <p>I looked into Fortran 77 OPEN, and according to the Oracle language reference there is a default behaviour when 'FILE=name' is not specified.</p>  <p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/805-4939/6j4m0vnaf/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/805-4939/6j4m0vnaf/index.html</a></p>  <p>'NEW' -- The file doesn't exist (existence is an error). If 'FILE=name' is not specified, then a file named 'fort.n' is opened, where n is the specified logical unit.</p>  <p>Is there a way to force the compiler to use the language specified default behaviour. Alternatively, can I modify the code to perform the expected default behaviour?</p>
