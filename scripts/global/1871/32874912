<p>I can write a FORTRAN function to find an available file unit, but I was certain there was already an intrinsic.  But if there is, I can't find anything about it.  Is there such a thing or am I dreaming?</p>  <p>UPDATE: Apologies for the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7876075/getting-free-unit-number-in-fortran">duplicate</a>.  Did a search, but it didn't show up.</p>
