<p>I am just starting to learn fortran and I have made a simple program, implementing Eulers method. I noticed that the time used by the <code>do</code> loop is fairly similar to, for example, the same program in Matlab.</p>  <p>In my Fortran program, I had a write to a file inside this <code>do</code> loop. When I removed it the speed drastically improved, as expected. Then I added a second <code>do</code> loop, where I place the writing and measured the time required by both loops combined: </p>  <pre><code>open(unit=1, file='data.dat') write(1,*) t(1),' ', y(1) ! Calculating call cpu_time(start) do i = 2,n     t(i) = t(i-1) + dt     y(i) = y(i-1) + dt*(t(i-1)*(y(i-1)))     !write(1,*) t(i),' ', y(i) end do call cpu_time(finish) print  '("Time = ",f7.5," seconds.")',finish-start call cpu_time(start) do i = 2,n     write(1,*) t(i),' ',y(i) end do  call cpu_time(finish) print  '("Time = ",f7.5," seconds.")',finish-start </code></pre>  <p>The time for a given <code>n</code> would take approximately 10-15 times longer on the last <code>do</code> loop compared to the first one.</p>  <p>So, my question is, is there a better way to write my data to a file?</p>
