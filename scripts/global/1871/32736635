<p>I am calling one subroutine and its showing me syntax error. I am using intel visual fortran with Visual studio. But before this I was running with compaq vidual fortran and it was running successfully. This is the line of code where the syntax error is: </p>  <pre><code>call XLIMEX(n,Fcn,Jacobian,t_Begin,t_End,y,ys,rTol,aTol,h,Iopt, &amp;       Ropt,IPos,IFail) </code></pre>  <p>I started from column 7 and end before column 77, how can I solve this issue? Thanks</p>
