<p>I have a custom ViewGroup that contains an ImageView and a few other TextViews that display white text on the image. I would like to draw ONE dark rectangle under all the textviews to improve the contrast. </p>  <p>To accomplish this, in the custom ViewGroup's onLayout, I compute the smallest rectangle that contain all of the TextViews. Now, I have no idea how to draw the rectangle on top of the first child (the image), but below the other children, the TextViews. So I would like to draw the children in the order:</p>  <ol> <li>ImageView (first child)</li> <li>Computed dark Rect</li> <li>TextViews (all other children)</li> </ol>  <p>I tried overriding dispatchDraw() and then after the call to super.dispatchDraw(canvas), I drew the rectangle. But that obviously put the rectangle over the TextViews.</p>  <p>I would appreciate any help. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
