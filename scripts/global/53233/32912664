<p>So I'm trying to make an app widget and display a profile picture there which should look like a circular <code>ImageView</code>. <strong>normally I'd just use a circular <code>ImageView</code> library, but for app widgets you can't extend views (so only vanilla <code>ImageView</code>) and it has to work with <code>RemoteViews</code></strong></p>  <p>So I'm playing around with the idea of using a <code>Drawable</code> to overlay/underlay to achieve this effect. I tried gusridd's solution from here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23464707/display-fb-profile-pic-in-circular-image-view-in-application">Display FB profile pic in circular image view in Application</a>, but the background which my profile picture sits on is also an image, and this just makes it a white square with a circlular image inside :(</p>  <p>edit: please read bolded portion before answering :X</p>
