<p>I am looking for height animation for <code>RelativeLayout</code>. Normally it should be starting from base value to the height of the layout. I was trying to write with <a href="https://github.com/2359media/EasyAndroidAnimations" rel="nofollow">EasyAndroidAnimation</a> library. But could not succeed. Below code is attached. It is bouncing up from the base. I need something smooth.</p>  <pre><code>new BounceAnimation(this.LayoutGraph)            .setBounceDistance(50)     .setNumOfBounces(5)     .setDuration(500)     .animate(); </code></pre>  <p>Also I am looking for something easy like this as I have to use the approach for many layouts: </p>  <pre><code>layout.startfrom(basevalue) layout.to(height of the layout) layout.animate() </code></pre>  <p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
