<p>I want to achieve the following:</p>  <ul> <li>a picture, as a background, which resize according to the screen size</li> <li>I want to put button on top of this picture, while maintaining a proportional position to the picture width and height.</li> </ul>  <p>See the example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3NF2z.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3NF2z.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The background is an image with the fill_parent settings for width/height.The yellow squares are buttons on top of this picture.</p>  <p>So, how can I keep the button on the exact same position on top of the picture with different screen size, using relative layout (or others layout)</p>
