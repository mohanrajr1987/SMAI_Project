<p>I am making a music app that has SlidingTab layout with viewpager. I have included a footer at the bottom of the main activity layout (just like Google play music). Now each of those viewpager fragments contain lists or grids. On clicking each grid/list item (say music album/genre/artist etc) it starts a new activity that displays the details of the grid item(number of songs etc). But I want this new activity to be placed above the footer and I don't want to include a footer in each activity.</p>  <p>Should I replace activity with fragment, if yes, how?</p>  <p>Please see this image to get an idea of what I intent to do <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fgL0u.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/fgL0u.png</a></p>  <p>My question is should the green section screen be a fragment? If yes, how do I launch it? </p>
