<p>When i use IronPython together with WPF-Binding, it throws some binding errors on startup. For example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pH3kt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pH3kt.png" alt="Binding Error"></a></p>  <p>I try to get rid of the errors with the help of <code>@clrtype returns, accepts</code> but this does not help. Did I some thing else wrong?</p>  <p>P.S. the binding works, but i want to eleminate the errors.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
