<p>I have a Windows 2008 R2 Server and I'm looking for the easiest method to backup the Bindings for the server. I have a whole ton of bindings for one particular IIS "website" and need to find a way to back those up and be able to restore them in case of server crash or migrating to another server.</p>  <p>How can this be done?</p>  <p>I can grab a list from the Advanced Properties, but its read only, so I'd have to reset them up one at a time.</p>  <p>Any ideas? It doesn't have to be a daily systematic backup process, but I'd feel more comfortable knowing that I could get those in a new server quickly.</p>  <p>I've seen references to the APPCMD, but haven't yet seen how that can export that complete list of bindings nor import.</p>  <p>Sorry, not experienced in this. Thanks!</p>
