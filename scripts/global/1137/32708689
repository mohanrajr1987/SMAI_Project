<p>I am developing an application with ADF framework.<br> I have an <code>ADF table</code> and in one of the columns of this table I have a textbox where I am using <code>Page Definition Variable</code> to populate its value.</p>  <p>But as I have noticed that the <code>Page Definition Variable</code> value is same for all rows in a column. I want to change this and access the different <code>Page Definition Variable</code> for some rows.</p>  <p>Please help me to resolve this issue.</p>
