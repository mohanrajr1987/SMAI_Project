<p>I'm trying to set a tooltip inside a label to a binding:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Label Content="x"  ToolTip="{Binding ElementName=_this, Path=date, StringFormat=Date: {0:G}}" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However this doesn't work (i.e. I only get the date without the string "Date: " - e.g. "1/1/2015 15:38") apparently because the ToolTip type is object. I've tried several remedies such as 1) putting the binding inside a TextBlock inside a tooltip inside a label.tooltip inside the label; 2) putting a TextBlock inside a label.tooltip with the binding (and several others); All of which do not work.</p>  <p>Is there any simple way of achieving what I want? (I don't mind using converters as long as 1) no external library is involved 2) there is nothing in the code behind - I want all the display code to be in XAML)</p>
