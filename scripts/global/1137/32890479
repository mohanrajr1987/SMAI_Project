<p>I have a <code>javax.net.SSLSocket</code> wich I initialise doing the following:</p>  <pre><code>SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault(); SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory.createSocket(host, hostPort, InetAddress.getByName(localAddress), localPort); sslSocket.startHandshake(); </code></pre>  <p>and my client connects to the server no problem.  When I close the connection <code>sslSocket.close()</code> and I try to initialise a new socket using the same local address and the same host address but different host port and different local port the connection is refused and I get <code>java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused</code>:</p>  <pre><code>SSLSocket sslSocket2 = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory.createSocket(host, hostPort2, InetAddress.getByName(localAddress), localPort2); sslSocket2.startHandshake(); </code></pre>  <p>What is weird is that when I try to reinitialise the new socket without binding it to my local address and port then it works fine:</p>  <pre><code>SSLSocket sslSocket2 = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory.createSocket(host, port2); </code></pre>  <p>anyone have any idea what is going on?</p>
