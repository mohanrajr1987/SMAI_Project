<p>I have a textView in my app , which has a link to a URL. </p>  <p>Below is the code :</p>  <p><strong>textView.setText(Html.fromHtml("&lt;\a href=\"<a href="https://example.com" rel="nofollow">https://example.com</a>\">Sign up now.")); enroll.setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance());</strong></p>  <p>When I turn on TalkBack for accessibility, this does not seem to work. However, I found out that it works well if I put a longer text , for example "Sign Up now bla bla bla". </p>  <p>What could be the issue ?</p>
