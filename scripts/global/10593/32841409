<p>I have created a razor flow dashboard. Within this I have been tasked to set up a link section at the top. To do this I have created a TableComponent called LinksTable. as below see the creation of the table: </p>  <pre><code>var LinksTable = new TableComponent(); LinksTable.setCaption("Links"); LinksTable.setDimensions(6, 4); LinksTable.addColumn('Name', 'Name'); LinksTable.addColumn('Link', 'Link'); addLinks(LinksTable, "Test", "http://www.google.co.uk"); addLinks(LinksTable, "Administrator Page", "Insert Link");  db.addComponent(LinksTable); </code></pre>  <p>This table then calls the addLinks function to then add the information. This method is below: </p>  <p>function addLinks(Table, Name, URL) {</p>  <pre><code>    Table.addRow({ Name: Name, Link: URL });   }  </code></pre>  <p>this Method currently shows a test link with the URL of google. What I would like to do is be able to link these events directly off with an OnClick. Is there a good way to do this? </p>  <p>I would like to keep the RazorFlow table if at all possible. </p>
