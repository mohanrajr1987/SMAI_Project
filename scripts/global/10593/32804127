<p>Essentially, I'm trying to take the line:</p>  <p>Google</p>  <p><a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a> (unlinked)</p>  <p>and make it:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a></p>  <p>While this shouldn't be super hard to do in HTML, when I'm trying to do it for a regular document, I'm running into problems. I'm trying to get through it in C++ or Python, but I'm not easily finding how to create links. Obviously Ctrl-K works when actually manually doing the task, but how to actually insert this task in code is proving harder than I had at first imagined.</p>
