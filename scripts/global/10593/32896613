<p>I need help landing on a certain id or class (on another page) once clicking a link. Once clicking on a link on a page, the user lands on another page on a specific part of that new page on a specific id or class.</p>  <p>I understand this can be done by the pixel screen but can it be done to land user on the element?</p>
