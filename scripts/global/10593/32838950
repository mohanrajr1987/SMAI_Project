<p>I am trying to create a set of icons in svg that have some hover effects in them. I then have each of these icons wrapped in an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> but when the page is loaded, the icons are not clickable, but do show their hover effects. </p>  <p>I've tried numerous fixes such as appending an absolutely positioned :before with height and width and transparent background, which creates a clickable area but the icon itself then loses the interactivity. I've also tried using the svg in <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> which again allows it to be clicked but loses the interactivity of it.</p>  <p>This is the code set up I am using:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="/batteries" class="svg-link"&gt;     &lt;object type="image/svg+xml" class="svg-icon" data="{{ asset('img/icons/servicing/batteries-car-active.svg') }}"&gt;     &lt;/object&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The hover effects are in the svg file itself.</p>
