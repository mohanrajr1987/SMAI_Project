<p>Eclipse 4.5 freezes for a very long time (about 15 minutes or even more) when I select a directory to project import. It is an Android project (which is probably not important), but there are many soft file system links in the jni directories because we use quite complicated ndk build. It seems Eclipse scans all the subdirectories and tries to find list of all possible projects in all the subtree (including soft links).</p>  <p>Is there any nice solution for this?</p>  <p>Anyway it must be a bug in the Eclipse, well written program should not block the main thread by an io operation...</p>
