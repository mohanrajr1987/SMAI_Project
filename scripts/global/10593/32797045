<p>I have added an overlay dialog box to my homepage.  When I click on the  tag the dialog box becomes visible. </p>  <p>The problem now is that when I close the dialog box  the link is disabled for clicking for about 7 seconds.  After doing nothing or clicking around it becomes enabled again. </p>  <p>I have created that <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/hypgrrg5/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a> of my source code.</p>  <p>The Css of the overlay dialog looks like that:</p>  <pre><code>.overlay {   position: absolute;   top: 0;   bottom: 0;   left: 0;   right: 0;   background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);   transition: opacity 500ms;   visibility: hidden;   opacity: 0;   z-index: 20;  } .overlay:target {   visibility: visible;   opacity: 1; }  .popup {   margin: 70px auto;   padding: 20px;   background: #fff;   color: #000;   text-align:left;   border-radius: 5px;   width: 80%;   height: 80%;   position: relative;   transition: all 5s ease-in-out; }  .popup h2 {   margin-top: 0;   color: #333; }  .popup .close {   position: absolute;   top: 20px;   right: 30px;   transition: all 200ms;   font-size: 30px;   font-weight: bold;   text-decoration: none;   color: #333; }  .popup .content {   height:95%;   overflow: scroll;   overflow-x: hidden; }  @media screen and (max-width: 700px){   .box{     width: 70%;   }   .popup{     width: 70%;   } } </code></pre>  <p>In the fiddle my problem is not reconstructed.  Even with all the other stuff the fiddle works correct but the problem still appears at my page though the code is the same in the fiddle and on my page.</p>  <p>I am using a <a href="https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/" rel="nofollow">fullPageSlider</a> of Alvarotrigo. Perhaps the issue has something to deal with it?</p>
