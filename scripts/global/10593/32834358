<p>I have a C# project (Win Forms), where a form reads an external text file, and then puts the text in a textbox on the form. What I would like to do is create a hyperlink from the text that the program reads in.</p>  <p>For example, if the text file reads "To go to Google, click HERE [www.google.com]", then I want the program to make "HERE" clickable, and go to www.google.com if HERE is clicked on.</p>  <p>Right now the program can read in the text file and recognize the web address just fine. I just don't know how to make "HERE" clickable.</p>  <p>Note: Due to external factors, I cannot make a button, or LinkLabel, or other object for the user to click on. The word itself has to be the hyperlink (if that is at all possible). Also, I have to read the string from an external file. I can't simply put textBox1.Text = "To go to Google, click HERE [www.google.com]";</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
