<p>This may be heresy in IOS world but is there any shorthand way to achieve equivalent of a hyperlink from one detail screen to another?</p>  <p>I have a detail view controller reached via a segue from a tableview controller.  However, I would like to have a button on the detail view controller that links to another detail view controller.  I know it's easy enough to wire the button to another view controller in storyboard and trigger an action method on touch in the other storyboard that does something.  The question is how to pass parameters to the other view controller so it shows what I want?</p>  <p>For example, original screen has Product detail.  I would like a button that goes to another screen that shows shipping options based on weight.</p>  <p>In web world, you could have a link that says <code>&lt;a href="shipping.aspx?weight=10"&gt;</code>.  </p>  <p>Is there an equivalent way to pass the weight=10 in IOS?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions on how to tackle this.</p>
