<p>I am trying to tag an item in IOS. On the item page, I'd like to have a link to the tag.  However, the screen for the tag varies based on the tag.</p>  <p>Example, for an item of clothing, if it is tagged, shirt, I'd like the shirt tag to point to the shirt page, if the tag is jacket, I'd like to point to the jacket tag etc.</p>  <p>For this reason, I cannot hardwire a segue in Storyboard to a given view controller.  Can anyone suggest a way to point to different view controllers based on the tag.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions. </p>
