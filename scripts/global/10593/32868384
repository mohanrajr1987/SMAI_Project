<p>I am trying to have a <code>div</code> element on every page of my site that will contain the product number and then have a link that will put that number at the end. For example,</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="productnumber"&gt;01101&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="purchaseurl"&gt;https://example.com/#&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Then put the contents of the element with id <em>"productnumber"</em> after the # of the link.</p>  <p>Any idea if this is possible? Since this would make life easier than editing all existing pages and their respective <code>php</code> files.</p>
