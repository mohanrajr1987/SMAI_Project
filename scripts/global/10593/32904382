<p>I have a field to my db which is external link and one that is a file. I need to display these fields to my view. I have this code where I call my data.</p>  <pre><code>@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.announcement_Link) </code></pre>  <p>and for the file</p>  <pre><code>@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.announcement_Uploaded_File) </code></pre>  <p>It brings the data. How can I make them to be a link and the file to be downloaded? thank you</p>
