<p>I have a content script loaded by an extension in Safari to control HTML5 video on YouTube. I'm having problem with playing the video in Javascript with either</p>  <pre><code>$('.video-stream').get(0).play() </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream")[0].play() </code></pre>  <p>The weird thing is that before that line is executed, I checked that the status of the video is paused and it is executed, the status of the video is not paused. I verified by outputting to console with:</p>  <pre><code>console.log("before playing " + $('.video-stream').get(0).paused); // true $('.video-stream').get(0).play() console.log("after playing " + $video.get(0).paused); // false </code></pre>  <p>But the video is not playing. If I execute the command on the console with</p>  <pre><code>$('.video-stream').play() </code></pre>  <p>It continues to play.</p>  <p>I've checked the readyState of the video element and it's 4 which means it's ready to play.</p>  <p>Has someone faced the same issue before?</p>
