<p>I want to integrate video from thecube website ( <a href="http://thecube.com/cube/hubcityradio" rel="nofollow">http://thecube.com/cube/hubcityradio</a> ) for video and channel with share url.</p>  <p>I have solution for the video integration I am using the share link ( e.g. <a href="https://thecube.com/c/314198" rel="nofollow">https://thecube.com/c/314198</a>  ) for the video and refere the video id to build the embed tag as below.  “”.</p>  <p>For channel share link I am not able to use share link for channel (e.g.  <a href="http://thecube.com/r/urkw6a46" rel="nofollow">http://thecube.com/r/urkw6a46</a> ), as share link for channel uses referral_token not Channel_id in the Share link and  TheCube API does not have an option to get Channel details based on  referral_token (<a href="https://thecube.com/api/v1/docs" rel="nofollow">https://thecube.com/api/v1/docs</a>). I can get channel details only by Channel_id. Can anyone please guide me on this.</p>  <p>I am getting following JSON response with Channel_id API.  <a href="https://thecube.com/api/v1/channels/503516" rel="nofollow">https://thecube.com/api/v1/channels/503516</a> </p>  <p>API Response:</p>  <p><code>{   "id": 503516,   "name": "Instant Cubetastic",   "real_name": "Home",   "desc": "Check out the latest live streaming broadcasts and prior event videos for Instant Cubetastic.",   "url": "//thecube.com/cube/instant-cubetastic",   "cube": "Instant Cubetastic",   "cube_id": 101088,   "cube_type": "features",   "cube_url": "instant-cubetastic",   "owner_id": null,   "showing_url": "http://thecube.com/clip/316555",   "follower_count": 77968,   "event_count": 1,   "highlight_count": 1652,   "roster_count": 0,   "poll_count": 0,   "views": 0,   "referral_token": "urkw6a46" }</code></p>  <p>Thanks</p>
