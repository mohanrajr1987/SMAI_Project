<p>When I use the API it returns the <strong><em>LEAST</em></strong> rated videos first even though the API documentation says it return Highest first. It even works that way in the API explorer see: <a href="https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.search.list?part=snippet&amp;maxResults=5&amp;order=rating&amp;q=prattsville&amp;type=video&amp;_h=1&amp;" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.search.list?part=snippet&amp;maxResults=5&amp;order=rating&amp;q=prattsville&amp;type=video&amp;_h=1&amp;</a></p>  <p>I would like to do this without querying for the total of the results for every query term.(It costs an extra query for every term if not). Vimeo has a "direction" field in their API I was wondering if there is something similar that's not documented or something (since the API documentation is wrong).</p>
