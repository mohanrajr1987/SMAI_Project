<p>There is a section of external links at the 'About' tab of YouTube user. How to get the links through YouTube API?</p>  <p>For example, there are twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc. links at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/google/about" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/user/google/about</a></p>  <p>I couldn't find anywhere in the documentation. Because the documentation and structure is kinda difficult to follow, I might miss the relevant parts of it.</p>
