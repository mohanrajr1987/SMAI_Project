<p>I'm trying to login to Youtube with C#. My code:</p>  <pre><code>       HttpWebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLoginAuth") as HttpWebRequest;         request.Referer = "https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?passive=true&amp;continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fsignin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26feature%3Dsign_in_button%26nomobiletemp%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26next%3D%252F&amp;uilel=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;service=youtube";         request.Host = "accounts.google.com";         Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; parameters = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;{         {"continue","https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fsignin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26feature%3Dsign_in_button%26nomobiletemp%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26next%3D%252F"},         {"service","youtube"},{"uilel","3"},{"dsh","157212168103955870"},{"hl","en_US"},         {"GALX","PTqcwpZb2aE"},{"pstMsg","1"},{"dnConn",""}, {"checkConnection","youtube%3A248%3A1"},          {"checkedDomains","youtube"}, {"timeStmp",""}, {"secTok",""}, {"Email","myEmail"}, {"Passwd","myPassword"},          {"signIn","Sign+in"}, {"PersistentCookie","yes"}, {"rmShown","1"}};          HttpWebResponse r = request.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse; </code></pre>  <p>But when I run the code, it only gets me to the login page, but I do not actually get logged in. Could you help me so I actually get logged on? I do not understand what I am doing wrong. My form parameters match the ones on the login page, so it should work.</p>
