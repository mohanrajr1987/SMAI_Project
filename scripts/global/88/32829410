<p>How do I start playing a video on a mobile device when I press on an element outside of the container of the video. For example , start a video when I press a button ?</p>  <p>I know in some mobile autoplay is blocked(?), that's why I want add button for users so they can start video.</p>  <p>Using Play control from video provider isn't an option for me.</p>  <p>I'm using video from Youtube and videojs library.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
