<p>I have an application to create and manage YouTube live events. It all works good. I've one last requirement in my app to detect whether the user has really enabled livestreaming for his account. Based on the result, my app will either proceed with event creation/management or simply exit.</p>  <p><strong>Note: Currently this is detected as Google API exception</strong> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[The user is not enabled for live streaming. [403]].</p> </blockquote>  <p>But this exception not hit till we actually start preparing the broadcast. I need some way to detect it somewhat early in my logic.</p>
