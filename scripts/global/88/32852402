<p>I'm following a tutorial and it's using Youtube gdata services as an example. This is the code example but I checked gdata.youtube.com and it's no longer available.</p>  <p>Here is the code: <a href="https://github.com/realpython/book2-exercises/blob/master/client-side/clientl.py" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/realpython/book2-exercises/blob/master/client-side/clientl.py</a></p>  <p>So I want to get a good understanding of this part of my book since it seems like a big thing to learn and I realized this gdata stuff was closed in April and not sure what to do to help me learn about working with web services</p>
