<p>So YouTube just added popout chat for their live streams...</p>  <p>Ex:</p>  <pre><code>https://www.youtube.com/live_chat?v=Pf5ydcNT53w&amp;is_popout=1&amp;from_gaming=1&amp;dark_theme=1 </code></pre>  <p>I thought, "finally, I can embed the chatroom on my own website!". Unfortunately, no. When putting the URL into an iframe, you get cross domain errors:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Refused to display '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live_chat?v=Pf5ydcNT53w&amp;is_popout=1&amp;from_gaming=1&amp;dark_theme=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/live_chat?v=Pf5ydcNT53w&amp;is_popout=1&amp;from_gaming=1&amp;dark_theme=1</a>   ' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Well this is Google, and I thought they would have a workaround built in, such as adding <code>&amp;output=embed</code> to the end of the URL... but nope.</p>  <p>Has anyone figured out a solution to this yet?</p>
