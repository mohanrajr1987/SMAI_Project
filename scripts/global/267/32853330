<p>I have UITextVIew in tableViewCell and I am trying save the text. What I did is textViewDidEndEditing to save data. Also I added gesture to detect tap and hidekeyboard for each tap. when User tap from one textview to other, keyboard gets closed and open again. which I don't like. So what I was thinking is to hidekeyboard if current tap is not on the textview.  Please help me doing this using swift.</p>
