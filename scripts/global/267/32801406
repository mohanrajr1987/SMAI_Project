<p>I have some UITextFields which bring the keyboard open.</p>  <p>My question is, how can I detect a touch on the screen that is NOT in ANY UITextField</p>  <p>Pseudocode of what I need:</p>  <pre><code>if(screen is touched)    if(touched view is NOT a UITextField)       [self.view endEditing:YES]; </code></pre>  <p>Is there an easy way to accomplish this? Or another easier way to hide the keyboard when a UITextField is not touched?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
