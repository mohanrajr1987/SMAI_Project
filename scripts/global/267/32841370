<p>I have an assignment in school which i can't get around and i'm stuck with.</p>  <p>the assignment is to build a program that infinitly spews out random numbers in a EasyGUI messagebox ( Yeah i know EasyGUI is old xD )</p>  <p>this is my source code:</p>  <p>import easygui</p>  <pre><code>while True:     easygui.msgbox(random.randint(-100, 100)) </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that when i run this i can't get out of it. I should be allowed to use ctrl+C but that doesn't work. Am i missing something?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
