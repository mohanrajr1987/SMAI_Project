<p>My question is that how can i use Urdu keyboard in my android app? basically i am a beginner and using eclipse. i am making a book app in Urdu language. in which i'd like to add a search view through which user can search the contents in list view easily. but the problem is that i have made the app in Urdu language so i have to use Urdu keyboard for searching. so is there any easy way through which whenever user clicks on the search-bar Urdu keyboard appears to search ?  i have tried to make custom keyboard but it is very difficult to make. and as per my research changing input language by force using java code is not recommended.</p>
