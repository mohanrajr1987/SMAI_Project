<p>I'm wanting to create a <code>TextArea</code> in which, whenever <code>ENTER</code> is pressed after a full stop, It skips 4 spaces at the start of a new line.</p>  <p>I have the <code>TextArea</code> ready. But have no idea how to make an <code>ActionListener</code> with a key.</p>  <p>I'm using <code>JavaFX</code> by the way.</p>  <p>I was thinking something like this:</p>  <pre><code>TextArea theText = new TextArea();  if(theText.getText().endsWith("."){     while(true){         //Code about if "ENTER" is pressed         break;     } } </code></pre>  <p>But I just can't figure out what to put inside the <code>while loop</code>.</p>  <p>I've only used actions on buttons (<code>button.setOnAction(e -&gt; ....)</code>). But never on keys.</p>  <p>Am I going about it all wrong?</p>
