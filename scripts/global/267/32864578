<p>I have implemented one custom keyboard. In which there are few buttons and one text field. On tapping one of the button, I need to paste some text "Ok I got it" in the application's focused text field from where the keyboard was initiated. Meaning, lets say I opened Messages application and I changed the keyboard to my custom keyboard. In that keyboard, I am tapping the button and calling the following line.</p>  <pre><code>[self.textDocumentProxy insertText:@"Ok I got it"]; </code></pre>  <p>But instead of messenger's textview, it is pasted in the custom keyboard's text field.</p>  <p>I am making custom keyboard's textfield as the first responder. Is that the issue? I resigned first responder but it did not work.</p>
