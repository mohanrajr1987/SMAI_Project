<p>We would like to do as below link-shot, please let us know how to do. On the android device (or smart phone), when virtual keyboard would be launched as above and these device get to be connected with USB keyboard, when we are trying to text, cursor would be moved by direction key with using cursor (ex. ‘red box’ mark as above), putting ‘enter’ key would be taken as selection.   </p>  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/caoggbsi1usxj7v/Screenshot.png?dl=0&amp;s=sl" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/caoggbsi1usxj7v/Screenshot.png?dl=0&amp;s=sl</a></p>
