<p>Since iOS 9, I'm having strange keyboard issues. My code remains the same but sometimes my keyboard isn't responding to touch for the MFMessageComposeViewController or for in-App purchases (when you're entering your AppleID and password). The keyboard is being presented and doesn't respond to touch but everything else on the screen does. This is on my device, not on the simulator, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8070666/storekit-support-in-ios5-simulator-keyboard-doesnt-work">this</a> question addresses. </p>  <p>Does anyone know how to fix this or has experienced this? </p>  <p>I change the date on my phone a lot for testing, which I know messes up my ability to have iMessages, and I notice that the keyboard issues often happen then so I think there might be some connection.</p>
