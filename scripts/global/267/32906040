<p>I've created custom keyboard in currently developed app. I was wondering if it's possible to make this keyboard available for "premium" users only? That means that the keyboard wouldn't be accessible for free/non-registered users.</p>  <p>Second thing - keyboard consists of images, and to use specific image user has to tap desired image, then image is copied to clipboard, but user has to paste it by him/herself into text field. Is it possible to somehow write a method that will allow to enter image directly into text field?</p>
