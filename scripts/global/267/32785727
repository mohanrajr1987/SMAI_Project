<p>Right now I have a PySide application that reads input from devices that act like keyboards. My problem is that when the input is too fast PySide skips repetitive characters. For example if I send the text "12223" in keystrokes the application receives only "123". This behavior is limited to repetitive characters as far as I can see. My application currently is running on Linux and to simulate the fast input I used the command:  xte "str 12223"  What could I do to avoid this behavior, is there some parameter that could stop this filtration of events that PySide is doing?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
