<p>I'm developping an Android application thanks to Cordova and Ionic frameworks.</p>  <p>I encounter the following issue:</p>  <ul> <li>I'm on a first screen containing a form, </li> <li>I go to a second screen via ui-router, </li> <li>I come back to the first screen, </li> <li>I touch inside a text input, </li> <li>The keyboard shows up and immediatly closes.</li> </ul>  <p>I noted that when I wait before touching inside the input, I don't encounter this issue (the keyboard stays opened).</p>  <p>A lead I tried to explore is: maybe the Digest Loop is not finished when I touch inside the input, so when it finishes, it restores the screen in its initial state (and so it closes the keyboard).</p>  <p>Any suggestion will be welcome ;-)</p>
