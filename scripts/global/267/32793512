<p>I am working on idea of developing a keyboard app in Android.  My objective is that keyboard keys have key labels in local language characters.But going through tutorials and code, it seems it is not possible. What tutorials suggest is to make user type using English key labels and then translate typed English character into local language alphabets.</p>  <p>But recently I saw Google Hindi Input for Hindi users. This app has Hindi alphabets as key labels. I am not able to understand how it can be achieved.</p>  <p>Any input would be of great help.</p>
