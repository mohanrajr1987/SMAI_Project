<p>I've got a player class, having <code>MoveUp</code>, <code>MoveLeft</code> and <code>MoveRight</code> functions.<br> At <code>MainScene.cpp</code> (my only scene so far), I've got a listener</p>  <pre><code>auto keyboardListener = EventListenerKeyboard::create(); keyboardListener-&gt;onKeyPressed = CC_CALLBACK_2(MainScene::keyPressed, this); keyboardListener-&gt;onKeyReleased = CC_CALLBACK_2(MainScene::keyReleased, this);  Director::getInstance()-&gt;getEventDispatcher()-&gt;addEventListenerWithSceneGraphPriority(keyboardListener, this); </code></pre>  <p>Also, I've got a pointer <code>player</code>, defined by</p>  <pre><code>this-&gt;player = rootNode-&gt;getChildByName&lt;Player*&gt;("Player1"); </code></pre>  <p>Also, I've got a function <code>keyPressed</code> and <code>keyReleased</code> in <code>MainScene</code>.<br> In <code>keyPressed</code> function, I was scheduling functions with if's:</p>  <pre><code>if (keyCode == cocos2d::EventKeyboard::KeyCode::KEY_D) { schedule(schedule_selector(MainScene::MoveRight)); } </code></pre>  <p>But there was a problem, when I tried to do the same thing with objects instead of sprites and with functions located in separated class, not within the same file.<br> If I try to run code like this in <code>MainScene::keyPressed</code>:</p>  <pre><code>if (keyCode == cocos2d::EventKeyboard::KeyCode::KEY_W) { this-&gt;player-&gt;MoveLeft(5); } </code></pre>  <p>, <code>player</code> moves only once per key press (I want it to move till I release that key), and if I try to schedule it or do something like this, it doesn't work or there are errors.   </p>  <p>I tried to make something with <code>CallFunc</code> and <code>CCCallFunc</code>, but nothing seems to work.<br> Could you please help me? :)</p>
