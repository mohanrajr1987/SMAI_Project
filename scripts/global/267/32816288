<p>I recently bought a new Asus Zenbook UX303L with Win 8.1 Pro.</p>  <p>From time to time the keyboard stops working but only parts of it. All "Controll Keys" (ESC, F-Buttons, Return, Shift, STRG, Space, ALT, Win-Key) are working just fine. The letters aren't. The problem continues to exist, even if I plug in an extern keyboard.</p>  <p>After a while the keyboard starts working again, but only in a few applications. I can for example enter a URL in Chrome, but I cant't type in the Windows search bar etc.</p>  <p>The Win device manager can't detect any problems with missing drivers or anything. </p>  <p>Has anyone an idea what could cause this behavior and how to stop it? And can somebody explain why the problems continous to exist on an extern keyboard too?</p>
