<p>I checked many answers but i didn't found any helpful because mostly answers are to share data between keyboard and containing app. But when i am seeing many apps on Appstore they detect access without opening their keyboard. I want to know what is direct way to check keyboard Full access given or keyboard added to keyboard list.</p>
