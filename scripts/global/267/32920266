<p>Below is what my app looks like. Its a messaging app.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UG8d5.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UG8d5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>There are two fragments in one screen Fragment1 (Beige color) and Fragment2 (Dark grey color). The EditText and "+" button are inside Fragment2. Initially Fragment1, EditText and + button are visible. </p>  <ol> <li><p>When I click on EditText, keyboard comes up, obviously and the EditText and + button comes above keyboard.</p></li> <li><p>when I click on + button then Layout2 of Fragment2 is visible and the keyboard hides if visible.</p></li> <li><p>If I click on EditText and Layout2 is visible then Layout2 hides and keyboard comes up.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Now my problem is that the switching from Keyboard to Layout2 and vice versa is not smooth. The screen kinda flickers. What I want is:</p>  <ol> <li><p>If keyboard is visible and I click + button, then the EditText and + button should stay there, keyboard should go down and Layout2 should come up.</p></li> <li><p>If layout2 is visible and I click on EditText, then there are two possibilities.</p>  <p>A. Either EditText and + button should stay there, Layout2 should go down and keyboard should come up smoothly.</p>  <p>B. Or EditText, + button should stay there, keyboard should come up and Layout should go down after.</p></li> </ol>  <p>My user experience is kinda bad with all these jerks and flickers. Please help me out in implementing this smooth transition.</p>
