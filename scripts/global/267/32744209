<p>I have a strange visual bug that only affects iOS 9 devices:</p>  <p>My app’s login <code>UIViewController</code> runs off and gets an OAuth token when you hit the button, much like you’d expect. If the response from my API returns a specific status code, I pop up a <code>UIAlertView</code> saying they need to reset their password (this is if they’ve been flagged as such on the server end). The email and password fields for login <code>resignFirstResponder</code> once you hit the button, standard stuff.</p>  <p>On iOS 9 only, if you hit the reset path, the second you tap OK on that alert view, the keyboard pops back up, for maybe 800ms, then dismisses again. It’s almost as if something was queued to present it, but the presence of the alert blocked it until you hit OK – it’s absolutely instantaneous after hitting okay on the alert.</p>  <p>It seems a really tricky one to debug. I’ve added symbolic breakpoints to <code>becomeFirstResponder</code> and it isn’t called anywhere near this process occurring.</p>  <p>Any other ideas for how I can look at debugging / fixing this? It doesn’t affect iOS 7 and iOS 8, only iOS 9.</p>
