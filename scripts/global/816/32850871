<p>Suppose there's a table with columns (<code>UserID</code>, <code>FieldID</code>, <code>Value</code>), with half a million records. I want to see if some search term T(N) occurs anywhere in each <code>Value</code> (i.e. <code>Value.Contains( T(N) )</code> ).</p>  <p>I think I'm just hitting a wall volume wise, just too many values to sift through. I don't think a Full Text index will help, because it's only useful for <code>StartsWith</code> queries that look at individual words, not occurrences anywhere within the string at all.</p>  <p>Is there a good approach to indexing this kind of data for such a search in SQL Server?</p>
