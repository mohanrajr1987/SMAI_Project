<p>I would like to allow customers of the mobile shopping app that I am developing to be able to search items using an image. The idea is to allow them to take photos, crop and upload them to the server and see items that are similar to the ones they have uploaded. I have looked at LTU for this purpose. I would like to know if there are other technologies available which can offer the functionality that I am talking about.</p>
