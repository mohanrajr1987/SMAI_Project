<p>Lets suppose, I have two indices, created from respective MySQL table.</p>  <pre><code>folder: folder_id, resume_id, status  resume: resume_id, title, skills, experience etc... </code></pre>  <p>I want few data that needs JOIN on the basis of <code>resume_id</code>. We can have auto increment field in Indices, if required.<br><br>  According to me, Options available with me are:<br> 1. <strong>Index merging</strong>: I don't want to merge index, because it will take much space. I have data in billions. 2. <strong>Creation of one Index after joining tables</strong>. Problem with this solution is that, a folder have many resumes, and one resume can be in many other folders (Many to many). So, same resume's data will be indexed many times, thereby provoking data redundancy.</p>  <p>Please suggest a way, if possible in sphinx, to achieve this, maintaining the performance, and reducing data redundancy as well. I have to use this in production environment with billions of data. Thanks in advance :)</p>
