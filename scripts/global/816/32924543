<p>Let's say I have this <a href="https://hackintoshrao.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dfs_order.jpg" rel="nofollow">graph</a> and I want to use DFS from A to G, if I convert it into a tree search, will that make any change ? I tried and that is what I found, and please correct to me if I am wrong</p>  <p>Graph search : Frontier (LIFO): </p>  <pre><code>A  B C E  D F C E *  C E  G E  E </code></pre>  <p>G is the goal state</p>  <p>and for the Tree search things will be the same but only the graph could me more simple</p>  <ul> <li>I ignored A because it is already visited, we can find that in Explored list  ** I expanded nodes in alphabetical order when there are more than one candidate for expansion.</li> </ul>  <p>so what is the difference between graph and tree in this case ? please help </p>
