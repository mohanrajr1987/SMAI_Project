<p>I need to find a pattern ATG[any number of any characters triplets][TGA or TAG or TGA], where I need only the first ATG, further up to [TGA or TAG or TAA] do not matter.</p>  <p>And this should be interrupted at [TGA or TAG or TAA].  In string there could be several such, they do not need to overlap. </p>  <p>For example search on 'ATGcccATGgggTAGgATGtttTAA' should give 'ATGcccATGgggTAG' and 'ATGtttTAA' as a result. </p>  <p>Is there any way to do this in Python? </p>
