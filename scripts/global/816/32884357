<p>I have table with millions of rows. Now when User make any spelling mistake while searching string or word from table, I want to recommend user correct word or string from table. I am using jaro-winkler algorithm to compare distance of string, but as my database is huge my query is taking so much time in execution. Some how I will have to minimize data before applying jaro-winkler algorithm.</p>  <p>Is there any other better way through which I can get quick search recommendation from large table.</p>  <p>I want to build similar search like google search without auto suggestion. I am using my sql database.</p>  <p>Please suggest. </p>
