<p>I am trying to use Boost C++ library to implement Boyer Moore algorithm to search a large text for a specific pattern. However, the pattern doesn't include whitespaces. How can i use the boost library function:</p>  <p>corpusIter boyer_moore_search (         corpusIter corpus_first, corpusIter corpus_last,         patIter pat_first, patIter pat_last );</p>  <p>I need to output the line number the specific pattern occurs and also the number of occurences. Any pointers on how the library search function does the comparison would be helpful. Also is the Boyer Moore search function thread-safe?</p>
