<p>The link is <a href="http://www.startsailing.org/test-map/" rel="nofollow">http://www.startsailing.org/test-map/</a>. I'm looking to have a search box also within the search box so that anyone can search a zip code or an address without having to click to open the map on it's own browser.  Also if we can have the map load to the location of the user that would be ideal.</p>
