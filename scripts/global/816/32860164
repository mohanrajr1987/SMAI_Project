<p>I am working on a Magento theme. I am new to Magento. On my website the search bar is working fine but we have removed some product categories from the website. So I want to make these categories un-searchable. I don't know how to do this? They are are still searchable. I am working with the Magento admin panel. Please help me solve this problem. What steps should I take next?</p>  <p>Some categories give me this error</p>  <pre><code>Fatal error: Call to a member function getId() on a non-object in /home/...../template/catalog/layer/view.phtml on line 122 </code></pre>
