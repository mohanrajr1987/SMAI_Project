<p>I’m in the preliminary stages of creating a website that includes a search function that allows the user to search public filesharing and storage websites.  Subsequently the user’s results will be displayed in a variety of formats on our website based on the file extension.  In order to display the results first and foremost I need to generate a list of the files from the third party URLs.  The second stage is relatively straight forward and will be accomplished with some basic HTML code.  </p>  <p>How would I go about searching these third-party filesharing websites?  Is using a search engine API a viable option or is there other solution?   </p>
