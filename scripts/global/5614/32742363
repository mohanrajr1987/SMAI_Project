<p>Trying to set up a (I think) relatively simple modal to show the sites cookie policy. </p>  <p>The policy is on <code>/cookiepolicy</code>. Checked and that link works nicely. </p>  <p>I then created a button (that does call the code)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href ng-click="showCookie()"&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>As I just want to call the modal for the url, nothing more is added to the html.</p>  <p>The function that calls the modal (which also is called and reports success as per the last line.)</p>  <pre><code>app.controller('IndexController', function($scope, ModalService) {     $scope.showCookie = function (data) {         ModalService.showModal({             templateUrl: "/cookie-policy",             controller: "ModalController"         }).then(function (modal) {              //it's a bootstrap element, use 'modal' to show it             modal.element.modal;             modal.close.then(function (result) {                 console.log(result);             });         });     } }); </code></pre>  <p>The modal also have its own controller</p>  <pre><code>betchaHttp.controller('ModalController', function($scope, close) {      // when you need to close the modal, call close     close("Success!"); }); </code></pre>  <p>The thing is that when I press it, nothing comes up on the page, neither is there a error message. Am I missing something rather obvious (or not so obvious)</p>
