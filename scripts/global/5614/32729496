<p>Hi Im trying to trying to track down a good modern Vanilla Javascript modal/lytebox with iFrame support, essentially I have I number of links like below:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a class="edit-html" href="/iframe.html?para=123"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>That I want to trigger the modal with iframe content, without having to embed anything other than JS/CSS in the page (i.e. no modal markup)</p>  <p>HighslideJS (<a href="http://highslide.com/examples/iframe.html" rel="nofollow">http://highslide.com/examples/iframe.html</a>) meets the main requirements(although it doesn't have a modern look and isn't open source) does anyone know of any alternatives?</p>  <p>I've had a look at this link <a href="http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/" rel="nofollow">http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/</a> although the list looks quite old and only HighSlideJS meets my requirements on that list</p>  <p>So my main requirements are:</p>  <ol> <li>Vanilla JS (No dependencies) </li> <li>Iframe Content determined by href tag</li> <li>Actively Maintained, ideally on Github</li> <li>Modal markup does not need to be manually embedded on page</li> </ol>
