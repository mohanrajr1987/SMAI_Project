<p>I am using Bootstrap 3 in my application and it has a couple of modals. I want the modals to have different widths, but the only way I have found to change the width is to change the value of <code>modal-dialog</code> or <code>modal-content</code> in CSS. If I do this, it changes the width of the other modals as well. The examples I have found are usually for one modal which haven't helped much.</p>  <p>The modal is opened using: </p>  <pre><code>this.$modal.open({                 templateUrl: 'Modal.tpl.html',                 controller: 'ModalCtrl'}             ); </code></pre>  <p>The modal is defined in an html file and I use CSS to style it.       </p>  <p>Is there a way that I can have different modal widths without changing the value of <code>modal-dialog</code> or <code>modal-content</code>? </p>
