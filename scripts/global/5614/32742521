<p>I'm trying to use promises in my app , however I'm not sure if i do it right. The reason I use promise is because ,my app gets input of username and it needs to find it in the local storage, if it doesn't exist it makes a consloe.log(err).</p>  <p>the code:</p>  <pre><code>modalInstance.result.then(function(conUser) {             var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {                 // do a thing, possibly async, thenâ€¦                 resolve("Stuff worked!",                 conUser.countConnect++,                 $localstorage.setObject('a',$scope.Users),                 $scope.User = $filter('filter')($scope.Users, { userName: conUser.u})[0],                 console.log($scope.User.userName),                 $scope.User.connected = 'true',                 $scope.User.countConnect ++,                 $localstorage.setObject('a',$scope.Users)                 //// $scope.Users.push(conUser);                 );                  reject(Error("It broke"));             });             promise.then(function(result) {                 console.log(result); // "Stuff worked!"             }, function(err) {                 console.log(err); // Error: "It broke"             });          });  </code></pre>  <p>It works but, is there a better way to do it ? I'm not sure that it should look like this.</p>
