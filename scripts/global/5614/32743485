<p>I'm building a site where I use many modals, I have pages that is remotely injected through modals. This is working fine however I noticed a slight delay sometimes when calling a modal.</p>  <p>I read an article on css-tricks about prerendering and prefetching assets. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/" rel="nofollow">https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/</a></p>  <p>Should this work? by prerendering all URLS in the head, I tried but it does not make any difference. Or does anyone have any better suggestion?</p>
