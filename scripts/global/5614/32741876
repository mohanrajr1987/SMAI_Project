<p>I'm trying to add a modal popup that allows a user to save a "featured image" with their article. I'm getting tripped up combining the two models in the form, and getting it to save the relationship properly. I have my controllers, models, and blade files here:</p>  <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/bootlear/57582d7c49be2b247900" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/bootlear/57582d7c49be2b247900</a></p>  <p>Any pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>
