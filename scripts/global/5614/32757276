<p>I am working on updating an old website (written in JSP, javascript, Tomcat) from IE8 to IE11.</p>  <p>In this project, when user press a button, it's open a modal dialog using showModalDialog method of javascript. This modal dialog will then create another modal dialog. (I know this is a very bad way to do stuff, but I did not wrote those code and I can not change it too).</p>  <p>The problem is, the second dialog was block by the first dialog. I have tried to use window.body.focus() on the child dialog but the first one still display above it. Are there any way to make the child dialog to go to the front? </p>  <p>I can not hide the first dialog either. Please help me.</p>
