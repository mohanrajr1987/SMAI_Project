<p>I'm trying to properly close a modal when if I press the x button.</p>  <p>At first i tried doing this in the main index.cshtml page</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="modal fade" id="myModal" role="dialog"&gt;      &lt;div class="modal-dialog"&gt;            @Html.Partial("Create")      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and when closing the modal in my create page i had this</p>  <pre><code>&lt;button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And the modal closed properly but this was a popup from the main screen.</p>  <p>Although it technically worked I wanted the screen to be a bit bigger. So I tried doing this in the index.cshtml page.</p>  <pre><code>@Html.ActionLink("Create new link", "Create")  </code></pre>  <p>The create screen still has the same design with the inline class of "modal-content" but the close button doesn't seem to work. I wasn't sure if it was because the ActionLink part is treating it as a brand new page since most links i looked online seem to say include the "data-dismiss="modal"" part and everything is fine. </p>  <p>If I do another actionlink back to the main page that completely refreshes the page and that isn't what I want because it refreshes the data that the user currently has. There's dropdown lists, query results and filtering done.</p>  <p>Is there a way to treat a modal page like a cshtml page properly so that I can close it without completely refreshing the entire page? Or am I going about this problem the wrong way.</p>
