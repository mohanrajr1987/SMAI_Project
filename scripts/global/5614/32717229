<p>I am facing a really silly issue that is annoying me too much.<br> I have a bootstrap modal popup which opens when I click on <strong>Add</strong> button from the page.  </p>  <p>it works perfectly when I open it first time but when I close it and reopen (without refreshing the page) then the buttons on the modal like <strong>Save</strong>, <strong>Reset</strong> doesn't work.  </p>  <p>I tried the below code. This closes the modal popup perfectly but buttons doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>jQuery('[data-dismiss="modal"]').on('click', function(){     jQuery('.modal').hide();     jQuery('.modal-backdrop').hide(); }); </code></pre>  <p>If I refresh the page and open the modal popup then it will work like a charm and if again I close and reopen then doesn't work.</p>  <p>So can somebody help me out from this situation.</p>  <p><strong>Note :-</strong> I am not having any modal inside a modal. It's simply one popup that is causing issue.</p>  <p>I am using below code for <strong>save</strong> button.</p>  <pre><code>$("#btnSave").die("click").bind("click", function() {     //calling ajax to save }); </code></pre>
