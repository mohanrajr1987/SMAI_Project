<p>I'm using the History API's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#The_replaceState()_method" rel="nofollow">replaceState()</a> when a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap modal</a> is displayed, so the user can share, bookmark, etc. the URL when the page is in it's current state. When a user closes the modal, the URL still contains the query string <code>domain.com/page/?modal=url-friendly-name</code>.</p>  <p>I cannot seem to get the URL to return to just <code>domain.com/page/</code>. How can this be accomplished?</p>  <p>I believe whatever code is needed, should be inserted in the following event listener:</p>  <pre><code>$('#modal').on('hidden.bs.modal', function () {  // return URL back to domain.com/page/ }); </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
