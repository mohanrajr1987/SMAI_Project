<p>I have a large jQuery modal dialog which contains a large form which scrolls up and down. From within this a user can click a link on one of the fields which opens a second modal dialog over the top will a much larger editor for that field. When they click the save button in the second dialog, the contents of the field in the first is updated, all working well.</p>  <p>The problem is that when the second dialog is closed, the first one keep scrolling to the top so the user must now scroll back down to find the field they just edited and continue with the form. Is there a way to prevent this?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
