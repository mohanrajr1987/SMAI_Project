<p>Is this possible to validate POJO class in similiar way to that how it is done in MVC controller in non-MVC application?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>public class Form {     @NotNull     @Size(min = 4, max = 25)     private String login;     ... } </code></pre>  <p>And then:</p>  <pre><code>Form f = new Form(); f.setLogin("login"); </code></pre>  <p>And now I would like to pass it to some kind of validator which will test all fields based on their annotations just like @Valid does in MVC.</p>  <p>Note that I want to validate fields by their annotations. I don't want to write all validation conditions such if (login.lenght() &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; ....</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>
