<p>In different projects I see that some use hardcoded strings and others constants.  I cannot find an answer as to which is better for RAM memory, use constants or hardcoded? i.e.</p>  <pre><code>@SerializedName(value = Constants.Annotation.PICTURE_ID) private int pictureID; </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>@SerializedName(value = "picture_url") private String url;  </code></pre>
