<p>I have a problem formatting an annotation type element of an array type. I'd like to instruct the <strong>Eclipse Formatter</strong> to insert a space between the type and the name of the element.</p>  <p>So this would be great:</p>  <pre><code>String[] value(); </code></pre>  <p>But all I get is this (no space between the closing square bracket and the element name):</p>  <pre><code>String[]value(); </code></pre>  <p>Everything works fine if the type is not an array.</p>  <p>Probably I just do not know how to name the "annotation element type space after closing square bracket" correctly. Otherwise I suppose I would find the configuration option or at least a reference to a bug report.</p>
