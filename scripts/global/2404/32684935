<p>I have created a custom annotation as follows:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * @Annotation  * @Target("CLASS")  */ class Serializable {     /**      * Type of serialization to perform      *      * @Enum({"JSON", "ARRAY"})      * @Required      */     public $type;       /**      * @return string      */     public function getType()     {         return $this-&gt;type;     } } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see the type is restricted with Enum which is working as expected in a test - I am getting an exception if I feed the reader with a class annotated with:</p>  <pre><code>@Serializable(type="XML") </code></pre>  <p>However, if I try this annotation:</p>  <pre><code>@Serializable() </code></pre>  <p>I would expect to see  an exception as well, but nothing is thrown.</p>  <p>What could be a reason?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
