<p>I am looking for data in XML format from Dbpedia Spotlight. It worked before with my small test data. </p>  <p>But my real data includes large texts with around 10,000 lines per iteration. <strong>Now I don't get a XML output and get it in HTML format.</strong> </p>  <p>Then I tried it again with my small test data and for those text also now I get the output in HTML format. </p>  <p>Is there any reason for this? How can I get the output in XML format? :)</p>  <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
