<p>I have a method that has code that depends on c# 6.0. (The 6.0 new features are cool BTW!)</p>  <p>My co-workers may open it with an older version and be confused by the compile error or think it's a typo or syntax error. I don't want them wasting time, and I also want to <a href="http://www.internetslang.com/CMA-meaning-definition.asp" rel="nofollow">CMA</a>.</p>  <p>I'd like to mark the method with a marker attribute that indicates that this method uses c# 6.0.</p>  <p>Something like:</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>[LanguageVersion(6.0, "This uses a C# 6.0 (Visual Studio 2015) language feature!")] public string MyCoolMethod() =&gt; "hello world"; </code></pre>  <p>Is there such an attribute in the framework? What would be the closest thing to indicate my intention?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT (POSSIBLE SOLUTION):</strong></p>  <p>Per user2864740's suggestion, I found a project setting under Build, <kbd>Advanced Build</kbd>... <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vULm0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vULm0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>...Unfortunately, Visual Studio 2010 does not recognize the <code>C# 6.0</code> value of the <code>Language Version</code> setting and simply thinks it's a grammar error. The Language Version of the project, as opened in Visual Studio 2010 project settings, is blanked out! <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NxhHD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NxhHD.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>EDIT (Chosen Solution):</strong></p>  <p>This is the experience someone will get if they open this class in an older IDE: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cMfhs.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cMfhs.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
