<p>I'm using an annotation processor to generate a source file.  This works, the class gets added in /target/classes and I can import it and use it as expected.</p>  <p>It's kind of annoying though because everywhere I use that source file intellij highlights it as red because it doesn't know about it.</p>  <p>Is it possible to somehow add that generated file somewhere that intellij knows about it and can use it to autocomplete things?  I realize the file would potentially be slightly dated because it might change the next time the annotation processor is invoked, but I'm okay with that because it is fairly static.  I could also copy the file to my main src directory but that doesn't seem very DRY.</p>
