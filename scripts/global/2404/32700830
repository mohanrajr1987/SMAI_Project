<p>I am using Jersey, Jackson for creating RESTful services. The validation of input messages is done using annotations provided by <code>javax.validation</code>. It is working fine except that now I have to add a member of type <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>I want to add below two validations to it:</p>  <ol> <li>the size of list cannot be more than 3</li> <li>the elements in the list can only have values in this range 1..99</li> </ol>  <p>I know how to add first validation. But I don't know how to add the second one. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>@Size(max = 3, message = "There cannot be more than 3 codes") private List&lt;Integer&gt; codes; </code></pre>
