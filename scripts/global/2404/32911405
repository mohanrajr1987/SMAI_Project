<pre><code>- (void)handleLongPress:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer {     if (gestureRecognizer.state != UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan)     {         return;     }     CGPoint touchPoint = [gestureRecognizer locationInView:self.mapView];     _touchMapCoordinate = [self.mapView convertPoint:touchPoint toCoordinateFromView:self.mapView];     MKPointAnnotation *point = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];     point.coordinate = _touchMapCoordinate;     point.title = @"Test";     point.subtitle = @"Test2";     for (id annotation in self.mapView.annotations) {         [self.mapView removeAnnotation:annotation];     }      [self.mapView addAnnotation:point]; } </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone explain to me what is wrong with the above code? I am trying to add an annotation with a long press. I have verified that it get's the right coordinates, and I have the delegate methods. Any ideas? This worked once upon a time, and now I can't seem to get it working.</p>
