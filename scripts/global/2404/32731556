<p>I need an expert suggestion. What is ideal in terms of performance and standards?</p>  <p>1) Defining all routes in src//Resources/config/routing.yml as suggested by Symfony base tutorial ?</p>  <p>OR </p>  <p>2) Defining routes in controllers as annotations? </p>  <p>Both seems to be right and working fine. My question is to justify as to which one is better for performance and fits into symfony standards more closely. </p>
