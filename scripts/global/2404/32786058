<p>Could you please clarify the actual purpose of this annotation?   - What happens if we don't have corresponding constraint defined using SQL Table definition in DB. Will hibernate check for uniqueness when we try to do inserts? Or Is this the purpose of DB? If hibernate will not check while inserting what is the reason behind specifying this exclusively? If we are not auto-generating the Table definitions from Model classes, then is there any purpose for these annotations?</p>
