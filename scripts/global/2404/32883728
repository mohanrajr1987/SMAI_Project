<p>I have aar lib which provide annotation based on AspectJ. When I using In test app in the same project (libary was as module) everything works good. But when I try use it outside the library they dosen't work. </p>  <p>I saw this solution: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31164904/aspectj-annotated-based-pointcuts-not-being-invoked">AspectJ annotated based pointcuts not being invoked</a> but I want to only include my library as aar file without any plugins. It is possible?  I trying using this: <a href="https://github.com/Archinamon/GradleAspectJ-Android" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Archinamon/GradleAspectJ-Android</a> and this: <a href="https://github.com/uPhyca/gradle-android-aspectj-plugin/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/uPhyca/gradle-android-aspectj-plugin/</a> plugin for aar library. I need some additional lib in app?</p>
