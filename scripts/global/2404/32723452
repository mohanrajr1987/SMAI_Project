<p>When generating a model from a table in Visual Studio, I get these attributes that I don't really feel that I have any use for. Is there a way to remove them?</p>  <pre><code>public partial class TableModel     {         [System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Microsoft.Usage", "CA2214:DoNotCallOverridableMethodsInConstructors")]      ... </code></pre>  <p>Also another thing I wonder, if I've added a couple of custom properties to the model that do not exist as columns in the table, will they be removed next time I update the model? When I've added a column to the table, e.g.?</p>
