<p>I'm having trouble with the fixed positioned slideshow at: <a href="https://artemes-test.myshopify.com" rel="nofollow">https://artemes-test.myshopify.com</a></p>  <p>It's working fine on all browsers except Safari on my mac. You you scroll down, the slideshow appears above the other elements on the page for around 1-5 seconds and then it is rendered below the other elements as it should.</p>  <p>I've removed the javascript and minimised the css to the bare minimal and seems like it's simply the fixed positioning that Safari is not liking.</p>  <p>I've found this previous question which seems similar but I'm not getting very consistent or effective results so far: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22842992/how-to-force-safari-to-repaint-positionfixed-elements-on-scroll">How to force Safari to repaint position:fixed elements on scroll?</a></p>  <p>I've used the following css:</p>  <pre><code>.owl-item.active {   animation: repaint 1ms; }  @keyframes repaint {   from {     width: 99.999%;   }   to {     width: 100%;   } } </code></pre>  <p>And the following css with the 'repaint' class to the 'site-header':</p>  <pre><code>@-webkit-keyframes repaint {      from {         width: 99.9%;     }     to {         width: 100%;     }  }  @-moz-keyframes repaint {      from {         width: 99.9%;     }     to {         width: 100%;     }  }  @keyframes repaint {      from {         width: 99.9%;     }     to {         width: 100%;     }  }  .repaint {     -webkit-animation: repaint 100ms;        -moz-animation: repaint 100ms;         -ms-animation: repaint 100ms;             animation: repaint 100ms; } </code></pre>  <p>Neither code doesn't seem to have much effect, but if I add the 'repaint' class to the 'site-header' it sometimes seems to repaint the image under the header a bit quicker. But it's a bit inconsistent. And when I start adding the 'repaint' class to other elements (footer etc.) it appears to become ineffective again.</p>  <p>Any idea what might be going on here?</p>
