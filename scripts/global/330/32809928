<p>I have a page with a checkbox that is by default <code>checked</code> on page load that indicates whether ALL page links will open in same window or new tab/window (based on user's browser settings). If the box is checked, the links open in a new tab/window, if it is not checked, they will open in same window. Very simple.</p>  <p>HTML</p>  <pre><code>&lt;label&gt;Open links in new page: &lt;input type="checkbox" id="link-pref" checked&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/label&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Using jquery, I have function in <code>$(document).ready()</code> that will perform the work of opening the links appropriately depending on the checkbox state.</p>  <p>Javascript</p>  <pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){     $("a").click(function(){         if ($('#link-pref').is(":checked")){$(this).attr("target","_blank");}         else{$(this).attr("target","_parent");}     }); }); </code></pre>  <p>The problem I am having is that it seems to be working sporadically in desktop browsers, and in Safari (mobile) doesn't really seem to be working at all. The links just open in the same window, regardless of whether the box is checked or not.</p>  <p>According to my research, this SHOULD be working and SHOULD be opening all links on this page in a new tab if the box is checked. But such is not the case, especially in Safari-mobile. Thoughts, ideas?</p>  <p>UPDATE: It seems that the only links that are not opening accordingly in Safari are those which are loaded into a div using an ajax call. The ajax call is being made before the link-opening statement in the <code>$(document).ready()</code> block, so I still see no reason why this would not be working.</p>  <p>Javascript</p>  <pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){     $.ajax({url: "links.cgi",         success: function(result){             $('#linktable').html(result);     }});      $("a").click(function(){         if ($('#link-pref').is(":checked")){$(this).attr("target","_blank");}         else{$(this).attr("target","_parent");}     }); }); </code></pre>
