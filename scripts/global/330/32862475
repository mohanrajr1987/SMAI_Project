<p>I created a new pinned-tab icon for Safari 9 on El Capitan <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/pinnedTabs/pinnedTabs.html" rel="nofollow">as documented by Apple here</a> but I can't seem to get Safari to actually show it when I pin my tab.</p>  <p>Here's the line in my header:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;link rel="mask-icon" href="https://towatchlist.com/img/twl.svg" color="red"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Safari does show the image just fine when I follow <a href="https://towatchlist.com/img/twl.svg" rel="nofollow">the link to the SVG file</a>, but the pinned tab icon still shows the auto-generated letter image even after reloads and pin/unpin etc.</p>  <p>I tried opening up GitHub's SVG (which is working) and copying the general markup there but that didn't fix things either.  I also poked through the Safari console briefly but didn't see it even attempting to land the SVG file.</p>  <p>Any suggestions on how to even debug this or ideas on what is going wrong?</p>
