<p>I have a private website that hosts training videos using the HTML5 video tag and the video.js plugin.  It was working in Chrome/Firefox/Safari up until last Spring, but now the videos no longer work in Safari.  They work fine in Chrome and Firefox.  I upgraded to the latest video.js v4.12 and v5 but that has not helped.  You can view the broken code on this test page.</p>  <p><a href="http://dev.investja.org/videojs_problem2.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.investja.org/videojs_problem2.html</a></p>  <p>When you open the page and click on the video it works fine in Chrome and Firefox but not Safari.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
