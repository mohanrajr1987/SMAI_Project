<p>OK, having a heck of a time here. I can't seem to determine why this bxslider is randomly displaying properly and than randomly not display any images in Safari. I am at my wits end here. </p>  <p>Works fine in all other browsers.</p>  <p>I have checked for errors, checked Network tab, the images indeed load. If I resize the page slightly the images appear, or if I right click to inspect element they appear due to a resize presumably, but until that they wont show up. </p>  <p>You can check out the site here: <a href="http://olmstead.uptowncreativeinc.com" rel="nofollow">http://olmstead.uptowncreativeinc.com</a></p>  <p>Appreciate any help.</p>
