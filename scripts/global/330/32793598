<p>Has anyone encountered this before?</p>  <p>I have local intranet sites, some of which are password-protected (http). </p>  <p>So, for example, we have a link to <a href="http://192.168.0.105/pwd-protected-area" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.0.105/pwd-protected-area</a> . However, in safari on iOS, this link will NOT open in a new tab, ONLY in same window. When I open link in new tab/window, it just goes to a totally blank screen with no url/ip address in the location bar. Does anyone know why this is so, and how to work around? It seems that normal (not protected) links open fine in new tabs, just the password protected ones will not.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
