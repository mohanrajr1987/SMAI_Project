<p>I have an older application that has an iframe.  The iframe shows a document with paging/zooming etc.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;iframe width="780px" height="1025px" scrolling="no" src="pagename.aspx"&gt;If you can see this, your browser doesn't understand IFRAME&lt;/iframe&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However when scrolling up and down on the main page.. the page refreshes. Any ideas on the cause or maybe a fix.  I don't have the option to remove the iframe, and I have seem some CSS tricks to help with scrolling, but nothing so far that mentions the page refreshing.</p>
