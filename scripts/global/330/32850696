<p>I'm having a problem with magento product images that are blurry when viewed in safari, but display fine in firefox.  </p>  <p>Specifically, when you zoom in on the product, the image is very distorted in safari even though I'm using significantly larger product images than what the browser is trying to display.</p>  <p>Here is an example: <a href="http://www.ktmbikeindustries.com/index.php/mountain-bikes/hardtails/carbon-29/myroon-29-prestige-2-f-22-s-xtr-263.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ktmbikeindustries.com/index.php/mountain-bikes/hardtails/carbon-29/myroon-29-prestige-2-f-22-s-xtr-263.html</a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H0HkO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H0HkO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What could be causing the blurry display in safari?  Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>
