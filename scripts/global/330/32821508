<p>I've been searching for a while where does <strong>Safari</strong> stores its homepage, but I couldn't find it anywhere.</p>  <p>I am interested in its path on a Windows machine.</p>  <p>More, I'd like to know if, by any chance, there is some method of doing something like this in cmd (but for safari instead):</p>  <p><code>chrome.exe -homepage "www.mypage.com"</code></p>  <p>If this is not possible, are there any options of programatically changing the homepage on Safari, under a Windows based machine ? </p>
