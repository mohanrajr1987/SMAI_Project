<p>I want to develop a content blocking extension for Safari in iOS and XCode. </p>  <p>I created a single view app with an safari content blocking extension. I added the following JSON into the blockerList.json:</p>  <pre><code>[  {     "trigger": {          "url-filter": ".*"         },     "action": {          "type": "css-display-none",          "selector": ".site-title"         }   }  ] </code></pre>  <p>I am testing in the iOS simulator in XCode, I have activated the Content Blocker in Safari already, but if I go to the website where the "site-title" element is (the filter is used on every website), the div layer is not blocked, it is visible. </p>  <p>The div layer is on the site definitely (I also checked it with Chrome in mobile view):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="site-branding"&gt;   &lt;h1 class="site-title"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.website.com" rel="home"&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div class="site-description"&gt;ContentToBlock&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I am doing wrong?</p>
