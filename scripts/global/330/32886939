<p>I'm trying to create web page, on which you can browse several geometry models, which sizes are large (and also complexity of some of them is very high) and when i'm trying to load them browsers are just stopping the process(it's seems like browsers have some kind of limit on one process), so now i want to create one process for each geometry and then load them on one web page.</p>  <p>Is there any way to create multiple processes in web browser for one page?</p>
