<p>I've been running a WebSocket Service for some months now. It basicly transfers a pile of messages from one end to the other.</p>  <p>The service itself runs great, atleast with Chrome, Firefox and IE10+. The problem begins when I start using Safari.</p>  <p>In the case where my JavaScript Client sends data to the Server, the Client  checks the bufferedAmount value of the WebSocket to see if the buffer has gone  empty. If so, more data is transfered in order to ensure that the connection is always saturated.   </p>  <p>Every browser, except for Safari, gives me a plausible value for the BufferedAmount. Only Safari tells me everytime that the BufferedAmount is zero, no matter how much data I send.  This is leading to the problem that the client is sending more and more data until it freezes.</p>  <p>I could reproduce the problem on a MacBook 2008 running OS X 10.10.3 and Safari 8.0.6.  According to the logs of my service, other Safari setups seem to have problems too. Including IPhones/IPads with Safari 8.x.  A test on the MacBook using Chrome worked like intended.</p>  <p>Anyone an idea about the strange behavior of Safari 8 ?</p>
