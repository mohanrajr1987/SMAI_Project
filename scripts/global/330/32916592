<p>We're writing an app using webpack and babel-core <code>5.8.25</code>.</p>  <p>At one point in time, this happens:</p>  <pre><code>someArray.map(item =&gt; {   const updatedItem = Object.assign({}, item); // silently fails here... doesn't even continue the code    updatedItem.prop = 'something cool'; }); </code></pre>  <p>This is obviously compiled before hitting the browser. It works in the latest version of Chrome and the latest version of iOS Safari, but in Safari <code>8.0.7</code>, it fails silently (no error thrown... just doesn't go past that line).</p>  <p>This, however, works as expected (using lodash):</p>  <pre><code>someArray.map(item =&gt; {   const updatedItem = _.extend({}, item); // the important part    updatedItem.prop = 'something cool'; }); </code></pre>  <p>Any idea? I tried poking around the internet regarding this, but to no avail.</p>
