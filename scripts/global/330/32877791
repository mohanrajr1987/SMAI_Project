<p>I'm looking to work out a few kinks from my answered question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32856108/trouble-vertically-aligning-text-to-middle-of-window-viewport">here</a>. Hopefully I can get some new answers &amp; help others out there.</p>  <p>Here is a snippet of the code I'm working with <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/4vmqwkwv/" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>  <pre><code>#bg_loader:before {     content: "Thank You for Waiting";     display: inline-block;     position: absolute;     bottom: calc(60% - 14em);     width: 100%;     text-align: center;     font-size: 140%;     font-weight: bold;     color: #080; } </code></pre>  <p>Essentially, the text needs to stay be below the image. I believe the issue here is that calc() has some compatibility issues. I know that this is the case for Firefox (<a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=calc()" rel="nofollow">Firefox does not support calc() inside the line-height...</a>).</p>  <p><strong>Update 1</strong>:</p>  <p>I checked <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/4vmqwkwv/" rel="nofollow">this</a> solution in the following:</p>  <p>Chrome: Success</p>  <p>Internet Explorer 11: Success</p>  <p>Opera: Success</p>  <p>Safari 5.1.7: Fail <br/><em>(I only have Safari for Windows, if someone would please test <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/4vmqwkwv/" rel="nofollow">this</a> in Safari Mac &amp; let me know how it works I would appreciate it.)</em></p>  <p>Firefox: Fail</p>  <p>iPad 8.2 (Safari): Fail</p>  <p>The good news is that all the failures appear to have the exact same results. So once a resolution is reached for one it should be resolved for all.</p>
