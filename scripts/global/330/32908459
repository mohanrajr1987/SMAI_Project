<p>I'm trying to use <code>SFSafariViewController</code> to present a form that the user needs to fill out. On the form, there is a "back" button, which fires a url scheme which opens the app. The problem is that the <code>application:openURL:options:</code> method doesn't get called when the url scheme is fired by the web page. When I was using Safari to open the form instead of the <code>SFSafariViewController</code>, the scheme worked, and the <code>application:openURL:options:</code> method was called.</p>  <p>Any ideas why the scheme is not working with <code>SFSafariViewController</code> and how to fix it?</p>
