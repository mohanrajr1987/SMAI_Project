<p>I am using the .net 4.5 framework to decompress some zip files.  I am decompressing zip files that are about 265 Megs, they decompress to about to 400 to 500 Megs but I am getting a .net error - There is not enough space on the disk.</p>  <p>There is plenty of disk space, was curious if anyone else has had this issue or have some advise - Note: I have considered this is a server issue and not the code.</p>  <p>My code is straight forward but I am posting in case someone sees anything.  The following is in VB.Net.</p>  <pre><code>        Using archive As ZipArchive = ZipFile.OpenRead(file)             For Each entry As ZipArchiveEntry In archive.Entries                 entry.ExtractToFile(fullPath &amp; "\" &amp; entry.FullName, True)                 fi = New FileInfo(fullPath &amp; "\" &amp; entry.FullName)                 logEntries.Add(fi.Length &amp; vbTab &amp; fi.LastWriteTime.Date &amp; vbTab &amp; fi.LastWriteTime.Hour.ToString("00") &amp; ":" &amp; fi.LastWriteTime.Minute.ToString("00") &amp; vbTab &amp; fi.Name)                 totalLength = totalLength + fi.Length             Next         End Using </code></pre>  <p>Thanks.</p>
