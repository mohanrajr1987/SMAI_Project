<p>I've got an OS X app that I'm distributing outside the App Store. Currently, users go to my website and download a <code>.zip</code> file which contains the code-signed app within. It's very important to me that users don't have to register or create accounts to use my app.</p>  <p>My problem is I'd like to build out referral codes into my app as a way to encourage sharing. Ideally the flow would be something like:</p>  <ol> <li>User A opens the app and goes to a menu option to get a unique referral link based on a UUID (to avoid collisions).</li> <li>User B goes to the unique referral link and downloads the <code>.zip</code>, which is a specially crafted version of the app that contains the referral code. Magic referral behavior is unlocked for User B.</li> </ol>  <p>I'm not really concerned about users cheating the system since the code is open-source and <a href="http://www.computeforhumanity.org" rel="nofollow">the app</a> is free. But since the app is code-signed I can't change it at all (and I definitely don't want to go down the rabbit hole of trying to get my Heroku server to inject a referral code and then re-sign the app), but I'm not above sneaky things like adding the referral code to the name of the app, re-zipping it on the server, and then having the app inspect its own name to extract the referral code.</p>  <p>That, of course, is ugly.<sup>*</sup> Are there other ways I can cleverly add the referral code to the file metadata? <strong>Or</strong> is there some completely different approach I can take to otherwise achieve my goal? No solution is too hacky!</p>  <hr>  <p><sup>*</sup> Ugly to the user, that is. We're way past the point of worrying about ugly architecture.</p>
