<p>What I have: Xml file created with <code>ChilkatDotNet4</code>'s <code>Xml</code> class, some node in that file with binary content (data in code below is byte array). zipFlag that is passed to <code>SetBinaryContent</code> show that content would be zipped. How file is being created:</p>  <pre><code>var zipFlag = true; var ecryptFlag = false; var password = string.empty;  var xml = new Xml(); var node = xmlFile.FindChild("SomeNode"); node.SetBinaryContent(data, zipFlag, ecryptFlag, password); //in file it is base64 text </code></pre>  <p>What I need: to read this file with <code>System.Xml.XmlDocument</code>, and get the binary content from the "SomeNode" node.</p>  <p>What I've tried: read innerText of "SomeNode", get byte array with <code>FromBase64String</code>, and then unzip with <code>GZipStream</code>, but got <code>InvalidDataException</code> <em>(The magic number in GZip header is not correct. Make sure you are passing in a GZip stream)</em></p>  <p>I strongly believe that someone has already faced the same problem.</p>
