<p>I am creating a zip file with JSZip but I have a very specific requirement that I can't figure out how to do.</p>  <p>When this file is unzipped it needs to create a folder with two files inside it. Let's say foo.zip unzips to create a folder foo with files bar.mp4 and baz.png. </p>  <p>So far that's easy enough I can just go </p>  <pre><code>let zip = new Zip() let folder = zip.folder('foo') folder.file(`bar.mp4`, videoData) folder.file(`baz.png`, imageData) // Save as foo.zip </code></pre>  <p>But what I need to happen is if I rename foo.zip to horse.zip then the folder created should be called horse. If I use the above code then it will always be called foo. I know this is possible because I have several zip files that currently do this.</p>  <p>Edit: I'm not tied to JSZip here either. I'm happy to do this any way that's possible. Code will only be run on the server.</p>
