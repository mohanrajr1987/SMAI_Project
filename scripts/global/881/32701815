<p>Working with Symfony2.3.4, PHP5.6.3 and PHPWord0.12.1.</p>  <p>I am trying to fill a template depending on certain fields fetched from my database. One of the elements I am trying to edit are some checkboxes from this template. </p>  <p>I googled a lot about this but found no solution that could apply to my specific situation.</p>  <p>Basically what I need is to extract the <strong>document.xml</strong> file from the word folder inside the zip file the word.docx really is.</p>  <p>Then edit it by replacing the content of the tag  with the checkbox symbol(checked or not).</p>  <p>I have achieved this so far, the problem is when I try to add this updated <strong>document.xml</strong> back into the .zip, it just doesn't do anything, it does not update the contents of the first <strong>document.xml</strong> or anything at all.</p>  <p>Here it is so far:</p>  <pre><code>$xml = \SimpleXMLElement($this-&gt;zipClass-&gt;getFromName(' word/document.xml')); $checkbox = $xml-&gt;xpath("w:body/w:sdt/w:sdtContent/w:p/w:r");  while(list(, $node) = each($checkbox)){ $node-&gt;t = &lt;symbol-checked&gt;;  //here I add a new tag to the "tree" with the desired symbol as content }  $xml-&gt;saveXML('templates/document.xml'); </code></pre>  <p>note: I put  because I can't find out how to write the checkbox symbol used in word docs.</p>  <p>Well, so far it works, the part I can't get to work is updating the zip file with the new contents of <strong>document.xml</strong></p>  <p>I thought it should be something like:</p>  <pre><code>$this-&gt;zipClass-&gt;addFile('templates/document.xml', 'word/document.xml'); </code></pre>  <p>but it's like i'm doing nothing</p>  <p>help appreciated</p>
