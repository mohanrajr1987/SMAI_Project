<p>I can use the DotNetZip library to unzip a single zip file:</p>  <pre><code>Using Zip As ZipFile = ZipFile.Read(ZipFilePath)     AddMessage("Unzipping " &amp; Zip.Entries.Count &amp; " entries") End Using </code></pre>  <p>However, if I try and pass in the first segment of a split archive produced using 7-Zip (e.g. Pubs.zip.001) then it throws an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not read block - no data!  (position 0x03210FCE)</p> </blockquote>  <p>The documentation seems to infer that you don't have to do anything special to read a split archive:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This property has no effect when reading a split archive. You can read   a split archive in the normal way with DotNetZip.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
