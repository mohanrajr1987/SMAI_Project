<p>I can read file in c++. This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>std::string ReadFile(std::string file) {     char buff[20480];     std::ifstream fread(file, std::ios::binary | std::ios::app);     fread.read(buff,sizeof(buff));     std::string str = buff;     fread.close();     return str; } </code></pre>  <p>The variable "file" is the FilePath. And I get a folder .zip, I want to read the file in folder. What should I do? I try to use libzip, but it can't solve my problem, maybe I didn't use it by wrong way. </p>
