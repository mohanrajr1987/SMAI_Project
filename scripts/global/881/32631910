<p>Can anyone describe exactly how someone can create and execute a python zip package in Maya? A lot of tutorials and questions regarding this jump into the middle and assume certain knowledge. I need a simple example as a starting point.</p>  <pre><code>Folder/     scriptA.py     scriptB.py     scriptC.py  ScriptA:     Import ScriptB     Import ScriptC  Create zip of Folder  In Maya     Code to run Folder as if not zipped     ScriptA.foo() </code></pre>  <p>In folder we have three scripts. ScriptA references the other two. I zip the folder with a program like winrar. In maya, I want to load from this zip as if the files inside were any other module sitting in my script folder (without unzipping preferably). How do I do this? </p>
