<p>Reading from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)#File_headers" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT" rel="nofollow">format specification</a> about the file comment length in zip archives, I see that the maximum comment length is coded using 2 bytes. So would expect room for 65535 bytes of comment for each file.</p>  <p>However, I can read in the specification (but not completely understand):</p>  <pre><code> 4.4.10 file name length: (2 bytes)  4.4.11 extra field length: (2 bytes)  4.4.12 file comment length: (2 bytes)     The length of the file name, extra field, and comment    fields respectively.  The combined length of any    directory record and these three fields should not    generally exceed 65,535 bytes.  If input came from standard    input, the file name length is set to zero. </code></pre>  <p>Does this means that the maximum comment length is <strong>64k - length(filename) - length(extra_fields)</strong> for each file in the archive, or is it for all files together?</p>  <p>Side note: I could generate a zip file with long comments (65535 bytes for each file in the archive) using <em>zipfile</em> from <em>python</em>, and read them using <em>cygwin zip</em>. Some other tools failed to read such zip archives, and <em>miniz.c</em> uses a maximum of 256 bytes for the file comments, so I am wondering what is correct.</p>
