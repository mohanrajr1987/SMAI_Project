<pre><code>&gt; Below is the project folder structure that i am working with: &gt;     [root] &gt;       -build.gradle  &gt;       [project1] &gt;          -build.gradle </code></pre>  <p>Project1 have many main classes. The individual tasks in the build.gradle of Project1 create jar files on task execution with a different jarname using different main-class. </p>  <p>Suppose i need invoke a task within the build.gradle of project1 from build.gradle of root and build a <strong>distZip</strong> from there. How do I do? </p>  <p><strong>Things i Have tried so far:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>I have created a subtask within build.gradle of project1 which does invoke the jar file building task but it does not execute distZip. </li> <li>I have tried invoking distZip, it does build a zip folder but uses the default main class, not the specific one for different tasks.</li> </ol>  <p>Other question is there anyway to build .pkg instead of a zip? </p>
