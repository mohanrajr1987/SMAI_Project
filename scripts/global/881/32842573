<p>Can anyone explain why Photoshop compress .TIF files (with no layers) in ZIP format better than any archiver? Example:</p>  <p>Original .TIF file size: 39.2. Compressed by 7-Zip: 29.5. Compressed by Photoshop: 18.1.</p>  <p>It is known that ZIP compression mode in Photoshop uses Zlib library, wherein a Deflate compression algorithm. The same algorithm was tested with this file in 7-Zip archiver.</p>
