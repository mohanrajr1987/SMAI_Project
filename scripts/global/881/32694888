<p>I'm searching for a possibility to set an archives password to its hashvalue, which I encrypt again - so my program can decrypt the password and open the zip. Could not find anything in google...  The problem is, I need to find out its hashvalue - for the zips hashvalue I need the zip packed with the password. So I get the hashvalue of the zip, I encrypt it and then I set the password to the zip - but then the hashvalue of the archive is another.. Is this right and expected behaviour or am I doing something wrong? I'm using the ionic zip-library and the HashAlgorithm.</p>
