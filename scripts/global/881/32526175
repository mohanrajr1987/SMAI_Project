<p>I'm very new to Powershell and especially to Powershell and ZIP files. I would like to unzip a specific file from the passed zipfile. To do so I have the code below. The code below should get a <code>*.update</code> from the zip. </p>  <p>The issue I have is that the specific file is within another folder. When running the script it seems it won't look in the folder in the zip for more files. </p>  <p>I've tried the GetFolder on the $item and/or foreach through the $item. So far no success. Anyone an idea or an direction to look in to?</p>  <pre><code>function ExtractFromZip ($File, $Destination) {     $ShellApp = new-object -com shell.application     $zipFile = $ShellApp.NameSpace($File)     foreach($item in $zipFile.Items())     {         Write-Host $item.Name          if ($item.GetFolder -ne $Null) {             Write-Host "test"         }          if ($item.Name -like "*.update") {             $ShellApp.Namespace($Destination).copyhere($item)             break;             }     } } </code></pre>
