<p>I've searched the internet regarding this topic but all the answers just made mess inside my head, because there is so much variations on how to check whether I'm connected, wheter my query is true etc. So I'm looking for some sort of quality <strong>template</strong> for connecting to DB PosegreSQL with PHP, over pg functions. Maybe I'm just giving too much emphasis on this. As Im newbie, I will have to read more about this stuff, but hopefully pure connection to DB is not related to SQL injections? </p>  <p>Here is my example: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php // Connecting to DB $host = "something1"; $user = 'something2';   $password = 'something3';   $dbname = "something4";  $dbcon = pg_connect ("host=$host dbname=$dbname user=$user password=$password") or die('Could not connect: ' . pg_last_error(). '&lt;br&gt;');  $stat = pg_connection_status($dbcon);  if (!$stat === PGSQL_CONNECTION_OK){     echo "Could not connect. &lt;br&gt;"; }  // Set the client encoding to UNICODE. $encoding = pg_set_client_encoding ($dbcon, 'utf-8');  // Setting SQL query $query = "SELECT * FROM table"; $result = pg_query($dbcon, $query) or die("Cannot execute query: $query &lt;br&gt;");;  $numrows = pg_numrows($result); $numcolum = pg_num_fields($result);  // Getting data from DB while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {   echo "A: $row[0]  B: $row[1]";   echo "&lt;br&gt;"; }  // Closing connection to DB pg_close ($dbcon); ?&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>If I'm missing something that can be included in some sort of template or if you prefer that connection is established in some sort of different way and you are experienced programer, please let me know. </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
