<p>I have large amount of list-structured data which are streaming to handler. Handler is a class which builds <code>INSERT</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> prepared statement and executes it. All prepared statements are executed in one connection and transaction for now. So, imagine  the situation that connection will be unexpectedly closed from database server, which will obviously lead application to crash. How can i reconnect to database without data loss? Am i right that if i just call <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code>, i'll lose all data from previous connection?</p>  <p>Data is a large (1-2 GB) XML containing list of unordered entries and should be uploaded to database with one transaction only, no intermediate transactions.</p>  <p>I use postgres database and jdk7. </p>
