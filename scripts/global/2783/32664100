<p>My small company has built and hosted over 300 sites. Only a select few, literally 2 or 3 have failed to load due to the max_connections setting being too low. My question is, are max_connections based on per page or per query?</p>  <p>We use a lot of Ajax to load elements and improve the user experience. Our user dashboard may send 5 Ajax calls per page and each call queries the MySql database separately. Are those considered 5 concurrent connections or 1?</p>
