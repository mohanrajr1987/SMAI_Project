<p>In our application, got a broken pipe connection exception . when we tried to resolve by validating connection using <strong>isValid()</strong> which is not working for netezza. since we are using nzjdbc.jar for driver.</p>  <p>what should i change to validate the connection which is established using netezza driver.</p>  <pre><code>        if(connection != null &amp;&amp; !connection.isValid(10)){             logger.info("Connection------&gt;");               connection = null;         }          if (connection == null || connection.isClosed()) {             Class&lt;?&gt; c = Class.forName(driver);              if (c != null) {                 connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, pass);                 logger.info("new connection created.");             }         } </code></pre>
