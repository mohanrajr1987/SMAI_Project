<p>I'm creating an application where I need to connect with a database. One thing I need to do often is to get a list of Users from the database by a groupId. </p>  <p>In every method I need this information, I make a command which retrieves the information in stead of (how I learned in school) having a separate method that gets the information and passes it on. </p>  <p>I've done this because I want to set up as few connections as possible, open at the same time. However, I'm not sure which way is best. I searched for answers on the Internet but didn't find any. What is the best way to do this?</p>  <p>If I haven't been clear enough about this issue, just ask.</p>
