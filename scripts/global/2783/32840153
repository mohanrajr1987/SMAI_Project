<p>I have my database stored inside a Data folder in my project folder but Visual Studio makes a copy of database in debug folder and reads and writes from that database while my original database is untouched. I want my application to read and write from my original database.</p>  <p>My connection string : </p>  <pre><code>Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\Data\Genesis.mdf;IntegratedSecurity=True;Connect Timeout=60 </code></pre>  <p>I then use this connection string with linq to SQL to read and write to the database</p>
