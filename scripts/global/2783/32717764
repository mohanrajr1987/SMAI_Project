<p>I am using Oracle Connection Pool UCP in the Java application to connect to Oracle. </p>  <p>My requirement is before the used connection is put back to the pool I want to do a commit on connection. But I don't want to in each method since there are lot of methods which uses this connection. And the autocommit is set to false on connection.</p>  <p>Is there any listener available in Java through which Connection Pool events like borrowed connection put back to the pool can be listened and I can add a commit on connection? </p>
