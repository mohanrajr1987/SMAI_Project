<p>I have found several answers to this question but ALL of them are answered using C#. Most of them use the following code to solve the problem:</p>  <pre><code>SqlDataSourceEnumerator instance = SqlDataSourceEnumerator.Instance; System.Data.DataTable myDataTable = instance.GetDataSources(); </code></pre>  <p>It seems pretty solid, but that class doesn't exist in java that I know of and since I have no experience on the subject I don't know a counterpart for java, so my question is: Is there a way to do this (list all available sql servers on the network) using JAVA code?</p>
