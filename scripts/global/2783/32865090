<p>I am a new student of databases so forgive my ignorance. I have installed Oracle Database 11g Express and subsequently SQL Developer.</p>  <p>I want to access the HR sample database but am getting error-12505 (TNS: Listener does not currently know of SID).</p>  <p>Firstly, I have already run the SQL command line (alter user hr account unlock;) and altered the password as per these instructions <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17781_01/admin.112/e18585/toc.htm#XEGSG121" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17781_01/admin.112/e18585/toc.htm#XEGSG121</a>. I have then opened SQL Developer and attempted to create a new connection with the following information (as per instructions here <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/issue-archive/2008/08-may/o38sql-102034.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/issue-archive/2008/08-may/o38sql-102034.html</a>):</p>  <pre><code>Connection Name: HR_ORCL  username: hr  password: (my password)  Connection type: basic  Role: default  Hostname: localhost  port: 1521  SID: orcl </code></pre>  <p>When I run a test on that it comes back <code>"Status: Failure - Test failed: Listener refused the connection with the following error: ORA-12505, TNS: Listener does not currently know of SID given in connect descriptor".</code></p>  <p>I've been through and through other peoples questions but cannot find a fix, I am sure I am making a basic error that someone with more knowledge could solve?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
