<p>I am trying to connect to an Oracle database to log in to a site.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://localhost:8288/" rel="nofollow">localhost:8288/</a>   -  runs off IIS server on my own computer</li> </ul>  <p>At my office, I can log into the site no problem. I just had my home public IP address white-listed for access and am trying to log in there. At home:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://localhost:8288/" rel="nofollow">localhost:8288/</a> gets this timeout error.</li> </ul>  <p>I am using the <strong>same laptop</strong> to log in. The only thing that changed is the IP address that I am logging in from. I don't have access to the DB (<em>client manages that</em>) but I feel like I need to get some IP addresses from them or something to configure on my end. How do I resolve this?</p>
