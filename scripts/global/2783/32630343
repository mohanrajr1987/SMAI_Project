<p>Say I have an application that wants to return information from an online database, it's a public application which anyone has free access to. What is a safe approach for these clients to communicate with the database?</p>  <p>I am interested in how this is done in professional environments. When I tried to do research all I could find were examples of clients connecting directly to the database themselves, leaving their connection strings in the code, these examples I'm sure were for server sided/private applications. But in my scenario I assume there has to be a proxy in between.</p>  <p>Do I set up a web server with PHP scripts that returns results or do I program a server that listens for TCP/IP connections? I feel there is a better way but can't lay my finger on it.</p>  <p>What my question boils down to is essentially..</p>  <p>What technique is used for this 'proxy' and client to communicate? What does the setup look like? Even a diagram would be great. Assume I am working in C#.</p>
