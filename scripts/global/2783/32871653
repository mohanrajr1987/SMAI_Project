<p>How can I obtain the creation date or time of an <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/" rel="nofollow">IBM's DB2</a> database without connecting to the specified database first? Solutions like:</p>  <pre><code>select min(create_time) from syscat.tables </code></pre>  <p>and:</p>  <pre><code>db2 list tables for schema SYSIBM </code></pre>  <p>require me to connect to the database first, like:</p>  <pre><code>db2 connect to dbname user userName using password </code></pre>  <p>Is there another way of doing this through a DB2 command instead, so I wouldn't need to connect to the database?</p>  <p>Can <code>db2look</code> command be used for that?</p>  <hr>  <p>Edit 01: Background Story</p>  <p>Since more than one person asked why do I need to do this and for what reasons, here is the background story.</p>  <p>I have a server with DB2 DBMS where many people and automated scripts are using it to create some databases for temporary tasks and tests. It's never meant to keep the data for long time. However for one reason or another (ex: developer not cleaning after himself or tests stopping forcefully before they can do the clean up) some databases never get dropped and they start to get accumulated till the hard disk is filled out eventually. So The idea of the app is to look up the age of the database and drop it, if it's older than 6 months (for example).</p>
