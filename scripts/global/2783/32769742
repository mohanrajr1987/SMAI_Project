<p>I have sql query written in c#.(DataType class has str_name and int_something). Code is like the following</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;DataType&gt; allDataType=SQLConnection.Query&lt;DataType&gt;("select str_name,int_something from sqlite_master where type = ?", type_name); </code></pre>  <p>I already got parameterless constructor inside DataType, but still I got a list of object that hasn't been initialized. str_name is empty string while int_something is always 0. But I can get the correct number of rows of data. Any hint? </p>
