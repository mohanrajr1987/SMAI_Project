<p>I am making a web application, but I also want to make it a desktop application. The problem is that my server (for security purposes) does not allow remote access to connect outside of the server unless you manually import the i.p. addresses and this will not work because it needs to allow access to everyone...so what is the solution for this?</p>  <p>Is there anyway around this issue? Please help me out. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
