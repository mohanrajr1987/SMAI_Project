<p>I have a system that I took over from another developer who did some things that are over my head. </p>  <p>We shut down one server that we didn't think was doing anything. </p>  <p>Turns out... the production database is somehow attempting to connect to the server that was shut down. </p>  <p>When I restart mysql, it get the error that it </p>  <blockquote>   <p>unable to connect to foreign data source: Cant' connect to MYSQL server on (ip address)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am unable to access the database using HeidiSql. I can run queries against it, but can't view it. </p>  <p>The other db was on a vps that is GONE! </p>  <p>Is there anyone that can help me understand what might be going on here... and whether I can recover from this?</p>  <p>HELP!!!!!!</p>
