<p>When I attempt to add a new database connection via the Server Explorer->Connect to Database option I am presented with the following image upon clicking OK.  If I click "Test Connection" then the entire dialog disappears without apparently doing anything.  How can I successfully add a connection to a database?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GOm1U.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GOm1U.png" alt="Add Database Connection Wizard Dialog"></a></p>  <p><strong>Update</strong><br> Interestingly I found that if I check the "Advanced" tab the connection information including username and password is not filled in.  Populating those fields allows me to complete the dialog but I am then presented with this error in the Output window.</p>  <p><code> System.Data.ProviderIncompatibleException: The provider did not return a ProviderManifestToken string. ---> Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleException: ORA-1005: null password given; logon denied </code></p>  <p>From this it seems that the dialog is not passing the information properly.  </p>
