<p>6 months back I wrote a rails app (craigslist scraper) and all of the code was pushed to github and then deployed to heroku. Since this time I got a new laptop and am getting back into learning code. I am trying to get the same app running locally on my machine but am getting an error that no DB is connected (( <code>Rails.application.database_configuration</code>: Could not load database configuration. No such file )) how can I download the DB file from GitHub or get the DB going again and run a fresh scrape? thanks in advance! </p>
