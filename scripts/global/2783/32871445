<p>I understand that this is an ambiguous question however I have been tasked to assess the feasibility of direct data transfer between inter-departmental electronic data platforms in an aggregate format for the purposes of quality improvement, reporting and research purposes. </p>  <p>Ideally, clinicians should be able to access or request information from any of the hospitals databases as they so please without much lag time about a particular patient.</p>  <p>(e.g. Doctor is looking at patient X and requests information from various databases. What would be the most effective way of doing this without creating 1 gigantic database with all of the information from various departments)</p>  <p>I am not looking for anything specific, but just some general guidance and pointing in the right direction as to what I should be looking into, the general structure of how this would work.</p>  <p>Any help is very much appreciated!</p>
