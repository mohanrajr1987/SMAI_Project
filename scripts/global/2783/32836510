<p>I am writing a Python script to fetch and update some data on a remote oracle database from a Linux server. I would like to know how can I connect to remote oracle database from the server.<br> Do I necessarily need to have an oracle client installed on my server or any connector can be used for the same?<br> And also if I use <code>cx_Oracle</code> module in Python, is there any dependency that has to be fulfilled for making it work?</p>
