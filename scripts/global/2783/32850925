<p>I am trying to login into the database and the following error is coming up. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nmkap.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nmkap.jpg" alt="Login Issue"></a></p>  <p>On searching I found that there is no space available as shown below:  </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Arpkz.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Arpkz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The issue is I am not able to login into the database to resolve this problem. I am able to login into the Linux machine where oracle server is installed but logging in as a DBA is not happening. For that, I tried <code>sqlplus / as sysdba</code> but the same issue is coming up as shown in the first picture.<br> I think this might be an issue of a lot of archive logs but I don't understand how do I check archive logs without having access to database. Following are my questions:<br> 1. If archivelogs is the actual issue, how can we delete all the logs from the Linux machine without getting access to the database? Also how would we disable the generation of archive logs?<br> 2. If this is not a correct solution, how would this issue be solved?<br> Thanks in advance!</p>
