<p>I've added an access db to my project as a datasource. So I get the automatically generated tableadapters class and therefore, access to the table adapter instance which includes the connection string. I'm using this to open a connection to my db so I can first, delete some records, and then replace them with new records. The queries seem to work because the <code>.executenonquery</code> does return the rows affected. I even tried a <code>delete *</code> command to be sure. But, when I open the database everything is the same. I had some ideas as to why.  I thought the connection string returned by the tableadapter might be goofy because it contains a generic pointer to the project's data directory. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=|<strong>DataDirectory</strong>|\DupeMDB.mdb;Persist Security Info=True</p> </blockquote>  <p>I also thought maybe I had a problem with the Build Action or the Copy to Output Directory. I really don't understand the mechanics behind these two things.  I think maybe the copy to output directory thing might be the culprit.</p>  <p>Here's me goal.  I want to deploy this project to my secretary so she can use the program to deal with a duplicate record list etc.  The data has to go with the program. I want to package this <em>.mdf</em> file with the deployment and get it back from her when she's done with it. I am so close to the end here (writing back to the table).  Does anyone know why the table won't update?</p>  <pre><code>    Dim Connector As DupeTblTableAdapter = New DupeTblTableAdapter     Dim Conn As New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection     Conn = Connector.Connection     Conn.ConnectionString = Connector.Connection.ConnectionString     MsgBox(Conn.ConnectionString)     Dim Comm As System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand      Conn.Open()     For Each DR In DeleteRecords         Comm = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand($"DELETE from DupeTbl where DupeTbl.CUST_NO={DR.ToString}", Conn) '         Dim aff As Integer = Comm.ExecuteNonQuery         'MsgBox(aff)         Comm = Nothing     Next     For Each RR In ReplaceRecords         Comm = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand($"INSERT INTO DupeTbl ( CUST_NO, PREDIR, POSTDIR, SUFFIX, CUSTSIZE, AddFlag, IgnoreRecord ) VALUES ({RR.Cust_No}, '{RR.PreDir}', '{RR.PostDir}', '{RR.Suffix}', {RR.Size}, {RR.AddFlag}, {RR.Ignore});", Conn)         Comm.ExecuteNonQuery()         Comm = Nothing     Next      Conn.Close() </code></pre>
