<p>I noticed that min/max values that are fed to a custom tickPositioner function are not the same as min/max values of the data set. For example, my max value when chart is downloaded as CSV is 353116.2853, but max value provided to the tickPositioner is 390819.334993875.</p>  <p>Similarly, min value in the dataset is -400944.7087, but tickPositioner receives  -438647.758392375.</p>  <p>Is this a bug?</p>
