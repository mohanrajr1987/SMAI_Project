<p>This is really frustrating.. I am using Highcharts to generate BaRCharts for some of my categories.</p>  <p>On Large screen screens it works really well. But on small screen Category label is overlapping the bar as shown below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dPZai.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dPZai.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I tried changing widths but <code>overlap</code> issue does not solve.</p>  <p>JSFiddle is here <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/dp2gmqf1/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a></p>  <p>Please let me know help. this BAR and Label is getting generated dynamically by <code>Highcharts API</code>    </p>
