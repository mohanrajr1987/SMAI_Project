<p>I'm playing around with the properties of a chart I created in Highcharts, and I'd like to know what attributes are associated with the <code>legend.labelFormat</code> property. I know that <code>{name}</code> is one that definitely works, but I can't find documentation regarding any other attributes that can be used.</p>  <p>I suppose that I'm looking for something similar to the <code>tooltip.pointFormat</code> property, where you can use attributes like <code>{point.value}</code>, <code>{point.percentage}</code>, and so on.</p>  <p>What makes me think that additional properties other than <code>{name}</code> exist is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14754823/add-series-total-to-legend-in-highcharts">this thread</a> in which the user mentions using <code>this.options.total</code> in the <code>legend.labelFormatter</code> property.</p>  <p>Can anyone help?</p>
