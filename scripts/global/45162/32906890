<p>I am using a High Chart component created using React. I have to write a test for it, and the infrastructure is Jasmine/Karma/React TestUtils. </p>  <p>I have written the following code:</p>  <pre><code>const component: React.Component&lt;{}, {}&gt; = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(             &lt;EmailActivityBreakdown trendData={trendData}/&gt;         ); </code></pre>  <p>I am consistenly getting Error#13 <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/errors/13" rel="nofollow">http://www.highcharts.com/errors/13</a> (when instantiating the chart component inside the "EmailActivityBreakdown" object). </p>  <p>Things work fine generally with the component, (i.e. in non-test case mode). How can I create the chart element with a 'renderTo' inside the ReactTest framework to work?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
