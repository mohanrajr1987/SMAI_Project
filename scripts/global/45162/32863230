<p>I just can't see how to stack the series for the drilldown. Do I add the drilldown chunks as:</p>  <pre><code>drilldown = [{name: 'bob',               data: [series1, series2,series3],               id: drilldown_id}] </code></pre>  <p>Currently <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#drilldown.series" rel="nofollow">the docs</a> seems to indicate to add all the series in the data series, but I'm not getting it working. Currently don't have a jsfiddle as everything I'm doing is in Python, but can provide one if need be.</p>  <p>Update: I understand from the docs that the series plotoptions for the drilldown are inherited from the parent series -- please correct me if this is wrong. I currently have multiple series with the same id, but they are not stacking currently.</p>
