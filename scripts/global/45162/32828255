<p>I have a HighCharts.js graph where when clicking a button, setData is called that adds another data point.</p>  <p>I was hoping to change that animation that brings it from 0 to the current next data point, to instead just animate smoothly from left to right as if it is just filling/expanding. Exact animation is shown when it loads.</p>  <p>I have setData simply as follows where the animation attribute is set to true.</p>  <pre><code>series.setData(data, true, true); </code></pre>  <p>I created this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/44ejxsaa/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/44ejxsaa/1/</a> to create a simple example of the animation I am getting. Please click the button a few times to see.</p>
