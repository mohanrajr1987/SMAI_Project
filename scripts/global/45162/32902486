<p>Having a chart type line, where I have drawn points on the same point x with y but different, I should bring up the tooltip on the various points, but unfortunately when I pass with the mouse on the chart appears to me only one of the marks painted on the same x, ignoring the other. The graph is on: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jsd96atf/" rel="nofollow">enter link description here</a> I tried, but unfortunately I have not found anything to solve my problem. And 'possible to bring up the tooltip on all points? Thank you all for the help.</p>  <pre><code>.. </code></pre>  <p>david</p>
