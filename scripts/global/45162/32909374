<p>I'm trying to finish work from a sick colleague but my json knowledge is so poor I just can't seem to get this tooltip working properly. </p>  <p>The data to build up the points for a highchart is being written in json as: </p>  <pre><code>"data": {         "parties": [             [ 48, 138, 130, 84, 82, 72, 65, 55, 40, -40]         ]     } </code></pre>  <p>with each data point, I should be able to write some additional data. I found some other stackoverflows which has lead me to something that works for me to call the Mydata in the tooltip, except for: Mydata is not defined (in the json) yet.</p>  <pre><code> tooltip: {         formatter: function () {             return 'Extra data: &lt;b&gt;' + this.point.myData + '&lt;/b&gt;'; </code></pre>  <p>I've put up a fiddle where you can look into the complete json and javascript here: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/vmt66qb3/1/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/vmt66qb3/1/</a></p>  <p>I really can't seem to get it working without breaking things, I hope this is enough information as I can't provide a working link of the client but if you need more information, please ask.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
