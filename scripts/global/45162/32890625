<p>Looking at the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.9.1/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/stock/demo/dynamic-update/" rel="nofollow">standard Highstock dynamic update demo</a> in Chrome DevTools' Timeline panel, I noticed something (apparently) strange: for every call to <code>Series#addPoint</code>, Highstock seemingly calls <code>Chart#redraw</code> <em>twice</em>, and both times it goes all the way down to <code>Series#render</code>, so the time spent in the <code>redraw</code> calls is not trivial (exact numbers at the end).</p>  <p>See the flame chart below for a visual representation of the stack. The important methods are highlighted in red. The stack goes from top-to-bottom and left-to-right, i.e.,functions at the top call those below them, and time flows from left to right.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QRXsB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QRXsB.png" alt="Highcharts double redraw flame chart"></a></p>  <p>The exact time spent in the important methods is as follows (this is total time, including all methods called from the method):</p>  <ul> <li>47 ms taken by <code>addPoint</code>, of which  <ul> <li>45 ms taken by the 1st call to <code>Chart#redraw</code>, of which  <ul> <li>40 ms taken by the 1st call to <code>Series#redraw</code>, of which  <ul> <li>2.5 ms taken by the 1st call to <code>Series#render</code> and</li> <li><strong>24 ms</strong> taken by the 2nd call to <code>Chart#redraw</code>, of which  <ul> <li>13 ms taken by the 2nd call to <code>Series#redraw</code>, of which  <ul> <li>7 ms taken by the 2nd call to <code>Series#render</code></li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>Considering that 32 ms is all I have if I want an acceptable rendering rate of 30 fps, that 24 ms for the second <code>Chart#redraw</code> really bothers me. So my question is: does Highcharts really need that second <code>redraw</code>, or is it duplicating work? If it is not, why is the double call needed?</p>
