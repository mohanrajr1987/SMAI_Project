<p>I have some values for showing in my chart:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UDJm3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UDJm3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But between 10th and 16th of september there is no measurement. I want that that period goes to 0.</p>  <p>Is it possible?</p>
