<p>When I click the blue slice, it'll bring me to a drilldown of 3 slices. When I return from it, the color of a single slice has changed. It doesn't matter what color I change it to it always changes and it's always the same one.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/e0cPF.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/e0cPF.jpg" alt="Start"></a>, <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gb6gM.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gb6gM.jpg" alt="Drilldown"></a>, <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HYhXx.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HYhXx.jpg" alt="Return"></a></p>  <p>This is a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ng1kvmxh/21/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a> of my code but the problem doesn't occur here.
