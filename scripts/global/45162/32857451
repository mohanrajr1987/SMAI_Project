<p>I'm really struggling with this. I want to display a bubble chart with highcharts, i'm calling the data via Ajax and it's being sent in a JSON. The point is, i can't get to format well the data. I can send one value, but i need three or more (by know, i'm only interested in the first 3 that are the x and the y axis, and the z value which is the radius of the bubble. Here's what i've tried so far in PHP: </p>  <pre><code>$category = array(); $category['name'] = 'Month';  $series1 = array(); $series1['name'] = 'Muy negativo'; $series1['color'] = '#FF0000';  $series2 = array(); $series2['name'] = 'Neutral'; $series2['color'] = '#696969';  $series3 = array(); $series3['name'] = 'Positivo';  $series3['color'] = '#00CC00';    $series1["data"] = array();  // Push the data into the array      while($row = mysql_fetch_array($query)) {     array_push($series1["data"], array(         'x' =&gt; $row["wordpress"],         "y" =&gt; $row["codeigniter"],         "z" =&gt; $row["highcharts"]         )     );     $series2['data'][] = $row['codeigniter']; $series3['data'][x][] = $row['highcharts']; $series3['data'][y][] = $row['wordpress'];      }   $result = array(); array_push($result,$category); /*This is from an example, another thing is i don't really want to have a category, but if i get rid of these, nothing appears. I've tried deleting the category on the javascript that generates the bubble chart part and also  the send of this information but it didn't      work.*/ array_push($result,$series1); array_push($result,$series2); array_push($result,$series3);   print json_encode($result, JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK); </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, in the first try, i push the values and i get this JSON, but the data is not displayed by the bubble chart, i think this is ok, but somehow, don't  work:</p>  <pre><code>{"name":"Muy negativo","color":"#FF0000","data":[{"x":4,"y":5,"z":7}, {"x":5,"y":2,"z":8},{"x":6,"y":3,"z":9},{"x":2,"y":6,"z":6}, {"x":5,"y":7,"z":7},{"x":7,"y":1,"z":10},{"x":2,"y":2,"z":9}, {"x":1,"y":6,"z":7},{"x":6,"y":6,"z":7},{"x":7,"y":4,"z":9}, {"x":3,"y":6,"z":8},{"x":4,"y":3,"z":4}]} </code></pre>  <p>In the second series, it's the only that i made to work, it returns this JSON and the data is displayed in the bubble chart: </p>  <pre><code>{"name":"Neutral","color":"#696969","data":{"x":[5,2,3,6,7,1,2,6,6,4,6,3]}} </code></pre>  <p>And in the third attempt, the JSON is sent like this: </p>  <pre><code>{"name":"Positivo","color":"#00CC00","data":{"x":[7,8,9,6,7,10,9,7,7,9,8,4],"y":[4,5,6,2,5,7,2,1,6,7,3,4]} </code></pre>  <p>Here's the javascript that generates the chart: </p>  <pre><code>$('#button').click(function() { var dato = $('#idnumbah').val();       $.post( "data.php", {numbah: ""+dato}, function() {      })       .done(function() {         alert( "data sent");       })       .fail(function() {         alert( "error" );       })       .always(function() {     });     var options = {     chart: {         renderTo: 'chart2',         type: 'bubble',         marginRight: 130,         marginBottom: 25     },     title: {         text: 'Project Requests',         x: -20 //center     },     subtitle: {         text: '',         x: -20     },     xAxis: {         categories: []     },     yAxis: {         title: {             text: 'Requests'         },         plotLines: [{             value: 0,             width: 1,             color: '#808080'         }]     },     tooltip: {         formatter: function() {                 return '&lt;b&gt;'+ this.series.name +'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'+                 this.x +': '+ this.y;         }     },     series: [{name: 'Muy positivo', color: "FF0000"}] }  $.getJSON("data.php", function(json) {     options.xAxis.categories = json[0]['data'];     options.series[0] = json[1];     options.series[1] = json[2];     options.series[2] = json[3];     chart = new Highcharts.Chart(options); }); }); </code></pre>  <p>In the HTML, apart from all the necessary dependencies, i have this div were the chart is being loaded. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="chart2" class="myChart" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Actually, i do need five series, here's an example of another one i made that works, in this case the data is static so it's created in the same archive, but now i have dinamic data, anyways, here's how the data series have to be received: </p>  <pre><code>series: [{         data: [{x:0.5, y: 2, z:20, name:'LD', country:'López Dóriga'},{x:1, y: 2, z:20, name:'LD', country:'López Dóriga'},{x:2, y: 2, z:20, name:'LD', country:'López Dóriga'},{x:6, y: 2, z:20, name:'A', country:'Anwar'},], color:"#00FF00", name:'Muy Positivo',     }, {         data: [{x:1.5, y: 1, z:10, name:'LD', country:'López Dóriga'},], color:"#33CC33", name:'Positivo',      }, {         data: [{x:4, y: 0, z:0, name:'A', country:'Anwar'},{x:4.5, y: 0, z:0, name:'B', country:'Biby'},{x:5, y: 0, z:0, name:'A', country:'Anwar'},{x:5.5, y: 0, z:0, name:'A', country:'Anwar'},], color:"#999966", name:'Neutral',      },     {         data: [{x:2.5, y: -1, z:-10, name:'LD', country:'López Dóriga'},{x:3, y: -1, z:-10, name:'A', country:'Anwar'},], color:"#FF6600", name:'Negatvo',      }, {         data: [{x:3.5, y: -2, z:-20, name:'A', country:'Anwar'},], color:"#FF0000", name:'Muy negativo',      }] </code></pre>  <p>I've tried so hard and searched through the internet, but bubble charts seems to be largely missing; the chart is generated after a click, because i need to add some inputs to send information to the php and retrieve information based on that. I'm very new in to JSON and this stuff, so i would be very grateful if you help me to solve this or share ideas to start in different ways. Thanks in advance. </p>  <p>Here's the complete JSON, i think the first (the one called "Muy negativo") is the most accurated, the other two are just to show the other approaches i've tried. </p>  <pre><code>[{"name":"Month"},{"name":"Muy negativo","color":"#FF0000","data": [{"x":4,"y":5,"z":7},{"x":5,"y":2,"z":8},{"x":6,"y":3,"z":9}, {"x":2,"y":6,"z":6},{"x":5,"y":7,"z":7},{"x":7,"y":1,"z":10}, {"x":2,"y":2,"z":9},{"x":1,"y":6,"z":7},{"x":6,"y":6,"z":7}, {"x":7,"y":4,"z":9},{"x":3,"y":6,"z":8},{"x":4,"y":3,"z":4}]}, {"name":"Neutral","color":"#696969","data":[5,2,3,6,7,1,2,6,6,4,6,3]}, {"name":"Positivo","color":"#00CC00","data":{"x": [7,8,9,6,7,10,9,7,7,9,8,4],"y":[4,5,6,2,5,7,2,1,6,7,3,4]}}] </code></pre>
