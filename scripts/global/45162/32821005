<p>Is it possible to set different colors for y-axis values in the below chart ? <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.9.1/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/column-stacked/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.9.1/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/column-stacked/</a></p>  <p>I want to have different colors for the text displayed on y-axis (0,2.5,7.5...). Is this possible ?</p>  <p>I have tried with </p>  <pre><code> yAxis labels: {                  style: {                     color: 'red'                 } </code></pre>  <p>but it applies for the entire y-axis, i want individual colors for each value as described above. </p>  <p>Thanks for your time !</p>
