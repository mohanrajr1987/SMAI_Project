<p>I'm working with High Charts (<a href="http://www.highcharts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.highcharts.com/</a>) to get some interactive charts for my webpage. I'm attempting to create a timeline of sorts using a column range chart and a bunch of series. </p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/asrm5zL0/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/asrm5zL0/</a></p>  <pre><code>dataLabels: {                 enabled: true,                 align: 'middle',                 crop: false,                 style: {                     fontWeight: 'bold'                 },                 verticalAlign: 'middle',                 formatter: function () { return 'CenterThis' }             } </code></pre>  <p>Currently I've created the above example. I've been trying to find a way to center the labels for a given series in the bar itself, however it seems to always want to label each data point. Is there a simple way to do this that I'm not seeing? The high charts documentation for series (<a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#plotOptions.series.dataLabels" rel="nofollow">http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#plotOptions.series.dataLabels</a>) didn't seem to have a property for this sort of thing.</p>  <p>Thank you for any help.</p>
