<p>I currently have a dataframe called minuteDataPlot in which I am trying to plot with highcharts in rCharts</p>  <pre><code>users      timestamp 1276   2015-10-03 09:00:00 1292   2015-10-03 09:01:00 1306   2014-10-03 09:02:00 </code></pre>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>a &lt;- hPlot(users ~ timestamp, data = minuteDataPlot,            type = 'spline', title = 'SBK Users per Minute', subtitle = 'Real-Time') a$global(useUTC = FALSE) a$xAxis(type='datetime') a </code></pre>  <p>The class for <code>minuteDataPlot$timestamp</code>is POSIXlt. My result is</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0fMV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0fMV.png" alt="highchart attempt with mydatetime"></a></p>  <p>You can see that the x-axis does not reflect my timestamp data. I would expect something something similar to my timestamps (e.g 2015-10-03 09:00:00).</p>  <p>I have tried using numeric class as well, but I get the same result. Any help would be grand. I have checked the highcharts documentation as well of course and I can't seem to find any help there.</p>
