<p>I am really appreciate the rCharts package that being created to do many cool stuff, really like it a lot. Besides, i am very interested to use R to plot the grouped_categories charts (Highcharts) by blacklabel (refer to the link below).</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/blacklabel/grouped_categories" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/blacklabel/grouped_categories</a></p>  <p>Example of the grouped_categories in json format:</p>  <pre><code>xAxis: {     categories: [{         name: "Fruit",         categories: ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]     }, {         name: "Vegetable",         categories: ["Carrot", "Potato", "Tomato"]     }, {         name: "Fish",         categories: ["Cod", "Salmon", "Tuna"]     }] } </code></pre>  <p>Can you let me know is rCharts package able to do so? If yes, can you show me some simple example R code for the grouped_categories chart just for my reference?</p>  <p>appreciate and thanks</p>
