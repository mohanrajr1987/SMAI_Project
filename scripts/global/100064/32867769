<p>So I just started out with the Ionic Framework. And I am trying to add a background image. But when I run the application in the browser, I don't see the image. In my console I get a 404 error. I believe my path is correct. I followed this <a href="https://blog.nraboy.com/2015/04/adding-background-images-to-ionic-framework-apps/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> after I was not sure if my css was correct. Which is basically the same as I have got. So does anybody know what the problem is exactly?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpCPJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpCPJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Part of my html code is the following:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;div class="logo"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And my css is the following: </p>  <pre><code>.logo{     background-image: url('../img/logo.jpg');     background-repeat: no-repeat;     background-size: contain;     background-position: center;     width: 80%;     height: 246px;     margin: auto;     z-index: 2;     position: relative; } </code></pre>
