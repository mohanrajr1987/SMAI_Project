<p>I am building a cordova based app using ionic framework. We tested the app in browser and android. It is working well but when I try in iphone with recent version of IOS, all the ui is distorted. How do I avoid or solve this ui distortion issue?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HHs0B.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HHs0B.png" alt="Iphone screenshot"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aISPF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aISPF.png" alt="browser screenshot"></a></p>
