<p>Can someone point me to a plugin or a code snippet to implement both Facebook and Google login in my Ionic + Phonegap Build app ?</p>  <p>It must also work as a pure webapp (in a desktop browser).</p>  <p>I would like this feature to be able to log from the native facebook or google+ apps that the user has already installed on his device, so he doesn't need to retype his id+password. But, if these apps are not installed, the code must fallback on the normal login process.</p>  <p>My app communicate with a cloudant database using pouchDB in case you need this information.</p>  <p>(I have to use Phonegap Build because I don't work on a mac).</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
