<p>On one of my pages (which has   <pre><code>&lt;button class="button button-small button-balanced" data-ion-modal="reviewPopup"&gt;     leave review &lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>  <p>in that Modal I have a form that, when I click a button for, should send data to the server from both the Modal and the template from template a. I can get data from the form in the Modal just fine, but I can't access any data from the calling page (specifically I need the <code>_id</code>). Calling <code>Template.parentData</code> just returns null.</p>
