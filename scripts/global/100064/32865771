<p>I have four buttons which are right-aligned on the navigation bar and title in center. The title text is bigger and it's overlapping with right buttons. How can I set title width so that it shows the three ellipses when text is overflowing?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0QspY.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0QspY.jpg" alt="Check screenshot to see what i actually saying."></a></p>
