<p>I've used the ionic tabs sample to create a basic app, where I display a list of results in one tab, and the details of a selection in the other tab. This works fine most of the time and I can see the hash fragment value change correctly to <code>#tab/games/companyname/0</code> and when I click on the back button, the hash value changes back to <code>#tab/games</code></p>  <p>The problem is, in some instances (the issue seems to occur when the data size is larger), on back click, the hash value does not change to <code>#tab/games</code> despite the initial list view tab being shown for a brief moment, after which the view shown before back button was shown is displayed.</p>  <p>If you keep on clicking the back button, the hash value is eventually correct and the list view is displayed.</p>  <p>The same issue happens other way around when trying to navigate from the list view to detail view -> <code>#tab/games</code> to <code>#tab/games/companyname/0</code></p>  <p>If I override the hash value to what it should be inside a handler for the <code>$ionicView.enter</code> event, then, the wrong view still flashes but eventually the correct view is shown. </p>  <p>I've now hardcoded a data set of 5 results to try and identify when the issue begins and it seems that it does not happen for 5 items, but for 30 items, even if the data is hardcoded(not retrieved using an http request), the issue still happens.</p>  <p>Does any one have any ideas around what may be causing this issue?</p>  <pre><code> $stateProvider  .state('tab', {       url: '/tab',       abstract: true,       templateUrl: 'templates/games.html'   })  .state('tab.games', {     url: '/games',     views: {         'tab-games': {             templateUrl: 'templates/tab-games.html',             controller: 'GamesCtrl'         }     } })   .state('tab.game-detail', {       url: '/games/:SourceId/:GameIndex',       views: {           'tab-news': {               templateUrl: 'templates/game-detail.html',               controller: 'GameDetailCtrl'           }       }   }); </code></pre>  <p><a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-tabs" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-tabs</a></p>
