<p>My app is build with Ionic / Cordova 5.0.0 - Using SQLite (PouchDB) for the majority of the data, and localStorage for preferences and what not. </p>  <p>Out of 300+ iOS users, I've had 4 users report complete data loss. The app simply reset to the original state as if Localstorage and the Websql data was blown out completely. All of these users are on iOS and running 8.4.* </p>  <p>I've tried to reproduce the problem by manually deleting all localstorage, which resets the app as expected, but the SQLite data remains. I simply cannot figure out anyway to reproduce this, let alone figure out how it could be happening. </p>  <p>Note: I haven't had any reports from Android. </p>  <p>Any ideas? </p>
