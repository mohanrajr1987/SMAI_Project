<p>I am using Ionic Framework to develop my App. It just has a few templates and I am using Ionic Serve command to test the app in the web browser. It seems to work fine with smooth transitions between pages, but using Ionic View app on my iphone and testing the app it has a choppy transition sometimes.</p>  <p>Here the proof: Look at second 8 <a href="https://youtu.be/1vaOMtBn2Pk" rel="nofollow">Youtube Video</a></p>  <p>What can I do to improve those transitions?</p>
