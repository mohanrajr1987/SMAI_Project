<p>I am using ionic to develop hybrid app. But recently I found that whenever I click on the hardware back button, the app will exit no matter on which page. I tried to add the following code, it does shows the alert box but this doesn't stop the app from exit (alert box is not clicked).</p>  <pre><code>$ionicPlatform.onHardwareBackButton(function() {   alert("click on hardware back button");  } </code></pre>  <p>How can I prevent the app from exit from hardware back button?</p>
