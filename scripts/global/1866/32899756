<p>I create a core in solr 5.3 using haystack for my django application and try to do <code>python manage.py rebuild_index</code>, it just gives this error message. The part <code>/update/?commit=true</code> looks strange for me. I try to manually change it to <code>/update?commit=true</code>, but still does not work. In browser, it just says 404. Anyone has any idea on it? Thanks!</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to clear Solr index: Failed to connect to server at   '<a href="http://localhost:8983/solr/#/my_core/update/?commit=true" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8983/solr/#/my_core/update/?commit=true</a>', are you   sure that URL is correct? Checking it in a browser might help:   HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8983): Max retries exceeded   with url: /solr/ (Caused by : [Errno 111]   Connection refused)</p> </blockquote>
