<p>My catalog has a lot of products, so sometimes there are a lot of search results by some queries. Solr have its own field 'score', and our customer wants to limit search results by limiting 'score' value. For example, if we set 'limit score value' to 500, then in search result should be only products which score > 500. (I know this is a bad practice).  I tried google a lot on it, tried to edit edismax and etc.</p>  <p>So my question, how can i do this? </p>
