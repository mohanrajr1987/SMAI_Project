<p>We plan to use MySQL as the RDBMS in web app. But also send the data to Solr to support faster search. I am seeking advice on which methodology is recommended and why: </p>  <ol> <li>Set up a cron job for periodic update (say every 30 min) - most tutorials seem to suggest this.</li> <li><strong>OR</strong> during <code>http post</code>, send data to both mySQL and Solr.</li> </ol>  <p>The app will have user posted comments and different range attributes requiring full text search and facets.</p>  <p>Edit:  For those who find their way to this topic, solr wiki has a brief write up on this at <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPerformanceFactors" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPerformanceFactors</a></p>
