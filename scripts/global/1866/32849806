<p>I don't know anything about solr, just trying to figure out if I can use it in my project to do mass look-ups.</p>  <p>I've seen a link that seems to suggest there is a way to do mass-indexing of data using <a href="https://docs.lucidworks.com/display/lweug/Using+Pig+with+LucidWorks+Search" rel="nofollow">Pig</a>.  However, I haven't seen anything that seems to suggest I can do a mass look up.</p>  <p>Would I write a UDF that takes a key and then through Java connect to Solr and execute a query?</p>  <p>What are my options?</p>
