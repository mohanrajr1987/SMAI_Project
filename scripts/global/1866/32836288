<p>I have been scratching my head for over a day now trying to fix this. This is the definition of field type in schema.xml</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;fieldType name="text_plain" class="solr.TextField" positionIncrementGap="100"&gt;         &lt;analyzer type="index"&gt;             &lt;tokenizer class="solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory" /&gt;         &lt;/analyzer&gt;         &lt;analyzer type="query"&gt;             &lt;tokenizer class="solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory" /&gt;         &lt;/analyzer&gt;     &lt;/fieldType&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have indexed, among others, a field like "Unity is great" (without double quotes). If I search "Unity", I do get the result. If I search "Unity ", I get all results that are indexed (I believe this is because the whitespace got indexed). If I search "Unity i", I get nothing. I am trying to search with a query like this: fieldName: nameParam*, where nameParam is the search query parameter and fieldName is the field that has been indexed.</p>  <p>What I want is to get the results for the exact phrase, like when I search with query "Unity i", I want just one result.</p>
