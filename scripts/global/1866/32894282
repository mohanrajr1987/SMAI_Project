<p>I am trying to delete documents based on some attributes. Earlier I was deleting documents from Solr using id as the only field which was working fine.</p>  <p>Now, I have to delete documents based on two fields. For eg,  if I have a document :             {"id":239,"name":"abc", "city":"def"} I want to delete this document using the following query :</p>  <pre><code>http://".SOLRSERVER.":".SOLRPORT."/solr/update?stream.body=%3Cdelete%3E%3Cquery%3Ename%3A".$name"%20AND%20city%3A".$city."%3C/query%3E%3C/delete%3E&amp;commit=true"; </code></pre>  <p>it is similar to:          <code>&lt;delete&gt;&lt;query&gt;name: $name AND city =$city &lt;/query&gt;&lt;/delete&gt;</code></p>  <p>This is working fine on my windows machine but when I am trying to delete from a remove linux machine, it is making no change.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me out please? </p>
