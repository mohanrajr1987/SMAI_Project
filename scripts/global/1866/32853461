<p>Just starting to play with Solr.  I can't figure out how to show matched-snippet of a <code>txt</code> document.</p>  <p>I followed this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18469175/solr-highlighting-display-snippet">post</a>, but although I have 1 document that match my query I do not see snippet in highlighting.</p>  <p>Here is how I got into this mess:</p>  <ul> <li>Start Solr: <code>/opt/solr/bin/solr start -e cloud -noprompt</code></li> <li>/opt/solr/bin/post -c gettingstarted ~/Tmp/my.txt</li> <li>In admin-ui query I issue a query.</li> <li>The query string is: <code>http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted_shard1_replica2/select?q=*max*&amp;wt=json&amp;indent=true&amp;hl=true&amp;hl.fl=content&amp;hl.simple.pre=%3Cem%3E&amp;hl.simple.post=%3C%2Fem%3E</code></li> <li>The response I see "numFound": 1...docs:[{id:'my-home-dir/Tmp/my.txt'}]</li> <li>In "highlighting": {'my-home-dir/Tmp/my.txt':{}}</li> </ul>  <p>I think the core problem is that I don't know what fields are being generated in the background...somehow I think this should be way easier to work with out of the box...</p>  <p>If you could tell me what field name I should expect that would be great.</p>  <p>If you could tell me how to get a snippet back that would also be great.</p>
