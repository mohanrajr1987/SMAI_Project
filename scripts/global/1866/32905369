<p>I am running Solr 5.3.0 and I have created a new core using the command bin/solr create -c collection1.</p>  <p>However, I noticed there is no schema.xml file anywhere for that core in the collection1/conf folder.</p>  <p>Do I need to create the schema.xml from scratch each time I create a new core?</p>  <p>What is the best way to do this? Copy the one from {SOLR_INSTALLATION}/server/solr/configsets\basic_configs\conf and modify the schema.xml to suit my needs?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
