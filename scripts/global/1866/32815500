<p>I followed this article <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27168091/how-to-index-data-from-mongodb-to-solr-4-7">How to index data from mongodb to solr 4.7</a> and used this connector <a href="https://github.com/james75/SolrMongoImporter/downloads" rel="nofollow">SolrMongoImporter</a> and was successfully able to import data from MongoDB to Solr. However most of the data that I practically need is in nested JSON format. I am not finding a way to import for example "<code>city</code>" field in the below JSON data.  </p>  <pre><code>{ "id":"1", "merchantname": "merch1", "category": "restaurant", "address": {     "addressline1": "1111 Washington Ave",     "city": "saint louis",     "state": "MO",     "pin": "63103",     "latitude": "37.632481",     "longitute": "-80.199249"  } } </code></pre>  <p>Would appreciate any pointers on this. </p>
