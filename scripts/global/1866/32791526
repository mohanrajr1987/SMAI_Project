<p>I'm trying to use DIH to import data from MySQL to SOLR, my query is made of join and left outer joins like:</p>  <pre><code>   select * from products    join merchants on merchants.id=products.merchant_id                                   left outer join cats_products on products.id=cats_products.product_id      join categories on cats_products.category_id=categories.id; </code></pre>  <p>,when I use join everything is ok,but when I want to make use of left outer join it takes a long time,and after a long time it returns nothing and gets out of time, I found something about using <strong>batchSize</strong> but when I change the number for this parameter it makes no differences, so one of my question is that why it have no affect?<strong>batchSize="30000"</strong> for example.</p>  <p>then I came up to use <strong>limit</strong> in my query and use lots of entity in my dih config with differente limits like:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;entity name="first" query="select * from table LIMIT 0, 5000"&gt;  ....  &lt;/entity&gt;  &lt;entity name="second" query="select * from table LIMIT 5000, 10000"&gt;  ... &lt;/entity&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but I have a huge amount of data and I can't use it for my full import. so I was wondering maybe there should be some other ways to try,I mean to fetch data from data base in chunks or ... any idea would be appreciated.</p>
