<p>I've recently swapped from using Lucene for Sitecore to Solr.</p>  <p>For the most part it has been smooth, but the way I was writing some queries (using Sitecore.ContentSearch.Linq) abstraction now don't seem to be compatible.</p>  <p>Specifically, I have a situation where I've got "global" content and "regional" content, like so:</p>  <ul> <li>Home (000)  <ul> <li>X</li> <li>Y</li> <li>Z</li> </ul></li> <li>Regions (ID: 111)  <ul> <li>Region 1 (ID: 221)  <ul> <li>A</li> <li>B</li> </ul></li> <li>Region 2 (ID: 222)  <ul> <li>D</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>My code worked on Lucene, but now doesn't on Solr. It should find all "global" and a single region's content, excluding all other region's content. So as an example, if the user's current region was Region 1, I'd want the query to return content X, Y, Z, A, B.</p>  <p>Sitecore's Item Crawler has a field for each item in the index called "_path" which is a multivalued string field of IDs, so as an example, Region 1's _path field value would be [000, 111, 221 ].</p>  <p>When I write this using the Linq abstraction it comes out as below which doesn't return results.</p>  <p><code>-_path:(111) OR _path:(221)</code></p>  <p>But _path:(111) does return result. <em>Mind blown</em>.</p>  <p>When I use the Solr interface and wrap each side of the OR in extra brackets like below (which I'd consider redundant) it works! <em>Mind blown v2</em>.</p>  <p><code>(-_path:(111)) OR (_path:(221))</code></p>  <p>Firstly, what's the difference between those queries?</p>  <p>Secondly, my real problem is I can't add these extra brackets as I'm working in an abstraction Linq so the brackets will be "optimized" out. </p>  <p>Any advice would be awesome! Cheers.</p>
