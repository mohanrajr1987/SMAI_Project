<p>I have documents indexed like</p>  <pre><code>{ "content":"Lots of text and some html", "file_type": "application/pdf", "id": "path_to_file", "comp": "irrelevant fields", "_version_": 1506272321148522231 } </code></pre>  <p>I want Solr to prioritize the results that contain the queried keyword in <code>&lt;abc&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/abc&gt;</code> tags. How can this be done? I have searched a lot and din't get any relevant answer.</p>
