<p>I have content that is about 50 TB large. The number of documents in this set is about 250 million. The daily increment to this is not very large nay my be about 10000 documents of varying sizes totaling under 50 MB. The current indexing effort is taking way too long and is guesstimated to complete in 100+ days!!!<br>  So ... is this really that large of a data set? To me, 50 TB of content (in this day and age) is not very large. Do you have content of this size? If you do, how did you improve time taken for one-time indexing? Also, how did you improve time taken by real-time indexing?<br> If you can answer .. great. If you can point me in the right direct direction ... appreciate that as well.<br></p>  <p>Thanks in advance. <br>rd</p>
