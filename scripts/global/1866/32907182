<p>I have very large Solr index and would like to make it smaller, but avoid re-indexing, though index rebuilding (optimizing) is allowed.</p>  <p>First, I want to delete term vectors, as they are not needed any more. I've modified schema.xml and run an index optimization, but nothing was deleted  - the index remains its size and *.fdt file didn't change (although segment letter changed).</p>  <p>I believe that it's possible to remove unused term vectors data, cannot find the proper way</p>
