<p>I am using solr for my work and it's excellent. However I am having trouble generating more elaborate search results. </p>  <p>I am searching for products by their title, brand, gender, and category (dress shoes, jackets, etc). Brands live in a "Brands" DB table, and the same for categories and genders. Products live in a "Products" DB table which is foreign-keyed to the Brands, Categories and Genders tables.</p>  <p>I am loading all of these into solr, and I can do a weighted ranked search accross them without trouble. This will give the most similar products, weighed by certain fields. What I would like is to do next is find exact matches from each field for any search string. For example:</p>  <p>SEARCH STRING: "Michael Kors Light Green Men's Dress Shoes"</p>  <p>SHOULD MATCH:</p>  <p>Brands: </p>  <ul> <li>Michael Kors</li> </ul>  <p>Colours:</p>  <ul> <li>Light Green</li> <li>Green</li> </ul>  <p>Gender:</p>  <ul> <li>Mens</li> </ul>  <p>Category:</p>  <ul> <li>Dress Shoes </li> <li>Shoes</li> </ul>  <p>I can then do a more restrictive - but categorised - intersect search. E.g. all products that are [light green] AND [michael kors] AND [Dress Shoes OR Shoes]</p>  <p>Thanks :)</p>
