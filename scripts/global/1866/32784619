<p>I am aware that I can disable the replication from master for all slaves as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://master_host:port/solr/replication?command=disablereplication">http://master_host:port/solr/replication?command=disablereplication</a></p>  <p>However, as per my understanding, this disabling of replication is for all of the cores. Can we specify which core we do want to disable the replication for?</p>  <p>Please note that I do not want to use the replication disabling facility from slave side.</p>
