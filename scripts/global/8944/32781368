<p>Step 1: Making a REST call using HttpClient to Twitter endpoint and getting a tweet message containing an emoticon. Twitter APIs returns the string with UTF-8 encoding.<br> Example: Message = ðŸ˜„;<br> Step 2: I am using Java to read the string, using InputStreamReader, with charset <code>UTF-8</code>. Still, the string's length turns out to be 2, rather than being 1.<br> How can this be possible, when I am explicitly parsing it using <code>UTF-8</code>?<br> On net I found several resources, where its mentioned that an emoticon is a high codepoint character, and thus java considers it to be of 2 characters (surrogate pair), which doesn't makes sense.<br> Can someone help me with it?</p>
