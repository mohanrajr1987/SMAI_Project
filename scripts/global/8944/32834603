<p>I have a batch of .csv files downloaded from the web to import them to a worksheet. All the Chinese characters in the .csv files are messy code.</p>  <p>I tried the step: Data - From Text - Delimited - 65001 : Unicode (UTF-8), this does help.</p>  <p>But since there are too many .csv files to import, I am wondering if I can use VBA to import all these .csv with UTF-8 encoding?</p>
