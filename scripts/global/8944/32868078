<p>Whilst doing some checking for a client to see if their site was still functioning well I found a random page that contained a bunch of weird characters like <code>¿½</code>.</p>  <p>I think this has to do with the tables having a <code>latin1</code> encoding instead of <code>utf-8</code>. But seeing as no other pages are affected that use the same table could there be another error. I did check if the text itself was safe and making sure it was just clean text. </p>  <p>So I have 2 questions, the main one being is it safe to just update this one table to <code>utf8</code> and if not what causes this error and wondered why would this only affects one certain page. (Side note the website is built using typo3)<br> Ofcourse I have live example's the links are:<br> <a href="http://www.marktaanbodautobranche.nl/content/advertentie/detail/advertentie/bedrijf/uid/14/" rel="nofollow">Site 1: With weird text characters</a><br> <a href="http://www.marktaanbodautobranche.nl/content/advertentie/detail/advertentie/bedrijf/uid/47/" rel="nofollow">Site 2: Same table, but no weird characters</a></p>
