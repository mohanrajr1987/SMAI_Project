<p>I need to enter the text in unicode directly from the keyboard (Vietnamese for this time) but nothing happens. It once works with another simple app but I don't know what am I missing so this app won't allow unicode input.</p>  <p>I've tried </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Properties the project -> Resource -> Text file encoding -> Other -> UTF-8</p> </blockquote>  <p>or <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</code> in every xml activity or even in AndroidManifest.xml but no luck.</p>  <p>Is there anything I missed? Most of the tutorials I found are listed above.</p>  <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
