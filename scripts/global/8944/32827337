<p>I am have been having problems storing UTF-8 characters in a Firebird 2.1 DB Varchar field.</p>  <p>The field definition does not have a character set specified. The character set is always passed in the connection string.</p>  <p>The character set on all fields is set as NONE. Connection string is </p>  <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;add name="ConnectionString"    connectionString="character set=UTF8;initial catalog=&amp;quot;c:\temp\data.FDB&amp;quot;;user id=SYSDBA;password=;connection lifetime=15;pooling=true;MinPoolSize=0;MaxPoolSize=50;data source=localhost"   providerName="FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient" /&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>The .NET driver version is 2.1.0.0. Firebird itself is version 2.1.3.18185.</p>  <p>It was my understanding that this would override any setting on the field itself however I have been having trouble storing characters e.g. Right single quote (ALT + 0146) in the database. It always comes out as an strange question mark character.</p>  <p>After a few days of blaming the ASP.NET web site, I discovered that if I set the character set as UTF-8 on the field (domain) itself, then it appears to fix the problem.</p>  <p>Is this correct?</p>  <p>I always thought that passing the character set in the connection string would do the same thing.</p>
