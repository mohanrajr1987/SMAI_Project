<p>On a Windows (10) box, why can I print the 'black flag' (U+2691) character in certain places but not others (cmd.exe in particular)?</p>  <p>Update with proposed hints in comments (no answers yet): - [From Kevin] CMD.exe Unicode support is dubious (unspecified, but write off the issue I am having as strange CMD.exe behavior) - [From Mark] The process should write to the ConsoleAPI instead of stdout. - [From Mr. Lister] Change the font.</p>  <p>I changed the font in Webstorm. It was using <code>monospaced</code>, and displayed the flag properly. I switched to <code>Consolas</code>, <code>Lucida Sans</code>, and <code>Courier New</code> and it worked in all of them. I looked at <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/font/lucida_console/list.htm" rel="nofollow">the list of supported unicode chars for Lucida Console</a> and indeed, U+2691 is not on there. So Webstorm might have some fallback mechanism to support the character. </p>  <p>I ran ConEmu, and set the base font to Lucida Console, and Alternative font to DejaVu Sans, which I downloaded from <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/dejavu-sans" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I had to adjust the Unicode range manually, setting it to 2013-3000. And voila, the black flag showed. So although part one is now (kindof) solved, I still don't really know what is going on with fonts vs graphics and code pages here. I think the codepage is a red herring when dealing with some unicode... So please, if someone has anything definitive, I would love a proper answer. ;-)</p>  <p>Note, I have the cmd.exe font set to Lucida Console and Current Code Page to (UTF-8) 65001. I have also tried other fonts...and chcp 1252. And yes, I have read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html" rel="nofollow">the Spolsky post</a>, which is excellent. I think what I was missing is what Kevin said in the comment (cmd.exe does not have <em>proper</em> Unicode support) and what Mark said about bypassing stdout. This explains cmd.exe but would love to know more about VS vs VS Code vs NP++...</p>  <p>I can see the character fine in chrome:</p>  <pre><code>http://graphemica.com/⚑ http://graphemica.com/%E2%9A%91 </code></pre>  <p>I can see it fine in one of these:</p>  <ul> <li>Office (Word, Outlook)</li> <li>WebStorm</li> <li>Visual Studio</li> </ul>  <p>However, I cannot see it here (shows up as a box):</p>  <ul> <li>Notepad++</li> <li>Visual Studio Code</li> <li>cmd.exe</li> </ul>  <p>If I run this in node:</p>  <pre><code>console.log('\u2691:', '\u2691'); console.log('Flag:', '⚑') </code></pre>  <p>It just dumps boxes (which when I copy and paste in here are fine).</p>  <p>Then there are other characters like: heavy check mark (U+2714)</p>  <p><a href="http://graphemica.com/%E2%9C%94" rel="nofollow">http://graphemica.com/%E2%9C%94</a> <a href="http://graphemica.com/" rel="nofollow">http://graphemica.com/</a>✔</p>  <p>Which 'show up' in Visual Studio Code (which could not show the flag) but wont show up in cmd.exe.</p>  <p>There appear to be a lot of moving parts here: Unicode, char codes, code pages, fonts, and lots more.</p>  <p>Can someone help me sort this out? What exactly is going on here?</p>  <ol> <li><p>Why does the character display in some places and not in the other?</p></li> <li><p>Is there anything I can do to show the characters in cmd.exe?</p></li> </ol>
