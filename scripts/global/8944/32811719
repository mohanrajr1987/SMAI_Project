<p>When I try to open/view SQLite file in a sqlite db viewer application it shows me the values as Text/Numbers characters, the original values were in Arabic, but it seems like something happened or the application itself doesn't read UTF8 data.  Is there anyway to decode data back to it's original values? Does this mean that data is damaged or corrupted now because they don't show correctly anymore? Please check the attached image.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GKNrn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GKNrn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
