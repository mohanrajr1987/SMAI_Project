<p>Trying to quickly convert a latin1 mysql DB to utf8, I tried the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Dump the DB</li> <li>run iconv -f latin1 -t utf8 on the resulting file</li> <li>import into a fresh DB with UTF8 default encoding</li> </ol>  <p>This <em>mostly</em> works except... <strong>some letters</strong> get converted wrong (an example: uppercase accented 'U' becomes some garbled sequence starting with a question mark). Some conversion is taking place (od an a query result shows a two byte sequence where the latin1 byte was) and te latin1 version is alright. While I have so far been unsystematic in isolating the problem (late night; under deadline; etc.) the weirdness of the issue kills me: why would it fail on <strong>some</strong> letters and not all? Client connection? Column charset? Why I am not getting any diagnostics? I'm stymied.</p>  <p>Sure, I can work on isolating the issue and its details, but thought that maybe somebody ran into this already and can recognize it by this (admittedly rather poor) description.</p>  <p>Cheers </p>
