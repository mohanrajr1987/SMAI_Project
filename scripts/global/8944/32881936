<p>I need to programatically open outlook 2016 on users computer, with new message, which contains the predefined fields (To, Bcc, UTF-8 body, attachment). For that, I need to generate either a file which outlook opens as a new message, or a script which makes outlook open the new message.</p>  <p>It may look like an easy task, but it is actually tricky. I would, for example, do it in a way that I generate an .eml file, with content like this:</p>  <pre><code>From: info@m.net To: to@m.net Cc: cc@m.net Bcc: bcc@m.net X-Unsent: 1 Subject: Something  This is a test message. Multipart can be used to add attachment. </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that this won't work, because if such file is opened by outlook (as .eml file), outlook is able to open it, but it ignores Bcc line entirely.</p>  <p>So in another iteration, I would try to make a VBS script instead:</p>  <pre><code>Set objoutlookApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")  Set objmessage = objoutlookApp.CreateItem(olMailItem)  objmessage.TO = "mail1@domain.com;mail2@example.de" objmessage.CC = "cc1@x.com;cc2@y.de" objmessage.BCC = "bcc@domain.com" objmessage.Subject = "E-Mail Subject" objmessage.Body = "Here comes some text" objmessage.display set objmessage = Nothing set objoutlookApp = Nothing wscript.quit </code></pre>  <p>This seems a bit better, but is still insufficient. First of all, the VBS file cannot be in UTF-8 format, thus it's not possible to send an email in chinese, for example, I need to be able to write UTF-8 encoded string directly to the body since it needs to be a single-file solution. And second, I have no idea how to add atachments (multipart) this way.</p>  <p>Is there any way to open new message window in outlook with predefined fields (including Bcc), by a file which I can generate server side and then send to the user to open?</p>
