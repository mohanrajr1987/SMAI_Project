<p>I'm trying to use some python module but it gives me the following error: </p>  <pre><code>  UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa9 in position 1 </code></pre>  <p>I think it's because my input file contains non UTF-8 characters inside, so I want to cleanse the file before I pass it to the module.</p>  <p>If I want to identify non UTF-8 characters and delete them, how would I do it?? I tried googling for it, but couldn't find good answers. </p>
