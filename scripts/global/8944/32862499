<p>I have some piece of software which generates a text-only SQLite3 DB, another one which performs some operations on said DB and in the end there is a PHP interface I use for a demo (and so it will be removed as soon as the demo ends) which performs some <code>SELECT</code>s and shows part of the data. </p>  <p>Everything is ok and working until the PHP connects to the DB (I double-checked at every step), at which point the charset encoding is messed up in the DB, not only in the visualization. Both PHP and the DB use utf-8 as the charset and I've tried to connect to the DB using the <code>SQLITE3_OPEN_READONLY</code> flag but nevertheless when I open the DB I find the charset messed up. Am I missing some parameter in PHP? Please note that the PHP code is only part of a demo and will not be released with the software, so I can change anything in the PHP but nothing in the previous steps.</p>
