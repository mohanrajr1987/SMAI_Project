<p>In this question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4059775/convert-iso-8859-1-strings-to-utf-8-in-c-c">Convert ISO-8859-1 strings to UTF-8 in C/C++</a></p>  <p>There is a really nice concise piece of c++ code that converts ISO-8859-1 strings to UTF-8. </p>  <p>In this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4059934/3426514">http://stackoverflow.com/a/4059934/3426514</a></p>  <p>I'm still a beginner at c++ and I'm struggling to understand how this works. I have read up on the encoding sequences of UTF-8, and I understand that &lt;128 the chars are the same, and above 128 the first byte gets a prefix and the rest of the bits are spread over a couple of bytes starting with 10xx, but I see no bit shifting in this answer.</p>  <p>If someone could help me to decompose it into a function that only processes 1 character, it would really help me understand.</p>
