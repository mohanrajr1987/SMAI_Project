<p>This question is might not be very clear, but I want to give it my best shot. </p>  <p>I want to create a web app, where selected users can input information (like address, phone number, etc.) and another group of users can access that information. For now, lets assume that I don't need any passport or account registration. </p>  <p>How do I begin building the app? Is there an open source version of something similar I can modify?</p>
