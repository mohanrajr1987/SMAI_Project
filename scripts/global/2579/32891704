<p>I'm using Visual Studio 2012, I have a problem creating and consuming a web service.  I can't provide the URL because it is on a VPN.</p>  <p>First I try from a service reference, the problem is all methods return null and receive null.  </p>  <p>Then I try from web service and get:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There was an error reflecting<br>   Method can not be reflected.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can't access to web service from Url, but I can from SOAPGui.</p>  <p>Any idea why?  Any solution?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
