<p>I have the following simple setup in Azure ML. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kWi0S.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kWi0S.jpg" alt="ML setup"></a>  Basically the Reader is a SQL query to a DB which returns a vector called Pdelta, which is then passed to the R script for further processing  and the results are then returned back to the web service. The DB query is simple (<code>SELECT Pdelta FROM ...</code>) and it works fine. I have set the DB query as a web service paramater as well. </p>  <p>Everything seems to work fine, but at the end when i publish it as a web service and test it, it somehow asks for an additional input parameter. The additional parameter gets called <code>PDELTA</code>. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mnzPZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mnzPZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I am wondering why is this happening, what is it that I am overlooking? I would like to make this web service ask for only one parameter - the SQL query (Delta Query) which would then deliver the Pdeltas. </p>  <p>Any ideas or suggestions would be grealty appreciated! </p>
