<p>I'm currently on a project that involves OpenText Content Server 10.5 SP1 Update 2015-03.</p>  <p>I'm trying to find out if is possible to get all categories from the System Category Volume with one call using Java SOAP web services or REST.</p>  <p>On the web services side I found a couple of methods exposed by the DocumentManagement WSDL <code>GetCategoryDefinition</code> and <code>GetCategoryDefinitions</code> which require categoryIDs as argument.</p>  <p>On the REST side I managed to obtain access to categories but after a quite long trip:</p>  <ol> <li>call to <code>otcs/cs.exe?func=search.GetCategoryVolume</code> gives as a response an URL for the subsequent call</li> <li>call to <code>otcs/cs.exe?func=ll&amp;ObjID=2005&amp;objAction=XMLExport&amp;scope=1</code> gives the id of the system category volume along with category IDs</li> <li>call to <code>otcs/cs.exe?func=ll&amp;ObjID=21361&amp;objAction=XMLExport&amp;scope=1</code> gives the required info about the category.</li> </ol>  <p>I would like to have a single call returning all information about categories I need.</p>  <p>Is it possible to achieve that?</p>
