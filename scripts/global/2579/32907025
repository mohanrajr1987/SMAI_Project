<p>I've worked on a webservice using Java's JAX-WS and Apache's CXF. Deploying was done with Tomcat 8. So my problem is like this, my webservice class contains some code that initializes certain things for my service and I want that done ASAP, so I've set that up in a nice method annotated with @PostConstruct. I also have a @Resource WebServiceContext.</p>  <p>So the problem is as following. I have a method retrieving properties, getting them from the webservice's MessageContext. The problem is that at the time @PostConstruct kicks in, the MessageContext is still null, which obviously leads to a NullPointerException.</p>  <p>As a temporary solution I have every method exposed by the WS calling my init method if it still wasn't called by anyone else. Not that pleasant. Any tips for working around this? </p>
