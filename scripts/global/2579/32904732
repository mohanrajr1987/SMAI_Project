<p>I am trying to call SOAP web service from watchOS 2 natively. I have read to apple document on WatchOS 2 and found that it can be possible with NSURLSession but documents are not very useful to find how? I have found some good help in swift but not for Objective c.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me to writing Objective c code for calling SOAP Web Service with basic apache authentication directly form WatchOS 2 using NSURLSession and read response. Is there any good API available to call SOAP Wen service which can be used with WatchOS 2 natively.</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance! </p>
