<p>I'm writing an application helping people in learning english. Now I'm trying to find a restful web service which returns useful information about english words like example sentences, spelling suggestions, phrases containing a given word, etc. Actually seems I found a good one - <a href="http://developer.wordnik.com/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.wordnik.com/</a>. Unfortunately it does not return images for appropriate english words. Such images help to memorize new words. Maybe somebody knows a web service which has such feature implemented?</p>
