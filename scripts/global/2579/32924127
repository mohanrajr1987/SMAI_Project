<p>As in question I need to differentiate in JAXB code on the server side when in SOAP message optional enum field is not present and when optional enum field is present, but with wrong value. The problem is that JAXB returns them both as null and I don't know how to distingush them.</p>  <p>Axis does unmarshalling in my web service so for now I don't know where and what should I do to eventually modify unmarshalling process, but I am searching.</p>
