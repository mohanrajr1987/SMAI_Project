<p>I'm trying to write a test (karma/mocha/chai using PhantomJS) for an iframe component we have. The component adds an iframe to the page, and resolves a promise when the iframe's <code>onload</code> event fires.</p>  <pre><code>$('iframe').on('load', function() {    promise.resolve(); }); </code></pre>  <p>It works fine in-browser, but the event never seems to fire when using inside PhantomJS.</p>  <p>I tested using an invalid the <code>src</code> and phantom threw a 404 error so I know it's loading something. </p>  <p>Is there any known issue with PhantomJS + onload? I can't find anything.</p>  <p>Is there any way to better debug this?</p>
