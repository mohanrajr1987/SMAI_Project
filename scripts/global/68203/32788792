<p>Is there a way to make PhantomJS respect the viewport meta tag? If not, is there any way to write a selenium test for a browser that respects the said tag? I'd like to do some automated testing for mobile browsers.</p>  <p>Details: I find that PhantomJS does not respect viewport meta tag. I am using PhantomJS with selenium. To set PhantomJS's viewport size, I use <code>driver.manage.window.setSize( new Dimension( 320, 800 ) )</code>. My meta tag looks like: <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=800"&gt;</code> I would assume that if a browser respects the meta tag, it would render my website at 800px, as is true for mobile browsers I tested this with. However, PhantomJS doesn't do this. So is there a way to force this?</p>
