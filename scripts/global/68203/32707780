<p>I am trying to test my React component and getting the following error.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Invariant Violation: Could not find "store" in either the context or props of "Connect()". Either wrap the root component in a &lt;Provider>, or explicitly pass "store" as a prop to "Connect()".</p> </blockquote>  <p>The error comes while rendering the Component in the test.</p>  <pre><code>beforeEach(() =&gt; {   Component = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(&lt;SideMenu /&gt;); }); </code></pre>  <p>It works fine when rendering the Component on the page. However in test, I am not able to pass the store explicitly into the Component.</p>  <p>Can someone point in the right direction?</p>
