<p>Rendering a table, with boarders, to PDF using phantomjs leaves each individual cell bordered but with a gap between each cell. The table is displayed correctly, without such gaps, on a web page.</p>  <p>in my CSS I've tried setting:</p>  <pre><code>border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px 0px; </code></pre>  <p>to no avail, I need to get rid of those gaps between cells in my PDF. Any ideas would be gratefully received. Yours Allan</p>
