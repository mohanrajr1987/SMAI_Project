<p>I know it may sound crazy but yeah, I thought making angular work on old IEs was crazy enough. The reason why is that our app are running fine on most browsers (laptop and fone). Now it is not working with prerenderio (which depends on phantomjs). </p>  <p>Note: not the whole app having the problem but just a few routes.  I tried to comment our the code of that route but it still giving $rootScope/infdig. </p>  <p>I have been debuging it for 2 days before asking. I really need some hint what to do</p>
