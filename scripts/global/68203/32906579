<p>I've created a webpage that makes a screenshot of another webpage, and saves that locally on the server. <strong><a href="http://phantomjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Phantomjs</a></strong> is used to create the screenshot, and <strong><a href="https://github.com/microweber/screen" rel="nofollow">screen-master</a></strong> is used to save it locally on the server. </p>  <p>On my Ubuntu desktop machine this works. On our Amazon Linux server (Centos like) it doesn't. </p>  <ul> <li>When I open the page in my browser it stays totally blank and no image is created on the server. </li> <li>When I call phantomjs from the server command line to create a test image using a javascript test file, it works. </li> <li>In the apache logs I see no errors. </li> <li>The cache and jobs folders (where the image is saved) in screen-master are set to 777. </li> <li>The PhantomJS file is set to execute. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>How can I get PhantomJS working using Screen-Master?</strong></p>
