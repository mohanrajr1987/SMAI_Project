<p>In CasperJS, I want to act on JSON data from an AJAX response.  What I'm currently doing is calling <code>casper.download()</code> to write the response to a file, then reading the file back in and parsing it as JSON, something along these lines:</p>  <pre><code>casper.then(function() {   url = build_url();   tmp_target = create_tmp_target_name();   casper.download(url, tmp_target, 'GET');  // write JSON to tmp_target    var fs = require('fs');   var str = fs.read(tmp_target);   var json = JSON.parse(str);   fs.remove(tmp_target); </code></pre>  <p>But this seems really heavy-handed.  Is there a better way to capture an AJAX / JSON response?</p>
