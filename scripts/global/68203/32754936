For firefox driver sendkeys is working for me but for phantomjs sendkeys doesn't work for me.</p>  <pre><code> // Works for FirefoxDriver  // Doesn't work for PhantomjsDriver  IWebElement UploadResourceBrowseButton = driver.FindElement(By.Id("files"));  UploadResourceBrowseButton.SendKeys("C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\Sample Pictures\\Desert.jpg"); </code></pre>  <p>Tried another solution for Phantomjs but doesn't work</p>  <pre><code> // Tried this as well but doesn't work  ((PhantomJSDriver)driver).ExecutePhantomJS("var page = this; page.uploadFile('input[type=file]', 'C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\Sample Pictures\\Desert.jpg');"); </code></pre>
