<p>I used xamdatagrid cellupdated event,inside that event i have to disable the specific cell in editing and want to enable it after getting the response of an API call,the problem is when i enable the cell after disabling it,the cursor wont set in the correct position.</p>  <pre><code>private async void RenewDataGrid_OnCellUpdated(object sender, CellUpdatedEventArgs e) {     row.Cells[4].IsEnabled = false;     await datacontext.CalculateFdtotalAmount();     row.Cells[4].IsEnabled = true; } </code></pre>
