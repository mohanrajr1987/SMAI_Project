<p>Based from a video from Brian Lagunas (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfBy2nfykqY" rel="nofollow">YouTube Link</a>) I started using Prism 6. I am a little bit confused, where the constructor of the MainWindowViewModel is getting called. I nearly copied his project and can't find the part. If i set a break point in the constructor, it never gets there.</p>  <p>Was he no showing something in the video or something?</p>
