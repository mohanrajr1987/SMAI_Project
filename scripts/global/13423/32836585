<p>I am currently writing a WPF application which has a navigation panel on its left side (to which I bind a navigationViewModel) and a content presenter on its right side (which I bind to the previously mentioned VM's UserControl member 'CurrentView'. For each item of this navigation panel, I created a corresponding user control and for each of these user controls, I bind an instance of a corresponding ViewModel.</p>  <p>Clicking on a navigation panel's items sets its ViewModel's UserControl member CurrentView to the instance of the corresponding UC, which is then displayed in the content presenter mentioned above.</p>  <p>The first navigation item is some "select or create a new client" form. When this operation is done, I would like to set some wide app resource id to which I would bind the other navigation items Enabled state. Thus, if the wide app resource is null, they are disabled, as soon as it is set to anything, they are enabled. There would also be some mechanism which would allow the corresponding ViewModel to be notified of this situation.</p>  <p>I am wondering if this would be considered a good practice?  Furthermore, I'd like to know if I can simply declare an int resource in the app.xaml and bind it to the navigation items Enabled property, would setting this resource to anything immediately refresh this property? Or is there a better, simpler or cleaner way?</p>
