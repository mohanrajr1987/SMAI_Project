<p>we tried to validate/verify email id (somename@aol.com) via SMTP. By using MX records of email domain,  connects to the domain's SMTP server and verify whether the email address really exist or not. Its working perfectly with free domains like gmail, hotmail and other paid domains. In AOL, while connecting through SMTP server, service unavailable error occurs.</p>  <pre><code>   MX records (aol.com)    [mailin-02.mx.aol.com]    [mailin-04.mx.aol.com]    [mailin-03.mx.aol.com]    [mailin-01.mx.aol.com]    [aol.com]     Connecting to mailin-02.mx.aol.com:25    Connected to mailin-02.mx.aol.com:25 successfully    &lt;&lt;&lt;recv: 421 mtaig-mcd04.mx.aol.com Service unavailable - try again later    Unexpected response after connecting: 421 mtaig-mcd04.mx.aol.com Service unavailable - try again later    Closing socket to mailin-02.mx.aol.com:25 </code></pre>  <p>Other Host errors</p>  <pre><code>   421 mtaig-aah03.mx.aol.com Service unavailable - try again later    421 mtaig-aab04.mx.aol.com Service unavailable - try again later    421 mtaig-mce02.mx.aol.com Service unavailable - try again later    421 mtaig-aad02.mx.aol.com Service unavailable - try again later </code></pre>  <p>My IP is not in spamhaus list or any blocklist. I tried to know my domain health and figure out bugs/issues with my IP using mxtoolbox.com. My domain health seems good with PTR, SPF, etc..</p>  <p>I tried AOL API to check whether AOL email ID exist -</p>  <pre><code> https://i.aol.com/reg/username post content : accountType=newEmail  &amp; locale=en_US &amp; promo=825329 &amp; userName=someNameToBeValidated &amp; v=-32976413829120261. It moves to err 420. </code></pre>  <ul> <li>Then what will be the issue in connecting and validating AOL email address ?</li> <li>Is there any other alternate to validate AOL email address by using SMTP or any API(Paid &amp; Free)? </li> <li>Is there any official premium paid service available with AOL ? </li> <li>Is there any api available for developer.aol.com ?</li> </ul>
