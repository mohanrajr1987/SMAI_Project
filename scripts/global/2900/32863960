<p>I have started a new domain for a client, and made sure everything works well, however it still has to resolve. ( I was Setting nameservers from clients server to our own). </p>  <p>But the client already wanted to send e-mails. So I have made him a few using DirectAdmin. Although they don't work yet and I get the standard 550 error. And so I was thinking this probably has something to do with either the domain or mail not being resolved yet.</p>  <p>So I was wondering what the standard resolve time is for mailboxes or does this entirly depend on the domain-name resolve time? I could not find anything via the DA documentation. Any tips or help would be greatly appriciated. </p>
