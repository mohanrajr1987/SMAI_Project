<p>I have installed sendmail on my webserver and have been using it for internal email alert type actions, using the <code>mail()</code> php function and more recently, <code>PHPMailer</code>.</p>  <p>So far so good.</p>  <p>It does deliver the email when I send, but it will only deliver to my internal domain (i.e. @mybusiness.com).</p>  <p>In some cases I need to send alerts to clients with emails on other domains (gmail, hotmail or whatever) however they are not received when I send them.</p>  <p>When I do send the email to a domain outside of my own, I get the following bounce error:</p>  <pre><code>The original message was received at Wed, 30 Sep 2015 20:58:39 -0400 from localhost [127.0.0.1]     ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors ----- &lt;joe.blow@gmail.com&gt;     (reason: 550 Host unknown)     ----- Transcript of session follows ----- 550 5.1.2 &lt;joe.blow@gmail.com&gt;... Host unknown (Name server: gmail.com: host not found) </code></pre>  <p>It bounces from an internal "mailer-daemon" address. Meaning it doesn't actually exit out of my internal servers.</p>  <p>The script that is sending it looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>$email = new PHPMailer(); $email-&gt;Host         = 'mybusiness.com'; $email-&gt;ReturnPath     = 'steven@mybusiness.com'; $email-&gt;Sender         = 'steven@mybusiness.com'; $email-&gt;From          = 'steven@mybusiness.com'; $email-&gt;FromName      = 'Your Consultant'; $email-&gt;addReplyTo     = 'steven@mybusiness.com'; $email-&gt;Subject       = 'Test Email'; $email-&gt;Body          = 'Hello Joe'; $email-&gt;AltBody     = 'Hello Joe'; $email-&gt;AddAddress('joe.blow@gmail.com'); $email-&gt;isHTML(true); $email-&gt;Send(); </code></pre>  <p>I am honestly not tracking with the proper configuration of sendmail. All I know is that it works when sending to my own domain for my company.</p>  <p>If anybody can point me in the right direction of what needs to be configured, etc. that would be helpful.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
