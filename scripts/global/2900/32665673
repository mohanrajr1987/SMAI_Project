<p>I've seen similar Questions BUT my case is: The direct emails sent from the account aren't filtered while the mail sent through SMTP are collected as SPAM.</p>  <p>I purchased Email Services for my Company (support@website.com) and whenn I send emails through this email to my customers, they get marked as spam. This happens when I send emails via ASP.NET's SMTP service:</p>  <pre><code>   MailMessage mm = new MailMessage("support@website.com", email);    mm.Subject = "Welcome, " + name;    string body = "Hello " + name + ",";    mm.Body = body;    mm.IsBodyHtml = true;    mm.BodyEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding("utf-8");    SmtpClient smtp = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com", 587);    smtp.Credentials = new System.Net.NetworkCredential("support@website.com", "MY_PASS");    smtp.EnableSsl = true;    smtp.Send(mm); </code></pre>  <p>When I <strong>directly send the emails, they don't get filtered</strong>. There's something missing in the code I assume?</p>
