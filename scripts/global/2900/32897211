<p>I'm trying to send the mail to the store (Node), on the onsucess event of createOrder api.</p>  <p>So for this, I've created 2 new services.</p>  <p>The first service receives the information from the onsucess event of the createOrder api and passes it on to the queue.</p>  <p>The second service receives the information from that queue and passes it on to the email server.</p>  <p>This sends the email. The problem is that for some of the orders the email is not sending, but we are not getting any exceptions for these.</p>  <p>In the logs for those orders it shows the "Successful Acknowledgement from the email server".</p>  <p>I don't know where the exact problem is. I have checked the email server, but cannot find anything related to the missing order information.</p>  <p>What steps can I take to further debug this problem?</p>
