<p>I'd like to get the SMTP header of the selected email in outlook.</p>  <p>I looked all over the API, but I can't find how to do this using the Office API : <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp142185.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp142185.aspx</a></p>  <p>I also tried looking what's available in the Message object (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp161175.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp161175.aspx</a>) :</p>  <p><code>Office.context.mailbox.item.?</code></p>  <p>I'm wondering if I should not use an Exchange Web Services (EWS) to do this ?</p>  <p>I'm asking because I have no idea if it is doable. I just tried to show you the process I've been through so far.</p>
