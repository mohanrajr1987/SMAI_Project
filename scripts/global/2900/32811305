<p>I need some assistance with these type of scanners, there seem to be many of them on the web but I can't seem to find specific details of what they are meant to achieve.</p>  <p>I understand that they are communicating on the SMTP port, but I am not certain of what type of information they are trying to get.</p>  <p>The reason I ask this is because I am currently investigating a SMTP VRFY Scanner. I have made the scanner to connect to a windows xp system but it states </p>  <pre><code>Waiting for SMTP banner 220 testing221 Microsoft ESMTP MAIL Service, Version: 6.0.2600.2180 ready at  Sun, 27 Sep 2015 19:04:44 +0100  </code></pre>  <p><code>testing221</code> corresponds to the domain on the SMTP virtual server, on the xp system.</p>
