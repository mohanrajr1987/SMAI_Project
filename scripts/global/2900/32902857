<p>I am used to using email for working purpose, and I use gmail-SMTP.<br> I use this method in my web applications to make the users receive any notifications. There's no problem in sending the emails. But, I don't have any 'Sent Mail' exists in the gmail dashboard of the account I use.<br> Does someone know where are the sent emails archived? Does gmail save/archive the sent mails?<br> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PRaLf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PRaLf.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
