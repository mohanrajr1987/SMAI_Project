<p>we are using phpmailer to send our emails over smtp. Never really had a problem until today.  Our site sends out a lot of emails, but today 3 of them failed due to authentication. I'm trying to figure out why. On phpmailer's <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting#authentication-failures" rel="nofollow">github troubleshooting</a> page it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If your authentication is failing, there are several likely causes:</p>      <ol>   <li>You have the wrong username or password </li>   <li>Your connection is being diverted to a different server (as above) </li>   <li>You have specified authentication without encryption</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>I know it's not 1 or 3 because I've tested the mailer since then and everything seems to be working. So I'm thinking number 2 might be the reason but I'm not quite sure what it means or why it would be diverted. Can anyone elaborate on this?</p>
