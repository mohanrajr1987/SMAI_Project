<p>I am using the SWT integration of Office to work with office document, my problem is when saving the changes of the file. I am using this code :</p>  <pre><code>FileDialog dialog = new FileDialog(getShell(), SWT.SAVE);         String path = dialog.open();         if (path != null) {           if (clientSite.save(new File(path), false)) {             System.out.println("Saved to file successfully.");           } else {             System.err.println("Failed to save to file");           }         }       } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that the save function is returning false no matter what file do I provide. this means file is not saved. Can any one assist. Kind regards</p>
