<p>I have a Java Eclipse RCP program in which I have a a long string inside a JFace combobox. Now when I am in the same view,The combobox attaches a scroll over it to show the full name. but as soon as I re size the window of the application, the combobox stretches itself to accommodate the lengthy string. </p>  <p>How do i make the combobox stay the same size. Like the size of it should remain fixed even after I resize the window. Here are two screen shots to demonstrate the issue. </p>  <p>P.S. I am using a comboViewer and inside it a comboBox.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kePZM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kePZM.png" alt="desired behaviour"></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zD6Q6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zD6Q6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
