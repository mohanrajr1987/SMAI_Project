<p>This isn't necessarily 'essential' for what I'm doing, but it would help to make the application look nicer.</p>  <p>I was wondering if it were possible to (instead of closing the window and opening a new one) pan from the current content in the window to the new content, preferably in any direction (up, down, left, right) of choice. If so, some code examples or a link pointing me in the right direction would be nice.</p>  <h2>What I mean by 'pan'</h2>  <p>When triggered, the current <code>Control</code>s within the <code>Shell</code> gets moved out of view/off-frame, and new <code>Control</code>s come in from the opposite side, similar to panning a camera.</p>
