<p>I am using an swt dialog in which the controls get cut off from the screen if I increase the font size(Control Panel-> Display) from smaller(100%) to large(150%) This can be solved using </p>  <ol> <li>Scrollable composite or </li> <li>To resize the controls or font size if the windows size has been changed to larger.</li> </ol>  <p>For point 2, I am unable to get the current Windows size. If I get that, the problem can be solved as the scrollable composite isn't suitable for the smaller size.</p>
