<p>I am making a GUI where the output is printed to a list.</p>  <p>To do this, I extend the <code>OutputStream</code> class.</p>  <pre><code>import java.io.IOException; import java.io.OutputStream; import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.List;  /** //This class extends from OutputStream to redirect output to a SWT List widget **/ public class CustomOutputStream extends OutputStream {      private List list;      public CustomOutputStream(List list) {         this.list = list;     }      @Override     public void write(int b) throws IOException {                // redirects data to the list         list.add(String.valueOf((char)b));         // scrolls the text area to the end of data         list.select(list.getItemCount() - 1);         list.showSelection();         list.deselectAll();     } } </code></pre>  <p>In the <code>main</code> class, the list is created and passed to an instance of <code>CustomOutputStream</code>.  A print stream is created, using the <code>CustomOutputStream</code> as an argument.  The <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code> are set to use this print stream.  </p>  <pre><code>Public List list = new List(shell, SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.BORDER); Public CustomOutputStream log = new CustomOutputStream(list); PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(log); System.setOut(ps); System.setErr(ps); </code></pre>  <p>Data is printed to the list in the GUI, but there is one character per line! (Each list item is one character).  Additionally, data is not printed to the list as it is generated like it would to the console, it is "dumped" all at once to the list once the program finishes running.  How do I fix these problems?</p>
