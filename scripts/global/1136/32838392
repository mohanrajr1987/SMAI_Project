<p>We are planning to use one of the chart libraries for our Eclipse Application. jzy3d is one of them that seems pretty useful. However, there is no information, whether it could be used with our data providing solutions like GEF for plotting. </p>  <p>Does anyone have an idea about it? Or simply any other suggestion?</p>
