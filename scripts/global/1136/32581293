<p>I have to integrate MS Word into a Java SWT application. Doing that using OLEFrame and OleControlSite works but has some painting issues. The MS Word in the OLEFrame draws a thick gray border around the document (Word doesn't draw that border, if the document is opened "normally" - without OLE)</p>  <p>I've made a screenshot and marked some of the problems with a red frame:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ij796.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ij796.png" alt="Word OLE painting issues"></a></p>  <ul> <li>parts of the gray border are sometimes missing</li> <li>parts of the border have black lines (which appear, when the view is resized).</li> <li>sometimes parts of the border have a different color</li> </ul>  <p>Used software:</p>  <ul> <li>Java 1.8.0_40</li> <li>SWT: org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64-3.102.1.jar</li> <li>Word: Microsoft Office 2013</li> </ul>  <p>Any ideas how to get rid of this border (which seems to occur with OLE only) or how to fix the painting issues?</p>
