<p>I tried the two sets of example code in </p>  <p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-Understanding-Layouts/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-Understanding-Layouts/index.html</a></p>  <p>that uses first GridLayout and then FormLayout to display the "dog show entry"   window. I put each one into a Part in parallel Part Sash Containers.  When I shrink the window to resize it, the GridLayout implementation preserves the location of widgets and they become no longer visible as the window shrinks -  which intuitively seems right -   whereas the FormLayout implementation seemingly renders some widgets overlapping others to "fit" them into the smaller window space. </p>  <p>I noticed the same effect in another FormLayout part that I tried.    </p>
