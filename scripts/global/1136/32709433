<p>I have one RCP based application which creates SWT shell and windows to show some real time information. When we use that application in XenDesktop Citrix Mode, I don't get to know if my SWT shell is covered by some other application launched on that XenDesktop like notepad. I want to get some events when some other application is obscuring my SWT windows and when that application is completely moved out of my SWT window basically Z ordering events for windows. So that I can decide to show/hide my real time information accordingly.</p>
