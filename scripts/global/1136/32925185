<p>I have a dialog and when the user clicks the ok button in the dialog, the call goes from client to the server and then starts processing. In mean time when it is in the processing stage when the user tries to click anywhere on the dialog it is getting hanged and then once the process gets complete it behaves normally. So until the process gets complete i dont want the user to click the dialog, even though if he clicks the event should not be detected and dialog should not get hanged.</p>  <p>I dont want use progress monitor, is there anyway to handle this?</p>
