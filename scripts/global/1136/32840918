<p>I have a Text which will display different data of different length. Initially I was using a Textbox of fixed length. But, obviously It was not working. Then, I tried to get the length of the text, using that length as a width of the Text , like this -</p>  <pre><code>textName = new Text(composite, SWT.BORDER); String myText = tree.getSelection()[0].getText(); int length = myText.length(); textName.setBounds(76, 28, length, 21); textName.setText(myText); </code></pre>  <p>But, I found that the length of a string and the width of the Text field in SWT, are quite different. So, is there any solution for this purpose? Obviously, I can set a higher value to the width.. But, I think, that will not be a good solution.</p>
