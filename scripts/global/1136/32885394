<p>I have a TreeView with some items, with a popup menu attached.</p>  <p>The menu is implemented by extending <code>org.eclipse.jface.action.Action</code> menu should open editpart.  </p>  <pre><code>class MenuItemAction extends Action implements ISelectionListener,IWorkbenchAction{       ...      public MenuItemAction (IWorkbenchWindow window){        workbenchWindow = window;        workbenchWindow .getSelectionService().addSelectionListener(this);      }       public void run() {        ...        IWorkbenchPage page = workbenchWindow.getActivePage();        page.openEditor(...)        ...      }       public void selectionChanged(IWorkbenchPart part, ISelection selection) {         ...      }  } </code></pre>  <p>My problem is as following:  </p>  <p>When user clicks on menu items (without clicking on a popup), <code>selectionChanged</code> event is fired accordingly, but when he clicks on popup and editor is opened, then, when he tries to click on tree menu items, <code>selectionChanged</code>  event is not triggered anymore.</p>  <p>The workaround is to move focus from treeview to some other part and then click on treeview again. </p>
