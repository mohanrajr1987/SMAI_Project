<p>I am working on a GUI application with Java and SWT.<br/>I have createad a main window with a canvas in which I load an image (well it's a PDF page converted to image).<br/>I have attached a PaintListener to the canvas and when i drag the mouse onte the canvas I am able to draw a rectangle.<br/> When i release the left button on mouse, I want a dialog window to came out to "fine setting" the rectangle area, so I made a dialog with 4 spinner (x, y, width and height).<br/> Now I want to click on the spinners and the canvas redraw the changed rectangle area.<br/>I tried to pass the canvas object to the dialog window and attach a second paint listener to it (So I have one paintlistener from MainWindow.java and another from Dialog.java), but it's no working.<br/> The problem is that I have multiple rectangle drawn on the canvas, and if I call canvas.redraw() from dialog window, the rectangles already drawn on canvas "disappeared".<br/><br/>What is the best practise in such situation?<br/> I thinks to put the dialog window "in the toolbar", that is put the 4 spinners in the toolbar (or another area in the main window) so I have only one paint listener and get rid of the dialog, but I prefer the dialog 'cause it is impratical to drag a rectangle onto canvas and then move the mouse to click on toolbar.<br/><br/> Thanks in advance, Mauro</p>
