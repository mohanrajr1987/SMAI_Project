<p>I'm having some issues regarding the textlength in my swt Table. I'd like to check the length of the text when its entered and stop the user from being able to commit anymore, when the max number of letters is reached.</p>  <p>I'm not sure if I should do this in the verifyText method or if there is some other way. Hope you guys can give me a hint on how to handle this.</p>  <pre><code>@Override public void verifyText(VerifyEvent e) {      if (/*checktextlength*/) {         e.doit = true;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
