<p>My question is simple: I have a swt combo and I must do some things if the combo was selected for first time, and do other things if it was selected other times than first. Sorry but I´m newbie and I don´t know how to do that. The listener is in inner class:</p>  <pre><code>combo_agrupacion1.addSelectionListener(new GroupListener());      class GroupListener extends SelectionAdapter {          @Override         public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent evento) { } } </code></pre>
