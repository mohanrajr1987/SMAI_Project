<p>I understand what causes misalignment issues on disks, which is in short two causes:</p>  <ol> <li>Block size is not a whole multiple of one another</li> <li>The starting offset is not synched</li> </ol>  <p>But I haven't found anywhere why there is a starting offset. So why do we need it? What are it's use cases? Why not use the whole disk? What's, if any, in it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
