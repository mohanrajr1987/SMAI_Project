<p>I want to print a Jtable with the print()-method. But there is a Problem. When i print out my JTable, the table is in the Center. But i want the table to be left-aligned. I'm not talking about the alignment of the Content inside my table, I am talking about the table as a whole.</p>  <p>On my print/pdf/Piece of paper  my JTable should be "docked" on the left Corner. But how do i do that?</p>
