<p>My question is a bit like this one: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29572539/css-alight-left-and-right-within-the-same-line-without-floats">CSS: alight left and right within the same line (without floats)</a><br> The difference is that i have 3 elements in a row (date, title, author) and I want the author to be aligned right.</p>  <p>Here's a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/dtqkm2sk/2/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a> with a part of the solution. The problem is, that in my fiddle the author is positioned absolutely, so while making the window smaller you'll see that at some point the title will overlap the author.</p>  <pre><code>.e-author {     position: absolute;     right: 0; } </code></pre>  <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Can I align one of three elements at the very right without floats and / or additional html elements?</p>
