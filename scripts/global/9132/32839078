<p>I have this problem in my Bioinformatics course that I cannot seem to be able to solve because I struggle with R's syntax.</p>  <p>The next part of the exercise is to find duplicated regions on the second yeast chromosome. Perform the following steps:</p>  <ol> <li>Load the yeast genome.</li> <li>Get the second chromosome.</li> <li>Loop through windows of 500 nucleotides on the second chromosome and calculate for each window the frequencies of tetra-nucletides.</li> <li>Calculate the correlations between the frequencies of tetra-nucletides between all pairs of windows using the function cor.</li> <li>Determine pairs of windows with correlation > 0.8 using the function which with option arr.ind = T.</li> <li>Plot indices of pairs of windows with correlation > 0.8, i.e. create a scatter plot of the first column of the matrix created in 5 against its second column.</li> <li>Modify the plot created in 6 to zoom into the interesting area, i.e. adjust xlim and ylim (should cover a range from about 420 to 550).</li> <li>Interpret the plot created in 7. What biological process created the pattern?</li> <li>Align the regions that seem to be duplicated according to the plot created in 7 using the function pairwiseAlignment.</li> <li>Determine width, number of mismatches and number of indels of the pairwise alignment.</li> </ol>  <p>Looping through windows of 500 nucleotides just seems to take forever, and pairwise comparisons are taking too much time no matter what I try to do. I'm sure there is an easy way to solve this, I just can't seem to figure it out.</p>
