<p>I want to align images like shown in the Aligned Images link at the bottom of the website. I just mean that I want to place many movies dvd covers on the bottom of the page so it becomes easy to access any movies directly. So if someone hover the movie Blast than it will pop up. Can anyone help me out. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2sK7q.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2sK7q.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
