<p>I was trying to align center the value of h:outputText tag which is surrounded by div tag. I found out that example 1) meets my goal however I was hoping to use css class to meet the need but I've not been successful. Example 2) is what I have tried which failed.</p>  <pre><code>Example 1) &lt;div align="center"&gt;     &lt;h:outputText value="Have a blessed day!" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Example 2) &lt;div class="header"&gt;     &lt;h:outputText value="Have a blessed day!" /. &lt;/div&gt;  In css file .header {     align: center;  } // tried also text-align .header {     text-align: center;  } </code></pre>  <p>[update] I'm sorry. It was a false alarm. Indeed text-align worked. The browser I was using, IE 10, displayed cached data so I was misled. </p>
