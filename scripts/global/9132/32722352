<p>I am trying to align the read more button straight, centered under the article but I am not able to do it. It's not changing the position at all. Can someone help me? Here's the CSS</p>  <pre><code>.more-link {   display: inline-block;   padding: 8px 20px;   margin-right: 18px;   border: solid 1px #333333;   -webkit-transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out;   transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out; } </code></pre>
