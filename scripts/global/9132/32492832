<p>This is not a duplicate question. </p>  <p>In a modern Intel CPU, a <code>double</code> on an 8-byte boundary built with <code>x64</code> can be read/write without locking since it is guaranteed to be atomic. Is there a decorator, or how to do I tell the C# compiler to align on an 8-byte boundary.</p>  <p>What is the actual code for the [Align(8)] decorator below?</p>  <pre><code>public class AClass {     [Align(8)]     private static double d1;     [Align(8)]     private static double d2     //and so on } </code></pre>
