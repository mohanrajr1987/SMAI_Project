<p>My blog (hosted on Blogger) is optimized for mobile but when navigating to the blog via Safari on iOS9 on an iPhone 6s, the blog is left aligned. How can I ensure the blog appears centered aligned so there is no blank space along the right side of the screen?</p>  <p>My site is www.theghostguest.com for reference. Thank you!</p>
