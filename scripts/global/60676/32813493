<p>I found the following on github which explains briefly how to setup RBAC with apigility and doctrine. I'm very new to PHP, ZF2 and apigility and I have difficulties understanding the github solution: <a href="https://github.com/remiq/apigility-zfc-rbac-recipe" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/remiq/apigility-zfc-rbac-recipe</a></p>  <p>Here is how my project is set up:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uh2aa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uh2aa.png" alt="My project setup"></a></p>  <p>As you can see I have my Application set up and I modified it so that it wont redirect to apigility's welcome page. I have oauth working and I want to add roles for authorization. I have problems matching folder names with my project. Specifically when it says "Update your OAuth2 users table..." I'm lost from there. I have updated my table and did everything till the end but I get a blank page.</p>
