<p>My Article Entity has collection $internalAuthors</p>  <pre><code>/**  * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity = "ArticleModule\Model\Entities\ArticleInternalAuthor", mappedBy = "article", cascade = {"persist"})  */ protected $internalAuthors; </code></pre>  <p>If I want to clear this collection ($this->internalAuthors->clear()), collection is cleared, but data are still in database.</p>  <p>I must call DQL for delete that authors from database. But I prefer have this kind of logic in entity. I noticed, if I add orphanRemoval = TRUE, to OneToMany declaration, then data are removed also from database.</p>  <p>Is it correct usage of orphanRemoval? Should I use something else?</p>
