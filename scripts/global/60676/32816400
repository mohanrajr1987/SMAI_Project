<p>I have a table named <code>Products</code> in which there is a column <code>id</code>. It has foreign key relationship with <code>prtyID</code> column in <code>ProductTypes</code> Table. I just want to change the column <code>id</code> of <code>Products</code> table to <code>prtyID</code>. How is it possible? Is there any doctrine command is available for that? Please help me to fix this..  </p>
