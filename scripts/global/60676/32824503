<p>I'm working on a project that does NOT have a copy of production DB on development environment.</p>  <p>Sometimes we have an issue with DB migrations - they pass on dev DB but fail in production/testing.</p>  <p>It's often beacuse Dev environent data is loaded from Fixtures that use the latest entities - filling all tables properly.</p>  <p>Is there any easy way to make sure Doctrine Migration(s) will pass in production?</p>  <p>Do you have/know any way to write an automatic tests that will make sure data will be migrated properly without downloading the production/testing DB and running the migration manually?</p>  <p>I would like to avoid downloading a production/testing DB to dev machine so I can check migrations becasue that DB contains private data and it can be quite big.</p>
