<p>In Doctrine 2 ORM one can define an event subscriber to be executed after single entity is loaded. Is there a way to apply such event on the whole collection?</p>  <p>Example code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php class MySubscriber {     public function postLoadCollection($event)     {         $collection = $event-&gt;getCollection();         foreach($collection as $item) {           // do something with each entity         }     }  } </code></pre>
