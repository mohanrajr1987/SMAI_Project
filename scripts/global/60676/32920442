<p>I'm trying to persist Feedback entities in a loop. The problem is, that exactly 1 entity doesn't get persisted (no matter how many entities I want to persist at all; it's always n-1 instead of n).</p>  <p>To understand the following code snippet you have to know that a <strong>survey</strong> entity can have several <strong>feedback</strong> entities (1..n relation).</p>  <p>Let's say $feedbackCount = 10 then just 9 feedback entities get persisted into the database. At the end you also see the doctrine unit of work. There you see that 10 feedback entities get added to to the survey (so the loop is working right) but just 9 feedback entities are listet at the end.</p>  <p>Any ideas guys? </p>  <p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>for ($count = 0; $count &lt; $feedbackCount; $count++) {              $feedback = new Feedback();             $feedback-&gt;setFeedback("no feedback yet");             $feedback-&gt;setSurvey($survey);             // Add feedback to survey             $survey-&gt;addFeedback($feedback);             // Persist Feedback             $entityManager-&gt;persist($survey); // persist($feedback) has same effect         } // end for      $uof = $entityManager-&gt;getUnitOfWork();     dump($uof); </code></pre>  <p>Here's the unit of work of the dump statement: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aLBXO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aLBXO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Here are the yaml entity configs of...</p>  <p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>  <pre><code>manyToOne:     survey:         targetEntity: App\APIBundle\Entity\Survey         inversedBy: feedbacks         cascade: ["persist"]         joinColumn:             name: surveyId             referencedColumnName: id </code></pre>  <p><strong>Survey:</strong></p>  <pre><code>oneToMany:     feedbacks:         targetEntity: App\APIBundle\Entity\Feedback         cascade: ["persist", "merge"]          mappedBy: survey </code></pre>  <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>  <p>As asked by malcom here you see that within the ArrayColletion the Feedback entity(0) has the same properties as Feedback entity(1). There is no difference.
