<p>I'm trying to do a simple <code>-&gt;find()</code> using doctrine/orm 2.5.1.</p>  <p>The query is quite simple:</p>  <pre><code>$this-&gt;get('order_repository')-&gt;find(10); </code></pre>  <p>But this is generating a complex query:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>SELECT s0_.number AS number_0, s0_.state AS state_1, s0_.completed_at AS completed_at_2, s0_.items_total AS items_total_3, s0_.adjustments_total AS adjustments_total_4, s0_.total AS total_5, s0_.created_at AS created_at_6, s0_.updated_at AS updated_at_7, s0_.deleted_at AS deleted_at_8, s0_.id AS id_9, s0_.expires_at AS expires_at_10, s1_.currency AS currency_11, s1_.checkout_state AS checkout_state_12, s1_.payment_state AS payment_state_13, s1_.shipping_state AS shipping_state_14, s2_.quantity AS quantity_15, s2_.unit_price AS unit_price_16, s2_.adjustments_total AS adjustments_total_17, s2_.total AS total_18, s2_.is_immutable AS is_immutable_19, s2_.id AS id_20, s1_.channel_id AS channel_id_21, s1_.shipping_address_id AS shipping_address_id_22, s1_.billing_address_id AS billing_address_id_23, s1_.customer_id AS customer_id_24, s1_.offer_id AS offer_id_25, s2_.order_id AS order_id_26, s2_.variant_id AS variant_id_27 FROM sylius_order s1_ LEFT JOIN sylius_order_item s2_ ON s1_.id = s2_.order_id WHERE (s1_.id = 10) AND (s1_.deleted_at IS NULL)'</p> </blockquote>  <p>With the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 's0_.number' in 'field list'</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can see that s0_ is not defined anywhere on the query. Those alias are automatic from doctrine, i just don't see why it's using s0_ and then skipping it to s1_ on the <code>FROM</code> which has the columns mentioned on s0_.*</p>
