<p>I'm building something with Silex and <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/doctrine.html" rel="nofollow">Doctrine DBAL</a> using a Mysql database.</p>  <p>I was wondering if it considered best practice to close the cursor of a statement and database connection after one's done it. For example: </p>  <pre><code>$sql = '     SELECT         `id`, `userid`, `name`, `content`      FROM          `pages` p      WHERE          p.`userid` in (?)';   $stmt = $conn-&gt;executeQuery(     $sql,     [$userIds],     [\Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::PARAM_INT_ARRAY] );  $rows = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll();  $stmt-&gt;closeCursor();  $conn-&gt;close(); </code></pre>  <p>I can't find any examples of this. Both the Silex and Doctrine doc's don't use the statements but they're there for a reason right? </p>
