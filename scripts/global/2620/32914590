<p>I know that this is a long shot question, but I cannot tell if I'm even on the right path. I have an object <code>P</code> and it has (needs) 30 <code>@ManyToOne</code> relationships.  I am trying to pull a list of 2500 records. I notice that if I request the data <code>EAGERLY</code> it takes about 60 seconds. if I request the data <code>LAZILY</code> it only take 5 seconds to get the data but then it takes about 55 seconds to loop through the list in my jsp (I am displaying all fields of object <code>P</code>). I understand that 30 relationships this way are a lot. I am ok with it taking 60 seconds as I plan to paginate the page anyway. My question is, Do these speeds sound normal (good) or does it sound like I am missing important optimization? </p>  <p>any pointer would be help - I have been looking into this all week and really need any kind of help.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
