<p>I use hibernate-entitymanager 4.3.11.Final and Mysql 5.6.25</p>  <p>My Classes</p>  <pre><code>public enum Status {     READY,     FAILED,     SUCCEED }  @Entity public class Execution{      @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)     private Status status;      ... } </code></pre>  <p>Actually, the hibernate is used to keep the statuses as string. However, it changed its behavior after a while and it keeps the enum field as BLOB now. What is the reason?</p>
