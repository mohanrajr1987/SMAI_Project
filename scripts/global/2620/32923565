<p>Should entity objects for databases execute code inside them? Because I'm hearing mixed answers from the people around me. Some people tell me if should only contain fields you set and others said you can do whatever you want inside them.</p>  <p>I wrote an example below so you know what I mean (Pretend that I have all of the appropriate try catches and throws:</p>  <pre><code>@Entity public class Man {      private Long id;     private final String name;     private final double height;     private final double weight;     private final double bmi;      public Man(String name) {          ManData data = new ManData(name);          this.name = name;         this.height = data.getHeight;         this.weight = data.getWeight;         this.bmi = BMI.calculate(height, weight);      }  } </code></pre>  <p>1) Pretend that the <code>ManData</code> object gets its information from the internet. 2) The <code>bmi</code> is also calculated from received data, not passed through. </p>  <p>Is do this kind of thing inside Entities okay?</p>
