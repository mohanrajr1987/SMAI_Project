<p>I have an entity </p>  <pre><code>@Entity public class Parcel implements Serializable {     @OneToOne     private Place sender;     @OneToOne     private Place recipient;     @Column     private String number; } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, I have two objects of Place there. How I can create a relation between Parcel objects and Place objects? Is it possible to have two <code>@OneToOne</code> mapping between this objects or I should use <code>@Embedded</code> to do this.  I need to have a sender data and receiver data of the parcel, but they are of the same type. What is best way to solve that problem?</p>
