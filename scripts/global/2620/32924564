<p>I have created a spring-boot based java application that uses spring's tasks.  This is a console based java application that also uses hibernate to access database.  This application is based on a spring sample for tasks and uses annotations instead of configuration files. For hibernate, I am actually using hibernate.cfg.xml and am initializing the hibernate session factory myself.</p>  <p>I wanted to use Spring's declaration transaction management but they are not working because I have not been able to find sample of how to initialize spring session factory through annotations.  All samples show configuration through a configuration files.  Can anybody point to how to initialize hibernate session factory through spring using annotations and code so that spring's declarative transactions would work.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Waqar</p>
