<p>I am writing a simple fade-slideshow with <code>previous</code> and <code>next</code> buttons.</p>  <p>The problem is that when I click the <code>next</code> button very quickly (for example 2 times), before the first event finished, the second one will be executed, so for less than a second I will see, two images in my page.</p>  <pre><code>    $("#next_button").click(function (){         $("#slide"+current_slide).fadeOut(FADE_DURATION, function () {             current_slide ++;             current_slide = current_slide % slides_number;             $("#slide"+current_slide).fadeIn(FADE_DURATION, function (){                 $(".slide_image").not("#slide"+current_slide).attr("style", "display: none;");             });         });     }); </code></pre>  <ul> <li><p>In the last line, after <code>fadeIn()</code>, I even tried to hide everything except current image, wishing the issue will be solved, but that doesn't work.</p></li> <li><p>I read something about <code>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</code> but I couldn't use it, or maybe it wasn't my solution.</p></li> </ul>  <p>How to force <code>jQuery</code> to ignore executing any similar events, before one of those same events, get finished?</p>
