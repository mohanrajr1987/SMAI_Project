<p>I have been trying to teach myself c# through tutorials and this website and I didn't know how to make my "character" move using the arrow keys so I copied code from here hoping it would work and everything is fine until I run and then it throws me this error  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 1   No overload for 'pictureBox1_Click' matches delegate   'System.EventHandler' c:\users\collin\documents\visual studio   2013\projects\my_rpg\my_rpg\form1.designer.cs 80  39  My_RPG</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here is the code I copied (I did change the name from whatever it was originally to pictureBox1 so that is correct"</p>  <pre><code>public MainScreen()     {         InitializeComponent();         KeyDown += new KeyEventHandler(MainScreen_KeyDown);         if (characterCreated == false)         {             playGameBtn.ForeColor = Color.Gray;          }     } private void pictureBox1_Click(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)     {         int x = pictureBox1.Location.X;         int y = pictureBox1.Location.Y;          if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Right)         {             x += 2;         }         else if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Left)          {             x -= 2;         }         else if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Up)         {             y += 2;         }         else if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Down)         {             y -= 2;         }          pictureBox1.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(x, y);      } </code></pre>  <p>And then if I click on the error it sends me to this line of code that if I edit then it throws me errors</p>  <pre><code>        this.pictureBox1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.pictureBox1_Click); </code></pre>
