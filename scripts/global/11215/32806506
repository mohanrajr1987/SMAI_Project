<p>I'm creating a XML file creator for school, it's a very easy task for me, but I want to add the feature that when the user click on the 'x' to exit from the program, the program ask the user to save the file with the last modifications he made.</p>  <p>I searched all arround the internet for few days, but I din't find nothing that can handle the exit by the 'x' button in c.</p>  <p>Do you know something about that?</p>  <p>Thanks for the help, love this community!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>I'm not using any GUI libraries, it's all by command line.</p>
