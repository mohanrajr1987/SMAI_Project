<p>I am using simple event handler in the while loop. </p>  <p>I have value change event for the boolean button. There is some code that takes 3-4 seconds to execute. </p>  <p>The problem is I am not able to click anything on my Front panel during this period. Is it possible to allow the user to click on other controls when event handler is working on some case (as I understand the event handler is able to collect all events and process them ASAP)? </p>
