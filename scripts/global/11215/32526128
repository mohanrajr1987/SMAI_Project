<p>I have a UI in Codenameone where a container contains another container which contains some widgets.  On the bottom level container I'm able to receive pointerDragged events but not pointerPressed.  These (pointerPressed) seem to be consumed by the widgets on the top of the hierarchy, but not move down to the bottom container.</p>  <p>How can I fix this?  </p>  <p>I'd like to do this to detect left-right swipes on the bottom container.  Is there perhaps a better way to do that?</p>
