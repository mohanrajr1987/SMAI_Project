<p>I've got an EventHandler, which is fired on some event. From time to time that event is blocked by Apache Felix (or OSGi container itself). Is there a way to "unblock" that event?</p>  <p>By "blocked" I mean that my event handler is not fired. I'm sure that event was fired, but my event handler didn't do it's logic. I assume that this is a safety feature, but maybe somehow I can change something in OSGi configuration to never block my events?</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
