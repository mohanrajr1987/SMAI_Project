<p>I'm new to Java. I found the following code snippet online while trying to understand Java's Event Handling mechanism. This code is taken from <a href="http://www.javatpoint.com/event-handling-in-java" rel="nofollow">JavaTpoint.com</a></p>  <pre><code>import java.awt.*;   import java.awt.event.*;    class AEvent extends Frame implements ActionListener{   TextField tf;   AEvent(){    tf=new TextField();   tf.setBounds(60,50,170,20);    Button b=new Button("click me");   b.setBounds(100,120,80,30);    b.addActionListener(this);    add(b);add(tf);    setSize(300,300);   setLayout(null);   setVisible(true);    }    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){   tf.setText("Welcome");   }    public static void main(String args[]){   new AEvent();   }   } </code></pre>  <p>I have studied the various uses of "this" keyword in Java &amp; have realized that it is used to pass the current object as an argument to the following method.</p>  <pre><code>b.addActionListener(this); </code></pre>  <p>However, what I don't understand is why there is a need to pass the object as an argument. What exactly is the program accomplishing by doing that?</p>  <p>I'm sorry if such questions already exist or if it sounds like a stupid question, but I'm just a beginner.</p>  <p>Thank you for your time!!</p>
