<p>I am trying to write a method that goes through a list of items - for each one adds it to a form, then waits for the user to input some data and click a button. However I have no idea of what I should/could be using to create this.</p>  <pre><code>foreach (string s in List) {     txtName.Text = s;     //wait for button click...      // When the user is ready, they click the button to continue the loop. } </code></pre>  <p>So far all I have found is the <code>EventWaitHandle</code> class, which seems to only apply for threads.</p>  <p>How can I achieve this?</p>
