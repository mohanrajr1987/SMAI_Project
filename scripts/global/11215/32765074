<p>I recently saw this comment:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Please, <em>please</em> don't put JavaScript inside HTML elements. It's sloppy, needless, and a PITA to work with.</p> </blockquote>  <p>In <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8839067/using-onclick-and-onsubmit-together">this post</a>. What is (are you) <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/257493/incognito">incognito</a> getting at? Does he (do you) mean that every event should be wired manually in a piece of JavaScript<strike> / JQuery</strike> code (JQuery struck as I tend to work primarily with JavaScript only, without the plugins)?</p>  <p><em>Does best practice dictate</em> that function calls should be attached using a JavaScript routine, or is it more readable to provide the function call (not a string of incessant JavaScript) directly in the mark-up so that you know what is being called in direct relation to that DOM element, e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;button id="myButt" onclick="shake(myButt);" value="Shake it!" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>...or am I barking up the wrong tree?</p>
