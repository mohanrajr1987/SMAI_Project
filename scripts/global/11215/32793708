<p>I am trying to hook into the window drag event of every active/visible windows using C# in a System tray app. I have the code to find and move all the windows figured out using PInvoke, but am unable to figure out how to hook into the drag event.</p>  <p>My goal is to run the program in the background and while dragging a window be able to snap it into preset locations (showing preview windows while the drag is occurring and snapping when released).</p>  <p>How would I hook into the window drag event?</p>
