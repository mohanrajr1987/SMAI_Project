<p>I'm running in to an issue where I'm getting the following output (repeatedly, with all tests) when running a bunch of CasperJS tests using Grunt:</p>  <pre><code>FAIL TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating '(casper.currentHTTPStatus).should') #    type: uncaughtError #    file: allTestsND21/integrationTests/testAccountHarvesting.js:2702 #    error: 'null' is not an object (evaluating '(casper.currentHTTPStatus).should') #           TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating '(casper.currentHTTPStatus).should') #               at /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/Acceptance_Testing/jobs/CasperJS-NuDetect21-Acceptance-Tests-Fake-Accounts-NDSQA/workspace/qa_scripts/main/casperscripts/integrationTests/coop-repo/allTestsND21/includes/ndHelper.js:2702 #               at runStep (/usr/lib/node_modules/casperjs/modules/casper.js:1553) #               at checkStep (/usr/lib/node_modules/casperjs/modules/casper.js:399) #    stack: not provided </code></pre>  <p>The odd thing about this is that running another test suite works just fine (another set of tests but structured in the same way. Both suites share their own version of the <code>ndhelper.js</code> file. One works, one doesn't.</p>  <p>I'm not able to find a fundamental difference between the two other than different functionality. Also, when the tests are run on their own (not via Grunt), they all run properly. I'm using the <code>grunt-casperjs</code> plugin that can be found on GitHub. CasperJS version is 2.0.0B3 and PhantomJS is 1.9.8.</p>  <p>Any suggestions as to what might be causing this would be great. I can provide more info as required.</p>  <p>Cheers, Darwin</p>
