<p>I have a gruntfile with few tasks configured. Some of the use functions like:</p>  <pre><code>middleware: (connect, options, defaultMiddleware) =&gt;                     proxy = require('grunt-connect-proxy/lib/utils').proxyRequest;                     window.alert proxy                     return [proxy].concat(defaultMiddleware) </code></pre>  <p>I wanted to use alerts or console.log to be able to debug this but whenever I try to run grunt it tells me "alert is not defined", "console is not defined".</p>  <p>How else am I able to debug this?</p>
