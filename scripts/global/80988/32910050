<p>I'm attempting to move from font icons (icomoon.io) to SVG sprites. <strong>Is it possible to use SVG sprites without needing &lt; svg > markup for each icon instance?</strong></p>  <p>What I really liked about the font icons was that I didn't have to clutter my HTML with any additional elements to get the icon to display. I usually just targeted a simple class on whatever element I wanted the icon to display and then used pseudo selectors to display the icon, e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;h1 class="news"&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;  h1.user:before {   font-family: 'icons';   content: '\news'; } </code></pre>  <p>That made a lot of sense to me, and all of my icons were easily managed almost completely in CSS. I rarely had to touch my HTML as long as my markup contained appropriate classes.</p>  <p>I've since switched my build system to Grunt and thought I'd give SVG sprites a try.

To me, an icon is usually presentation that should be separate from document structure. Are we doing it this way simply because of the state of SVG support in browsers?</p>  <p>Ideally, I'd love to be able to do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;h1 class="news"&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;  h1.news:before {   display: inline-block;   width: px;   height: px;   background: url(icons.svg#news) no-repeat; } </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://blog.jamesflorentino.com/2012/07/21/svg-spriting-in-css.html" rel="nofollow">This post</a> seems to be closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm not sure of browser support and how to do it automatically in a build system like Grunt.</p>
