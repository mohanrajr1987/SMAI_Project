<p>I've implemented <strong>grunt-ssh</strong> plugin in order to download assets from the remote server but with no luck. There're no files listed for download.</p>  <p>Official grunt-ssh site has no explanation about the download method, there're few issue threads only.</p>  <p>My code looks like:</p>  <pre><code>sftp: {     options: {         host: 'assets.xxxxx.xx',         path: '/',         port: 22,         username: 'xxxx',         privateKey: grunt.file.read('/home/xxxxxx/.ssh/id_rsa'),         passphrase: 'xxxxxx',         createDirectories: true,         directoryPermissions: parseInt(755, 8),         srcBasePath: '/home/files/assets/',         destBasePath: '/app/',         showProgress: true,         mode: 'download'     },     files: {         'images/': 'images/*'     } } </code></pre>  <p>There's no error during sftp execute, connection is established successfully. I've tried changing paths in many ways but still no files for download.</p>  <p>Can someone help or point out for some another grunt ssh plugin.</p>
