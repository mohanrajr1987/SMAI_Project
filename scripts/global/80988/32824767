<p>I'm developing several AngularJS applications and I'm looking for best practices how I can share code, especially directives, between these projects. The biggest problem I'm facing is the following:</p>  <p>Most of my directives contain at least one js file and a html template. The js file often contains a reference to the template. When I include the same js file from two different projects, what's the best way to handle the different paths?</p>  <p>There may be better ways to handle this situation I can't even think of. So, I would like to know if someone has experiences with this situation and how this is handled. Thanks!</p>
