<p>I want to create ReactJS components that delivers its dependencies by itself. Mainly those dependencies are Markup, LESS and JS. </p>  <p>Each of this component may have one or more of LESS/CSS and JSX/JS files associated with it. </p>  <p>Now let's say one of my web page is using three of such React component on the web page, <strong>the solution should be smart enough to compile LESS, JSX and other such dependencies and deliver combined/minified CSS and JS per page</strong>. In other words, there would be just one CSS file and one JS files per page.</p>  <p>I am open to any server side/client side technologies or frameworks such as Node, Grunt, Gulp, Browserify and so on.</p>  <p>Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
