<p>I am using bower for package management. Also for automatically putting bower components to HTML I am using grunt-wiredep. I got both of them integrated into my project and working well.</p>  <p>For the production server, I want to minify and concat the bower components and put the path of this new file to the my HTML. I use bower_concat for concatenating the minified files.</p>  <p>But how will I replace wiredep script tags with this concatenated script tag? Is there any automated way of doing it?</p>
