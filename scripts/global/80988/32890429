<p>I have a Grunt setup on my machine that's running SASS, Compass, Watch, Uglify... that kind of stuff. I've installed it using the command line (npm install...) from a tutorial. </p>  <p>I want to create a Grunt folder for another project. Is it okay to just copy that first folder and change the names? Is there some reason I should install the new one from the command line as well?</p>
