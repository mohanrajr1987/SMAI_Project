<p>I am experiencing a strange issue while using the grunt-contrib-less and grunt-contrib-watch plugins together. Sometimes the watch task will run the less task exactly one time when I save a watched Less file as I would expect... but sometimes it will run the less task times multiple times back-to-back after a single save of a watched Less file -- sometimes even non-stop until I stop Grunt!</p>  <p>I am able to reproduce this error even by using a minimalist test case, as follows:</p>  <p><strong>npm packages:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>grunt 0.4.5</li> <li>grunt-contrib-less 1.0.1</li> <li>grunt-contrib-watch 0.6.1</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Test Directory:</strong></p>  <pre><code>testfolder/     node_modules/         [package folders]     Gruntfile.js     package.json     test.less </code></pre>  <p><strong>Gruntfile:</strong></p>  <pre><code>module.exports = function (grunt) {     grunt.initConfig({         less: {             target: {                 files: {                     "test.css": "test.less"                 }             }         },         watch: {             less: {                 files: "test.less",                 tasks: "less"             }         }     });      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-less');     grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');      grunt.registerTask('default', ['watch']); }; </code></pre>  <p><strong>test.less</strong></p>  <pre><code>// Hello world  a {     color: red; } </code></pre>  <p>If I run "grunt" using this setup and then save test.less, the watch task will trigger the less task, create the test.css file, and then, in most cases, it will run the less task again, sometimes just 1 more time but sometimes many more times... Since the effect is random, does this maybe have something to do with my code editor? I am able to reproduce this error using Visual Studio and Notepad++, and sometimes the less task will run simply when I open test.less. Any help would be appreciated!</p>  <hr>  <h2>Update</h2>  <p>Below are some additional test cases that may shed some light on what the issue might be. Perhaps it is OS-related? Note that while the behavior still varies by code editor in Windows 10, the task only ever runs one time after it is triggered.</p>  <p><strong>Windows 10</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Visual Studio Community 2015, Notepad - Less task runs once after any save of test.less</li> <li>Visual Studio Code 0.7.20, Notepad++ 6.8.3 - Less task runs once after save only if test.less has been changed</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Windows 7</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Visual Studio Professional 2012, Notepad - Less task runs a random number of times after any save or open of test.less</li> <li>Notepad++ 6.7.5 - Less task runs a random number of times after any open of test.less or after save only if test.less has been changed</li> </ul>
