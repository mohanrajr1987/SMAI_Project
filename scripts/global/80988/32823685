<p>I used to work with compiled Bootstrap files for custom Bootstrap templates. Now I've downloaded Bootstrap source files and set them up with Grunt.</p>  <p>I also have third party <code>js</code> and <code>css</code> files I've uploaded into the <code>/dist</code> folder along with <code>html</code> files. However, running <code>$ grunt dist</code> cleared the <code>/dist</code> folder and replaced everything in it with compiled files.</p>  <p>How do you organize the Bootstrap project to have it all in one place?</p>
