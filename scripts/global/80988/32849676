<p>I'm using grunt with grunt-contrib-requirejs to build my angular project. It works fine generating a file which also includes the angular library. Now, my component needs to be integrated in a page which already includes angular library (as an AMD module), so there's no point to bundle the entire library into my project javascript file.</p>  <p>How can I specify in the requirejs config not to bundle the angularjs library?</p>
