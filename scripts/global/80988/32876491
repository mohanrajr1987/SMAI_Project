<p>I'm trying to watch my app's <em>js</em> files and dependencies's <em>css &amp; js</em> files for link them in my index.html file.</p>  <p>I'm using <strong>grunt-contrib-watch</strong> for the job, but it seems that it doesn't work as I expected. There are directories in the file system tree that doesn't trigger the watch task.</p>  <p>this is my grunt watch config:</p>  <pre><code>watch: {             vendors: {                 files: ['www/vendors/**/*.js', 'www/vendors/**/*.css'],                 tasks: ['wiredep']             },             app: {                 files: ['www/app/**/*.js', 'www/app/**/*.css', 'www/css/**/*.css'],                 tasks: ['tags']             }         } </code></pre>  <p>this is my folders structure:</p>  <pre><code>    C:.     └───www         ├───app         │   └───modules         │       └───main         │           └───controllers         ├───css         ├───images             └───vendors             ├───angular             ├───bootstrap             │   ├───dist             │   │   ├───css             │   │   ├───fonts             │   │   └───js             │   ├───fonts             │   ├───grunt             │   ├───js             │   └───less             └───jquery                 ├───dist                 └───src                     ├─── ...                 </code></pre>  <p>Here is the PROBLEM. When I add/delete a js or css file to a directory that <strong>already have js/css file</strong>, the watcher task triggers and it works. But any other folder that doesn't have js/css placed in (and the folder is placed in <strong>vendors</strong> or <strong>app</strong> folders), doesn't trigger the watcher, and the task won't run.</p>  <p>Why is that? and how can I solve it? I want the watcher to work on any level in the directory's tree.</p>  <p>I'm using grunt 0.4.5, and grunt-contrib-watch version 0.6.1.</p>
