<p>I'm looking for an answer to either version of my question:</p>  <p>Does the term "slug" in the node.js/ Heroku context have the same meaning as "slug" in Django? (see: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/427102/what-is-a-slug-in-django">What is a &quot;slug&quot; in Django?</a>), and is it the same meaning in other web frameworks? </p>  <p>That is to say...</p>  <p>Is it generally a title string prepped for appending to a URL (by eliminating spaces between words), regardless of the language or framework?</p>
