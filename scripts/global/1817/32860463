<p>In my app, user get data from server, then I save these data to local file of phone, so same data don't need to load from server again. If there are some new messages send to user, these data need to load from server. I intended to do it myself, but it seems this functionality is not so simple as I imagined. I think this is a common functionality, is there any framework focus on it?  Please give me some guidance,tks!</p>
