<p>I want to choose RIA framework to make JavaFX applications(actually to rewrite .Net fat client). I found JRebirth and Griffon can do what I what. But what are the difference and which framework provides faster development and more clean code. Hope you help me, and if there are some other nice JavaFX frameworks, please tell.</p>
