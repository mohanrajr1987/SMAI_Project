<p>I need to release a framework with bitcode enabled which turns out as a hassle. I set 'Enable Bitcode' in the project's settings to 'YES' and it builds cleanly for both a real device and a simulator.</p>  <p>I wanted to test the library so I integrated it to a new app I created for this purpose but now it only build for simulators. When I try to build for a real device I get:</p>  <pre><code>ld: '/path/to/Framework.framework/Company(File.o)' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture armv7 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>  <p>Like I said, I had built it with Bitcode enabled so I'm not sure why this happens.</p>  <p>Any ideas? thanks</p>
