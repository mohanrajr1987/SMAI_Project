I have no idea what is going on at class.</p>  <p>I'm trying to get Software Engineering degree, but it seems too hard with those courses.</p>  <p>I need anything like: guideline, online resources, link to a community to help me clarify those methodologies and frameworks. </p>  <p>I've tried to read many articles on website, but everything is so unclear with me.
