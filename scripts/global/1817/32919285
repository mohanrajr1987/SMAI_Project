<p>I have a framework building where it combines both Objective-C and Swift. My issue is that some of the Objective-C code within the framework needs to use some of the Swift classes in the framework. In order to do this, I do:</p>  <pre><code>#import "FrameworkName-Swift.h"  </code></pre>  <p>in my Objective-C code in the framework. And here the first problem arises. The -Swift.h header is not located by Xcode this way. Digging around in the Derived Data, it turns out the -Swift.h file is located in the Framework/Headers folder, which in of itself seems odd. Should the -Swift.h file really be an exposed header for the framework? The -Swift.h file is an intermediary .h file, right?</p>  <p>To work around this issue of not locating the -Swift.h, I tried:</p>  <pre><code>#import &lt;FrameworkName/FrameworkName-Swift.h&gt; </code></pre>  <p>BUT, while now locating the -Swift.h file, this causes a severe and compilation-fatal rash of cyclic dependencies in Xcode, with messages like:</p>  <pre><code>Cyclic dependency in module 'FrameworkName' Could not build module 'UIKit' </code></pre>  <p>Here's what those look like in-situ:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gcQpQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gcQpQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>
