<p>I have a funny problem after i migrated to .NET Framework 4.5.2, here are my code:</p>  <pre><code>QuoteMachineryColor c1 = new QuoteMachineryColor();       c1.ColorName = "单色";  // Problem in here       c1.InclusiveOperationQuantity = 2000;                 c1.InitialCost = 300;                 c1.PrintPlateFeePerSet = 40;                 c1.QuoteMachinery = qm;                 qmcHandler.Save(c1, false); </code></pre>  <p>qmcHandler is using nhibernate to persist the object to database, and the ColorName end up with in database is <strong>¶Ô¿ª»ú</strong>, however exactly the same code was working fine in the same machine with .NET Framework 4.0.</p>  <p>Anyone got a clue?</p>  <pre><code>OS: Windows 8.1 Enterprise English Visual Studio 2015 .NET Framework 4.5.2 </code></pre>
