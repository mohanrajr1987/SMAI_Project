<p>I wish to create an iOS application in which a portion of content is released each day and a notification is given to the user. It will consist of text, pictures and videos. The content that is released will ask the users a question which will determine the next piece of content the user is presented. (An interactive non-linear story.) </p>  <p>Is there a way by which this can easily be done? Are there any such existing systems? (I have looked at <a href="http://twinery.org/" rel="nofollow">Twine</a> as of being a possible solution?)</p>
