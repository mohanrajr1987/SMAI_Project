<p>I am new here. I try to program in php but I have issues with framework CodeIgniter and understanding MVC. I can write a logon script in Codeigniter but I don't know how to put two scripts on this same page. For example: I have page where I have news and I want to have there small login module on the right side of site. How to do this?  To display news I use controller News.php where I load view to this page.  What should I do to display Login module near news? I thought to do one controller Page.php with Logon and News methods but I do not know if it's a good idea.</p>
