<p>I have a dynamic framework in swift that currently is linking in another framework that is written in Objective C.  This works but its annoying because the Objective C framework really only 2 files and I was wondering if there is a way to bring this into my swift framework.</p>  <p>If this was an application I'd user <strong>Bridging-Header</strong> but that is not supported inside a swift framework.  </p>  <p>My framework is called <strong>GDL90</strong> and consists of only swift files.</p>  <p>My Objective-C framework consists of:</p>  <ul> <li><code>GeoidCalculator.h</code></li> <li><code>GeoidCalculator.m</code></li> <li><code>EGM96</code> (data file)</li> <li><code>CORCOEF</code>(data file)</li> </ul>  <p>Real simple - right?  So I wanted to see if there was a way to just add this code into my swift project.  </p>  <h3>Attempt #1 - add my code into the "umbrella header?" <code>GDL90.h</code></h3>  <p>I added my file an get the warning <strong>Include of non-modular header inside framework module 'GDL90'</strong></p>  <p>Ok so thats no dice.</p>  <h3>Attempt 2</h3>  <p>I figured I needed to make a module map file.  </p>  <p>So I made a directory called <code>${SRCROOT}/GDL90/EGM96</code> and inside I created <code>EGM96.module.modulemap</code></p>  <pre><code>module EGM96 {     header "GeoidCalculator.h"     export * } </code></pre>  <p>And then in one of my swift files i have <code>import EGM96</code> which doesn't seem to be found.</p>  <p>In my build settings i have:</p>  <p><code>Define Modules</code> turned on and I'm pointing to the <code>modulemap</code> file from my <strong>Module Map File</strong> item</p>  <p>Am I missing something??</p>
