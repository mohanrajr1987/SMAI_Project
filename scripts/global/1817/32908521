<p>I have an Xcode project (Swift iOS app) that has a few subproject (Swift frameworks) that are set as target dependencies. I'm also using Cocoapods for third-party frameworks &amp; libraries, but don't appear to have any issues with those. When building for the simulator I often get one of these errors for one of my subprojects:</p>  <pre><code>1. error: failed to remove /***/Debug-iphonesimulator/***.framework/DeviceModels.plist: “DeviceModels.plist” couldn’t be removed.   2. &lt;unknown&gt;:0: error: unable to load output file map Command **strong text**/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swiftc failed with exit code 1 </code></pre>  <p>Usually if I build a second time or build the framework by itself before building the app, these errors go away.</p>  <p>Also, when I'm building for an iOS Device I get these errors:</p>  <pre><code>1. error: lipo: can't move temporary file: /***/*** to file:   /***/Debug-iphoneos/***.framework.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/***.lipo (No such file or directory) 2. Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/dsymutil emitted errors but did not return a nonzero exit code to indicate failure 3. *** error: Couldn't code sign /***/Debug-iphoneos/***.framework/Frameworks/libswiftFoundation.dylib: codesign failed with exit code 1 4. error: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/lipo: can't move temporary file: /***/Debug-iphoneos/***.framework/*** to file: /***/Debug-iphoneos/***.framework/***.lipo (No such file or directory) 5. Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/lipo emitted errors but did not return a nonzero exit code to indicate failure </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>
