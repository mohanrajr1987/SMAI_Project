<p>As a beginner looking at Sails, I see simple examples leading one through, but see nothing that tells me what is actually happening in this framework.  Thus, I don't see where I would add a new page or change a layout, etc.  When a Java program or servlet is called, I can see exactly where it starts, where it services events, etc. and how they are handled.  PHP, most other systems, the same way.  </p>  <p>So, what is the architecture of Sails?  A diagram showing what's on the server, how the application one creates is started and how it gets events and services them.  What is the structure of a page?  What affects the layout?  If I want to have 3 buttons on the bottom of the page that lead to other pages, how do I do that?</p>  <p>I have an existing MySQL database.  Can I generate a CRUD application for it as I can in Ruby on Rails?  Show me.</p>  <p>Very difficult to see how to actually do useful work, not just play around, when there are only trivial examples that don't usually work and if you make any changes, you have to delete everything and start completely over!  To be useful, you have to know where things are and if something is not working, where to look to fix it.  You have to grok the system!</p>
