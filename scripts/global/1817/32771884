<p>I have a xcode project which generates a binary and depends on some frameworks inside xcode.app, Currently I add the framework search path using:</p>  <pre><code>install_name_tool -add_rpath "/Applications/Xcode-6.4.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib" "$(PREFIX)/bin/myBinary" </code></pre>  <p>However with every xcode version change it breaks, and some people might name their xcode app in a different way(like xcode7.0).</p>  <p><code>xcode-select -p</code> can give me the current developer dir, so is there a similar way to make my binary search for this path.</p>  <p>Alternatives that I am trying to avoid:</p>  <ol> <li>As an alternative I could always copy the framework and bundle it with the binary but that's what I am trying to avoid.</li> <li>I could provide an additional script that changes the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and then runs my script.</li> </ol>
