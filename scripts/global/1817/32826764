<p>Was building Xcode project when suddenly this : </p>  <pre><code>ld: framework not found ReplayKit for architecture arm64  clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>  <p>The only things I changed (or at least, I am aware of changing) where the building settings. Cannot find the framework. I cleaned the project and made sure no other changes where made to it. Regardless, the build fails. Pulled the project from Source Tree as well. It's something from my end, but I can't figure out what. Oh, it also hives me 2 warning just prior to the error, regarding 2 folders it can't find.</p>
