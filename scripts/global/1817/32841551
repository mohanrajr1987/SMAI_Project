<p>From the beginning of my project, I use a custom framework, let's call it "custom.framework". But there was a bug in this framework and now I want to use another version of the "custom.framework".</p>  <p>At first, I simply removed the "custom.framework" file from my project and added the new one. But nothing changed, the bug was still there.</p>  <p>After multiple tries and hours, I understood that Xcode add the old version in memory and used this one instead of the new version. I know it because in the new version I added a method and when I cmd+click the class I've add the method into, it's not there and the file's path is unavailable.</p>  <p>Searching through the web, I tried to change some version parameters to my framework projects: Compatibility version, Curent Library version, Framework version. But this didn't change anything to Xcode which keeps using the old version.</p>  <p>I also tried to make the framework's project as a sub-project and add resulting framework as a dependency to my target. It worked well, but as the framework's project is on a separated remote git repository, I don't think this is an acceptable solution.</p>  <p>So my last try was to build a "custom2.framework", to force Xcode to use the real file and not some cached version. But again, it doesn't work and when building I get errors telling me that all my classes in custom2.framework are duplicated symbols of its cached version of "custom.framework".</p>  <p>So my question is simple: how can I finally tell Xcode to deleted its cached old version and let me use the file I gave him? I already tried to delete my project's derivedData but it seems cached frameworks aren't there.... I'm so desperate :(</p>
