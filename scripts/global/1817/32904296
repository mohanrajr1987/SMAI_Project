<p>Out of nowhere linker is saying that <code>ld: framework not found LogEntries</code>. My project is using <strong>CocoaPods</strong> with <strong>Xcode 7</strong>.</p>  <p>What is more:</p>  <ol> <li><p><strong>Full Path</strong> for <strong>LogEntries.framework</strong> (after I added them under the <strong>Link Binary With Libraries</strong>) is directing to <code>/Users/kovalsky/Documents/projects/swifttestproject/build/Debug-iphoneos/LogEntries.framework</code> but <strong>Debug-iphoneos</strong> directory is missing. How could it be? My <strong>Architectures</strong> and <strong>Valid Architectures</strong> are <strong>arm64</strong>, <strong>armv7</strong> and <strong>armv7s</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>I have a build warning <code>Target 'LogEntries' of project 'Pods' was rejected as an implicit dependency for 'LogEntries.framework' because its architectures 'arm64' didn't contain all required architectures 'armv7 arm64 armv7s'</code></p></li> </ol>
