<p>My goal in this was to create an iOS framework that incorporates both Swift and Objective-C that I could use in my development projects. The nature of this framework is that the framework itself is undergoing development. So, it was important that each time I build a project using this framework (I'll call projects using the framework "using" projects for lack of a better term), I wanted to make sure the framework itself was re-built. I wanted this to be a framework because I have a few using apps across which I want to use the same framework code. I have struggled with this for a good hunk of today, and wasted a lot of time on something that should have been, in my thoughts at least, easier. So, I'll share my process.</p>
