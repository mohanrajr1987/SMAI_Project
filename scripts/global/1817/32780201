<p>I want to create a simple Java-program on Windows 7 that can communicate with a simple Android app. I only want to be able to send strings, nothing more.</p>  <p>What do I need to do this? I've been trying to look around but information seems very scarce. Is there a framework or library for Java that I can download in order to provide a basic implemented interface I can use to send bytes, etc?</p>  <p>I found something about "BlueCove but it appeared to be old and outdated? What frameworks for bluetooth are there out there (I'm mostly concerned with finding information about how to implement the Windows 7 application)</p>
