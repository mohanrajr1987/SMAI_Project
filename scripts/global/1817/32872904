<p>I have a project written in Swift and I need to use a library called Foo, written in Objective-C, and available via Cocoapods. To use Foo, I have to specify it in my Podfile, run pod install, and create a bridging header that imports Foo/Foo.h. This I'm fine with.</p>  <p>But a new version of Foo has come out. And it marks ReactiveCocoa as a dependency in its podspec. When I run pod install, my project will see this and pulls down ReactiveCocoa as well. But my issue is that Foo does not know about ReactiveCocoa. Any line of code in Foo that references a ReactiveCocoa class does not compile.</p>  <p>How do I fix this issue?</p>
