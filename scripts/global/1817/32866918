<p>I'm trying to convert an existing GitHub repo (<a href="https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore" rel="nofollow">RMStore</a>, but it could apply to any repo) to be compatible with <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage" rel="nofollow">Carthage</a>. This requires adding a Framework target to the Xcode Project. I want the resulting framework to be called <code>RMStore.framework</code>, however I cannot create a new target to the Xcode project called <strong>RMStore</strong> because there is already a target with that name, which builds a static library (and I don't want to get rid of that target).</p>  <p>I created a new target called <strong>RMStoreFramework</strong>, but the resulting framework is called <code>RMStoreFramework.framework</code>, which is not what I want. So, is there a way to either: </p>  <ol> <li>create two targets with the same name or alternatively,</li> <li>make the name of the resulting framework be different to the target name?</li> </ol>
