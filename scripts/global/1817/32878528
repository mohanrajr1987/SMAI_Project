<p>We currently have a (PostgreSQL) table that has 10 columns, 6 have an index on them. The datatypes of the indexed columns are strings, numerics and timestamps.</p>  <p>The table is our most used table (currently 5,719,831 rows) with a lot of concurrent reads and writes. It became the bottleneck of our system.</p>  <p>I can't remove the indexes because reads would become slow, leaving them slows down writes. Both have to be fast.</p>  <p>Which DB/framework/approach would you suggest?</p>  <p><em>(I know this question doesn't fit perfectly into Q/A)</em></p>
