<p>In Xcode when I build the app using "Deployment Target" 6.0 or 6.1 it works fine but if I change the target to 7.0 or higher I get undefined symbols error. I've tried removing the framework and adding it back in but still can't seem to get it to build. Not sure if this makes a difference but I have to use "-all_load" for "Other Linker Flags" for this framework. I've also made sure that "Valid Architectures" has armv7 included but I still can't figure this out. Can anyone help me out or point me in the right direction?</p>  <pre><code>Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:  "std::ios_base::Init::~Init()", referenced from:      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(DownSample.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(FskController.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(WavBuffer.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(AE_ManchesterRealTimeDecoder.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(AE_ManchesterState.o)  "std::ios_base::Init::Init()", referenced from:      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(DownSample.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(FskController.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(WavBuffer.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(AE_ManchesterRealTimeDecoder.o)      __GLOBAL__I_a in G4XSwiper(AE_ManchesterState.o)  ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7  clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>
