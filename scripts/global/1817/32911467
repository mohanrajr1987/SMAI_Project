<p>I'm using XCode Version 7.0.1 (7A1001) Carthage version 0.8.0 to checkout: "ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa" "swift2" branch.</p>  <p>I'm not sure why Xcode can't "Jump to definition" of swift code from ReactiveCocoa any more.</p>  <p>I find that it makes it very hard to have to keep going to ReactiveCocoa xocde project to checkout functions and code signatures.</p>  <p>If anyone had this issue i would appreciate a solution.</p>
