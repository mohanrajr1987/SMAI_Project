<p>So I have this db structure:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5ibHa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5ibHa.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Under profile I want email &amp; provider-name to be readable only for admin and Username readable for every logged in user. How I can achieve that?</p>  <p>Here is my rules:</p>  <pre><code>{    "rules":     {      "users":      {        "$uid":        {          // grants write access to the owner of this user account whose uid     must exactly match the key ($uid)         ".write": "auth !== null &amp;&amp; auth.uid === $uid",         "profile":         {           // grants read access only for registered users           ".read": "auth !== null",           "email":           {             // This doesn't work with firebase as I was reading doc.                                   ".read": false           }         }        }      }     } } </code></pre>
