<p>I'm trying to implement login system so it uses random password that is being generated by <code>ref.resetPassword()</code>.</p>  <p>Problem is that the random password becomes invalid after 24 hours.  Tried to change the session length to 24 months (in Login&amp;Auth dashboard tab), but it didn't affect the random password lifetime.</p>  <p>Is there a way to extend lifetime of the random password? Thank you!</p>
