<p>While sniffing the Firebase traffic, I have seen that a code is passed to the auth server so that it always returns a 200 status code. This shows that there is some level of optional security at some level in the authentication protocol.</p>  <p>Is there a way to cause Firebase authentication to fail with an identical error message when the user enters a non-existent email address as when they enter the wrong password?</p>  <p><a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/user-auth.html#section-full-error" rel="nofollow">The <code>INVALID_USER</code> status code</a> gives me concern about the potential for a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OWASP-AT-002)" rel="nofollow">user enumeration attack</a>, in a case where my application has become compromised via script injection.</p>  <p>Information on how to more securely lock down the Firebase auth protocol, and/or some sort of statement about smart rate limiting (somehow distributed attack immune?) being applied would probably go a long way to assuring me that Firebase's built-in email and password auth is indeed secure (assuming Firebase rules are set up correctly, certs aren't compromised on the client, etc).</p>
