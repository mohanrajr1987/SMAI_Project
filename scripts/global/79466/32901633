<p>Today when I updated my Firebase version to the most recent version (v2.4.1) I started receiving the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: "_OBJC_CLASS_$_Firebase", referenced from:   _OBJC_CLASS_$_TEDFirebase in TEDFirebase.o   objc-class-ref in MessageListTableViewController.o   objc-class-ref in ChatViewController.o   objc-class-ref in EndUserAgreementViewController.o   objc-class-ref in ProfileViewController.o   objc-class-ref in MapsViewController.o   "_OBJC_METACLASS_$_Firebase", referenced from:   _OBJC_METACLASS_$_TEDFirebase in TEDFirebase.o ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>  <p>These errors did not exist prior to the update. I am using Cocoapods to add the framework to the project. I've been searching online for a few hours trying every trick in the book (changing lot of build settings, "other linker flags", "framework search paths", "library search paths", etc.). I've looked at most every answer on Stack Overflow, but none of them resolve the issue. I'm thinking that this issue is purely with Firebase, but I'm not entirely sure. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>If it helps, I am using Xcode 7.0 and my build target is iOS 8.3.</p>
