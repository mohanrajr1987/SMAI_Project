<p>This is code I clone <a href="https://github.com/firebase/firefeed" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/firebase/firefeed</a> I haven't modified at all. I'm getting this error when I try to login with Facebook. </p>  <p>"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"</p>  <p>When I look at Chrome Dev Tools the error is in obfuscated code so it's hard to understand what's going on. I can't figure out what function called the function in the obfuscated code. </p>  <p>This person had the same issue: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/firebase-talk/firefeed/firebase-talk/ws4CaMi33PM/Ti00_qWVjOgJ" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/firebase-talk/firefeed/firebase-talk/ws4CaMi33PM/Ti00_qWVjOgJ</a></p>  <p>However I am running the app on a server and it's still not working.
