<p>How would I go about implementing a full audit trail for users interacting with a firebase database? </p>  <p>I would need to comply with guidelines for medical records i.e. reference identity of user, authorizations schema, action (c/r/u/d), subject of action.</p>  <p>Based on feedback so far options are logging from the client or setting up a service that listens for changes.</p>  <p>However the client can be tampered with and a service listening for changes would miss the reads.</p>  <p>Ideally I would like to use the .write and .read rules because there I have the auth token payload and ruledatasnapshots. As far as I can gather you can only return a boolean and not perform any database interactions in the rules file.</p>
