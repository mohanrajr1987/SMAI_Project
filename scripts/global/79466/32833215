<p>I'm building a small web app (blog post alike) using AngularJs and Firebase. i implemented the addPost controller earlier and it worked good.  After i wanted to add some input file inside the form which already implemented to upload images to firebase on form submit using ng-file-upload directive . As a new in angular i knew that firebase can save images as base64 , so i found a function on the directive which can convert the images to base64 , but i got this error **ReferenceError: disallowObjectUrl is not defined     at Scope.$scope.upload ** when i try to submit the form .  i dont know what i'm doing wrong . here is the project on github  <a href="https://github.com/SaidThaher/HotelApp" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SaidThaher/HotelApp</a> The working files is addPost.html and addPost.js . all the app files is in app folder.</p>  <p>Please help,, i spent 3 days in this.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> </p>  <p>Update : @danialfarid updated the directive and made my day :)</p>  <p>Upgrade to 8.0.6 and move your fb push here:</p>  <pre><code>Upload.base64DataUrl(files).then(function(base64Urls) {   fb.push({...             images : base64Urls,         },... }); </code></pre>
