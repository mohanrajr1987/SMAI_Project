<p>I have data somewhat structured like below in Firebase. There is users having a list of groups they have access to. I wonder how I make a Firebase query only fetching the groups with $refIds equal to the once within the "groups" section in users. This is a many-to-may relationship. I would simply like to make a list of the groups the user is a member of.</p>  <p>Is the only option to fetch them one by one or is there a better solution?</p>  <pre><code>users: {     "$uid": {         name: "John Doe",         groups: {             "$refId": true,             "$refId": true         }     },     "$uid": {         name: "Jane Doe",         groups: {             "$refId": true         }     } }, groups: {     "$refId": {         title: "Group 1"     },     "$refId": {         title: "Group 2"     } } </code></pre>
