<p>I made a simple Angular + Firebase app, which you can <a href="https://bookmark-it.firebaseapp.com" rel="nofollow">see here.</a></p>  <p>I want to add user authentication to it using Firebase, and have successfully been able to create an account and login using Firebase's email and password auth.</p>  <p>The problem is, I don't know how to take the next step to separate each user's data â€” I want each user to only to be able to change their own data, and show nothing until they're logged in.</p>  <p>The only thing I could think of was to change the firebase URL I'm using to separate the FirebaseArrays I'm using, but that seems super hacky and didn't work when I tried it.</p>  <p>How am I supposed to use the unique uids to create separate, individual user data?</p>
