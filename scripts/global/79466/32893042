<p>I am a newbie with firebase and am trying to translate a simple "loadData" Button with Angularjs with a Firebase source instead of $http.get call in order to test my data source.</p>  <p>Basically I am trying to create something like this:<a href="https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2013/12/12/angularjspart-4-accessing-server-side-resources/" rel="nofollow">onclick Load data</a> to pull data from JSON Firebase DM. However I am running into lost in translation issues, especially as I am doing this in a bigger project which already loads controllers in one big file:</p>  <pre><code>controllersModule.controller('BlogCtrl', ["$scope", "$firebaseArray",   function($scope, $firebaseArray) {   var ref = new Firebase("https:&lt;DATASOURCE&gt;.firebaseio.com/");    //Nothing Happens   $scope.loadPosts = function(){   $scope.Posts = $firebaseArray(ref); }   //This Prints in The Console   ref.on("value", function(snapshot) {     console.log(snapshot.val());   },     function (errorObject) {       console.log("The read failed: " + errorObject.code);     }); }]); </code></pre>  <p>The scope does not give me much clue except for the following:     <code>TypeError: $firebaseArray(...).success is not a function</code> And I do have my dependencies in the page including angular ire and firebase as well as par of my angular app (all in separate files). The Posts.html view contains the following:</p>  <pre><code> //EDITED: Added an ng-repeat for posts  &lt;button ng-click="loadPosts()"&gt;Load Posts&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;div ng-repeat="post in Posts"&gt;     &lt;h3&gt;{{post.Title}}&lt;/h3&gt;     &lt;p&gt;{{post.Body}}&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The State provider builds my controller and pushes it inside ng-view in the index page:</p>  <pre><code> .state('Blog', {     url: '/blog',     controller: 'BlogCtrl as posts',     templateUrl: 'Posts.html',     title: 'Blog'   }) </code></pre>  <p>My guess is that I am making some wrong reference calls with my function above but do not know how to replace them with the firebase equivalent. Can anyone help?</p>
