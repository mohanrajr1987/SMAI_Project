<p>I'm making a web app using angularfire. I have a url for users at 'url.firebaseio.com/users'. I want to make another url to store chat-room type things at 'url.firebaseio.com/rooms'. When I create a new user using the $createUser() method, it stores the user's information under a unique ID created by $createUser() in the '/users' url. I want to do this with the new '/rooms' url, but I can't find a way to generate unique IDs in the same way without $createUser(). I can't use $createUser() because it requires an email address argument, and I just want to take in a name for the room and a password, all in an object under the unique ID for the room. </p>  <p>I can't think of any code to provide, so here's what a user looks like:</p>  <pre><code>users: {    uniqueUserId: {       email: email@email.com,       name: name    } } </code></pre>  <p>And here's what I'd like a 'room' to look like:</p>  <pre><code>rooms: {     uniqueRoomId: {         roomName: something     } } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a built-in way to do this? If not would it be best to generate IDs on my own?</p>
