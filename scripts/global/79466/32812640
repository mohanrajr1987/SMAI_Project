<p>I am trying to update Firebase using the <a href="https://github.com/ozgur/python-firebase" rel="nofollow">python-firebase</a> library, but cannot get authentication to work, using adapted sample code:</p>  <pre><code>from firebase import firebase as fb auth = fb.FirebaseAuthentication('&lt;firebase secret&gt;', 'me@gmail.com',                                   auth_payload={'uid': '&lt;uid&gt;'}) // NB renamed extras -&gt; auth_payload, id -&gt; uid here firebase = fb.FirebaseApplication('https://&lt;url&gt;.firebaseio.com', authentication=auth) result = firebase.get('/users', name=None, connection=None,                        params={'print': 'pretty'}) // HTTPError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized print result  </code></pre>  <p>I keep getting (401) Unauthorized, but I notice that the token generated by the library is radically different to one generated by a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/katowulf/D4YL8/light/" rel="nofollow">JavaScript version of FirebaseTokenGenerator</a> - and the latter authenticates fine when I provide the same URL, uid and secret.</p>  <p>I noticed a <a href="https://github.com/ozgur/python-firebase/issues/30" rel="nofollow">GitHub issue</a>, questioning why the library did not just use the <a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebase-token-generator-python" rel="nofollow">official Python firebase-token-generator</a>, so I <a href="https://github.com/moconnell/python-firebase/tree/use-firebase-token-generator" rel="nofollow">forked</a> and implemented the suggested change just in case it would make a difference, but still get the same result.</p>  <p>Can anyone suggest what might be tripping me up here?</p>
