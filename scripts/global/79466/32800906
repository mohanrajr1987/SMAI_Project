<p>I'm looking for a best practice on handling users within Firebase. I'm allowing users to log-in to my app using either Google+ or a (self defined) mail + password combination. I'm making use of the Firebase authorization mechanism for this (same style as shown in the login example: <a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebase-login-demo-android" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/firebase/firebase-login-demo-android</a>)</p>  <p>I'm storing a user object for each user having the auth.uid as a key. This user object contains the full mail address of the user.</p>  <p>I'm looking for the best way to prevent the same user logging-in to my app with both Google+ and mail/password. This will now result in having 2 user objects (1 with the uid for the Google+ account and 1 with the uid for the mail account) that both have the same mail address.</p>
