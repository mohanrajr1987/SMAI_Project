<p>One of these days where one bug follows the other jeezzz... So much for using firebase as an easy data source for my apps. I was just about to start implementing <code>$firebaseSimpleLogin</code> when it broke and I found out though stackoverflow that it was deprecated in favour of <code>$firebaseAuth</code>. However, now I am unable to update the function in the controller because it throws the same error time and time again:</p>  <p>TypeError: ref.$authWithPassword is not a function</p>  <p>I have added all the dependencies to my controller, created the ref object from my firebase source and the thing still won't allow my user (already created) to log i. Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>controllersModule.controller('HomeCtrl',  ["$scope", "$firebaseAuth",   function($scope, $firebaseAuth) {     var ref = new Firebase("https://&lt;MYUSERAPI&gt;.firebaseio.com");      var auth = $firebaseAuth(ref);    $scope.user = {};   $scope.SignIn = function(e){      e.preventDefault();      var username = $scope.user.email;      var password = $scope.user.password; </code></pre>  <p>//AMENDED - Still Getting an error           auth.$login('password', {                 email: username,                 password: password             })                 .then(function(user) {                     //Success callback                     console.log('Authentication successful');                 }, function(error) {                     //Failure callback                     console.log('Authentication failure');                 });       }     }]);</p>  <p>It tells me the at ref.$authWithPassword is not a function? Am I missing a plugin?</p>  <p>I have the following versions of firebase and Angular fire:</p>  <pre><code>          &lt;script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.2.4/firebase.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;           &lt;script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/angularfire/1.1.3/angularfire.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have gone onto this page <code>https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/password.html</code> but cannot recreate their options with my login/password version in angular.</p>  <p>Any help with be much appreciated, today especially. Thanks.</p>
