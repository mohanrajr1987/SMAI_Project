<p>I have been testing some apps and recently I've tried to do something similar to Twitter. I have a Feed where the most popular posts worldwide will be displayed. I don't want those posts to be the ones with the highest number of likes, but the ones that are the most popular: many increasing likes in a short period of time, the trending ones. I am using Firebase as a backend. How can I be able to get these "popular posts"?</p>
