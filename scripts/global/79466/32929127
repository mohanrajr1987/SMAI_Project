<p>As the title says, I'm trying to post a comment into a specific user status. So far, I can post comments and save them into firebase but those comments are displayed in all the statuses and of course it's because they are not referenced to that specific user status. </p>  <p>How can I achieve that?</p>  <p>Someone told me that each comment should have a property with the ID of the status or user to be able to make the query. But that's that I dont know how to do.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
