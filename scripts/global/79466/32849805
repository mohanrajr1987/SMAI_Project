<p>I store my data on Firebase with the format</p>  <pre><code>{   "list": [     "id created by Firebase": {       "foo": "bar"     },     "another id created by Firebase": {       "foo": "bar"     },     ...   ] } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to create an index on <code>foo</code>, using Firebase Rules.  However, according to Firebase doc, I need to know the specific ID created by Firebase to put in the rules specification.  Does anyone know of a way to get around this?</p>
