<p>I have angular JS application that gets data from REST service with sql server backend. I develop and have control on all 3 parts - angular app, rest service and database. </p>  <p>I want to now add pizazz by making this app near real time by using Firebase. My question is - can I keep my current rest service and database for the most part and only use Firebase database and the library minimally and only where necessary to support real time?</p>
