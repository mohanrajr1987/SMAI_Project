<p>I'm trying to add something to rooms/users using a data model that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>rooms: {     name: roomname     users: {         0: email@email.com     } } </code></pre>  <p>My question is if there is any way to append a new item to the users array. I would normally do this using update(), but update() requires a key for the data to be set to when I just want to set it to the next array index. I figure that I can do this by getting the current rooms/users array, appending to it locally, and using set() to overwrite it, but I was wondering if there was a better (built in) way to go about this.</p>
