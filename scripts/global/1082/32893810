<p>I looked around for my problem, and i couldn't find an answer, so here I go:</p>  <p>I have a JLayeredPane, and in there there are 2 JPanels. The deepest one ( furthest down ) has JButtons on there. The second one ( The one on top ) has a partially transparent background color ( although i don't think this should influence it ).</p>  <p>Now when I hover over my JButtons ( which are behind the other JPanel ), they still fire events to the MouseListener I added to them. I don't know why...</p>  <p>Why is this the case? What can I do to make it stop?</p>  <p>Here I add both the panels to the layered pane, and this refers to my class which extends a JFrame.</p>  <pre><code>    JLayeredPane layer = this.getLayeredPane();     layer.removeAll();      this.gamePanel = new GamePanel(game);       this.ghostPanel = new GhostPanel();     this.ghostPanel.setOpaque(true);     this.ghostPanel.setVisible(true);      layer.add(this.gamePanel, new Integer(0));     layer.add(this.ghostPanel, new Integer(1)); </code></pre>  <p>Here I have some buttons ( with an absolute layout ) added to the lowest panel</p>  <pre><code>    this.setLayout(null);     for (int j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {         for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5 + j; i++) {             this.add(this.buttons[i][j]);         }     }     for (int j = 1; j &lt; 5; j++) {         for (int i = j; i &lt; 9; i++) {             this.add(this.buttons[i][4 + j]);         }     } </code></pre>  <p>Here this refers to the most bottom JPanel</p>  <p>The purpose of this is a game called gipf, and the layout I went with is absolute because it was very hard to align everything in a hexagonal shape.</p>
