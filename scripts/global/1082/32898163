<p>I would like to begin working on a very simple game in java. However, I am having trouble getting images or colors/shapes to display. This is my code so far, however not sure how I can implement colors/add images to this? I have been looking up tutorials and examples however I am really confused about what the best way to go about adding images/colors to this code would be. </p>  <p>import java.awt.*; import javax.swing.JFrame;</p>  <p>public class Game extends JFrame {</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {     Game game = new Game();     game.run(); }  // Run the game void run() {      boolean isRunning = true; // Wether or not that game is running      init();     while (isRunning) {         update();         draw();     } }   // Called once when game is initialized void init() {     JFrame frame = new JFrame("ZZZ trap masta");     frame.setSize(300, 200);     frame.setVisible(true); </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <pre><code>// Called every frame update  void update() {     //System.out.println("update!");     }  // Update canvas void draw() {  } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
