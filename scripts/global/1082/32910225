<p>I am writing a small card game and so far i have the following :</p>  <ul> <li><p>I have a custom JPanel Card component where i override the getPreferredSize() method</p></li> <li><p>I also have a custom HandView component which essentially just adds a bunch of card components to it. I also override the getPreferredSize() and use a flowlayout.</p></li> </ul>  <p>My problem is when too many Card components are added to the handView they are not shown. I do not want the card components and the hand component to resize . What i would like is to make the card components start overlapping each other when too many are added. Is that possible with a flowlayout?</p>
