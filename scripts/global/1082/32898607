<p>My Question is how do I refresh the console?  I'm in Eclipse if that matters. my Console just ends up printing the gameboard over and over again and thus it gets about 500 gameboards right next to each other.  I have seen some answers where it says to just new line to create the appearance of a cleared screen.  I don't really like this answer though, so if you have another option please help me out on this.  Brand new Programmer here so if my code is excessively bad, that's why.  Any other options would be highly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>while(true) { // Main loop PrintArray(gameboard); if (IsKeyPressed.isWPressed()) {        System.out.println("Yo this worked");             } repaint(); </code></pre>
