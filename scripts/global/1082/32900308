<p>hello guys i just want to ask a question again, so im trying to make a POS system right now my problem is that, I want to make my jtable add the same items in a single row and add their quantity and adjust its price, for ex. product 1 already existed in the table and i want to add the same product 1 but with different quantity, and that additional product 1 will add its quantity to the previous product 1 that is already in the table and then adjust the price of the product 1.</p>  <p>hope i got myself clear, sorry for my bad english</p>
