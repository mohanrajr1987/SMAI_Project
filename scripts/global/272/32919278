<p>I am working on designing a batch oriented job to generate invoices in Microsoft excel format (HSSF/XSSF) and I need a way to create templates with conditional formatting. There are many different formats invoice layout based on business unit. I have used XSL and Apache FOP processor for generating PDF using SAXON wrappers.</p>  <p>I see XSL transformation for generating Xml based excel spreadsheet but not for HSSF.</p>  <p>I tried with Apache POI but can't seem to separate business logic and formatting info everything has to be placed in Java. I tried Apache cocoon but it seems overkill for batch.</p>  <p>I saw JEXCEL libraries but they doesn't seems to be stable and not much of documentation is available.</p>  <p>Please suggest.</p>  <p>Thanks  Ashish </p>
