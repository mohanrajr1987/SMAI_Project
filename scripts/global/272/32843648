<p>I am using a formatting engine in which previously I used the saxon9he.jar in which the configuration I got using "</p>  <pre><code>private static TransformerFactory theTransformerFactory =                          TransformerFactory.newInstance();  ((TransformerFactoryImpl) theTransformerFactory).getConfiguration(); </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to use <code>EnterpriseEdition</code> saxon9he.jar and I want to use <code>EnterpriseTransformerFactory</code> to get the configuration. Can I use this? or what are the changes I need to do for the <code>EnterpriseEdition</code> switch from Homedition in the engine?</p>
