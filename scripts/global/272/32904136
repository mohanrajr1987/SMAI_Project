<p>I would like to know how one could link in <code>xslt</code> file to a XML file which is in a directory inside PC. It is written in <code>xml</code> file as <code>href</code> as:</p>  <pre><code>..... &lt;description      href="/XML/file1.xml"&gt;                       &lt;description &gt;         &lt;![CDATA[file1.xml]]&gt;     &lt;/description&gt; &lt;/description&gt; ....... </code></pre>  <p>I want to create a table which in one column is the name of files and the name written in each row. Now by clicking the name the file should be opened.</p>  <p>TO be shorten, there is <code>href</code> in XML and refer a file which I want to by clicking it the file opens. That's all!</p>
