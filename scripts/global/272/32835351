<p>I have to generate PDF dynamically using C# code. The PDF is complex one and i want suggestion from best minds how to proceed and which way would be best.</p>  <p>Scenario: The PDF will be having lot of data and i have to loop through to genrate certain section of pdf for few logics.</p>  <p>Am having XML and XSLT to generate PDF by using C# and TallComponents pdfkit dll. The XML already coming to me is generated by other application and i have to add more xml nodes along with existing xml to satisfy my needs. </p>  <p>Since i have structral design probelm in partially generated PDF, i have to create html dynamically and then append html into already available XML. Then this xml is converted to pdf by applying xslt.</p>  <p>How to create Html dynamically is my big question now. I have already written code to convert Html to XML nodes and what i have mentioned is good way to go?</p>
