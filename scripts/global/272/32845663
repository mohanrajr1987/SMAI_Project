<p>I would like to create an xslt stylesheet to convert (simple) html to DOCBOOK (which will then be converted PDF via FO). All the basic formatting stuff works well. Now I want to have colors in the text. The HTML code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;span style="color: #eag000;"&gt;colored text&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;font color="#eag000"&gt;more colored text&lt;/font&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I've found some threads proposing to use</p>  <pre><code>&lt;emphasis role="red"&gt;colored text&lt;/emphasis&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>in DOCBOOK, but the colors I've got are not just "red", but some random hex values. </p>  <p>What is the best way to get colored text in DOCBOOK (so that it's recognized by the later FO transformation)? Is it possible at all to achieve this, without modifying the DOCBOOK-to-FO transformation? </p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
