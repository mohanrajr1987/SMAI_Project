<p>I need to transform source XML files to PDF documents but I don't know what solution is the best for me. </p>  <p>I found that the first way is Apache FOP and using XSLT file with XSL-FO language to format it. This technology is older and XSL-FO code seems to be a little complex. Is it worth using it today?</p>  <p>Based on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10641667/use-of-xsl-fo-css3-instead-of-css2-to-create-paginated-documents-like-pdf">this discussion</a> I found that I can use CSS3 to style it. I am little confused how to work with it. Need I generate HTML with CSS3 styles instead of XML-FO code?</p>  <p>The next problem is that I have LaTeX equations in my source XML files and it needs to be rendered in PDF file. Is that possible?</p>  <p>What do you recommend? I am looking for free solution. Thank you.</p>
