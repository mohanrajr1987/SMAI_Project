<p>I have a curl command I would like to execute in a for loop. For example I wanted to loop 1-100 times and when curl command runs it uses iterator variable value in the curl command itself. something like </p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash   for i in {1..10}  do     curl -s -k 'GET' -H 'header info' -b 'stuff' 'http://example.com/id=$i'          done  --notice here I want var i to be changing with every curl. </code></pre>  <p>Anything helps Thanks. </p>
