<p>Trying to get the following script:</p>  <pre><code>class MyClass {   static void main(String... args) {     println "Hello ${args[0]}"   } } </code></pre>  <p>To run like Java with: <code>java MyTest John</code> for example.</p>  <p>Reading <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/structure.html#_public_static_void_main_vs_script" rel="nofollow">the groovy docs on scripts with main</a> I was under the impression I could to the following to achieve my goal:</p>  <ol> <li>Run <code>groovyc MyTest.groovy</code></li> <li>Run <code>java MyTest John</code></li> </ol>  <p>I was even under the impression that I could leave just the body of the main function and still be able to compile until a class that extends from <code>Script</code>...</p>  <p>I can run the script with <code>groovy MyTest.groovy John</code> and (after compiling with <code>groovyc</code>) <code>groovy MyTest John</code></p>  <p>How can I accomplish my goal? What am I doing wrong?</p>
