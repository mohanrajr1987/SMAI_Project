<p>So, I've been scratching my head at this for a while, seeing as how I've got no experience working with PHP and file...anything.  The functionality I'm looking for is to parse a JSON array into PHP from a mixed format file (in this specific case, a WoT replay file), so that I can output some information.  pastebin due to size: <a href="http://pastebin.com/4vtqyBNr" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/4vtqyBNr</a></p>  <p>That's missing most of the file (the rest being data from the program itself), however there are { } and [ ] mixed into the rest of the files data as well.</p>  <p>Question being:  How do I pull the Json array, and only the Json array out of the file?</p>
