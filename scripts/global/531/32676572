<p>I have a bash script that uses ffmpeg inside it. I want to be able to pass <em>my</em> script a parameter that, if set, adds a parameter to the ffmpeg command inside my script.</p>  <p>At it's most basic, this is what I'm trying to do:</p>  <pre><code>ffmpeg \ # if duration flag is set for my script # -t $DURATION \ # end if # -rest of ffmpeg parameters... </code></pre>  <p>I know I could wrap the whole thing in an <code>if</code>, but the ffmpeg command has a lot of other parameters that would then need to be kept updated in two places.</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>
