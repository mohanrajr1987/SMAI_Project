<p>I have data set up in the following structure</p>  <pre><code>  A ,B ,C ,D ,E 1 a1,b1,c1,d1,e1 2 a2,b2,c2,d2,e2 3 a3,b3,c3,d3,e3 4 a4,b4,c4,d4,e4 </code></pre>  <p>And I'd like to take x fields from each row under column E such that the following affect can happen</p>  <pre><code>  A ,B ,C ,D ,E 1 a1,b1,c1,d1,e1,e2,e3 2 a2,b2,c2,d2,e2,e3,e4 3 a3,b3,c3,d3,e3,e4,etc 4 a4,b4,c4,d4,e4,etc,etc </code></pre>  <p>I just used etc, becaue I'd imagine the idea of what I'm trying to do would be put through.</p>  <p>Essentially transposing data only allows me to take a area of a column and turn it into a row, but I do not want to delete the data after transposing, I simply want to copy those area, But I have a large spread sheet(1500 rows currently and growing)</p>  <p>Though I'm using a spread sheet, this is simply a CSV and I'm comfortable using various scripting languages or programming languages if need be, I've considered C++,python,javascript and so on but am not sure what is the simplist way to achieve this goal.</p>
