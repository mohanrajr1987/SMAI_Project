<p>I am in the process of developing a script to change the password of an account through a Python script and all other modules except for the hash generation. </p>  <p>This is a working Python command to generate a hash against the password of choice with a random salt.</p>  <pre><code>python -c "import crypt,random,string; print crypt.crypt(raw_input('clear-text password: '), '\$1\$' + ''.join([random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits) for _ in range(16)]))" </code></pre>  <p>What I need is to convert it to be a Python function. Can anyone please convert it as a Python module for me. I tried a lot but for some reason the script is not giving the encrypted hash back. Any help is appreciated, thank you.</p>
