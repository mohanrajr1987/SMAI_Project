<p>I have a sheet which receives data inputted from a form. I want to send an email once the form data has gone to the form. In the the email I need to include data from a column I have manually added to the sheet (an archive number). </p>  <p>This is the script which works to send the email:</p>  <pre><code>function myFunction(e){ //Send email to advise of archive number var userName = e.values[1]; var archNum = e.values[11]; var subject = "New archive entry added by " + " " + userName + "Archive     Number " + archNum; var message = "Thank you, " + userName + ", you have created a new archive   entry " +archNum+ " please use this number when you add your data to the archive   area on the server"; MailApp.sendEmail (userName, subject, message); } </code></pre>  <p>The line in bold needs amending I think to extract the column data I have added to the response form.  </p>  <p>How do I call the entry from the spreadsheet that is not coming from the form?</p>
