<p>Suppose your script <code>do_both.sh</code> has a few long running commands:</p>  <pre><code>do_this do_that </code></pre>  <p>and, while <code>do_this</code> is still running, you edit <code>do_both.sh</code>:</p>  <pre><code>do_this do_something_else </code></pre>  <p>Would <code>do_that</code> get executed or <code>do_something_else</code>?</p>  <p>I experimented on CentOS, and got bash running <code>do_that</code>. I'm curious though whether that is a documented standardized behavior that one can count on. </p>
