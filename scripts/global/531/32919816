<p>Am in a need to develop script or service. As I don't have android programming knowledge, I have opted to write script for my requirement.</p>  <p>My Requirement: To read specific OTP from SMS\Text Message and copy to ClipBoard(seems android terminal doesn't have one). Which I need to use in any browser where my credential will be passed along with OTP.</p>  <p>What I have done so far: learnt few keywords to use sqlite to read OTP message and trim it to get only required characters from it. I am saving the OTP in csv file.</p>  <p>here it goes: with root privilages changed directory to</p>  <pre><code>root@myDevice:/ cd data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases </code></pre>  <p>where mmssms.db is present.</p>  <p>started sqlite3</p>  <pre><code>127|root@myDevice:/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases # sqlite3 SQLite version 3.8.6 2014-08-15 11:46:33  sqlite&gt; .open mmssms.db sqlite&gt; .mode csv sqlite&gt; .output otptext.csv sqlite&gt; select TRIM(body, 'Your temporary security code is.') from sms where read=0; </code></pre>  <p>with this my required code is created in csv file at the /data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases.</p>  <p>Now I am unable to copy the content to clipboard which I need further process.</p>  <p>Please help me to get this done.. Or if I can use any other approach to accomplish this..?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance..</p>
