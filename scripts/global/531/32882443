<p>I am new to JavaScripts, and I'm attempting to build a single page navigation blog using bootstrap. I have a basic <code>index.html</code> which has the following code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Some bootstrap navbar on top that includes "home", "about", "contact"&gt;  &lt;div id="content"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;script src="navigation.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The <code>navigation.js</code> file  has a window.addEventListener("hashchange", navigate) that just listens for the hashchange and sets the <code>innerHTML</code> of the content-div based on the hash. The actual content for each of the pages is seperated into partial html files, for example <code>about.html</code> that only has <code>&lt;p&gt;About&lt;/p&gt;</code> for now, and these partial htmls are fetched using AJAX.</p>  <p>So far everything works, but for the <code>home.html</code> I don't have only static HTML, i also want to execute a JavaScript that renders all the blog posts. Basically I would want <code>home.html</code> to include:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="posts"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script src="renderposts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>renderposts.js</code> is a script that sets the <code>innerHTML</code> of the posts-div to include all my blog posts.</p>  <p>This doesn't work though, <code>renderposts.js</code> is not executed. Am I thinking about this the wrong way and how should I approach this? The only work-around that I've managed is to include the code in the <code>navigation.js</code> file instead, and execute it with an if-statement checking if the location.hash is currently "#home". This is obviously a very ugly solution.</p>
