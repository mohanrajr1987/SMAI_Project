<p>Our server has been injected ... the virus creates php-files in different folders with different names. Then these files are loaded from external Hacking-Servers so that they generate and send Spam-Mails from our server ...</p>  <p>Because of getting on blacklists, i had to disable the mailfunction, because i can`t find out, where the injection comes/came from and how the files are generated. Deleting the files helps for a while, but then new ones are generated ...</p>  <p>We need the mailfunction in daily work and have no time to stop and repair it. So i need a solution that allows me to send mails from some specific files that i can define (maybe path included) anywhere while others (the ones that are generated) are blocked generally until there`s some freetime left ...</p>  <p>Hope you can help me out ... any other working solution is welcome as well !</p>
