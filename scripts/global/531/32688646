<p>I am a total novice at scripting, and need some help in curl scripting. I need to access a URL multiple times using CURL script in Windows command prompt, So that would need calling curl script multiple times. Is there any way to :  (A) access the URL request multiple times using single curl script,  (B) or a way in command prompt to call the single curl script multiple times?</p>
