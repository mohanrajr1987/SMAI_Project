<p>I'm trying to check that a list of servers all have valid PTR records.My issue is that to compare the list of servers afg Currently I have done the following:</p>  <pre><code>hostlist=$(echo /locationOfhostfile | awk 'BEGIN { FS=":" } ; { print $4 }' | xargs -i host {}) </code></pre>  <p>This returns all the servers in the following format (name.location.com is IPAddress and also any aliases they have). I then do a dig -x on the servers as follows:</p>  <pre><code>ptrrecords=$($(echo "$hostlist" | awk '{ print $3 }' | tr -d ',' | xargs -i dig +short -x {}) </code></pre>  <p>This returns just the names of the servers with valid PTR's. (name.location.com) I now want to compare the two lists so I've created 2 more variables to shorten both lists to only have the server name.</p>  <pre><code>finalhostlist=$(echo "$hostlist" | awk 'BEGIN { FS="." } ; { print $1 }') finalptrrecords=$(echo "$ptrlist" | awk 'BEGIN { FS="." } ; { print $1 }') </code></pre>  <p>My issue here when I compare the two variables is that 2 servers don't follow the normal naming convention (name.location.com) and as a result appear as <em>server is 10</em> as the first "." for that line is during the IP address. This issue takes place in the finalhostlist variable.  How can I make the field separator for $finalhostlist a full stop or a space?</p>  <p>Apologies for the long winded way I have asked this question.</p>
