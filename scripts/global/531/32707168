<p>I deal with pdfs a lot but when I try to download them it usually doesn't contain the actual title of the pdf/paper so I'll have to rename it most of the times, which I find is annoying.</p>  <p>In many cases URL doesn't have the title of the pdf, so I guess this has to be extracted by processing the content of the pdf. And it needs to be done on the client side, i.e., for e.g., as a browser plugin?  Is there a way that I can get the title when I'm downloading pdfs over the web via scripting or someting?</p>
