<p>I am trying to use sed replace a string that has a randomly generated alphanumeric. It is prefixed with a fixed word with special characters in it. </p>  <pre><code>{abcd}RandomAlphanumric </code></pre>  <p>I can easily replace the {abcd}, but I don't know how to replace the Random Alphanumeric without removing other words or data on the same line. I am able to accomplish exactly what I need with the following sed command, but this doesn't seem like a safe command to use in all cases. Is there a cleaner way to do this?</p>  <pre><code>sed -e 's/{abcd}.........../new_myvar/g' </code></pre>
