<p>I am trying to make a plugin for VLC Player using the Lua scripting language. </p>  <p>Assuming VLC is playing a local playlist, I would simply like to be able to detect when the player moves on to the next song and record, for example, how many songs have been played since the playlist was started.</p>  <p>My first impulse was to make an infinite loop that checks vlc.playlist.current() over and over, looking for a change versus last check, but I'm not having much luck (VLC hangs or crashes outright), the documentation is somewhat vague, and I'm fairly new to programming that is not (embedded) C.</p>  <p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Joel</p>
