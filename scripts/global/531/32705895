<p>I need to delete a registry entry based on its value. For example, the key will reside in:</p>  <pre><code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall </code></pre>  <p>The <code>DisplayName</code> key will contain <code>StackOverFlow</code>.</p>  <p>The names of these registry keys are GUID, therefore random, so I can't just search for them, the only way is the one above.</p>
