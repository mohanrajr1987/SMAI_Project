<p>I need to make a script for ACIS files manipulation, for example: </p>  <p>I have 1 SAT file exported from a CAD software with a 3D Model, and i want to create a script in some language (php, python, etc.. even .BAT if it works) that opens the SAT file delete all the components inside my 3D model. I just want the outside of the 3D model. </p>  <p>There is some way to do this? becuase i look to the SAT file and it's an ammount of text lines, maybe with a RFC and some tricky tools i can do this..</p>  <p>Any ideia?</p>  <p>Best Regards, Pedro Vieira</p>
