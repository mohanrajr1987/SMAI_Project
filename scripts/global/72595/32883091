<p>I am using viewPager for tabs in my application . I have 2 Tabs  and both tabs are making network call. As view pager inflate the both fragment in the starting so I created a interface and implemented in both fragment with a function onRefresh() which is basically doing the network call. Now issue which I am facing is, When I put my app in the background on 2nd tab and resume the application, it is calling the network api of first tab not the second tab.</p>  <p>I want the API of tab to be called which was visible when I put the app in the background.</p>  <p>Can any one tell me how can I achieve it?</p>
