<p>I am trying to generate a view pager swipe layout, where instead of a set of images, I want to use only one enlarged image. When users swipes, the layout should display portions of images from the single image. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ewIaC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ewIaC.png" alt="To be acheived view"></a></p>  <p>I know how to use view pager to show different images. But I need help with the above UI spec.</p>
