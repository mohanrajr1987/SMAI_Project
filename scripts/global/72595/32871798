<p>I want to implement a screen quite similar to the map view used in foursquare app version 2015.09.11.</p>  <p>So, there will be a list of cards / fragments that would be shown over the map towards the bottom of the screen. The card will be shown one at a time and would be horizontally scroll-able in order to watch the next card. On tapping or on sliding up gesture the card will slide up and more details would be shown.</p>  <p>I came across this <a href="https://github.com/dlukashev/AndroidSlidingUpPanel-foursquare-map-demo" rel="nofollow">this library</a> in one of the SO question. The library has wonderfully implemented the sliding up feature using <a href="https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" rel="nofollow">umano library</a>. This is probably the earlier view used in the foursquare.</p>  <p>I want to club the horizontally scroll-able cards along with this sliding up feature. I have implemented the horizontally scroll-able card / fragment one at a time using ViewPager. But i am stuck in adding the sliding up feature to it. Layout's xml i have used is below :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="match_parent" tools:context="com.example.MainActivity"&gt;  &lt;fragment xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"     xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="match_parent" android:id="@+id/map"     android:name="com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment" /&gt;  &lt;android.support.v4.view.ViewPager     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"     android:id="@+id/slider_pager"     android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="100dp"     android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>Please help me in providing a way through it. I would appreciate if anyone can tell how foursquare would have implemented this (by using ViewPager to show the card / fragment one at at time or using some other component).</p>  <p>P.S. I have recently started the android development.</p>
