<p>I'm using Viewpager and the Circle and Title view pager from <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ViewPagerIndicator" rel="nofollow">JakeWharton</a> The viewpager with the circle indicator is working fine, but while using the view pager with both circle and title indicator both indicators are not working. Here is a screenshow of the issue:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S5Sxj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S5Sxj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> So is it possible to use both indicators at the same time, and if so how can I do that? Also does anyone knows how can I style the title indicator? Right now it shows a blue line and no text..</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>adapter = new ContractsPagerAdapter(getActivity(), topContracts, selected);              pager.setAdapter(adapter);         indicator.setViewPager(pager);         titleIndicator.setTextColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.white));         titleIndicator.setViewPager(pager); </code></pre>
