<p>Java provides a Lock object in the concurrency package that according to the documentation <code>provides more extensive locking operations than can be obtained using synchronized methods and statements.</code></p>  <p>The synchronized methods/blocks besides mutual exclusion, enforce a happens-before relationship which makes sure that changed made to the variable by one thread are visible to the other.</p>  <p>Does this relationship occur when using a Lock object? Is observation guaranteed like in the case of synchronized block for all platforms?</p>
