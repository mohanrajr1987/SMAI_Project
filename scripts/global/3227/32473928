<p>I need help with understanding resultant behaviour of concurrent transactions updating same row of the database.</p>  <p>Database : MySQL</p>  <p>Scenario: 1) Transaction A will update row (1,2,3) 2) Transaction B will update row (1,3,4)</p>  <p>Since both transactions are executing in parallel, in auto-commit mode turned off, would the final state (for row 1 and 3) will reflect the changes made by both A and B or there is a potential for data loss.</p>  <p>Also would the answer change if the transactions are simply incrementing the data records?</p>
