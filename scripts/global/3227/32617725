<p>I have an Access database (.accdb) file that must be replaced with a backup copy.  Unfortunately, the file is locked with an (.laccdb) and I cannot rename or remove either file.</p>  <p>I don't exactly know who is locking the file and it could be contractors across the globe.  So I can't just ask everyone to disconnect.</p>  <p>How can I unlock, remove, or rename the locked .accdb file?</p>
