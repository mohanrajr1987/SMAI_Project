<p>I am trying to make a thread safe method. I have this code to test it.</p>  <pre><code>private static readonly Object objLock = new Object();      static void Main(string[] args)     {          // Create ten new threads.         for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)         {             ThreadStart start = new ThreadStart(LockTest);             new Thread(start).Start();         }          Console.Read();     }      public static void LockTest()     {         lock (objLock)         {             Thread.Sleep(1000);             Console.WriteLine(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(Environment.TickCount).Seconds.ToString());         }     } </code></pre>  <p>This works but what I would like to do is if the Lock is in place I  need the other threads to exit rather than wait and execute the code when the lock is freed. Is this possible? Thanks.</p>
