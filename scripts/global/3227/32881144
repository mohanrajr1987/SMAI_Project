<p>Write detailed pseudocode for a completely fair readers/writers lock (i.e., one in which pending readers execute before a newly arriving writer, and pending writers execute before a newly arriving reader, regardless of the current state of the lock). </p>  <p>You will need a <code>lock</code> datatype, a <code>node</code> datatype, and four methods (<code>read_acquire</code>, <code>read_release</code>, <code>write_acquire</code>, and <code>write_release</code>).</p>  <p>Hint: You should organize your nodes in a queue, with enqueue, dequeue, and peek_tail methods.</p>
