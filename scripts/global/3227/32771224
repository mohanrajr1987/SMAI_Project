<p>I have a system running on two JBoss instances. What I am trying to do is to lock a table manually, then do some data manipulation during which I have to do more than one commit and then unlock the table manually so that the second server could not manipulate the table while the first one is working with it. The problem is that on every commit the database releases the lock.  Does anyone know how to achieve that - preferably with hibernate?</p>
