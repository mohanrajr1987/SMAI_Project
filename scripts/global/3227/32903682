<p>I have two tables.  Let's call one, <strong>Released</strong> and the other <strong>Previous</strong>. All updates are done on the Released table in real time, as and when they occur, through out the day. </p>  <p>The Previous table is basically an archive of older records in the Released table. That means, I intend to copy data older than a <strong>period</strong> in Released to Previous and then delete those records from Released. </p>  <p>If I were to write a SQL Server job to move older data from the Released to the Previous table, what sort of locks would be involved? Would such a process slow down writes to the Released table? If it does then how do I minimize such a negative impact? </p>  <p>PS: All updates to Released are done by the application code, via entity framework. I've worked with other Relational databases, but I'm new to SQL Server. So I've gone through <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa213039%28v=sql.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa213039%28v=sql.80%29.aspx</a> to get an idea of the types of locks in SQL Server.</p>
