<p>I have a method called processOutbox. I want it to be thread safe. I don't want another thread to call this method while one thread is at it. I have implemented it the following way. Have I done it correctly? Are there any loopholes in my implementation? If there are any, then please advice on how I can resolve it.</p>  <pre><code>this.start();     outboxLock.lock();     timer = new Timer();     try{     timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(new TimerTask() {             public void run() {                processOutbox();             }         }, 0, period);     } finally{         outboxLock.unlock();     } </code></pre>
