<p>I am trying to implement thread safe <code>ArrayList</code> Collection,</p>  <p>I want my collection should put lock at an item level instead of on complete collection.</p>  <p>Let say if my collection has 10 items, so 10 threads can update value simultaneously from index 1 to 10,  Since they are update different array item , so it should be allowed. Here update doesn't include removing an item from <code>ArrayList</code></p>  <p>I don't want use in built concurrent collections, because of addition overhead.</p>  <p>Is there any locking mechanism available to put lock on individual  item of <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
