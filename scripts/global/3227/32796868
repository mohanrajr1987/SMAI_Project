<p>I was just trying to understand optimistic and pessimistic locking mechanisms and came across the definition of them at <a href="http://Locking%20-%20Wiki" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(database)</a></p>  <p>If I try to relate the concepts to java instead of a database, am I right in saying that a synchronized usage is always pessimistic and a CAS (<code>AtomicInteger</code> and other classes) usage is always optimistic?</p>
