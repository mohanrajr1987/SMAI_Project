<p>Is there a way to synchronize access to each element in an allocated memory. For example, if I allocate memory using the following code </p>  <pre><code>int* counters = new int[10]; </code></pre>  <p>is there a way to synchronize modification of each counter separately (being able to modify counters[0], counters[1]...counters[9] at the same time) so that modification of, let's say, counters[0] won't block counters[9] until the lock is released to update counters[9] and the other counters while a thread is updating a specific counter, counters[0]? The counters aren't related and don't depend on any shared data with the other counters?</p>
