<p>I am new to android, In my app I just need to add a screen like pattern lock, what exactly I want to do is, no need to create/ set a pattern.Just design a screen with 9 dots, and when user draw some pattern and I need to get those pattern value.For design I used PatternView but how can I get the user drawer pattern? I already google on this, but I found there they setting the pattern lock, I don't want that.I just want is when I draw something on PatternView it just return the value like,suppose like if I draw a pattern like 2365 dots it will return an integer value like 2365.</p>
