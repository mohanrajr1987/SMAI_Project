Can anyone spot why the <code>System.IO.File.Delete(directoryFile.FullName)</code> is not allowing me access to this text file for deletion, and how i can unlock it to delete? Is it the for each that is locking my file?  I need to delete the file within the loop, so if the for loop is locking me, what are the work-arounds here?</p>  <p>Additionally, i tested the delete by removing the entire writer block and 2 declared variables above it, and the file still had a lock. This can help to isolate the issue to the surrounding logic and not the <code>streamWriter</code> portion.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
