<p>In this example:</p>  <pre><code>private ReentrantReadWriteLock mLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();  public void method(boolean condition) {     try {         mLock.writelock.lock()          if (condition) {             mLock.writelock.unlock();         }     } finally {         mLock.writelock.unlock();     } } </code></pre>  <p>What happens when <code>mLock.writelock.unlock()</code> is called in the <code>finally</code> block if the unlock in the <code>if</code> statement has been executed?</p>  <p>Is this code safe or do I need to perform some check on whether there is a lock in place before attempting to unlock?</p>
