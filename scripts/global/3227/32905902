<p>I was wondering why I would need to use lock mode page on a table.</p>  <p>Recently I came up to a pretty good case of why not. While I was trying to insert a row on a table I got a deadlock. After lots of investigation I figured out the the lock level of my table was Page and this was the actual reason that lead to the deadlock.</p>  <p>My guess is that this is a common scenario on large scale high performance environments with multiple applications hitting the same db</p>  <p>The only thing I found is that I should use page locking if I am processing rows in the same order as the paging occurs. This looks like a weak condition that can seldom be met (especially for scaling which could render this case obsolete).</p>  <p>I can see why one would lock a full table or use per row locking but the Page locking does not make much sense. Or does it?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
