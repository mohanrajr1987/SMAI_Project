<p>I lost my very important file in a folder.</p>  <p>I was using the software 'folder lock' version 2 and my folder was locked. I was unable to unlock it any other way, so I removed that folder in folder lock again. I could still not open the folder, so I uninstalled folder lock. But even after that, I could not open my folder. Its size is shown as empty and the folder can not be copied, deleted, renamed or removed. So what can I do to open my folder?</p>  <p>When i open it show error like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>G://pooja imp.{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}not accessible.</p>      <p>The process can not access the file because it is being used by another process.</p> </blockquote>
