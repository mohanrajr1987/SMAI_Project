<p>I am trying to stream data stored on Amazon S3 to a client. Unfortunately, I am unable to redirect to the bucket with a presigned URL in order to support such files as HTML which require the original HTML file to be served from the same domain as its assets (css, etc..). </p>  <p>After reading <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Base/render" rel="nofollow">http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Base/render</a></p>  <p>It seemed to me as though I should be able to do the following:</p>  <pre><code> render :text =&gt; proc { |response, output|    s3_object.get(response_target: output)  end </code></pre>  <p>However, the output of this on the page was just the result of <code>proc.to_s</code></p>  <p>Similarly, the example provided in the Rails docs:</p>  <pre><code> render :text =&gt; proc { |response, output|     100.times do |i|       output.write("This is line #{i}\n")     end   } </code></pre>  <p>Seems to do the same.</p>  <p>Has anyone run into this problem? Is there a reason why Rails is not properly rendering the results of the lambda instead of calling .to_s?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
