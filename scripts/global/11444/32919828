<p>I feel like this should be a lot easier than it's been on me. </p>  <pre><code>copy tracks_artists from 's3://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/filename.csv' CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=my-access;aws_secret_access_key=my-secret' REGION 'us-west-1'; </code></pre>  <p>Note I added the REGION section after having a problem but did nothing. </p>  <p>Where I am confused though is that in the bucket properties there is only the <a href="https://path/to/the/file.csv" rel="nofollow">https://path/to/the/file.csv</a>. I can only assume that all the documentation that I have read calling for the path to start with s3://... that I would just change https to s3 like shown in my example. </p>  <p>However I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>"Error : ERROR:  S3ServiceException: The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint.  Please send all future requests to this endpoint.,Status 301,Error PermanentRedirect,Rid" </code></pre>  <p>I am using navicat for PostgreSQL to connect to Redshift and Im running on a mac.</p>
