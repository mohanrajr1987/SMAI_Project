<p>We have images stored in the AWS S3 for our production services.<br> Is there any API which will allow to enable encryption on these existing resources without downloading and uploading again? </p>  <p>I see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1464961/how-to-clone-a-key-in-amazon-s3-using-python-and-boto">Boto module</a> in Python allows to clone the key with additional parameters e.g encryption, but this will create a new key. As these keys are stored in a separate database, we want to retain existing keys but just enable encryption.</p>
