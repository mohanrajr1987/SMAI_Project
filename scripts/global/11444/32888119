<p>We upload objects via signed cloudfront url. The objects are only accessible via cloudfront Web but NOT via RTMP or S3.</p>  <p>If I browse to the S3 location via the AWS Admin Console, and look at the permission for the objects, it is simply empty.</p>  <p>We have tried adding the header x-amz-content-sha256 with a value of the SHA256 of the content, while the file upload fine, we still cannot access the file by any other means than CF Web again...</p>  <p>Anyone know how to fix this?</p>
