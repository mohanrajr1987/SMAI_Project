<p>So what's super weird is I have followed an innumerable amount of guides on this topic.</p>  <p>I have tried the allows other option, I've tried modifying directory owner and permissions.</p>  <p>I feel like I've tried everything. But the files show up when mounted, but are not writeable via vim or any other editor. The permissions are 755 and owned by the user mounting them, but still not writeable.</p>  <p>This is the most recent S3FS on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</p>
