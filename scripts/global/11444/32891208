<p>I am wondering what happens to background task after device reboot? Is there a way to make the system restart unfinished tasks once the device reboots? </p>  <p>Reading online I couldn't find a definite answer. I found people talking about making the application use VoIP or location updates backgrounding, this isn't really what I want.</p>  <p>I just want to make sure all my background tasks, which include uploading files to the server, be finished even after reboot. By finished I mean all files are uploaded as expected.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>I want to use AWSS3GetPreSignedURLRequest to do my uploads in the background as AWS documentation (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/s3transfermanager.html#use-pre-signed-urls-to-transfer-objects-in-the-background" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/s3transfermanager.html#use-pre-signed-urls-to-transfer-objects-in-the-background</a>) explains. </p>  <p>So, I want to be sure that if there is a reboot, my task finish all the uploads as expected.</p>
