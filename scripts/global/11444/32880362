<p>My Amazon S3 bucket has a folder structure that looks like the below.</p>  <ul> <li>bucket-name\00001\file1.txt  </li> <li>bucket-name\00001\file2.jpg </li> <li>bucket-name\00002\file3.doc </li> <li>bucket-name\00001\file4.ppt</li> </ul>  <p>If I only know file name <strong>file3.doc</strong> and bucket name <strong>bucket-name</strong> how can i search for <strong>file3.doc</strong> in <strong>bucket-name</strong>. If I knew, it is in folder <strong>00002</strong>, I could simply go to the folder and start typing the file name but I have no way to know in which folder the file I am searching for is under.</p>
