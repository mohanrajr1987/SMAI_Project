<p>I'm trying to upload a file from client side(Backbone) to S3. I tried using the gem <a href="https://github.com/waynehoover/s3_direct_upload" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waynehoover/s3_direct_upload</a>. The problem is I already have a form and this gem's helper <code>s3_uploader</code> will also generate a from internally. Nested forms is not a valid one.</p>  <p>Can some one suggest me how to achieve this or any alternatives to achieve the same. </p>
