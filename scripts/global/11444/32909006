<p>I've managed to use webrtc to capture voice from the browser, MP3 encode client side, and stream over websocket to Ruby/Faye/Puma on heroku.  This is nice because there is no upload step after taking a long recording.</p>  <p>Now I want to stream to S3 as the recording is in progress.  You can't append to an S3 file but there are plenty of suggestions that you can send 5MB chunks, one-by-one, in a multipartupload. </p>  <p>I can't make sense of the docs or source for Aws-sdk-ruby V2.  It seems to want a whole file and to manage chunks under the hood.  </p>  <p>Any clues? </p>
