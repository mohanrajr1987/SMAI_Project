<p>I have elasticsearch running on a dev ubuntu EC2 instance.  I want to be able to use curator to take a snapshot of each day's logstash and store that snapshot in an S3 bucket.  Everything works, except the snapshots are HUGE relative to the logstashes.</p>  <p>For instance, according to du, the EC2's logstash-2015.09.01 directory is 3KB, but the snapshot for that index on S3 is 93KB.  For larger ones, it's even more pronounced: logstash of 164KB becomes a whopping 305MB on S3!  I've verified that there is only a single node using this snapshot.  </p>  <p>Is this great embiggening an expected behavior?  Any ideas on how to correct this?</p>
