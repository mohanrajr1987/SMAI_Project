<p>I need Travis-CI to deploy to 2 different buckets depending on the branch being built. Previously I had just prefixed the branch name onto the bucket, but that's not going to work with CNAMEs as the name needs to match the actual FQDN.</p>  <p>Anyway, so currently I only have one deploy sections pushing my master branch, my staging branch is currently being ignored, how do I resolve this?</p>  <p>For example.</p>  <hr>  <p>branch: staging</p>  <p>bucket: test.mydomiain.com</p>  <hr>  <p>branch: master</p>  <p>bucket: www.mydomain.com</p>  <hr>
