<p>I'm developing a photo sharing application with rails. Since the application will be focused on photo sharing, image upload time is important. From two points, a user shouldn't wait more than 3-4 seconds for an image upload and when hundreds of people are sharing photos at the same time, that shouldn't matter also.</p>  <p>A guy is talking about some good information for me <a href="http://aaronvb.com/articles/paperclip-amazon-s3-background-upload-using-starling-and-workling.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>For my situtation, if I basically use paperclip gem with AWS, that means every image will be queued and if many people are posting images, they would be wait for minutes... Also I have to take care about heroku timeout...</p>  <p>So is this true that AWS or Paperclip is not suitable for me, or what should I do to handle this?</p>
