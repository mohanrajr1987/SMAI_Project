<p>I'm attempting to build a cms using a s3 bucket as a website.  I have a bucket policy that allows public/anonymous access to all but the /_admin directory.  To gain backend access I want the user to be able to provide a username/password that will change the bucket policy to allow /_admin access based on the users ip address.</p>  <p>What is the best way to accomplish this?</p>  <p>*I'm thinking of using the API Gateway to call a Lambda function that checks the username/password and then changes the policy.  A successful result will then redirect to the backend.</p>
