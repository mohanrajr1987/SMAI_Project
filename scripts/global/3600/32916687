<p>I am trying to work with this example:</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/200eoamf/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/200eoamf/1/</a></p>  <p>that is the code in part, you can see all the code in jsfiddle:</p>  <pre><code>var onFileReadFn = $parse(attrs.onReadFile); var reader = new FileReader();  reader.onload = function() {      var fileContents = reader.result;      // invoke parsed function on scope     scope.$apply(function() {         onFileReadFn(scope, {             'contents' : fileContents         });     }); };  reader.readAsText(element[0].files[0]); </code></pre>  <p>The following issue occurs in <em>Chrome</em> browser, but not in <em>Firefox</em>:</p>  <p>If I choose file, say <strong>myfile.txt</strong>, it will appear in the text box. However, if I manually clear that window by selecting the entire text and deleting it, and then trying to upload the same file <strong>myfile.txt</strong> again, it won't upload. Why is this happening and how to fix it? Thanks.</p>
