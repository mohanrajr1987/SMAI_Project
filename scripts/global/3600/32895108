<p>I would like to use a chrome extension to fetch some data from my phone by bluetooth. And the data being retrieved depends on the DOM of the current web page. I found that Google has some chrome.bluetooth API, which means that Chrome is able to access the computer bluetooth. However, it seems that the API is only for Chrome apps, which is totally different from an extension. I am wondering if there is a ways for a chrome extension to establish a bluetooth connection? If not, is there any workaround?</p>
