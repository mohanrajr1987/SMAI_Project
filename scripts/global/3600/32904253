<p>I have a Win7 64bit machine for development with apache2.</p>  <p>I have some virtualhosts like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&gt;     ServerAdmin v.......@gmail.com     DocumentRoot "D:/Apache/htdocs/test/"     ServerName test.localhost     ErrorLog "logs/test.localhost-error.log"     CustomLog "logs/test.localhost-access.log" common &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;   &lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&gt;     ServerAdmin v.......@gmail.com     DocumentRoot "D:/Apache/htdocs/"     ServerName localhost     ErrorLog "logs/localhost-error.log"     CustomLog "logs/localhost-access.log" common &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>If I am using IE, Firefox or Safari, and type <a href="http://test.localhost/" rel="nofollow">http://test.localhost/</a> then everything is fine.</p>  <p>But when try it in Chrome or Opera, it shows the <code>D:/Apache/htdocs/index.html</code></p>  <p>It seems, for some reason the virtual hosts not works.</p>  <p>Of course, I tried to search for it on the net, and found this topic:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30467573/chrome-localhost-does-not-work">Chrome localhost does not work</a></p>  <p>Tried to modified the hosts file with the IPV6 version, tried to flush the DNS, restart machine, etc... nothing helped.</p>  <p>Is there any more suggestion for me?</p>
