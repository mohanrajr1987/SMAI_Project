<p>I've created a SCORM 2004 package and launched it in a SCORM LMS. The LMS opens the course up as a pop-up window and runs like it should on normal usage. </p>  <p>Problem comes when all data tracking are lost when some of our learners refresh their browsers midway while taking the course. All the quizzes and progress are not tracked when F5 or reload is clicked. </p>  <p>How do i fix this or is this a normal behavior in SCORM environment?</p>
