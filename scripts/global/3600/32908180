<p>Most web browsers provide keyboard shortcuts to interact with the DOM. <em>e.g.:</em></p>  <p><code>Tab</code> shifts the focus to the next focus-able element<br> <code>Alt + Tab</code> shifts the focus to the previous focus-able element<br> <code>Enter</code> activates the currently focused element</p>  <p>What I have now figured out is that many popular browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) don't apply the CSS <code>:active</code> pseudo-class if an element gets activated by pressing the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>  <p><strong>Why is this so?</strong></p>  <p>I think it is misleading because it looks like you don't trigger the buttons; although you actually do.</p>
