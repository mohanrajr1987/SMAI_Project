<p>I'm having an issue trying to create an HTML file that runs completely offline (except for loading in jQuery for the script).</p>  <p>The page allows the user to first select a state from the state select menu. This triggers an event in which all of the counties of a second select menu are looped through and the ones belonging to the selected state are shown, the others hidden.</p>  <p>In Google Chrome (the only browser I am concerned about at the moment) the last two states in my list (Oklahoma and Tennessee) correctly trigger the event and subsequently their inline style is changed to block from  none by jQuery. However, in Chrome I am unable to click on the county list and see the counties displayed. If I change the order in which the counties are ordered in the list, it is always the last two states that do not display their corresponding counties. If I comment out any two state's counties, then all state's counties that are  not commented are displayed.</p>  <p>All code is in a JSFiddle (less table bodies): <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/kb7mnyr1/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/kb7mnyr1/</a></p>  <p>Code to show counties (which is required for JSFiddle link):</p>  <pre><code>function changeCounty(state){         $countylist = $('#countySelect').find('option');         $countylist.hide();         $.each($countylist, function(i, val){         if($(val).attr('class') == state) $(val).show();     }); } </code></pre>
