<p>I started experiencing an issue with images not being displayed on my jssor carousel slider; this issue is only present on Chrome (latest Version 45.0.2454.101 m) - it works fine under Firefox, Explorer and mobile browsers.</p>  <p>Drilling down, it seems that user agent stylesheet adds/applies this element: transform: perspective(2000px); When in Chrome's Developer Tools, unchecking this style option results in image being displayed just fine.</p>  <p>Any help with explanation what is going on and how to deal with this issue is much appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you, Michael</p>
