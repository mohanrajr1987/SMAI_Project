<p>I am working on building a webapp, that loads large csv's, ~1 million rows by 15 columns, but when loading them in chrome and firefox either crash, freeze, or say they're out of memory.</p>  <p>Currently, I'm using PapaParse.js to load in the csv's and performing a few functions and then graphing with d3.js, but often times the browser stops working while I'm loading in data.</p>  <p>I've looked for memory leaks and it seems that number of dom elements is stable, so I don't think thats the problem, but I'm confused as to how to fix this.</p>  <p>Any advice on re-adjusting the browser settings, parsing the csv's differently, or similar issues would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
