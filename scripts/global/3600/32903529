<p>I have a frameset and want to change the window.location.hash of the frameset with js;</p>  <p>That works fine for IE and Firefox but the Chrome reloads the page;</p>  <p>I can't use pop and pushstate feature because i have to use the file Protocoll - > and so i run in the same origin policy.</p>  <p>Is there a chance to prevent the reloading of the frameset?</p>  <p>The Window.events unbeforeunload amd onhashchange didn't fire in Chrome when I change the hash in a frameset. Is there a other common way?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Felix</p>
