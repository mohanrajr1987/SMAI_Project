<p>I have found request in my logs coming from various browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome) with Do-Not-Track header enabled.</p>  <p>I suspect that these users have not enabled Do-Not-Track manually (because it not a popular and know user setting, in my opition) but rather that it's being enabled for them when they use each browser's "private mode".</p>  <p><strong>Does "private mode" on each browser enable Do-Not-Track?</strong></p>
