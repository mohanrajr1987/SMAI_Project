<p>I am trying to analyze the performance of my web-app with Chrome DevTools. So I was looking at timings under "Inspect Element" > "Network". While comparing localhost to the same page on the web, I noticed that the size of several .js-Files varied significantly, i.e. one minified .js was shown with 4.5kb on the web and 13.9kb on localhost. However, when I right-clicked these entries in nw-panel to "Save", I got identical files with 14kb. </p>  <p>So where do these variations come from?  <em>(BTW, Firefox shows that file also with14kb when access on the web!)</em></p>
