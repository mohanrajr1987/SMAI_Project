<p>I am doing some testing on a page and need to quickly disable java with keyboard shortcut. My problem is that the test involves popups on my screen in Chrome asking for confirmation, but if it were possible for me to disable javascript completely at will, then I can get past the constant trail of popups that come up on these test pages. Anyone know of a way? Maybe at the system level even? </p>
