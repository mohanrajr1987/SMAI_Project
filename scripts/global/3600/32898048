<p><br> just want to ask if anyone can acces every script in extension. <em>Content scrips</em> you can see in 'sources' in developers mode. <em>Background page/script</em> via extensions in settings, <em>popup.js</em> or any other script (linked in HTML) can be accessed via popup.html. <br> Can I somehow secure my algorithms against stealing? <br> Thanks in advance. Have a good day.</p>
