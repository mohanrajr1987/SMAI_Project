<p>Some Chrome extensions have bookmark icons that are automatically added to the bookmarks bar, but, so far as I can tell apps such as Postman can't be added directly to the shortcut bar.</p>  <p>If I want to launch an "app" (i.e. not one of the extensions which already show up in the toolbar) such as this, I have to open the "Apps" shortcut window, and then find the app (or launch it separately from the app launcher).</p>  <p>I would very much like to have a bookmark to a specific App in the bookmark bar. Is this possible?</p>
