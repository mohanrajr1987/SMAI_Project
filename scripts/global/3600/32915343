<p>I got these includes to work with angular offline but because of the ajax it only works in firefox. Is there a way to get this to work in any browser locally with no internet. This is a demo that non computer savvy people will have to use.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!-- Test --&gt; &lt;div ng-include src="'_includes/link.html'"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So the users will not know how to go to command prompt etc.</p>
