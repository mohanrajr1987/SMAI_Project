<p>My target browser is the latest version of Chrome (only!) so I want to use the latest technology to get the best performance/visuals etc...</p>  <p>I will be getting the initial (directed) graph and subsequent updates as JSON over a websocket and I want to be able to update the graph as I receive updates.</p>  <p>I've used D3 in the past but as I understand, that is Javascript/SVG, it seems a bit silly to use Javascript when I only have to target Chrome, so I am wondering if I should be looking at another technology/library?</p>
