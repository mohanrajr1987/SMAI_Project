<p>I have some code which I defined in the Chrome developer tools console:</p>  <pre><code>alert("I was just reloaded"); </code></pre>  <p>How can I have this code run everytime I reload the browser? </p>  <p>The code is only defined in the console, in Google Chrome in this particular case.</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong>, I don't want just the log to persist, I want the code to persist and to rerun everytime I reload the page.</p>
