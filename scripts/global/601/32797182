<p>CentOS release 6.7</p>  <p>Vanilla install, all I have really done is added to /etc/crontab 59 23 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily</p>  <p>inside /etc/cron.daily is svn.sh which has a single line /home/svn.sh 2>&amp;1| mail -s "blah" myemailaddy</p>  <p>The final script dumps the database and does a svn commit on the zipfile.</p>  <p>The bizarre thing is that it emails me at 5 minutes past midnight showing the database dump output and the svn commit.  Then 4 hours later it runs again for no reason I can understand.  Does it every day but what time later can vary (e.g. might be 3.5 hours later)</p>  <p>There is just a single instance of crond running.</p>  <p>What can I look for to troubleshoot this?</p>
