<p>I need to schedule a few tasks--using rufus-scheduler, I can send emails on a daily/weekly basis...but when I push to production, there are some execution issues for ol' rufus. </p>  <p>I'm not a wiz at deployment. How should one handle scheduling tasks and deployment? It seems like a troublesome task to troubleshoot, so I'm looking for best-practice and pointers as well as if you would recommend cron over some "automatic" gem.</p>
