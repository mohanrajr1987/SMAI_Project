<p>I'm having trouble executing a Ruby script with my Python code.</p>  <p>My server has a cron job that is supposed to execute a Python script and a Ruby script. However, the Ruby script has to be executed after the Python one, so I decided to add a line:</p>  <pre><code>os.system("ruby /home/username/helloworld.rb")  </code></pre>  <p>at the end of the Python script.</p>  <p>It runs, but I'm getting this error in the log file:</p>  <pre><code>/bin/sh 1: ruby not found </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure why this is happening; I've tried calling the exact same function in the Python console as well as running the Python script manually, and both work perfectly. In other words, this line of code doesn't work <em>ONLY</em> when the script is triggered by cron.</p>  <p>Is there something else I need to put in my crontab/Python script perhaps?</p>
