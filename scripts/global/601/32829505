<p>I have an R script that runs CasperJS through a "system" command and is scheduled through the "Scheduled Tasks" program on Ubuntu. If I hit the "Run selected task" button in Scheduled Tasks, the rscript runs as expected and produces the expected output. However, if I let it run as scheduled, I get an error complaining that phantomjs isn't installed properly. This leads me to believe there is a problem with environment variables during the cron job.</p>  <p>I've tried to resolve this with:</p>  <pre><code>debug &lt;- system(paste0("cd /home/tony/casperjs/bin/; PHANTOMJS_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/share/phantomjs/bin; casperjs /home/tony/rscripts/launch/casper/script.js")) </code></pre>  <p>However, still fails when I let it run on its schedule.</p>  <p>UPDATE: The specific error I'm getting is:</p>  <pre><code>Fatal: [Errno 13] Permission denied; did you install phantomjs? </code></pre>
