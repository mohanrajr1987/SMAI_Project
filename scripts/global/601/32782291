<p>I am removing content with the "sed" command from the command line which is working perfectly.</p>  <p>Here is what I am using:</p>  <pre><code>sed '/&lt;g:id&gt;/,/&lt;g:brand&gt;/d' folder/folder2/file.xml &gt; folder/folder2/fileupdated.xml </code></pre>  <p>But I need this to run on its own through cron or maybe another method but I'm not sure where to start.</p>  <p>Please help :)</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
