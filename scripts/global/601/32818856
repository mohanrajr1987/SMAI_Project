<p>I am using pitch print to get customers to edit business cards through a woocommerce set up. When the order is created a link gets appended to the order for the admin/shop manager to download the rendered pdf. </p>  <p>The pdf is stored on the pitch print server, I believe via s3, and you need a signature/key to access the file. Which is ordinarily installed on the plugin admin.</p>  <p>I would like to set up a cron to automatically download the file, either when the order is created, or happy to settle for a times interval. </p>  <p>Post a comment for more clarification if needed. </p>  <p>Cheers</p>  <p>Andrew</p>
