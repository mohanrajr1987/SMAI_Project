<p>This is my first experience with cron jobs and I have gotten most of it done ok. However I am having a problem with php's file_put_contents. I know that the variable containing the file content is set because I had used the mail() function to email the content to myself. And yes I have read about problems with relative links in cron, so I am using a full url to no avail. Please help, thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Relevant Code:</p>  <pre><code>file_put_contents('http://www.aaron-schpitzer.ca/tmp/bookings/bookings.txt', $content); </code></pre>  <p>Also, how exactly do I find errors from cron?? I have shared hosting with CPanel. I've read about a way to set up a log but I believe the questions I've read would set it up in a directory that I don't have access to, /usr/bin/something I think it was.</p>
