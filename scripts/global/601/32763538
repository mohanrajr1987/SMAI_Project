<p>I would like to know what you use cron/anacron for? I mean, I know what cron is for, but I just don't have much use for it.. I use it as a reminder to upgrade pacman, I have a backup script for my media files, but not having a server and not being very creative with these stuff, I would like to know what you use it for? =)</p>
