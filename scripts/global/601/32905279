<p>I'm looking for a cron scheduling system with the possibility to 'spread out' tasks. Lets say I need to do a bit of work at 'round about' 12 o clock. The 'round about' is defined as lets say +/- 30 minutes. I need such a thing for my automated update task to not have all my millions of customers (joking...) downloading updates at exact the same time and just blowing up my webserver...</p>  <p>I know little about the existing cron libraries in java. I know there are cronj or quarz and dozen other systems - but I can't find out if one of them is able to do what I'm looking for.</p>  <p>At least I can implement such a 'spreading' feature (don't know how to call it better) myself by using a normal cron job and trigger a new Plain-Old-TimerTask with a little bit of Math.round() thingy... But would be nice if there is a native possibility for this.</p>  <p>Thanks and greetings</p>
