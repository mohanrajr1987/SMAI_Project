<p>I am trying the example given <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/reliable-task-scheduling-compute-engine-sample" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It uses google app engine, cloud engine and the pub/sub service to execute cron tasks on the GCE. It fairly simple to understand and execute. However I tried replacing the logger_sample_task.py code with my own code (give below). All it does is log a string to a log file. <em>Note: The script runs on Google compute engine</em></p>  <pre><code>import logging  logging.basicConfig(filename='testlog.log', level=logging.INFO) logging.info('Hope this works') </code></pre>  <p>However after the setup when I check if the cron task was run , the cron service has a status failed. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oRPf0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oRPf0.png" alt="cron status failed"></a></p>  <p>I followed all the steps exactly as given (both with and without  my custon script) but it still says cron job failed. Any reasons or ways to find out the  reason for this failure?</p>  <p>App engine has this error in its log:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1beta2/projects/dummy-project-1082/topics/test:publish?alt=json   returned "One or more messages in the publish request is empty. Each   message must contain either non-empty data, or at least one   attribute."></p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Got rid of the app engine error by following the suggestions in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16783776/google-app-engine-error">this post</a></p>
