<p>I am new to Zend &amp; working on Zend2, I have cron job functionality to make some automatic notifications. For this the functionality is ready &amp; it was set up in Cron (Linux server).</p>  <p>Now when ever a call is made to these functions they are getting redirected to Login action. Now I should allow these specific notification functions to get rid of this authentication process.</p>  <p>In cakephp we have <code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow('index')</code> which allows to work without login action. Is there a way to do similar to this in zend 2?</p>  <p>I've a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9788973/how-to-exclude-a-controller-action-from-authentication-in-zend-framework">link</a> similar to this. But it doesn't say where to mention the action name in the ACL</p>
