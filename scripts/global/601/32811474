<p>i need some help (i don't have much php knoledge) to implement the following:</p>  <p>There as a external server where i get a php feed of products via http url:</p>  <p><a href="http://servername/feed.php" rel="nofollow">http://servername/feed.php</a></p>  <p>i need to get that feed and duplicade that in another server (our server) in an automated process updated every 2 hours and avaiable by http for example like:</p>  <p><a href="http://serverb/feed.php" rel="nofollow">http://serverb/feed.php</a></p>  <p>in our server i have root acess / ftp/ ssh acess and in the external server only have access to the http feed.</p>  <p>The script before beginning to import have to check if the original server is up, if not send a mail with date time and information that the server is down. If it is up then run the import and rename the last file imported for feed.datetime (previous file) and of course the new file with the name feed.php.</p>  <p>In case of timeout the importation should be canceled and a mail with date/time and that information generated.</p>  <p>If importation as ok, generate a mail with that confirmation, date/time and size of the file feed.php.</p>  <p>For last if fails also generate a mail with date/time and failure reason.</p>  <p>any ideias ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
