<p>I need to list the upcoming commitments for a recurrent schedule. Say the commitment start on 1st Feb, 2015 and appear every 4 months, when user search for 2015 schedule, it should return 1st Feb, 1st Jun, 1st Oct. If schedule starts at 31st Dec 2014, and appear every 2 months, it should return 28th Feb, 30th Apr, 30th Jun, 31st Aug, 31st Oct, 31st Dec.</p>  <p>I tried with Quartz.net (or cronmaker.com), it yields different results. It is actually considering the base start as Jan 1st and calculating the rest of the result. For the CRON expression - "0 0 0 1 1/3 ? *", it returns the following results irrespective of start time.</p>  <ol> <li>Friday, May 1, 2015 12:00 AM</li> <li>Tuesday, September 1, 2015 12:00 AM</li> </ol>  <p>Is there any additional setting required to get this working as require?</p>
