<p>I need to scrape data from certain websites at 12.00 AM PST, and present that scraped data on my website. How should I implement this? Will it be server-side or client-side? Should I use <a href="https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-synced-cron" rel="nofollow">meteor-synced-cron</a>?</p>  <p>I was thinking I'll do it without <a href="https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-synced-cron" rel="nofollow">meteor-synced-cron</a>, and do it instead in <code>client/</code>, in that if the time is 12.00 AM, I update my collection for once and for all. Is that the right approach?</p>
