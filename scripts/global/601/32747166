<p>Okay, so I am new to scheduled task and cron methods, but I cannot figure out why a scheduled task that I have configured in the application-context.xml file of my application is not inserting into a certain database table. The schedule task carries out several processes by calling several methods, which take slightly longer than I would like, so I have it running at midnight every day. I configured this with using a cron pattern (cron="0 0 0 * * ?"). The method inserts into 4 different tables when it executes entirely. The first inserts a record into a specific table, which is then used as a FK for the second insertion, and so on. However, when the cron runs, the first insertion makes it, but the second insertion does not. I am currently logging the primary key IDs of the records inserted as this task executes, and I notice the second insertion returns a NULL primary key ID.</p>  <p>I am using Spring MVC and have created a controller method that allows me to run the <strong>same exact code</strong> that the cron method runs for testing purposes. When I deploy my application and execute this logic using the URL, my controller method picks up the request and executes everything accordingly, and <strong>ALL</strong> insertions to <strong>ALL</strong> tables take place. There are NO NULL Ids returned and all tables are updated as expected. But when I let the cron wake up and run this same exact code, not all insertions are successful, and I am not sure why this is happening.  </p>  <p>The logs show up like this when executing the method using the url:</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-23 10:32:44,251 [http-bio-8080-exec-6] DEBUG... - PK ID = 2024 </code></pre>  <p>and this when letting the cron execute it:</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-23 10:42:00,484 [pool-1-thread-1] DEBUG... - PK ID = null </code></pre>  <p>Is it a threading issue? Any help would be great.</p>
