<p>I have symfony2 project which I moved from a shared host to a VPS. I had a cron job command working in the shared host but I am unable to make it work in the VPS (WHM/cpanel CentOs 6).</p>  <p>The command I used in cpanel in the shared host was:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/local/php-5.6.12/bin/php /home/a155r66t/public_html/mydomain.com/app/console api:import </code></pre>  <p>In the VPS the route to the Symfony command is <em>/home/mydomain.com/app/console api:import</em> but I am unable to find which would be the route to the php in VPS. I tried these with no success:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/local/php-5.5.29/bin/php /home/mydomain.com/app/console api:import /usr/bin/php /usr/local/bin/php root php </code></pre>  <p>Can you please indicate how could i find the correct route to the php? Or what should it be? Thanks.</p>
