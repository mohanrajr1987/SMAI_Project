<p>I am trying to set up a cron job via cpanel. I have done so, but the problem is my php file contains a simple mail funtion to test if it works. It is not working.</p>  <p>I have found a few detailed tutorials about how to set up cron jobs, but they are complicated and most of it doesn't apply to cpanel, and a quick search here revealed no similar questions.</p>  <p>Is all I need to do is input the timing and command and the php file should execute??</p>  <p>Here is the command I have used in cPanel:</p>  <pre><code>*/3 *   *   *   * /home/stretch045/public_html/scripts/whazzup.php &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 </code></pre>  <p>Here is the whazzup.php file:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php //Script is run through cron  mail('stretch045@hotmail.com','test','test123'); </code></pre>
