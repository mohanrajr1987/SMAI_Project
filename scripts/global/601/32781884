<p><strong>Question.</strong> Is <code>cron</code> supposed to work in OSX El Capitan?</p>  <p><strong>Background.</strong> I've used crontab for years on OSX, but with El Capitan it seems not to work. I added my username to <code>/usr/lib/cron/cron.allow</code> and even rebooted the machine, but still my cron jobs don't do anything, nor do they mail me with errors. The manpages suggest Apple doesn't want people using cron, but they don't say it is nonfunctional (yet).</p>
