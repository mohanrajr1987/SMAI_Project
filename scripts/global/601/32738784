<p>I am trying to set a cron job where it will run php script and mail the results to user. However I am getting a permission denied error when the script is run. </p>  <pre><code>/bin/sh: /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/bdmail.php: Permission denied </code></pre>  <p>This is the code I am using in the command line:</p>  <pre><code>/var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/bdmail.php </code></pre>  <p>I would be grateful if someone could highlight my error. I have setup a new task in plesk and it looks correct to me. Thanks</p>  <p>OS: CentOS 6 with Parallels Plesk Panel 12 (64-bit)</p>
