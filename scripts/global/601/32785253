<p>I'm trying to setup regular backups of rethinkdb, but keep running into issues. How do you setup rethinkdb-dump to run from cron?</p>  <p>Here is my script:</p>  <pre><code>$ cat backup.sh  #!/bin/bash NOW=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")  /usr/bin/rethinkdb dump -e my_db -f /root/db_backup/$NOW.tar.gz </code></pre>  <p>The script runs just fine when I run it manually. However, when try and run it from cron it doesn't work and I get the following at <code>stderr</code>:</p>  <pre><code>Error when launching 'rethinkdb-dump': No such file or directory The rethinkdb-dump command depends on the RethinkDB Python driver, which must be installed. If the Python driver is already installed, make sure that the PATH environment variable includes the location of the backup scripts, and that the current user has permission to access and run the scripts. Instructions for installing the RethinkDB Python driver are available here: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/ </code></pre>  <p>It appears to be a Python environment issue, but I cannot figure out how to make it happy... thoughts? Help!</p>
