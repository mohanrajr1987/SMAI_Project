<p>How to set the X-axis in the histogram plot with a predefined break points instead of continuous break points.</p>  <pre><code>breaks=c(0,5,10,100,200,1000) </code></pre>  <p>The break points are chosen based on the frequency with in the bin ranges. How to achieve this instead of <code>breaks=c(0,5,10,15,20)</code> continuous break points ?</p>  <p>Edit: I have calculated the frequencies separately and plotted using <code>geom_bar</code> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2OmBp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2OmBp.png" alt="expected output"></a></p>  <p>Expecting similar output with the <code>hist</code> plot.</p>
