<p>The following code adds a text annotation of rsquared to a ggplot2 chart  </p>  <pre><code>ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=cty))+ geom_point()+ annotate("text", x=30, y=30, label="r^2", parse=TRUE) </code></pre>  <p>If I run ?plotmath, the right-hand column, labelled syntax, has many examples of mathematical expressions. If I copy any of these and substitute them for r^2 in the above example, the output appears as expected. With 2 exceptions: </p>  <p>group("(",list(a, b),"]") which produces Error: unexpected ']'</p>  <p>and</p>  <p>bgroup("(",atop(x,y),")") which produces Error: unexpected symbol</p>  <p>I would like to know how to annotate a ggplot2 chart with the text that group and bgroup are supposed to produce.</p>
