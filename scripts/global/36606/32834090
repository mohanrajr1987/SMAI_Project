<p>So I have the data the way I want it.  The only thing I need to change is adjusting the dates in the legend.  The way my data is structured in the line graph is the legend reads <code>20150101</code> , <code>20150202</code> , <code>20150303</code>, etc ..</p>  <p>I would like the legend in the graph to read <code>Jan</code>, <code>Feb</code>, <code>Mar</code>, <code>Apr</code>, etc.</p>  <p>Here's the R code after the query.  The legend consists of the Date_Trunc values.</p>  <p>I want to rename the legend, and ideally the axis, and title of the graph all in one function.  Please advise.  </p>  <pre><code>d &lt;- dbGetQuery(db, q)  d2 &lt;- ddply(d, .(date_trunc), transform, CUMSUM = cumsum(responses))  g &lt;- ggplot(d2, aes(x=business_day_number, y=CUMSUM, color=as.factor(date_trunc))) + geom_line()  g+ggtitle('Cumulative Responses') </code></pre>
