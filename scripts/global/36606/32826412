<p>I find violinplots quite pretty, but the way it is calculated is difficult to grasp for non-statisticians, the documentation is quite rudimentary. I am using the default values of the geom_violin function of ggplot2 in R. Does anybody knows <strong>what I could write in the material and method</strong> part of the paper, or get me a nice reference for it.</p>  <p>By the way, is the use of these plots clever, even if the distribution of the data is unknonwn? (example of figure can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/jcolomb/learningdata/blob/master/flightdata/analysis_R/firsttest_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jcolomb/learningdata/blob/master/flightdata/analysis_R/firsttest_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf</a>)</p>
