<p>Does anybody know how to change the background colour for the points legend in ggplot2. I have created the plot below and would like to change the white background on the legend? Any ideas?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iLrww.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iLrww.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
