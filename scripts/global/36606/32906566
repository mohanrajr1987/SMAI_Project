<p>I'm trying to capture the result of a ggplot2 graphic creation in memory, to send it to a server. Has anyone a good idea how to solve that?</p>  <p>My code looks currently like this:</p>  <pre><code>data(mtcars) x &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=hp)) +   geom_point(shape=1) print(x) # RStudio can capture the output, but I'm unable to do it. ggsave(filename="a.jpg", plot=x) # not really a solution, need it not on disk, but as blob in memory. </code></pre>
