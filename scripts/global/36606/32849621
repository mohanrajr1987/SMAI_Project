<p>I am unsure how to provide sample data; my data is currently in a .csv file and is very large. I can provide additional information about the data.</p>  <p>I have used the following code to generate boxplots of the mean for my variable Pun with error bars of the standard error of the mean. However, I did not treat subjects as a random effect (each subject had three trials). </p>  <p>I understand how to fit the random effects model thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1380694/how-to-fit-a-random-effects-model-with-subject-as-random-in-r">How to fit a random effects model with Subject as random in R?</a> but I am not sure how I can account for that when I plot it. MS is a factor with 2 levels, Harm is a factor with 4 levels. </p>  <pre><code>cdataPun &lt;- ddply(Emotions1, c("MS.f","Harm.f"), summarise,                   N=length(Pun),                   mean=mean(Pun),                   sd=sd(Pun),                   se=sd/sqrt(N))  ggplot(cdataPun, aes(x=Harm.f, y=mean, fill=MS.f)) +   geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity", colour="black", size=.3) +   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se), width=.2,                 position=position_dodge(.9))+   xlab("Harm Level") +   ylab("Punishment Rating") +   scale_fill_hue(name="Mental State",                  breaks=c("Blameless","Purposeful"),                  labels=c("Blameless","Purposeful")) +   ggtitle("Punishment Ratings by Harm and Mental State") +   scale_y_discrete(breaks=0:10*1) +   theme_bw() </code></pre>
