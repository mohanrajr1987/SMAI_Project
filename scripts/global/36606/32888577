<p>I have made a boxplot using <code>ggplot2</code> which appears beautifully coloured in R, with the corresponding legend. When I export this to plotly, the boxplots are all red, and the legend has disappeared.  I cannot post a picture of the plot on here, as it wont let me, but my code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>r &lt;- ggplot(data=all.data, aes(factor(Year), Data))+xlab("Year") r &lt;- r + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, aes(fill = factor(Month)))  r &lt;- r + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1, 6.5)) r &lt;- r+ scale_fill_discrete(name = "Month") r gg &lt;- ggplotly(r,kwargs=list(world_readable=FALSE)) </code></pre>  <p>I have included within the <code>geom_boxplot</code> layer the <code>fill</code> command which deals with colour, but I cannot understand why this is not transferring.</p>
