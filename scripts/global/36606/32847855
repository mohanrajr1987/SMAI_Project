<p>I'm trying to use ggplot to plot some data in a code block in R Markdown. (and knit to PDF using Knitr)  However I keep getting this error:</p>  <p><em>Error in seq.default(from = best$lmin, to = best$lmax, by = best$lstep) :    'from' must be of length 1 Calls:  ... scale_breaks.continuous ->  ->  -> seq -> seq.default</em></p>  <p>Here's the code that's generating the error:</p>  <pre><code>``` {r }  ggplot(data=d, aes(x=var2, y=value, group=var1)) + geom_line() + scale_x_discrete(labels=as.character(c(1:5)))  ``` </code></pre>  <p>"d" is a data frame with variables:</p>  <ul> <li>value : numeric  </li> <li>var1 : character, one of "x", "y", "z"  </li> <li>var2 : character, one of "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"</li> </ul>  <p>Basically, I want a plot of "var2" by "value" with a separate line for each "var1".</p>  <p>I checked for NA, NULL or NaN values in the data, and there are none.</p>  <p>Also when I run this code in the Console (instead of R Markdown), it works perfectly.</p>  <p>Can anyone tell me what's causing the error?</p>  <p>Thanks!!</p>
