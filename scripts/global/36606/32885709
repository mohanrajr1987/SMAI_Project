<p>I am trying to plot a vector, <code>y</code> which has 604800 points, against a sequence: <code>x=seq(from=1, to=604800)</code>. This is not a problem, but I do need to add a loess curve to the plots.</p>  <p>I have tried this using <code>ggplot2</code> but this takes forever, and is notoriously bad at plotting large datasets. See R code:</p>  <pre><code>vf &lt;- ggplot(single.prop, aes(x,y)) + geom_line(linetype=1, size=1) vf &lt;- vf + stat_smooth(method="loess",fullrange=TRUE,aes(outfit=fit1&lt;&lt;-..y..)) vf </code></pre>  <p>I have now tried to use the <code>base</code> package, but this is also taking forever:</p>  <pre><code>lw &lt;- loess(y ~ x,data=single.prop) plot(y ~ x, data=single.prop,pch=19,cex=0.1) k &lt;- order(single.prop$x) lines(single.prop$x[k],lw$fitted[k],col="red",lwd=3) </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone else have any suggestions about what I can do to make this run quicker? I have to do this multiple times, and have so far been waiting about 15 minutes for one plot, and is still not completed.</p>
