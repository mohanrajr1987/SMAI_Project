<p>When my script opens the chromedriver (<code>driver = webdriver.Chrome()</code>) in Windows 10, the window maximizes to full size on my monitor. To minimize disruption, I would prefer it was barely noticeable. The closest I can get is the following:</p>  <pre><code>    driver = webdriver.Chrome()     driver.set_window_size(1, 1) </code></pre>  <p>This works well in that the window size is minimal. Unfortunately, it still first pops open to the full monitor and then readjusts to the preferred minimal size. Is there any way to preset the window size before opening up the chromedriver?</p>
