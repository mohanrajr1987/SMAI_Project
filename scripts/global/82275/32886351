<p>is there anyway that driver Could remember the <code>logged in session</code>, so it doesn't take me back to <code>Login</code> page (e.g. like <code>google-chrome</code>)?</p>  <p>this is what I'm doing at the moment</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {      driver = new ChromeDriver();     driver.get("http://localhost/interestingStuff);  //I get redirected to login page       login(); //logins in to the page and submits(note I try to omit this part if possible).     doStuff();      driver.close(); //I want to be able to keep session next time I start this program.   } </code></pre>
