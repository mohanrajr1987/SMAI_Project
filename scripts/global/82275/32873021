<p>I have this selenium application that contains an uploads file function that gets called recursively after every upload on the website</p>  <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>  <p>The function is being called very quickly and it is not waiting for the upload to be done. Which is messing up the whole application process. I know I can add <code>time.sleep()</code> however I do not know the size of the files and how long the upload will take. So I prefer to add a check to see if the files are uploaded</p>  <p><strong>My Solution</strong></p>  <p>Luckily for me a successful message pops up when uploads are done</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v6ckF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v6ckF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So I decided to add the <code>success_element</code> that waits for the success message to pop out as seen in the code below</p>  <pre><code>def upload(driver, fileNum, filePath):       #click ok to upload       ok_link = driver.find_element_by_class_name("borderButton")       ok_link.click()       #wait for success message to pop out( FAILS )       success_wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 1200)       success_element =   success_wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located(By.LINK_TEXT("File(s) have(s) been uploaded successfully!")))       #call function again to upload more after succesful message pops out       upload(driver, fileNum, filePath) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Error</strong>:</p>  <p>I got this error below right after the first group of files are uploaded, because it did not find the success message right away, which it is not supposed to anyway and I thought it would wait for it after upload is done for 1200 seconds (roughly 20 minutes which is the max)</p>  <p>How can I solve this problem. Any other solutions ?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>success_element =   success_wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located(By.LINK_TEXT("File(s)   have(s) been uploaded successfully!"))) TypeError: 'str' object is not   callable</p> </blockquote>
