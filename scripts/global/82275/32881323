<p>I have an webpage which contains ticket number input field.</p>  <p>If i enter the ticket number, PDF report will be displayed on the webpage.. I guess PDF is embedded in the webpage.</p>  <p>I can change the status of the ticket in the PDF (to closed), i can check the check box about category and enter the remarks in the input field.</p>  <p>I am able to enter the ticket in the web block but other than all about PDF entries. I know that selenium webdriver does NOT have this scope. Is there any chance we enter the values using any other script or language and we can call from selenium? </p>  <p>AutoIt is not allowed for me pls suggest any other way to do if it is possible.</p>
