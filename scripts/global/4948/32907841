<p>I have a macro-enabled Word document which has been distributed to colleagues. Unfortunately some of them still don't understand that it has to be saved as a DOCM to retain the interactive functionality.</p>  <p>I found a very similar question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12111491/force-save-as-xlsm-while-maintaining-file-structure">here</a> for an Excel workbook but the code does not seem to translate properly for my Word doc.</p>  <p>I get a <code>Compile error: Method or data member not found</code> on line 4; <code>.GetSaveAsFilename</code></p>  <p>EDIT: Just ran through all code and it also does it on lines 9 and 15 on <code>.EnabledEvents</code></p>  <pre><code>Private Sub App_DocumentBeforeSave(ByVal Doc As Document, SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As      Dim FileNameVal As String     If SaveAsUI Then         FileNameVal = Application.GetSaveAsFilename(, "Word Macro-Enabled Document (*.docm), *.docm")         Cancel = True         If FileNameVal = "False" Then             Exit Sub         End If         Application.EnableEvents = False             If Right(ThisDocument.Name, 5) &lt;&gt; ".docm" Then                 ThisDocument.SaveAs FileName:=FileNameVal &amp; ".docm", FileFormat:=wdFormatXMLDocumentMacroEnabled             Else                 ThisDocument.SaveAs FileName:=FileNameVal, FileFormat:=wdFormatXMLDocumentMacroEnabled             End If         Application.EnableEvents = True     End If End Sub </code></pre>
