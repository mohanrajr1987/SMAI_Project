<p>I have a docx document which contains conditional breaks (<code>Ctrl + -</code>). I'm converting them to markdown and later (with jekyll) to HTML. Unfortunately, the conditional breaks are lost. A workaround is to edit the generated markdown document and insert <code>&amp;shy;</code>, but this is not a solution since I need to generate the markdown from the docx regulary.</p>  <p>How can I tell pandoc to keep the conditional breaks?</p>  <p>Edit: It does not only occur when converting to markdown, the conditional breaks are also lost when converting directly to HTML.</p>
