<p>I am coding a program that changes the format of a list of words as you write in Ms-Word.</p>  <p>I am using the Range.Find.Execute to find the desired text I want to modify and then I modify the range (for example for italics)</p>  <pre><code>myRange.Find.Execute(FindText:="inicialText", ReplaceWith:="newTextInItalics") myRange.Italic = 1 </code></pre>  <p>Everything is working fine, except when the word I am changing is the last word. Then, the style remains in Ms-Word. So if you continue typing, the new text inserted will be in italics which I do not want to be the case.</p>  <p>I have also tried to collapse the range and remove italics:</p>  <pre><code>myRange.Collapse(WdCollapseDirection.wdCollapseEnd) myRange.Italic = 0 </code></pre>  <p>But that does not work either!</p>  <p>The only possible workaround I could think of is to simulate the hotkey to toggle bold (Ctrl + B) / italic (Ctrl + I) / underline (Ctrl + U) but it has many inconveniences for example it depends on the language. In Spanish Ctrl + N for bold, etc.</p>  <p>P.D.  I am testing it with Word 2003 and 2007 but I want to be as extensive in compatibility as possible.</p>  <p>I am coding in VB.NET but it does not matter because if you know a way to do it in vba I will adapt the code.</p>
