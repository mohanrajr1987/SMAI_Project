<p>I would like to retrieve part of a document(s) using AltChunk in order to preserve image and formatting from the original documents. I see examples of importing full document using AltChunk but no where I found documents on importing parts (I am particularly interested in paragraph(s)) of document.</p>  <p>For example I was reading <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.altchunk.aspx" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's documentation regarding altchunk</a> and see that it is dumping the whole document to another document but not part of the document.</p>  <p>Also, I see that they have to have destination document in order to pass the document. I eventually would output to a file but not immediately.</p>  <p>Ultimately, I do not have to use AltChunk, but I came across it as easy solution to preserve the image and formatting from previous documents to generate a combined document (I tried using it to combined two complete documents, and I agree it was easiest solution for sure). So I am open for any other suggestion for what I am trying to accomplish.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <p>Edit : 10/2 </p>  <p>I may try to use <a href="http://ericwhite.com/blog/documentbuilder-expanded/" rel="nofollow">Eric White's</a> <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools" rel="nofollow">OpenXmlPowerTool</a> instead. More specifically <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericwhite/archive/2009/02/05/move-insert-delete-paragraphs-in-word-processing-documents-using-the-open-xml-sdk.aspx" rel="nofollow">this page</a> seems to contain very good information regarding their tool.</p>
