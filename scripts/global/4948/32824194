<p>I'm using PHPWord for reading a Word template with strings that must be replaced with other values. PHPWord has the TemplateProcessor class, which is exactly what i need, but i need to change the search pattern used by default, which is</p>  <pre><code>${search-pattern}  </code></pre>  <p>I have tried changing the code in TemplateProcessor but it doesn't work.</p>  <p>How can I change the search pattern used by PHPWord?</p>
