<p>I'm trying to set Office 2016's macro security settings from a shell script. Any idea where Office 2016 saves the “Prompt when opening a file containing macros” setting? </p>  <p>In 2011 it used to be in: 14\Options\Options:EnableMacroVirusProtection</p>  <p>So I could set it using "defaults write" from the command line.</p>  <p>There doesn’t appear to be a comparable “15” preference setting, and the 14 option doesn’t seem to have any effect on 2016, whether set at the user level, sandbox level, or with sudo.</p>
