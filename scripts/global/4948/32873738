<p>I have a word template for a application Form (which contains text, dropdowns, checkboxes, date fields..). In my web application whenever user starts a new process they need to fill some high level data, here I need to fill some of the user entered data into the word template and let user download that document. Later user takes this document offline and fills empty lower level fields in that document, whenever they are done filling they will upload the document back into the application. Now I need to read the values of each field that user entered and store those values in Database.</p>  <p>Can someone give me the direction how to achieve this using java.</p>  <p>Or is there a better way to achieve the same with other than the word templates.</p>
