<p>I have completed a ms-office 2013 add-in using Visual Studio2015. Is it possible to install it and make it work on a computer running word 2007? Do I have to create an installer?</p>  <p>Sorry for the noob question but until now I have only worked with Visual Studio to make small improvements to my documents, so this is the first time that I need to export something on a different envinronment.</p>
