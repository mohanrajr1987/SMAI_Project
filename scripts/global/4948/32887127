<p>I am working on a web application and don't want user to input some invalid characters which are creating problems.</p>  <p>One such character which is causing problem is <strong>diamond bullet</strong> from MS word but to remove that character I need to know the Unicode of the character so that I could include it in the Python regular expression of invalid characters <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5698267/efficient-way-to-search-for-invalid-characters-in-python">as suggested here</a>.</p>  <pre><code>textString = some value which need to be checked for invalid characters pattern = some regular expression for invalid characters if pattern.search(textString):     print 'Invalid characters found' else:     print 'Valid string' </code></pre>  <p>I found a similar solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19399244/view-the-character-unicode-values-of-a-word-document#">here</a> but this is not working for bullets.</p>  <p>Guys please help me resolving this issue.</p>
