<p>Is there a way to stack up two lines just on side of one line?</p>  <p>Here is the example. I want to write number on top and email at bottom with name on the list.</p>  <p>I know I can easily use tables with diving 2 rows in 2nd column but I cannot use tables as resume will not allow it. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l1GgA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l1GgA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
