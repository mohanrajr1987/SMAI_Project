<p>This code does not work since the system was changed (from Windows XP to Windows 7) and so the version of Word (Word 2003 or 2007 to Word 2010).</p>  <p>I have 5852 error when trying to merge. Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>Documents.Open FileName:="myfile.doc" ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes = True If ActiveDocument.MailMerge.State = wdMainAndDatatSource Then    With ActiveDocument.MailMerge     .Destination = wdSendToNewDocument     .SuppressBlankLines = True     .Execute    End With End If </code></pre>  <p>ActiveDocument is the document where I have the mask and the fields I have to fill.   </p>
