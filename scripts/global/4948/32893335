<p>This might be covered already but I'm trying to create dependent drop down lists in MS word. I saw some examples online that help create VB code to do the same.However I had tough time creating one.</p>  <p>So for example if i had to create dependent drop down list like </p>  <p>2 drop downs, one for cars, bikes, trucks as the main classification and the next should look like</p>  <p>Nissan, Ford and chevy as the drop down list when i select cars  Harley,Honda  as the drop down list for bikes Volvo, Freight liner, kenworth   as the drop down list for trucks.</p>  <p>So when i click on the selection "trucks" from the main classification i should get Volvo, Freight liner and kenworth as options in the word document and same would be the case for others.I would like to know If there are other means(like softwares) or methods to do the same. Thanks for the help in advance. </p>
