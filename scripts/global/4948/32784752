<p>I'm writing a macro which pastes graphs from an excel file into word.</p>  <pre><code>Worksheets(worksheetname).Activate ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(chartname).Activate Selection.Cut mydoc.Activate </code></pre>  <p>with worksheetname etc declared and defined correctly. </p>  <p>I have no idea how to refer to a line in a word document from within excel VBA. I have refer to a line in the document, I can paste it in.</p>  <p>edit:To clarify, I can paste into a paragraph in word. I'm looking to specify the location better than the beginning of the paragraph: either in a specific line, or specifying the end of the paragraph. /edit</p>  <p>My only ideas are:</p>  <pre><code>Rng = mydoc.Range(doc.Paragraphs(1).Start, mydoc.Paragraphs(1).End - 1).paste </code></pre>  <p>but I think that is in word-style VBA, which doesn't seem to work.</p>  <p>Cheers!</p>
