<p>I have a word document which contains 6 series of numbers (plain text, not numbered style) as following:</p>  <pre><code>1) blah blah blah 2) again blah blah blah . . . 20) something </code></pre>  <p>And this pattern has been repeated six times. How can I used Regex and serialise all numbers before parentheses so that they start with <code>1</code> and end up with <code>120</code>?</p>
