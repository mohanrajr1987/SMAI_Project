<p>I am new to VBA for Mac an so far not impressed, cannot even create a userform which is how I would normally have accomplished this task.</p>  <p>I want to have message boxes come up and ask me for information that will then populate multiple instances via search and replace.</p>  <p>For example the first part is to ask for the document author and once the msgbox has the answer it will then replace the string  in the document. </p>  <p>I have tried many different variations but in every case after the first two msgbox sections I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>Sub auto_open()  Dim Author As String Dim Title As String Dim Longname As String Dim Shortname As String Dim Reference As String Dim Createdate As String Dim myStoryRange As Range   Author = InputBox(Prompt:="Enter your name here please.", _       Title:="Document Author", Default:="Your Name here")      With ActiveDocument.Content.Find     .Text = "&lt;Document Author&gt;"     .Replacement.Text = Author     .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll     .ClearFormatting     End With  Title = InputBox(Prompt:="Proposal, Maintenance Agreement etc?", _       Title:="Document Title", Default:="Proposal")      With ActiveDocument.Content.Find     .Text = "&lt;Document Title&gt;"     .Replacement.Text = Title     .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll     .ClearFormatting     End With   Longname = InputBox(Prompt:="Client's full legal name as per their ABN or ACN", _       Title:="Client's Full Name", Default:="      Pty Ltd")      With ActiveDocument.Content     .Find.Text = "&lt;Long Customer Name&gt;"     .Replacement.Text = Longname     .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll     .ClearFormatting     End With   Shortname = InputBox(Prompt:="Enter the usual name by which the client is known.", _       Title:="Client's short name or abbreviation", Default:="  ")      With ActiveDocument.Content     .Find.Text = "&lt;Short Customer Name&gt;"     .Replacement.Text = Shortname     .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll     .ClearFormatting     End With   Reference = InputBox(Prompt:="Use the number generated by Sales Force", _       Title:="Reference/Proposal number", Default:="  ")      With ActiveDocument.Content     .Find.Text = "&lt;Reference Number&gt;"     .Replacement.Text = Reference     .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll     .ClearFormatting     End With   Createdate = InputBox(Prompt:="Enter todays date or the date you will submit this proposal", _       Title:="Date document created", Default:=Now())      With ActiveDocument.Content     .Find.Text = "&lt;Date Created&gt;"     .Replacement.Text = Createdate     .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll     .ClearFormatting     End With  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>As you can see here the section for Author and Title work fine but the exact same code for <code>LongName</code> and onwards do not??</p>  <p>(Sorry tried to show picture but not allowed yet)</p>  <p>End result is once the code gets to <code>LongName</code> it errors with:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Compile error:</p>      <p>Method or data member not found   (ThisDocument 34:8)</p> </blockquote>
