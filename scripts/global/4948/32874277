<p>I have to create documents that have large tables of data copied into them from Excel. The tables can be hundreds of rows long and generally ~20 columns wide. Many of the columns have been merged vertically to enhance readability and group sets of data. </p>  <p>I have been able to write a macro that will fully format the entire table, except I have not been able to figure out how to automatically prevent the Vertically Merged cells from breaking/splitting across multiple pages. To do it manually, you select all of the rows in the merger except for the last one and then you turn on "Keep With Next" in the paragraph settings. I thought this would be easy to do, but you can not access individual rows in VBA if there are any vertically merged cells in the table. </p>  <p>Does anyone have an idea how to automatically go through the rows and set the "Keep With Next" property for groups of rows that have been merged together?</p>  <p>Here is an example of how Word normally handles vertically merged cells across tables: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BUNAP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BUNAP.png" alt="Here is an example of how Word normally handles vertically merged cells across tables"></a></p>  <p>This is how I would like it to look, with doing all the work manually: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/36GKb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/36GKb.png" alt="This is how I would like it to look, with doing all the work manually"></a></p>
