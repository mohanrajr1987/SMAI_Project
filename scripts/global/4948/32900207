<p>here is the situation: I saved a Microsoft Word 2007 file on a usb flash drive (but not on my pc hard drive). Now I lost the usb flash drive. The file was in a folder on the usb flash drive. I can see the name of the file in Microsoft Word Recent Documents and I can see the folder name but it is display as a shortcut in C:/Users//AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Office/Recent/. When I try to open it I get a message saying:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The drive or network connection that the shortcut 'my_file.LNK' refers to is unavailable. Make sure that the disk is properly inserted or the network resource is available and then try again.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is there any way that I can recover that folder and my file that is in it please?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help</p>
