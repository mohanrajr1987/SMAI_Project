<p>I have a few questions about Office 2016. I currently only use Word 2013 and I’m only interested in whether features removed from it over the years have been restored.</p>  <p>Can I edit the right-click menu?</p>  <p>Can I change Ribbon button icons?</p>  <p>Autocorrect: Always correct to right click menu item.</p>  <p>Has something like the Save My Settings Wizard returned?</p>  <p>There is not a single new feature in Office 2016 I’m interested in. Well, maybe the darker themes, but I don’t feel like I should have to pay just for them.</p>
