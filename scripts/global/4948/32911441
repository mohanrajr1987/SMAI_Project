<p>I have a macro for Word that I would like to share with people, I want to create a batch file that installs the macro into word and assign it to a button.</p>  <p>Here is the batch file I have right now:</p>  <pre><code>copy "Collapse.dotm" = "%appdata%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP" "%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office15\Winword.exe" /mCollapse </code></pre>  <p>First the batch script copies the macro to the Word Startup folder. Then the script launches word, I ran the script and it is telling me it can't copy the macro.</p>  <p>EDIT: The error message was that Word could open up the template, I changed the extension to .dot instead of .dotm. With that change the script runs without errors, the template can be seen in the VBA Editor but doesn't create a macro.</p>  <p>EDIT 2: It creates a new project in the VBA that is unviewable though.</p>
