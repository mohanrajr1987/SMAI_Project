<p>How do you use images from the web as an footer and header in Microsoft Word.</p>  <p>eg. Insert <a href="http://h.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/1280/poster/2014/03/3025992-poster-p-designwork.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://h.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/1280/poster/2014/03/3025992-poster-p-designwork.jpg</a> as an image in the footer</p>  <p>I want it so that if the image updates you only have to change the image on the link and then it will update in all the word docs its placed on</p>  <p>Does anyone know?</p>
