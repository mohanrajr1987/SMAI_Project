<p>Morning Everyone,</p>  <p>using interop.word to do a find/replace in the header.  It works but word, in it's great wisdom, adds spaces: 1 space to the beginning of each line after the first, 2-3 spaces at the end of each line. So it looks like this but it should be completely left:</p>  <pre><code>Sept 2, 2015  first name     last name    address    </code></pre>  <p>I am looking at the text of the header after replacement using headerfooter.range.text and there are no extra spaces so it has to be an auto-formatting issue that word is obsessed with. </p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>  <hr>  <p>What I have tried with no luck:</p>  <p><code>paragraphformat.duplicate before and reset after range.paragraphformat.spacebefore = 0 range.paragraphformat.spaceafter = 0</code></p>  <pre><code>Dim info As String = Now.ToLongDateString &amp; vbCrLf &amp; Trim(PersonInformation.FullName) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; Trim(PersonInformation.Address) info &amp;= vbCrLf &amp; Trim(PersonInformation.City &amp; ", " &amp; PersonInformation.State &amp; " " &amp; PersonInformation.Zip) hf.Range.Find.Execute(TagToReplace, , , , , , , , , info) </code></pre>  <hr>  <p><strong>UPDATED</strong></p>  <p>Found the answer.  It is how word/interop interprets vbcrlf when generating the doc.  Using just vbcr did the trick.  vblf also caused the inserted space.  Incidentally, vbNewLine also caused the extra space to appear.</p>
