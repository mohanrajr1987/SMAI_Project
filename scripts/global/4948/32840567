<p>I am doing some open xml manipulations on word document.</p>  <p>It has several sdt content, all contained in a sdt block.</p>  <p>I copy paste programatically the sdt block each time I need.</p>  <p>The thing is, I don't success keeping the sdt block on a single page.</p>  <p>I tried to add a style in word directly to the sdt block but this doesn't work.</p>  <p>The conditions are :</p>  <p>one sdt block must be entirely on the same page.</p>  <p>After searching a lot, I did'nt find any solutions that fit my need. Only solutions concerning one paragraph, and not a sdt block containing sdt contents, that is way different.</p>  <p>If it is possible : Does it must be in word? In the c# code?</p>
