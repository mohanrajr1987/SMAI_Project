<p>I am trying to fix a setting or file that is causing a problem on the TOC in word for some users in my office. We have a group templates system in word where everyone uses the same normal template and template files. Recently one of the users has started getting errors in the TOC in the templates where not all the headings are shown with level 1 missing.</p>  <p>I can re-insert the TOC in the file and then it is fine on that machine with all the level 1, 2 and 3 headings, but then I have exactly the same problem on my machine when opening that same file. </p>  <p>I have tried recopying the files to make sure they are in fact the same versions. I have tried re-applying the document styles on both machines. Also tried re-creating the list styles in case this is causing it and going through the document and updating all the heading styles. </p>  <p>Now I am out of ideas and stuck :(</p>
