<p>In word I am looking for a keyboard short cut which allows me to move the paragraph in which my cursor currently is one paragraph/line up or down.</p>  <p>I am new to VBA etc, but found this </p>  <pre><code>Sub OutlineMoveUp()     Selection.Range.Relocate wdRelocateUp End Sub </code></pre>  <p>This comes pretty close to what I am looking for, but seems to move the paragraph up according to its position in the outline structure (what can become rather confusing). I just want to move it one paragraph/line up or down (also irrespective of its formatting).</p>  <p>(RStudio offers this nice feature where you can simply move selected text lines without copy-pasting; I am looking for the equivalent in word). </p>  <p>many thx.</p>
