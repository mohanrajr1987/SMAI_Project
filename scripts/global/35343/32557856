<p>help!!! i want the "Approver" defend in the column where names are listed so the "Approver" automatically filled upon what the column has. so i what i did is copy and modified the default workflow using sharepoint designer and changed the "Parameter:Approvers" to the column i created in site or list. to do that i associated the column then changed the "Parameter:Approvers" to the column i associate. maybe "im done". The problem is when item created the item is automatically "rejected" and when the workflow manually started the item works well. i already checked the "start workflow automatically when an item is created".  any suggestion guys??? help... </p>
