<p>I have created a List within SharePoint 2010 and would like certain fields to be pre-populated from an Access data source, when a field is populated in the SharePoint List.</p>  <p>For example, I have two fields that can be populated in the list. One is the Country and the other is the City. In the Access database there is a list of data showing Cities available for each Country.</p>  <p>The outcome would be when a user selects the country in the SharePoint list, the SharePoint list draws upon the Access database to return the options available to select for city.</p>  <p>If anyone has any experience in this area or can refer me to a thread that already answers this, that would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
