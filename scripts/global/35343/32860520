<p>first of all I have the following components: <br></p>  <ul> <li>SharePoint 2010 Server (intranet -> accessable only by valid domain account)</li> <li>SharePoint Lists I need to read</li> <li>Java Client Application consuming SharePoint REST service (not working!)</li> </ul>  <p>I've searched for a while now and I can't find a working java version to consume a REST service from a SharePoint 2010 server with domain authentication. I already tried Spring Framework for this issue which does not really help.</p>  <p>I changed the example code (from <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/" rel="nofollow">https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/</a>) to following and it works fine:</p>  <pre><code>RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); String s = restTemplate.getForObject("http://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io/api/random", String.class); System.out.println(s); </code></pre>  <p>But my URL looks completely different: "<a href="http://server/site/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/listName" rel="nofollow">http://server/site/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/listName</a>"</p>  <p>When I try to make the same call with my URL I get the error message: org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException: 400 Bad Request</p>  <p>So my first problem is to make the Spring Framework work with the SharePoint REST service. Since I also tried plain Http-calls I assume that I will get an authentication problem in the next step since the SharePoint server is only accessable by people authenticated by the active directory (with valid kerberos ticket).</p>  <p>Can anyone help me to get this SharePoint REST &lt;-> Java communication to work ?</p>
