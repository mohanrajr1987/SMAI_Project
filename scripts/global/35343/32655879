<p>Looking for a generic VBA code to use in a master file that pulls in cell data from multiple workbooks located on a SharePoint without opening the files.  All the workbooks are exact copies of one another.  Here's the code I've been attempting to use:</p>  <pre><code>Private Function GetValue(path, file, sheet, ref) Dim arg As String  If Right(path, 1) &lt;&gt; "\" Then path = path &amp; "/" If Dir(path &amp; file) = "" Then GetValue = "File Not Found" Exit Function End If  arg = "'" &amp; path &amp; "[" &amp; file &amp; "]" &amp; sheet &amp; "'!" &amp; _ Range(ref).Range("A1").Address(, , xlR1C1)  GetValue = ExecuteExcel4Macro(arg) End Function Sub TestGetValue()     p = "https://sharepoint/folder/"     f = "ABC.xlsm"     s = "ABC1"     a = "A1"     MsgBox GetValue(p, f, s, a) End Sub </code></pre>
