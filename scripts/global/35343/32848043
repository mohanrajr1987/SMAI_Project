<p>I'm trying to migrate our existing TFS 2008/SharePoint installation to TFS 2012/SharePoint 2010. If I do it without SharePoint it all works OK, but if I try and include SharePoint it fails.</p>  <p>At the moment I'm starting from scratch and including SharePoint.</p>  <p>I've run the Configure Extensions for SharePoint Products Wizard, restored the TFS 2008 databases, run STSADM from the command line, and now I'm attempting to run the TFS 2012 Upgrade Wizard: it fails at the, Configure the Server Running SharePoint step with the error "TF250004: The SharePoint Products installation is either corrupt or is not valid. Verify that SharePoint Products is a supported version and is functioning properly, and then try again."</p>  <p>Can someone please advise me what I've done wrong?</p>
