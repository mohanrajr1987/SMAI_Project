<p>I am working on a project which involves linking task list from SharePoint 2010 to MS Access for updating item details based on business requirements. There are filters based on 'Created By' and 'Assigned To' columns = [Me] which restricts users to view tasks not assigned or created by them. This works when the user  opens up the SharePoint task list on browser with applied filters. However, when this task list is linked using MS Access, a user is able to see all items under the linked table which bypasses the filtering restrictions. How do I achieve the filtering logic to be applied in MS Access as well, any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
