<p>So I trying to come up with a script to check and report files from my sharepoint according to some criteria. I need however authenticate using the company Active Directory.</p>  <p>I have done some research and all I've found seem far too advanced for what I intend and would prefer not to spend the whole time learning <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/auth/customizing/" rel="nofollow">django custom auth</a>. <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/haufe.sharepoint" rel="nofollow">Haufe.sharepoint</a> seems simpler, but I didn't manage to list all folders from a URL with it. </p>  <p>I must confess I don't really understand Sharepoint very much either, though I'm assuming it could behave sorta like a file repository for my purpose. So I will not be offended if someone points out that what I’m trying to do doesn’t make sense.</p>  <p>Anyways, I have an url like <code>http://intranet/sharedir/Archive/Projects/Customer1</code> and under it many folders containing subfolders and files.</p>  <p>What I want is, given the URL (like the one above), list all directories and files contained. After that I will iterate over the items and apply the rules I’m interested.</p>  <p>If someone could provide some Python code example or reference would be great.</p>
