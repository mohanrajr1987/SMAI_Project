<p>I want to read text form my webpart. Its a simple one: just a line of text - nothing else. I can get properties of my webparts (like title, desc etc) but can't get the content of it. Any ideas how to retreive this information? Thanks in advance.</p>  <pre><code>using (SPSite site = new SPSite("http://mysite/pwa/some_web"))         {             using (SPWeb web = site.OpenWeb())             {                 SPFile file = web.GetFile("default.aspx");                  using (SPLimitedWebPartManager wpm = file.GetLimitedWebPartManager(System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.Shared))                 {                     foreach (Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.WebParts.WebPart wp in wpm.WebParts)                     {                                                     Console.WriteLine("Web part: {0}", wp.Title);                     }                 }             }         } </code></pre>
