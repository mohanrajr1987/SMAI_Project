<p>In my Sharepoint 2010 project, I need to access the values of html elements that I create in the *.ascx file (standard HTML). Trying to "find" those elements via their IDs has so far failed for me (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32640663/why-does-marking-an-html-element-of-type-date-run-at-server-fail-in-sharepoint">this question</a>) for some insight into that.</p>  <p>Also, attempts to push the data from jQuery to the code-behind via Ajax have not succeeded.</p>  <p>So I'm wondering if the HtmlAgilityPack can be used from the server (C#) side of a Sharepoint project to inspect its "own" HTML running in the browser. Is this possible, or can HtmlAgilityPack only be used on external web sites?</p>  <p>IOW, would it be able to access the specific instance of the currently running "instance" of the page, which would have the user's entries?</p>  <p>If not, I will probably have to create all the elements in the code-behind, so that I can reference them by name.</p>
