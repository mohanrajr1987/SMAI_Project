<p>I want to respond to the insertion of data into a Sharepoint list (which will be done from the client/JavaScript (*.asxc file) in the code-behind/C#. </p>  <p>Is there a way to do that? Can I hook up an "OnListUpdated" handler in the Sharepoint Web Part's code-behind (*.ascx.cs) file?</p>  <p>I want to let the user just select one button, which will populate the list (from the client) and then immediately thereafter generate a PDF file (from the server).</p>  <h2>UPDATE</h2>  <p>I've got the following code:</p>  <pre><code>namespace PostTravelWizard.PostTravelItemEventReceiver {     public class PostTravelItemEventReceiver : SPItemEventReceiver     {        public override void ItemAdded(SPItemEventProperties properties)        {            base.ItemAdded(properties);            // TODO: Is this all that is needed?            PostTravelWizardWebPartUserControl.GeneratePDF();         }         public override void ContextEvent(SPItemEventProperties properties)        {            base.ContextEvent(properties);            // TODO: What "context event" occurs here? To what event should I respond?        }      } } </code></pre>  <p>...but I don't want to respond to every insert into the list; I only want to respond to the last one - when the updating is complete. But how I know when that is, I don't know. Will I have to put a "bogus" entry with a value like "that's all, folks!", look for that value, and then go from there, or is there a more sensible/less kludgy way of indicating/deciphering when it's done?</p>
