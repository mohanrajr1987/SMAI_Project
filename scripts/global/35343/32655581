<p>I want to create a WSP which connects sharepoint to oracle. On my research on this I came to know that i can use either <code>Oracle.DataAccess</code> DLL or <code>System.Data.OracleClient</code>. But both of them are not sucessfull. <code>Oracle.DataAccess</code> DLL can only be used with its dependencies. It throws error as:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not load file or assembly <code>Oracle.DataAccess</code> or one of its   dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect   format.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Also it cannot be added along with a wsp where as <code>System.Data.OracleClient</code> throws error</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Attempt to load Oracle client libraries threw BadImageFormatException.   This problem will occur when running in 64 bit mode with the 32 bit   Oracle client components installed.</p> </blockquote>
