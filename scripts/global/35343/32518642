<p>I am writing a java program to list all files under a specific folder on our sharepoint 2010 site. The site URL is <a href="http://teams.in.gbmr/dev/Digital/Analytics" rel="nofollow">http://teams.in.gbmr/dev/Digital/Analytics</a> This site hosts hundreds of documents under multiple folders and subfolders.</p>  <p>I am interested in the directory "/dev/Digital/Analytics/Shared Documents/Logs/debug logs"</p>  <p>When I type this URL in a browser- <a href="http://teams.in.gbmr/dev/Digital/Analytics/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/SharedDocuments" rel="nofollow">http://teams.in.gbmr/dev/Digital/Analytics/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/SharedDocuments</a>, I get a XML response that is more than 7000 lines long.</p>  <p>What tools/libraries/frameworks are available to parse this response and get only those files that are present under a specific directory ?</p>  <p>Somebody told me to get a json response instead of XML. What is the URL to get a JSON response?</p>  <p>Again, how to parse the JSON response?Any sample java program? If Sharepoint 2013 is used, what changes are required?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
