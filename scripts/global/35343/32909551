<p>I ran to an uncommon situation a few days back. All my intranet <strong>SharePoint site users are their permissions set to "Read</strong>".</p>  <p>As things aren't enough critical, afterward all my site collection administrators accounts are in full read permissions as well.</p>  <p>Using my favorite search engine, I have put a script together which will allow me to explicitly set owners and secondary owners to all my SharePoint Web site, as shown below:</p>  <pre><code>`$owner = Read-Host "Enter site collection owner username: " $second = Read-Host "Enter site collection secondary owner username: " $sites = Get-SPSite -Limit all foreach ($site in $sites) {     Write-Host Setting $site.url owner to $owner and secondary owner to $second     stsadm -o siteowner -url $site.url -ownerlogin $owner -secondarylogin $second } Write-Host "Done" $site.dispose()` </code></pre>  <p>This little script worked fine for all web site except for the more important one. The <code>failedspsite</code> throws an error : </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"actions on this web site has been blocked - Contact administrator to resolve the problem".</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have no logs whatsoever, to help me figure out where the problem lies, nor any events logged when the errors is thrown. So all administrator accounts cannot not edit user and group permissions in the <code>failedspsite</code> web applications. However, when checking administrator rights in Central Administration GUI I can see that the permissions level are "<em>Full Control</em>" .</p>  <p>My administration center and FWE server are running on the same box while the SQL server is on another server. It's a SharePoint 2010 SP1  environment with only one server in the farm.</p>
