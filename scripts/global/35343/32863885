<p>I have 2 Sharepoint sites which are mirror of each other, when i add a item in the old site it is added to new one and vice versa, i have a workflow set up on a list(in both the sites) which triggered an email when a item is created. But when i add a item i recieve only 1 email instaed of 2 email(1 from old and other from the mirror site). let me know if any more information is needed.</p>
