<p>I have two environments and authoring farm and a production farm using content deployment. The production farm is set up using host header site collections and the authoring is set up using path bases site collections. I am using SharePoint 2010 with a custom developed branding solution. The only thing the custom code does is use a module to add files to the style library in a folder structure for our designers.</p>  <p>Normally when not using a module to place assets and putting the style assets in a style library content deployment changes strips out the "/sites/sitecollection", but, When using a module the path does not get changed when content deployment bring the assets down and the css does not have the proper path to images which is the effect of my problem. To fix this I have had to go into the production site remove the assets, remove the assets in authoring and add them back in then run CD and the assets have the correct path.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this and/or run into a similar problem?</p>
