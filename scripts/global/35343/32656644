<p>I am here to give a simple workaround for SharePoint Email reminders. creating subscriptions in SSRS will do the trick. Here are the steps</p>  <p>1) Create a blank report in SSRS and name it something like "Sharepoint Subscriptions".</p>  <p>2) Create a subscription for that report.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Donot forget to <strong>uncheck</strong>  "Include report" and "Include Link" options in the subscription because here we are sending email to users and link is Sharepoint list/site but not anything related to report. Choose "Select Schedule" and you are done.</p></li> <li><p>The above solution worked like a charm for me. This is much simpler than Windows Task Scheduler and much much more simpler than writing code.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Note : The above workaround wont work if the requirement is to send reminder email workflows for particular item. In this case, i will create a view say (Expiration Date - 7days) and send users link to this view  following the above steps i mentioned so that users will have one link for all items that are going to expire in 7 days.</p>  <p>Please ignore this if you already know the workaround i mentioned.</p>
