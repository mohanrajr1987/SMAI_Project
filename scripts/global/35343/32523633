<p>I have a Visual Studio project in which I have created a Visual Webpart. In the user control I have a panel which I want to display in edit mode and hide in browse mode.</p>  <p>ASP.NET code snippet:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;asp:panel runat="server" ID="myControl"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>C# code snippet in user control code behind:</p>  <pre><code>protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e) {     base.OnPreRender(e);     WebPartManager wpm = WebPartManager.GetCurrentWebPartManager(this.Page);     if (wpm.DisplayMode == WebPartManager.BrowseDisplayMode)     {         myControl.Attributes.Add("style", "display: none");     }     else if (wpm.DisplayMode == WebPartManager.EditDisplayMode)     {         myControl.Attributes.Add("style", "display: block");     } } </code></pre>  <p>This works, but if I have two <strong>same</strong> webparts on <strong>same</strong> page and put one webpart is edit mode it shows the panel in both webparts. It seems the <code>OnPreRender</code> event code runs for both webparts on page.</p>  <p>I even tried writing code as <code>this.myControl.Attributes.Add("style", "display: block");</code> but it still didn't work.</p>  <p>I want the <code>OnPreRender</code> code to run only on its webpart and not modify the other webaprt on page. How can I resolve this? Is there any better (or preferred) way to do it?</p>  <p>NOTE: I need to use <code>display: none</code> because the panel would be accessed via JavaScript.</p>  <p><em>PS: This is a cross post from <a href="http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/q/153745/20540">here</a> as I did not get any satisfactory</em> answers.</p>
