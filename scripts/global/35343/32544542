<p>I have broken up a humongous page into several "bite-size" chunks. I want to present them, one at a time, to the user. After one page, they click an HTML button ("Next") and the previous Web Part or Content Editor Web Part is replaced by the next one.</p>  <p>From <a href="http://blog.mastykarz.nl/programmatically-adding-web-parts-rich-content-sharepoint-2010/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, I came up with some pseudcode (I don't know if there really is a SPLimitedWebPartManager.RemoveWebPart() method that I can call, as pseudocoded below, or how to get a reference to the currently (about-to-be-replaced) [Content Editor] Web Part, but this is the basic idea:</p>  <pre><code>using (SPSite site = new SPSite("http://~")) {     SPWeb web = site.RootWeb;     SPFile page = web.GetFile("Pages/Web_Form_Post_Travel_Expense.aspx");     page.CheckOut();      using (SPLimitedWebPartManager wpmgr = page.GetLimitedWebPartManager(PersonalizationScope.Shared))     {         XmlElement d = new XmlDocument().CreateElement("div");         d.InnerText = get         ContentEditorWebPart cewp = new ContentEditorWebPart         {             Content = d         };         ContentEditorWebPart currentCEWP = ?;         wpmgr.RemoveWebPart(currentCEWP);         wpmgr.AddWebPart(cewp, "Header", 0);     }      page.CheckIn(String.Empty); } </code></pre>  <p>Does this make sense? It seems kludgy or even downright weird to me, to be checking out the page, changing it, and checking it back in. </p>  <p>The only other thing I can think of at the moment is to put the entire shebang into one Web Part, but keep sections 2-6 hidden at first, and then successively show one segment (after hiding the previous one). IOW, this type of procedure:</p>  <pre><code>First Section shows All others hidden  User selects "Next" button  First section is hidden Second section shows, while all others remain hidden.  etc. </code></pre>  <p>Actually, both ideas seem at least a little wonky to me. Is one approach preferable, or is there a third way I haven't thought of that would be better than both?</p>
