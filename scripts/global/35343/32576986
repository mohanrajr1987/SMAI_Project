<p>have a custom application page that displays content only to users with Contribute permissions and above. For users with permissions below Contribute they get a message and the Quick Launch is disabled. The only links available in the quick launch are All Site Content and Recycle Bin. I've tested with a user with Read permissions and when All Site Content link is accessed it displays libraries within for which the user shouldn't have access to. In addition, the user can select a library and view contents within. How do I hide document libraries from a user group who has no access within All Site Content?</p>
