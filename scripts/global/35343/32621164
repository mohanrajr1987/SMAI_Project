<p>all data are stored in SharePoint access in a table format. I want to include the data as table format in the workflow emails so approvers don't need to click hyperlink to review the data in SharePoint. Does it have a function for this variable( access data) ? What is the name of this variable or action? where can I find it?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
