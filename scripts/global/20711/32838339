<p>let say I have a pointer to memory "pCurrentaddress", each access to the pointer have different type : uint8 , uint16, uint32 .</p>  <pre><code>typedef unsigned char       uint8;  typedef unsigned short int  uint16;  typedef unsigned long  int  uint32;  </code></pre>  <p>I have a vTYPE var with value 8,16,32 and i want to do casting according to vTYPE, I don't want to use switch-case, since it will cost me in code size.</p>  <pre><code>switch ( vTYPE )    {      case 32:                 (*((uint32*)pCurrentaddress))++;      break;      case 16:                  (*((uint16*)pCurrentaddress))++;      break;      case 8:                  (*((uint8*)pCurrentaddress))++;      break;   }    </code></pre>  <p>any better solution ? Tnx.</p>
