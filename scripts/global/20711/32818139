<p>I recently worked on a program that asked the user for his age in: years, months, and days.  </p>  <p>After receiving that input, it had to calculate and print </p>  <p>a) Age in Seconds (totalAgeInSecs) and </p>  <p>b) the Amount of Seconds left to live.  b is going to be based on the average lifespan in seconds <code>(avgLifeSpan = 250000000000l.  So secondsLeft = avgLifeSpan - totalAgeInSecs)</code>.  </p>  <p>Anyway,I was able to get the program to work utilizing (switch) statements for simplicity purposes and not having to write a bunch of if/else statements, but I feel that in doing that, I ended up writing repetitive lines, and I'd like to be able to not have to repeat the calculation or the print statements. </p>  <p>I know there are classes and arrays I can combine with loops, but for the sake of simplicity and logic understanding I didn't use them to understand the bareback bones and logic of this project in "English." haha.  </p>  <p>Anyway, check the code out below and let me know your thoughts on how to simplify the repetitive lines or better ways of approaching this. Thanks. </p>  <pre><code>import java.util.*;  public class AgeInSeconds {      static Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);     public static void main(String[] args) {          int totalNumDays, daysInMonth, daysToHours;
