<p>I have this while loop for a Blackjack Class:</p>  <pre><code>while (playerSum &lt; 21) {   System.out.println("Would you like another card?");   String input;   System.out.flush();   input = in.readLine();   if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")){     int card3;     Random r3 = new Random();     card3 = r3.nextInt(11 - 2 + 1) + 2;     switch (card3) {       case 2: System.out.println("You were dealt a Two"); break;       case 3: System.out.println("You were dealt a Three"); break;       case 4: System.out.println("You were dealt a Four"); break;       case 5: System.out.println("You were dealt a Five"); break;       case 6: System.out.println("You were dealt a Six"); break;       case 7: System.out.println("You were dealt a Seven"); break;       case 8: System.out.println("You were dealt a Eight"); break;       case 9: System.out.println("You were dealt a Nine"); break;       case 10: System.out.println("You were dealt a Ten"); break;       case 11: System.out.println("You were dealt a Ace"); break;     }     playerSum += card3;   } } </code></pre>  <p>I want the loop to end when the user inputs a "no" when asked if he would like another card. Currently If i input anything but "yes" it will continue to ask `Would you like another card?'. I understand why this is happening, but I have no idea how to fix it. Thanks in advance.</p>
