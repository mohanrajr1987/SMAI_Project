<p>This is a super dumbed down version of what I am doing, but imagine needing to perform multiple validations on an object within a switch statement. At any point in the validation we may decide that we do not want to continue working with the object.</p>  <p>The dumb example:</p>  <pre><code>var yummies = [   {name: 'apples', quantity: 3},   {name: 'apples', quantity: 4} ];  var purchases = [];  for (var i = 0; i &lt; yummies.length; i++) {   var yummy = yummies[i];   switch (yummy.name) {       case 'apples':         if (purchases.indexOf(yummy.name) &gt; -1) {           break;         }          //A ton of other code including, possibly other breaks          purchases.push(yummy.name);         break;   } } </code></pre>  <p>A <code>return</code> won't work as I still want to continue through the loop. I think I could go with a <code>continue</code> statement could work, but it looks really off seeing a <code>continue</code> in a <code>switch/case</code>.</p>  <p>Anyways, two <code>break</code>s in a single <code>case</code>. Any reason not to do it?</p>
