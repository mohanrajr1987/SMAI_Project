<p>I am trying to create a JavaScript Quiz. The function will check the user's input value. If it is correct; it will change the question.</p>  <p>Exact Code See <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Ltmjv488/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a></p>  <p>There are probably many more efficient and conventional ways to achieve what I am trying to do. Current issue is the function runs from the top every time it runs(obviously)</p>  <pre><code>function checkAnswer() {    var question = document.getElementById("ques").innerHTML;    var userAnswer = document.getElementById("answer").value;    if (userAnswer === "New York City") {      alert("correct!");     question = "What is the best college football team?";      if (userAnswer === "Alabama") {       alert("Correct!");       question = "Next question will go here and so on..."      }   } } </code></pre>
