<p>Is it possible to pass a variable to a switch statement, but conditionally! An example is below. I've tried something similar and it doesn't give any errors but then jumps straight to the default case regardless.</p>  <pre><code>var foo = 1; var bar = 2;  switch(foo == 1? foo : bar) {     //cases } </code></pre>  <p>What is being checked is irrelevant, just wondered if this is possible to do as I find this more succinct than declaring another variable and doing the check before the switch! Cheers.</p>
