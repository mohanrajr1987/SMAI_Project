<p>I'll be heading to some tutoring tomorrow, but I'd like to see if I can get an explanation here. Tried to ask a friend from my class, but explanation didn't make sense.</p>  <p>I'm supposed to take the user's input in the form of a structure that holds day, month, and year.</p>  <p>Here's all I really have right now:</p>  <pre><code>enum month {         JAN = 1, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUNE, JUL, AUG, SEPT,         OCT, NOV, DEC };  struct date_t {         unsigned short month;         unsigned short day;         unsigned short year; };  int main(void) {         date_t date; /*Allocates space for 3 unsigned shorts,         all for the date*/          printf("Please enter the month as an integer: \n");         scanf("%hu");          printf("Please enter the day as an integer: \n");         scanf("%hu");          printf("Please enter the year as an integer: \n");         scanf("%hu");          return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>So, here's my issue.</p>  <p>I could write an absolutely massive 12x12 (144 options) switch statement for every single case of month + zodiac sign combination, but that's just insanity. I really don't know what to do here. </p>  <p>The idea is if the user entered:</p>  <pre><code>8 (month)  28 (day)  12 (year) </code></pre>  <p>My program should output:</p>  <pre><code>August 28th, 2012, Virgo </code></pre>  <p>The main issue is that we haven't learned a way to store strings as a variable yet. That's past what we've done.</p>  <p>So I could make one switch statement with 12 cases (one for each month) and give each one a different "printf" statement starting with  ("Month %d, %d", date.day, date.year)</p>  <p>But then how do I do the zodiac sign? Also, that's 12 cases, that feels a little ridiculous.</p>  <p>My teacher suggested something about converting to Julian dates, and I almost understand how, but it seems like I'd need a really complicated for loop with a switch statement or a bunch of if/elses in there.</p>  <p>What in the world am I doing wrong? What is the simpler solution? </p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I managed to solve 2/3 of my problem. Now I'm running into a different one.</p>  <p>I need to deal with leap years (whatever that means) and find their sign. Gah. </p>  <p>EDIT 2: Figured it out! Wish I could show you all the code without making this post absolutely absurdly long. It works though! Very happy! Now I need to make a menu system for it. ;-;</p>
