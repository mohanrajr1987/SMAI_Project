<p>Suppose we read various characters. If we know that there will be more a's than g's, will this be more efficient </p>  <pre><code>for (int i = 0; buffer[i]; ++i) {      switch(buffer[i]) {         case 'a': //do something             break;          case 'g': //do something else            break;     } } </code></pre>  <p>than putting case g first and case a second?</p>  <p>Edit: I'm talking about time efficiency. I know that even it there was an improvement, it would be insignificant. I'm just curious.</p>
