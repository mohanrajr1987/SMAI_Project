<p>My code is telling me that the case 'A+' is an invalid character statement, but I need to be able to have case A+, A, A- and so on. What I'm wondering is: can I not have + or - inside the case value at all? and if so, is there any other way to identify what the user inputs into the console. I haven't been able to find an answer browsing around. Help is appreciated!</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;  public class GradeAdvice {  public static void main(String[] args) {       // User will input grade and program will give advice corresponding      // to that grade      // Prompt use for their grade     System.out.println("What was your grade on the midterm?");      char midtermGrade;      // Create an input object     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);     midtermGrade = input.next().charAt(0);      // Determine which advice to give based on grade     switch (midtermGrade)     {         case 'A+' :          case 'a+' : System.out.println("Continue doing what you have been doing, ask questions");              break;         default: System.out.println("This grade is invalid.");             break;  }     // Close input     input.close(); }  } </code></pre>
