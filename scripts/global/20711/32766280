<p>I am using Xcode7 and Swift programming language. I have created a new ViewController by dragging one to the Main.storyboard.</p>  <p>Right now I am facing a problem creating actions for the elements by holding Ctrl and dragging to the ViewController code view.</p>  <p>Have no idea Why it is not working. Maybe I have to create a secondViewController in a different way, but not dragging from available.</p>  <p>Thank you for the answers.</p>  <p>Here is a pic.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y0Gyq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y0Gyq.png" alt="Switcher Problem"></a></p>
