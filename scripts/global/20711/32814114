<p>I have an activity whose background is white, and I added a switchcompat, however when the switch is not active (off) the track is invisible. All that is visible is the thumb so it isn't obvious to the user that it's a switch at all. How can I make the switch's track visible when the switch is in the de-active position?</p>  <pre><code>                    &lt;android.support.v7.widget.SwitchCompat                         android:id="@+id/someswitchname"                         android:layout_width="wrap_content"                         android:layout_height="wrap_content"                         android:layout_alignParentRight="true"                         android:layout_alignParentEnd="true"                         /&gt; </code></pre>
