<p>I am trying to make a statement using switch case block and I want to know how thats possible with 2 variables?</p>  <p>I am supposed to add variables a and b if the case is 'double' but how would I do that if:</p>  <pre><code>a = [1 2 3 4] b = [2 1 3 1] ? </code></pre>  <p>So far I was thinking of doing this. </p>  <pre><code>a = [1 2 3 4] b = [2 1 3 1] c = class (a) d = class (b) e = c == d  switch blah        case 'double'        a + b        case 'logical'        a &amp; b        otherwise        disp ('None')   end </code></pre>  <p>and so on</p>  <p>Now I need a switch and case block to create a scenario where if our switch x has the case 'double' (class type) it will add variables a and b.</p>  <p>Any help will be much appreciated. Thank You</p>
