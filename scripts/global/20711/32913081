<p>I'm very new to PHP and I'm developing in the context of WordPress (with ACF). I'm creating a custom layout builder, I got it working but I want to make my code simpler. Right now is <code>14 cases</code> which load a <code>__.php</code> file if is applicable. Here is an example snippet:</p>  <pre><code>switch (get_row_layout()) {      case 'row_1' :         include ('template_row_1.php');     break;      case 'row_2' :         include ('template_row_2.php');     break;      case 'row_3' :         include ('template_row_3.php');     break;  }   </code></pre>  <p>Keep in mind I have 14 total cases (for now). They are named <code>row_1 --&gt; row_14</code> and the templates files are also named sequentially.</p>  <p>Is there any way of coding this without using so many switch cases? What if I include another <code>row</code> in ACF and I want to avoid coding another switch case. </p>  <p>I was thinking a counter which counts the total <code>layouts</code> inside the <code>builder</code> and switch case loops through them. Does this makes sense? I just want to make my code simpler and avoid the repetitiveness of the statements.  </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
