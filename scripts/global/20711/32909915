<p>The switch case is not printing output, nor is it running.</p>  <pre><code>package aircrack.ng;  import java.util.Scanner;  public class main {      public static void main(String[] args) {          Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);         infoMenu man = new infoMenu();         airMonMenu airmon = new airMonMenu();         boolean exit = false;         char optSelect = (char) System.in.read();          while (exit == false) {              System.out.println("\nPlease select which menu you'd like to      open...");             System.out.println("To view information about the tools included type: 'i' ");             System.out.println("To enter the airmon menu type: 'a'");             System.out.println("To exit simply type: 'e'\n");              switch (optSelect) {             case 'i':                 man.infoMenu();                 break;             case 'a':                 airmon.airMonMenu();                 break;             case 'e':                 exit = true;              }          }    }  } </code></pre>  <p>The ultimate goal here is to create a sort of menu to prompt for user input, then navigate to whichever menu the user selects. I want it all to continue to loop until the user inputs 'e', in which case it would break the loop.</p>
