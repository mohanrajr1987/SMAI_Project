<p>I'm using the jquery.datetimepicker.js from this page <a href="http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/" rel="nofollow">http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/</a> and I want to implement it in a specific way, so the user is able to choose the date starting 24 hours from a specific date. What I did so far is:</p>  <p>I created a new date object based on a string that I receive from server:</p>  <pre><code>var now = new Date("October 05, 2015 17:59:57"); </code></pre>  <p>I add 24 hours to this date:</p>  <pre><code>now.setHours(now.getHours() + 24); </code></pre>  <p>and later I put this logic:</p>  <pre><code>    var dd = now.getDate();     var mm = now.getMonth();     var yy = now.getFullYear();     var hh = now.getHours();      var isPM = now.getHours() &gt;= 12;     var isMidday = now.getHours() == 12;     var time = [now.getHours() - (isPM &amp;&amp; !isMidday ? 12 : 0),         now.getMinutes()].join(':') +             (isPM ? ' pm' : 'am');      var logic = function (currentDateTime) {     if (currentDateTime.getDate() == dd &amp;&amp; currentDateTime.getFullYear() == yy &amp;&amp; ((currentDateTime.getMonth()) == mm)) {             this.setOptions({                 formatTime: 'g:i A',                 format: 'd/m/Y h:i A',                 minDate: now,                 minTime: time             });     }         else{             this.setOptions({                 formatTime: 'g:i A',                 format: 'd/m/Y h:i A',                 minDate: now,                 minTime: '0:00 AM'             });         }       }; </code></pre>  <p>and it almost works fine. When user opens the datetimepicker, he sees that everyday until 6th of October is disabled (which is okay). When he chooses the 6th of October then he's able to choose time starting from 17:59:57 (24 fours after given time - which is fine). When the user clicks any day later on, e.g. 7th of October - he's able to choose any hour starting from 0:00 AM (which is cool too). </p>  <p>So when he chooses the date of 7th of October and hour of 0:00AM, he can switch back the date to 6th of October, and the time stays at 0:00AM - this is wrong, because it should jump into the available slot, which is for that day 17:59:57. </p>  <p>How can I fix it?</p>  <p>Here's my fiddle so far: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/b8o5cvdz/17/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/b8o5cvdz/17/</a></p>
