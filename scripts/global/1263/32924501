<p>I am trying to a get a unix_timestamp after doing a date_add to my database field but it still giving me the unix_timestamp of the original value not after the date_add.</p>  <p>Here is my query. </p>  <pre><code>SELECT data1.speed,UNIX_TIMESTAMP(Date_Add(data1.dateTimer , Interval '+08:00' hour_minute)) as dateTimer </code></pre>  <p>For example the dateTimer value is 2015-10-02 15:27:53 after date_add is 2015-10-02 23:27:53 but the unix_timestamp is giving me 1443799673 which refers to 2015-10-02 15:27:53. I even tried the CONVERT_TZ function its still the same.</p>
