<p>Why I can apply that code to other form .cs</p>  <pre><code>string dt = day + "/" + month + "/" + year; DateTime newDate = DateTime.ParseExact(dt, "dd/MM/yyyy", null); </code></pre>  <p>It always show error this </p>  <blockquote>   <p>String was not recognized as a valid DateTime.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It have to change like this</p>  <pre><code>"dd/MM/yyyy"  --&gt;   "d/M/yyyy" </code></pre>  <p>But in other form .cs, that code works. Don't need to change that string</p>
