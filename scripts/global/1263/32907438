<p>I am getting data from an external MySQL table with a created_field of type timestamp with example data in the following format '2015-10-01 07:45:22'</p>  <p>I then want to convert this into a PHP DateTime Object for persisting into a database using Doctrine ORM.</p>  <p>The weird thing is, whatever I try to do, the date being saved ends up being the current date and not the timestamp in the database.</p>  <p>Here's what I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>$date = \DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s',$result['created_at']); </code></pre>  <p>And </p>  <pre><code>$date = new \DateTime($result['created_at']); </code></pre>  <p>Maybe I am tired but can't believe I cannot figure this out! Someone please help</p>
