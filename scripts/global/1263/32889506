<p>I am working on a simple SSRS report. So simple it's not worth going into. The query is so simple. Again so simple.</p>  <p>The issue that I am experiencing is that there is a big performance drop in management studio based on the use of a DATETIME variable or the ODBC literal.</p>  <p>So then this query </p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @StartDate AS DATETIME = '2015-09-15' DECLARE @EndDate AS DATETIME = '2015-10-01' SELECT *  FROM dbo.HEADER  WHERE TRANSDATE BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate </code></pre>  <p>Performs terribly... like 30 seconds on not that many records.</p>  <p>And then this query...</p>  <pre><code>SELECT *  FROM dbo.HEADER  WHERE TRANSDATE BETWEEN {ts '2015-09-15 00:00:00.00'} AND {ts '2015-10-01 00:00:00.00'} </code></pre>  <p>Runs very quickly... like 0 seconds.</p>  <p>Can anyone shed some light on this behavior for me? In my mind SQL server would treat them both the same, but clearly I am mistaken.</p>
