<p>I have a string with a date in UTC and tzinfo</p>  <pre><code>"Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:02:01 +0200" </code></pre>  <p>How can I do to convert it to my local time so it outputs</p>  <pre><code>"2015-10-02 02:02:01" </code></pre>  <p>I tried</p>  <pre><code>parser.parse("Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:02:01 +0200") </code></pre>  <p>but I can't find a way to sum this tzinfo to the time to get my local time.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <p>Edit: The question is diferent as It includes time diference in the given string and the point is to add or sutract this time diference that sometimes requires to change the date as in the provided example.</p>
