<p>I'm trying to compare two dates in javascript which are formatted differently. Namely:</p>  <p>2015-09-30T00:00:00 and 9/30/2015 12:00:00 AM</p>  <p>The former is UTC and the latter is not in UTC format. Logically, I am referring to the same date/time here but I can't come up with a way to compare them that will return true. Creating a new Date object with each ends up with different results (due to UTC offset with my local time zone).</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
