<p>I am trying to get a string out of a <code>DateTime</code> object using the following C# code on .NET 4.5:</p>  <pre><code>var dateTime = new DateTime(2015, 9, 30); var str = dateTime.ToString("M/d/yyyy");  Console.WriteLine(str); </code></pre>  <p>Under normal circumstances, the output of this code is 9/30/2015, as expected.</p>  <p>However, if I go to Control Panel, Region and Language and change the "Short date" pattern for US English to "dd-MMM-yy", the code above will suddenly display 9-30-2015!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bppOv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bppOv.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Does anyone know why this is happening and how it can fixed / worked around? Note, for instance, that if i choose in Region and Language another short date pattern such as "M/d/yy", the code works correctly.</p>
