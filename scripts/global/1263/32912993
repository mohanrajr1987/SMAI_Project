<p>I am trying to display a datetime record created from a string. The code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>$dt = new DateTime('2015-10-02 13:40:51.372773-04'); echo $dt-&gt;format('M d, Y \a\t h:ma'); </code></pre>  <p>The output of this is:</p>  <pre><code>Oct 02, 2015 at 01:10pm </code></pre>  <p>The minutes are incorrect. I have tried altering the minutes in the original string, and the output is always 10. Any idea what's going on?</p>
