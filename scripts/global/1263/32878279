<p>I am passing some dummy parameters via HHTP client postman like so:</p>  <pre><code>{"resourceId": "5293e7fb-ffnksadjfn-7b-abfr185fsa6b", "count": "1", "timeFrom": "2016-01-15T01:35:30.314Z", "timeTo": "2016-01-15T01:35:30.314Z", "sourceId": "card_16m7TaFYUmuhEmVRMoEwnaXa", "notes":"fmaksf"} </code></pre>  <p>But I am getting error:</p>  <pre><code>"data": "Reservation duration has to be positive." </code></pre>  <p>The timeFrom and timeTo have to be in that unicode format. How can I add time to the timeTo parameter? I cannot find what each of the characters stands for. It has to only add and hour or two it cannot add days otherwise I will get a different errror. How can I just add one hour to the timeFrom unicode and place that in the unicode for timeTo to make this pass? I am trying to test other functionality but have to get past this first.</p>
