<p>I'm copying data from a SQLServer2012 database to a SQLServer2014 database using <code>Tasks&gt;&gt;Generate scripts...</code> and selecting <code>Data only</code> in the Advanced Options.</p>  <p>The problem appears when I try to execute the resulting script in the SQLServer2014 database. The error is: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>The conversion of a nvarchar data type to a datetime data type   resulted in an out-of-range</p> </blockquote>  <p>I know that's probably because the databases have different cultures and the inserts which the first server are generating:</p>  <pre><code>INSERT [dbo].[CollectionSet] ([Id], [CreationDate], [Active], [MenuOrder]) VALUES (1, CAST(N'2015-09-18 00:00:00.000' AS DateTime), 1, 1) </code></pre>  <p>do not work in the second server.</p>  <p>So, my question is: How can I generate a script with the correct date format so it can work on the second server?</p>  <p>PD: I have no access to Management Studio on the destination server.</p>
