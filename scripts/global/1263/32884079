<p>i have a website developed in asp.net 4 and sql server 2008 R2. The problem is very complicated. I have a field in db with datatime offset UTC (ex. 2015-09-30 18:24:53.1498113 +02:00). Randomly (i think when application pool restart) this value return corrupt after query in .net like this: 30/09/2015 18:21:00 +02:00 +02:00 Time offset repeated 2 times!</p>  <p>So, when i parse the date in c# obviously i receive an error "String was not recognized as a valid DateTime".</p>  <p>If i recycle pool applcation page work fine</p>  <p>Why? It's a bug? Have you ever seen similar problem?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot</p>
