<p>It may look trivial but I didn't find a clear and consistent way in javascript to format a datetime field in a way that is convient for displaying year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds like :</p>  <pre><code>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm-ss' </code></pre>  <p>For example : </p>  <pre><code>var dt=new Date(linux_time_value) dt.toString('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm-ss');            OR dt.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm-ss'); </code></pre>  <p>Has anyone any idea? Maybe there are many workarounds with the help of splitting the date. But what I want is if there are formats that give me more freedom. For example if I want to display UTC or EET or other formats with offset times</p>
