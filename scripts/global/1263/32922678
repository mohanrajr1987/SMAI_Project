<p>Using PHP, I'd like to get the dates for specific weekdays within a given number of weeks. For example, I want to get the dates for Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10 weeks.</p>  <p>The pseudo code for what I want is like this:</p>  <pre><code>function (monday, wednesday, friday, 10) {      // 10 is week numbers      week1 5,7,9 oct 2015     week2  12,14,16 oct 2015      ...     week10 } </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>i write a solution for this. Thanks for all answers.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;? $dates = array(); $i = 0;  while(true) {     $i++;      $time = strtotime("+$i days");     $dayOfWeek = date('w', $time);      if(       /*     0-sun     1-mon***     2-tue     3-wed***     4-thu     5-fri***     6-sat     */     ($dayOfWeek == 0) or     ($dayOfWeek == 2) or     ($dayOfWeek == 4) or      ($dayOfWeek == 6)         ) {         continue;     }      $dates[] = date('Y-m-d', $time);      if( count($dates) &gt; 30 ) {         break;     }      echo json_encode($dates );  }  ?&gt; </code></pre>
