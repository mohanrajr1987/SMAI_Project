<p>I was under the impression that <code>alloc</code> in Objective-C (when we invoke <code>[anyObject alloc]</code> is actually implementing C function <code>malloc</code> and the memory getting allocated in heap, but could not find anywhere the answer for this.</p>  <p>Also, while searching for <code>alloc</code>, I found <code>alloca</code> which allocates memory in stack. If I am not wrong, <code>alloc</code> allocates memory in heap to create objects. </p>  <p>So, what is the difference between <code>alloc</code> and <code>malloc</code> (and <code>alloca</code>)? Can anyone please summarize?</p>
