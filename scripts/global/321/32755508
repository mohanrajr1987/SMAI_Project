<p>I know the issue is related to memory allocations, but I get it in only iOS 9, XCode 7. In XCode 6.4, iOS 8.4, it works just perfect, no issue at all at any ways. In iOS 9, XCode 7, it just crashes very frequently giving this error.</p>  <p><code>malloc: *** mach_vm_map(size=1048576) failed (error code=3) *** error: can't allocate region securely *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug</code></p>  <p>Any suggestions? I am working on memory issues, but I wonder if there were too many memory issues, then why did it work in iOS 8.4 and not in iOS 9?</p>  <p>Also, I get all my UI whited out! Like navigation bar has no title, custom tabbar(RDVTabBar) is not visible, however, other view controller is there (it responds to the touch events, you can tap that area and the button positioned in that area acts!).</p>  <p>P.S. I don't get memory warning ever, neither <code>applicationWillTerminate:</code> method is being called!</p>  <p>Update: I found that this issue occurs in iPhone 5 and 4s only! (Non-64bit devices!)</p>  <p>Update 2: When the crash happens, I try to print one of the object and to print it, I again get the same error in debug mode: <code>malloc: *** mach_vm_map(size=1048576) failed (error code=3) *** error: can't allocate region securely *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug</code>.</p>
