<p>Read from the book that when a process is started, its private process address space is created</p>  <p>Let's say it is from 0x0 to 0xMAX</p>  <p>And one part of the space is the heap, and we wrote a for loop to coontinue malloc (1k date) until it returns false. It allocated 3GB date.</p>  <p>So, question, if 0x0 to 0xMAX is allocated in the beginning, it means 0x0 to 0xMAX is larger than 3GB (since there are stack, control...) since the beginning?</p>  <p>If one process can take more than 3GB at the beginning, it must be I understand it wrong. </p>  <p>Can anyone explain how this 0x0 - 0xMAX is stored in the begging? </p>
