<p>Suppose I have a library compiled with compiler A.  It allocates memory using <code>malloc()</code> and leaves it to me to <code>free()</code> it.  It provides no special free function.</p>  <p>Can I compile my program (that uses this library) with compiler B?  Or do I have to worry that one compiler's (standard library's) <code>malloc</code> is incompatible with the other's <code>free</code>?</p>  <p>In addition to the general question I would also like to know the answer specifically for these compilers: system clang on OS X with MacPorts' gcc 4.9 or 5.</p>
