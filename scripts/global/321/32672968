<p>I'm writing a function that reads data from a text file and returns it in an int array. It seems for some lines of the text file, the function returns an array of zeros.</p>  <p>The strange thing is the array is filled with values right before it is returned. However when it is received by my other function all the values have been replaced with zeroes.</p>  <p>Below is a simplified version of what I'm trying to do:</p>  <pre><code>int *trip = malloc(4 * sizeof(int)); //Memory for 4 int pointers char tripID[250]; //Temp array to build tripID string char routeID[250]; //Temp array to build routeID string char shapeID[250]; //Temp array to build shapeID string char serviceID[250]; //Temp array to build serviceID string  -Loop that fills each char array-  //Assign and convert to ints trip[0] = atoi(tripID); trip[1] = atoi(routeID); trip[2] = atoi(shapeID); trip[3] = atoi(serviceID); return trip; </code></pre>  <p>Now prior to returning the array was filled with values e.g. [1843,324252,52342,32] But when it was returned to this variable</p>  <pre><code>int *formattedLine = getTripData(line); </code></pre>  <p>It suddenly became [0,0,0,0] I have debugged it line by line and cannot find the issue.</p>
