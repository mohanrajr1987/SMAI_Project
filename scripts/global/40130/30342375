<p>i am getting an error while loading flex project on eclipse luna-java. Please help to solve this problem. I googled for rectify but i failed. a problem occurred when opening project"zz". Try quitting and restarting the application. If the problem persists you might be using an unsupported project version, or your project files might be corrupted.</p>
