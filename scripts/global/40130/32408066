<p>My problem may be a little too specific but I figured I'd ask.</p>  <p>I am interested in working with <a href="https://github.com/jozefchutka/YCanvas" rel="nofollow">YCanvas</a> an <em>"open source 2D tile renderer library written in ActionScript 3"</em> hosted on Github. I am not very experienced in building projects like this with lots of shared libs. Maybe someone can point out what I am missing.</p>  <ol> <li><p>I created a new workspace in Flash Builder </p></li> <li><p>Using the "import..." command, I connected to Github and import YCanvas into the new workspace </p></li> <li>I already have Flex 4.6 installed but I checked the settings and they seem fine.</li> <li>When I try to build one of the example projects, the app hangs or I get an error <code>unable to open YCanvasLibrary.swc</code>. I check the <code>bin</code> directory for <code>YCanvasLibrary</code> â€“ nothing there.</li> </ol>  <p>I've tried to build <code>YCanvasLibrary</code> directly. Did a "clean" and then build but still no .swc.</p>  <p>Am I missing a step or a setting? I can't tell if I am doing something wrong or if the YCanvas project is assuming I know something that I don't, or it is set up badly. There are no docs at all.</p>  <p><strong>So the question is:</strong> How do I force the <code>YCanvasLibrary</code> to get built? It is not getting built when I try to build the "ApplicationMap" app (which links to it), or when I try to build it directly.</p>  <p>This is what the Flash Builder workspace directory looks like.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/65qwa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/65qwa.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
