<p>I am trying to implement a simple "zoom" function in a map presentation type app. The user interacts with a <code>NumericStepper</code> to dial in a scale value and I then use that value to set the <code>scaleX</code> and <code>scaleY</code> properties of my map sprite. The parent of the map sprite has a <code>scrollRect</code> defined so the map is cropped as it scales. That all seems to work fine.</p>  <p>Naturally when I change the scale, the visible content shifts as the sprite becomes larger or smaller. I would like to keep the content in relatively the same screen location. I've taken a first pass at it below but it's not quite right. </p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Am I on the right track here thinking that I can determine how much to shift the x/y by comparing the change in the width/height of the sprite after scaling? <em>(as I write this I am thinking I can determine the center of the sprite before scaling, then reposition it so it stays centered over that point. Hmm. . .).</em></p>  <pre><code>        protected function scaleStepper_changeHandler(event:Event):void         {             var cX:Number = wrapper.x + (wrapper.width /2);             var cY:Number = wrapper.y + (wrapper.height /2);              wrapper.scaleX = scaleStepper.value;             wrapper.scaleY = scaleStepper.value;              wrapper.x = cX - (wrapper.width /2);             wrapper.y = cY - (wrapper.height /2);          } </code></pre>
