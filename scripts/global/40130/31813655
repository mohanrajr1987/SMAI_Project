<p>I just installed Windows 10 and can no longer debug in Flash Builder 10.  I can't seem to get the debug version of Flash installed in Chrome and there's no debugger on Adobe's site for Win10.   I don't really care which browser I use to debug but I can't get any to work.   I'd appreciate any suggestions.</p>
