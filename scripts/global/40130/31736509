<p>I am using flex TabNavigator to display few datagrids. Each datagrid have same structure but populated with different dataProvider. Currently I am using following method to check which datagrid or an element from a tab was clicked.</p>  <p>if(TabNavigator.selectedIndex == 0){</p>  <p>}else if(TabNavigator.selectedIndex == 1){</p>  <p>} ... else if(TabNavigator.selectedIndex == 4){</p>  <p>}</p>  <p>My question is is there an efficient way to check this? Is there anyway I can organize similar structure in to one property? Thank you.</p>
