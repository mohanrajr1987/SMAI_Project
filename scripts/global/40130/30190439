<p>Would anyone know a method (or trick) to force a rendering update to an MX ProgressBar in <code>manual</code> mode when using <code>setProgress</code>?</p>  <p>I have a situation with a block of code containing a couple of <code>for</code> loops which take a bit of time to complete. It would be tedious to unwrap this code to generate events, etc. </p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>Let me expand on this with a bit of pseudo code. I want to update the progress bar during operations on the contents of an array. THe <code>for</code> loops blocks so the screen isn't updating. I've tried <code>validateNow()</code> but that had no effect.</p>  <p>Is there some non-convoluted way I can either unwrap the <code>for</code> loop or use AS3's event model to update a progress bar? (I'm more accustomed to multi-threaded environments where this sort of task is trivial).</p>  <pre><code>   private function doSomeWork():void {        progressBar.visible = true;         for(var n = 0; n &lt; myArray.length; n++){              progressBar.setProgress(n, myArray.length);             progressBar.label = "Hello World " + n;             progressBar.validateNow(); // this has no apparent effect              var ba:ByteArray = someDummyFunction(myArray[i]);             someOtherFunction(ba);         }           progressBar.visible = false;       } </code></pre>
