<p>I have a flex titleWindow which has two states( employee &amp; reporting). I'm utilizing the same component in the application and simply want to call the component by a selected state depending on where in the application its called. Here is my code thus far:</p>  <pre><code>//function to call assignment removal window.             private function removeAssignmentWindowFunc():void{                 //call assignment removal window                 var newAssignmentRemovalWindow:assignmentDelete = PopUpManager.createPopUp(this, assignmentDelete, true) as assignmentDelete;                 PopUpManager.centerPopUp(newAssignmentRemovalWindow);             } </code></pre>  <p>Within this function I want to call the currentState equal to Reporting so when this function calls the TitleWindow component, it opens up on the reporting state rather than the default state. How can I achieve that?</p>
