<p>I'm using the s:WindowedApplication menu to add my own custom mx:NativeMenu to the application. This works fine but it overwrites the Edit menu (cut, copy, paste, selectAll, delete). Is there an easy way to restore the default Edit menu? </p>  <p>I know I can recreate it and I've tried but the key bindings are lost and I can't test them on a Windows machine (I'm on a Mac at the moment). I'm thinking it would be best to restore the default menu if it's possible. </p>
