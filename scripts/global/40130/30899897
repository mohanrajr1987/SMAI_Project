<pre><code>*** Security Sandbox Violation *** SecurityDomain 'file:///Users/Bluebird/Desktop/Demo/Project/Level_01 /Background.png' tried to access incompatible context 'app:/project.swf' </code></pre>  <p>I understand that these "security" alerts are difficult to track down and even more difficult with scant information but I thought I would ask.</p>  <p>I have a large Flex/AIR desktop project where the user can select images off their local drive and collage them. There are also some <code>swfs</code> provided which they can use as "stamps". I am getting the error below when stamps are added to the app and clicked – the stamps have eventListeners attached – but the error does not reference the stamp (swf) but instead it references the background image.</p>  <p>The background image is a <code>Spark Image</code> defined in MXML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;s:Image id="backgroundImage" x="{renderX}" y="{renderY}"           width="{renderWidth}" height="{renderHeight}"           smooth="true" smoothingQuality="high" scaleMode="stretch"           complete="backgroundImage_completeHandler(event)" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The <code>complete</code> function does nothing important. The <code>source</code> property for the image is defined once the user has selected a local image:</p>  <pre><code>      backgroundImage.source = userFile.url </code></pre>  <p>I don't see anywhere to provide a <code>loaderContext</code>for the <code>Image</code> component (one solution usually suggested for "security" errors). Also, the backgroundImage component has no eventListeners – so I am completely baffled why it is throwing an error.</p>  <p>I've set the Flex compiler option to <code>-use-network = false</code> since this is just a desktop app and that is another commonly suggested "security" fix. I am also loading the "stamp" swfs through the trick of loading them as a <code>byteArray</code> first – another commonly suggested "security" fix. </p>  <p>Can someone help me hate Flash a little less? </p>
