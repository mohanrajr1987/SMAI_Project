<p>My AIR app is showing Allow Application to Check for Updates everytime it's opened? I'm using the ApplicationUpdater and ApplicationUpdaterUI classes and calling:  </p>  <pre><code>updaterUI.initialize();  </code></pre>  <p>at startup and then on UpdateEvent.INITIALIZED I call: </p>  <pre><code>updaterUI.checkNow(); </code></pre>  <p>Is this correct? </p>  <p>Here is the screen I see: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xp8nX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xp8nX.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>BTW I click the "Check for Updates" button and it then says, "No updates available". I would think that on the next time it opens it would check in the background and only pop up a window when an update is available. This is how it seems to work on other AIR apps. </p>
