<p>How do I search for an exact match to a phrase or word in Flash Builder's search tool?</p>  <p>For example, in my project I have a class with a function named "removeEvent". If I search on it, I get all instances where "removeEventListener" is used and of course that is not helpful.</p>  <p>I have searched on the web but only come up with similarly unhelpful false hits (how ironic).</p>  <p>It appears I can use regex but I don't know how to do that and trying <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5752852/840992">this answer</a> to a regex question was no help</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BFszd.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
