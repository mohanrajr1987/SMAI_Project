<p>I'm wiring up a flex registration form, and need to setup a minimum age for registration of a new user of 16 years old. I see the flex calendar component has the option for date ranges and minimum year, but I didn't readily see anything in the attributes for setting a required parameter for selected to be at least 16 years prior to today's date. </p>  <p>What is a good way to setup a calendar validation condition for D.O.B. required to be at least 16 years prior to today?</p>
