<p>I found some behavior in FLex that I'm not familiar with and can't figure out WHY it's happening. Can anyone explain? I have a CustomComponent whose base component is a Spark Panel. Here is an example:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;s:Panel title="hello world panel"&gt;     &lt;s:Label text="hello world" /&gt;     &lt;s:controlBarContent&gt;         &lt;s:Button label="hello world button" /&gt;     &lt;/s:controlBarContent&gt; &lt;/s:Panel&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In another class I use the new operator to create a new CustomComponent and add it to an mx Canvas that is already on the stage. When this happens, the CustomComponent shows up, I can see the the title bar and the title, I can see the button in the controlBarContent, but I can't see the content (the Label).</p>  <p>If I take the code from my custom component (the Panel portion) and just put it directly in the Canvas that I was adding it to then it works just fine! </p>  <p>Also, if I make my CustomComponent have a base of Canvas and then put my panel in there it also works just fine!</p>  <pre><code>&lt;mx:Canvas&gt;     &lt;s:Panel title="hello world panel"&gt;         &lt;s:Label text="hello world" /&gt;         &lt;s:controlBarContent&gt;             &lt;s:Button label="hello world button" /&gt;         &lt;/s:controlBarContent&gt;     &lt;/s:Panel&gt; &lt;/mx:Canvas&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is this a possible bug in flex? Or is this the way it is supposed to work and if it is supposed to work this way can anyone enlighten me to as why?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
