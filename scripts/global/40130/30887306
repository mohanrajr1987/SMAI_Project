<p>Is there a class in AS3 or Flex that tells you the type of protocol a URI or URL is part of? I was sure there was a class that broke a URL into various parts and grouped it into usable data. </p>  <p>For example, if the URL is, "mailTo" it would return "mail" protocol. Or if the URL is "<a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a>" it would return "url" protocol. Something along those lines. </p>
