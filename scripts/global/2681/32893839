<p>We have a VPC setup on Amazon S3 where we have various application delivery web servers that communicate with a cluster of NCache in-memory caching servers, and a database server.</p>  <p>Trying to determine the bottleneck and how to properly scale; would it be possible and a good idea to create multiple NICs per instance and segment them so that a (or load balanced cluster) of NIC(s) on the web servers are load balanced, and then another dedicated NIC for traffic to the cache servers network, and another for the database.</p>  <p>Right now from monitoring on AWS, our cache servers are seeing around 600Mbps in and 1.5Gbps out, with very minimal load.</p>
