<p>Android has a simple facility for creating thumbnails from videos</p>  <pre><code>ThumbnailUtils.createVideoThumbnail(uri.getPath(), MediaStore.Images.Thumbnails.MINI_KIND); </code></pre>  <p>So if I have a Youtube style app that must display a ListView of Videos to a user, which is more efficient?</p>  <ol> <li><p>Use ThumbnailUtils to generate the thumbnails each and every time (well, I am using Picasso and so there is a temporary cache)?</p></li> <li><p>Keep the thumbnails on my server and load them each and every time ( again, Picasso will keep a local cache naturally)</p></li> </ol>  <p>As far as battery life is concerned I don't know how much of a problem antenna will be, since you need network to watch videos. But who knows? Thanks for any input.</p>  <p>Also my server is not free, but I figure a video is so much larger than a thumbnail that storage is probably not an issue. (I am considering everything in asking the question. I am using Cloudinary for video storage with a Parse database fyi).</p>  <p>Ultimately my main concern is smooth user experience as the ListView loads.</p>
