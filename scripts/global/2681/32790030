<p>I've created a user-to-user bipartite network in rstudio, which includes several attributes:</p>  <pre><code>g2 &lt;- bipartite_projection(g, which=FALSE) summary(g2) IGRAPH UNW- 147 5070 --  + attr: id (v/c), loc (v/c), name (v/c), type (v/n), weight (e/n) </code></pre>  <p>I want to remove irrelevant attributes and end up with a network whose summary only includes id and weight.</p>  <p>I've tried the following:</p>  <pre><code>g3 &lt;- graph.edgelist(cbind(edge.df$id, edge.df$vid), directed=FALSE) E(g3)$weight &lt;- E(g2)$weight  for (v in V(g3)) {     name &lt;- get.vertex.attribute(g2, "id")     if (length(name) !=0)     {         g3 &lt;- set.vertex.attribute(g3, "id", v, name)     } }  summary(g3) IGRAPH UNW- 62416 962 --  + attr: id (v/c), weight (e/n) </code></pre>  <p>The result does show id and weight, but I don't think this is the network that I'm looking for since it now includes 62416 nodes and 962 edges, as opposed to the original 147 nodes and 5070 edges.</p>
