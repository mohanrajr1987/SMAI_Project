<p>After testing some iOS apps communicating with OSX apps over HTTP, I recognized sometime communication problems. The communication is done over a HTTP-server and -clients. In former times it worked great, but after the introduction of OSX 10.10 I often recognized such problems. Mostly updating from an older iOS/OSX to the newest version resolved these problems.</p>  <p>Does anyone knows the reason for this problem? Does Apple improves the networking reliability for several times? Nothing was change on these apps in that time.</p>
