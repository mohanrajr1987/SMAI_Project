<p>I am trying to use the VpnService API to capture packets (on Android 4.4). I've been following an example at:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/06/android-vpn-service/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/06/android-vpn-service/</a> </p>  <p>I establish the vpn connection using a builder, which is configured using the following code (which is borrowed from the ToyVPN sample, as I'm sure many of you will recognize):</p>  <pre><code>        // Configure a builder while parsing the parameters.     Builder builder = new Builder();     builder.setMtu(1500);     builder.addAddress("192.168.0.1", 24);     builder.addRoute("0.0.0.0", 0);     try {         mInterface.close();     } catch (Exception e) {         // ignore     }      mInterface = builder.establish(); </code></pre>  <p>The general concept is that with VpnService, I am able to get outbound packets and log them. Then I open a Socket to the original destination and forward the packets. When the response comes, it will be via the Socket that was opened.</p>  <p>So my question is, what happens when an IP address sends me a packet before I've opened a Socket to that address? I'm guessing that either it bypasses the VPN and arrives as normal, or is dropped entirely (probably the former?). Any insight is appreciated.</p>
