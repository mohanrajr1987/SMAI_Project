<p>Today many of the routers do not forward inbound traffic from internet to LAN devices by default. </p>  <p>What are the best standards to use for my application to set up a dynamic inbound port-forwarding automatically for my services (UDP and/or TCP)?</p>  <p>I'm looking for solution like UPnP or whatever. It'd also need to be backwards compatible with old routers/modem.</p>  <p>P.S. How do software like utorrend implement this?</p>
