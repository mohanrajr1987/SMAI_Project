<p>The purpose of this application would be to figure out the network performance of uplinks. I checked owamp <a href="http://software.internet2.edu/owamp/manpages.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> and some other programs but is they so complicated for little work. Could you please suggest?? Also tell me about the disadvantages and advantages over another language?</p>  <p>And this question is not about opinion as I want to choose the best suibale language which can run fast in runtime, consume less CPU and Memory Utilization.</p>
