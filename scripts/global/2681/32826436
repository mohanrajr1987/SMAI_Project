<p>I am trying to think of a way to generate TCP traffic in Scapy at a specific rate. Say I want to generate traffic at 50 Mbps for 5 min and that I have a packet of size 4kb. I can figure out the number of packets N I need to send (50Mbps/4kb) per second. How much should I wait before the send the next N packets?</p>  <p>Also, is this the best way to generate packets at a specific rate?</p>
