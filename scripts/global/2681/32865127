<p>I'm following the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/getting-started/run-on-compute-engine?hl=en" rel="nofollow">bookshelf app tutorial</a>. I was able to deploy the app and have my server running and connect it to my mongodb instance. Everything was working fine. When I tried to deploy my own app, I followed all the steps, I was able to get my code into the cloud repository. I started up a linux debian VM and supplied it the startup script I found in the tutorial but when I went to the address</p>  <pre><code>http://&lt;your-instance-ip&gt;:8080 </code></pre>  <p>I WASN'T ABLE TO CONNECT TO MY APPLICATION. I SSHd into my instance and was able to navigate to the directory in which my file was saved, and I manually entered the command</p>  <pre><code>node app.js </code></pre>  <p>I immedietly got the console log that my application is running on port 8080. But after 10 minutes, I got an error that my application wasn't able to connect to the mongodb instance. I use mongoose to connect to mongodb whereas in the tutorial they used MongoClient. HERE IS MY CODE: </p>  <pre><code>mongoose.connect('mongodb://***.***.***.***:27017/myappdatabase'); var db = mongoose.connection; db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));  db.once('open', function(callback) {     console.log("connected to mongodb..."); }); </code></pre>  <p>and here is the tutorial code:</p>  <pre><code>MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {   if (err) {     console.log(err);     return cb(err);   }   collection = db.collection(collectionName);   cb(null, collection); }); </code></pre>  <p>WHERE url IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE URL IN MONGOOSE.CONNECT(); </p>  <p>I'm pretty sure this is the only problem. When the VM spins up, it executes my app.js file and when it's not able to connect to mongodb, my server collapses.</p>
