<p>I would like to make a modified sankey plot in R, where it is possible to have several edges between nodes, to identify different paths. It is a bit hard to explain so I made sample picture in ppt :)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BI266.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BI266.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I know it is ugly :) but my point is that I would like to be able to make to edges between A and B1, and clearly indicate which edge belongs to the path going to C1 and C2.</p>  <p>I tried sankeyPlot from the rCharts-packages, however I could only get two columns of nodes.</p>  <p>I have also tried the riverplot-packages, but here I can not make two edges between the same nodes. </p>
