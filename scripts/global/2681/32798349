<p>I am trying to make a simple <code>TCP</code> chat program, and I want the user to be able to start the program, then be able to enter a specific <code>ip</code> to connect to, and then disconnect from that specific server, and then connect to another after that. </p>  <p>I know that the client is connected once it runs <code>client.connect(timeout, ip, port)</code>, but the only way I know of to disconnect the client from the server is by exiting the program. </p>  <p>Is there any way to do this?</p>
