<p>Situation - I have learnt many algorithms like - Sliding window protocol, leaky bucket, and token bucket code. Now, I want to write these algorithms. I know basic kernel programming - C, C++, and python. </p>  <p>Desire - I want to write this algorithm and change some parts to improve the throughput. Also, I want my code to be available for others. Basically, I don't want just bookish knowledge. I want to implement what I have learnt in the real sense.</p>  <p>Question -  1. Do I need to implement this algorithm only in Linux Kernel ?</p>  <ol start="2"> <li><p>If so, what example I can pickup to implement. I can write only loadable module. What example is a good example related to loadable module to implement leaky bucket?</p></li> <li><p>If 1 and 2 are not valid, then can I write this algorithm in python. But, how python will work on the lower level. As per my understanding, python will work on the application layer. However, I want to write a code, which will run in the L2, or L3 of TCP/IP. Does it make sense if I write program on application layer? Since, there will be a performance hit, if I write such algorithm on the application layer. Am I correct here? </p></li> </ol>
