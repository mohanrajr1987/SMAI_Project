<p>I have got all nic's by <code>NetworkInterface.GetAllnetworkInterfaces();</code>  also I have some vpn interfaces in .pbk file.</p>  <pre><code>using DotRas; ...  string path = System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData) +                           @"\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\rasphone.pbk";              RasPhoneBook pbk = new RasPhoneBook();             pbk.Open(path);              foreach (RasEntry entry in pbk.Entries)                System.Console.WriteLine((entry.Name)); </code></pre>  <p>I have already parsed them, so I have all to create vpn connection. The question is how to SET one of this vpn connections as only "Upped" interface - In other words, how to route all the traffic across the vpn connection.</p>  <p>PS: to clear the question - I have setup a PPTP connection and I also have default internet connection. How to switch all my traffic to my VPN connection programmatically? </p>  <p>I could disable all network interfaces that I got from <code>NetworkInterface.GetAllnetworkInterfaces();</code> but will this grant that all my traffic will go via VPN?</p>
