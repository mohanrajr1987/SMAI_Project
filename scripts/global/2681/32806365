<p>I'm streaming tons of bytes form one PC to web application (javascript) (running on other machine/pc/mobile) through websocket. Per my knowledge, there is a need to split the data into packages to maximize the network performance. My question is:</p>  <ol> <li>how I can obtain the payload size (optimal size) in real time to get the maximum speed!</li> <li>is this different if I want to use WebRTC?</li> </ol>
