<p>I have this two controller from two separate projects lets name them:</p>  <ul> <li>project1.controller1</li> <li>project2.controller1</li> </ul>  <p>Obviously these are two Spring controllers from different projects.What I want is to make project1.controller1 a gateway all request will be sent here. And will process the request if it will go to project2.controller1 or a new controller.</p>  <p>Some pseudoCode:</p>  <pre><code>@Controller public class someClassFromProject1{     @RequestMapping(value="/controller1", method=RequestMethod.POST)    public String smsCatcher(String target, HttpServletRequest request,         HttpServletResponse response){            //some processing, converting request to string, etc            if("someStringThatIsPartOfTheRequest".equals("someString"))             //carry request and forward it to project2.controller1            else             //go to another external controller          }      } </code></pre>  <p>And in project2.controller 1 will look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>@Controller public class someClassFromProject2{     @RequestMapping(value="/controller1", method=RequestMethod.POST)    public String smsCatcher(String target, HttpServletRequest request,         HttpServletResponse response){           //processing    }   } </code></pre>  <p>I've already tried <code>return "forward:/someUrl";</code> and <code>return "redirect:someUrl";</code>. It didn't work and it didn't reach project2.controller1. So any ideas on this one?</p>  <p>Edit: Forgot to add this one, different project means different WAR but deployed on the same sever. And the request should be carried over from project1.controller1 to project2.controller1 because I'm gonna process the request there.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
