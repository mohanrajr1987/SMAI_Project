<p>First let me provide some background:</p>  <p>Lately I've been playing around with Samaxes approach on <a href="http://samaxes.com/2014/04/jaxrs-beanvalidation-javaee7-wildfly/" rel="nofollow" title="Validating JAX-RS resource data with Bean Validation in Java EE 7 and WildFly">Validating JAX-RS resource data with Bean Validation in Java EE 7 and WildFly</a> where he implements an <code>ExceptionMapper</code> which handles <code>ValidationExceptions</code> in order to send convenient error reports to clients. You're forced to to do it that way as Resteasy won't throw <code>ConstraintViolationExceptions</code> directly for some obscure backward compatibility reasons.</p>  <p>Therefore in any <code>ValidationExceptionMapper</code> implementation one has to conduct some more or less intense inspection on the incoming <code>ValidationException</code> including checks on its type to make sure it's an instance of <code>ResteasyViolationException</code>.</p>  <p>And then there's a line I don't understand:</p>  <pre><code>// ... if (exception instanceof ResteasyViolationException) {             ResteasyViolationException resteasyViolationException = ResteasyViolationException.class.cast(exception);             Exception e = resteasyViolationException.getException();             if (e != null) {                 return buildResponse(unwrapException(e), MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN, Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);             } else if ( //... </code></pre>  <p>(full code on <a href="https://github.com/samaxes/jaxrs-beanvalidation-javaee7/blob/master/wildfly/src/main/java/com/samaxes/javax/rs/validation/ValidationExceptionMapper.java" rel="nofollow" title="githubquot;">Github</a>)</p>  <p>Now, under which circumstances would <code>e.getException</code> return something other than <code>null</code>? For what reason does this method exist? It is not required by the Bean Validation API, Resteasy javadoc does not explain a single thing at all and as you can see the code above isn't commented as well. So, what could someone possibly "attach" to a <code>ResteasyViolationException</code> and why should it directly be mapped to internal server error?</p>  <p>As always, thanks (a lot) in advance!</p>
