<p>I have a web project in which I have beans injected using spring java annotations. Now in the same web project, I want to create few beans using xml based configuration. (It will be hard for me to give here detail explanation, Why I want to do so). So to achieve this, I specified a <code>ContextLoaderListener</code> and <code>contextConfigLocation</code> in my <code>web.xml</code>. After doing this, When I deployed my project war on server, I found that only those beans created using xml (<code>applicationContext.xml</code>) were getting created, Spring was not able to create and inject the beans created using annotations based approach.</p>  <p>Is this type of use case possible to achieve i.e creating some beans using annotations and some using applicationContext.xml for the same project. If yes, I would  appreciate the help on the same. </p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
