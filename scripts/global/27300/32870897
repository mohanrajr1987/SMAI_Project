<p>I am planning on creating a small website with JavaEE where a user can vote but only every 5 minutes. There are two buttons. One to vote yes and the other to vote no. I want the buttons to only be clickable every 5 minutes. Whats the best way to do this?</p>  <p>I thought of getting the users IP and entering it into my DB along with the timestamp. Everytime a user would vote I would get their IP from the DB and check if 5 mins have passed since their last vote. What do you think of this solution? Is this best practise?</p>  <p>I am trying to avoid a login or any other sort of authentication. I plan on using JSF, Java, mySQL and AJAX.</p>
