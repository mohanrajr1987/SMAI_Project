<p>I'll be honest not sure if this is the best stack exchange question as it is board but here we go.</p>  <p>I'm in school for computer science and I just started a class using JavaEE. No one seems to be able to give me a straight answer. From what we have developed so far in our little labs it seems like we are creating web pages that have very nice user-interfaces? </p>  <p>My text book "Core JavaServer Faces" By David Geary &amp; Cay Horstmann states in the intro you can think of it as a "Swing for server-side applications". I have seen how this can relate because our web pages have been able to store input like with php. For example if my user inputs a name and password I'm able to remember them. </p>
