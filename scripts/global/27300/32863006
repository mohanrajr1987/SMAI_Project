<p>I had a look around for a Java solution to logging REST or HTTP calls in general in a Java EE environment to a database for later analysis but I haven't been successful so far.</p>  <p>My requirements are logging the request and response of course, including some meta data like the ip of the requesting side (client/server), the currently authenticated user and the status code. This should happen in way that you could search for this meta data in a efficient way so that there is not much stress on the database and you could build a log browser on top of it which can present you with results without being unresponsive even if there were several million log entries.</p>  <p>A nice to have would be that the log viewer is already there and does not have to be built.</p>  <p>Do I have to implement this myself or is there any solution that I could throw in?</p>
