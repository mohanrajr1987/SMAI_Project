<p>I want to implement JAX-WS API in an existing Web application which runs only in Tomcat and uses servlet. I dont have any knowledge on JAX-WS. As I worried about web application portability from tomcat to other servers, I am preferring to implement JAX-WS as standard alone application in tomcat. What's the better way of doing it, implementing JAX-WS on Java EE container or like standalone application in Tomcat. Is there any better way of doing it...? And also I would like to know pros and cons implementing JAX-WS in container VS standalone application. And also suggest me Best JAX-WS implementation framework.</p>
