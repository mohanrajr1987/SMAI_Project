<p>I'm very new to J2EE, so apologies if this is obvious.  I have to work around a bad database design, which has an update which cannot be done safely in parallel.  The easiest way to fix this (for now) is to place a mutex protection around the method call to serialize it's access.</p>  <p>I understand that you can't safely just use the synchronised keyword on the method in J2EE as the container may interfere.  Is there a "supported" way in J2EE to make a mutex/semaphore/lock in an EJB to ensure access to a method is serialised  for the entire J2EE application?</p>
