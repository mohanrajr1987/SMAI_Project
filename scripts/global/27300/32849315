<p>Using Apache TomEE, I'm trying to have the embedded broker advertise itself over multicast. However, I can't figure out how to do that...</p>  <p>Here's what I have and it doesn't work. The outbound connection occurs, but the inbound does not. I'm tried a similar setup using xbean, and the connection DOES occur, so I know the external broker is configured correctly. </p>  <p>Any help appreciated!</p>  <p><code> &lt;Resource                  id="ra/activemq"                  type="ActiveMQResourceAdapter"&gt;                 BrokerXmlConfig = broker:(nio://0.0.0.0:61617?discoveryUri:multicast://224.6.1.6:61616,network:static:(tcp:/external-broker:61616)?useInactivityMonitor=false)/tomee0?persistent=false                  ServerUrl = vm://tomee0                  datasource =          &lt;/Resource&gt; </code></p>
