<p>I had build a e commerce client side android app, but I do not have an idea, how to build a server side for my app in java. I found one tutorial on netbeans <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/ecommerce/intro.html" rel="nofollow">https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/ecommerce/intro.html</a> but I am bit confused about which framework such as EJB,JPA,Spring,Hibernate,iBatis to use and in which scenanario, because I don't have idea about these frameworks. </p>
