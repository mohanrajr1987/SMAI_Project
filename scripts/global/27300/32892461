<p>I'm creating a Java EE erp poject. It originally had one EJB module and worked fine for importing classes and entities alike. After having some issues with persistence units I decided to create another ejb module but I am unable to import any classes contained in that EJB module.  I imported classes from the original ejb module like this: import erp.production.entities.EntityName;  When i attemp to do the same from the newly created ejb module it is unable to find the class.</p>
