<p>I´m thinking in buying a laptop with a Intel Celeron n2840 inside. Probablly with 4 or 8gb of ram and a ssd. I´m very worry about that cheap processor. Someone can give me some advice or experience of JavaEE programming with this kind of cheap processors. I´m using NetBeans and Wildfly as my application server. Sorry for my bad english, hope you can understandme. I´m a student so I´m handling a very short budget. Waiting for your advices!</p>
