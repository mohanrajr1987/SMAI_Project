<p>In my test application (JSF, PrimeFaces, Wildfly 8) I have a simple messaging interface for writing a message and viewing those that were sent to me. I now would like to create an automatic respond for those messages that were not answered after 5 minutes. This automatic respond is meant to be independent of any person sitting behind the browser window and clicking the refresh button.</p>  <p>My current idea is to create a new class annotated with @ApplicationScoped. This class shall run an individual thread handling the responding process. Would that be a good approach? Or is there a functionality somewhere that already covers this matter?</p>
