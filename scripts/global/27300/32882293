<p>I dont know if its me who finds criteria queries with JPA difficult. What to do next in order to get Tag(s) with name = :tagNam</p>  <pre><code>    Tag getTagByName(String tagName){          CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();         CriteriaQuery&lt;Tag&gt; cq = cb.createQuery(Tag.class);         Root&lt;Tag&gt; root = cq.from(Tag.class);         **//what to do next in order to get Tag(s) with name = :tagNam**     } </code></pre>  <p><code>Tag</code> is an entity with field <code>name</code></p>  <p>I have viewed:</p>  <ol> <li><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjivm.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjivm.html</a>   </li> <li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-typesafejpa/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-typesafejpa/</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery" rel="nofollow">http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery</a></li> </ol>  <p>But was unable to grasp concepts. Is there an easy step by step or comprehensive tutorial too? </p>  <p>I am also frustrated as I was required (according to tutorials) to do use <code>Tag_</code> which does not resolves of course.</p>
