<p>I am planning on using the Mybatis as the ORM tool for my application, before I dive deep into the configuration, i'd like to know if there is a way I can do JMS + Mybatis into the same transaction(Like XA transaction or two phase commit)? If not, does spring JDBC support the above case?</p>  <p>I've looked up a few answers in the SO, but have not got a concrete answer to Mybatis related.</p>  <p>Referred: </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229573/spring-transaction-synchonization-of-jdbc-and-jms">Spring Transaction Synchonization of JDBC and JMS</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24957045/ibm-mqmanager-as-xa-transaction-manager-with-spring-jms-and-spring-tx">IBM MQManager as XA Transaction Manager with Spring-jms and Spring-tx</a></p>
