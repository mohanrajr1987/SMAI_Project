<p>I am trying to get a result set by combining "bolg_post" and "User" doc. </p>  <pre><code>blog_post # embeds many comments doc {    "_id" : ObjectId( "55ea003e4102135d9d000677" ),   "text" : "This is a post about natural beauties of hawaii.. blah blah..",   "author_id": "345345026743545647567567", # references to User doc id   "updated_at" : Date( 1441398846696 ),   "created_at" : Date( 1441398846696 ),   "comments" : [      { "_id" : ObjectId( "55ea003e4102135d9d000002" ),       "text" : "Very good article",       "user_id": "83753iy45735y84934759",       "updated_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ),       "created_at" : Date( 1441400501867 )     },      { "_id" : ObjectId( "345a003e41026743545645454" ),       "text" : "Hawaii is my fav",       "user_id" : "55e7668c4102132ea8000066", # references to User doc id       "updated_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ),       "created_at" : Date( 1441400501867 )     }    ]  }  User # has many blog_posts  {    "_id" : ObjectId( "83753iy45735y84934759" ),   "name" : "John abc",   "status": "active", # could be inactive, pending, deleted etc.   "age": 29,   "updated_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ),   "created_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ) }  {    "_id" : ObjectId( "55e7668c4102132ea8000066" ),   "name" : "Lisa xyz",   "status": "inactive", # could be inactive, pending, deleted etc.   "age": 24,   "updated_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ),   "created_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ) }  {    "_id" : ObjectId( "345345026743545647567567" ),   "name" : "David uyi",   "status": "active", # could be inactive, pending, deleted etc.   "age": 39,   "updated_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ),   "created_at" : Date( 1441400501867 ) } </code></pre>  <p>I want to get only those blog posts, where its author status is active in User doc. Same way, I want to get only those comments for a post, those are posted by user whose status is active in user doc</p>  <pre><code>{    "blog_id" : "55ea003e4102135d9d000677",   "text" : "This is a post about natural beauties of hawaii.. blah blah..",   "author": {     "author_id": "345345026743545647567567",     "name" : "David uyi",     "age": 39   }   "updated_at" : Date( 1441398846696 ),   "created_at" : Date( 1441398846696 ),   "comments" : [      { "comment_id" : ObjectId( "55ea003e4102135d9d000002" ),       "text" : "Very good article",       "user" : {         "user_id":          "name" : "John abc",         "age": 29       }     }     # here Lisa's comment is not shown as she is inactive   ]  } </code></pre>  <p>But the catch is I want in pagination, that means, suppose I want only 5 records (limit 0, 5) in per query result. So the easiest way would be grabbing first 5 blog_post documents. and then take user_id from them and then go to User doc and then find if those user are active or not. if not, then remove those entries. But this way, I may end up having less than  5 result set. So how can I do this in one go. Assume that I have 100,00,00 users and 100,000 posts. So it would be bad design   if I do the way I talked about earlier, not in one go</p>
