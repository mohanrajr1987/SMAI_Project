<p>I have a report object that renders fine, however I have a reportapproval object that I want to pass to the report view so I can run a calculation within the report view. Each user has_one report and each report has multiple reportapprovals. How can I call a specific reportapproval and send that instance to the report controller or view. Here is my report controller.</p>  <pre><code>class Users::ReportsController &lt; ApplicationController   def show       @report = Report.find(params[:id])       authorize @report   end end </code></pre>  <p>I tried to pass</p>  <pre><code>@reportapproval = Reportapprovals.where(user_id: @report.user_id).first </code></pre>  <p>in the show method but the ReportController wont recognize the Reportapproval. </p>  <p>How can I pass the instance to the view?</p>
