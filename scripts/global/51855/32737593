<p>Having uniqueness validation on User model:</p>  <pre><code>validates_uniqueness_of :email, :message =&gt; "Email Address Already In Use. Have You Forgot Your Password?" </code></pre>  <p>It fails to raise an error when creating a new user and being saved:</p>  <pre><code> user = {          :email      =&gt; email,          :other_attributes =&gt; other,          }      user = User.new(user)      count_new_real_session(user)     set_timezone(user)      if user.save         #code that is being executed (it shouldn't!)     end </code></pre>  <p>Although there is another user with same email, the user is saved. Any idea why the validation is not stopping the user to be saved?</p>  <p>More info (copy and pasted right from the database):</p>  <ul> <li>user1: "email" : "borjacarranza85@gmail.com"</li> <li>user2: "email" : "borjacarranza85@gmail.com"</li> </ul>
