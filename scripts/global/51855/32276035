<p>I have a collection of methods in a model. Currently all the methods run on an after_create callback. Like so...</p>  <pre><code>class DataAggregation   include Mongoid::Document    after_create :report_extras, :primary_income, :income_by_name, etc... end </code></pre>  <p>I want to make all the methods run when I run a particular method in the model something like this...</p>  <pre><code>def update_report       :report_extras, :primary_income, :income_by_name, etc...     end </code></pre>  <p>How can I do this or is this wrong and I should set something up as a unique call in the controller.</p>
