<p>I have schema where:</p>  <ul> <li>Object embeds_many PropertyValue</li> <li>PropertyValue embedded_in Object</li> <li>PropertyValue belongs_to Property</li> </ul>  <p>something like an "embedded reference".</p>  <p>The Property model allows to define new properties and associated meta-data.</p>  <p>My users need to be able to specify a set of properties for a given object and provide a value for each property.</p>  <p>I can't use a simple embed, because to assign a property, my users would have to fill-in by hand all the meta-data for the property, which leads to possible typos and frustration.</p>  <p>To not lose performance, upon save, PropertyValue makes a copy of the meta-data of the property it belongs to.</p>  <p><strong>Is such approach appropriate or am I leading myself to a hell of broken relations?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Am I forcing relational reasoning onto a document-based database?</strong></p>  <p>I'm asking because at the moment everything works from my RailsAdmin backend, but in some of my specs <strong>property_value.property is nil</strong> and I'm sure that my factories are setup correctly.</p>
