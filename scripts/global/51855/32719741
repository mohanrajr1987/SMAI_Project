<p>I'm using rails 4.2.4</p>  <p>I'm trying to follow this tuto : <a href="http://robert-reiz.com/2012/03/05/rails-mongodb-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://robert-reiz.com/2012/03/05/rails-mongodb-tutorial/</a></p>  <p>in order to start using MongoDB with a rails application, but i'm having versions issues, here he's using some old versions,so when I 'bundle install' it says that it depends on an older version of activemodel (3.1)</p>  <p>I tried to use some other versions, fixing the conflicts one by one, but i ended up using mongo 2.1 (who depends on bson 3.0) and bson_ext 1.6.0 (who depends on bson 1.6.0)</p>  <p>How am I suppose to deal with this conflict? Is there a way to tell each gem to use a different version of bson? Am I doing this all wrong?</p>  <p>Thank you !</p>
