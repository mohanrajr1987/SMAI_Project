<p>I have a question - is there a way to rearrange the order of fields in an existing mongodb document?</p>  <p>My case is that I have a document that aggregates some numeric values. On insertion it would be:</p>  <pre><code>{   "alexander": {"quantity":27},   "beatrix": {"quantity": 28},   "appolo": {"quantity": 5} } </code></pre>  <p>Now there is a process that is receiving new quantities for those users and aggregates them by addition. So after some time we will have values like:</p>  <pre><code>{   "alexander": {"quantity":30},   "beatrix": {"quantity": 40},   "appolo": {"quantity": 31} } </code></pre>  <p>It would be cool If I could return the users ordered by the quantity value, so something like:</p>  <pre><code>{   "beatrix": {"quantity": 40},   "appolo": {"quantity": 31},   "alexander": {"quantity":30} } </code></pre>  <p>I read that mongodb is preserving insertion order. I didn't find any way to dynamically specify the order of fields in the document. Could you give me a hint if this is doable?</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>I'm looking for things that I can achieve in mongodb console that would be client technology agnostic.</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
