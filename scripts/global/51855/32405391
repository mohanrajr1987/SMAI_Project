<p>I'm using Mongoid to access a MongoDB database, however I'm running into an odd problem.  It seems like I can only query for records using <code>find_by</code>, as <code>find</code> will always return nil:</p>  <pre><code>invoices = Invoice.find({}) p "invoices" p invoices puts ''  invoice = Invoice.find_by({ _id: &lt;ObjectId&gt; }) p "invoice" p invoice puts '' </code></pre>  <p>The second query using <code>find_by</code> will return a single record.  According to <a href="http://mongoid.github.io/en/mongoid/docs/querying.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>, <code>find</code> should be returning every record that satisfies the query.</p>  <p>Does anyone have an idea what could be causing this?</p>
