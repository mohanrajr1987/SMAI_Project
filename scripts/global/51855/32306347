<p>I'm trying to update an attribute on my Model and have created a method within the <code>User</code> model like so:</p>  <pre><code>def add_history(object)     self[:sign_in_history] += [object]     self.save end </code></pre>  <p>Then in my <code>SessionController</code> I've added the following:</p>  <pre><code>user.add_history({ ip: request.remote_ip, os: request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], date: DateTime.now }) user.save </code></pre>  <p>but that doesn't work. the attribute is not being updated. I've also tried (in the controller):</p>  <pre><code>user[:sign_in_history] += [{ ip: request.remote_ip, os: request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], date: DateTime.now }] user.save </code></pre>  <p>But that didn't work either. What am I missing here?</p>
