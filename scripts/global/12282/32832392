<p>I want to store two numbers from a string into two distinct variables - for example, var1 = 3 and var2 = 0 from "[3:0]". I have the following code snippet:</p>  <pre><code>String myStr = "[3:0]"; if (myStr.trim().matches("\\[(\\d+)\\]")) {     // Do something.     // If it enter the here, here I want to store 3 and 0 in different variables or an array }  </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible doing this with split and regular expressions?</p>
