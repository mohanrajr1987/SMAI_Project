<p>Suppose I have two files A and B. Contents of A :</p>  <pre><code>foo1 foo2 bar1 bar3 </code></pre>  <p>Content of B : </p>  <pre><code>bar2 bar3 foo3 foo4 </code></pre>  <p>How do I select the second line from A, and the first line from B? There is no search string. I need to select the lines containing all possible common strings.</p>  <p>Please note that I am NOT looking for matching lines from two different files. The desired lines are not identical, but contain the query string.</p>  <p>Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
