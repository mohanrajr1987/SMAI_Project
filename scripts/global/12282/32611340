<p>I have the below pattern in a PHP script that works grand:</p>  <pre><code>define("PATTERN", "|^['0-9a-zA-Z\\\/\[\]\(\)\=\&gt;\,\'\~\-\^\@\$\%\*\&amp;\?\:\;\_\.\€\+\|\^\@\%\s" . '"' . "]{0,50}$|"); </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to allow accented characters in other languages by using the <code>\p{L}</code> option but any strings still fail the pattern.</p>  <pre><code>define("PATTERN", "|^['0-9\p{L}\\\/\[\]\(\)\=\&gt;\,\'\~\-\^\@\$\%\*\&amp;\?\:\;\_\.\€\+\|\^\@\%\s" . '"' . "]{0,50}$|"); </code></pre>  <p>Any online regex tester I use says something along the lines of:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>No match groups were extracted.</p>      <p>This means that your pattern matches but there were no (capturing (groups)) in it that matched anything in the subject string.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Online example: <a href="https://regex101.com/r/nV4yC5/1" rel="nofollow">https://regex101.com/r/nV4yC5/1</a></p>  <p>Is there a way to allow foreign language characters using UTF-8?</p>
