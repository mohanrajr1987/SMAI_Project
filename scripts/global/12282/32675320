<p>I have two images: a large image of a puppy (the scene) and a small crop of its nose (the target):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u5U9a.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u5U9a.jpg" alt="puppy"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W7Qbs.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W7Qbs.jpg" alt="nose"></a></p>  <p>I have gathered SURF points for both the target and the scene and then matched them. I have displayed the best matches on the scene image as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8gAqQ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8gAqQ.jpg" alt="matching SURF points"></a> </p>  <p>What is the best way to identify the <strong>largest cluster</strong> of matched surf points? </p>  <p>In this example, all the points are well clustered. However, in some other examples, there are several outliers which I want to exclude. </p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> KDE worked well for me. Thanks everyone, that's great.</p>
