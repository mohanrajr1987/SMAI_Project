<p>I'm trying to find the transpose of a matrix, I know my code so far is not correct but what I'm more concerned about is why when I test it with transpose <code>[[4;3];[1;5];[6;7]]</code> it's going to the first match case which is an empty list?</p>  <pre><code>let rec transpose = function      | [] -&gt; failwith "Error, no matrix supplied"      | [[]] -&gt; []      | [[x]] -&gt; [[x]]      | x::xs -&gt; let temp = List.head x :: (List.map (fun n -&gt; List.headn) xs)                     temp :: transpose(xs);; </code></pre>
