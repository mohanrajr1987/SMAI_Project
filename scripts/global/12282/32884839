<p>How could I request from users to enter a certain digit with certain times to be inserted in an input element?</p>  <p>I need to request from Them to input one time a certain digit, let we say number 0, in the text or password field, along with any other numbers from 1-4 only.</p>  <p>How could I do that using HTML5 or any other way? What is the pattern?</p>  <p>If I had this code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="password" name="password" maxlength="4" pattern="\d+" title="3 numbers only, with 1 zero only" placeholder="3 numbers only, with 1 zero only"  value="&lt;?php echo htmlentities($password); ?&gt;" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Then, my required patterns to be as example: ("x" is any digit)</p>  <pre><code>xxx0 x0xx 0xxx xx0x </code></pre>  <p>and the rest of possible combinations.</p>  <p>NOTE agin: -It doesn't matter the format, the matter is 1 time of number 0 to be inserted every time. -Only numbers from 1 to 4</p>
