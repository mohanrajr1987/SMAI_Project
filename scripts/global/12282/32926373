<p>I have a table <code>artist</code> with several columns like <code>name</code>, <code>type</code> ...<br> I want the column <code>name</code> to be returned and ordered alphabetically, but the column name should be adjusted. If the name of the artist starts with <em>'the '</em> (case insensitive) then it should be removed and placed behind the name in uppercase, for example <em>'the Beatles'</em> -> <em>'Beatles, THE'</em>. </p>  <p>This is the code I have (it doesn't work):</p>  <pre><code>SELECT name,   CASE     WHEN UPPER(name) LIKE 'THE %' THEN CONCAT(RIGHT(name, length(name)-4),', THE')   END AS name  FROM artist ORDER BY name </code></pre>  <p>Problem 1: <code>name</code> is not replaced, it creates a new column.</p>  <p>Problem 2: new column has same name => column <code>name</code> is ambiguous in <code>order by name</code>.</p>  <p>How can I easily solve those problems?</p>
