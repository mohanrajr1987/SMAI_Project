<p>I am working in a CSS environment that is missing CSS3 (and much of CSS2) so I can't do flow columns. I have to simulate it with <code>float</code>'s and correct ordering. I want the order of the items to be the same as they would be in a <code>column-count: 3;</code> layout. Like this:</p>  <pre><code>//We have 6 items, lay them out like this: 1   3   5 2   4   6  //We have 5 items, lay them out like this: 1   3   5 2   4     //We have 4 items, lay them out like this: 1   3   4 2     //We have 3 items, lay them out like this: 1   2   3  //We have 7 items, lay them out like this: 1   4   6 2   5   7 3 </code></pre>  <p>So it flows, while also attempting to balance but giving the first column the extra one if it's not divisible by number of columns.</p>  <p>I am fine with ideas in any programming language (I can adapt it for the PHP and JavaScript I'm using). </p>
