<p>So I've got a bunch of case classes that take on this format:</p>  <pre><code>case class A(value: String) case class B(value: String) case class C(value: String) </code></pre>  <p>I'm taking in several Option[String] values as parameters in a function and I want to create Option[A], Option[B] if the values from the parameters isn't None.</p>  <p>I'm currently doing it like this:</p>  <pre><code>val first = parameterOptional match {     case Some(theStringValue) =&gt; Some(A))     case None =&gt; None } </code></pre>  <p>And it works but I wanted to know if there's a more consise way of doing this, I'm very new to Scala.</p>  <p>Variable names in the examples have obviously been altered.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
