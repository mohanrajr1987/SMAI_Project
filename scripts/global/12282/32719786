<p>I have very big data and the next step is to delete certain strings (i.e. the associated rows) based on patterns. I need to use Regex for that. For example image column A as:</p>  <pre><code>A-929.XZT-93002-B-DKE A-938-XZT-29849-B-DKE A-938-AXZ-93923-B-DKE ... ... </code></pre>  <p>There are many more columns besides A. Now I want to delete all rows completely which contain the phrade "XZT" with any element before except a character. In this case it would be row1 and row2.</p>  <p>My question is as follows:</p>  <p>Can this be done in R as effectively as for example in VBA? Which package would you recommend to do so, or can it be done just as effectively with the base functions?</p>  <p>I am asking because there are different ways to apply Regex in R and I have to do it for about ~ 20,000++ rows numerous times, so I want to do it as fast as possible.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
