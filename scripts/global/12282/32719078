<p>I have a file containing regular expressions, e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>City of (.*) (.*) State </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to read these (line by line), match them against a string, and print out the extraction (matched group). For example: The string <code>City of Berlin</code> should match with the first expression <code>City of (.*)</code> from the file, after that <code>Berlin</code> should be extracted.</p>  <p>This is what I've got so far:</p>  <pre><code>use warnings; use strict;  my @pattern;  open(FILE, "&lt;pattern.txt");   # open the file described above while (my $line = &lt;FILE&gt;) {     push @pattern, $line;     # store it inside the @pattern variable } close(FILE);  my $exampleString = "City of Berlin"; # line that should be matched and                                       # Berlin should be extracted  foreach my $p (@pattern) { # try each pattern     if (my ($match) = $exampleString =~ /$p/) {         print "$match";     } } </code></pre>  <p>I want <code>Berlin</code> to be printed.</p>  <ul> <li>What happens with the regex inside the <code>foreach</code> loop?</li> <li>Is it not compiled? Why?</li> <li>Is there even a better way to do this?</li> </ul>
