<p>TokensRegex (a module from Standford CoreNLP library) supports &amp; (AND) operators. As I understand, you can use pattern 'X &amp; Y' to match any sequences containing both X and Y. But when I used the operator in real code, it didn't work as the way I expected. Here is my Java code:</p>  <pre><code>String content = "data is here and everywhere"; String pattern = "data &amp; is";  TokenizerFactory tf = PTBTokenizer.factory(new CoreLabelTokenFactory(), ""); List&lt;CoreLabel&gt; tokens = tf.getTokenizer(new StringReader(content)).tokenize(); TokenSequencePattern seqPattern = TokenSequencePattern.compile(pattern); TokenSequenceMatcher matcher = seqPattern.getMatcher(tokens);  if(matcher.find()){       System.out.println("Matched"); // &lt;- I expected to have this printed out } else {       System.out.println("Unmatched"); // &lt;- But I've got this instead :( } </code></pre>  <p>Would you please tell me what's wrong with my code or my understanding? Thank you in advance.</p>
