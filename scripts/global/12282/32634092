<p>I am reading files from a folder using List.files but i want to read only specific files to be read. I have files like below. </p>  <pre><code>D420000900100hour.1-4-2001.31-12-2001 D420000700600hour8.1-1-2001.31-12-2004 D420000500150hour.1-1-2001.31-12-2004 </code></pre>  <p>Notice here i have "hour" and "hour8". I want to only list files containing exactly "hour". </p>  <pre><code> files &lt;- list.files(pattern = "hour") </code></pre>  <p>With this piece of code however it returns files with both "hour" and "hour8". I am trying to use ^ and $. but they dont seem to work with "pattern". </p>  <p>How do i do this. </p>
