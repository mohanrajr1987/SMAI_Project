<p>I have got a data set:</p>  <pre><code>16    18 1 24 7 13 13 24 17 15 10 16 2 16 11 21 15 24 6 13 2 2 21 16 8 16 11 0 19 </code></pre>  <p><em>Background:</em> These values represent the number of hours a device is operating per given day. I have about a months worth of data presented above, and the company has requested of me to 'analyse' this data, ie see if any patterns are emerging. Ideally I would like to use bash to write a code that can do this for me - but I don't know how to do it.</p>  <p><em>Research:</em> I have looked at various question in analysing data. Using a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1418403/best-way-to-analyse-data-using-ruby">counter</a> could work, other suggestions include <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22423045/how-to-analyse-and-predictmachine-learning-a-time-series-data-set-using-scikit">machine learning</a>, but this may be too difficult in bash.</p>  <p><em>My Approach:</em> I'm thinking of having two parameters (<em>a</em>) easy working (&lt;=12hrs) &amp; (<em>b</em>) hard working (>12hrs). So the code then compare the pattern of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, so then the data would be for example, <em>aaaabbababaababba</em>, so from this the software should be able to recognize if a pattern is emerging - or there is a pattern present.</p>  <p><strong>Questions:</strong> <strong>(Q1)</strong> How can I make software 'realize' a pattern is emerging? <strong>(Q2)</strong> Can such software be written in bash? <strong>(Q3)</strong> Is there a better approach to mine? <strong>(Q4)</strong> What would be a better language to write such a code in?</p>
