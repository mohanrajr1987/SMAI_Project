<p>I have a string of 5 numbers, and I need to separate them and store them in an array. I've been trying to come up with a function to do this for hours, unsuccessfully, so I'm wondering if anyone have any ideas of accomplishing this, or if there is a build-in method to do this?  </p>  <pre><code>$string = "1 2 3 4 5" </code></pre>  <p><b> Required Outcomes </b></p>  <pre><code>$array[0] = "1 2 3 4 5" (5)  $array[1] = "1 2 3 4" (4)  $array[2] = "2 3 4 5" (4)  $array[3] = "1 2 3" (3) $array[4] = "2 3 4" (3) $array[5] = "3 4 5" (3)  $array[6] = "1 2" (2) $array[7] = "2 3" (2)  $array[8] = "3 4" (2) $array[9] = "4 5" (2)  $array[10] = "1" (1) $array[11] = "2" (1) $array[12] = "3" (1) $array[13] = "4" (1) $array[14] = "5" (1) </code></pre>  <p>P.S: The example string's numbers are 5 of them, but that's just an example. The working function should work with any amount of numbers. Thank you.</p>  <p>Edit: I do not need a function to explode this. I already know the explode function. I'm asking for a function to get me the results below Required Outcomes no matter the amount of numbers. So if numbers are "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10", the outcome would be like the patterns below require outcomes.</p>  <p>The focus should be on the patterns below required outcomes. Those patterns are the patterns that I want to get. I need a function get get those exact patterns.</p>  <p><b> More Examples </b></p>  <pre><code>$string = "1 2 3 4"  $array[0] = "1 2 3 4"  $array[1] = "1 2 3" $array[2] = "2 3 4"  $array[3] = "1 2" $array[4] = "2 3" $array[5] = "3 4"  $array[6] = "1" $array[7] = "2" $array[8] = "3" $array[9] = "4" </code></pre>
