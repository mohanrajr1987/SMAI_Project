<p>Let the memory patterns be 1, 1, 1, 1 and 1, -1, -1, 1. In that case, the synaptic memory matrix i.e. the sum of outer products of the patterns for a Hopfield network is:</p>  <pre><code>0, 0, 0, -2 0, 0, -2, 0 0, -2, 0, 0 -2, 0, 0, 0 </code></pre>  <p>The lowest eigenvalues (determined using the SymPy module) of the above matrix are -2 and -2 i.e. a degeneracy of 2. The corresponding eigenvectors are {0, 1, 1, 0} and {1, 0, 0, 1}. </p>  <p>My questions:</p>  <ol> <li>What is the significance of the ground state eigenvectors?</li> <li>How do I know that my training patterns are memorized correctly?</li> </ol>
