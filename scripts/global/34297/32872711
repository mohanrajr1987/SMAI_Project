<p>Is there a common class and an implementation of the <a href="https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/ss/extractor/ExcelExtractor.html" rel="nofollow">ExcelExtractor</a> interface that handles, uniformly, extraction of text from xls and xlsx sources? Maybe, something in <code>ss</code> package.</p>  <p>I am looking for something that would allow me to do something like, but by getting the right implementation from the factory, based on the file type.</p>  <p>Right now, I am having to explicitly use the <code>org.apache.poi.hssf.extractor.ExcelExtractor</code> for the xls files and <code>org.apache.poi.xssf.extractor.XSSFExcelExtractor</code> for xlsx.</p>  <p>For example, explicit approach for xls:</p>  <pre><code>InputStream inp = new FileInputStream(path); HSSFWorkbook wb = new HSSFWorkbook(new POIFSFileSystem(inp)); ExcelExtractor extractor = new ExcelExtractor(wb);  extractor.setFormulasNotResults(true); extractor.setIncludeSheetNames(false); String text = extractor.getText(); </code></pre>  <p>I can implement my own Factory, but before I do that I thought to ask to see if there is a common approach that handles both formats (that is what <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/hssf/eventusermodel/examples/XLS2CSVmra.java" rel="nofollow">ss</a> package is for).</p>
