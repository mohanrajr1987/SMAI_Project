<p>Helo,</p>  <p>i have a question about docx and active x.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;w:object w:dxaOrig="225" w:dyaOrig="225"&gt;                 &lt;v:shape type="#_x0000_t75" style="width:171.6pt;height:22.2pt" id="_x0000_i1105" o:ole=""&gt;                     &lt;v:imagedata o:title="" r:id="rId12"/&gt;                 &lt;/v:shape&gt;                 &lt;w:control w:name="boxExtern" w:shapeid="_x0000_i1105" r:id="rId13"/&gt;             &lt;/w:object&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So my problem is i want to know if the w.Control element is checked. This element is an checkbox in the Word. I found the Object in Java but i found no way to read out the real value checked or not. Anyone knows an issue. If it written into the BinaryPart of the shape image, anyone has an description for this stream what part of the bytes are used. I found out that the BinaryPart is changing but there is no logical in it. </p>  <p>Thanks for Help Mirko</p>
