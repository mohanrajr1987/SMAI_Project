<p>We currently allow our users to connect to their google drive and download sheets files via the api excel export. </p>  <p>Recently though it seems like something has changed with pivot tables and sheets with those included are no longer compatible with our excel library (we are using apache POI v3.12)</p>  <p>Has anyone else experienced this/is this a known change?</p>  <hr>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>Seems like the issue is actually the excel export functionality in google sheets, it exports pivot tables as blank cells. this seems like a bug?</p>  <hr>  <p>Update2:</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EJBqPgPgN0xO1hpz8n_xM1-WZhPCfKU4RffCyeV6N74/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Example file displaying the problem</a></p>  <p>It looks like when a file is re-uploaded to drive it will display the table correctly again. but when downloaded in excel or open office it is not view able in those applications.</p>
