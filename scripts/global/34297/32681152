<p>I have the following Excel to insert records into DB using Apache POI and MySQL:</p>  <p><code>Column A Column B  Column C  Column D Column E                     V1       V2       V3                     100      200      300                     Axx      Bxx      Cxx 1   Description1    1        3        10 2   Description2    2        3        12 3   Description3    3        2        23 4   Description4    1       11        31 5   Description5    23      22        1 </code> I wanted this data to be imported to DB in three separate tables:</p>  <p>First table: The values of column C1, C2, C3 are inserted as rows in one table and subsequent columns (of D, E) just considering first three rows. I was able to do this with no issues and storing the column index as id field in that table. Table 1 :</p>  <p><code>3 V1 100 Axx  4 V2 100 Bxx  5 V3 300 Cxx </code></p>  <p>Second table: I was also able to insert the values of rows of Columns A and B and rownum in this table as  table 2:</p>  <p><code>4 1  Description1  5 2  Description2  6 3  Description3   ...  ... </code> Third table: this is where I hit rock bottom, was not able to keep a map of cell (column C, row 4) and its value. Expected result was to have a map table with value, something like this: Table 3 Expected: </p>  <p><code>4 3 1   4 4 3  4 5 10 </code> Have tried options of Map of ArrayLists, LinkedHashMap with Arraylist, but failed, in the same reading iteration, I'm not able to create a ArrayList of Arraylist, which is the desired output of table 3.</p>  <p>Please advise what is suitable approach using HashMap, ArrayList, or LinkedHashMap</p>
