<p>We are using Apache POI to create a very simple spreadsheet. Everything works in the development environment. When released, the project is exported as a runnable JAR; this jar and all required libraries are placed on a central server. The various PCs all reference these same files.</p>  <p>On most PCs (Linux and Win7), everything works. On a minority of Win7 machines, however, we receive the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>DOMSource cannot be processed: check that saxon9-dom.jar is on the   classpath.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15438011/domsource-cannot-be-processed-check-that-saxon9-dom-jar-is-on-the-classpath">adding the -D option as suggested here</a>, to no avail. In any case, it's unclear why the dependencies should break only on certain machines. Could there be a difference in the order that the libraries are loaded?</p>  <p>I have also tried extracting all dependencies into the exported the jar file. This (very fat!) jar file work - or doesn't work - on exactly the same machines.</p>  <p>I am at a loss: what could cause Apache POI to fail in this way on certain machines?</p>
