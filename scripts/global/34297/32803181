<p>I know this Question has been asked before but I can't do it! It's my first try ever to import something.</p>  <p>I followed these instructions <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_poi/apache_poi_environment.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_poi/apache_poi_environment.htm</a></p>  <p>but I just get  "XSSFWorkBook cannot be resolved to a type"</p>  <p>Also Code Completion don't know any org.apache Classes.</p>  <p>Is it because the dom4j-1.6.1.jar file is missing?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
