<p>Let's say I read an .xslx file that has a table. And in that table there are let's say <code>money</code>, <code>accounts</code> and <code>cars</code> as coordinates Y and <code>week1</code>, <code>week2</code> and <code>week3</code> as coordinates X. Let's say I use passing arguments from the command line using coordinates like java myprogram <code>cars</code> <code>week2</code> so I want to add 1 to that cell.  </p>  <p>What is the best approach to solve this?<br> Do I have to read the table?<br> Can I find the row using something similar to?:</p>  <pre><code>if  sheet.contains("accounts" and "week2") add number </code></pre>
