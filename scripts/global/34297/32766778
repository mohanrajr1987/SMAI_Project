<p>I am still relatively new to the new SS API for Apache POI unified XLS/XLSX querying.</p>  <p>Could someone please advise for how to:  </p>  <p>a) do a retrieval of all the column names up to those where there is a data in the columns. For example, there is data only in columns up through D (it is ok if some inner columns are empty, e.g. "C").</p>  <p>b) do a column-oriented retrieval of the data. For example, I want to all values in the column named "Salary" or "D".</p>
