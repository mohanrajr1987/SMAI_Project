<p>I'm trying to get the URL from a Hyperlink in an Excel cell. I am finding that it is usually truncated, and not the complete URL.  When I open the spreadsheet in LibreOffice, I can see the full URL.</p>  <pre><code>Cell c = r.getCell(n); Hyperlink link = c.getHyperlink(); String address = link.getAddress(); System.out.println(address); // truncated! </code></pre>  <p>For example, in the spreadsheet, I see "<a href="http://www.co.brown.wi.us/i/f/NewsletterWinter" rel="nofollow">http://www.co.brown.wi.us/i/f/NewsletterWinter</a> 2012(1).pdf";  When I use the code above, it prints out "<a href="http://www.co.brown.wi.us/i/f/NewsletterWinter%20" rel="nofollow">http://www.co.brown.wi.us/i/f/NewsletterWinter%20</a>".</p>  <p>This is happening in pretty much every hyperlink in the spreadsheet.</p>  <p>How do you get the non-truncated URL?</p>
