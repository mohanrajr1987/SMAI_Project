<p>I am trying to read a .csv file created from the script which has the results of query run on DB. Now this file is created every time I run the query. While trying to get <code>XSSFWorkbook</code> object for it the following exception occurs:</p>  <blockquote> <pre><code>org.apache.poi.POIXMLException: org.apache.poi.openxml4j.exceptions.InvalidFormatException:  Package should contain a content type part [M1.13] </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>Now I have another csv file created earlier manually and when I try to get  an <code>XSSFWorkbook</code> object for that it works fine.<br>  I am trying to compare the content of these two files, But I am not able to read both the files. The one created in the script throws the above exception.</p>  <p>Why does that happen and how can I get an <code>XSSFWorkbook</code> for the first .csv?</p>
