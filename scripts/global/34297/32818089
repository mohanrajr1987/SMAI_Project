<p>I am developing a BIRT report which uses Apache POI when export the report to excel by the excel emitter uk.co.spudsoft.</p>  <p>I can reference a sheet which is already created from another sheet. But referencing a cell from a sheet which is not generated, makes out of range error by Apache POI. But in Excel we have this options.</p>  <p>How can I solve without arranging the Excel sheet order?</p>
