<p>I've just began reading the Apache POI <a href="https://poi.apache.org/spreadsheet/quick-guide.html" rel="nofollow">Busy Developer's Guide</a> and am looking for a way to set values to specific cells. For instance, I want to set a value to cells B5, C10, D15, etc. </p>  <p>Does POI support accepting these parameters?</p>  <p>Something like:</p>  <pre><code>Row row = sheet.createRow(3); row.createCell(C10).setCellValue("myValue"); </code></pre>
