<p>I'm kinda new to manipulating excel files. Here's my problem. I have column 'x' on sheet 'Z' which is populated with data and has a formula (Sum). I need to copy that formula on the next column 'x+1', same sheet, after which I need to populate it with data from a result set and I don't really know how to do it (Copying the formula on the next column, that is). I only found how to manipulate cells or rows, but this is about a pretty large amount of data. Anyone have been through this so far? </p>
