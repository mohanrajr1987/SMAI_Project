<p>Last night I tried installing Numpy on Windows 8. I have Python 2.7.10 installed on my Windows 8.1 Pro machine. Initially I realized that the only way to easily install Numpy is to install the 1.3 version[1] , which is pretty old. Then I found out that pip can install Numpy, but since my OS is a 64-bit one I cannot use pip directly and have to first deal with Cython, Fortran and other stuffs' installation [2]. In the end I followed the instruction given in [3] and [4] but the error that I get is non of the errors described in [3]. I may mention that I upgraded "wheel" to the latest version before downloading the <strong>unofficial</strong>, compiled Numpy file downloaded from [5]. The error message that I get is as follows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>numpy-1.9.2+mkl-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on   this platform.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Could you please help me how I can resolve this issue?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>  <p>[1] <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517129/python-how-do-i-install-scipy-on-64-bit-windows">Python: how do I install SciPy on 64 bit Windows?</a></p>  <p>[2] <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26657334/installing-numpy-and-scipy-on-64-bit-windows-with-pip">Installing NumPy and SciPy on 64-bit Windows (with Pip)</a></p>  <p>[3] <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows?rq=1">How to install pip on Windows?</a></p>  <p>[4] <a href="https://gehrcke.de/2015/02/how-to-set-up-a-64-bit-version-of-numpy-on-windows/" rel="nofollow">https://gehrcke.de/2015/02/how-to-set-up-a-64-bit-version-of-numpy-on-windows/</a></p>  <p>[5] <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy" rel="nofollow">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy</a></p>
