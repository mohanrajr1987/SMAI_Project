<p>I'm trying to perform some <code>64 bit</code> additions, ie:</p>  <pre><code>a = 0x15151515 b = 0xFFFFFFFF c = a + b  print hex(c) </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that the above outputs:</p>  <pre><code>0x115151514 </code></pre>  <p>I would like the addition to be <code>64 bit</code> and disregard the overflow, ie expected output would be:</p>  <pre><code>0x15151514 </code></pre>  <p>NB: I'm not looking to truncate the string output, I would like <code>c = 0x15151514</code>. I'm trying to simulator some 64 bit register operations.</p>
