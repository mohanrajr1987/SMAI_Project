<p>I'm trying to do some multiplications and divisions with 64 bit integers. I want my results to have 64 bit, any overflow should be truncated. I've managed to get it working with multiplications:</p>  <pre><code>z = 0xed5c6911 y = 0xFFFFFFFF &amp; (z * 33)  print hex(z) print hex(y) </code></pre>  <p>This outputs:</p>  <pre><code>0xed5c6911 0x98e98b31 </code></pre>  <p>as expected.</p>  <p>I would like to reverse this now:</p>  <pre><code>z = 0xFFFFFFFF &amp; (y / 33) print hex(z) </code></pre>  <p>I would expect <code>0xed5c6911</code>, the original value of <code>z</code>, but I am getting <code>0x4a23a85</code>. </p>  <p><strong>How can I reverse the operation done in the first snippet and retrieve the original value of <code>z</code> from <code>y</code>?</strong></p>
