<p>I have a working code </p>  <pre><code>  NSRange range = NSMakeRange(0, [arguments count]);   void *argList = malloc(sizeof(NSObject *) * [arguments count]);   [arguments getObjects:(id*)(const id *)argList range:range];    //printf("hello....%lu...",sizeof(argList));   retVal = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:formatString arguments:argList ];   free(argList);` </code></pre>  <p>it is working fine on 32 bit device,but its crashing on 64 bit devices. The only thing I can debug is that the size of argList is taking 8 byte space in 64 bit and 4 bytes in 32 bit devices. Have anybody faced this issue? Thanks in advance</p>
