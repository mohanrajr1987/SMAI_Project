<p>I am not able to print a txt file using a simple lpr.exe command and no diagnostic information or errors are logged in event viewer.There is no clue of what is going on. Below is the command which I am using:</p>  <pre><code>lpr.exe -S localmachinename -P priPrinter c:\Folder1\printtest.txt </code></pre>  <p>where priPrinter is a virtual printer and a print preview program. The same works in windows client OS (windows 7, 8.1). I have installed the LPD service from the server manager which I believe is the only pre-requisite for using lpr.exe.</p>
