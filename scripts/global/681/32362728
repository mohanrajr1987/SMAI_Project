<p>I create a new C# Windows Form project in Visual Studio 2013 Update 5. I do not change it in any way. It debugs properly as usual. As soon as I change the Platform target to x64, the debugger shows this error:</p>  <p><strong>System.AccessViolationException was unhandled Message: An unhandled exception of type 'System.AccessViolationException' occurred in System.Windows.Forms.dll Additional information: Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.</strong></p>  <p>This happens in every 5 times of debugging. Do you have any idea on what may be causing this error and how it can be fixed?</p>
