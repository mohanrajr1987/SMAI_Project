<p>I have an MFC/C++ application which exposes C++ objects in memory via COM. And there are tons of scripts written in Python and VBA. Everything worked well until we migrated the application to 64 bit. Many of the VBA projects created have forms with ActiveX controls that are not supported in 64 bit e.g MSCOMCTL.OCX MSCHART.OCX etc. and I get "Could not load an object because it is not available on this machine" error.</p>  <p>I see some posts here along same line, but could not find a good answer. </p>  <p>What is the best way to re-write these VBA projects ? Are there are 3rd party 64 bit compatible controls to replace all the controls provided by MSCOMCTL.OCX (progress bar, tree-view, slider, status bar etc) ? </p>  <p>I am using VBA 7.1 now. Scripts without these ActiveX controls work fine on 64 bit. </p>
