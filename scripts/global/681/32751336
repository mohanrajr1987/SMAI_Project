<p>Is there any way to make my .NET application use either 32 bit or 64 bit reference, depending on whichever one is available on the running environment? </p>  <p>I've a <strong>MSIL</strong> built application that currently references the 32-bit version of Oracle.DataAccess, because that's the version installed on my machine. Problem is, some machines only have 64-bit Oracle.DataAccess installed. Is there a way to set my application so that it dynamically references the available dll, regardless of its word size?</p>
