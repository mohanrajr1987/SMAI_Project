<p>I have been developing a mobile app using Delphi XE8 and testing under the platform:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>IOS Device - 32 Bit - iPhoneOS 8.4.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now that I am happy with the app I am trying to deploy it to the app store. From what I understand, in order to do this, I have to submit a 64 bit Build. Therefore, I am trying to build my app using:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>IOS Device - 64 bit - iPhoneOS 9.0</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I compile or Build the project in 64 bit I get the error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[DCC Error] E2597 ld: warning: directory not found for option '-FC:\Users\leonard\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\SDKs\iPhoneOS9.0.sdk\System\Library\PrivateFrameworks'         ld: file not found: /usr/lib/libiconv.dylib</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried deleting and re-adding the SDK and selecting the 'Update Local File Cache' for iPhoneOS 9.0.</p>  <p>The closest thing I could find on google was this link: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16303294/xe4-deployment-error">XE4 Deployment error</a> But that did not help. There were other suggestions that dealt with xcode but they do not look like they apply to my situation either.</p>  <p>It would be appreciated if someone can offer a suggestion as to why I am getting this error and how I can fix it?</p>
