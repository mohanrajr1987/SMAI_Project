<p>I am currently trying to build an app using Tess4J to extract text from images. Currently I am using the sample code found on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/tess4j/code/200/tree/Tess4J_3/trunk/test/net/sourceforge/tess4j/" rel="nofollow">Tess4J's SourceForge site</a>.</p>  <p>I am writing the code using Netbeans 8.0.2 Using Java Source 1.8 on my Windows 7 64-bit machine.</p>  <p>I use Apache Shade plugin to bundle my app and dependencies in a single jar file. </p>  <p>When I try to run my jar file on a Linux 14.04 x64 server, I get this error.</p>  <pre><code> # # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: # #  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f2495600409, pid=10047, tid=139795625977600 # # JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_60-b27) (build 1.8.0_60-b27) # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.60-b23 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops) # Problematic frame: # C  [libtesseract.so+0x87409]  tesseract::TessBaseAPI::Init(char const*, char const*, tesseract::OcrEngineMode, char**, int, GenericVector&lt;STRING&gt; const*, GenericVector&lt;STRING&gt; const*, bool)+0x39 # # Failed to write core dump.

I am not sure why its complaining about that?</p>  <p>Is there a known issue or a special configuration that I need to make Tess4J work on linux.</p>
