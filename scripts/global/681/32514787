<p>I have looked through several similar questions and am still unable to get it to work. When I archive and upload my app to the app store, I get the error message :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>iTunes Store operation failed. Missing 64-bit support. Starting   February 1, 2015, new iOS apps uploaded to the App Store must include   64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK, included in Xcode 6 or   later. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the   default Xcode build setting of "Standard architectures" to build a   single binary with both 32-bit and 64-...</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l8dGN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l8dGN.png" alt="Error message"></a></p>  <p>As suggested in other questions/answers, I have brought my app up to recommended settings, set Standard Architectures and Valid Architectures to include arm64 (See below) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hxsJW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hxsJW.png" alt="Standard Architectures"></a></p>  <p>This did not work, I received the same error message when I tried to upload the app. I don't have any iOS devices connected to my machine while doing this. I also read that some 3rd party libraries may cause this, but I believe the only 3rd party libraries I use are Google Analytics and Google Mobile Ads, both of which I updated recently (I even tried removing Google Analytics but that did not work either). See the linked libraries section: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5dRtS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5dRtS.png" alt="Linked libraries"></a></p>  <p>After doing all of this, I am at a loss as to why the error message still comes up. I also tried deleting the Derived Data. Is there some other setting in one of the classes that could block the app from supporting 64-bit? How do I get this app to support 64-bit?</p>  <p>Questions/answers I tried previously:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29655116/ios-app-missing-64-bit-support">iOS app: Missing 64-bit support</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30603698/ios-standard-architectures-enabled-but-itunes-not-recognising-64-bit-support">iOS: Standard architectures enabled but iTunes not recognising 64 bit support</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26790554/ios-app-submission-missing-64-bit-support">iOS app submission : missing 64-bit support</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28312779/why-the-missing-64-bit-support-happened-when-upload-to-the-itunes-connect">Why the Missing 64-bit support happened when upload to the iTunes connect?</a></p>
