<p>I'm working on a program in Assembly that calls the user to input a number. The number then gets incremented by one and then printed on the screen. I just can't get it to work. Who can help me out? Keep in mind, I am very new to Assembly, that is why my code might seem dumb or messy.</p>  <pre><code>mystring: .asciz "Please enter a number\n"  formatstr: .asciz "%ld"  .global main  main:     push %rbp     movq $0, %rax            movq $mystring, %rdi         call printf          pop %rbp     call inout  inout:       subq $8, %rsp            leaq -8(%rbp), %rsi      movq $formatstr, %rdi        movq $0, %rax            call scanf     inc %rdi     call printf     jmp end  end:     movq $0, %rdi     call exit </code></pre>
