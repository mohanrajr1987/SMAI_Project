<p>Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?  I don't think this is normal behavior and the GC is obviously doing something.  This is a completely blank WPF project compiled under "AnyCPU" vs "x64" as platform target.  I'm trying to use C++/CLI with WPF which can't be compiled to "AnyCPU" - however, when I use x64 as a platform target with WPF - simply resizing the window will cause the process to expand (on my computer) to upwards of 10GB of memory.</p>  <p>This is a completely blank project.  The only thing I've done is change the platform target, entered debugging mode, and constantly resized the window back and forth:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yuFGY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yuFGY.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If anyone knows how to make a WPF project targeting x64 and whether or not I'm just stupid and there's some reason you can't do that, I'd love to know.</p>  <p>PS: I'm on Windows 10, Visual Studio Community 2015</p>  <p>EDIT: confirmed this "leak" also exists in a "published" project so it's not just some sort of artifact of interfacing WPF x64 with 32 bit Visual Studio.</p>  <p>If anyone can reproduce this, it would be nice to know.</p>
