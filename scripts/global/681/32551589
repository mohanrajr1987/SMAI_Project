<p>I'm using Anders Melander's DragDrop package.<br> It works fine in Win32 mode, but needs adjustment for 64 bit.<br> I do this by adding <code>{$IFNDEF CPUX64}</code> to comment out the references to the designIDE.  </p>  <p>However when I change the package source from</p>  <pre><code>requires   rtl,   DesignIDE; </code></pre>  <p>to</p>  <pre><code>requires   rtl   {$IFNDEF CPUX64} ,DesignIDE{$ENDIF}; </code></pre>  <p>The compiler simply throws away the DesignIDE line in the package source, leaving only:</p>  <pre><code>requires   rtl; </code></pre>  <p>Which works fine for X64, but breaks as soon as I rebuilt for 32-bit.  </p>  <p>Is there a way to have one package including design-time items for win32 with the conflicting items IFDEF'ed out for X64? Or am I forced to create a separate Runtime package for X64? </p>
