<p>Whilst working on porting a c++ cross platform (Windows &amp; Linux) 32 bit code to accommodate 64 bit environments I had the following question:</p>  <p>On a 32 bit system is it functionally correct to assign a value from an int32_t type to a ptrdiff_t type?</p>  <p>On a 64 bit system is it functionally correct to assign a value from an int64_t type to a ptrdiff_t type?</p>  <p>Out of interest: On a 64 bit system is it functionally correct to assign a value from an int32_t type to a ptrdiff_t type?</p>  <p>Context: the signed ptrdiff_t value is used in some iterator arithmetic and could possibly take on a negative value as subtraction is used in the iterator arithmetic logic. </p>
