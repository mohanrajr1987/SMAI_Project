<p>I have a winform project.</p>  <p>Procedure for Load event looks like</p>  <pre><code>private void main_form_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         MainTabControl.Appearance = TabAppearance.FlatButtons;         MainTabControl.ItemSize = new System.Drawing.Size(0, 1);         MainTabControl.SizeMode = TabSizeMode.Fixed;         MainTabControl.SelectedIndex = 0;          StartByCMD();     } </code></pre>  <p>In x64 mode all parts of code works correctly. But if I'm trying to build it in x86 mode the next situation appears: first lines of main_form_Load are executed, but debugger doesnt come in StartByCMD function. Yes, I've checked assemblies to be same platform as executable. With OnLoad overriding i've got same results.</p>
