<p>We develop a WPF application to run on Windows 7/8/10: performance is ok apart from the startup time on 64 bits Windows. It takes 20 seconds for our login dialog to become visible. On 32 bits Windows this same dialog is visible within the second.</p>  <p>We have given it a try to build x86 and run as a 32 bits application on 64 bits Windows but this did not solve.</p>  <p>What can we do to boost the startup performance of our WPF applications on 64 bits Windows client or server?</p>
