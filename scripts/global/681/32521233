<p>I'm trying to archive a content blocker application. Because the API is only available on 64 bits, I've added this in the <code>info.plist</code> of the app:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;key&gt;UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;arm64&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This value is only in the application target, not the content blocker target. When sending my application to the App Store using Xcode Organizer it returns this message: </p>  <p><code>ERROR ITMS-90503: "Invalid Bundle. Apps that have 'arm64' in the list of UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities in Info.plist must only contain the arm64 slice."...</code></p>  <p>I've checked online and this error looks new and undocumented, do you know what should I do to remove it?</p>
