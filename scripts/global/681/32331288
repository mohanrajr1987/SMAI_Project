<p>I have installed java 7 (also tried java 8) on my system, then installed Rapidminer 6 on my system. All installations were fine. Now when I tried to launch Rapidminer Studio, it has given me the error i.e.<br> <em>Java could not be launched. Probably there is not enough free memory available. Please close all other applications and try again. Errorcode: 1</em></p>  <p>Please help me in this regard. Thanks</p>
