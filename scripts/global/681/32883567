<p>We have migrated from 8i to 10g, we also have compiled all PLSQL and Pro<em>C code into 10g everything is working fine expect a Pro</em>C program.</p>  <p>When executing it gives an error:</p>  <p>ORA-01031: insufficient privileges ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_AQ", line 1</p>  <p>This Pro*C code just have an update statement, also we have not used DBMS_AQ anywhere in program as 8i did not have any advance queuing functionality.</p>  <p>I think Oracle is calling DBMS_AQ explicitly.</p>  <p>DBA's have tried to give privilege:</p>  <p>grant execute on sys.dbms_aq to user;</p>  <p>But still the same issue.</p>  <p>Please advice.</p>  <p>Thanks In Advance.</p>
