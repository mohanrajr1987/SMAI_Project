<p>First off, apologies for the vague title, but I don't really know how to phrase what I'm asking. I have a SAS dataset that gives me unit ID, job ID, and the number of employees in that unit-job combination for each of several wage bands (ie, for unit 1, job A, there are 3 employees in band A, 2 employees in band B, etc.). I want to blow this up so that I have a single employee in each row in order to measure dispersion, variance, mean, median, etc. Below is an example of what I have and what I want. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>  <p>What I have:</p>  <pre><code>data have; length id1 id2 $20; infile datalines dlm=' '; input id1 $ id2 $ a  b  c ; datalines; 123 A1 2 1 0 123 A2 0 1 1 123 A3 1 0 0 456 A1 0 3 0 456 A2 1 1 1 456 A3 1 2 1 ; </code></pre>  <p>What I want to turn it into:</p>  <pre><code>                                  ID1    IDS    Category                                    123    A1       A                                   123    A1       A                                   123    A1       B                                   123    A2       B                                   123    A2       C                                   123    A3       A                                   456    A1       B                                   456    A1       B                                   456    A1       B                                   456    A2       A                                   456    A2       B                                   456    A2       C                                   456    A3       A                                   456    A3       B                                   456    A3       B                                   456    A3       C </code></pre>
