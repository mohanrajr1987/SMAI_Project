<p>If you load the SAS Stored Process Web Application in your browser with  some standard parameters <em><code>_action=index,form,properties,execute,newwindow</code></em> you get an banner on top, an treeindex on the left and the empty frame window on the right. </p>  <p>I want to load the page with a default stored process given as parameter, so user can see something in the framewindow on first load.</p>  <p>You can add <em><code>&amp;_program=...</code></em> in the Url to give a process as parameter which will be processed, but this only works if you remove the index in the action-parameters which will remove the index-tree from the page.</p>  <p>So, is there a possibilty to load a default process and also keep the indextree? I can not change the source code, so it has to work only with url-Parameters.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/okVRL.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/okVRL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If you add <em><code>&amp;_program=...</code></em> with a path to a stored process in the url, nothing changes. If you remove parameter index from _action then, it shows the process result, but removes the indextree</p>  <p>So simply said, i am looking for a way to run a specific process in this window, without klicking it in the index-tree, but with url-Parameters... If this is not possible, i will accept it and live with it, but please no guesses...</p>
