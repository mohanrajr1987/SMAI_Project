<p>Say I have a data 'test1' that has a variable 'student_name' and English_score on it. I need to get the count of the number of students who scored more than 50 marks in 'English' from this data set. There are similar  data sets like test2, test 3, test 4 etc that also has got variable 'student_name'. I would like to get the counts on the students from these data sets as well who scored more than 50 to see the trend.  I am not able to use the array since I used a SQL statement. Is there a better way to do this? Here is my code.</p>  <pre><code>    data Sample1;     set test1;     run;     PROC SQL;     CREATE TABLE Work.Student AS      SELECT distinct s1.student_name,      FROM Work.sample1 s1     WHERE s1.English_score &gt; 50;     QUIT; </code></pre>
