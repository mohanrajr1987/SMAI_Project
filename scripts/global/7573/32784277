<p>Does anyone know how to use lag in SAS that only takes into account the last known numbers from a variable, and not missing values I.e not the "." in the following sequence: 9, 10, 8, ., 7?</p>  <pre><code>data have;   input val;   datalines; 9 10 8 . 7 ; run; </code></pre>  <p>I would like a table containing the following:</p>  <pre><code>val  want_val 9    9 10   10 8    8 .    8  7    7 </code></pre>
