<p>I have one qualitative variable ("Group") and 38 quantitative variables ( some chemical elements: Al, Mg, K, Cu...): I would like to plot a boxplot for each of those quantitative vars against the qualitative one (eg. y-axis = Al, x-axis = Group) but in a single (or few) lines of codes, instead of typing this</p>  <pre><code> proc boxplot data= Dataana.Pot; plot Al*Group; run; </code></pre>  <p>38 times with a different elements.</p>  <p>How could I do this? Thank you very much!</p>
