<p>Is there a way to read in specific parts of my data without using FIRSTOBS=?  For example, I have 5 different files, all of which have a few rows of unwanted characters. I want my data to read in starting with the first row that is numeric. But each of these 5 files have that first numeric row starting in different rows. Rather than going into each file to find where FIRSTOBS should be, is there a way I can instead check this? Perhaps by using an IF statement with ANYDIGIT?</p>
