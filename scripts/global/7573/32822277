<p>Hi I am trying to prepare a transactional data. I have  Individuals and their transaction dates. I want to sort data primarly on Customer ID and  then tranaction date. Until there it is not a big challenge, but in addition to this i require to print a new variable that states oder of every transaction by number for every individual. The final data would look like the picture at the link printed bellow. </p>  <p><a href="http://zeybekomer.blogspot.com.tr/2015/09/stack1.html" rel="nofollow">http://zeybekomer.blogspot.com.tr/2015/09/stack1.html</a></p>
