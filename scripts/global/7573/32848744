<p>I have two tables where the fields are different except for a shared key.  I need to only keep the records with keys that are in A and NOT in B.  I don't want records that are only in B or records that are in both A and B (so to exclude anything in the inner join).  </p>  <p>I see SAS SQL references to "EXCEPT" but it seems that can only be used if all fields are shared across the two tables since a key is not used.  Is there another way?</p>
