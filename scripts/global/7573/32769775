<p>I'm doing the following to get an output table that includes 0 obs rows from a specified format.  The output result works for all defined format categories EXCEPT the 'other' category, which in this case is the "null weight" of a scorecard.</p>  <pre><code>proc format;   value var03f   LOW - 75 = '79'   75 &lt;- HIGH = '39'   OTHER = '76'   ; run;  proc means data=thismonth completetypes noprint nway;         class  &amp;thisvar./PRELOADFMT ;                         by ScoreDate;         output out=way5(rename=(_freq_=count) keep=ScoreDate &amp;thisvar. _freq_ _STAT_ where=(_STAT_ = "N"));     run;     proc print data=way5 l noobs;         var ScoreDate &amp;thisvar. count;     run;  </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas why the catch all isn't showing up?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
