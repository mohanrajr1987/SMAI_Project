<p>I have a large number of files which I need to make into SAS datasets. I have the names of all the files in a SAS dataset, for example:</p>  <pre><code>doc_names 1. filename1 2. filename2       .       .       . </code></pre>  <p>So I need to access each filename, concatenate it with the path to the file and tell SAS to grab that file and make a dataset out of it.</p>  <p>For example, if I were doing this in R, it would look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>path = 'path-to-files' filenames = readLines('file-with-filenames.txt') for (i in 1:length(filenames)) {   current.file = filenames[i]   full.file = paste0(path, current.file)   data.set = read.csv(full.file) } </code></pre>  <p>It's basically <code>current.file = filenames[i]</code> portion that I can't figure out in SAS. I need to be able to make a macro variable out of a particular entry of a dataset so that I can concatenate it with the pathway and then tell SAS that it is a filename.</p>  <p>P.S., I am aware that I can create a new dataset entry which has the full pathway to the file. That is all well and good, but it isn't the heart of the problem.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help!</p>
