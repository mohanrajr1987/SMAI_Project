<p>Is there a way to select all values in a column, and then check whether the entire column includes only certain parameters? Here is the code that I have tried, but I can see why it is not doing what I want:</p>  <pre><code>IF City = "8" or    City = "12" or    City = "15" or    City = "24" or    City = "35" THEN put "All cities are within New York"; </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to select the entire column on 'City', and check to see if that column includes ONLY those 5 values. If it includes ONLY those 5 values, then I want it to print to the log saying that. But, I can see that my method checks each row if it includes one of those, and if even only just 1 row contains one of them, it will print to the log. So I am getting a print to the log for every instance of this.</p>  <p>What I am trying to do is:</p>  <pre><code>want-- IF (all of)City includes 8 &amp; 12 &amp; 15 &amp; 24 &amp; 35        THEN put "All cities are within New York." </code></pre>
