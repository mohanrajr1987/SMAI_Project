<p>I am creating a series of Excel Workbooks using EPPlus v3.1.3. When I open the newly created files, if I close it without touching anything it asks me if  I want to save my changes.  The only thing I've noticed changes if I say "yes" is that the app.xml file is slightly altered - there is no visible difference in the workbook, and the rest of the XML files are the same. I have tried both of these approaches:</p>  <pre><code>ExcelPackage p = new ExcelPackage(new FileInfo(filename)); p.Save(); </code></pre>  <p>as well as </p>  <pre><code>ExcelPackage p = new ExcelPackage(); p.SaveAs(new FileInfo(filename)); </code></pre>  <p>and both have the same problem. Is there a way to have the app.xml file output in its final form? </p>  <p>The reason this is an issue is because we use a SAS program to QC, and when the SAS program opens the files as they have been directly output from the EPPlus program it doesn't pick up the values from cells that have formulas in them.  If it is opened and "yes" is chosen for "do you want to save changes", it works fine.  However, as we are creating several hundred of these, that is not practical.</p>  <p>Also, I am using a template.  The template appears normal.</p>  <p>What is particularly strange is that we have been using this system for well over a year, and this is the first time we have encountered this issue.</p>  <p>Is there any way around this? On either the C# or SAS side?</p>
