<p>I have a mer file containing 2500 observations and 300 variables. I used proc import to read into SAS, but it only reads in 200 variables and 2500 observations. The log stated the import was successful. </p>  <p>I've tried "getnames=no" and that resulted in the import of 300 variables, but the first row contains variable names, so I would like to keep that as "getnames=yes". I've tried converting the mer file to csv and doing proc import, but I keep getting errors. Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong? I'm using SAS 9.3.</p>  <pre><code>        proc import datafile="XXX.mer"         out=xx.xxxxx dbms=dlm replace;         delimiter=",";         getnames=yes;         datarow=2;         guessingrows=5000;         run; </code></pre>
