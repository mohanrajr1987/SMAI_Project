<p>I need to manipulate longitudinal data to be able to use in a logistic regression. <p> Currently the data is:<br></p>  <pre><code>ID  Period Smoke 1     1      1 1     2      1 1     3      1 2     1      0 2     2      1 2     3      1  3     1      1 3     2      1 3     3      0 </code></pre>  <p><p> But i need to manipulate it into this form:<br></p>  <pre><code>ID    Period1Smoke   Period2Smoke    Period3Smoke 1           1              1              1 2           0              1              1 3           1              0              0 </code></pre>  <p><p> So essentially, I need to somehow combine Period &amp; Smoke, and then transpose to wide format by ID. (Also I'll need to do this across several var &amp; ~5,000 individuals.) <p> Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>
