<p>At my job there's a SAS script that connects to a Microsoft Access database to retrieve data to a flat file. I've been tasked with adapting it to connect to a SQL Server database instead. We have SAS 9.1 and I cannot update the version because that's not my decision. Here's the code that connects to the Access database (I've replaced the server name and folder names with generic tags for this post):</p>  <pre><code>proc import out=SPONSOR     datatable="SPO_LOAD_UNBLIND"    dbms=ACCESS2000 replace;    database="\\&lt;Server&gt;\&lt;Folder&gt;\&lt;Subfolder&gt;\PROCESS.mdb";    memosize=2048; run; </code></pre>  <p>What do I need to do to connect this to a SQL Server database named "DM_C0000" with the same table name as in the Access database ("SPO_LOAD_UNBLIND")?</p>
