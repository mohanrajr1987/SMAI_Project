<p>I don't understand how sas calculates the value for PATIENT , I've looked everywhere but there seems to be no documentation for how sas, calculates the formulas in the case parenthesis, I only know that when the value of PATIENT is even the CASE expression has a Boolean result of 1 , 0 or 2, but I just don't see how to get the value out of the expression, could someone please explain me?</p>  <pre><code>PROC SQL;  CREATE TABLE TESTMED AS  SELECT PATIENT,  CASE ((PATIENT/2 = INT(PATIENT/2)) +  (PATIENT = .))  WHEN 1 THEN 'Med A' WHEN 0 THEN  'Med B' ELSE 'Error' END AS DOSEGRP  LENGTH=5  FROM VITALS  ORDER BY PATIENT; QUIT;  </code></pre>
