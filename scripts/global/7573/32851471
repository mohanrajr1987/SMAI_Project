<p>I'm trying to calculate descriptive stats for a user. The macro takes the 'type' parameter. The type is a string which will be used in the code later. </p>  <pre><code>%macro descriptive_stats(data, reqvar, type, filter);     proc means data = &amp;data &amp;type$;         var &amp;reqvar;         by &amp;filter;     run; %mend descriptive_stats;   %descriptive_stats(test, &amp;num_var, 'mean', fyear) </code></pre>  <p>I'm getting the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Syntax error, expecting one of the following: ;, (, ALPHA, CHARTYPE ... </code></pre>  <p>I know why I'm getting the error. But I don't understand why the string 'mean' isn't being substituted. </p>
