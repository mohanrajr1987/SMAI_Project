<p>I am trying to export output from SAS Enterprise Guide to Microsoft Excel 2010 (.xlsx), outputting both multiple tables per sheet, and several sheets per workbook. I want to have several proc sql outputs exported to a single tab, as well as other output to several tabs within the same worksheet. I have code that allows me to do this (see below), but I can't get it to export across multiple programs within SAS Enterprise Guide. Ideally, I would like each program of my SAS Enterprise Guide process flow to export output to a different tab within the same Excel file. For example, the below code works when it is all in the same program, but I want the "ID and Age" proc sql code to be in a different program then the "Diagnosis and Treatment" code, for the purposes of my own organization.  </p>  <p>Is there a way to do this?  </p>  <p>So far when I try to split the below code into two programs, it just replaces the first output with the second, instead of creating two separate sheets.</p>  <pre><code>goptions device=actximg; /*suppresses Error*/ ods excel file="C:\Example.xlsx"  style=htmlblue options(   sheet_interval="none"    sheet_name="ID and Age"   embedded_titles='yes'  );  proc sql;title "Patient list"; select patient_id, date from data;run;  proc sql;title "Patients under 2"; select patient_id, dob, age_in_years from data where age_in_years &lt; 2;run;   ods excel options(   sheet_interval="none"    sheet_name="Diagnosis and Treatment"   embedded_titles='yes'  );  proc sql;title "Diagnosis for patients under 2"; select patient_id, diagnosis from data where age_in_years &lt; 2;run;  proc sql;title "Treatment for patients under 2"; select patient_id, treatment from data where age_in_years &lt; 2;run;  ods excel close; </code></pre>
