<p>I have the following two lines extracted from the code:        </p>  <pre><code>signon task1; rsubmit  connectwait=yes;       /*************************************************/ /*                                               */ /*       Your SAS Code here                      */ /*                                               */ /*************************************************/  options nocenter FORMCHAR="|----|+|---+=|-/\&lt;&gt;*";  ********************Read HCUP dataset into SAS*******************************;  libname mkts2013 "\\myfolder\project1"; /*data file*/ libname fov7dta "\\myfolder\project2"; </code></pre>  <p>It is working in the past, but now it does not work. The problem is in the above two libname statements. Does anyone know what is going on? Many thanks for your time and attention. </p>
