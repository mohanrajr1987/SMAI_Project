<p>I have a SAS program that has a base year of data and five forecast years.  All the forecast years have the same calculations, but just use the prior year's data as the base year for calculations.  I want to avoid copying the data 5 times and just changing the suffix of my variable names.  It would be great to have just one forecast year and have a do loop or an array to change the suffix of the variable names.  Here is my updated code based on your inputs:</p>  <pre><code>*Start macro loop - takes two parameters, the first year of the dataset to be created and the last year; %macro loop(year_start, year_end);    *loop over years;    %do year=&amp;year_start %to &amp;year_end;   *create macro variable for previous years;   %let prev_year=%eval(&amp;year_start-1);  DATA SchoolAidFY&amp;year_start.; Set work.forecastinputs;  * COST PER PUPIL AMOUNTS;                        L201_FY&amp;start_year.=    L203_FY&amp;prev_year.;                              L202_FY&amp;start_year.=        Round(SCPP*SPG_FY&amp;start_year.,1);            L203_FY&amp;start_year.=        Sum(L201_FY&amp;start_year.,L202_FY&amp;start_year.);                    L204_FY&amp;start_year.=    L206_FY&amp;prev_year.;                      L205_FY&amp;start_year.=        Round(TS_SCPP*SPG_FY&amp;start_year.,0.01);      L206_FY&amp;start_year.=        Sum(L204_FY&amp;start_year.,L205_FY&amp;start_year.);                L207_FY&amp;start_year.=    L209_FY&amp;prev_year.;                      L208_FY&amp;start_year.=        Round(PD_SCPP*SPG_FY&amp;start_year.,0.01);      L209_FY&amp;start_year.=        Sum(L207_FY&amp;start_year.,L208_FY&amp;start_year.);            L210_FY&amp;start_year.=    L212_FY&amp;prev_year.;                      L211_FY&amp;start_year.=        Round(EI_SCPP*SPG_FY&amp;start_year.,0.01);      L212_FY&amp;start_year.=        Sum(L210_FY&amp;start_year.,L211_FY&amp;start_year.);                L213_FY&amp;start_year.=    L215_FY&amp;prev_year.;                      L214_FY&amp;start_year.=        Round(TL_SCPP*SPG_FY&amp;start_year.,0.01);      L215_FY&amp;start_year.=        Sum(L213_FY&amp;start_year.,L214_FY&amp;start_year.);                      Run;     %end;   *end of do loop;    %mend;   *end of macro;      %loop(year_start=17, year_end=20); </code></pre>  <p>Here is the log:</p>  <pre><code>2                                                          The SAS System                           11:35 Monday, September 28, 2015  58         L215_FY&amp;start_year.=     Sum(L213_FY&amp;start_year.,L214_FY&amp;start_year.);                    59          60          Run; 61          62          63           %end; 64           *end of do loop; 65          66           %mend; 67           *end of macro; 68          69          %loop(year_start=17, year_end=20); 180: LINE and COLUMN cannot be determined.
