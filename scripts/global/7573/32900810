<p>I am new to SAS. Would appreciate any help on this one.</p>  <pre><code>Consider three variables:  FICO(Continuous) Bad(Binary) Profit(Cont)  600 1 3000  700 0 4000  450 0 6200  350 1 5600  500 1 5600  475 0 3800  625 1 7480 </code></pre>  <p>Consider same pattern for around 50000 rows. </p>  <p>There are 2 requirements. In both, grouping is done based on FICO (Consider three levels for the above example: FICO&lt;500,500>FICO&lt;620,FICO>620)</p>  <ol> <li>Is to plot average(profit) as per FICO groups.</li> <li>Is to plot bad rate as per FICO groups. (Bad rate = total no of positive bads/total no of bads).</li> </ol>  <p>Any help/guidance will be hugely appreciated! Thanks.</p>
