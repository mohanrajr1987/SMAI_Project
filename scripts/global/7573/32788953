<p>The following GPLOT procedure generates many graphs(It gives sales by different product). Say if my product has 'Sofa', 'bed', 'Chairs', it will give 3 graphs, one for sofa, one for chairs, one for bed.</p>  <p>I'd like to have all the three graphs generated to be output to one single PDF  file. I tried the following, but it only keep the last graph generated. Any ideas how I can do this?</p>  <pre><code>ODS PDF FILE= 'OUTPUT.PDF';     PROC GPLOT data = AB.TEMP;      plot sales*Months=Product; by Region; run; ODS PDF CLOSE; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
