<p>I'm using sas sgplot to plot on variable with 3 responses. I want it to plot data from 3 columns. 1st column is total counts for an entity, 2nd column is violation counts for the same entity, and the 3rd column is percent violations. I'm using proc sgplot. I give it three vbar statements one for each response. So the bars are overplayed , but the percent response places the percent values right in the middle of the bars so it looks sloppy. I would like the percent values to appear right above the bar, but not in a straight line across but right above it, since the bars are different heights. I know I need to create an anno set, but haven't done that before. Can someone please help. Here is my code for the chart I have now. Thanks</p>  <pre><code>proc sgplot data=k noborder nowall ; vbar Entity_Name / response=tot_trans_count  dataskin=GLOSS      LEGENDLABEL="Number of Transactions"  DATALABELPOS=TOP DATALABEL DATALABELATTRS=(Color=blue Family=Arial Size=10 Style=Italic Weight=BOLD )  barwidth=0.8 transparency=0.0; YAXIS DISPLAY=NONE;   vbar Entity_Name /  response=violation_count  dataskin=GLOSS      LEGENDLABEL="Number of Violations"  DATALABELPOS=BOTTOM DATALABEL  DATALABELATTRS=(Color=red Family=Arial Size=10 Style=Italic Weight=BOLD)      barwidth=0.8     transparency=0.0;     YAXIS DISPLAY=NONE;   vbar Entity_Name /  response=violation_percent  dataskin=GLOSS      LEGENDLABEL="Number of Violations"  DATALABEL  DATALABELATTRS=(Color=red Family=Arial Size=10 Style=Italic Weight=BOLD)      barwidth=0.8     transparency=0.0;     YAXIS DISPLAY=NONE;  run; </code></pre>
