<p>I'm trying to figure out a way to test to see if my control groups for email margeling campaigns will produce statistically significant re sluts.  The group counts have already been set. The control groups are refreshed monthly and not mailed email marketing communication for the month and then mailed groups are.  The definition of the segments (not sure if this makes a diffidence) is this: </p>  <ol> <li>0-12M Active customers (split by Email Only and DM/EM)</li> <li>13-24M Inactive customers</li> <li>25+M Lapsed customers</li> </ol>  <p><strong>Controls</strong></p>  <pre><code>**Segment       Description       Segment Count** 1        12M DM &amp; EM Cohort          5,000 2        13M -24mEM Cohort           5,000 3        25M Cohort                  3,000 </code></pre>  <p><strong>Mailed</strong> </p>  <pre><code>Segment      Description           Segment Count 1      12M DM &amp; EM Cohort Balance    24,476 2       13-24M Cohort Balance        25,339 3          25M Cohort Balance        26,190 </code></pre>  <p>I have some experience using Proc Power but not much. This is an example some code which I have a feeling I should use but I'm not if this is appropriate and the correct values to enter. </p>  <pre><code>proc power; twosamplefreq test=pchi sides=  alpha=  groupproportions = (         ) groupweights=(  ) ntotal =     power = .; run; </code></pre>
