<p>So I have a SAS dataset that contains information such as a persons name and address. I am trying to arrange the addresses so all the apartment information is at the end. For example:</p>  <p><code>Name              Address Jon Doe          105 Park Ave APT 500 John Smith       APT 250 1690 Heading ST Amy Squiq        102 Intel Drive APT 89 Portville </code></p>  <p>I would like to have all the addresses in the format as the first observation (Where the apartment number is at the end)</p>  <p>This is what I originally had:</p>  <pre><code>DATA list; INPUT name $1-10 address $11-50 ; DATALINES; Joe Smith 105 Park Ave APT 500 John Smith APT 250 1690 Heading ST Amy Squig 102 Intel Drive APT 89 Portville Joe Dirtt 1305 dork CT APT 845 ; RUN;      data want;   set list;   ad=findw(address, "APT");   ad2=substr(address, ad,ad+6);   ad3=substr(ad2,1,7); run; </code></pre>  <p>The problem I had with this was removing the "APT ..." in the original address. With the help from Stu Sztukowski I was able to add in a piece and the final product works. </p>  <pre><code>data want;   set list;   ad=findw(address, "APT");   ad2=substr(address, ad,ad+6);   ad3=substr(ad2,1,7);   _apt_removed = compbl(tranwrd(upcase(address),trim(ad3), '') );   new_address = catx(' ', propcase(_apt_removed), ad3); run; </code></pre>
