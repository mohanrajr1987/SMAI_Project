<p>I have a SAS-Storedprocess which does some html-output via webout.  Under some circumstances (e.G.: no data available) i want to put a custom error message and stop the process from further execution.</p>  <p>I have a makro-solution which had worked fine so far:</p>  <pre><code>%if &amp;varnobs = 0 %then %do;  data _null_;     file _webout;        put " &amp;text1";     put " &amp;text2";     put " &amp;text3";  run; ENDSAS;  %end; </code></pre>  <p>But now i was informed that the use of ENDSAS is not allowed within our company because it can have various side-effects and also can stop not only the process, but also the complete session.</p>  <p>Now i am looking for alternatives, i had also tried the abort statement with several options, but one problem there was, that abort puts an error message in the log, so that not my custom message is shown, but a sas error message. Also in the abort documentation is stated <a href="https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000230210.htm" rel="nofollow">(abort)</a>, that abort not only stops the process, but also the session.</p>  <p>I know there are programatically alternatives like if-else or goto instead of stopping the process, but that is not an option for my specific problem.</p>  <p>So the question is:</p>  <p>How to stop a stored process during execution, without stopping the session, without other side effects and without an SAS error-message? </p>
