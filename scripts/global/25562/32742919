<p>OK here is my situation. I have an address book type page (lets call it addressbook.asp for an example), on this page new rows of addresses are added every so often, this page also has a search function that can search through an address table and narrow the view. My application also has another topframe.asp page that is the same for every page. </p>  <p>What I'm trying to do is implement a notification system. I want to input the address info I want and when an address record is inputted into my address table on addressbook.asp that matches I'll get a pop up notification. The tricky part is I want this notification check running regardless of what page I'm on so I will be putting that function into topframe.asp. When a match is made, topframe.asp will create a pop up window saying there is a match and it will have a link back to addressbook.asp. </p>  <p>What I need to happen is when this link is clicked, the user is redirected to addressbook.asp and the table showing the addresses are narrowed down by the users search criteria. So I basically need to pass in the users criteria on the redirect through the link into the search form and somehow initiate submit so I can reuse addressbook.asp's original search functionality. </p>  <p>I was thinking I could use window.opener approach however the page opening the pop up isnt addressbook.asp. Is there a way to use window.opener or is there another function thats similar that will allow me to pass info to a page that is not the pop up windows parent?</p>  <p>I think the simplified version of this is I need to be able to click my link, the link redirects to addressbook.asp, my table record is passed to the search form and basically search needs to be clicked. </p>
