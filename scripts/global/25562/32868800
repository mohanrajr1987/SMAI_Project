<p>I am trying to create a little .25 second link delay along with a zooming property, to add an artistic flare to my site. In order to see the zoom, I need a small link delay. I have been trying code that I have found online but for some reason the delays just don't work.</p>  <p>Here is an example of one of the code snippets I have tried.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#" onclick="setTimeout(window.document.location='http://******.net/html/****.html',250);"&gt;CONTACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas as to why it isn't working? Keep in mind that I only want a few links on the page to have this delay so a block of JavaScript or jQuery that assigns all <code>a href</code> links with a delay is not ideal. </p>  <p>This is a Classic-ASP project using Vb-script.</p>
