<p>I'm assigned the task of implementing session checking for a Classic ASP application. I don't want to include session checking on every single page. </p>  <p>I'd rather use something that's akin to a servlet or servlet filter in Java. The problem is I don't know of any implementation in Classic ASP which approximates this effect. Must I check for an existing session in each and every page or is there something I can do on an application-wide level which will check the request?</p>  <p>I was thinking of creating a URL rewrite rule which forwards every request to a page which checks the session and either redirect if there is no session or forwards the user to the requested URL if a session exists. Any ideas or thoughts would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you. </p>
