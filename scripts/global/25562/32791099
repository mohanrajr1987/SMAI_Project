<p>This is more of an "ethical" question than a technical question.</p>  <p>It's very obvious why <code>Eval()</code> and <code>Execute()</code> are dangerous if you allow user-defined data/variables to get passed through them. However, I've always gotten the vibe that the use of these functions is frowned upon no matter what and are only to be used as a last resort.</p>  <p>Anyway, I've used them here and there when it can make coding more efficient and dynamic... but I always make sure I know that what gets passed through the functions are controlled and not user-defined. Would you consider this bad coding? Is there a way a hacker could take advantage of those functions even if it's not reading anything defined by <code>Request</code> or <code>Session</code> variables or any other user-defined data?</p>
