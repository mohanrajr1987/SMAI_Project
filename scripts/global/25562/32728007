<p>I have an ASP classic application that I'm migrating from a Windows 2000 to Windows 2012 Server.</p>  <p>It uses the following code to import xls files</p>  <pre><code>Set objConn = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") objConn.Open "DRIVER={Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls)}; IMEX=1; HDR=NO; Excel 8.0; DBQ=" &amp; Server.MapPath("\Imports\") &amp;"\"&amp;fn&amp; "; " </code></pre>  <p>and the following for csv files</p>  <pre><code>Set objConn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") Set objRS = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") objConn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=" &amp; strPathtoCSVFile &amp; ";Extended Properties=""text;HDR=YES;FMT=Delimited""" </code></pre>  <p>As per the answer on this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/350858/excel-odbc-and-64-bit-server">Excel ODBC and 64 bit server</a> I downloaded and installed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable</a>.</p>  <p>I've tried both the 32bit and the 64bit version of the above but neither of them work unless I change the application pool setting Enable 32-bit applications to True. If it is set to False I get the below error.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80004005' </p>      <p>[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified </p> </blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately setting it the True breaks PDF rendering in another part of that website.</p>  <p>The only viable option I have come up with so far is to set this part up under it's own application pool that is 32-bit.</p>  <p>How can I run this in 64-bit Application Pool?</p>  <p>EDIT: And before someone comes along with a dupe hammer, a related question that does not resolve the issue is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1811417/asp-running-in-64-bits-environment-with-access-database">ASP running in 64 bits environment with Access database</a></p>
