<p>I am new to SQL, PHP and ASP. However, I am trying to develop a site that enables files (image and html files) to be shared across the internet. I am unsure what would be the best server in order to operate this kind of site - be it VPS, dedicated, shared? The site will have large files being uploaded and downloaded - so a lot of bandwidth will be required, and a lot of storage capacity. The site will also have many users active, as their is a lot of interest in the sites development. I was wondering if someone would be kind enough to offer advise, and recommend a possible hosting package we could use? Thanks - any help is highly appreciated! </p>  <p>PS: the web host must not restrict or cancel subscriptions if the site reaches a certain capacity (as many hosts intend to have a 'small print' in their terms of service)</p>  <p>Also in your opinion, is Microsofts ASP better to code in for such a project, or is PHP better for a large project?</p>
