<p>We have a classic asp application that takes advantage of WDDX libraries on Windows 2003.  We are trying to update to Windows 2008r2.   We aren't updating to Windows 2012 for separate reasons.   </p>  <p>We use this library on Windows 2003 <a href="http://www.finwin.com/Dev/wddxsdk/2__Software_Libraries/Installation.html#COM" rel="nofollow">http://www.finwin.com/Dev/wddxsdk/2__Software_Libraries/Installation.html#COM</a>.   </p>  <p>I installed this same library on Windows 2008.   I was able to run command "regsvr32 wddx_com.dll" without errors.   Yet, when we run the app we are receiving the error " ActiveX component can't create object" on the line "set objExtranetWDDX = server.createobject("WDDX.Recordset")".</p>
