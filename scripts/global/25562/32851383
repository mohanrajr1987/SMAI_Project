<p>We have a set of Classic ASP websites that we are trying to integrate with VSO and Continous Deployment to Azure Web Sites.</p>  <p>Here are some details:</p>  <ul> <li>Our Solution is made up of Classic ASP Web Sites  </li> <li>We use TFS in VSO  </li> <li>When changes are checked in, we would like the changed files to be deployed to our Azure Web Site.  Not all the files, as there could be hundreds or thousands of objects.  Just the changed objects.</li> </ul>  <p>I've been scouring the web for help on this, but have come up short in two key areas:</p>  <ol> <li>How do I get just the changed files?  </li> <li>How do I deploy those changed files?</li> </ol>  <p>We use a similar (but much clunkier) process in our on-premises using a combination of SourceGear Vault (with Shadowing) and msdeploy.</p>
