<p>So we have a classic asp app that is fairly old.  Inside that app, we use an iframe and want to display a simple .net app that does some tiff viewing/paging/rotation etc.</p>  <p>I would like to keep this .net tiff viewer secure.  Only if the user is logged into the classic asp site, should they be allowed to view the .net</p>  <p>Of course, the .net app is in a separate app pool.  Any suggestions on setting up forms authentication on the .net app from classic.  Or securing the .net app.  Any advice would be great.</p>
