<p>There are no XML files containing the selectors from xsl files.</p>  <p>e.g.  <code>xsl:value-of select="/Root/City"</code></p>  <p>I downloaded the full site and did a full search of  selector and was unable to find anything, including in the database.</p>  <p>There is, however, in the bin folder few relatively large files <code>.dll</code> and <code>.pdb</code> that look compiled.</p>  <p>Where/what is this <code>/Root/...</code> directory and how can I make changes to the contents?</p>
