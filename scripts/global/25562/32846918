<p>I have a frustratingly simple problem. I've migrated a classic ASP site from a Windows Server 2003 IIS site to a shiny new 2012 R2 Server running IIS 8.5.</p>  <p>When I navigate to the home page (<a href="http://mydns/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://mydns/default.asp</a>), I get a 500 error. The IIS logs show me this error:</p>  <pre><code>GET /default.asp |4|ASP_0126|Include_file_not_found </code></pre>  <p>Looking at the default.asp page, I see the following code at the top of the file:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;%@ Language=VBScript %&gt; &lt;!-- #include file="Include/common.asp" --&gt; &lt;% dim EMAIL_ID  if Request.QueryString = "" then ... </code></pre>  <p>So, my assumption is that the error is being thrown due to the second line. In the website directory, the Include directory does exist, and there is a common.asp file inside of it.</p>  <pre><code># the default.asp page that I'm loading... E:\websites\mywebsite&gt;dir | findstr default 09/29/2015  10:30 AM             3,237 default.asp  # the common.asp page within the Include folder... E:\websites\mywebsite&gt;dir Include | findstr common 06/30/2015  10:27 AM               546 common.asp </code></pre>  <p>Any idea why I would be getting an error about a file not found when I do see it in that directory?</p>  <hr />  <p><strong>Update 1:</strong> By navigating to the common.asp page in a browser, I get the following error in IIS:</p>  <pre><code>GET /Include/common.asp |42|800a01ad|ActiveX_component_can't_create_object:_'Domain.clsAuth' </code></pre>  <p>I found <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/194801" rel="nofollow">this article</a> which helped me confirm that a DLL is missing so I am pursuing installing it on the new server.</p>  <p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I was able to find the required Domain.dll on the old server. I used <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" rel="nofollow">Dependency Walker</a> to determine that Domain.dll depended on MSVBVM60.DLL so I grabbed both of these and moved them to the new server. I registered MSVBVM60.DLL successfully using <code>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;regsvr32.exe MSVBVM60.DLL</code>, but registering Domain.dll failed. I got the following error message:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSAl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSAl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It turns out that this is the same error that you get if you try to register a file that doesn't exist. For instance, I tried to register "dummy.dll" and got the same error. It's like the system doesn't see the file. It autocompletes at the command line, but I can't register it. I also can't open it in Dependency Walker... the application says file not found. But I know it's there...</p>  <pre><code>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;dir | findstr Domain 04/27/2006  02:57 PM            24,576 Domain.dll </code></pre>  <p><strong>Update 3:</strong> The issue about registering the DLL was a 32 vs 64 bit thing. I had a 32 bit DLL in the system32 folder which is a 64 bit only folder. Once I moved it to the SysWOW64 folder (which is a 32 bit folder, go figure) I was able to register it. I also unregistered MSVBVM60.DLL from system32 and found that it was already available in SysWOW64.</p>  <p>So, this DLL issue is solved! But I'm getting the same error again due to a different include file. To be continued...</p>  <p><strong>Update 4:</strong> The final include file error was indeed a missing include file.</p>
