<p>Crazy result! after configuring Website in IIS and linking it to domain name, it supposes to be accessible via internet when  user type the domain name only like "domainname.ddns.info", but that popup this error "401 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials." However if this link clicked "domainname.ddns.info/nameOfProject/", the web can be accessiable !. I have  changed IIS authentication but still not accessible using domain name only. </p>  <p>what is the problem here?</p>
