<p>I have an asp:Datagrid that fails as I page through the results with the error message:</p>  <p>[InvalidCastException: Conversion from string "" to type 'Double' is not valid.]</p>  <p>The code behind function in particular that is generating this error is:</p>  <pre><code>If dictData.ContainsKey(sFieldName) Then     If dictData(sFieldName) = "Our Source of Data" Then         If IsNumeric(dictData(cFieldName)) Then            cost = CDbl(cost) + CDbl(dictData(cFieldName))                If cost = "" Then                    cost = 0                End If          End If     End If </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone suggest how to recast this function so that it does not fail on "" for cost?</p>
