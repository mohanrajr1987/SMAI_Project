<p>Here's a question, I'm quite new with server side scripting specially .ASP as I mostly do front end, we are currently building a single page app that have over 18 different sections, I though for better code organization and cleanness I'm planning on separating all sections on their own .asp file and then just #include them on the main .asp file. My question is, will each #include be counted as a separate http request? will this approach affect performance?</p>  <p>Any enlightenment to this fool will be greatly appreciated!</p>
