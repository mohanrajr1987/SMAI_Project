<p>I've moved my classic asp app to win 2012 R2 (IIS 8.5). This app uses COM component. I've registered this component using regsvr32 and also exported older components from II 6 to II 8.5. I can see those components in control pane->component services.</p>  <p>This app is not working properly. Code include Server.CreateObject("myCOM"); looks like it works but when I try to get objArgs["prop1"]; it doesn't work. I see this error "Server.CreateObject failed while checking permissions. Access is denied to this object." What could be potential issue?</p>
