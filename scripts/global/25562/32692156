<p>So long story short, we've got a mobile project for all our mobile users i.e. Mobile &amp; Tablets but we're looking at implementing a way to show a homepage based on if you're visiting from a mobile or from a tablet.</p>  <p>Is there anyway to do this on an application level as we've got the mobile redirect setup in IIS already which picks up if the user is on a mobile device in general and redirects. </p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
