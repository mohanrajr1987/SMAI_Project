<p>I'm not sure how to describe what I'm looking to do so I mocked it up in Balsamiq (see below):</p>  <ul> <li>A series of user portraits, most likely in a Listview</li> <li>When the user swipes left, the row expands leftward like a drawer, to reveal more information and potentially an icon.</li> </ul>  <p>Anyone implement this before? Are there any pre-existing libraries, or design patterns out there?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P8Qqy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P8Qqy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
