<p>Suppose we are building one-page app with two views: list view and detail view.</p>  <p>In list view, we present a list of objects with just their names and maybe some more minimal data.</p>  <p>In detail view, we present all possible fields of particular object.</p>  <p>Hence the question: when we GET <code>/api/items/</code>, should we or should not to JSON-encode <strong>all</strong> fields of the objects listed, or just those presented in list view?</p>  <p>In other words, if we show list of food like</p>  <pre><code>Name     Price Potato   1 Milk     2 </code></pre>  <p>does our API need to respond with JSON like this:</p>  <pre><code>{      [          {              "name": "Potato",              "quantity": "1 kg",              "origin": "Egypt",               "manufacturer": "Egypt Farmers",              "price": 1,              "packaging": "String bag",              "_type": "Food"          },          {              "name": "Milk",              "quantity": "1 litre",              "origin": "Finland",               "manufacturer": "Valio",              "price": 2,              "packaging": "Tetra Pak",              "_type": "Food"          },     ] } </code></pre>  <p>or like this:</p>  <pre><code>{      [          {              "name": "Potato",              "price": 1,              "_type": "Food"          },          {              "name": "Milk",              "price": 2,              "_type": "Food"          },     ] } </code></pre>
