<p>I'm using TortoiseHG (Mercurial). </p>  <p>I can commit my project to a local repository, but I cannot push my project to bitbucket. When I push my project, the system is starting push, but this action will have not finished. I have such screen:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cx11M.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cx11M.jpg" alt="THG Main Screen"></a></p>  <p>Next, I tried to recreate the repository on my hardDrive in the following way:  I copied <code>.hg</code> to another directory and push again. But I have the same problem.</p>  <p>I tried to recreate free repo on my bitbucket and after it I push my repo to cloud. But I still see the same problem.</p>
