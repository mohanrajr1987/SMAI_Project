<p>I've beyondcompare licence for my windows machine and I can't use that licence for linux installation. I work on linux server via putty from my windows system.</p>  <p>I could launch linux visual merge tools like meld using X server. But I'm looking for a way to use X server/X11 to launch beyondcompare from my putty session. In short, I want to launch a windows application itself from the linux env over putty.</p>  <p>My last choice would be to pull changes to my windows machine and do a merge on windows; push it back. But it would be nice if I could launch beyondcompare from linux.</p>  <p>Any Ideas?</p>
