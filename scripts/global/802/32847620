<p>Sometimes when merging two branches in a Mercurial repository all symbolic links get corrupted, the resulting file is a file containing the path to the file instead of a proper symbolic link. This renders a failed build since the compiler will try to parse and build the file containing a path to the file it should have been compiling, hence compiling fails. Usually this renders all of the CocoaPods used corrupted and in some cases some of the pre-compiled frameworks that are stored in the repo are also corrupted - the fix is to perform a fresh install of pods <em>pod install</em> or sometimes just <em>pod update</em> will do. The same goes for pre-compiled frameworks, these have to be imported again into the project and hence overwriting the corrupt framework's files.</p>  <p>Is there any way to solve this without migrating from Mercurial?</p>
