<p><em>I know this has been asked in the past, but those questions are a few years old so I figured there might be some new information.</em></p>  <p>I'm working at a company that's not a software company but we also have a few programmers. Today we are using a visual svn server to host our repositories and tortoiseSVN to interact with the repositories. I'm not a big fan of subversion since I want to be able to commit without updating/merging, so I've proposed a change to mercurial instead.</p>  <p>We still want to run a server with all the repositories on our own network so we want something that looks like this. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tRfgX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tRfgX.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>It would also be nice if there was a way to browse the repositories through a web browser so that our non programmers can also access the repositories. I've searched for quite a bit to see if I can find a mercural version of visual svn server but I haven't had much luck. I found this thing called HgLab which looks nice, but might be a bit overkill for our needs.</p>  <p>So to my question. Does anyone know a mercurial equivalent of visual svn server that's pretty straightforward to setup on a windows server?</p>
