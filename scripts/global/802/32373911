<p>I am attempting to add an existing Mercurial bitbucket repo to a clean installation of TeamCity. I have tried multiple repos including one created from scratch just a test. I have attempted to do this on two separate installations of TeamCity on two different machines from two different physical locations.</p>  <p>I have tried specifying the Hg Command within TeamCity as 'Hg' as well as the actual path to both a plain Mercurial install and a TortoiseHg install.</p>  <p>Each time TeamCity attempts to check out the repo it fails, with this error:</p>  <pre><code>Failed for the root '"mercurial: https://bitbucket.org/xxxxx"  {instance     id=12, parent internal id=2, parent id=xxxxx, description: "mercurial: https://bitbucket.org/xxxxx"}: 'hg init' command failed. stderr: abort: repository . already exists!  </code></pre>  <p>I have been able check out Git repos with no issue. Is it me, or should TeamCity not even be calling 'hg init'? I would very much appreciate some assistance on this problem.</p>
