<p>After creating new "master" repository in mercurial I used to always run </p>  <pre><code>hg update 00 </code></pre>  <p>(it would only work with more one 0 ...)</p>  <p>This would remove all (tracked/committed) files and folders from repository folder but not the repository and only leave .hg folder.  I've learn this from my colleague in previous job and used it ever since. I like the cleanliness about the folder and used it only for master repository which is not edited directly (only cloned).</p>  <p>What this command actually does and what is its alternative in GIT (if any)?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
