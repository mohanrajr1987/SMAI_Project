<p>I'm very new to Mercurial, I have worked with SVN before, but now I installed Mercurial as a local version control system. Now what I want to achieve is to have my IDE project folder in for example <code>C:\Projects\</code> and my Mercurial repo in <code>C:\Repo\</code>. The thing is I only want to keep <code>.cpp</code> and <code>.h</code> files in my Repo and the rest including the source files in my projects folder. Is it possible to have something like this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
