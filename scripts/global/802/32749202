<p>I have several repositories that I am building a tool to interact with.  I have not been able to find a way to grep a specific file in a specific revision that was unchanged in that revision.</p>  <p>The help for <code>hg grep</code> says that the <code>-r</code> option <code>-r --rev REV [+]         only search files changed within revision range</code>.  If I update the revision in question, I can grep appropriately, and I get the desired results.  Because my file in question is unchanged in that revision, it will not get grepped.  Does anyone know a way to do this?</p>  <p>My end goal is that I would like to ignore files that meet a certain pattern matching.  I am not sure that using the <code>--all</code> option would be feasible, because I would have to parse the revisions that the pattern appeared and disappeared in.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p><strong>edit:</strong> Actual problem I'm trying to solve:</p>  <p>There are several tagged revisions in a repository.  </p>  <p>For each of those tagged revisions, I would like to extract a particular file (assume <code>source/a.c</code> or something like that) to a folder structure that others can access (a website for those outside of our group, whom we cannot give repository access to).</p>  <p>But, I would only like to extract the file if it does not contain a particular pattern.  This is why I would like to check the file at a specific revision, even if it has been unchanged.</p>
