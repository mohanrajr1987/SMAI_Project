<p>I'm running into an error when pushing a local repository to the master repository located on a network share in Windows 7. I've added a hook on the master repository to perform "hg update" on push. When I'm running push from the local repository in the TortoiseHg, I get this error in the console:</p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "c:\Python26\lib\site-packages\py2exe\boot_common.py", line 92, in &lt;module&gt; ImportError: No module named linecache Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;install zipextimporter&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; ImportError: No module named zipextimporter Traceback (most recent call last):   File "hg", line 10, in &lt;module&gt; ImportError: No module named os warning: changegroup hook exited with status 255 </code></pre>  <p>The push happens, but does not successfully execute the hook. Furthermore, it seems I get this error all the time I run the "hg" command in the command line, except when running it inside the C:\Program Files\TortoiseHg directory. I've put the "C:\Program Files\TortoiseHg" in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, but without any success. The system is Windows 7 x64.</p>  <p>In general TortoiseHg seem to work, like commit, update, push, pull... But finer details like hooks seem to not work. I've installed Tortoise 3.5.1 ONLY, without any Mercurial or Python. Here is where I've installed it from:</p>  <p><a href="http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/files/downloads/tortoisehg-3.5.1-x64.msi" rel="nofollow">http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/files/downloads/tortoisehg-3.5.1-x64.msi</a></p>  <p><a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/download/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/download/index.html</a></p>  <p>Can somebody help me? I've seen a similar question on StackOverflow, but the person had both Mercurial and TortoiseHg installed.</p>  <p>So, why do I get these errors when running hg in the command line? Why pushing from TortoiseHg GUI doesn't successfully execute the hook on the remote repository?</p>
