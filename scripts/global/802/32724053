<p>I recently discovered the Local History feature in Eclipse, I also believe intelliJ IDEA, and Netbeans have a similar feature.</p>  <p>Essentially </p>  <blockquote>   <p>every time an editable file is saved eclipse updates the local history   of that file and logs the changes that have been made. The local   history of a file can then be accessed and a previously saved copy of   the file can be reverted to, as long as the desired state is recent   enough in the save history</p> </blockquote>  <p>see <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2FgettingStarted%2Fqs-55.htm" rel="nofollow">description</a>.</p>  <p>basically it's pretty awesome. I would like to implement something very similar in my own text editor, but I would like to use Mercurial(Hg) to do it.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Is it even possible to create a private repository that doesn't get shared</p></li> <li><p>How can I create a private branch, that never gets shared<br> but is still visible to me so I can see/search/navigate my<br> changeset</p></li> </ul>  <p>Has anyone ever tried this. Any pointers I'm using python 2.10/pyqt4 on windows.</p>
