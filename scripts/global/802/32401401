<p>I'm aware of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17497455/mercurial-any-command-or-python-api-to-get-repository-name">this answer</a> and maybe there is no solution to my problem in the end anyway. However, what I want to achieve is this:</p>  <p>Whenever a changeset for a repo on my server is incoming, I want to perform some custom tasks. I added a <code>hooks</code> section to <code>hgweb.config</code>:</p>  <pre><code>[hooks] changegroup = printenv &gt; /tmp/test/env.txt </code></pre>  <p>From the info that <code>printenv</code> gives me I see that I'm able to extract my unique identifier for the repo, but not the name of project! I do need the name of the repo's root folder for an API call. Is there any way I can get this information?</p>
