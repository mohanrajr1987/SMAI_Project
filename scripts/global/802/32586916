<p>I am using Tortoisehg and my repo is located on a network drive.  All files except one folder have been previously committed to the repo.</p>  <p>I right clicked on the network drive directory and selected Hg Commit</p>  <p>Immediately after the Hg Commit application starts, a dialog pops up showing "failed to refresh [Errno 13: Permission denied]"</p>  <p>How can I fix this issue?</p>
