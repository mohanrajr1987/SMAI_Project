<p>I have been trying to solve this problem for several days.  The hgweb mailing list provided no useful clue.  I am going to try that later.  </p>  <p>I got authentication failure when tying to do hg push. All other functionality works.  I have read many posts and changed the permission of the repository to www-data, done all the proper configuration.  Even add 401.html 403.html and 404.html documents to .htaccess file.  </p>  <p>If I put the correct passwords the apaches error.log will not show any entry but I still got authentication failure.  If I intentionally put a wrong password, I will see the error in the error.log file.  So everything seems to be set up correctly.  My hgserver is pretty recent.  My hg client is old.  So I complied the latest version (version 3.5.1+0-0dda3692ec9b).  The problem still persists.</p>  <p>I am just about to conclude that hg is a piece of trash and switch to git.</p>  <p>Is there any expert in this forum.</p>
