<p>I have a pretty large folder (with many sub folders) on a mercurial repository. I was a bit too fast with my first commit so I added a lot of files that i now realize shouldn't be on version control. I've updated my .hgignore file accordingly but all the old files are still version controlled. Is there a command that I can write in the root directory that forgets all files that are in a folder of a specific name. These folder names exist in a lot of places and i want them all forgotten with one command since it would take a long time to go through them all manually and forget the folders/files</p>  <p>I guess it would maybe look something like this: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>hg ignore ../folderName/</p> </blockquote>
