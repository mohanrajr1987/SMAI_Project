<p>We've all been there at some point -- you move a file using something other than Mercurial's <code>hg move</code> command and commit and push your changes only to realize your mistake much later. Is there any way to later inform Mercurial that there is a relationship between the "old" path and the "new" path?</p>  <p>I've tried playing with <code>--after</code> but that just seems to error out unless you happen to catch the problem before committing the problem changeset:</p>  <pre><code>  &gt; hg move OLD_PATH NEW_PATH --after   OLD_PATH: The system cannot find the file specified   abort: no files to copy </code></pre>  <p>In my particular situation, this change was committed by a coworker across a messy private branch (or two) and then merged to our <code>default</code> branch and pushed to our main repo, so it's already spread out to the entire team.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
