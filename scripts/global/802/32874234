<p>I have the following section in my <code>~/.hgrc</code> file. Other settings there work perfectly well.</p>  <p>However this:</p>  <pre><code>[committemplate] changeset = {desc}\n\n     HG: Enter yo commit message.  Lines beginning with 'HG:' are removed.     HG: {extramsg}     HG: --     HG: user: {author}\n{ifeq(p2rev, "-1", "",    "HG: branch merge\n")    }HG: branch '{branch}'\n{if(activebookmark,    "HG: bookmark '{activebookmark}'\n")   }{subrepos %    "HG: subrepo {subrepo}\n"              }{file_adds %    "HG: added {file}\n"                   }{file_mods %    "HG: changed {file}\n"                 }{file_dels %    "HG: removed {file}\n"                 }{if(files, "",    "HG: no files changed\n")} </code></pre>  <p>Which I copied from <a href="https://selenic.com/hg/help/hgrc" rel="nofollow">selenic page about hgrc</a>, and added the <code>yo</code>, to see if it worked. It didn't. I'm using mercurial 3.5, downloaded and installed today from <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/</a></p>
