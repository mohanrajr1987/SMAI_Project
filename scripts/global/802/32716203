<p>I'm sure we've all done that thing where you temporarily hot-wire part of your application while you test something. We really don't want to <em>commit</em> such changes though.</p>  <p>Usually I mark such lines with a comment reminding me not to commit this change. But is there some way I can program Mercurial itself to refuse to commit any line containing a certain text fragment? (Not the entire file, just the marked line.) Is there some extension or something that does that?</p>
