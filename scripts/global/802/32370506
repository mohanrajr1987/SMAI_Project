<p>I use <code>default</code> as the production branch, from which I create new branches when developing new features, which I ultimately merge into <code>default</code> (or close if this is a dead-end). I have trouble understanding the situation I am in. When trying to push the following repo, I get a "won't push several heads" message (from TortoiseHG)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fWvZT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fWvZT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My situation is the following:</p>  <ul> <li>I want <code>390</code> to be the <code>default</code> (production) rev</li> <li>What happened between <code>387</code> and <code>388</code> was, retrospectively, a mistake. I should not have merged into default as the changes were not good enough. I will work on it later, but right now I do not want to deal with it, nor want it to mess with <code>390</code>. Is that the other head TortoiseHG is complaining about?</li> </ul>  <p>I do not want to force anything (been there, done that, suffered) so what is the appropriate action in such a case?</p>
