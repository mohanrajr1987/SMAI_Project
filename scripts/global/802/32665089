<p>I am new to mercurial, and I am having trouble understanding resolving conflicts when I attempt to merge with the local branch.</p>  <p>I have a repository that a 3rd party has pushed changes to.</p>  <p>I committed my changes and then pulled the changes by the 3rd party - as advised by TortoiseHG.</p>  <p>When I tried to merge with local, I have the following screen asking me to resolve the conflicts:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kaFNz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kaFNz.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I am really uncertain what to do here. </p>  <p><strong>What option do I select to merge the pushed 3rd party files to my local files and also keep my committed changes?</strong></p>  <p>This may be a ridiculously simple question to ask, but I am concerned that I will make the wrong selection and overwrite the wrong files, which I have seen happen before (on a different project) and it proved to be a minor disaster. I want the 3rd party files to be committed to my local branch.</p>  <p>The files that I committed before I pulled the 3rd party files held only minor changes and can be overwritten if they really need be.</p>  <p>I have read the docs, but this only confused me.</p>
