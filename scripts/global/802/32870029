<p>On Server, running mercurialserver, I have two repos, repoA and repoB.</p>  <p>On Client, I am able to clone and pull from both repoA and repoB.</p>  <p>But on Client, I am only able to successfully push to repoA.  </p>  <p>When I try to push to repoB, I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>[user]@virtual-ci:~/[repoB]$ hg push -f -r tip pushing to ssh://hg@[server_address]/[repoB] searching for changes searching for changes remote: adding changesets remote: adding manifests remote: adding file changes remote: added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files (+1 heads) remote: error: pretxnchangegroup.access hook failed: mercurialserver.access: access denied for changeset c8dfb58454d4 remote: transaction abort! remote: rollback completed remote: abort: mercurialserver.access: access denied for changeset c8dfb58454d4 [user]@virtual-ci:~/[repoB]$ </code></pre>  <p>I'm on the same account, and thus using the same mercurialserver ssh key, as when I'm successfully pushing to repoA.</p>  <p>I looked at the file permissions on Server at the files and directories of the two repositories, and they look the same.</p>  <p>Why might it allow me to push to one repo and not another?</p>
