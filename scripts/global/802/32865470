<p>I've been working on an (open source) QT project that was previously using mercurial for source control. The project has moved onto using git. Or at least is moving onto git.</p>  <p>So I have taken a copy of the project and used hg2git to generate a git directory (pro tem) and then removed the .hg directory. Now whenever I open the (copy of the) project with QT Creator it complains that it can't find the .hg directory. This isn't particularly surprising given it isn't there, but I can't find anywhere I can change to tell QT Creator that this particular project isn't using mercurial.</p>  <p>Is there some project setting I'm missing? I have other projects still using mercurial and don't want to switch it off for everything.</p>
