<p>While trying to use the 'hg commit --amend' feature for change the commit message in repo ...</p>  <p>I have created the new branch named as 'hg_amend' and i have commited some changes and pushed to repo. Again i need to do some changes related to that previous commit. So i did some changes &amp; tried to add that files using 'hg add', 'hg commit --amend', 'hg phase --draft --force .' and 'hg push -f'.</p>  <p>After this i checked in bitbucket, the new branch created with same heads.</p>  <p>Advance Thanks !!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X7Pkj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X7Pkj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dwge7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dwge7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
