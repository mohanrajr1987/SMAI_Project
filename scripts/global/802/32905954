<p>I have created a fork of repository A in Bitbucket, and named it repository B1.</p>  <p>Repository A has branch default, branch1 and branch2.</p>  <p>I created a copy of A on my machine that has only branches default and branch1, let's call it A2.</p>  <p>There was an error with my repository and I had to delete repository A (which is the parent for fork B), from Bitbucket, thus leaving fork B without a parent.</p>  <p>I uploaded repository A2 on Bitbucket with the name A.</p>  <p>My question is: How can I make repository A be the parent of fork B, so i can use Bitbucket's sync parent option?</p>  <p>ps: I use mercurial as source control.</p>
