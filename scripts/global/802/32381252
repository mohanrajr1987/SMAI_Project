<p>I use TortoiseHg and I have folders structure, as below:</p>  <pre><code>testSet1      test1           filesystem                     input_1.obj                     output_1.obj           etalon_1.obj           result_1.obj      test2           filesystem                     input_1.obj                     output_1.obj           etalon_1.obj           result_1.obj      ......      errors.txt ...... result.xml </code></pre>  <p>I need to ignore only .obj files located in directories "testSetN/testN", but not in directories "testSetN/testN/filesystem". I use glob pattern "*/*/*.obj" in .hgignore, but it doesn't work. Mercurial just ignores all .obj files in all directories (including "filesystem" directory). But if I use, for example, "testSet1/*/*.obj", then everything works fine. How can I do what I need? It's not necessary for me to use only glob syntax. I would be grateful for any way.</p>
