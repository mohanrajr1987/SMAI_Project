<p>I have an existing mercurial alias (for closing and merging feature branches) written in bash. The problem is, that my colleagues with windows machines cannot use it. Mercurial is already delivered with Python, so question is whether it is possible to call python code in the alias. Then it would be OS independent.</p>  <pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>[alias] close-feature = ![ -z "$1" ] &amp;&amp; echo "You have to specify the issue number!" &amp;&amp; exit 1; \         if hg branches | grep -q "fb-$1"; \             then $HG up fb-$1; $HG commit -m 'Close branch fb-$1.' --close-branch; $HG pull; $HG up default; $HG merge fb-$1; $HG commit -m 'Merge branch fb-$1 -&gt; default.'; \             else echo "The branch fb-$1 does NOT exist!"; \         fi </code></pre>
