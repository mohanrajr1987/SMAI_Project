<p>I would like to abandon all changes in my bookmark and delete the bookmark itself.  I tried the instructions under: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4957721/mercurial-how-to-discard-all-local-changes-including-to-unversioned-files">Mercurial - How to discard all local changes including to unversioned files?</a>  i.e hg --revert .  In addition, I looked at <a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Bookmarks" rel="nofollow">https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Bookmarks</a> where it says that the delete feature still leaves changed files. How do I go to a state where I can start afresh from the contents of the remote repository?</p>
