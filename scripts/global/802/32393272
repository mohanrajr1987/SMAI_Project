<p>I'm trying to convert a subversion repository to mercurial a one and at this point I'm just banging my head against the wall. </p>  <p>On the current windows server the following programs are installed:  Visual SVN Server, TortoiseHg, Python2.7</p>  <p>In my console I run the command </p>  <blockquote>   <p>hg convert [dest] [source]</p> </blockquote>  <p>Which gives a lot of errors about the repository being of different types and also this</p>  <blockquote>   <p>could not load Subversion python bindings</p> </blockquote>  <p>After some googling I found that those bindings are supposed to be included with TortoiseHg, but as I already mentioned I have TortoiseHg installed and it's still not working. I then tried to download the svn python bindings and read somewhere that I should add them in the Python27/Lib/site-packages directory but it's still not working. I think that I maybe have to recompile those bindings with python or something, but I've never used python so I'm pretty lost</p>
