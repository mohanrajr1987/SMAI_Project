<p>I was reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/devguide/gitdevs.html#bookmarks" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>.  In the section about Mercurial's bookmarks system, I read this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Bookmarks can be used as an alternative to NamedBranches for tracking   multiple lines of development. Systems like Mercurial, CVS, and   Subversion store their branch information as a permanent part of each   commit. This is useful for future auditing of long-lived branches, as   it’s always possible to identify which branch a commit was introduced   on. Git, by contrast, has “branches” that are not stored in history,   which is useful for working with numerous short-lived feature   branches, but makes future auditing impossible.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried searching the web for "future auditing" pertaining to mercurial, but almost every article has the exact same text as quoted above, as if they all ganked this documentation from the same place.</p>  <p>What is this mysterious "future auditing" that is supposedly impossible in git?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
