<p>I have a weird problem. I have my main repository on a shared drive within my LAN (not connected to the internet). Then I have my work station (connected to the LAN only, no internet). I recently merged 2 "main" repositories into only one, then I made sure the new merged "main" repo has only one head, has not uncommitted changes, and there is nothing pending on it.</p>  <p>Then on my work station, I cloned from "main" (on the shared drive) to my local drive (through TortoiseHG 3.1.1). After clone completes, I go into the cloned folder, click on "commit", and there is a number of files supposedly modified (with the red icon), but I just opened the folder and have not even opened any files yet, so how could I have modified files yet?.</p>  <p>Then I repeat the clone, but this time I clone into the same share drive where "main" resides. I open up the cloned folder and see the same thing (files with red icons), I click on "commit" and the same "modified" files are listed there.</p>  <p>The weird thing is that I turn around and go to another work station (connected to both, the LAN and the outside world, if that makes a difference). Then I open the same cloned folder, but as soon as I open it, the red icons go away and all the files now are green, then I open the commit window and no files are listed there.</p>  <p>Then I go back to my first work station, open the same folder again, and now all files are green and the commit window shows no files pending!!.</p>  <p>Can someone explain what is going on???</p>  <p>I made sure that both work stations are running the same version of TortoiseHG (3.1.1.), they both are windows7.<br> I was thinking that maybe the instances of TortoiseHG are configured differently on the two work stations?  if so, how can I compare configurations?</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
