<p>I have Zend Framework 2.5.1 and for detecting locale I am using SlmLocale.  It works great, but have only one issue (may be I have missed something in setup.)</p>  <p>I am using just the uripath: SlmLocale\Strategy\UriPathStrategy for the strategy. </p>  <p>Whenever, I try to access my site say [www.example.com/en/myapp], it adds another 'en' to the url automatically [www.example.com/en/en/myapp]. Or if I default locale to say 'en' and access [www.example.com/myapp]. it still ends up with two 'en' in the URL [www.example.com/en/en/myapp]. </p>  <p>I think somewhere in the documentation it said system prepends the locale to the URI, and it makes sense for other strategies, but how can I skip this for the uripath strategy that I am using so I do not see duplicate locale.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
