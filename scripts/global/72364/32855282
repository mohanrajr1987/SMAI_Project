<p>I am creating an apigility project where we will be hosting all of our APIs.  We need to be able to use OAuth2 for authentication but we cannot figure out how to control access to certain APIs, it seems like once a client authenticates, they can use any of our APIs but we want to limit them to use only specific ones that we define. After reading about the OAuth2 library that apigility uses, I saw that there are scopes that can be defined but I have not found any documentation about how to check a user's scope to see if they have access. I want to find out if this is the best way to restrict access to certain APIs and how to set it up if it is, or is there a better way to control access?</p>
