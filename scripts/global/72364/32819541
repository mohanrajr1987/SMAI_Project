<p>I have a common class using for reusing functions of all modules. I have placed it in</p>  <pre><code>Application\Service\Utility.php  </code></pre>  <p>Now I can create an object in my controller as </p>  <pre><code>$utilObj = new Utility(); </code></pre>  <p>then call my function as <code>$utilObj-&gt;myFn();</code></p>  <p>Everything working fine. </p>  <p>But I cannot get the <code>getServiceLocator()</code> function there (Inside myFn in Utility.php). Is there any way to solve this issue. I need service locator there because I have to get the config data, doctrine management etc.</p>  <p>I haven't configured getServiceConfig in module.php.</p>
