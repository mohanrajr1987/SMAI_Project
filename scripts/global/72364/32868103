<p>started working with doctrine in ZF2 and need to delete an entity from persistence. </p>  <pre><code>$result = $em-&gt;getRepository('zmpim\Entity\Collection')-&gt;findOneBy(array('id'=&gt;$id));     $products = $result-&gt;getProducts();     $this-&gt;assertSame(1, count($products));     $this-&gt;assertSame(3, count($products[0]-&gt;getFields()));     $em-&gt;remove($result);     $em-&gt;persist($result);     $em-&gt;flush($result); </code></pre>  <p>The example is in a unit test. I would expect, that the entity is deleted after it. But the entity and some OneToMany entities are still there. </p>  <p>cu n00n</p>
