<p>Suppose </p>  <pre><code>$string  = " we will study integers &amp; functions &amp; matrices such as $$\begin{tabular}{ccc}  a     &amp; b &amp; c \\  a     &amp; b &amp; c \\   \end{tabular}$$ "; </code></pre>  <p>I would like to escape special latex characters (such as '&amp;') outside math mode while leaving all the math stuff alone, so the desired output would be:</p>  <pre><code>$string  = " we will study integers \&amp; functions \&amp; matrices such as $$\begin{tabular}{ccc}  a     &amp; b &amp; c \\  a     &amp; b &amp; c \\   \end{tabular}$$ "; </code></pre>  <p>If anyone could lead me in a good direction I would be very grateful. thx</p>
