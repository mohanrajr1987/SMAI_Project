<p>I spent hours looking at dozens of different solutions but none of them worked. I am receiving the content of a textarea in a php string and I would like to remove anything which is more than one blank line.</p>  <pre><code>Example ok Hi how are you,  // one blank line here so ok to keep Not too bad thanks  Example not ok hi how are you // two lines (or more) here so we remove one and keep the other  not too bad thanks </code></pre>  <p>Does someone know the proper preg_replace to use? Note that I don't want to modify the data (no nl2br() please) as it is easier for me to keep it raw (ios support).</p>
