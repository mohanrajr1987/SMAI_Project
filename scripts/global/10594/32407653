<p>I always have problems with strings full of weird characters that are not white spaces but they do count as an element of the string. How can I remove all this characters from the string (not removing inner spaces)?</p>  <p>I am using preg_replace, but it eliminates inner spaces which I want to keep. </p>  <pre><code>$string = preg_replace('/\s+/', '', $string); </code></pre>  <p>Php shows that "My string" has 40 elements </p>  <pre><code>string(40)=&gt;"      My string " </code></pre>  <p>And it should have only 9 just like that:</p>  <pre><code>string(9)=&gt;"My string" </code></pre>  <p>This spaces at the beginning and end of the word are not feed, enter or tab since I've used string replace just like that:</p>  <pre><code>str_replace("\r", "", $string); str_replace("\t", "", $string); str_replace(char(10), "", $string); </code></pre>
