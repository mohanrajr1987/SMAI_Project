<p>I'm trying to replace a string simultaneously with strtr but I came across a problem. If the letter being replaced simultaneously is next to another letter that is being replaced simultaneously it doesn't replace the letter after the first letter. What can I do to fix this? Thanks.</p>  <pre><code>$text = " no bacon cats nobody "; $text = strtr($text, array(" no " =&gt; " bacon ", " bacon " =&gt; " no ", " cats " =&gt; " dogs ")); echo $text; </code></pre>  <p><b> Expected Results </b></p>  <pre><code>bacon no dogs nobody </code></pre>  <p><b> Actual Results </b></p>  <pre><code>bacon bacon dogs nobody </code></pre>  <p>P.S: I have to make sure those words aren't part of another word. That's why the white spaces are there. For example, the word "no" is part of "nobody", and if you replaced all "no" in the string, it would also replace words like "nobody"; </p>
