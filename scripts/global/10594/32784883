<p>I'm using PHP to create a string filter. I need to replace some words by other words so I'm using the str_replace() function like this :</p>  <pre><code>$phrase  = "You should eat fruits, vegetables, and fiber every day."; $healthy = array("fruits", "vegetables", "fiber"); $yummy   = array("pizza", "beer", "ice cream"); $newphrase = str_replace($healthy, $yummy, $phrase); // echo -&gt; "You should eat pizza, beer, and ice cream every day."; </code></pre>  <p>So far so good but I need to replace words even if they contains several letters like this:</p>  <pre><code>$phrase  = "You should eat fruuits, vegetaaables, and fiiibeeer every day."; </code></pre>  <p>I found this example to remove double letters in a string:</p>  <pre><code>$string = preg_replace('/(\w)\1+/', '$1', $phrase); </code></pre>  <p>But if I apply this example to my string, all words with double letters will be changed... For example "Google" will become "Gogle" and I don't want that.</p>  <p>Any ideas ? Thanks!</p>
