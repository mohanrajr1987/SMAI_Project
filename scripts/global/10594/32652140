<p>I have a string with several instances of a single wildcard character:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An $X a $X keeps the $X away.</p> </blockquote>  <p>and an array with replace terms:</p>  <pre><code>["apple","day","doctor"] </code></pre>  <p>I want to replace the first wildcard with the first array value, the second wildcard with the second array value etc, giving:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An apple a day keeps the doctor away.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm sorry if this has been asked elsewhere, but I can't find any examples with a <em>single</em> search and <em>multiple</em> replaces, only multiple searches for multiple replaces, but the wildcards are not numbered so this wouldn't be suitable.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
