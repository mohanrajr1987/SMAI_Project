<p>I manage to remove the spaces but I can't understand why it would remove my returns as well. I have a textarea in my form and I want to allow up to two returns maximum. Here is what I have been using so far.</p>  <pre><code>$string = preg_replace('/\s\s+/', ' ', $string); // supposed to remove more than one consecutive space - but also deletes my returns ... $string = preg_replace('/\n\n\n+/', '\n\n', $string); // using this one by itself does not do as expected and removes all returns ... </code></pre>  <p>It seems first line already gets rid of more than one spaces AND all returns ... Which is strange. Not sure than I am doing it right ...</p>
