<p>I'm not really sure how to word the title but I'm trying to achieve the following:</p>  <p><code>$string = 'category/(.*)/page/([0-9]+)'</code> and I need to turn that into <code>category/test/page/2</code> by means of passing an array of parameters like so:</p>  <pre><code>Array (     [0] =&gt; test     [1] =&gt; 2 ) </code></pre>  <p>Doing <code>$string = preg_replace('#^'.$string.'$#', $replacements, $string)</code> results in an error about <code>$replacements</code> being an array, which matches what <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> says, however I'm not sure how else to go about it.</p>  <p>I can't really get my head around the pattern and subject begin the same string.</p>
