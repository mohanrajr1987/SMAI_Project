<p>I've got a small piece of code that needs to be updated to comply with PHP 5.6 as I'm currently getting a DEPRECATED error message. The code comes from a plugin I use and was created by someone else so I'm not sure exactly how it needs to be modified.</p>  <p>Here is the error message.</p>  <pre><code>PHP Deprecated:  preg_replace(): The /e modifier is deprecated, use preg_replace_callback instead </code></pre>  <p>Here is the piece of code.</p>  <pre><code>$messagetext = preg_replace(     '#(^|\[/(' . $skiptaglist . ')\])(.*(\[(' . $skiptaglist . ')|$))#siUe',     "convert_url_to_bbcode_callback_auto_title('\\3', '\\1')",     $messagetext ); </code></pre>  <p>I realize this needs to be updated to use <strong>preg_replace_callback</strong> however aside from changing <strong>preg_replace</strong> to <strong>preg_replace_callback</strong> I know that there are other changes that need to be made to the code, I'm just not sure exactly what.</p>  <p>I understand I could just ignore this error, however I would like someone to fix the code for me so that it will be updated to work correctly with PHP 5.6</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
