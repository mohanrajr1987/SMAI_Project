<p>hello as described from the title :<br> I have an input like this <br> <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="test[]" /&gt;</code><br> what I want to do is to remove [] from the name attribute so it will look like this<br> <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="test" /&gt;</code><br > I want to use it using regex or domdocument. thanks for the help. <br>ps : I have many input so they will be random name attribute not only test.<br> I'm using foreach() code to get all posts from a website so inputs with arrays in name attribute doesn't get submited that's why .</p>
