<p>I've a body of content that is read in and it contains numerous strings like <code>{{some_text}}</code> and what I'm trying to do is to find all these occurances and replace them with another value from an array for example <code>$text["some_text"]</code>.</p>  <p>I've tried using preg_replace but not sure how I go about taking the found text between the brackets and use it in the replace value.</p>  <pre><code>$body = "This is a body of {{some_text}} text from a book."; $text["some_text"] = "really cool"; $parsedBody = preg_replace("\[{].*[}]/U", $text[""], $body); </code></pre>  <p>As you can see I'm trying to get the <code>some_text</code>text out of the string and use it to call an element from an array, this example is very basic as there <code>$body</code>value is vastly larger and <code>$text</code>has a couple hundred elements too it.</p>
