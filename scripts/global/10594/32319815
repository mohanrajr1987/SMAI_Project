<p>I have a pretty large database with some data listed in this format, mixed up with another bunch of words in the <em>keywords</em> column.</p>  <p><strong>BA 093</strong>, <strong>RJ 342</strong>, <strong>ES 324</strong>, etc.</p>  <p>The characters themselves always vary but the structure remains the same. I would like to change all of the strings that obey this character structure : <em>2 characters A-Z</em>, <em>space</em>, <em>3 characters 0-9</em> to the following:</p>  <p><strong>BA-093</strong>, <strong>RJ-342</strong>, <strong>ES-324</strong>, etc.</p>  <p>Be mindful that these strings are mixed up with a bunch of other strings, so I need to isolate them before replacing the empty space. Here is a sample string:</p>  <p><code>Km 111 aracoiaba Araçoiaba sp 270 spvias vias sao paulo  Araçoiaba Bidirecional</code></p>  <p><strong>sp 270</strong> is the bit we want to change. </p>  <p><em>EDIT: There was also an exception which should ignore the condition in case KM are the first two characters, it was handled by one of the answers</em></p>  <p>I have written the beginning of the script that picks up all the data and shows it on the browser to find a solution, but I'm unsure on what to do with my <em>if</em> statement to isolate the strings and replace them. And since I'm using explode it is probably turning the data above into two separate arrays each, which further complicates things.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  require 'includes/connect.php';  $pullkeywords = $db-&gt;query("SELECT keywords FROM main");  while ($result = $pullkeywords-&gt;fetch_object()) {      $separatekeywords = explode(" ", $result-&gt;keywords);     print_r ($separatekeywords);     echo "&lt;br /&gt;"; } </code></pre>  <p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>
