<p>I followed the line <a href="http://qnalist.com/questions/6142919/android-studio-1-3-rc3-ndk-debugging-help-break-points-not-getting-hit" rel="nofollow">here</a> to add "jniDebuggable {}" option to my build.gradle file and changed my run configuration to Android Native. I am using Android Studio, and I ensured the app runs on the phone before I attempt to debug. i also compiled my native code with "ndk-build ndk-debug=1". Before you ask why are you posting if the app works; the answer is I am running into problems with additional code that I like to have in the apk. The problem is when I add a break point in my native code, nothing happens on the phone. The debug console says: "Waiting for device". I added the break point right next to the JNIEXPORT ... statement. The only line that is in my native code is "(*env)->NewStringUTF(env,"Hello from JNI")". What should I do for my break point to work? </p>
