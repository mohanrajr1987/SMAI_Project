<p>How can I both <strong>include in the compilation</strong> and <strong>view in the project file tree</strong> some <code>.h</code> and <code>.cpp</code> files <strong>located outside of the project directory</strong> ?</p>  <p>With Visual Studio and a C++ project you would simply use "Add existing item", select your files and voil√†, it just works in ten seconds. Aren't Android-based development supposed to make developper's lives easier ? :/</p>  <p>I've been searching for hours how to do this now. None of the answers I found is addressing this.</p>  <p>I can't beleive that, among all the people who have been using Android Studio with the NDK, none of them have used C++ code outside of the <code>jni</code> folder...</p>  <p>Do you know how to do ? Thank you.</p>
