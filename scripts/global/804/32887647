<p>I am find the index a CGWindowID from the CFArrayRef. This is my code.</p>  <pre><code>CFArrayRef window2ids =CGWindowListCreate(kCGWindowListOptionOnScreenOnly ,kCGNullWindowID); jint windowid = 440; // I have selected this id from the CFArrayRef and trying to find the index CFRange range = {0, CFArrayGetCount(window2ids)}; const void *p; p = &amp;windowid; CFIndex index = CFArrayGetFirstIndexOfValue(window2ids, range, p); return index; </code></pre>  <p>But the above code is always returning <code>-1</code>. Which means the window id is not present in the CFArrayRef. How is that possible if I am selecting the window id from that array? How to solve my issue?</p>
