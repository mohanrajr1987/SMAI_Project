<p>As the title says.</p>  <p>Suppose the max heap size is 50MB , yet the device has 2GB of RAM, will Renderscript be able to use the 2GB or will it be constrained to the 50MB ?</p>  <p>If it will be constrained to the 50MB , is it possible to use the 2GB instead somehow?</p>  <p>If it won't be constrained to the 50MB , how do I use it this way? </p>  <p>And, does the "Allocation" usage actually allocate more memory, or is it more of binding of the data of the bitmap to be used on Renderscript ? </p>  <p>I'm asking this because sometimes you'd want to use a lot of memory to handle a task, even though the input and the output might be small in memory usage.</p>
