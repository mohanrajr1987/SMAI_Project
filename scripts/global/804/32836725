<p>I have one C++ application which communicates over Message Queues with other C++ applications.</p>  <p>I am trying to create one Java Application that reads/writes (communicates) queue being used by C++ application.</p>  <p>I have looked on JNI but i dont want to call C++ routines from Java application. I would only be interested in accessing data being read/write by C++ application Is there any possible way to do so?</p>
