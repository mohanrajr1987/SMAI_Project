<p>I try creating a peer for a Panel using WToolkit (windows only) createPanel, but it ends up with a NPT in the native function. Long story short I wish to create an AWT component and add it to a Win32 Application in JNI (roughly what a browser plugin achieves with an applet panel) So maybe someone knows how to do it, or could point to a source code for a browser plugin ? I failed so far finding one...</p>
