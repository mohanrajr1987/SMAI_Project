<p>I know there are similar questions about simple variables in C, but I guess this one is a bit different...</p>  <p>I have an int value named occurrences where I want to assign to it a value from a function like that:</p>  <pre><code>occurrences = GPOINTER_TO_INT(g_hash_table_lookup(Sip_income2, headersDigest[i])); </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that when i try to assign to this variable a value by using the hashtable_lookup function ,as I already showed above, then this value in java is equal to 0.</p>  <p>However, if I assign a value in a variable occurrence e.g </p>  <pre><code>occurrences = 5; </code></pre>  <p>and then i pass this variable as a parameter to a java function with JNI this value is indeed equal to 5 in java, so there is no problem with that. </p>  <p>What should the problem that causes all that and is there any possible solution?</p>
