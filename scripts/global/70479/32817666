<p>I am facing one very strange issue in bootstrap, basically I have this page <a href="http://excellencewebworks.com/bootstrap/video_skin.html" rel="nofollow">http://excellencewebworks.com/bootstrap/video_skin.html</a> </p>  <p>Here I am adding video covered with a tablet video skin. When I check the page under responsive mode in <code>Mozilla Firefox -&gt; Tools-&gt; Responsive Design View for 360 x 640 dimension</code> it works good under portrait and landscape mode.</p>  <p>But when checking the same page in physical device, it works only in portrait and not landscape, design gets altered in landscape mode. Strange to see this.</p>  <p>Can anyone please look into this and let me know what I am doing wrong here?</p>  <p>Thanks, Ronak Shah</p>
