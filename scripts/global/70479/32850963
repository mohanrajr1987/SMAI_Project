<p>I'm now designing Facebook Comments for my personal Wordpress. But I got stuck for the setting on mobile version of it.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tccLx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tccLx.png" alt="Desktop version of Facebook Comments"></a> <em>Desktop version of Facebook Comments</em> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vtrTa8F.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vtrTa8F.jpg" alt="Mobile version of Facebook Comments"></a> <em>Mobile version of Facebook Comments</em></p>  <p>According to the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments#settings" rel="nofollow">Docs of Facebook Developer</a>, the setting <code>mobile</code> is set to be <code>"auto-detect"</code> by default. Since the mobile Facebook Comments lacks good design, I'd like to make it the same as the desktop version. Then I set the attribute <code>mobile</code> to <code>false</code>, but this didn't work when I opened the site in mobile device. It's still the mobile ver of it. <a href="http://chenghuayang.com/blog/love-lorem-ipsum/#comments" rel="nofollow">A temp demo is here</a></p>  <p>So now, how to make Facebook Comments <em>always the desktop version</em>? </p>  <p>Also, how does it decide whether the device is mobile? I can also pretend the browser to be mobile in dev tools. Just pretty curious about this.</p>
