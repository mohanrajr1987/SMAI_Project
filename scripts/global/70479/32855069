<p>I am using dream weaver to create a responsive about me page for my site (using the default about me template). When I use the dream weaver on-device previewing system, the page is fully responsive and on my iPhone it resizes perfectly fine to look like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zyGfi.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zyGfi.jpg" alt="responsive preview"></a></p>  <p>However, when I upload the code to the website, the page no longer becomes responsive. It simply looks the same as it does on my laptop (as shown below) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z4Zi8.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z4Zi8.jpg" alt="nonresponsive preview"></a></p>  <p>Why is this issue occurring?</p>  <p>The html page is <a href="http://www.femtonation.com/AmroThabet.html" rel="nofollow" title="this">this</a>. If you need me to post the code here as well, please tell me. Your help is much appreciated :)</p>
