<p>I'm working with bootstrap 3, and I want to create a vertical navigation like this  <a href="http://www.gearcoop.com/" rel="nofollow">example</a>. I'm using this bootstrap <a href="http://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/examples/navmenu/" rel="nofollow">plugin</a> to create the vertical offcanvas navigation. I've been trying to modify the css to accomplish what I want, but I haven't been able to create the submenu that opens to the right, and to change the shape and size when you scroll down. Does anybody how to achieve this, or is there a plugin that can help me more.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Note: I will upload my example to Bootply when I get to my home, but basically is the same as the plugin I mention above.</p>
