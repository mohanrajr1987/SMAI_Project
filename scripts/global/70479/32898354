<p>My clients <a href="http://totalcom-1.com" rel="nofollow">website</a> works great on iPad &amp; desktop(of course) but my coding for iPhone 6's doesn't seem to be working. It's great until you see the white border on the right side of the screen. I'm not quite sure why it's there. I've checked to see if there are any divs or any boxes outside of the code that aren't accounted for but I can't seem to find any. Can anyone help me?</p>
