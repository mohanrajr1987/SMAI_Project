<p>So I've been trying to learn more about responsive design. I've started playing about on my computer with a tiny project with a mobile first approach. I scaled my browser down small and styled the layout correctly. Using % for widths and REM for fonts. I thought wow this is easy</p>  <p>However, when I went to look at my work on an actual mobile the layout positions were fine but every feature/element on the page was showing up tiny. So the navigation menu was coming up really small compared to how it looked in my browser.</p>  <p>Why is this? The browser I use is chrome and the mobile android.</p>
