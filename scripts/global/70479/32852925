<p>In the last months I got several orders from clients and they want to extend their desktop site with an external mobile version. When I order mobile visuals from web designers I usually get extremely big layouts (big for mobile view). For example the container is around 640px, and for example a button is around 300x100px.</p>  <p>My method is to use same sizes, but with ’em’ and ‘%’ and with media queries I finetune the final result while is check the changes on my phones.</p>  <p>How do you start the development with mobile websites?</p>
