<p>I am using the html5 picture tag to load the appropriate image:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;picture&gt;     &lt;source srcset="/path/to/image-450x450.jpg" media="(min-width:768px)"&gt;     &lt;source srcset="/path/to/image-600x600.jpg" media="(min-width:600px)"&gt;     &lt;source srcset="/path/to/image-450x450.jpg" media="(min-width:450px)"&gt;     &lt;img src="/path/to/image-224x224.jpg" alt="Alt text here"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; </code></pre>  <p>On my pc this loads up the first <code>source</code> image. On my tablet it is loading the second <code>source</code> image THEN the first <code>source</code> image.</p>  <p>I have plugged my tablet into my pc in developer mode so that I can inspect the elements and view the network tab from my pc.</p>  <p>That is how I learned that the tablet was loading the large images first, THEN the correct image.</p>  <p>I have read that browsers will apply the <code>source</code> of the first matching <code>media</code> attribute.</p>  <p>Frustratingly, I have <code>picture</code> elements on other pages and they are loading the images correctly, so why is this one doing it differently? How do I fix it?</p>  <p>I have changed the media query to different values but the browser seems to ignore it on first pass.</p>  <p>I have disabled javascript in case a plugin was to blame.</p>  <p>I thought maybe the browser was pre-fetching the 2nd image because the screen height was under 600px so I did an alert of <code>$(window).width()</code> and it is 800px so that isn't the answer either.</p>  <p>I am using Chrome 45.0.2454.94 on a Galaxy Tab 2 running android 4.2.2.</p>  <p>I can only assume other browsers/devices are having similar issues but I lack the ability to test on those devices. I am hoping if I fix the issue on this browser/device then it "should" be fixed on the other browsers/devices as well...</p>  <p>How do I get chrome on android to load the correct picture element?</p>  <p>[edit]</p>  <p>I have also implemented <a href="http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/" rel="nofollow">PictureFill</a> to see if that helped. It did not.</p>
