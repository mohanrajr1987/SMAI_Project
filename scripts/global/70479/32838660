I know and familiar about the grid system and making the skeleton in bootstrap, but main problem is setting the background image in the same. how to do that? </p>  <p>also this psd has a slider shown in header (you can see the image of boys &amp; girls standing side-by-side). In this slider is some rounded from bottom and flat from top how to make that kind of slider?.</p>  <p>I searched some sliders on google but all the result sliders are completely rectangular or square in shape? </p>  <p>Your Help is appreciated in advance. </p>
