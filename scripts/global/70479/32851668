<p>I need to show all products in a responsive div - three products in a row on lg resolutions, two products in a row on md and sm resolutions and one product in a row on xs resolution.</p>  <p>What should my view markup look like? The following code doesn't work, of course, because every product display in a new row. I found similar question on Stackoverflow with using of the each_slice(3), but there was only lg resolution support in this case, and I need responsive markup.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;% @products.each do |product| %&gt; &lt;div class="row"&gt;     &lt;div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-4"&gt;         &lt;%= link_to image_tag(product.productphoto.url), product_path(product) %&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
