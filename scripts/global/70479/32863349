<p>As far as I can tell, the <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes focus more on applying a suitably scaled image for the deviceâ€™s size and resolution.</p>  <p>There appears to be no facility to use these attributes to select an alternative image based on the screen size, such as one cropped or oriented differently.</p>  <p>Is this a correct understanding of the situation? Does that mean we will have to wait for the <code>picture</code> element to be widely supported for this task?</p>
