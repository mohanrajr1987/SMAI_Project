<p>I'm trying to get my site to display nicely on mobile devices. I have a header, fixed to the top, that is 70px height. I have a main menu as the footer, fixed to the bottom with 250px height.</p>  <p>The content in between is multiple pictures one after the other. I would like <strong>each</strong> picture to take up exactly the remaining height between the "header" and the "footer".</p>  <p>I need this to work on mobile devices in general, so I don't want to set the height of the image to a static height (ie: on a 320x480 device I could calculate the height to be 480-70-250 = 160px but I need it to also work on a device that's 360x640px).</p>
