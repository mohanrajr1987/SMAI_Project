<p>I created a named anchor on one page and linked to the anchor from another and it works as it should. My problem is on mobile browsers(everyone I've tried) when I navigate to the named anchor it throws it off center like it is not getting the responsive settings. Ideas?</p>  <p>Here is the page www.calliersmeats.com  if you use a mobile and click on one if the 3 pictures in a row you should see what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>First code is the named anchor page and the second code is the page linking to the anchor code.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;main&gt;      &lt;section class="well5"&gt;        &lt;div class="container"&gt;          &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="smbbq"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Smoked Meats and BBQ&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;main&gt;      &lt;section&gt;        &lt;div class="gallery"&gt;          &lt;div class="gallery_item1"&gt;            &lt;a href="gallery.html#smbbq"&gt; </code></pre>
