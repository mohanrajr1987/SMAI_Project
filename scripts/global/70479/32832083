<p>I have a really simple responsive layout, powered by <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" rel="nofollow">Skeleton</a>, but I just discovered a problem. The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> blocks used for displaying highlighted code seem to be defeating the responsiveness.</p>  <p>Here are some examples:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://sedimental.org/colophon.html" rel="nofollow">Working page</a>, mobile width work well</li> <li><a href="http://sedimental.org/remap.html" rel="nofollow">Non-working page</a>, mobile width means a lot of horizontal scrolling</li> </ul>  <p>I've tried to make the second page work like the first, but to no avail. I'm also interested in general layout debugging techniques that would help in this sort of situation.</p>
