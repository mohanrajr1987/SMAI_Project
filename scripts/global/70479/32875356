<p>Is there a way to use this famous sample dynamically?</p>  <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1iM5ZWJ" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1iM5ZWJ</a></p>  <p>What I'm looking for is to use this method in a way that doesn't require a static, defined height on the header. I would like to achieve a smooth scroll in a dynamic environment. </p>  <p>I'm a graphic designer, and amateur coder at best, so please keep high-brow conversation and jargon minimal, and ELI5</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
