<p>I want to create something like this screenshot:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wLnJf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wLnJf.png" alt="screenshot"></a></p>  <p>I tried using table display when the numbers and text are table-cell and the circle is absolute position, but it seems like I can't use ellipsis on table-cell.</p>  <p>My design is responsive so I can't use fixed width.</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/yefoz02z/1/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a></p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;     &lt;div class="cell cell1"&gt;         1     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="cell cell2"&gt;         very very long text that will need to be nowrap and with ellipsis very very long text that will need to be nowrap and with ellipsis         very very long text that will need to be nowrap and with ellipsis         very very long text that will need to be nowrap and with ellipsis     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="cell3"&gt;         absolute      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .wrapper{     display: table;     width: 100%; } .cell{     display: table-cell; } .cell1{     background: yellow; } .cell2{     background: lightblue; } </code></pre>
