<p>I am trying to fix a bug with a website where the header contains two elements, a div floated left and a <code>ul</code> floated right.</p>  <p>Normally, the two sit next to each other, but occasionally the content of the <code>ul</code> is large and as the two connect the div stays on the line but the <code>ul</code> drops to the next line. I want to prevent this by sacrificing width on the <code>div</code> and having the text on two lines.</p>  <p>The best I've been able to do so far is to set the width on the left <code>div</code> explicitly in px, but that makes everything two lines when it should only be when it needs to. Every other thing I've tried around display and min/max width hasn't had much affect.</p>  <p>I'll not post the full markup here but it goes a little something like this</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="minibasketAndLogin"&gt;     &lt;div id="login"&gt;&lt;!--omitted--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;ul class="basketLoginList"&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;!--there are 7 li's in this list--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The css is also rather convoluted so I won't include it here, but the whole thing can be found in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/dashood/f2tt50uj/" rel="nofollow">this fiddle</a>.</p>  <p>Basically, as the <code>ul</code> stretches, the <code>div</code> should shrink and it's text wrap to the next line.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
