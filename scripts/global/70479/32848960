<p>I am controlling the mobile menu I've created with Jquery. When it loads I need it to be hidden, revealing itself only when the user clicks on the 'header', activating the command I've created. I also need the menu to STAY open when the user scrolls down the page. The option outlined in this post almost works.</p>  <p>Right now when the page loads the menu is open. If I specify it to be closed using else $nav.hide();}, when I load it on my mobile device and try scrolling down the menu will close automatically. If I specify that it remain hidden upon loading with media queries, I have problems in the desktop layout (when i resize it, the menu links do not return to their original position, instead of being side by side they stack under each other-I am using inline-block as my display since it works better with my layout than floating the elements.)</p>  <p>If anyone has any ideas or can point me in the right direction, it'd be very much appreciated. Thank you.</p>  <p>JQUERY</p>  <pre><code>var screensize = document.documentElement.clientWidth;  $(function (){  var $window = $(window),     $nav = $('.link'),     $button = $('header');  $button.on('click', function (){     $nav.slideToggle(500); });    $window.on('resize', function (){     if ($window.width() &gt; 600)     { $nav.show();       }  }); });  </code></pre>
