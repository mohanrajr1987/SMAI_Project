<p>I am trying to group two buttons together.</p>  <p>I have a design that works on big screens, with two buttons floating to the right on the same line. However when resizing, there is one button that will get onto the text :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/B4mI8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/B4mI8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The requirements are :</p>  <ul> <li>the buttons are on the right of the text when the screen is big enough (works fine)</li> <li>the buttons get on top of each other (instead of next to each other like in the screenshot) when the screen gets smaller. They also should have the same width in this case.</li> </ul>
