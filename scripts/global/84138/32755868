The screenshot below shows a high resolution photo that - when outputted - becomes heavily pixelated. </p>  <p>I've tried the good ol' little known property specific to IE -<code>ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;</code> but it makes no difference.    </p>  <p>I've seen this problem in Microsoft's News App on multiple machines so i don't think its a problem limited to my machine or the way I'm displaying the image.</p>  <p>I've tried this in Windows 8/8.1 and 10 with the same results.</p>  <p>Trying the same code in Edge and IE11 works fine, the image is beautifully sharp without pixelation. Here is the exact CSS and image that make up the app example screenshot.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.exampleImage {     position: absolute;     top: 0;     left: 0;     right: 0;     bottom: 0;     margin: auto;     max-width: 100%;     max-height: 100%;     -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic; }</code></pre> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;img src="http://blog-admin.cddev.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Aston-Martin-DB10-Front-Three-Quarter-e1417707100993.jpg" class="exampleImage" /&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>Does anyone know how to stop the pixelation?</p>
