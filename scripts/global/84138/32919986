<p>I'm developing windows store app using javascript, html5 and C#. I have developed functionality which downloads zip from web and extracts it to "AppData" folder in "C" drive. That zip file has HTML files. So my question is, I want to display that html in windows app.<br><br> I'm able to load html from web in iframe but not from local drive. I also tried to do it by giving absolute path in iframe but not working.</p>
