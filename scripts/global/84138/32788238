<p>I have published an app in Windows store, but it's hidden for the moment, so I could test.</p>  <p>There is a Trial in the app, giving you access to some level. I didn't put any time limit. When you buy the game, you should have access to all the levels. But the "IsTrial" is always true.</p>  <pre><code>private static LicenseInformation _licenseInformation = CurrentApp.LicenseInformation;  public static bool IsLevelEnabled(LevelViewModel level) { #if DEBUG   return true; #else   if (_licenseInformation.IsActive)   {     if (_licenseInformation.IsTrial) //Problem, always true     {       if ([...])//some logic to check is level is enabled in Trial.       {         return true;       }       else       {         return false;       }     }     else //Should go here when you buy the app.     {       return true;     }   }   else   {     return false;   } #endif } </code></pre>  <p>My code is base on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/Dn532253(v=win.10).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/Dn532253(v=win.10).aspx</a>.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>Someone else bought my app on the store, don't think he tried the trial. Everything is fine for him. He had access to all levels. And I'm still stuck in trial.</p>
