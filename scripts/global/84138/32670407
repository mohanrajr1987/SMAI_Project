<p>I'm trying to read an audio stream using an <code>HttpClient</code> because I need to modify HTTP headers. The only "working" way I found is the following :</p>  <pre><code>HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync("http://...");           Stream stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(); IRandomAccessStream content = stream.AsRandomAccessStream(); musicPlayer.SetSource(content, "audio/mpeg");   //musicPlayer is a MediaElement object musicPlayer.Play(); </code></pre>  <p>The issue is that the <code>MediaElement</code> really starts to play when the file has been entirely downloaded, so it's quite useless for streaming. I need it to play as soon as the stream is received.</p>
