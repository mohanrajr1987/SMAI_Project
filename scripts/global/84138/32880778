<p>I am developing sample chat app for P2P using TCP. There is no server. Do I need streamSocketlistener class for other clients or it is for sever only? how other clients will receive request or data from other clients? How can I achieve this?</p>  <p>I am also getting problem while making connection. I have written the client code (sending data part) working ok. But getting problem in server code(or any client) i.e. while receiving data from particular IP.  I have written the steps as given in the provided link demo for server. But it is not working. Mainly from StreamSocketListener. Is there any simple sample code for server part ie how to listen,receive data and again sent back data.</p>  <p>This is my sample code of receiver class. My sender class is working.</p>  <p>Code is as below</p>  <p>Simple UI, I have texblock and button. On clicking button data is sent to hard coded IP along with hard coded message and vice versa after receiving message.</p>  <p>I am running the same code on two different machines(client) with necessary changes like IP Address etc.</p>  <p>Here is the code snippet,</p>  <pre><code> public sealed partial class MainPage : Page     {          public MainPage()         {             this.InitializeComponent();             textBlock.Text = new Receiver().getReceivedData();         }          private void button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)         {             new Sender().setSendData();             //textBlock.Text = new Receiver().getReceivedData();         }     }    class Sender     {         public void setSendData()         {             ConnectSocket();         }               private async void ConnectSocket()         {             HostName SenderHostName = new HostName("IP_Address"); // IP Address of client machine where we want to send data             StreamSocket socket = new StreamSocket();             await socket.ConnectAsync(SenderHostName, "12345");             DataWriter writer;             writer = new DataWriter(socket.OutputStream);             writer.WriteString("Hello guys, My first Chat in Windows-10 UWP");             await writer.StoreAsync();         }      }   class Receiver     {         HostName SenderHostName;         StreamSocketListener listener;         DataReader reader;         string receivedData = "";          public String getReceivedData()         {              ListenerSocket();                 return receivedData; // assign and display in textblock         }          private async void ListenerSocket()         {             // SenderHostName = new HostName("localhost"); // IP of on which listener implemented i.e. localhost             listener = new StreamSocketListener();             listener.Control.QualityOfService = SocketQualityOfService.Normal;            //  listener.ConnectionReceived += Listener_ConnectionReceived;             try             {                  // await listener.BindEndpointAsync (SenderHostName, "12345"); // use anyone of the two                 await listener.BindServiceNameAsync("12345");             }             catch(Exception e)             {              }              listener.ConnectionReceived += Listener_ConnectionReceived;          }          private async void Listener_ConnectionReceived(StreamSocketListener sender, StreamSocketListenerConnectionReceivedEventArgs args)         {             reader = new DataReader(args.Socket.InputStream);             reader.InputStreamOptions = InputStreamOptions.Partial;             try             {                 await reader.LoadAsync(reader.UnconsumedBufferLength);                 receivedData += reader.ReadString(reader.UnconsumedBufferLength);              }             catch (Exception e)             {              }         }            } </code></pre>  <p>Please help me.</p>
