<p>I want to publish windows app (it's windows store app) but I want to publish it inside my company. In this post:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6070676/enterprise-apps-for-non-enterprise-class-clients">Enterprise Apps for Non-enterprise Class Clients?</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I can see that I have two options: Ad hoc and enterprise.</p>  <p>The device I want to install it on is dell tablet.</p>  <p>One of the option I found (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2012/04/25/deploying-metro-style-apps-to-businesses.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2012/04/25/deploying-metro-style-apps-to-businesses.aspx</a>) is create certificate and app package.</p>  <p>The other option (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj206943(v=vs.105).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj206943(v=vs.105).aspx</a>), is register as a developer and create cert and token (AET).</p>  <p>I don't mind register but I want to be sure that it is the best way for me to deploy the apps.</p>  <p>What's the best option for me?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
