<p>I have created an Windows 8 store application for a small business using visual studios 2012, C# and xaml. The problem I am having is when I side load the application it requires a developer license every 30 days which the company is not happy with. The company do not want the application made available to the public hence my hesitation to put the application on windows store. So as side loading does not seem acceptable are there any suggestions on how to make an application private (only downloadable by people I choose) in windows store?</p>
