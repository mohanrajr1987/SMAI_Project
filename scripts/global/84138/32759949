<p>Since submitting a Windows Phone 8.1 app alongside our Windows Phone 8 I've noticed some strange behaviour in the store regarding app version numbers. In my AppManifest and when I'm building packages for the store I set a version number say, 2.0.2.1.</p>  <p>The package uploads fine but when visible in the store and on the upload page the version number has changed to when I built the package, for example v2015.918.xxxxx = 18/9/2015. I guess this is fine as it will keep getting larger but I still rather show the actual version number.</p>  <p>Thanks to an automated Twitter account I've noticed it happening to other apps too: <a href="https://twitter.com/NewsCuriosityWP/status/646956803079700480" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/NewsCuriosityWP/status/646956803079700480</a></p>  <p>I'd love to know why this happening, a bug with the store maybe?</p>  <p>Here are some examples:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HLfM7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HLfM7.png" alt="App upload page"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QVyIb.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QVyIb.jpg" alt="Store display"></a></p>
