<p>One of my apps ("Search All") for Windows 8/8.1/10 (initially published about 3 years back) is NOT showing up on the Windows 10 Store Desktop Application now. </p>  <p>Searching by name doesn't return the app in search results of Windows Store Desktop application. However, it is possible to install the app with a direct <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfj3sd" rel="nofollow">link</a>. It is as if my app is unlisted, but that should not be the case - it should be searchable &amp; public.</p>  <p>This has been the issue since July 27th, 2015. Since, then I've desperately tried everything, but nothing has worked:</p>  <ol> <li>made a new submission of app without changing anything; didn't work</li> <li>made a new submission of app with a new icon, a new package; didn't work</li> <li>ported app to windows 10 and made another submission; didn't work.</li> <li>also reached out to MS support, they just gave me this <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/07/24/changes-to-store-listings-and-search-algorithms/" rel="nofollow">link</a>, saying search algorithms were changed &amp; that could be the cause but they cannot do anything to fix the discoverability of the app.</li> </ol>  <p>Does anyone else have this issue? </p>  <p>I had none of these problems for 3 years, it all started when Microsoft launched Windows 10 publicly on July 27th :-( </p>
