<p>My use case, I have <strong>Windows 8.1 XAML app v1.0</strong> in appx package. I'd like to deploy this version on my tablet, use it for a while and then <strong>test update of this app to version 1.1</strong> which I have in another appx package.<br> Is this easily possible for tablet apps? I know that for Windows Phone there is Application Deployment Tool, but for Windows 8.1 there is nothing I know about.<br> Thanks</p>
