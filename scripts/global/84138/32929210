<p>I am trying to update my app in the windows store with a new version.  I am getting the error message in the UI:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This package is superseded by one or more higher-ranked packages.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The version number of the new binary is higher than the existing one. Here is what the version numbers look like in the store UI: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/phFgl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/phFgl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>How can I raise the rank of the new version so that the store accepts it?  What are the elements to package rank?  I searched online for this but could not find the answer. Thanks.</p>
