<p>I try this:</p>  <pre><code>PlayMusic = new MediaElement();             PlayMusic.AudioCategory = Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.AudioCategory.Media;              PlayMusic.Source = new Uri(@"C:\Users\UserName\Desktop\C:\Users\paulk\Desktop\Kill The Alarm - Begin Again.mp3");             PlayMusic.Play(); </code></pre>  <p>No more error messages appear on the display (try catch runs clean through).</p>  <p>Sorry for the short description... I can read and understand English very well but it is difficult for me to talk and write.</p>  <p>Thanks for all your help and answering!</p>
