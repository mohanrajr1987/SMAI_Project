<p>Trying to publish my UWP app. I'm able to build Release versions fine (I was actually able to push to the Store), but my app crashes as soon as it's launched. But the debug works fine?</p>  <p>I'm getting this error when debugging a Release build:</p>  <pre><code>Unhandled exception at 0x55BA32F9 (Windows.UI.Xaml.dll) in AppName.exe: 0xC000027B: An application-internal exception has occurred (parameters: 0x00A12450, 0x00000002). </code></pre>  <p>And these errors in Event Viewer if I launch it outside of VS:</p>  <p>1st:</p>  <pre><code>Activation of app AppName failed with error: The remote procedure call failed. See the Microsoft-Windows-TWinUI/Operational log for additional information. </code></pre>  <p>2nd:</p>  <pre><code>Faulting application name: AppName.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x560c53bd Faulting module name: Windows.UI.Xaml.dll, version: 10.0.10240.16431, time stamp: 0x55c9b90a Exception code: 0xc000027b Fault offset: 0x007132f9 Faulting process id: 0x1e38 Faulting application start time: 0x01d0fbcba39fec70 Faulting application path: C:\Development\AppName\AppName\bin\x86\Release\AppX\AppName.exe Faulting module path: C:\Windows\System32\Windows.UI.Xaml.dll Report Id: 5c74b39d-98e4-4e89-b2ec-c81cbd5383d1 Faulting package full name: AppName Faulting package-relative application ID: App </code></pre>  <p>Is there something I'm doing wrong? I don't get any errors or warnings on Debug.</p>
