<p>I am working on mobile apps that only interface with a cloud-based database. The access to this database requires a pre-defined account. Although the app is available for free download, it is useless for anyone without such an account. It is meant as a mobile extension for customers who have purchased the desktop application.</p>  <p>Could such an app be approved? </p>  <p>Any guidance is appreciated.</p>
