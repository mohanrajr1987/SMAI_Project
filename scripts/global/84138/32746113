<p>In a Windows 8.1 store app if you access a bluetooth device via FromIdAsync it prompts you to allow/block access to that device by your app.  If you accidentally hit block I can not find a way to enable access by this device again.  Is there anyway to force that prompt up again through the app?</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.bluetooth.rfcomm.rfcommdeviceservice.fromidasync.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.bluetooth.rfcomm.rfcommdeviceservice.fromidasync.aspx</a></p>
