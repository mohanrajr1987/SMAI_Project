<p>I custom ItemContainerStyle and put an Image in that style which is for selection mark,and change pointerOver state to show the image, it works fine when I run my App, but if I minimized my App for about 5 minutes or longer, it does not work any more, I mean when my pointer over a GridViewItem, the selection mark(that image) does not showup.  UWP( universal windows platform) .windows 10 build 10547. VS2015</p>
