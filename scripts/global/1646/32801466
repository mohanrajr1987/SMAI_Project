<p>I have jQuery niceScroll setup, its working fine on the body, however I want to have different themed scrollbars on the same page. I have the following code: </p>  <p>Here is my fiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/JPA4R/135/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/JPA4R/135/</a></p>  <pre><code> &lt;script&gt;   $(document).ready(function () {     $("body").niceScroll({cursorcolor:"#267ec8", cursorwidth:"10px"});     $("#test").niceScroll({cursorcolor:"#ffffff", cursorwidth:"5px"});   });  &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Link to plugin: <a href="http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/" rel="nofollow">http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/</a></p>  <p>Body i want to have a blue scrollbar and on the other div i have i want the scrollbar to be white and thinner. However with the code above the one on the body is working but not the one on the div?</p>  <p>Is it possible to have multiple on the same page? Any help would be great, i am stuck and cannot see anything wrong with the above. Possible CSS issue or plugin i cant figure it out.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
