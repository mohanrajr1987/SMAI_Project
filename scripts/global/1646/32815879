<p>I'm building a Web Application in which I have multiple scrollbar, but I want to manage it into one. </p>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-mVch5dDBkOQThXcGV0LVN6LWs/view?usp=drivesdk" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-mVch5dDBkOQThXcGV0LVN6LWs/view?usp=drivesdk</a></p>  <p>Do you know some library or a way to handle this? </p>  <p>One example of this behavior is: when you create a Page on Wordpress, in the past there was 2 scrolls, one for the Editor and other for the page. But now, both are manage by only one Scroll. </p>
