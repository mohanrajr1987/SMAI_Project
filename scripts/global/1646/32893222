<p>I would like to pause a section and continue scrolling the inner div content until the end of content and then continue to scroll to the next section.</p>  <p>Something similar to the second section of squarespace. <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squarespace.com/</a></p>  <p>Would appreciate if anyone can tell me how to go about making this possible. Thanks!</p>
