<p>Using Winforms and vb.net VS 2012:</p>  <p>If I have a large scrollable panel and I put a bunch of smaller panels inside the larger one. When I scroll the larger panel up or down, some of the smaller panels will scroll out of view. My question is, can I put a listener on the smaller panels so that the smaller panel knows when it has scrolled out of view?</p>  <p>I can't use the .visible property because that is always set to true even when the panel is not in the window. I also know I can set the .focus property to bring it back into view, but it can still lose focus when in the viewable window as soon as something else takes focus.</p>  <p>So is there a property or something that I can listen for that detects when the panel has scrolled out of view? And if not, is there something else I can do to detect this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
