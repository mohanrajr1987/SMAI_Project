<p>Im am using <a href="http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/" rel="nofollow">this full page scroll</a>, and really like it. However, i would like to use a custom effect in the middle, between two slides (a fade between those two). I want to fade between two different images during the automatic scroll, without needing the user to scroll themselves.</p>  <p>How would I best add this?</p>
