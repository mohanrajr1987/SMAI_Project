<p>I have a <code>Panel</code> with <code>AutoScroll=true</code>. I'd like to manually scroll the panel's <code>VerticalScroll</code>. I've tried both setting <code>VerticalScroll.Value</code> and <code>Panel.ScrollControlIntoView(...)</code>.</p>  <p>However, both cases yielded the following result: The scrollbar does appear to have scrolled to the value but the panel's contents remain unmoved. Scrolling upwards shows an empty panel.</p>  <p>I'm trying to do this during startup. If I scroll directly to the control after a delay (from a thread), it works (though setting the scrollbar value doesn't).</p>  <p>Is there a better (synchronous) way of achieving what I'm looking for?</p>
