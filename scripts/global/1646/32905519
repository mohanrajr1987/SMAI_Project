<p>I have the following element:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oqyiI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oqyiI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Where the "1 comment" button container is positioned absolute to the main container which is relative positioned. There problem is when I resize it and scroll down, the "1 comment" button container is going up few px. I want it to keep it in the bottom. Like a sticky footer positioned fixed to the main container. I wouldn't want to use javascript for this.</p>  <p>You can see the code live, <a href="http://www.florin-pop.com/work/Marcus%20App/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BWOHZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BWOHZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
