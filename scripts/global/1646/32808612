<p>There are no scroll arrows in my current Mint 17.2 setup. I'm using this system on a laptop and it's hard to go without these, especially when reading documents or browsing webpages that are longer than a few pages. I've tried switching the desktop theme from Cinnamon to MATE to Mint XP but that didn't help. Does anybody have a solution?</p>  <p>If you're not sure what I mean by scroll arrows, see this:<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC79322.gif" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC79322.gif</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
