<p>I have a bit of a tricky background scrolling issue.  I am trying to set a background image to do the following:</p>  <ol> <li>fill the width of the page</li> <li>the image ratio will scale accordingly, so the image does not skew</li> <li>the background will scroll until it reaches the end of the length of the background image</li> <li>once the image has scrolled to the bottom, the background will become fixed</li> </ol>  <p>I cannot seem to find anywhere where this effect is being used online.  thanks!</p>
