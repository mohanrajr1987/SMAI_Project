<p>I do not remember the first time I saw this bug. If it started with the iOS 9 framework or not.</p>  <p>The problem is when I have an UITableView as first child of my UIViewController in Storyboard the tableView apparently have a bigger content size and do not show the scroll indicators. When I put a transparent UIView as first child, the problem disappear.</p>  <p>The same issue occurs with UITableViewControllers. And there is no trick because de TableView is the main View of the ViewController.</p>  <p>Anyone got this bug too or know how to fix it?</p>  <p>I am trying to resolve this problem in order to prevent future problems just because the Storyboard is in "MacGyver mode".</p>
