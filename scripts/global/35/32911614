<p>I understand the basic about these two concepts, but I have some question for which I can't find answers on MSDN or in other related documentations.</p>  <p>I know that a user mode socket (WSA) creation call ends up being a CreateFile call. Is there a point somewhere in the kernel where this gets "mapped" to a Kernel Socket? Or are these two concepts completely unrelated? </p>  <p>That question is maybe more out of curiosity, not that the second isn't.</p>  <p>Why would someone choose to implement a server/client in Kernel space? If something can be done in user space why do it in kernel? Are there any real-life situation where a Kernel implementation of a client/server is a must? </p>
