<p>i'm in a bit confusion out there, i obviously know that P2P (peer-2-peer) is used for file sharing. and i have heard that Skype application is using P2P for its communication, i mean like if a host want to do a video chat it goes through P2P protocol in Skype app, i obviously am not sure about that, but i heard of it in YouTube and some website around the web. so my question is that would P2P make a client inside a private network access another network client being private either.  to be precise, i want a host from a private network access a files from another private network's host. like myself access a file from my neighbors network files. am i going to be able to use P2P there? hope that do not make any confusion.
