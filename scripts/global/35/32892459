<p>I have made a small client program which will receive a message from server. I want to disconnect the client from the server safely after receiving the message.(Another case may also arise such that, I want to compare the received value with another value and if the don't match, the client will be disconnected) My sample code is:</p>  <pre><code>using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Net; using System.Net.Sockets; using System.IO; using System.Text; class Program {      static void Main(string[] args)     {         try         {                             TcpClient tcpClient = new TcpClient("127.0.0.1", 1234);              NetworkStream ns = tcpClient.GetStream();             StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(ns);             StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(ns);             string data;              //receiving message             data = sr.ReadLine();             Console.WriteLine(data);              //I want to disconnect here               }         catch (Exception e)         {             Console.Write(e.Message);         }          Console.Read();     } } </code></pre>  <p>What additional things will I need to add?</p>
