<p>I have user <code>http.request</code> for making connection to another server in nodejs. Unfortunately that server has a delay in responding in some situations. So I want to close the request after some period. I have found following code but this close connection if target server was not reachable or connection has not been established.</p>  <pre><code>req.on('socket', function (socket) {     socket.setTimeout(myTimeout);       socket.on('timeout', function() {         req.abort();     }); }); </code></pre>  <p>What I want is closing connection after for example 2 seconds wether data is coming or not.</p>  <p>Does anyone has any idea?</p>
