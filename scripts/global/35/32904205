<p>I'm doing my first steps with dbus (using the glib C API) and have already my problems with the GLib. The Lib is serving the dbus data in the main loop</p>  <pre><code>g_main_loop_run(loop); </code></pre>  <p>For my application I do need a second socket acting as a TCP-IP server. How can I use both sockets if they are blocking? The application is running on an embedded hardware (linux) and has only very limited resources, so unfortunately multithreading is not an option.</p>
