<p>Would it be possible to manually set or at least influence the path that a packet takes through the internet using socket programming for an application?</p>  <p>For e.g. suppose I don't want the program to send packets that go through routers based in country A, but to go around it instead. </p>  <p>Would that be possible? I am using C++ so advice in that context would be great but any language would be helpful as well. </p>
