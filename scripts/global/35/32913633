<p>I have been trying to port some old linux code to a mac. Unfortunately, when I compile the code using g++ 5 I run into a ton of errors all along the lines of</p>  <p>'PF_PACKET' was not declared in this scope 'ETH_P_ALL' was not declared in this scope 'SIOCGIFINDEX' was not declared in this scope 'struct ifreq' has no member named 'ifr_ifindex' ... The list goes on for quite a while</p>  <p>I know that all of these errors are because I don't have the following header files on a mac. </p>  <p>1.) netpacket/packet.h</p>  <p>2.) linux/wireless.h</p>  <p>How can I get these on my mac in order to compile my code. </p>
