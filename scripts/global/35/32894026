<p>RIO here stands for the Windows 8 'Registered I/O' Networking extensions. From looking at example code, it seems that regardless of whether you are using RIONotify with events or IO Completion Ports, you basically end up writing the same loop, and would have nearly identical performance characteristics. The loop body is:</p>  <pre><code>RIONotify() [event or IOCP] Wait [on the event, or using GetQueuedCompletionStatus()] RIODequeueCompletion() // Process the dequeued events </code></pre>  <p>Basically it seems like the usage of IO Completion Port is providing no additional functionality over 'event' notify/waiting, since the actual queue of messages is done with RIODequeueCompletion. So it doesn't matter whether you use events, or IOCP. My question is, am I overlooking any interesting or important difference between the models?</p>
