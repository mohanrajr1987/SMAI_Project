<p>do you recommend the Mono for high performance Unix-based TCP socket server with thousands of concurrent connections? </p>  <p>We are investigating the Mono platform for our Unix-based master server (TCP socket server) which should be able to handle at least ~1000-5000 persistent connections. It must run on Unix platform because our tech infrastucture is already built on this ecosystem and ready to use. Another big benefit is that our game client is build in Unity, so using the same technology for client and server looks very prospective for us. </p>  <p>I already found and tried <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/83102/C-SocketAsyncEventArgs-High-Performance-Socket-Cod" rel="nofollow">high performance implementation using SocketAsyncEventArgs</a> on Ubuntu and the results are pretty cool. It was able to process ~4000 messages per second with 1000 opened connections. There is also <a href="https://github.com/kerryjiang/SuperSocket" rel="nofollow">SocketServer framework</a> which looks quiet interesting. </p>  <p>However, I am little bit sceptical about other possible drawbacks:</p>  <ol> <li>Not sure if the Mono implementation of the SocketAsyncEventArgs is fully replacable to .NET implementation on Windows. Is it ready for production in the current state? </li> <li>Not sure if this is still issue with last versions but I found many hate comments targeting Mono performance. Is Mono comparable to other high-level languages like Java/C++/.NET in the question of performance? </li> <li>You know it looks like there is not many people which are going this server way with Mono. Also we want to focus primarily on business logic rather then polish and hack core server functionality. So, is it possible to rapidly prototype relatively stable framework around Mono or we will need to solve many hidden secrets and issues? </li> <li>Looks like the future of Mono is in crossplatform mobile market not servers. (we are looking forward to next few years) </li> <li>There is also competition which have also its pros and cons (e.g. Java(Netty), Node.js) and is better in some aspects. </li> </ol>
