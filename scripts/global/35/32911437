<p>We just testing a link which has 100 Mb/s bandwidth and 70ms latency between the two site. With plain iperf increasing tcp window size we managed to achieve close to 100 Mbit/s throughput but over SQL server client we can achive only 3 Mbit/s due to small tcp window.  Did the same test with NFS copy without any change on tcp window (which you cannot change on windows 2012 ) we achive only 4-5 Mbit/s there as well.</p>  <p>Is there any way to configure this in .Net and increase the default tcp window size used by the sql connection on windows server 2012?</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated to solve this issue.</p>
