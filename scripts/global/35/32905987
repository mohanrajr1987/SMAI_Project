<p>I read about <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/wifi-direct.html" rel="nofollow">P2P connections with wifi</a> on the official android tutorial. It allows me to connect devices who are in close proximity. The problem is that </p>  <ol> <li>I want to be able to decide which device becomes the <em>group owner</em></li> <li>I don't want to use the device name as an ID for each peer in the network. I would like the group owner to setup a <em>channel name</em> which can be recognized by others. Each peer can connect to the channel name and choose a name (not their device name).</li> </ol>  <p>Maybe the standard direct wifi implementation as put forth in the tutorial isn't the exact tool I'm looking for. Maybe a third party library could help?</p>
