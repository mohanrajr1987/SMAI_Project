<p>I have been building an application for a few months now, and it seems to be able to connect to its server, but only as long as I use my private IP address.  As soon as I change the address to my public IP, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>java.net.ConnectException: failed to connect to /108.29.314.30 (port 8001): connect failed: ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused) </code></pre>  <p>This is the socket on the application (which, again, works only with my private IP)</p>  <pre><code>clientSocket = new Socket("108.29.314.30", 8001); </code></pre>  <p>This is connection loop of the server:</p>  <pre><code>ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(8001);      while(serverIsRunning) {          Socket connectionSocket = socket.accept();         Thread connection = new Thread(new ServerConnection(connectionSocket));         connection.start();     } </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone tell my why this is not working?  Any help is appreciated.</p>
