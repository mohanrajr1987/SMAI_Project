<p>I've installed Redmine, it's working fine as long as I use the development server. Now I'm trying to configure it to run under apache, using fastcgi. The following message is being showed:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/local/share/gems/gems/fcgi-0.9.2.1/lib/fcgi.rb:54:in `for_fd': not a socket file descriptor (ArgumentError)         from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fcgi-0.9.2.1/lib/fcgi.rb:54:in `default_connection'         from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fcgi-0.9.2.1/lib/fcgi.rb:40:in `each'         from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/rack-1.4.7/lib/rack/handler/fastcgi.rb:27:in `run'         from ./dispatch.fcgi:20:in `&lt;main&gt;' </code></pre>  <p>Looks like the problem is something related to sockets in ruby, to make it easy, I've isolated the problem:</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby require 'socket' s=Socket.for_fd(STDIN.fileno) </code></pre>  <p>When I try to run the code above, the same message is being showed:</p>  <pre><code>/tmp/test.rb:5:in `for_fd': not a socket file descriptor (ArgumentError) </code></pre>  <p>Since I'm not a ruby programmer, I would like to understand, what is happening?</p>
