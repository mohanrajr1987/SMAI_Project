<p>I need to transfer large file over tcp/ip locally via sockets. I need best possible performance. What is the optimal simulations connections count and why?  (I mean that I can use 1, 2, 3, ... sockets to send the same file parts in parallel).</p>  <p>I think that the best performance I will get with 1 simulations connection because IO performance is not parallelized well, there is not much processor involved.  And usually you will even got performance degradation if you, for example, will write file from several thread via one.  But tests results says that this is not always true for network transfer.</p>
