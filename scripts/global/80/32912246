<p>Is there a way to make physical F5 BigIP LB to route traffic to both EC2 instances(Autoscaling) and physical machines? I came across this article <a href="https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/using-big-ip-gtm-to-integrate-with-amazon-web-services" rel="nofollow">https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/using-big-ip-gtm-to-integrate-with-amazon-web-services</a> but it seems it is routing traffic to an entire AWS zone, not to a couple of EC2 instances behind a ELB.</p>
