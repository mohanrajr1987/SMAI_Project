<p>I successfully installed tile server based on the instruction given in the switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-14-04/. Also I set up apache web-server and took slippymap.html from github.com/openstreetmap/mod_tile/blob/master/slippymap.html. But when I open slippymap in browser I got error tiles but almost all of them have request status 200 (load correctly). And size of every tile is 0 kb. But if I open tile in new tab it displayed correctly.</p>  <p>I don't know why it happens and how to fix it.</p>
