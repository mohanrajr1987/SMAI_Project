<p>I've looked everywhere to find the proper solution/method but I can't seem to find anything that <strong>works for me.</strong> I even asked friends and they helped but none prevailed.</p>  <p>What i'm trying to do is, changing the URL displayed in the browser but only that. (No rediraction, page re-loading). I want to do this to make my UCP just cleaner looking when going through certain pages/files.</p>  <p><strong>What am I trying to achieve?</strong> Heres an example on a profile, the URL would be:</p>  <pre><code>mysite.com/ucp/profile.php?player=Heartfire </code></pre>  <p>However, I want it to look like</p>  <pre><code>mysite.com/ucp/profile/heartfire </code></pre>  <p>Or something else! I just want to get rid of the parameters AFTER the .PHP</p>  <p>I've tried various examples found with google and this website but none seems to work, could somebody please guide me along the way to achieve the result.</p>  <p><strong>what have I tried so far?</strong> Here are a few examples of what I tried before:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^profile/([0-9]+)/?$    /ucp/profile.php?player=$1 RewriteRule profile.php?player=$1 profile.php [NC,L] RewriteRule ^profile$ profile.php?player=$1 </code></pre>  <p>So what am I doing wrong that it isn't working?</p>
