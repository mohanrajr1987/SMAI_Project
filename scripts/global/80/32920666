<p>Was trying to sort it out by myself but no luck.</p>  <p>I have a website (PHP, Apache),  with the following structure, as a sample:</p>  <pre><code>1. http://hostname/  2. http://hostname/category?list=listname  3. http://hostname/product?id=...&amp;name=productname  4. http://hostname/recipes  5. http://hostname/recipe?id=...&amp;name=recipename  + many others. </code></pre>  <p>Current .htaccess is:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.php -f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.php  </code></pre>  <p>So for examples <a href="http://hostname/category?list=" rel="nofollow">http://hostname/category?list=</a>...  becomes /category.php?list... And then it catches php script and works.</p>  <p>I want to make friendly URLs like these:</p>  <pre><code>1. http://hostname/  2. http://hostname/category/listname/ 3. http://hostname/product/productname/ 4. http://hostname/recipes/ 5. http://hostname/recipe/recipename/ </code></pre>  <p>And on the other hand previous urls must still work as webiste is hugely indexed by search enginges.  So from oldstyle urls it must 301 redirect to new urls. Any ideas? All my efforts had errors. I even tried to make PHP routing via index.php entry point,  but i cant get how to deal with oldstyle links.</p>
