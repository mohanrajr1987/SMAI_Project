<p>If you log in to Apache Jira and using the advanced search option, put </p>  <pre><code>issuetype = Bug AND status = Closed AND resolution = Fixed AND assignee !=unassigned AND (summary~ "\"large number\"" OR description~ "\"large number\"")  </code></pre>  <p>in there, you will see there are total of 174 bug reports. When I try to export them as excel file, only 100 results was saved in the bug report. Looks like there is some kind of limit. How can I download all the bug report to a EXCEL FILE????</p>
