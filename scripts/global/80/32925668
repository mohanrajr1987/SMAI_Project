<p>I am trying to get a mod rewrite script to work, but for some reason I cannot seem to get things functioning properly.  I know that mod_rewrite is working, because if I run the following test it redirects correctly:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^oranges.html$ apples.html </code></pre>  <p>However, if I try and push all queries to an index file or something to process using php then it does not work:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule .? index.php [L] </code></pre>  <p>What I am trying to achieve is to have a database table with two columns, one with an ID and the other with a rewrite URL.  So what I mean by this is:</p>  <pre><code>ID | URL 16 | nice-url-1 17 | nice-url-2 </code></pre>  <p>So the actual URL is /index.php?id=16, but I want there to be a table lookup and there to be a redirect to /nice-url-1.  Now I would have thought I would go with the second rewrite conditions, but the problem is it just does not redirect.</p>  <p>I am running Centos 6 with Apache 2.2.15, so I am wondering if {REQUEST_FILENAME} is just not supported.  I did try adding DOCUMENT_ROOT, but that made absolutely no difference.</p>  <p>Any help most appreciated.</p>
