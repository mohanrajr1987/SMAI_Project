<p>I am setting up a new server to upload my website (which is working perfectly on my localhost) and I keep getting permission denied errors when I try to log some activities. I can use fopen to read but not to write.</p>  <p>I've given it 777 permissions just to test it, and it still isnt working. I also checked, safe_mode, open_basedir and any other restriction that I thought might be there on the server. It also is not the path of the file either. </p>  <p>Anyone has any ideas?</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
