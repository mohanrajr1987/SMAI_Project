<p>Trying to use htaccess to allow access to a url by one ip address only. There are a couple stackoverflow posts on the subject that I followed to no avail.</p>  <pre><code> RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^123\.45\.45\.6  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} http://sub.domain.com/thatThing [NC]  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://sub.domain.com [R=307,L] </code></pre>  <p>So my understanding of this is: 1. If the request does not come from this IP address 2. If the requested URL is <a href="http://sub.domain.com/thatthing" rel="nofollow">http://sub.domain.com/thatthing</a> 3. Redirect to the home page</p>  <p>When I test this, the page <code>http://sub.domain.com/thatthing</code> is available from any IP. I even tried proxy's to be sure. Is there some syntax thing I'm missing?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
