<p>We have a collection of boxes for our testing purpose. Clients get connected to our boxes using their tools to test our's and theirs app. Recently we installed trusted signed certs on our boxes and things have broken related to connectivity. We are not sure how to fix the issue.</p>  <p>Below is my Apache config:</p>  <pre><code>Listen *:8000 &lt;VirtualHost stage.xx.xx.com:8000&gt; ServerName stage.xx.xx.com  SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /x/httpd/ssl/stage_xx_xx_com.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /x/httpd/ssl/stage.xx.xx.com.key  SSLProxyEngine on     ProxyPass        "/" "https://stage.xx.xx.com:8080"     ProxyPassReverse "/" "https://stage.xx.xx.com:8080"  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have copied the .crt and .key file in path /x/httpd/ssl/ as per name specified above</p>  <p>Below is the issue we are receiving when we connect from our client box:</p>  <pre><code>test@abc-yy-yyy-yyyyy:~$ openssl s_client -connect stage.xx.xx.com:8000 -showcerts       CONNECTED(00000003) depth=0 C = US, ST = Arizona, L = Phoenix, O = "DataMart, Inc.", OU = Development Support, CN = stage.xx.xx.com verify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate verify return:1 depth=0 C = US, Arizona, L = Phoenix, O = "DataMart, Inc.", OU = Development Support, CN = stage.xx.xx.com verify error:num=27:certificate not trusted verify return:1 depth=0 C = US, ST = Arizona, L = Phoenix, O = "DataMart, Inc.", OU = Development Support, CN = stage.xx.xx.com verify error:num=21:unable to verify the first certificate verify return:1 --- Certificate chain 0 s:/C=US/ST=Arizona/L=Phoenix/O=DataMart, Inc./OU=Development Support/CN=stage.xx.xx.com    i:/C=US/O=DigiCert Inc/OU=www.digicert.com/CN=DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ............................. -----END CERTIFICATE----- --- Server certificate subject=/C=US/ST=Arizona/L=Phoenix/O=DataMart, Inc./OU=Development Support/CN=stage.xx.xx.com issuer=/C=US/O=DigiCert Inc/OU=www.digicert.com/CN=DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA --- No client certificate CA names sent --- SSL handshake has read 2066 bytes and written 423 bytes --- New, TLSv1/SSLv3, Cipher is DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA Server public key is 2048 bit Secure Renegotiation IS supported Compression: NONE Expansion: NONE SSL-Session:     Protocol  : TLSv1     Cipher    : DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA     Session-ID:     Session-ID-ctx:     Master-Key: DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD     Key-Arg   : None     PSK identity: None     PSK identity hint: None     SRP username: None     Start Time: 1443694749     Timeout   : 300 (sec)     Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate) --- QUIT DONE </code></pre>  <p>I tried many ways to resolve this - but the error 27 and 21 does not goes away - is it that my certs are invalid or I am missing some setup issue - do we need to setup something in client box also - if yes then what and how?</p>
