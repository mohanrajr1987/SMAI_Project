<p><strong>main.c</strong></p>  <pre><code>List L; Initialize(&amp;L); printf("%d\n", Size(&amp;L)); </code></pre>  <p><strong>list.c</strong></p>  <pre><code>void Initialize (List *L) {     L = malloc(sizeof(List));     if (L == NULL) {         perror("Unable to create memory for list. Exiting.");         exit(1);     }     L-&gt;size = 0; }  int Size (List *L) {     return L-&gt;size; } </code></pre>  <p>What I want outputted would be a size of '0', however what I am getting is the max int sizeof '2673724'.  I am kind of confused at this point what is wrong with my code. Looking with gdb it looks like the Initialize() function is not actually modifying the List's size as it remains the same before and after entering the function.</p>  <p>Did I do something wrong?</p>
