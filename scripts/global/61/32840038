<p>I am using <code>Rserve</code> to access R scripts from within my Java code. Everything is working perfect throughout the code where I pass variables to Rscripts and get the results back. However, almost at the end of the code, where I am accessing a R script, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>WARNING: discarding buffer because too big (awaiting 44617265235 bytes) </code></pre>  <p>and the execution halts with this error:</p>  <pre><code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException:   org.rosuda.REngine.Rserve.RserveException: eval failed, request status: invalid parameter Caused by: org.rosuda.REngine.Rserve.RserveException: eval failed, request status: invalid parameter </code></pre>  <p>I am not sure why and from where this error is generated and how to solve this? I found one solution on the web: <a href="https://github.com/cscheid/rserve-js/issues/7" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cscheid/rserve-js/issues/7</a> but it did not prove very helpful. I also tried using <code>connection.close()</code> everytime after I access my R script but it did not work as well. Can someone help?</p>
