<p>I am thinking about a way that using <code>np.tile</code> but without allocating memory for a new matrix. Is there possibly a way to achieve this?</p>  <p>Being a bit verbose, the functions I am seeking is as follow:</p>  <pre><code>a = np.random.rand(4,) b = np.random.rand(8,) c = np.tile(a,2) + b # this generate a memory copy anyhow </code></pre>  <p>I want to avoid the memory copy of the <code>np.tile</code>.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
