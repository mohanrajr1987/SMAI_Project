<p>Hello I'm pretty new to coding and have started with my first bigger project just to learn faster.<br> When I trying too allocate memory the error "this declaration has no storage class or type specifier" in the tool tip and then it wont compile.</p>  <pre><code>#ifndef MAP_H #define MAP_H #include "Headers.h" #include "Player.h"  class Player; class Map { public:     Map();     Player *player;      player = new Player;      std::vector &lt;std::string&gt; levelData;      void Draw();     void Create();     void Open();     void Save(); };  #endif </code></pre>
