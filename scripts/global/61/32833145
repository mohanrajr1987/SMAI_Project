So I searched for more information here, but couldn't get SQLite specific info.</p>  <ol> <li><p>What advantages does ':memory:' mode have? (When do I need this?)</p></li> <li><p>In-memory database's performance is faster?</p></li> <li><p>Do I still need to use transactions on an In-memory database?</p></li> </ol>
