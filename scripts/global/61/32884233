<p>im drawing a chart on wpf 4.5  using visifire 5.1.3.0,  i use several collections with thousands of points so it reaches 800MB memory when  the chart is painted. </p>  <p>The problem is when i close the wpf window where i  paint the chart the memory doesnt get released, i tried with.</p>  <p>MyChartGrid.Children.Clear();</p>  <p>In the window_closing event, i also cleared all the collections im using, i also call manually the GC... but theres always some memory used remaining that i cant release... </p>  <p>It happens something like this:</p>  <p>1st execution:  800MB after chart painted                         300MB after releasing resources</p>  <p>2nd execution: 1000MB after chart painted                          600MB after releasing resources</p>  <p>3rd execution: memory crash</p>  <p>IMPORTANT: this doesnt happen if I dont draw the chart and i just fill the collections.</p>
