<p>I have installed the monitoring agent in my instance group disk. I need to autoscale instances based on memory usage, however when I am going to configure the target metric in GCE web console I miss the memory usage metric identifier. Which is the missing identifier or how can I autoscale my group based on memory usage?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k9e1d.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/k9e1d.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
