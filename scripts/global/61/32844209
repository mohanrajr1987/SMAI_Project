<p>In nutshell, as I understand memory management, processor produces virtual addresses. These addresses are translated to corresponding physical addresses using per-process address table by MMU (with TLBs and page-faults in-between, as and when needed).</p>  <p>My question is does processor always produces Virtual addresses? In terms of Address-spaces(user/kernel), Processor modes (user/kernel) and contexts (process/system) when all times does processor produce physical addresses?</p>
