<p>I'm trying to install 48 GB with six 8GB Dimms without success. The moduls itself work properly. Tested them pairwise. Put 6 Dimms into the "A"-Slots, 1A,2A,3A -> System starts with 32GB. Moduls are Samsung M393B1K70CH0-CH9Q5 M, 2Rx4 PC3-10600R-09-10-E1-P1 I think they should work. BIOS is latest. Something I should consider? Any help appreciated.</p>  <p>Best Regards ulus</p>
