<p>I am performing statistics on 2 rather large (2+ GB each) 3D arrays and I perform that computation inside a function:</p>  <pre><code>double stats(vector&lt; vector&lt; vector&lt; double &gt; &gt; &gt; A, vector&lt; vector&lt; vector&lt; double &gt; &gt; &gt; B); </code></pre>  <p>I believe that a large amount of the time taken by the program is simply passing <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> to my function, rather than actually performing the statistics <em>inside</em> the function.</p>  <p>Does this seem reasonable? Is there substantial overhead from passing these <code>vector</code>s to a function? If so, what is the best way to account for this? I know that I could simply put all of these functions inside a <code>class</code> and then refer to the arrays in terms of a class member, but I was hoping to keep these functions class agnostic if possible.</p>
