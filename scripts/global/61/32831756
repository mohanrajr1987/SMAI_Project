<p>For educational purposes, I need to figure out how to load a half-word from a memory address to a register using only the lw and sw instructions in MIPS. </p>  <p><strong>I am aware you can use lh, sh, lb, and sb but I want to know how to do it with only lw and sw.</strong></p>  <p>For example, load the two bytes "AB" into register $t0:</p>  <pre><code>Mem: [ A ] [ B ] [ C ] [ D ]       100   200   300   400  $t0: [ 0 ] [ 0 ] [ A ] [ B ] </code></pre>  <p>My solution so far:</p>  <pre><code>lw  $t0, 100($zero) srl $t0, t0, 16 </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to do the same operation using <em>only</em> sw and lw instructions and <strong>no other operations</strong>? </p>
