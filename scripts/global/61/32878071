<p>in my local machine I am running an web application in JBoss server. I am using JVisual VM for profiling my application. When I am trying to point/connect to JBoss with JVisual VM, My application is getting tremendously slow or its getting down(not working any more). </p>  <p>I want to do instrumentation profiling to get the actual memory usage for various objects. </p>  <p>OS: Windows 7 Enterprise Processor: Core 2 Duo @3.00GHz 3.00GHz RAM: 4.00 GB</p>  <p>Any suggestion or help would be highly appreciated.</p>  <p>Cheers, Ehtesham</p>
