<p>There are 2 web site A, B. Web site A  has a resource, such as <a href="http://www.a.com/resource1" rel="nofollow">http://www.a.com/resource1</a>. Web site B has a page <a href="http://www.b.com/page1" rel="nofollow">http://www.b.com/page1</a>, which has content. And I want <a href="http://www.a.com/resource1" rel="nofollow">http://www.a.com/resource1</a> to be part of the content. </p>  <p>It is like youtube, you can embed youtube video into other web site page in another web site.</p>  <p>I am looking for a basic example, which demonstrates how this is done. Front end HTML, iframe, javascript pseudo code is good enough.</p>
