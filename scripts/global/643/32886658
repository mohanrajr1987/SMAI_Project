<p>Its just a general question and I wanted to get a final answer on this, as I believe that according to Ebay's new policy, iframe or javascript cannot be included into listings anymore due to security and etc... reasons.</p>  <p>My queation is - <strong>Why is it that I still see listings on Ebay with javascript and iframes?</strong></p>  <p>Is that because the code was put there before this policy came out? and the user just keeps relisting it?</p>  <p>Or is there a real way around this problem?</p>  <p>Really appreciate your help on this, Thank You. </p>
