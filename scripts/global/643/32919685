<p>I wrote a html code which initializes my iframe with another site.</p>  <p>my domain is for example:  </p>  <p>www.mydomain.com/Index.html</p>  <p>in this there's an </p>  <pre><code> &lt;iframe src = "www.anotherdomain.com/pages/firstPage.html"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to detect the complete new src url whenever the iframe gets new one. The iframe text consists links to other pages within the initialised page. Is it possible and legal to get it done ? Thanks. Any help is appreciated. </p>  <p>I guess it goes to cross origin issues but is there a work around for this ?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I tried to get the answer by </p>  <pre><code> document.getElementById("myIframeId").src </code></pre>  <p>at the frame load event. But it keeps showing the src with which it is initialised. It is not showing the updated src.</p>  <pre><code>document.getElementById("myIframeId").contentWindow.location.href </code></pre>  <p>gives the Security Error that a http frame is trying to access https in the iframe. Protocols mismatched.</p>  <p>I made the localhost to SSL and used https but the request got blocked. I don't know why.</p>
