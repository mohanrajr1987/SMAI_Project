<p>I have a Facebook Comment plugin.  The Facebook generated iFrame is fixed height so the "reply as" menu is hidden and cannot display outside of the iFrame.<br> I discovered on click of the "reply as", the function m.extend._resizeiframe is changing the class of the iframe from class="fb_ltr" to class="fb_ltr fb_iframe_widget_lift" which has a larger height attribute.  This event is not triggering in some cases â€“ it seems if there is more than one comment, this event will not trigger:  m.extend._resizeiframe.  I suspect it is a bug that Facebook needs to address.  Any suggestions for a workaround?</p>  <p>Facebook has confirmed this is a bug: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/1902507659974826/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/1902507659974826/</a></p>  <p>Thanks for the direction CBroe! </p>
