<p>I know similar questions have been asked before, but all solutions that have been given in the past required access to the iframe id.</p>  <p>I am embedding a script that generates an iframe upon page load and also generates a fresh iframe id each time. Unfortunately the content is also highly dynamic and the content often changes dramatically, so a fixed height solution is just not going to cut it.</p>  <p>Looking for a solution to fit iframe to content height on page load without the need of an iframe id.</p>
