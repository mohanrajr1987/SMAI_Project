<p>With the help of the following code i am able to embed google search bar within my website</p>  <pre><code>&lt;iframe id="if1" width="100%" height="254" style="visibility:visible" src="http://www.google.com/custom?q=&amp;btnG=Search"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but it has certain drawbacks, user can't go back to the previous page and cannot perform more than one search at a time,</p>  <p>is there a way i can embed web browser within my web page ??</p>
