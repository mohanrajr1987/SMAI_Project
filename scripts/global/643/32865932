<p>a similar question has already been asked, but I didn't quite get the answer I was hoping for. So maybe one of you can clear things up a bit for me:</p>  <p>I work for a travel company and we offer our affiliate partners the possibility to integrate our booking mask via iframe on their websites. </p>  <p>I recently set up a second booking site and embedded our own affiliate iframe. The result, however, is that I can no longer see how many clicks I generated via the iframe. Before, I used to have just a link to our company website and I could easily see the traffic through Channels>Acquisitions>Referral. </p>  <p>This is how the iframe looks like: <code>&lt;iframe src="https://www.website123.com/partner_iframe_landing.php?partner_ID=z7Yb2b5DncB9TTgk&amp;amp;ort_ab=000015&amp;amp;ort_an=003600" width="550" height="470" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>  <p>Basically I don't care whether I am tracking the clicks through our company's GA account or through the new website's account as long as I can get the data, I'm fine with it. </p>  <p>Is there any simple way to track this?</p>  <p>Looking forward to your replies</p>  <p>Christina</p>
