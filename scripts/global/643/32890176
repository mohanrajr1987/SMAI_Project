<p>I got clients, which have an iframe on theirs website, where my products are shown. Each product has its individual og:image and twitter:image meta tag and a twitter/fb share button. </p>  <p>Unfortunately twitter and facebook just read the meta tags of the clients website and not the once in the iframe, so the picuters and descriptions posted are wrong. Also there is a case where one customer has his own og and twitter meta tags, in this case twitter/fb are reading the customers og meta tags. </p>  <p>The solution I am searching, is that if someone clicks the share button, which is in the iframe, twitter and fb get the open graph meta tags informations from the iframe. </p>  <p>Is this possible and with what kind of technology, can I say to twitter/fb to fetch my og meta tags from the iframe and not the ones from the top site. I have seen examples how to read the meta tags in the iframe using jquery, but how to hand it over to twitter and fb? So that on a page with containing my iframe, the metatags inside the iframe are read athorwise from the main website.</p>  <p>Thank you for reading my question and hopefully someone has a good idea.</p>
