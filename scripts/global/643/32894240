<p>I am building an <code>iFrame</code> to be used by third parties. Now, for the <code>iFrame</code>, I need some vendor files like <code>jQuery, jQuery-UI, jQuery-validate, font-awesome</code>. This has elongated the loading process. What are the solutions for faster loading??</p>  <p>Some solutions that I have in mind are:</p>  <p>1) Most probably the client will have some of them already loaded. Some how if I could use them, that could shorten the loading time. But I tried doing that with no success.</p>  <p>2) The customer is likely to browse through the client site before using my <code>iFrame</code>. If I could use that time to download the files and then inject them into the <code>iFrame</code>, it could too shorten the time lag.</p>  <p><strong>My Approach:</strong></p>  <p>I added the <code>jQuery</code> file to the <code>head</code> of the <code>iFrame</code> as shown below:</p>  <pre><code>var s = document.createElement("script"); s.type = "text/javascript"; s.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.selectboxit/3.8.0/jquery.selectBoxIt.min.js'; $('#pg-iframe').contents().find("head").append(s); </code></pre>  <p>However when the server renders the page of <code>iFrame</code>, the head tag is replaced by the head tag of the rendered page. As a result, I need to have the <code>script</code> tags in the html page too thereby ending with multiple downloads.</p>  <p>Am I thinking the right way or have messed it up. It could be great to have some feedback.</p>
