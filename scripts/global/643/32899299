<p>We are injecting a 300px JS frame into a body of HTML.</p>  <p>This moves the entire page to the right 300px. On a 1200px monitor, it doesnt necessarily look bad, but on a larger 1600 or 1900 wide res, it looks terrible. 4" of white space, etc.</p>  <p>I can use @media to come up with some standards for adding a inline styles, but I was hoping for something that could adapt more.</p>  <p>So for instance, on 1500px+ widths; this looks ok:</p>  <pre><code>position: relative; right: -300px; </code></pre>  <p>On narrower monitors, </p>  <pre><code>position: relative; right: -7%; </code></pre>  <p>or </p>  <pre><code>position: relative; right: -10%; </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone have any good ideas to make this more programmatic, vs defined?</p>
