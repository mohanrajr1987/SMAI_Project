<p>The website I'm developing recently uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a> framework. There is no problem about responsiveness while directly visiting the site.</p>  <p>There is another domain name (<strong>domainB</strong>) and I'm using URL embed method and it loads the actual site.</p>  <p>While visiting the domainB on a <strong>mobile</strong> device, the responsiveness doesn't work, it loads the <strong>desktop</strong> site not the mobile-size one.</p>  <p>So, my question:</p>  <h2>How to detect if the site is loaded inside an iframe on a mobile device?</h2>  <p>I saw <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/326069/how-to-identify-if-a-webpage-is-being-loaded-inside-an-iframe-or-directly-into-t">that</a> question and by that method it can be understood if the webpage is being loaded inside an iframe but how to detect if the visitor is on a <strong>mobile device</strong>?</p>  <hr>  <p><em>(I don't have any code control on domainB, the URL embed feature is served by domain name registrar company.)</em></p>  <p><em>(There could be some SEO issues about this, I know this.)</em></p>
