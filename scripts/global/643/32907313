<p>I am looking for a way to resize an iframe in the y-axis that the content fits in.</p>  <p>The problem is, all solutions that I can find on the web are not working anymore because of the modern CORS and Same Origin rules of the browsers.</p>  <p>But there must be a way to do it, as ebay is still able to fit the iframes according to the height of the content. First, I thought this might be server-sided, but disabling JS showed me the initial height of the iframe is something around <code>10k px</code>.</p>  <p>Which property of the child-frame are they using that is available for the parent frame?</p>
