<p>Let suppose, the webapp has list of external URLs. User clicks one of those URLs and goes to another website. How do I show the first webapp's header on top of the other websites?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stumbleupon.com/</a> These guys use iframe for this purpose, but if I will try to add a page from pinterest, for example, then I will get only the stumbleupon's header and blank body because <code>x-frame-options</code> of pinterest is set to <code>sameorigin</code>.</p>  <p>Thank you for your time! Please, upvote if you don't know the answer</p>
