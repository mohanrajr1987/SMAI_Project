<p>first of all, I do not have edge. I'm trying to do things a little differently than what edge produces as a compiled product. I'm trying to load the ad that I've created in an iframe, by getting the HTML source from my server and putting it on someone else's site. However, when i do this, i get a 404 when trying to load the my_project.js</p>  <pre><code>AdobeEdge.loadComposition('my_project', 'EDGE-3920837221', {     scaleToFit: "width",     centerStage: "none",     minW: "0",     maxW: "undefined",     width: "2640px",     height: "1440px" }, {"dom":{}}, {"dom":{}}); </code></pre>  <p>the reason for this is because of how iframes loads relative scripts using the origin of the top window (if the iframe is friendly). My question is: how do i get edge to respect an absolute script path.</p>  <p>and a follow up question: can I load the scripts in a logical order: </p>  <ol> <li>edge.5.0.1</li> <li>my_project.js</li> <li>run config</li> </ol>  <p>I tried doing this first, but got a bunch of errors :/</p>
