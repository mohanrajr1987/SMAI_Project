<p>I have implemented a custom shell using "clish". I need to add pagination of command output. I couldn't find any standalone libraries for this.</p>  <p>My understanding is that ncurses is used by many linux utilities to add pagination feature. But I could not find any helpful tutorials for this.</p>  <p>Can someone point me in the right direction? Is there any other simpler tool for this?</p>
