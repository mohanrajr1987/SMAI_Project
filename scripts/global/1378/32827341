<p>This query is pulling results from a database but there are so many results it's causing the page to hang, is there a way to paginate the results?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $results = $wpdb-&gt;get_results("SELECT * FROM ns_light WHERE    donation_id != 0 AND light_date BETWEEN '2015-02-01' AND '2016-01-31' ORDER BY light_date DESC", OBJECT) ?&gt;  &lt;?php foreach ( $results as $l ) : ?&gt;  &lt;?php include('single-light-loop.php') ?&gt;  &lt;?php endforeach ?&gt; </code></pre>
