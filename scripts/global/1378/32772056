<p>What's an efficient way to go about paginating through a table in Cassandra via asynchronous calls in a web app? </p>  <p>I know that you can pull one more row than the page size and send that value on the client so that they can use it as a starting point for the next call, but that tightly couples Cassandra and the client.</p>  <p>Is there a better practice for this situation?  </p>
