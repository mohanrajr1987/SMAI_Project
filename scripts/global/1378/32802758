<p>I think I understand the use of django's template tools: <code>{% autoescape off %}</code> and <code>{{ somehting|safe }}</code>, but I'm not sure they apply to what I need.  And if they do, they aren't working...</p>  <p>So, I have a multiple forms with get and post methods on the same page.  Both methods (for searching and posting) retain the <code>&amp;</code> symbol in the url. But when I use the get method(search) then use the post method after, I get <code>&amp;amp</code> ; instead of <code>&amp;</code>.</p>  <p>navigate to page:<br/> <code>.../something/</code><br> get method after returns:<br/> <code>.../something/?search=somethingelse&amp;search_location=anotherthing</code>  </p>  <p>pagination works well still (so its not hrefs)<br/> post method after all this returns:<br/> <code>.../something/?search=somethingelse&amp; amp;search_location=anotherthing&amp; amp;page=5</code>  </p>  <p>and if I keep posting I get a sequence of amp;:<br/></p>  <pre><code>.../something/?search=somethingelse&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;search_location=anotherthing&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;page=5   </code></pre>  <p>I think it might be the <code>{{crsf_token}}</code> require for post forms that encodes it.<br> I also tried <code>mark_safe()</code> in the <code>views.py</code><br> I've been looking for some time now.  Any help would be appreciated</p>
