<p>I'm anxious to see an example of pagination in a flux environment, I can't wrap my mind around how that would work. I've taken a look at <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/flux-react-router-example" rel="nofollow">redux's example</a>, but that's not really pagination, just a "load more" button. What I'm looking for is a way to paginate possibly millions of records (so you must use lazy loading).</p>  <p>Here are a few of the pitfalls I'm running into:</p>  <p>1) Someone could load page 20 without loading pages 1-19 (by clicking on a hyperlink, for example).</p>  <p>2) If someone edited a record inline, and then that record no longer satisfied the filter used to include in that list, we'll need to load more data to fill in the empty space left behind.</p>  <p>3) Monitoring props for changes to the page number, you'll need to load more data if that page hasn't been loaded yet.</p>  <p>I would love some examples that note how to overcome these pitfalls. Let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks!</p>
