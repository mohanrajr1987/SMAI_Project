<p>I am trying to return all the users who have liked a specific post in Instagram, but it seems to be only returning 120 of the users who have liked the image.</p>  <p><a href="https://instagram.com/p/73rVHrnFqS/" rel="nofollow">https://instagram.com/p/73rVHrnFqS/</a></p>  <p>There is no pagination object being returned by the query.  I don't see any limits mentioned in the documentation:</p>  <p><a href="https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/likes/" rel="nofollow">https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/likes/</a></p>  <p>I was able to reproduce it using the Instagram API Console here: </p>  <p><a href="https://apigee.com/console/instagram?req=%7B%22resource%22%3A%22get_media_likes%22%2C%22params%22%3A%7B%22query%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22template%22%3A%7B%22media-id%22%3A%221078521203135371922%22%7D%2C%22headers%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22body%22%3A%7B%22attachmentFormat%22%3A%22mime%22%2C%22attachmentContentDisposition%22%3A%22form-data%22%7D%7D%2C%22verb%22%3A%22get%22%7D" rel="nofollow">Link to Instagram Query</a></p>  <p>Is it a permissions issue with users hiding their likes from the API, or does the API limit the number of likes returned.</p>
