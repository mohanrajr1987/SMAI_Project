<p>I am having really difficult time to find the mistake on my following code. It seems all the code is correct but I am having this warning error every time I try to run the page. Does anyone has a good knowledge on how to solve this problem? Yes, I have checked the connection, which is fine and the table called event is there with event_id in the database server. Thanks in advance. </p>  <p>The code generates records from the database and separates it according to the page number. I have set 1 record per page. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning: mysql_result() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean   given in /Applications/XAMPP/xyz/xyz/xyz/event.php on line 89</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $link = mysql_connect('localhost', '#', '#'); if (!$link) {     die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());                             } $per_page = 1;   $pages_query = mysql_query("SELECT count(event_id) FROM event ORDER BY event_date");  $pages = ceil(mysql_result($pages_query, 0) / $per_page);  $page = (isset($_GET['page'])) ?
