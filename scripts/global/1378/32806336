<p>How can I make different paginations in single page? </p>  <p>This is the controller:</p>  <pre><code>public function index() {     $posts = Post::orderBy('created_at', 'DESC')-&gt;paginate(5);     $categories = Category::all();         $randomPosts = RandomPost::orderByRaw("RAND()")-&gt;paginate(2);     return view('posts.index', compact('posts', 'categories','randomPosts')); } </code></pre>  <p>When I'm in a page, and let' say click second page then both paginations change to second page. What I want to do here is to make that when I press second page on $posts then the $randomPosts will still stay in 1st page and not in the 2nd. I can't find a way how to do that on Laravel 5.1 version. </p>  <p>All in all I want to make two seperate paginations in one single page.</p>
