<p>I have a page which shows 25 items per page. I added a 'select all' (using jQuery)checkbox. I want to select all items across all pages but it selects only the items on that page. How can I make it select all items on all pages? I dont want to use datatables. </p>  <p>The site is built using Django.  All checkboxes are of same class and in same table.</p>  <p>I've heard that the Django admin provides functionality for this kind of selection. Please help.</p>  <p>This is my first post, please mention if any specifics are missing.</p>
