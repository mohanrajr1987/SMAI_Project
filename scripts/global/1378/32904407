<p>I'm developing an adminstration interface for a set of tables. I need to implement functionalities such as listing, sorting, filtering and pagination.</p>  <p>I'm using Spring Boot as a starter and Spring Data Jpa for repository. I've searched the Web for some examples about a complete solution that includes all the above functionalities. What I found included almost all of them, but appearently if there was pagination and sorting there wasn't filtering or viceversa.</p>  <p>Now I'm storing the filter in a application object on session using <code>@ModelAttribute</code> but I know that is now a good design because the applciation will extend and it becomes hard to maintain. I'm also using <code>Page</code> and <code>Pagination</code> for pagination purpose and using <code>Specifications</code> for filtering.</p>  <p>What I want is to submit all the data, i.e.: search fields, sorted fields and current page, in a single request. Off course if the search fields are not empty the pagination will be reinitialize. </p>  <p>Another thing is that I don't want to use jQuery  datatables but plain HTML and form submission.</p>  <p>Here are some tutorials and examples that I found:</p>  <p><a href="http://springinpractice.com/2012/05/11/pagination-and-sorting-with-spring-data-jpa" rel="nofollow">Link 1</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/spring-framework/spring-data-jpa-tutorial-part-seven-pagination/" rel="nofollow">Link 2</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
