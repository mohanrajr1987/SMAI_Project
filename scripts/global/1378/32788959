<p>From the API docs dynamo db does support pagination for scan and query operations. The catch here is to set the <code>ExclusiveStartIndex</code> of current request to the value of the <code>LastEvaluatedIndex</code> of previous request to get next set (logical page) of results.</p>  <p>I'm trying to implement the same but I'm using <code>DynamoDBMapper</code>, which seems to have lot more advantages like tight coupling with data models.  So if I wanted to do the above, I'm assuming I would do something like below:</p>    <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>// Mapping of hashkey of the last item in previous query operation Map&lt;String, AttributeValue&gt; lastHashKey = ..  DynamoDBQueryExpressoin expression = new DynamoDBQueryExpression();  ... expression.setExclusiveStartKey(); List&lt;Table&gt; nextPageResults = mapper.query(Table.class, expression); </code></pre>  <p>I hope my above understanding is correct on paginating using DynamoDBMapper.  Secondly, how would I know that I've reached the end of results. From the docs if I use the following api:</p>  <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>QueryResult result = dynamoDBClient.query((QueryRequest) request); boolean isEndOfResults = StringUtils.isEmpty(result.getLastEvaluatedKey()); </code></pre>  <p>Coming back to using DynamoDBMapper, how can I know if I've reached end of results in this case.</p>
