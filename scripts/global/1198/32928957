<p>I am using a <code>match</code> expression and getting a much different result than I expected. In my case the value of <code>wi.State</code> = <code>"Done"</code> so I expected the <code>wi.Close()</code> call to be executed and that's it. However it runs that and then runs the statements that come after the <code>_ -&gt;</code> catch-all match as well. Clearly I misunderstand how these expressions are supposed so work so I will appreciate any pointers.</p>  <pre><code>workItemCollection.Cast&lt;WorkItem&gt;() |&gt; Seq.iter(fun wi -&gt;     wi.Open()     match wi.State with     | "Done"     | "Removed" -&gt;          wi.Close()     | _ -&gt;         printfn "Closing %s -&gt;  %i" iccmCallNumber wi.Id         wi.State &lt;- "Done"         wi.History &lt;- wi.History + "Closed by Iccm to Tfs integration"         wi.Save()) </code></pre>
