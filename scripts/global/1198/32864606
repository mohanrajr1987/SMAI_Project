<p>I'm constructing some build scripts using FAKE for a TeamCity setup. Part of my build requires me to access the <code>teamcity.build.branch</code> parameter, however because it's not an environment variable, I'm not sure how to access it.</p>  <p>I've tried adding <code>%teamcity.build.branch%</code> to an environment variable in TeamCity but it doesn't seem to like that. I also can't access it using the FAKE git module because team city agents don't use git to get the project files, TeamCity hands it to them.</p>  <p>How would I go about getting the <code>teamcity.build.branch</code> parameter through to my FAKE scripts? Ideally I'd like it as an environment variable so I can pick it up straight from within the script, but I'm open to any other ideas.</p>
