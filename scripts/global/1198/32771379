<p>I'm attempting a port of <a href="http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">GeographicLib</a> into F#.  Ideally, I'd like it to be available as a PCL library, so that it can be accessed from Xamarin.  Unfortunately, the MathNet.Numerics and MathNet.Numerics.FSharp packages are not compatible with PCL.</p>  <p>My first stumbling block are the absence of the hyperbolic trig function <code>Trig.Atanh</code>, and of a representation of <code>Precision.MachineEpsilon</code>, from the standard numerical libraries.  I have searched online, but drawn a blank for the most efficient way to implement these.</p>  <p>Is there a straightforward way to find the optimal implementation of these functions?</p>
