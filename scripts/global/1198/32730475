<p>Is there any way to get tuple length. I mean for something like let <code>a=(1,2,3)</code>. I must get <code>3</code>.</p>  <p>I have used the following code to convert a tuple to a list and tried to get the length of the list, but the result has <code>option</code> type and I cannot work with it.</p>  <pre><code>let tupleToList t =      if Microsoft.FSharp.Reflection.FSharpType.IsTuple(t.GetType())          then Some (Microsoft.FSharp.Reflection.FSharpValue.GetTupleFields t |&gt; Array.toList)         else None </code></pre>
