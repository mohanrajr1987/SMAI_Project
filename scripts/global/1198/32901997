<p>I have just faced with the following code.</p>  <pre><code>let rec Make_Segment list=   match list with   | []  -&gt;[],[]   | hd::tail when hd&lt;=tail.Head -&gt; let current,rest=Make_Segment tail                                    hd::current,rest   | hd::tail when hd&gt;tail.Head -&gt; [hd], tail  let segments= [3;4;5;5;1;2;3]  Make_Segment segments  </code></pre>  <p>It is a recursive function which always <strong>return two lists</strong>. But as you can see, it always uses one parameter,which is the <code>list</code>, in its match. So where is the first argument?</p>  <p>How can it works?</p>
