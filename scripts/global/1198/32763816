<p>I recently started learning how to program in F# and I have an assignment that is giving me some serious headaches.</p>  <p>I have to make a function that takes two arguments, an integer and a five element tuple of integers, and returns true if the sum of any three elements of the tuple is greater than the first argument, else false. </p>  <p>I started designing my code this way </p>  <pre><code>{ let t3 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) let intVal = 1 let check intVal t3 =  for t3     if (*sum of any three elements*) &gt; intVal then true     else false } </code></pre>  <p>but at this point I am stuck and do not know how to proceed.</p>
