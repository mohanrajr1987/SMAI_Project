<p>After migration to the new server <strong>sometimes</strong> i run into the issue:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>mod_fcgid: stderr: PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function   Collaboration\\getAllResources() in....</p> </blockquote>  <p>But in my code i can see following line:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>$tmp = \Collaboration\getAllResources();</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried to use "use" statement, but it did not help. I also tried all possible solutions I found.</p>  <p>I'm using:<br/> <strong>PHP Version 5.5.9-1ubuntu4.11</strong><br/> <strong>Drupal    7.39</strong></p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
