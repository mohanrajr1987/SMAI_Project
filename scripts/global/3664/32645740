<p>Let's say we have a class implemented in a PHP extension called <code>My\Example\Object</code>. To allow for graceful degredation, I would like to provide a standard PHP implementation for the same class, also as <code>My\Example\Object</code>. If the extension is loaded, would it use the extension one instead of the PHP class? Assume that we're using the Composer autoloader if that makes any difference.</p>  <p>So, with the extension loaded, would the following use the <code>.php</code> file at all?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  use My\Example\Object;  new Object(); </code></pre>
