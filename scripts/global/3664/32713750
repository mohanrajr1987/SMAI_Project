<p>I am refactoring a big PHP project (more than 500 PHP files) into namespace tree structure.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get Eclipse PDT automatically add <em>use ...</em> at the top of the file when an undefined class is encountered?</p>  <p>Otherwise: is there a way to get Eclipse PDT highlight undefined classes, so that i can do sort of <em>right click -> add namespace</em>, like in Microsoft Visual Studio?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
