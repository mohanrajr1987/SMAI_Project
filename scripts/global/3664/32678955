<p>When adding a WCF web service to my client, the complied classes and methods that have the same name the 2nd class or namespace values are being appended with "1" at the end. However, I believe if 2 classes that have the same signatures but have different <code>namespaces</code>, this shouldn't happen. </p>  <p>Example of what is going on</p>  <p>1st class</p>  <pre><code>Namespace nameS1     Partial Public Class value     End class </code></pre>  <p>2nd class</p>  <pre><code>Namespace nameS2      Partial Public Class value      End class </code></pre>  <p>The compiled code..</p>  <pre><code>&lt;System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute(),  _  System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("System.Runtime.Serialization", "4.0.0.0"),  _  System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute(Name:="value", [Namespace]:="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/nameS1"),  _  Partial Public Class value  End Class   &lt;System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute(),  _  System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("System.Runtime.Serialization", "4.0.0.0"),  _  System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute(Name:="value", [Namespace]:="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/nameS2"),  _  Partial Public Class value1  End Class </code></pre>  <p>Do I need to anything to stop this from happening? I could put them into 2 different webservices but I am not allowed to do this.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>Ok I think I know what it is, when the 2 classes are complied and added to the cilent, the code is then put into 1 single namespace (the name of the service reference I give it) I guess this is by design, however, is there anything I can do to prevent this? </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
