<p>I have a class in which I find myself define similar groups of variables many times, to the point that I believe it would be clearer if I were able to do so in a loop, as follows:</p>  <pre><code>import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk  class MyClass:     def __init__(self):         self.initializeVariables()      def initializeVariables(self):         varnames = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']         for var in varnames:             exec("self.bg{0} = ttk.Frame(self.Frame)".format(var))             exec("self.tb{0} = ttk.Entry(bg{0}, width=4)".format(var))             exec("self.tb{0}.grid(row=i)".format(var)) </code></pre>  <p>I have more elements than this, this example is just meant to be illustrative. I would like to know:</p>  <ol> <li>Is there a way to accomplish this without using the <code>exec</code> function? I tried with <code>globals()</code>, but was not successful</li> <li>Is doing this inadvisable? In my opinion, this makes the code easier to read, but I am not aware of typical conventions in this arena.</li> </ol>
