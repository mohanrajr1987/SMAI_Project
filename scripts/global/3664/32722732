<p>I am trying to build a solution created elsewhere on my system. The XAML files reference a few third party namespaces, several of which give the error in the title. The solution does compile and run despite these issues. </p>  <p>I am using VS 2015 on Windows 7 system. I tried compiling the same solution with VS 2015 on Windows 10 with no problem. Having said that I do not believe the issue has anything to do with the OS as I am fairly certain that when I started this exercise, I did not see this issue. I believe it crept in at some point along the way as I was investigating other issues.</p>  <p>Below are the namespaces for which I had issues.</p>  <pre><code>    xmlns:tb="http://www.hardcodet.net/taskbar"     xmlns:Controls="clr-namespace:MahApps.Metro.Controls;assembly=MahApps.Metro"     xmlns:ToggleSwitch="clr-namespace:ToggleSwitch;assembly=ToggleSwitch" </code></pre>  <p>I was able to work around the issue for MahApps.Metro and ToggleSwitch by uninstalling the packages and reinstalling from NuGet, but I should not have to do this. I have not found a workaround for taskbar. Apparently it is obsolete so I cannot install/uninstall it from NuGet. However, I have the DLL so I would think I should be okay.</p>  <p>There are other postings that are somewhat similar where rebuilds or changing build types have resolved this issue but none of these worked for me. I have also tried using VS 2013 (which is what was used to build the solution originally).</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
