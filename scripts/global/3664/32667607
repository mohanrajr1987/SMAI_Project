<p>I just discovered a bug which was introduced by automatically renaming a method argument in IntelliJ IDEA. The result was that the argument was shadowed inside the method body by a local val of the same name, like so:</p>  <pre><code>def foo(arg: Int): Int = {   val arg = 1   arg }  assert(foo(2)) // fail </code></pre>  <p>(To make things worse, the compiler didn't get suspicious because of the type-unsafe <code>==</code> that I used to compare the value).</p>  <p>Is there any possible <strong>reason why Scala would allow to shadow a method argument by a value in the top-level of the method body?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> And is there a compiler option that I can use to avoid these things to happen?</p>
