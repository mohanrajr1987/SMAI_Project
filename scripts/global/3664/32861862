<p>I have no chance to access the namespace definitions in Python using <code>xml.etree.ElementTree</code>:</p>  <p>Attributes of the RootElement:</p>  <pre><code>xmlns="http://www.adv-online.de/namespaces/adv/gid/6.0" xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2" test="xxx" </code></pre>  <p>rootElemt.attrib only contains the attribute "test" the ns-definitions are ignored by the parser.</p>  <p>I have already written a lot of functions that work with Etree.elements so switching to another type is the last option.</p>  <p>I know that lxml is capable of getting the Namespaces but Im scared of using it because I don't want to install the dependencys  on the users computer.</p>  <p>Is there another lib that is capable of doing this job.</p>  <p>thanks</p>
