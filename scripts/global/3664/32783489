<p>I want to ask you how to make ideal folder structure for PHP MVC with namespaces. <em>(I want to focuse to pure PHP.)</em></p>  <p>I have found something like below, but it is really poor solution, mainly for bigger project, becouse you have only 3 main folders (MVC) and you can not simply copy one part to a server, because it is in 3 folders.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rTGPX.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>So how to figure it out? I think main problem is with MVC parts, which has to be together. So maybe do something like this? And what about files in the folders?</p>  <ul> <li>My App/  <ul> <li>Users/  <ul> <li>Autentization/  <ul> <li>Controllers/</li> <li>Models/</li> <li>View/</li> </ul></li> <li>Controllers/</li> <li>Models/</li> <li>Views/</li> </ul></li> <li>Articles/</li> <li>...</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>What is the best solution of dividing classes into namespaces in PHP? I understand Java, for example, but this in PHP + MVC parts are little confusing for me.</p>
