<p>Using t-code SEGW, I created a SAP Gateway project with several data models based on RFC function modules. The data structure is based on the handy "Import" funtionality.</p>  <p>Due to a customer request, I had to copy the project into another, customer owned, namespace.</p>  <p>After the copy, I lost the funtionality to import fields to the data models. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lZEWN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lZEWN.png" alt="As seen here"></a></p>  <p>When I create a new entity, the possibility to import is still there. When I copy a fully working project, lets say to $tmp, I lose the import feature again.</p>  <p>Sure, I can still edit my entities by hand but it is tiresome and prone to errors.</p>  <p>So, my question, is there a way to re-enable the import feature of copied SAP Gateway projects?</p>
