<p>I have a class in which I declare a friendship to another class outside the namespace. Now that class has a static integer I want to access. </p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>    class A     {     public:         void init();     };       namespace C     {      class B      {        friend class ::A;      private:         static int i;     };     }       void A::init()     {         C::B::i=3;     }      int main()     {         A f;          f.init();          return 0;     } </code></pre>  <p>Now if I compiled this code I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>  /tmp/ccmDINqo.o: In function `A::init()':   friendclass.cpp:(.text+0xa): Undefined reference to `C::B::i'   collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status </code></pre>  <p>Now for what I understand, the declaration is there so <code>init()</code> is actually trying to assign a value to <code>i</code>.</p>  <p>I think compilation works fine, but the linker seems to complain.</p>  <p>Why does this code not build and how can I fix it so it will build?</p>
