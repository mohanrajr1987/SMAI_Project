<p>I am interested in the geographic coordinates of banks, central banks, financial institutions, universities and colleges. This is my query:</p>  <pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT ?label ?lat ?long WHERE {   {?x dct:subject category:International_finance_institutions } UNION   {?x dct:subject category:Federal_Reserve_Banks } UNION    {?x dct:subject category:Central_banks } UNION    {?x a &lt;http://schema.org/CollegeOrUniversity&gt; }.      ?x geo:lat ?lat .      ?x geo:long ?long .      ?x rdfs:label ?label.         FILTER (LANGMATCHES(LANG(?label), 'en'))  } </code></pre>  <p>Exactly this code worked (last download: June 21st, 2015). This morning however I keep getting this error: <code>Virtuoso 37000 Error SP030: SPARQL compiler, line 5: Undefined namespace prefix at 'category' before '}'</code>. I was checking <a href="http://dbpedia.org/sparql?nsdecl" rel="nofollow">the list of predefined namespaces</a>, but all seems correct. What's wrong with <code>category</code>? BTW: I also tried other codes offered on this side, and some are also not working. Did the virtuoso guys change something?</p>
