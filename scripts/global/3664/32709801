<p>I am working on a project with two sets of files, plugins and core files. These sets of files can have separate versions. My PluginAbstract file is part of the core files and I want all the plugins to extend it. When I update my core files and increment the version, I do not want to go back through all of the plugins to change the namespace. Is it possible to dynamically change the PluginAbstract object from <code>v1</code> to <code>v2</code>?</p>  <pre><code>namespace plugins\v1; class MyPlugin extends core\v1\PluginAbstract{ </code></pre>
