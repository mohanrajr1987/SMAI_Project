<p>I know it is very simple but after a couple of hours I couldn't resolve it by my self. I have included <code>termios.h</code> in the <code>.h</code> of my class and now, most of <code>#defines</code> inside termios interfere with my variable names (they are same names!) so I have compiling errors. Is there a correct way to put <code>termios.h</code> inside a namespace? then using it only where need it?</p>  <p>thank you very much</p>  <pre><code>#include termios.h class MyClass { public: bool B50;  // it interfere with #define  B50    0000001 in bits/termios.h bool B100; bool B200; // this too private: void _process(); ... } </code></pre>
