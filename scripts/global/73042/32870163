<p>I'm currently displaying a Kendo UI Grid in a modal.  I've got a few custom validations hooked up which are working fine.  When the modal's "Save" button is clicked, I need to be able to check whether the grid is currently in a valid or invalid state.  </p>  <p>Since I'm only using custom validation, it's certainly possible for me to keep a running track of the errors and then check the error count upon the modal closing, but I was hoping the Kendo UI Grid kept up with this and exposed something easy like myGrid.isValid() or some such thing.</p>
