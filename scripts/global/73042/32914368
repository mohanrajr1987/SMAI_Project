<p>I have a dragable, resizable kendo window, and inside that I want header to stay on top always and scrolling should be on wrapper only (which is working correct)  Heirarchy is following: </p>  <pre><code>Kendo Wrapper [      Kendo Div   {     Header Div     Body Div   } ] </code></pre>  <p>Hope this helps to understand and following is the css:</p>  <pre><code>.wrapper {    position: absolute; } .parentDiv {    position: relative; } .headerDiv {    position: absolute; } .bodyDiv {    position: relative; } </code></pre>  <p>I am just putting relevant css, if you need any input then let me know.</p>
