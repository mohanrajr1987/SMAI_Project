<p>I am making an AJAX call to retrieve some data via a POST request. Then, I am using that data to create a tooltip. Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>j$("#selectorID").one('mouseover',     function(e) {         var ticketType = e.target.classList[2];         var ticketID = j$(e.target).data("ticket-id");         j$.post("/Some/Url/",             { "ticketID":ticketID, "ticketType":ticketType },             function(r) {                 var title = r["title"];                 var tooltip = j$(e.target).kendoTooltip( { content: title, position: "top" } ).data("kendoTooltip");                 if (j$(e.target).is(":hover")) { tooltip.show(); }    // Race condition             }         );     } ); </code></pre>  <p>I believe there is a race condition because the tooltip, even after my mouse moved off of it, will still appear. Then I have to put my point on the element, and then move it off again, to make it disappear. What can be done to solve this?</p>  <p>I tried a few different things, including the <code>if (j$(e.target).is(":hover"))</code> condition you see there. But it still doesn't do the trick.</p>
