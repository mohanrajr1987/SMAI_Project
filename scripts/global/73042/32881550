<p>I am displaying numeric value formatted as percentage using the following:</p>  <pre><code>columns.push(             {                 field: key,                 hidden: false,                 format: "{0:p2}"             }); </code></pre>  <p>When the field is supposed to display <code>1.00%</code> it's displaying <code>100.00%</code> like wise any given value <code>it's adding zeros</code>, one more value is <code>65.37%</code> and output is <code>6,537.00%</code></p>  <p>Any settings that I am missing or anything wrong with the format? The problem is I am creating grid dynamically and hence I can't show the full grid setup.</p>  <p>In the above you can see I am pushing columns which is an array which will be passed to the function which creates grid.</p>
