<p>In the Kendo UI documentation for the <code>DataSource</code> component, it states that the <code>data</code> function is used to get data items for the data source. </p>  <p>However it also states that if the data source is bound to a JavaScript array (via the data option) the <code>data</code> method will return the items of that array. Every item from the array is wrapped in a <code>kendo.data.ObservableObject</code> or <code>kendo.data.Model</code>.</p>  <p>How can I retrieve the original unwrapped data items (i.e. having same reference) that were passed into the data source? </p>  <p>I ask because I'm using a Kendo UI treeview control and in its event handlers (e.g. check event) I want to update the original data item for a tree node based on some custom logic. </p>
