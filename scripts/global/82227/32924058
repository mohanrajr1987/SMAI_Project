<p>I currently have an 'edit account details' page on my website but I would like to customize the <strong>html</strong> so that the <strong>password change section</strong> is beside the <strong>main details section</strong> so there is not a huge space to the left.</p>  <p>The page currently (screenshot): <a href="http://prntscr.com/8n9hkt" rel="nofollow">http://prntscr.com/8n9hkt</a><br> Here is my current code: <a href="http://pastebin.com/hGUSAvz0" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/hGUSAvz0</a></p>  <p>I know that this is possible but I just don't know the code and where I should put it.</p>
