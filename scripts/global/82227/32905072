<p>I'm using WC 2.0.16, with the latest version of WP. I am testing WC with many payment gateway such as cheque payment, cash on delivery, and etc. The only issue I'm having is when the user finishes a purchase and is being redirected back to my site, they are sent to a page with an incorrect address such as "<a href="http://galerigadget.com/payment/?key=order_560bb443d3fed&amp;order=9004" rel="nofollow">http://galerigadget.com/payment/?key=order_560bb443d3fed&amp;order=9004</a>" (or "<a href="http://galerigadget.com/payment/" rel="nofollow">http://galerigadget.com/payment/</a>") and just got blank screen.</p>  <p>I already tried everything to purchase a product with all payment gateways from my website still got same error like above.</p>  <p>Why is WooCommerce or the payment gateways adding the '<a href="http://galerigadget.com/payment/" rel="nofollow">http://galerigadget.com/payment/</a>' to the head of the URL? And how can it be removed? Any help would be greatly appreciated, as the authors don't seem to be very helpful with support.</p>  <p>I can't update WC to latest version because will break my current theme.</p>  <p>You can reproduce this bug with try to buy a product from my website: <a href="http://galerigadget.com/product/lenovo-s60/" rel="nofollow">http://galerigadget.com/product/lenovo-s60/</a></p>
