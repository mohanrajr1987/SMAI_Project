<p>I would like to know is there any thing (plugin) through which I can get the following requirement achieved?  I am developing a Marketplace site in wordpress using woocommerce. And I need an option where my customers will create list of orders for the whole month(for each days individually) and save it. The same set of orders will be notified to the seller account so that they can fulfill the orders accordingly. And users should be able to modify the existing planned orders.</p>  <p>I have been looking for a solution on the same since last one month. But no use. Kindly guide me to solve this either through any plugin or by coding.. </p>
