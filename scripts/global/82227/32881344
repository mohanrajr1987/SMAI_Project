<p>I have just started with Woocommerce and searched a lot on Google and Stack Overflow about this but not able to find a solution. Below is my problem -</p>  <p>I want to disallow few specific products from being shipped outside some list of pin codes in Woocommerce. For example, I have products from A to Z, out of which products A to D (products can be in different category) can only be delivered to pin codes starting with 110, 122. Rest of the products can be delivered anywhere irrespective of the pin code. What I want to do is if any of the products A to D are added to cart by the customer and a pin code starting with 123 is entered (which is out of allowed for these products), then a message is displayed that the product cannot be delivered in your area.</p>
