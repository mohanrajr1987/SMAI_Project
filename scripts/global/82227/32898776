<p>Hi it may be a naive question because I am working with woocommerce rest api for the first time I am good with wordpress though.</p>  <p>I have a client's site which multilingual (2 languages) using WPML folder base i.e "base url for english" &amp; "/ar for other language" and everything is perfect on the browser also I am using multilingual woocommerce for this purpose now clients need an app and for that i am using woocommerce rest api and i am using this lib <a href="https://github.com/kloon/WooCommerce-REST-API-Client-Library" rel="nofollow">WooCommerce REST API PHP Client Library</a> which is working perfectly for the base folder but if I pass an lang variable in $_GET it always shows following error:</p>  <pre>      {       "errors": [         {           "code": "woocommerce_api_authentication_error",           "message": "Invalid Signature - provided signature does not match"         }       ]     }  </pre>  <p>I am passing variables like </p>  <pre>      http:// example.com/?mode=api&action=categories&lang=ar  </pre>  <p>and in library I am setting lang variable like this</p>  <pre>      if(isset($_REQUEST['lang'])){         $lang=$_REQUEST['lang'];     }      $client = new WC_API_Client('http://example.com/'.$lang, 'ck________________', 'cs_______________', $options);  </pre>  <p>Its working perfectly on the localhost but on server (client have unmanaged vps which I install vesta cp on it) its only working if there is no $lang variable defined no its just showing me one language's product.</p>  <p>I tried all the method find on the different forums but still didn't get it work can please some one help me to understand what I am doing wrong. Also i really need this without HTTPS.</p>  <p>Is there any way around or could suggest me better way to do it basically i want  to make rest api for mobile app so what ever the best way i would really appreciate it.</p>
