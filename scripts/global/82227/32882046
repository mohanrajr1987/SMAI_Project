<p>I am developing a Wordpress website with the Woocommerce plugin. The theme I am using is equipped with a page builder. To retain this functionality while being able to extend the My Account page I have managed to make shortcodes to display the orders, show and edit the addresses. </p>  <p>One thing is not working fine, and I can't figure out why. This is clicking on the View button of a recent order. It is redirecting my back to the My Account page.  With the help of the debugger I still can't figure out what I am missing. </p>  <p>Before I created these shortcodes I searched the web for an answer to the best way of customizing the Account page with a page builder. This I have not been able to find. </p>  <p>Now my question, is there any recommended way of customizing the account page with a theme with a page builder? To me it seems that shortcodes are the only logical solution.</p>  <p>Furthermore, is there any documentation from Woocommerce regarding this topic?</p>
