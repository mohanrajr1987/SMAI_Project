<p>I am adding custom fees dynamically on the checkout page with ajax using a session depending on the entered billing address postcode. I cant reload the page because previously entered details are lost, so i need to reload the order review section with ajax or using a woocommerce front end function.</p>  <p>Whenever you change the address details the order review section is updated how can i trigger this manually with jquery or javascript?</p>  <p>Many thanks, Alistair</p>
