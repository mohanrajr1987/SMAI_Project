<p>I have a Wordpress site that uses Woocommerce and Paypal. I've setup a sandbox to be able to test Paypal purchases.</p>  <p>When the order goes through, I end up on a Paypal "<strong>Thanks for your order</strong>" page which is fine except that it gives a link which states, "<strong>Return to  &lt; email address>"</strong>.  The text of the link is confusing.  I'd like it to say, "<strong>Return to &lt; Business Name></strong>". </p>  <p>I've seen other questions about this online and all the answers say upgrade Paypal to a business account.  I already have a business account and I've filled out the profile properly, but I can't get it to say "<strong>Return to &lt; Business Name ></strong>".  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.</p>
