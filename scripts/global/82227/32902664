<p>How can I charge different tax rates based on the shipping method a customer selects at checkout in Woocommerce? My store has one shipping option that lets international customers avoid the 7% VAT charged here in Thailand. </p>  <p>Here's how to disable taxes when Local Pickup is selected as the shipping option according to Woocommerce documentation: </p>  <pre><code>add_filter( 'woocommerce_apply_base_tax_for_local_pickup', '__return_false' ); </code></pre>  <p>But how do I disable taxes on a custom shipping option?</p>  <p>Edit: I've started to work out a solution, but I could use some help with line 2. i.e. How to get the current shipping method?</p>  <pre><code>function remove_tax_for_fob( $cart ) {     $ok_remove = get_shipping_method( 'FOB' );     if ($ok_remove){          $cart-&gt;remove_taxes(); } return $cart; }  add_action( 'woocommerce_calculate_totals', 'remove_tax_for_fob' ); </code></pre>
