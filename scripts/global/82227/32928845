<p>I know it's possible to add checkboxes and other via html to a woocommerce single product description / brief description of product (done that). Is it possible / what are the hooks, in order to save given customer selections and pass the information on to the cart? Customers are able to make choices but unfortunately no information is passed on by woocommerce.</p>  <p>thanks</p>
