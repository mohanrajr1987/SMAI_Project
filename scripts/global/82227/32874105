<p>So first I'll say the plugin works fine, returns correct rates and all that perfectly. What I am attempting to do is send to paypal a custom attribute that displays which UPS service that was selected (ground, 2nd day air, 3rd day, etc).</p>  <p>I know the custom attribute is reaching paypal correctly because I tested the code as follows:  </p>  <pre><code> $paypal_args = array(                     'CUSTOM' =&gt; "THIS IS MY SHIPPING"                      ); </code></pre>  <p>And it creates the "CUSTOM" field and displays the text on my paypal dashboard when I'm looking at the order details.</p>  <p>I've tried the following with no success:</p>  <pre><code>  'CUSTOM' =&gt; $order -&gt; method_title,   &amp;   'CUSTOM' =&gt;$order -&gt; shipping_method_title, </code></pre>  <p>I feel like it's should look something like this: $order -> (whatever variable I'm missing)</p>
