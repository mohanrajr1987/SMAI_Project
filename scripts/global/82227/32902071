<p>I'm trying to change the text on the cart page from</p>  <blockquote>   <p>YOU HAVE 1 ITEM IN YOUR CART</p> </blockquote>  <p>to</p>  <blockquote>   <p>YOU HAVE 1 VOUCHER IN YOUR CART</p> </blockquote>  <p>The file that outputs this text is <code>wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/cart/cart.php</code> and it uses a hook called <code>woocommerce_before_cart_table</code> I cannot find any information on this function.</p>  <p>Other people suggested changing the woocommerce language files, but this cart text is not in the language files either.</p>  <p>Please help</p>
