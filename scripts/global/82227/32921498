<p>Since I am only selling one single product with WooCommerce, I would like to delete the shop base. I have already deleted the page "shop" which WooCommerce automatically sets up when installing, but you can still reach the shop base page by typing .../shop. </p>  <p>I know in order to deactivate it completely, I need to set line 264 to false: <a href="https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/blob/master/includes/class-wc-post-types.php#L264" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/blob/master/includes/class-wc-post-types.php#L264</a></p>  <p>I am very new to programming though, can someone tell me how to do this?</p>
