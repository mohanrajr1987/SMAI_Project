<p>WooCommerce: How do I use an Add to Cart button on a normal page?</p>  <p>I want to use the Add to Cart button on a normal page. Currently, I'm also using a plugin called Direct Checkout that should redirect the customer from cart to checkout.</p>  <p>So anyways, this should basically place the item into the cart and move to checkout with 1 click. </p>  <p>The page is an informative page that I'd just like to have an "Add to Cart" button at the bottom of if a customer would just like to add the product to the cart from there, rather than the product page itself.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
