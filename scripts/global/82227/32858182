<p>I have created a plugin which has a separate page for order listing.. in that it looks like the same as WooCommerce's Order Listing page but. i am unable to get the comments of the order so i added my custom post type to <code>wc_order_types</code> after that there is no order listed..  its showing a empty table. ?</p>  <p><code>add_filter( 'wc_order_types',array($this,'add_wc_order_types'),10,3); public function add_wc_order_types($order_types,$type){         $order_types[] = WC_QD_PT;         return $order_types;     } </code></p>
