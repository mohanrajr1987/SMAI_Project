<p>I am facing a weird error after working on woocommerce templates. Issue is that I am seeing same reviews (reviews belonging to one particular product) across all the products, what ever the product page I open the reviews are same that of one particular product.I tried trashing that one product but the pattern has not changed and reviews are caught up from another product.</p>  <p><strong>What I changed:</strong></p>  <p>initially my aim was to load the woocommerce templates from the custom plugin I am working based on woocommerce, I have copied the woocommerce templates into my plugin folder and used below code to call each template file separately.</p>  <pre><code>function intercept_wc_template_meta($template, $template_name, $template_path) { if ($template_name == 'single-product/meta.php') {     $template = um_product_path.'woocommerce/single-product/meta.php'; }  return $template; }  add_filter('woocommerce_locate_template', 'intercept_wc_template_meta', 20, 3); </code></pre>  <p><strong>What came up:</strong></p>  <p>After doing this for all the files I tried testing with <code>var_dump($template)</code> and all the files are loading from my plugin successfully. Finally there is an error in reviews part of product page. </p>  <p>For example if I have products A, B, C, D and there are 4 reviews for product A which are shown properly on product A page, the same 4 reviews of A are being displayed/overwritten for B, C, D also instead of their own reviews. Have anyone faced this problem earlier? I am no sure what caused this error.</p>
