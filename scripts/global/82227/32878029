<p>I have two featured images on my wordpress custom post type products. </p>  <p><img src="https://scontent-mia1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/t31.0-8/11062873_1212317032115508_5672430389845875937_o.jpg" alt="featured and secondary image"></p>  <p>I registerd the secondary image with this code:</p>  <pre><code>if (class_exists('MultiPostThumbnails')) {  new MultiPostThumbnails(     array(         'label' =&gt; 'Secondary Image',         'id' =&gt; 'secondary-image',         'post_type' =&gt; 'product'     )  ); } </code></pre>  <p>Now I wish to call the secondary image. The Product image is successfully called with this funciton   <code>echo get_the_post_thumbnail( $_product-&gt;id);</code></p>  <p>However, I cannot manipulate that wordpress function to fetch the custom Secondary Image instead. I have also tried <code>the_post_thumbnail();</code> without success, and haven't found another way to grab this.</p>  <p>Edit: </p>  <p>For clarity I want to echo the secondary image on a different page. I tried using the product ID with <code>$_product-&gt;id</code> to isolate the specific post this image is related too, however,  all the available wordpress functions only fetch the Product image, and I cannot for the life of me get the other images :(</p>
