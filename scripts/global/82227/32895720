<p>I'm working on new project using WordPress and WooCommerce but I'm having trouble with checkout page.</p>  <p>I need <em>"Have a coupon?"</em> field to be at the bottom of page instead of being on the top.</p>  <p>It should appear in <em>"Your order"</em> section, above the table of products in the cart.</p>  <p>How can I do that?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
