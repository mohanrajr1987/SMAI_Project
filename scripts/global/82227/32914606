<p>I want to build a website that displays product category wise. And basic features like product detail page on clicking a product. Owner can add and remove product anytime. I do not want to sell online or have add to cart feature or any such things. </p>  <p>I have built website from scratch before. I want to use wordpress for this and have basic knowledge of wordpress. How can it be used to build this website quickly? I read about woocommerce plugin. Is it right choice? Or is there any Free theme/plugin that can be used?</p>  <p>Any guidance and links to resources will be greatly appreciated. </p>
