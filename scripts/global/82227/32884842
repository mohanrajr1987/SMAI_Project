<p>I've made a simple plugin for a client and as part of that plugin it updates the price of a product.  The SQL I've used to update this price is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = " . $_POST['product_price'][$key] . " WHERE post_id = " . $value . " AND meta_key = '_regular_price'; </code></pre>  <p>This works for the admin side of things in that if I navigate to the product via wordpress admin, the price is updated, however on the site itself the price is not updated.  If I press save changes on the product in wordpress admin it then changes it on the main site.  I'm thinking there may be some caching in place but could be wrong?</p>
