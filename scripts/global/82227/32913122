<p>Woocommerce adds 'visit store' in the admin bar in Wordpress whenever I activate it. This has the consequence that I have both a 'visit site' and a 'visit store' there. </p>  <p>However, I don't really see what the benefit is of this (please tell me if there is any) - so I want to get rid of either that or the 'visit site' link. How can I do that?</p>  <p>(My question is very similar to that of the poster here but I don't have access to that forum - maybe someone else does? <a href="http://www.kadencethemes.com/support-forums/topic/woocommerce-remove-visit-store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kadencethemes.com/support-forums/topic/woocommerce-remove-visit-store/</a>)</p>
