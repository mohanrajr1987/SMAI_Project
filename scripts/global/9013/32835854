<p>I am not sure if the correct saying is 'external environment variable'. This is a nooby problem but I could not find in the documentation of scons. I am trying to add a path by:</p>  <pre><code>env = Environment (CPPPATH = ['${PETSC_DIR}/include']) </code></pre>  <p>but scons recognize the value of <code>${PETSC_DIR}</code> as blank. I checked the value with <code>echo</code> in the shell and it gives the proper value.  How can I make scons to recognize its value?</p>
