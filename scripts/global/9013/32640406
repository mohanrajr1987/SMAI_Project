<p>I used to use Debian's alternatives system to set 'global env' like <code>java, javac, javap</code> but I've read about the disadvantages.</p>  <p>So I added</p>  <pre><code>export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk/java export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH </code></pre>  <p>to my <code>~/.bashrc</code> and when I open my terminal I can use the commands as expected but my most of my shell scripts doesn't work anymore.</p>  <p>As you can see in the picture below they check if <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> exists and executes the following command which does nothing. When I enter <code>$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -version</code> it works correctly. If I start the script in a terminal it works, too.</p>  <p>So it seems that <code>#!/bin/sh</code> doesn't <code>source .bashrc</code>? Changing it to <code>#!/bin/bash</code> doesn't solve the problem.</p>  <p>I tried to add the <code>export</code> commands to <code>/etc/profile</code> but this doesn't seem to get <code>sourced</code> at startup/login.</p>  <p>Does anyone have an idea or keywords? I think the solution is quite simple but at the moment I'm stuck.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Starting the script in the bash terminal with <code>./something.sh</code> works fine. Right click and execute or 'Open with bash' (XFCE4 context menu) does nothing.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YnHdT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YnHdT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
