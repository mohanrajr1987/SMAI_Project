<p>I have just moved to Linux (Ubuntu 15.04) and I am trying to add my python directory (:~/Documents/Python/Programs) to the path variable, but I am struggling..</p>  <p>I have tried export PATH = $PATH:~/Documents/Python/Programs, and then turning off and on again, but nothing happens I have also looked at my ~/.profile, but don't under stand it, it comes up with (I have removed a tonnes of comments from the top):</p>  <pre><code>if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then     # include .bashrc if it exists     if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then     . "$HOME/.bashrc"     fi fi  # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then     PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" fi </code></pre>  <p>UPDATE: What I am trying to do is add my python directory to PATH so that I will be able to import self made modules from within this directory</p>  <p>I was under the impression I had to add this to PATH by adding </p>  <pre><code>PATH="$HOME/Documents/Python/Programs/:$PATH" </code></pre>  <p>To the bottom of my ~/.profile document, was this wrong, and what should I actually be doing to solve this?</p>
