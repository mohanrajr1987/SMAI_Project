<p>I'm not asking about, how to set the environmental variable, I'm aware of it.</p>  <p>What is the standard Java Environment Variable on Java 8 Update 60 (Windows 7), unfortunately I overwrote it, and cannot get it back with new installation. </p>  <p>I saw some paths, separated with semicolons.</p>  <p>Additional Question: What is the environmental variable good for? And why is this variable not updating automatically?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
