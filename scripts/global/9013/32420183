<p>I have a rails app and am trying to use an environmental variable (API key) inside of a controller and it is failing. Debugging shows it's value to be nil. Weird thing is that other keys from that file are accessible, so I am not really understanding why. They are all in my secrets.yml file.</p>  <p>I have tried accessing it using both <code>ENV["STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY"]</code> and <code>Rails.application.secrets.stripe_test_secret_key</code> and both come back nil. I get the error:</p>  <p><code>No API key provided. Set your API key using "Stripe.api_key = &lt;API-KEY&gt;". You can generate API keys from the Stripe web interface. See https://stripe.com/api for details, or email support@stripe.com if you have any questions.</code></p>  <p>using the better errors gem. How do I make these available throughout my app?</p>
