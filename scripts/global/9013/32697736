<p>Someone told me to use <code>$(npm bin):PATH</code> instead of using the relative path <code>./node_modules/.bin/</code> in my PATH. This makes it so that every time the PATH is looked at, it will run <code>npm bin</code> and add its value to the PATH for that execution. This is really useful because <code>./node_modules/.bin/</code> only works when I'm in the root of my project, so if I'm in a sub-directory it doesn't work.</p>  <p>The issue is that <code>$(npm bin):PATH</code> only works on Linux machines. Does anyone know how to add a dynamic path to the PATH in Windows? Is it possible?</p>
