<p>I have been trying to install Numpy for python 3.4, and it keeps going wrong, I tried following the advice at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28919754/i-cant-seem-to-install-numpy">I can&#39;t seem to install numpy</a>, but I keep getting told that pip is not a recognised command, even after I add ;C:\Python34\Scripts; to my PATH variable, anyone know why this might be happening?</p>
