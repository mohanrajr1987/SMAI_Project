<p>I have a data frame (track) with the position (longitude - Latitude) and date (number of the day in the year) of tracking point for different animals and an other data frame (var) which gives a the mean temperature for every day of the year in different locations. </p>  <p>I would like to add a new column TEMP to my data frame (Track) where the value would be from (var) and correspond to the date and GPS location of each tracking points in (track). </p>  <p>Here are a really simple subset of my data and what I would like to obtain. </p>  <pre><code>track = data.frame(   animals=c(1,1,1,2,2),   Longitude=c(117,116,117,117,116),   Latitude=c(18,20,20,18,20),   Day=c(1,3,4,1,5))   Var = data.frame(   Longitude=c(117,117,116,116),   Latitude=c(18,20,18,20),   Day1=c(22,23,24,21),   Day2=c(21,28,27,29),   Day3=c(12,13,14,11),   Day4=c(17,19,20,23),   Day5=c(32,33,34,31)   )  TrackPlusVar = data.frame(   animals=c(1,1,1,2,2),   Longitude=c(117,116,117,117,116),   Latitude=c(18,20,20,18,20),   Day=c(1,3,4,1,5),   Temp= c(22,11,19,22,31)     ) </code></pre>  <p>I've no idea how to assign the value from the same date and GPS location as it is a column name. Any idea would be very useful ! </p>
