<p>I'm trying to set a value to a property defined in properties-service.xml in JBOSS. The value will be coming from an environment variable.</p>  <p>Say I have an environment variable <strong>MQUSER</strong>. In Unix based OS, you get the value of the variable using this notation: <strong>$MQUSER</strong> For Windows: <strong>%MQUSER%</strong></p>  <p>In my properties-service.xml file, I declare a property named <strong>mq.user</strong>. Is it possible to set the value of my property from an environment variable, just like this?</p>  <pre><code>mq.user=$MQUSER </code></pre>
