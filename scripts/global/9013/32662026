<p>I recently discovered that one version of <code>cron</code> I use supports a setting called <code>CONTENT_TYPE</code> where I can specify the content type for emails like:</p>  <pre><code>CONTENT_TYPE="text/html; charset=utf-8" </code></pre>  <p>On another server the version does not support this.  I looked at every man page I could find to no avail.  Is there a way to find out all of the supported settings for a given version of <code>cron</code>?</p>
