<p>Hello All I am Trying To add a System Variable here using powershell: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l1kO5.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l1kO5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have tried both ways using  $env:MyTestVariable = "My test variable." and However neither of them seem to add to this section. I have tried restarting the  computer as well to see if it would take effect then. I have looked at technet along with countless other websites. Please help!</p>
