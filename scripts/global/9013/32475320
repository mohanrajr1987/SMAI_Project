<p>I have a corporate computer where I am not able to alter some essential global environment variables like HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH and HOMESHARE due to group policies.</p>  <p>I am using a couple of tools integrated with Visual Studio - e.g. Git - that uses these variables and this slows the tools down considerably.</p>  <p>I am able to overcome this by locally setting the above environment variables to local drive in a cmd prompt and starting devenv from the same prompt. Everything works fine and fast.</p>  <p>This however does not work when opening a solution file by double clicking, or when the solution is opened by another tool.</p>  <p>So my questen is:  <strong>How can I set environment variables that visual studio will use every time it opens, regardless how it is opened?</strong></p>
