<p>Anyone know how I can set the environment variable value based on unix terminal command in jenkins using inject variable or some other way.  e.g CurrentBranch=<code>ls /project/folder | grep my_name</code>.  This doesn't seem to work.  I want this command,ls /project/folder | grep my_name, to be evaluated and the result should be set to CurrentBranch.  </p>  <p>Some reason CurrentBranch variable value never gets evaluated but rather it always has a value as this: <code>ls /project/folder | grep my_name</code></p>  <p>Anyone knows what I am doing wrong.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
