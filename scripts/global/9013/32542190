<p>Does any one know what might be good source(s) to read and understand all those ideas and concepts of PATH, environmental variables, make, build, linker and library. I am not a computer science major and don't have these backgrounds.  I can write code and program in C/C++/C#, but every time if i wan to use some opensource code or library, I have a lot of trouble to do the set up. Could someone suggest me some readings or key words, so i can learn these concepts from fundamental.  Highly Appreciate!! </p>
