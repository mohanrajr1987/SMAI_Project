<p>I'm trying to use the <a href="https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc" rel="nofollow">sshrc</a> to execute <code>fish</code> with my own defined functions at the remote server.</p>  <p>I know there is a <code>$fish_function_path</code> variable that I can modify to prepend my custom path with my functions, but this variable seems global and I don't want to affect other <code>fish</code> users.</p>  <p>Is there any way to change this variable only for my single fish session or any other ways to use my fish functions only for a single session?</p>  <p>I have also tried setting and environment variable from the outer shell: <code>fish_functions_path="$MY_FUNCTIONS_PATH" fish</code> but it seems environment variables don't affect those inner variables of fish.</p>  <p>Used this <a href="http://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a>.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
