<p>I made this nice batch that should add given path to system <code>%PATH%</code> on Windows:</p>  <pre><code>@echo off if exist %1\ (    setx PATH "%PATH%;%1" ) else (    echo %1 is NOT a folder    pause ) </code></pre>  <p>The <code>exist %1\</code> is a trick to check whether path is folder. I even made a nice context menu item for it:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nz3P2.png" alt="image description"></p>  <p>But the problem is it creates huge mess of repeated entries in system path. You might notice that I omitted <code>/M</code> parameter. That's on purpose, I want to configure <strong>user's system path</strong> only. That said I suppose I also need to be able to obtain that path specifically. At this moment I think it merges system and user path and does some additional mysterious mess.</p>
