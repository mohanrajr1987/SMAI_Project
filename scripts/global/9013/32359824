<p>In bash, I can pass an environment variable to a single command in the following way:</p>  <pre><code>KEY=VAL &lt;command&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However, I don't understand why the following doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>KEY=VAL echo $KEY </code></pre>  <p>While this works:</p>  <pre><code>KEY=VAL bash -c 'echo $KEY' </code></pre>  <p>i.e. the first one prints a blank line while the other prints "VAL". I'd expect both to print "VAL".</p>
