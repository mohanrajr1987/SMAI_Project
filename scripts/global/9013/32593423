<p>I am trying to execute this shell command in bash script 'test.sh'</p>  <pre><code>igblastn -query input.txt 2&gt;&amp;1 </code></pre>  <p>in a php file like this</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php    $string = "./test.sh";    $output = shell_exec($string);    echo "&lt;pre&gt;$output&lt;/pre&gt;; </code></pre>  <p>and I keep getting the error</p>  <pre><code>./test.sh: line 2: igblastn: command not found </code></pre>  <p>But when i use more basic commands like 'date' or 'whoami', it outputs just fine. This leads me to believe that either the permissions for the apache web usr 'www-data' need to be configured or I am not pathing correctly to the igblastn executable. I get the error still if I go and test making www-data a superuser for the web server so I don't think it is a problem with permissions and is a problem with pathing. The documentation for the NCBI standalone blast dictates an appendage to the $PATH variable and an introduction of another env variable to the database files in the same folder as the executable file. Currently, I have added the path location to the bin where the executable file is stored as an addition to the PATH variable in /etc/environment on my web server and added the other environment variable and I have also tried adding the another Environment variable to /etc/apache2/envvars but I am still unable to execute. Thus I am wondering if anyone knows definitively where I should create additional environment variables or specify paths for Apache? </p>
