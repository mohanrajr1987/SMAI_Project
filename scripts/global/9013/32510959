<p><code>.env</code> contains variables that show up when I check in my shell.  Ex:</p>  <pre><code>echo $VAR postgresql://... </code></pre>  <p>However, they are not recognized in ipython.  EX:</p>  <pre><code>In [1]: !echo $VAR In [2]:  </code></pre>  <p>This has happened before and I was able to run a command to force ipython to recognize my <code>.env</code> file, but I don't have that command handy.  Does anyone know how to make this work?</p>
