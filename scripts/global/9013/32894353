<p>I have a strange situation where I'm using zsh full-time, and any bash scripts I run are not picking environment variables properly. Obviously I don't expect bash to pick up env vars that are defined in zsh's environment, so I <em>am</em> using <code>~/.bashrc</code> and <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, but that doesn't work either.</p>  <p>For example, here's a test script:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  echo $MYTEST </code></pre>  <p>I've added this line to both <code>~/.bashrc</code> and <code>~/.bash_profile</code> to cover my bases:</p>  <pre><code>export MYTEST="hello" </code></pre>  <p>I just get a blank line when running the script.</p>  <p>PS: I know running <code>. ./testscript</code> will work, but that's not an option since it's a system-wide script that's failing to pull env vars.</p>
