<p>Is there a possibility to let Docker share the environment variables of containers that are linked with <code>--volumes-from</code> at runtime, the same way it does with containers linked with <code>--link</code>? </p>  <p>I'm using data-only containers for persistent data in my applications and I would like to check in the entrypoint script of my application container whether or not a data container was referenced at runtime and cancel if there is none.<br>  My idea was checking whether or not the environment variable of the data container (containing the path of the exposed volume) was set, I was also planning on using its value at certain points in the script (e.g. setting the data directory of my application in its configuration files).</p>  <p>Is there any way to achieve this and if not what would be the next best way to do the things I described?</p>  <hr>  <p>I found that <code>docker inspect</code> returns all <code>volumes-from</code> containers under <code>HostConfig.VolumesFrom</code>. This does not completely solve the sharing problem since I would like to check for a fixed value (the environment variable's name) and not a container name and need the variable's value as well, but it's a start.</p>
