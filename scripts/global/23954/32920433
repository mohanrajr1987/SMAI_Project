<p>I have created a broadcast receiver to listen for connectivity change events. Receiver works perfectly when I minimize the app using home button. But when I use back button to exit the app broadcast receiver stops listening for connectivity changes. I searched for it and found that I should call broadcast receiver from a service but that too is not working on app close. Here is my code for broadcast receiver with service.</p>  <p>Internet Service</p>  <pre><code> public class InternetService extends Service {      NetworkChangeReceiver networkChangeReceiver;      public InternetService() {         super();     }      @Override     public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {         IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(ConnectivityManager.CONNECTIVITY_ACTION);         networkChangeReceiver = new NetworkChangeReceiver();         registerReceiver(networkChangeReceiver, filter);         return Service.START_STICKY;     }      @Nullable     @Override     public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {         return null;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Broadcast receiver</p>  <pre><code>public class NetworkChangeReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {     boolean isConnected = false;      @Override     public void onReceive(final Context context, final Intent intent) {         isNetworkAvailable(context);      }       private boolean isNetworkAvailable(Context context) {         ConnectivityManager connectivity = (ConnectivityManager)                 context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);         if (connectivity != null) {             NetworkInfo info = connectivity.getActiveNetworkInfo();             if (info != null) {                 if (info.isConnected()) {                     if (!isConnected) {                         isConnected = true;                         Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), "Connected to internet", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();                         Log.v("Internet", "Internet Connected");                         hitDataService();                         Intent intent = new Intent(ActivityForm.this, MyService.class);                         startService(intent);                     }                     return true;                 }             }         }         isConnected = false;         return false;     } } </code></pre>  <p>I want to send some data to service even on app close and when mobile is connected to internet. Is there any other way of getting same behaviour.</p>
