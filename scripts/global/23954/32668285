<p>I have a navigation drawer where these many options are present</p>  <ul> <li>Image material</li> <li>Video Material</li> <li>Audio Material</li> </ul>  <p>We are maintaining separate fragment for each material and every fragment have grid view in which we are populating thumbnail of that material. Once user click on the thumbnail a full material will be downloaded(Using AsyncTask). I am displaying the progress bar over the thumbnail while downloading the full material.</p>  <p>Now here i stuck to a problem that suppose progress bar is showing 20% and i switched the fragment to another and again came back to the same and the downloading progress bar is lost.</p>  <p>I went to a solution to use intent service and broadcast receiver to populate the progress bar but in that case on every added bytes a broadcasting will be done is it a good practice ?</p>
