<p>I found many questions those are describing how to get the call state of a phone call using telephonymanager .And I was following this question in stackoverflow - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9684866/how-to-detect-when-phone-is-answered-or-rejected">How to detect when phone is answered or rejected</a>. But this is to detect the various phone states separately. <strong>I need to add a alert dialog only when a incoming call hang up with out answered.</strong> How to detect this particular event.? </p>
