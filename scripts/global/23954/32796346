<p>I have searched all over internet but not found much help there. I am making an alarm application in which i am using pending intents with alarm  manager. I want to set two alarms based  on specific id of the sqlite database table. For the first alarm I  am setting pending intent request code as positive id, and for  the second intent I am setting pending intent request  code as negative id (-1 * id). Here is the code</p>  <pre><code>PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, _id, i, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);  PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, -1 *_id, i, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT); </code></pre>  <p>Can _id  be negative?</p>
