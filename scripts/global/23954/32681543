<p>my C2DMBroadcastReceiver was working but it is not consist , when do onReceive is fired ? every time the applications start ? what could be a reason for onReceive not to be called ?</p>  <p>this is my manifest :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;receiver     android:name="my.package.C2DMBroadcastReceiver"     android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND"&gt;      &lt;!-- Receive the actual message --&gt;     &lt;intent-filter&gt;         &lt;action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" /&gt;         &lt;category android:name="my.package" /&gt;     &lt;/intent-filter&gt;     &lt;!-- Receive the registration id --&gt;     &lt;intent-filter&gt;         &lt;action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION" /&gt;         &lt;category android:name="my.package" /&gt;     &lt;/intent-filter&gt; &lt;/receiver&gt; </code></pre>  <p>am i missing something ? of course i have the my.package.C2DMBroadcastReceiver class which as i wrote was working but i can understand how to check this , what can be the issues i need to check if onReceive not fired ?</p>
