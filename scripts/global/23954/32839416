<p>I"m working on existing application and they are using EventBus that get every network exception like this :</p>  <pre><code>  public void onEvent(final NetworkErrorEvent event) {     runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {          @Override         public void run() {              Log.e("EventBus Event" + "(IOException)");              if (event.getType() == NetworkError.Timeout) {                 L.e("timeout");             } else if (event.getType() == NetworkError.Disconnected) {                 L.e("disconnected");             } else if (event.getType() == NetworkError.UnknownHost) {                 L.e("UnknownHost");             }               showConnectionErrorDialog(event.getType(), true);         }     }); } </code></pre>  <p>i want to add api call that i don't want to notify EventBus if failed , how it can be done ?</p>  <p>i don't see eventBus.post(event) in my project , the code i wrote is capture every network error even if i don't want him to .</p>
