<p>in my App, when I want to receive some notification about the bluetooth state, I register for a specific action in a specific section in the code and then listen to onReceive().</p>  <p>but the problem is, for an example, if i started discovering neigbouring devices using .StartDiscovery(), and before the discovery finishes i tried to bond "pair" to another device, in such case two actions will interfere and i think one will cancel the other.</p>  <p>so my question is, is there any way to avoid interference of two actions or to know in advance if an ation is currently running?</p>
