<p>I am trying to create a SpeechRecognizer within a Broadcast receiver that is attached a calling events on my android phone. Whenever a call is placed the broadcast receiver starts running and I receive a context as a parameter of onReceive(..). I then try to create a SpeechRecognizer which requires the current context as input.</p>  <pre><code>public class PhonecallReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {      public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent){          SpeechRecognizer recognizer = SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(context);      } } </code></pre>  <p>Since I want this recognizer to run when calls are being placed, I do not to keep an activity (disturbing the user) running and pass it's context to PhoneCallReceiver.</p>  <p>This does not work (app collapses), and I know for a fact that this works when I have another activity run and send its context to this class.</p>  <p>Questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Why doesn't it work? since I AM sending a context to SpeechRecognizer.</p></li> <li><p>Is there a way to pass some invisible context, that the user will not know ever existed?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks</p>
