<p>In my app, I have the following in my manifest:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;supports-screens android:smallScreens="false"                   android:normalScreens="true"                   android:largeScreens="true"                   android:xlargeScreens="true"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now, in my Resource Bucket folders, (XHDPI, HDPI, MDPI &amp; LDPI) I have provided copies of all the graphic resources scaled accordingly.</p>  <p>My question is, going on what I have, do I <em>need</em> to provide any resources in LDPI?  I mean, as I'm not supporting <em>small screens</em>, does it follow that I no longer need to provide LDPI resources or are there medium screens out there that could still look to the LDPI bucket?</p>  <p>I'm asking because if I don't need these, I'd rather remove them as they're pushing my APK size up.</p>
