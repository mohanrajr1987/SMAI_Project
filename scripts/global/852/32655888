<p>I have a php blogging website that using on shared hosting. There are few php files that i dont recognize that keep re-appearing and using all of my resources. I could not terminate it, but even i could terminate it (by contacting hosting support), it will reappear again and using all my resources again. I contacted hosting support and they said it might be caused by my script, my php script might generate these files while running it. But i do not think so since it did not happen before; it have been happening a week ago after i moved to better shared hosting. So i think these files are spam fold that someone keep inject into my hosting server, but im not sure.</p>  <p>Below are all the names of php files, if anyone has same problem or recognize these files, please give me some information and suggestion some solutions to stop this problem.</p>  <p>phpmyluph.php</p>  <p>perlmyluph.php</p>  <p>index.jpg.php</p>  <p>index3.php</p>  <p>baby.php</p>  <p>.htaccess (that is in temp foler and having codes relating to the files above)</p>  <p>.part (that is in temp foler and having codes relating to the files above)</p>  <p><strong>Thank you so much, i am very appreciated</strong></p>
