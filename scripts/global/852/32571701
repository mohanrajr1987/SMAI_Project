<p><a href="http://s3.postimg.org/y8iueoh0z/file.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s3.postimg.org/y8iueoh0z/file.jpg</a></p>  <p>When a user hits my web service, I want to return an html page. The html page is in the same folder as my landing page. I have tried a lot of different permutations on the file path using .getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("assetToken.html"); but they are always null. I feel like the command is right but it just doesn't see the file. If I load the file using File and absolute path, the html page returns, but I get a bunch of 404s on not being able to load the dependencies of the html file(a few angular stuff).</p>  <p>From my photo I am trying to load the circled photo in my rest service(jersey). I am not too familiar with class path/ build path, but from my picture I can see the file I want to load is under deployed resources, which I assume is the class path or something? </p>
