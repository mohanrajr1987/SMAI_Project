<p>I am looking for a Java BLE API, that will run on desktop, not mobile / Android.</p>  <p>I want to have my PC connect to a Panasonic PAN 1740 BluetoothLE chip located in some hardware I have.</p>  <p>However, I haven't been able to find any resources or examples to show me which API I should use or how I should use them.</p>  <p>Instead of Java, I am also willing to use C#, I know Microsoft has some BLE drivers. However, I haven't been able to find any clear cut documentation on it.</p>  <p>All the examples I've found are surrounded in non-BLE code, so it's hard for me to decipher which is BLE code and which is not, especially since I've never done anything in BLE, though I have in Bluetooth Classic.</p>  <p>If you guys have any good resources such as, wiki, javadocs, videos, simple examples, or anything of the such. Can you please list it here.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
