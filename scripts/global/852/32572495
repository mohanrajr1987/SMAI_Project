<p>so this must have been asked before, but i could'nt find something useful, so sry.</p>  <p>Here is my scenario: I want to store Information about Items, their price and other values in an ArrayList. Lets say we have about 10.000 items in the list when we're done. My question is, what way is the fastet / what takes less resources for the system so that the app runs most efficient.</p>  <p>Should i: use one ArrayList for all the Data Like this</p>  <pre><code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); items.add("name;price;from");  String[] seperated = items.get(i).split(";"); seperated[0]... </code></pre>  <p>and then have to split it whenever i need to read from it. (will be each time a customer is searching an item, i could then only split the entries that fit the search criteria)</p>  <p>or should i use 3 ArrayLists with 10.000 Items each.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
