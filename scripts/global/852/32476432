<p>I would like to know if mesosphere DCOS can be configured for mutliple customers, so that a customer can use for example at max 10 CPU, 10GB RAM and 1TB Storage or something like this? I would define as prerequisity that each customer can make use of the installed API packages like kubernetes to handle containers, applications etc. and that a command there would fail if the resources are not reserved for the customer. If not currently supported, is there some plan to do so or is there another way to archive this?</p>  <p>Thanks for your engagement and answers!</p>
