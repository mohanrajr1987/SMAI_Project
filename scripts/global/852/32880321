<p>Read multiple message resources having same/different name, under different packages, in a jar in on go?</p>  <p>let's suppose my jar xyz.jar structure is as follow: project structure:</p>  <pre><code>src|main|resources               |pkg1|message1.properties               |pkg2|message2.properties               ...               |pkg3|message1.properties </code></pre>  <p>These resources under different packages are being generated dynamically through maven goals. What I want here, load all resource bundles and maintain at single place along with package name. I don't want to hard code these packages in my code, even don't want to change my code when new files are being added dynamically. Any help, much appreciated! Thanks</p>
