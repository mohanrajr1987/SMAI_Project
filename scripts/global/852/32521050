<p>I am using the  Jazzy spell Check API in my project for providing suggestions for misspelled words. I have a .dic file which has all the correct English words, however I am unable to comprehend why my .dic file has words in random oder and not in alphabetical order. ? Also the dictionary that i am currently using has lot of slang words, So should I remove the slang words(which feels like a very tough job), or use a new .dic file which has no slang words in it.? If i should use a new one could you please suggest me such a Dictionary?</p>
