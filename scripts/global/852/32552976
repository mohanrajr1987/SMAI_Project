<p>I'm using XAMPP (5.6.12) with PHP version 5.6.12 and Apache 2.4.16 (Win32) on Windows 8.1.</p>  <p>I have a DYNAMIC domain, where the main code of my site resides, and a STATIC domain for serving static content. I have each configured and running on my local and live servers. </p>  <p>On the local server, to access content on the STATIC domain from the DYNAMIC domain, I merely prefix the content URL with //STATIC/, like this:</p>  <p>//STATIC/IMAGES/MY.JPG</p>  <p>This works. However, it does not work if the content is being passed to a PHP function, like getimagesize(). In those case, I have to provide the local path on my computer to that resource, not the domain path.</p>  <p>In other words, to display an image in HTML on my local DYNAMIC domain, I'd have to reference it this way:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;img style="display: inline;" src="//STATIC/IMAGES/MY.JPG" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However, to pass the same resource to a PHP function on my local DYNAMIC domain, I have to provide its location on my computer, thus:</p>  <pre><code>getimagesize('C:/XAMPP/HTDOCS/STATIC/IMAGES/MY.JPG'); </code></pre>  <p>I had hoped to define a single variable that would toggle depending on whether the code was on the live server or on my local server (like $static_content_url = "//STATIC/" when on the local server and $static_content_url = "<a href="http://static.com/" rel="nofollow">http://static.com/</a>" when it is on the live server, something I can detect and modify with PHP code) so that I could use $static_content_url throughout my code, but it seems I need two different resource paths.</p>  <p>Or do I?</p>
