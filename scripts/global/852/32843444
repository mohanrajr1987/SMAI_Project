<p>I've been using resource files without any problems till now.  The problem is that I'm not sure whether I can create resource files for non-existent cultures or which alternative to use in this case.</p>  <p>My website works as a store for multiple countries, each one having specific content. When we select /pt would be for portugal, /es for spain etc. For them, I use respectively the cultures pt-PT and es-ES.</p>  <p>But how can I use resource files if I want a portuguese store but with a page translated to english, since en-PT culture does not exist? </p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
