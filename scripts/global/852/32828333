<p>After upgrading our SharePoint servers from 2010 -> 2013 some code that used to be working is no longer working. My suspicion is that it's not the script that's the problem, but the resources being invoked by it:</p>  <pre><code>    soapEnv ="&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' " + "xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema' "+   "xmlns:soap='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'&gt;"+ "&lt;soap:Body&gt;"+     "&lt;GetListItems xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/sharepoint/soap/'&gt;"+ </code></pre>  <p>The bottom link brings me to a page that says "The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable." Does anyone know where this resource has been moved to, or if the ones from 2001 are even still usable?</p>
