<p>The program below is supposed to get a resource string from a satellite resourcefile. It works fine when compiled with target framework='NET Framework 4.5.2' using VS2015. However, setting target framework='NET Framework 3.5' makes it unable to find the satellite resource file and fall back to the default resources.</p>  <p>I peeked in the .exe and satellite .dll files and found that they are compiled to different .net versions (Eventhough it was the same compilation that generated them):</p>  <pre><code>Main exe got:                  .Net Framework v3.5 Satellite resource dll got:    .Net Framework v4.0  </code></pre>  <p>It seams like the satellite dlls gets the wrong .Net version. Has anyone experienced this and is there a solution? (Other than upgrading the project to the newest .Net version) </p>  <pre><code>class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {          CultureInfo newCultureInfo = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("da-DK");         Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = newCultureInfo;          Console.WriteLine("Resource test");         ResourceManager rm = new ResourceManager("ResourceTest.Resources.MyResources", Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());          Console.WriteLine(rm.GetString("hello"));          Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");         Console.ReadKey();     } } </code></pre>  <p>EDIT: Seams like I got a bad update to my development enviroment. A reinstall of the whole computer helped, but simply reinstalling .Net and Visual Studio didn't! (I wonder if there is something in the registry database that doesn't get reset by a simple reinstall)</p>
