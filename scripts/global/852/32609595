<p>When I install my app on my main/new phone, the installed size is around 18.5MB  and when I install my app on an old Samsung Galaxy Ace (Mk1), for some reason, it installs with pretty much the same size, as you see here:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dCsCb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dCsCb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It runs perfectly on my main phone, but obviously, the old Galaxy Ace really struggles with it.</p>  <p>Now, I download a random game from the Play Store and with that one you can see the results here:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ECZt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ECZt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Much better, it takes up less space on the less capable phone than it does on the more capable phone.</p>  <p>However, my question is, where can I start to try to figure out why my app <em>doesn't</em> exhibit this desired behaviour?</p>  <p><strong>Information about my project</strong></p>  <p>I have provided 4 sets of Graphics within my project and they are:</p>  <p><em>Graphics</em></p>  <ul> <li>XHDPI: Total of 3.73MB</li> <li>HDPI:  Total of 2.87MB</li> <li>MDPI:  Total of 1.33MB</li> <li>LDPI:  Total of 1.03MB</li> </ul>  <p><em>Sound</em></p>  <ul> <li>OGG Sound Files: 202KB</li> <li>MP3 Soundtrack:  5.6MB</li> </ul>  <p>The (Unsigned and signed) APK file is about 16.02MB</p>  <p>Apart from that there is a classes.dex file within the APK which is about 3.5MB.</p>  <p>In Eclipse, I link BaseGameUtils and Google-play-service-lib jar files.</p>  <p>I know that my game is slightly more resource hungry than the other game I downloaded - but that isn't the point of this question.  I need to make sure that the size of the installed app is smaller on lesser capable phones than it is 'better' ones but as you can see, mine is <em>exactly</em> the same.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>Additional information if it helps:</p>  <p>The Samsung Galaxy Ace is running Android <strong>2.3.4 Gingerbread</strong></p>  <p>The other phone is running Android <strong>4.4.2 Kit Kat</strong></p>
