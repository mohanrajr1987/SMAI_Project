<p><strong>A little background:</strong> <br> My program was used to support normal File System, reading Excel file (and do some action with the data) with ExcelDataContext. It was fine for all the action.</p>  <p><strong>Now:</strong><br> My program has to be modify to support and work together with Hadoop Oozie. Using <strong>Metamodel-hadoop 4.3.5 version</strong>, I manage to read the excel file from hadoop using <strong>HdfsResource</strong>. ExcelDataContext able to support <strong>Resource</strong> and it is fine to do the same job as before.</p>  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br> However, my oozie job workflow was not able to end/complate even after my program has finish running. After a few hours of debugging, I found out it was the issue of using HdfsResource to init ExcelDataContext.</p>  <p>Here is how I define <strong>HdfsResource</strong>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>...<br>   Resource hdfsResource = new HdfsResource(hdfsExcelFilePath);<br>   ExcelDataContext dc = new ExcelDataContext(hdfsResource, excelConfiguration);<br>   ....</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I comment out the hdfsResource line and use local file system, the program is able to complete / end the process without problem.</p>  <p>I suspect the resource was not close / end properly, but I was not able to close / end it even if I set it to NULL. Is there anyway to solve this? There are no close function.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>hdfsResource = null;</p> </blockquote>
