<p>I'm having problems with my mobile app because when I request to my server a image, and it doesn't exits server returns another image with similar name. For example the app is requesting /image/image_00602.png and it doesn't exist, server return /image/image_00002.png because it exists.</p>  <p>I don't know how to resolve it, because my app is showing wrong pictures when it should inform about "File not found"</p>  <p>Thank you very much. </p>
