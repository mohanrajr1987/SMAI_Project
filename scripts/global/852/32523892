<p>I have this files structure for a Java module of an Android project on Android Studio:</p>  <pre><code>src   +  main        +  java             + (several folders and source files)        +  resources             + nad                 + (several text files) </code></pre>  <p>The issue is that <code>nad</code> folder is not being copied into <code>target/classes/</code> folder when I build the project in Android Studio. <code>nad</code> folder is marked as <code>resource</code> on: <code>Project Structure</code> window -> <code>Modules</code> -> <code>Sources</code></p>  <p>I have other similar project which is correctly copying the <code>nad</code> folder into <code>target</code>.</p>  <p>I can't find out which configuration option I must use. Any idea?</p>
