<p>My project contains audio resources that are in the path <code>src/res/sounds</code> under the project root. When I've been working on it in Eclipse, running would work because the project root would be the working directory.</p>  <p>However I exported the project into a runnable JAR file and tried to run it <code>java -jar</code> from the command line. I got <code>The system cannot file the file specified</code> errors since the working directory was now the one where I was running the command line from, and the relative path of the resources was no longer valid.</p>  <p>What is the correct way to work with external resources in my code (which will be later packaged in the JAR)? And how can I fix my current issue?</p>
