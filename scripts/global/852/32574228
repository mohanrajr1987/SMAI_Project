<p>I'm trying to work on a new project in Android Studio, and it's a NEW project because every time I try to run any app, at some point, the app will crash, and the debugger will show that there are "symbols" that it cannot resolve or find origins of in utility classes such as Resources and Context and BaseBundle (I don't even know what this class does) and oh so many more.</p>  <p>I'm trying to get extra content from and Intent</p>  <pre><code>Bundle extras = data.getExtras(); Bitmap photo = (Bitmap) extras.get("data"); </code></pre>  <p>And here's when it crashes. At the <code>get("data")</code></p>  <p><code>Build --&gt; Clean Project</code> and <code>Build --&gt; Rebuild Project</code> didn't help.</p>  <p><code>File --&gt; Invalidate Caches</code> didn't help...</p>  <p>Starting a new project didn't help either...</p>  <p>Please Help </p>
