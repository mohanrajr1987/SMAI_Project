<p>I am trying to build x86_64 windows executable. It has some resources that need to be compiled with windres. However, it genrates i386 object file from given resources which consequently fails to link with the rest.</p>  <p>Checking windres --help gives me:</p>  <pre><code>windres: supported targets: pe-i386 pei-i386 elf32-i386 elf32-little elf32-big s rec symbolsrec verilog tekhex binary ihex </code></pre>  <p>I may be wrong, but it seems that it means my version of windres cannot build x86_64 objects at all.</p>  <p>What can i do to fix my problem?</p>  <p>The system i am "on" is 32-bit Msys shell with x86_64 MinGw. If possible, i would like to get an appropriate version of windres, capable of building x86_64 object files - building ot from source is possible, bu i failed to find the source.</p>
