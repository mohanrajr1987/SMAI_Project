<p><em>Please note the URLS contained in the post aren't real - just examples</em></p>  <p>Is it possible to check what dataset/s a resource sits in via a single api query? </p>  <p>It seems possible to do via a 3 step query such as:</p>  <ol> <li>Get revision ID: <a href="http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/resource_search?query=url:https://www.example.com/resources/datafile.csv" rel="nofollow">http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/resource_search?query=url:https://www.example.com/resources/datafile.csv</a> </li> <li>Get package ID: <a href="http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/revision_show?id=de5707gg-5568-1291-83df-7a6e2a441396" rel="nofollow">http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/revision_show?id=de5707gg-5568-1291-83df-7a6e2a441396</a> </li> <li>Get containing dataset: <a href="http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=de5707gg-5568-1291-83df-7a6e2a441396" rel="nofollow">http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=de5707gg-5568-1291-83df-7a6e2a441396</a> </li> </ol>  <p>Alternatively I've been able to use:  <a href="https://demo.ckan.org/api/action/package_search" rel="nofollow">https://demo.ckan.org/api/action/package_search</a>  This allows me to get all packages and info contained within then use javascript on a page to process the results, this gives me the dataset/s if any are applicable.</p>  <p>However I'm curious if this can be done in a single API call as opposed to doing multiple or having to rely on something outside of CKAN to process (ie without using Javascript as in second example).</p>  <p>I thought it might have been possible to do something like:  <a href="https://data.qld.gov.au/api/action/package_search?q=de5707gg-5568-1291-83df-7a6e2a441396" rel="nofollow">https://data.qld.gov.au/api/action/package_search?q=de5707gg-5568-1291-83df-7a6e2a441396</a>  but it does not seem to search ID fields? I'd prefer to search by URL as I wouldn't necessarily know what the ID is to begin with unfortunately and the package search doesn't have this content to search across.</p>
