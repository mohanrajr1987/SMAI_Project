<p>I have a website I have been working on that works just fine locally but when deployed to gh-pages has many 404's when trying to pull in resources. For example, I have a line of css for the background which is</p>  <pre><code>background: #fff url(/assets/images/bg.jpg) repeat top left; </code></pre>  <p>the 404 I get is this{</p>  <pre><code>github.io/assets/images/bg.jpg </code></pre>  <p>The path should be</p>  <pre><code>github.io/myProject/assets/images/bg.jpg </code></pre>  <p>How can I change this to work?</p>
