<p>I started doing some research on the framework for Garry's Mod addons and I am very confused by the documentation presented <a href="http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'm just looking for a step in the right direction. I already have a firm grasp of Lua so that shouldn't be an issue.</p>  <p>As well as that, to avoid this question sounding too vague, I'll present a problem I'm having currently.</p>  <p>I stumbled across <a href="http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/GM/KeyPress" rel="nofollow">this</a> function. I created a .lua file containing the example code, placed it in the appropriate directory, and attempted to execute it on my server. The file ran without any errors but did not function as expected.</p>
