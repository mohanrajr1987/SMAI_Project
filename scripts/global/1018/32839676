<p>Lua classes can be created using the OO system that Luabind exposes to Lua:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind/docs.html#defining-classes-in-lua" rel="nofollow">http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind/docs.html#defining-classes-in-lua</a></p>  <pre><code>class 'MyClass' function MyClass:__init()         self.a1 = true     self.a2 = "MyClass" end </code></pre>  <p>After creating the above class, if I want the attributes which I have added in Lua(i.e. a1 and a2), I do the following:</p>  <pre><code>obj = MyClass()  info = class_info(obj) print("Methods:") for k,v in pairs(info.methods) do      print(k .. ': ' .. tostring(v)) end  print("Attributes:") for k,v in pairs(info.attributes) do      print(k .. ': ' .. tostring(v)) end </code></pre>  <p>But I see only __init and no attributes. Is there a way to get the attributes a1 &amp; a2?</p>  <p>I have stepped through get_class_info() while debugging (see <a href="https://github.com/luabind/luabind/blob/master/src/class_info.cpp#L33" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/luabind/luabind/blob/master/src/class_info.cpp#L33</a>)</p>  <p>But that function does not seem to iterate more than once before exiting. Does anyone know the object format which is used by luabind? Or how I can extract these attributes?</p>  <p>Note: If I create a class in C++ and expose it through Luabind, then I do see any attributes that I exposed from C++. Its the attributes in Lua which are the issue.</p>
