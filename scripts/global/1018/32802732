<p>I have a table:</p>  <pre><code>employee = {              name = "John", age = 30,              name = "George", age = 35            } </code></pre>  <p>Now, I want to run the whole table, and if the name "George" is found, then the appropriate age to be printed. How can I do this? From what I searched I found that you can run a list with the code <code>for k, v in pairs(employee) do</code> but I don't know how to continue from there.</p>
