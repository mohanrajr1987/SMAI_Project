<p>I'm looking for amount of repetitions of symbols in Lua pattern setup. I try to check amount of symbols in a string. As I read in <a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/PatternsTutorial" rel="nofollow">manual</a>,  Even with character classes this is still very limiting, because we can only match strings with a fixed length. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>To solve this, patterns support these four repetition operators:</p>      <ul>   <li>'*' Match the previous character (or class) zero or more times, as many times as possible.</li>   <li>'+' Match the previous character (or class) one or more times, as many times as possible.</li>   <li>'-' Match the previous character (or class) zero or more times, as few times as possible.</li>   <li>'?' Make the previous character (or class) optional.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>So, no information about Braces <code>{}</code> e.g.,</p>  <pre><code>{1,10}; {1,}; {10}; </code></pre>  <p>doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>local np = '1' local a =  np:match('^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1}$' ) </code></pre>  <p>returns <code>np = nil</code>.</p>  <pre><code>local np = '1{1}' local a =  np:match('^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1}$' ) </code></pre>  <p>returns <code>np = '1{1}'</code> :)</p>  <p>This <a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html" rel="nofollow">url</a> says that no such magic symbols:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Some characters, called magic characters, have special meanings when   used in a pattern. The magic characters are</p>  <pre><code>( ) . % + - * ? [ ^ $ </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>Curly brackets do work only as simple text and no more. Am I right? What is the best way to avoid this 'bug'?</p>  <p>It is possible to read usual usage of braces, for instance, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3032751/1979882">here</a>.</p>
