<p>How can I get variables that not declared yet?</p>  <p>Here are simple example:</p>  <pre><code>a = b b = 123 </code></pre>  <p>What I want from these 2 lines is <code>a</code> &lt;&lt; <code>123</code>. But obv it doesn't work.</p>  <p>I know the easy way to get the answer <code>a = 123</code> is cut 1st line and paste it to lower than 2nd line.</p>  <p>But I'm in some problem. I need some function like 'WillDeclaredVar()' that I can use in like this:</p>  <pre><code>a = WillDeclaredVar(b) sheepCount = 123 b = sheepCount print(a) </code></pre>  <p>so I can get the answer '123'.</p>  <p>Or there are any built-in functions that will allows me to do similar thing?</p>  <p>===</p>  <p>I think the link given by timrau is not telling my case. the key point is how to get Variables 'that not declared yet'.</p>
