<p>I'm needing some explanation for an assignement. </p>  <p>I'm modeling a ontology for restaurants. The classes relevant to this question are <code>dishes</code> and <code>Restaurant</code>. </p>  <p>The class <code>dishes</code> contain subclasses with the sort of dishes they serve. So for example <code>class(dishes) has subclass(italian)</code>. To the subclass <code>italian</code> I've added instances like <code>spaghetti</code>. </p>  <p>The class restaurant contains mostly subclasses with necessary and sufficient restrictions to describe the type of restaurants based on the dishes they serve. But before a restaurant can get categorised I've got create instances with named restaurants. Take for example instance(pizzaFreddi) which is linked to the instance pizza through a property hasDish. Because the instance Pizza belongs to italian the restriction on one of the defined subclasses of restaurant (with ItalianDishes) infers this instance. This one works, I've used a some restriction. But what I want to do is also create a defined subclass that infers instances(namedRestaurants) that have for example more than one location. The instance <code>PizzaFreddi</code> for example is linked with a property isLocatedIn to the city <code>Amsterdam</code> and <code>Den Haag</code>. I've made a restriction that says: isLocatedIn min 2 City. But this does not seem to infer the instance <code>PizzaFreddi</code>. What's going wrong?</p>  <p>I've added screenshots for explanation. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8sYNV.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/8sYNV.png</a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z8rT6.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/z8rT6.png</a></p>
