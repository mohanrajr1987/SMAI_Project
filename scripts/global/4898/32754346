<p>So a method takes any object adds a child node to a tree view for every public object reference in the given object. It then does the same for each of those references (assuming that they are not null) and so on and so forth until the entire structure is mapped out and labled.</p>  <p>clicking on any node in the tree then displays the appropriate object in a property grid.</p>  <p>Can you do that?</p>  <p>how?</p>
