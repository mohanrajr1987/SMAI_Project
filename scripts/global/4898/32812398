<p>I use 2 forms that communicate between each other. When the first form is updated, he gives some invoice numbers to the other form which displays the invoices. But when that form is already open, nothing happens then. The second form has a public property where I push the invoice id's in. But somehow he won't update the checkboxes and the data is not diplayed.  I have looked at the MSDN library but it still doesn't want to work.. Or what am I missing here... </p>  <pre><code> Implements INotifyPropertyChanged Private InvoiceID As String 'Invoices seperated with : (1000:1001:1002) Public Property GetInvoiceIDs() As String     Get         Return InvoiceID     End Get     Set(ByVal value As String)         InvoiceID = value         NotifyPropertyChanged()     End Set End Property </code></pre>  <p>Public Event PropertyChanged As PropertyChangedEventHandler Implements INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged</p>  <pre><code>Protected Sub NotifyPropertyChanged()     RaiseEvent PropertyChanged(Me, New PropertyChangedEventArgs(GetInvoiceIDs))     ChkCompany.Checked = False     ChkCompany.CheckState = CheckState.Unchecked     ChkCustomerID.Checked = False     ChkCustomerID.CheckState = CheckState.Unchecked     ChkCustomerName.Checked = False     ChkCustomerName.CheckState = CheckState.Unchecked     ChkDatum.Checked = False     ChkDatum.CheckState = CheckState.Unchecked     ChkFreeSearch.Checked = False     ChkFreeSearch.CheckState = CheckState.Unchecked     ChkInvoice.Checked = False     ChkInvoice.CheckState = CheckState.Unchecked     LoadData(InvoiceID) End Sub </code></pre>
