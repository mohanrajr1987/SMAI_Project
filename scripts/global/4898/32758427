<p>I'm currently developing an application which requires access to an API with credentials. I didn't want to put them hard coded in the application so I created a configuration.properties file for them.</p>  <p>At the moment this file is located in src/main/resources and access it with the following code.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;context:property-placeholder location="classpath:configuration.properties" ignore-unresolvable="true" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This means that if I change something in the configuration I need to redeploy the WAR.</p>  <p><strong>My question</strong> is: Where do I put this configuration file so that I don't need to redeploy in case of a change in the configuration?</p>  <p><em>I don't want to put it somewhere random on my computer so that I can share my code with other people without to much trouble with the file's location.</em></p>
