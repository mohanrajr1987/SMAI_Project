<p>I tried using <strong>PropertiesConfiguration</strong>, it help me what i wanted, but found an issue, if my property's value contains comma followed by a whitespace, after using <strong>PropertiesConfiguration</strong> for property update whitespace vanishes, can anyone try this or suggest me if any other method to edit property file without impacting its format</p>  <p>if anyone wish to try, you can set below property in a file and then using above code update property file, update other property instead of below property, let me know what is the outcome</p>  <pre><code>property=value1, value2 </code></pre>
