<p>I understand <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/api/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.html" rel="nofollow">org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration</a>  is used to load hadoop related configuration information from 'resource' (xml) files </p>  <p>And <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/PropertiesConfiguration.html" rel="nofollow">PropertiesConfiguration</a> is a 'classic' <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html" rel="nofollow">Properties</a> loader which can load from a .properties file.</p>  <p>Besides the apparent difference that one loads from a XML and other from a .properties or even YAML, I am trying to understand how similar/dissimilar they are. Is the hadoop configuration just a kind of PropertiesConfiguration, if so couldn't the makers of hadoop just use/extend PropertiesCnfiguration, especially since it appears more versatile.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
