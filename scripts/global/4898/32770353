<p>I currently have a maven release pipeline set up with multiple projects. I haven't been able to find a way to update dependency properties to the latest 'pretty' snapshot version after the <code>mvn release:perform</code>.</p>  <p>To clarify, here is the release pipeline:</p>  <p><code>Release Project A --&gt; Release Project B --&gt; Release Project C...</code></p>  <p>Project B pom.xml before release (pseudo pom):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;version&gt;1.2.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt; &lt;properties&gt;     &lt;project-a.version&gt;1.4.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/project-a.version&gt; &lt;/properties&gt; </code></pre>  <p>During the release process, <code>&lt;project-a.version&gt;</code> is automatically updated to the latest release version, which in this case would be <code>1.4.1</code>. </p>  <p>After the release, project B's pseudo pom looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;version&gt;1.2.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt; &lt;properties&gt;     &lt;project-a.version&gt;1.4.1&lt;/project-a.version&gt; &lt;properties&gt; </code></pre>  <p>For development and testing reasons, I would like the <code>&lt;project-a.version&gt;</code> to be set to <code>1.4.2-SNAPSHOT</code> after the release is performed, based on what the latest snapshot version is. </p>  <p>Using <code>mvn versions:update-properties -DallowSnapshots=true</code> kind of accomplishes this, but it leaves me with a very ugly snapshot version number and leaves me tied to a specific snapshot artifact: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;project-a.version&gt;3b2a0d174a0658de1d3bfc777c248f83a8286e61-SNAPSHOT&lt;/project-a.version&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there anyway to get the general, 'pretty' version number? I'm assuming probably not, since the 'pretty' snapshot version number doesn't refer to one specific artifact, which is technically not a good idea.</p>
