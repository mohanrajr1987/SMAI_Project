<p>I have a property in the model that I want to set one time when the view is loaded. It is a property that influences the view so it feels like it should be set in the view (as opposed to a default in the model). I don't want the end user to set the property, that is why it is not bound to a UI element. I want the view designer to set the value.</p>  <p>The viewmodel (that can get to the model) is set to the datacontext of usercontrol in the view. This seems like it should be straightforward but I have not been able to figure it out.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
