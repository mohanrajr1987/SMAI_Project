<p>I've the need to have some configuration file outside the WAR structure so I can update my service keeping the conf files unaffected. Searching around seems that the best solution is to use <code>classLoader.getResourceAsStream()</code> and set the conf file container folder in the <code>shared.loader</code> property of <code>catalina.properties</code>. Doing so the folder enter in the classpath.</p>  <p>I've made a test on a standalone tomcat server and everything works, but I'm not able to make it work in Eclipse IDE with the plugged server. I've edited the <code>catalina.properties</code> under Servers folder of Eclipse and added the conf folder under the installation directory of the plugged server. I ask the experts what am I doing wrong.</p>  <p>Sorry but I'm not able to read the .properties file as suggested. This is my try:</p>  <pre><code>   ClassLoader classLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();         Properties properties = new Properties();          properties.load(classLoader.getResourceAsStream("prop_folder/jpa.properties"));                  String propValue = properties.getProperty("test");            System.out.println("Property value is: " + propValue);           </code></pre>  <p>Seems that getResourceAsStream() didn't find any resource.</p>  <p>The prop_folder is under the root of the Eclipse plugged server</p>
