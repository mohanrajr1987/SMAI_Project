<p>I have searched high and low for some help regarding AutoCAD Link Templates.</p>  <p>I have managed to create a connection between AutoCAD and my SQL server. I am able to view the servers tables from AutoCAD. </p>  <p>My next task is to find a way to create a link between the properties of an Object in my drawing (eg. The text of a Label) to a row in my SQL table, To the point where I could change the value of that row in SQL, and it would change the text value of the object within my AutoCAD.</p>  <p>Like I said i am struggling to find sources of information or any help at all with achieving this. Which is why I am here now asking if anyone could give me and help or advice with how I would achieve this. </p>  <p>Anything is appreciated, thank you in advance.</p>
