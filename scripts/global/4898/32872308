<p>In Java Properties, can you use property substitutions in the property <strong><em>keys</em></strong> of the other property key names? </p>  <p>Something like this:</p>  <pre><code>between=Between and=and greater.than=Greaterthan ${between}1${and}4Units=1-4 ${between}5${and}8Units=5-8 ${between}9${and}20Units=9-20 ${between}21${and}50Units=21-50 ${between}51${and}99Units=51-99 ${greater.than}100Units=100-999 </code></pre>
