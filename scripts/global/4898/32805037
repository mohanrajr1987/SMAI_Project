<p>When I define the SQL query below as a PHP class property I get a parse error. If I instead define that same query inside one of the class methods, I get no error. Can someone please tell me how I can define this as a PHP class property correctly? Thank you.</p>  <p>I have other SQL queries defined as properties that work fine, but they do not contain any variables.</p>  <pre><code>private $querySelectDateId = " SELECT healthDateId FROM kidsDate WHERE healthDate = '$healthDate' "; </code></pre>
