<p>I am messing with properties-files in Java. I want to know if there are some properties-files that use empty values ('propertyName=\n') and what they are used for?</p>  <p>[Update]</p>  <p>Since some folks are still irritated here is a better description:</p>  <p>A sample properties file might look like:</p>  <pre><code>database.username = john database.password = johnsSecret </code></pre>  <p>Ok so its simple. Now the question is if someone have seen something like:</p>  <pre><code>anyProperty = </code></pre>  <p>I am just asking if you know a use case that actually happen where you needed to express an empty property value within a property file and why was it.</p>  <p>PS: This is no social experiment, it is to determine if this case is practical needed or if I can use it to express the desire to remove the property when specifying a delta to transform an existing properties file by adding or removing its entries. Alternatively I will use <code>-propertyname</code> to remove any property.</p>
