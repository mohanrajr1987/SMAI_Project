<p>I'm trying to use <a href="https://roslyn.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Language%20Feature%20Status" rel="nofollow">auto-property initializers</a>, like so:</p>  <pre><code>class Class1 {     public string Auth { get; set; } = "BlahBlah"; } </code></pre>  <p>However, when I build, I get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Invalid token '=' in class, struct, or interface member declaration</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is in Visual Studio 2013, using Target Framework .NET 4.6 (which is the version which introduced auto-property initializers).</p>  <p>Is there something wrong with my syntax?</p>
