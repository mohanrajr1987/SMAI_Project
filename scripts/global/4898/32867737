<p>All my junit tests are giving "missing resource for key " I have the path correctly pointed to the classes folder in windows/preferences/linked resources, when I search in the property file, the key entry is present, but when the junit test hits the code that accesses the key, it throws error of missing resource for key. I am wondering what is it that was working and stopped spotting a valid key entry in the properties file now.The properties path pointed is right one. Thanks. </p>
