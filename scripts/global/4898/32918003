<p>I am creating a user control which contains 2 ListView controls. I want the user to be able to use Designer to set the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controls--basically, the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controls are to be synced to each other, using the exact same ColumnHeader collections.</p>  <p>For the user control itself, in order for the Columns property to work properly as a collection of column headers, I find I must inherit from System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection. I set the collection class to Serializable and the class property to DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Content). When I do this, and use the user control on a form and add columns to the Columns property, I find in the form's Designer in InitializeComponents that the Add method of the collection class is used to add the ColumnHeader variables created. This works.</p>  <p>What I have trouble doing, however, is syncing the Columns collection property with the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls. For the inherited collection class (inherited from Collection), I cannot override the Add method, so I can't set the Add method to also add the ColumnHeader to the Columns properties of the 2 Listview controls.</p>  <p>How do I assure that the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls always change to match changes in the user control's Columns property?</p>
