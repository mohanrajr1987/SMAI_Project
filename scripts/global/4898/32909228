<p>Take the code below, is there an easier/better way to check for the existence of myProp3? Imagine that myProp1 and myProp2 also only exist if myProp3 exists. I have run into a few API's that do this and it's a bear to check for the existence of these sub properties down a long chain.</p>  <pre><code>var myObj = {     myProp1: {         myProp2: {             myProp3: 'myProp3'         }     } }  if (myObj.myProp1 &amp;&amp; myObj.myProp1.myProp2 &amp;&amp; myObj.myProp1.myProp2.myProp3 &amp;&amp; myObj.myProp1.myProp2.myProp3 == 'myProp3') {     //do something } </code></pre>
