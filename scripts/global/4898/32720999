<p>I learned today that when writing your own getter/setter methods, ivars aren't automatically synthesized in the getter: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13817562/property-not-working-with-getter-and-setter">property not working with getter AND setter</a></p>  <p>To get around this, I just set my property to be <code>nonatomic</code> and then only wrote the setter-- which allowed me to avoid writing <code>@synthesize property = _property</code></p>  <p>I know the main purpose for <code>nonatomic</code> properties is so the system can read/write the property faster because it doesn't concern itself with locking the property while writing</p>  <p>But as a side-effect (as it seems), you don't have to write both a setter and getter.</p>  <p>Is this bad?  I'm just not sure if there are other drawbacks I'm not seeing</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Adding code for clarity:</p>  <p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>  <pre><code>@interface GalleryManager () {    NSObject&lt;GalleryManagerDelegateProtocol&gt;* _delegate; }  ...  -(NSObject&lt;GalleryManagerDelegateProtocol&gt;*)delegate {    return _delegate; }  -(void)setDelegate:(NSObject&lt;GalleryManagerDelegateProtocol&gt; *)delegate {    [self stopObservingDelegate];    _delegate = delegate;    [self startObservingDelegate];     if ( delegate &amp;&amp; self.didWakeFromNib )    {       [self setupDefaults];       [self readGalleryFromDisk];    } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Header:</strong></p>  <p><code>@property (weak, nonatomic) NSObject&lt;GalleryManagerDelegateProtocol&gt; *delegate; </code></p>  <p>I wanted to remove the instance variable defined in the extension (<code>_delegate</code>), for no reason other than I didn't think it was necessary </p>  <p>But by doing so, the <code>-delegate</code> getter method broke, unable to recognize <code>_delegate</code>.  Because I had the <code>@property</code> in the header, I thought the <code>_delegate</code> ivar would be automatically synthesized, but as I have found it is only recognized in the setter.</p>  <p>So in that SO question I linked at the beginning, the answer was to add <code>@synthesize delegate = delegate</code> at the beginning of the implementation</p>  <p>But instead I wanted to just change the <code>@property</code> in the header to be <code>nonatomic</code>, and then just straight up delete the <code>-delegate</code> getter method</p>  <p>Again, for no other reason than to be as clean as possible</p>
