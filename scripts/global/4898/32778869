<p>I've created 32 properties.settings type of int32[,].  I will use them during runtime-read and write some data and check every settings values with foreach command. i get some problems iterating through properties values. Here is my code: </p>  <pre><code> private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  {      foreach (SettingsProperty c in Properties.Settings.Default.Properties)      {          if (c[0,0]==0)     // i can not reach this byte :(          {                 c[0, 0] = 1;   // :((          }      } } </code></pre>
