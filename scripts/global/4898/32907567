<p>The following code doesn't appear to work, and yet I'm sure it used to.</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String args[]) {     Properties currentProperties = System.getProperties();     Properties p = new Properties(currentProperties);     System.setProperties(p); } </code></pre>  <p>During the construction of the new Properties object the old properties are not added, so when System.setProperties is called it has the effect of wiping all of the system properties.</p>  <p>What's also odd is there is an example of code similar to this on the Oracle website.</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html</a></p>  <p>Could someone please explain why this code doesn't work? And what one should do in place of this code?</p>  <p>I am using Java 1.7_75 64-0-bit.</p>  <p>Thanks Rich</p>
