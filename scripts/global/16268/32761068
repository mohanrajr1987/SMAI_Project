<p>I'm trying to map a JSON to a c# ViewModel on a Controller Save action. Basically, the JSON has this structure:</p>  <pre><code>{    "Id": "",    "TypeId": "37",    "FormId": "",    "ExtraData":{       "title": "Some random title",       "contribute": "author",       "location": {           "url": "/Files/ed5cf2ea-c920.jpeg",           "size": "100",           "format": "application/json"       }    } } </code></pre>  <p>Some fields are "know" and some other aren't. The 'ExtraData' is a container for all these unknown fields and they can vary a lot.</p>  <p>I've created a c# VIewModel to map this:</p>  <pre><code>public class ContentViewModel {     public Guid Id { get; set; }     public int TypeId{ get; set; }     public int FormId{ get; set; }     public Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; ExtraData { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>When I make a request, with a JSON like the above, only the 'root' elements of the ExtraData are mapped. The "location" object is mapped to an object.</p>  <p>I've tried to change the Dictionary to a dynamic, still doesn't work. I also tried to create a JsonConverter, but it never got executed. My guess it doesn't work with ASP.NET MVC app out of the box? </p>  <p>I've tried a lot of things, searched and I'm feeling I got to a dead end. </p>  <p>EDIT: The ExtraData will be stored as is in MongoDB. It can be very simple or complex(with multiple nodes and nested objects).</p>
