<p>We have been informed by our new parent company that they want to blacklist JSON.Net "due to vulnerabilities and recommendations from independent consultants who have advised against it". </p>  <p>I have been using this for years and have never heard anything about this. Is there any validity to this concern?</p>  <p>Thanks, Paul</p>
