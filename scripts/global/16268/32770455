<p>I am trying to create a Newtonsoft JObject with a custom DateFormatSting ("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ") using JOjbect.FromObject and I think there is a bug.  My code is:</p>  <pre><code>JObject jBytes = JObject.FromObject(myObject, MyJsonSerializer); </code></pre>  <p>Here, JObject.FromObject seems to ignore the DateFormatString in my custom JsonSerializer.</p>  <p>I have a workaround, but still curious if I am doing something wrong, or if anyone else has seen this?</p>  <p>(workaround)</p>  <pre><code>JObject jBytes = Object.Parse(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myObject, MyDateFormatString); </code></pre>
