<p>My WebApi returning UTF16 JSON result. Attempt to deserialize this using JSON.NET resulted in error:</p>  <p>Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: ï»¿. Path '', line 0, position 0.</p>  <p>I looked into Deserialize method with setting, looks like no option to specify the encoding. UTF8 is hardcoded into the parser?</p>  <p>It seems like JSON.NET can't deserialize UTF16, either the server has to response with UTF8, or the consumer need to re-encode the result from 16 to 8. Are these 2 only the resolution?</p>
