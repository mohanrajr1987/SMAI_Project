<p>Newtonsoft.Json version in NuGet (version 7.0.1) gives the below error message when running code analysis.</p>  <pre><code>CA0001 : Could not resolve reference to mscorlib, Version=2.0.5.0, ... </code></pre>  <p>The error occurs in portable class library that targets .Net 4.5, Windows 8 &amp; ASP.NET Core 5.0</p>  <p>The error does not occur if the portable class library targets .Net 4.6, Windows Universal 10 &amp; ASP.NET Core 5.0</p>  <p>I took Newtonsoft.Json source code and compiled to portable class library targeting .Net 4.5, Windows 8 &amp; ASP.NET Core 5.0. Then I referred to the assembly I compiled instead of the NuGet package. The code analysis problem does not happen in this scenario.</p>  <p>Note that I use Visual Studio 2105 running on Windows 10. Targeting .Net 4.6 is not an option for me due to other dependencies.</p>  <p>Please let me know if there is a good way to make the NuGet package work for the particular PCL target I need and code analysis.</p>
