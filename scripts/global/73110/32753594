<p>Few days ago when I wanted to use SignalR in the project I installed Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR using Package Manager console.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR</p> </blockquote>  <p>I found another simpler solution for the problem that does not require SignalR anymore in the project. I uninstalled the package:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Uninstall-Package Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR</p> </blockquote>  <p>After running above command, i did notice package <code>Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR</code> was removed from <code>package.config</code> file.</p>  <p>I assumed whatever changes installation of package was made into project, it would clean automatically with uninstall command. </p>  <p>However, a day after I saw some errors in console log.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:61135/signalr/reconnect?transport=webSockets&amp;messageId=d-74CFF57F-B%2C0%7CF%2C0%7CD%2C0%7CG%2C1&amp;clientProtocol=1.5&amp;connectionToken=moGkKaoibXu6xg4srnQoGTdxp3axLXQ5h5guoaVYP25MgSKutfN8D%2FyQcJhXamlWjnAhBDIPMjWUEoM9W3%2BP6SQcoQ98jwuiV7lox%2BMNfgyx2x0FOlj6%2BO2PcQ%2Fl3WgwYsbQd7J%2FL1XFVe3yOvNuzw%3D%3D&amp;connectionData=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22notificationhub%22%7D%5D&amp;tid=4' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 502</p> </blockquote>  <p>I felt although I am not initializing the hub in JS anymore the hub initialization code is still running somewhere. I remove StartUp.cs that I added as part of adding SignalR. Ran the application and found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20068075/owin-startup-class-missing">this</a> error on browser.</p>  <p>I then investigated what else is still left inside my code base and found SignalR did leave a lot of dependent packages and code files.</p>  <p>Comparing my package.config file, I have below packages result of install command:</p>  <pre><code>    + &lt;package id="Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core" version="2.2.0"     targetFramework="net45" /&gt;     + &lt;package id="Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.JS" version="2.2.0"     targetFramework="net45" /&gt;     + &lt;package id="Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.SystemWeb" version="2.2.0"     targetFramework="net45" /&gt;     + &lt;package id="Microsoft.Owin" version="2.1.0" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;     +  &lt;package id="Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb" version="2.1.0" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;     + &lt;package id="Microsoft.Owin.Security" version="2.1.0" targetFramework="net45" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>  <p>Do I have to manually uninstall each one of these packages one by one? Any shortcut?</p>  <p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>  <p>There were js files as well in script folder even after uninstall, i had to manually remove it. Is this really required? </p>  <pre><code>jquery.signalR-2.2.0.js  jquery.signalR-2.2.0.min.js </code></pre>  <p>Is this the problem with SignalR package or I did something wrong to face this time wastage situation?</p>
