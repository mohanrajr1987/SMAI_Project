<p>I've written a web application using ASP.NET MVC and SignalR. For each web page in the application there is a SignalR group, used to push updates of the information on that page. In total there are about 400 pages. The information pushed to the pages comes from an Web API to which I upload data created by another system.</p>  <p>The application is run as a cloud service in Azure, using Azure Service Bus as SignalR backplane.</p>  <p>Now I would like to test how many simultaneous users the solution can handle given the current size and count of the web role instances. Any ideas about how to do this?</p>
