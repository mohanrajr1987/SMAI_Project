<p>I working on a chat application in asp.net and I use signalr to send the messages. When user is online, the message will be send to this user and stored in the database, but if the user is offline, the message will just stored in database. As you know, signalr is not reliable. The message may or may not received at the other end. My question is, is there a certain cases that make signalr loss reliability when the user is online ?</p>
