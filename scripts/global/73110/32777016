<p>I have a <code>SignalR</code> application which has multiple hubs (the hubs are part of different projects inside the same solution).</p>  <p>In the front-end I want to start connections based on the component a user is currently viewing.</p>  <p>Let's assume I have 2 hubs and 2 components: <code>TestHub1</code>, <code>TestHub2</code>; <code>Component1</code>, <code>Component2</code>.</p>  <p>In each component I instantiate the connection as following: </p>  <pre><code>var testHub = $.connection.testHub;              //define client methods              $.connection.hub.logging = true;             $.connection.hub.start();         }); </code></pre>  <p>So I do this in multiple components. Now, assuming I have both components connected to <code>TestHub1</code> and <code>TestHub2</code> respectively (at the same time), how can I only stop one connection? If in any component I call <code>$.connection.hub.stop()</code>, both hub connections are stopped.</p>  <p>How can I start and stop the hub connections individually? (Because if at one point after I have stopped both of them and I call <code>$.connection.hub.start()</code>, even if I call this from the component which uses <code>TestHub1</code>,  <code>TestHub2</code> will also start the connection.</p>  <p>So I am looking for a way to start and stop individual hub connections rather that the entire <code>$.connection.start()</code> and <code>$.connection.hub.stop()</code>.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
