<p>I was trying SignalR on Owin Self host. Everything works file but SignalR falls back to server send event instead of using WebSockets. I know IIS 7.5 (Windows 7) does not support websockets but since this is Owin Self host, I was under impression that it is not dependent on IIS and HTTP.sys and websockets should work. </p>  <p>Even Scott Hanselman commented on below link that with OWIN we can do WebSockets anywhere: <a href="https://aspnet.uservoice.com/forums/41199-general-asp-net/suggestions/3090811-websockets-support-in-asp-net-4-5-should-not-be-li" rel="nofollow">https://aspnet.uservoice.com/forums/41199-general-asp-net/suggestions/3090811-websockets-support-in-asp-net-4-5-should-not-be-li</a></p>  <p>Does anyone how how to do true websockets with SignalR (or any other approach) and Owin running on Windows 7?</p>
