<p>I have a SignalR Chat application which is deployed on a server. The chatbox which users see should be renderd by the Chat Application in an iframe, on the targeted website.</p>  <p>I have problems with:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Task OnDisconnected(bool stopCalled)</p> </blockquote>  <p>If the Chat Application is up and running, and the connection is made with the server (for the admin side), and I close the tab, the OnDisconnected gets called instantly with stopCalled = true; </p>  <p>However, from the client page, which is a separate website in IIS, on port 81, instead of 80, if I connect and close the window, then OnDisconnected is called with a delay, and stopCalled is false; </p>  <p>Another weird thing is that if I render the client chat window from the Chat Application (i.e. entering the iframe's URL in a new tab, which renders the page on the same domain), <strong>the OnDisconnected is called instantly</strong>. So I suppose this is happening due to the client being either :</p>  <ul> <li>rendered in an iframe</li> <li>rendered on a different domain</li> <li>both</li> </ul>  <p>Has anyone encountered this before ?  I'm not sure what other details to give, I can give more if needed. </p>  <p>Using ASP.NET MVC 5, signalR 2.2.0, running on IIS 10</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Vlad</p>  <p>---- Update ----</p>  <p>I pulled everything out of the iframe and this is still happening.  </p>
