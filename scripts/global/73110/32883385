<p>I have monitoring web application that runs constantly. The server is Asp.net and it sends notifications to the clients with SignalR. The problem is that after X period of time the client freezes and refresh must be performed. I tried with setInterval to check the SignalR hub connection state <code>$.connection.hub.state !== $.signalR.connectionState.connected</code> and then reconnect but it didn't help.</p>
