<p>I have several websites which implements signalR. All works well.</p>  <p>Now I added a new site. I can see from the client side (using dev tools) connecting to signalR (also getting success on connection).</p>  <p>Now I can see it connects using server sent events but all messages are empty. I open another client (another web site which connects to the same signalR service) and I can see the message rates is much faster and of course with data.</p>  <p>Any idea what could be the issue?</p>  <p>Kind regards.</p>
