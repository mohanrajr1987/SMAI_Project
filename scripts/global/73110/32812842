<p>I need to read data from reader continuously and send it to the caller. I created self hosted window service to act as a signalR. I started infinite loop inside it.</p>  <pre><code>public void ReadTags() {     try     {         while (true)         {             var store = Reader.Read();             var tags = store.ToArray();             Clients.Caller.getTagsRead(tags);             System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);         }     }     catch (Exception ex)     {             System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry("Send", ex.Message + "\n" + ex.StackTrace);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Now, I want to have a control on this method to be able to pause, play or stop this loop next time when a method is invoked. Since Hub creates an instance everytime, this means loop will be running under a different instance. </p>  <p>How can I achieve this?</p>
