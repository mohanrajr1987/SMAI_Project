<p>SignalR 3 and ASP.NET 5 were working together nicely up until the beta7 version. Now Microsoft states that SignalR 3 is 'on hold', and one should not expect the two to work together in the near future:</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-Server/issues/119" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-Server/issues/119</a></p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-Server/issues/121" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-Server/issues/121</a></p>  <p>So the question: is there a way to make at least SignalR 2 work in an ASP.NET 5 app?</p>
