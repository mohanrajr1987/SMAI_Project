<p>I am developing an application which will be used for e-Auctioning. In this application, the several users make their bids. I have implemented Web services to fetch the latest bid from server with jQuery which results as clearing the bidding panel after couple of minutes and the program fails. So, I need to implement Web socket to make call only when the client made the bid. The users are several and different for several bids same time. So i need to use groups. I am new for web sockets.</p>  <p>Can Anyone Help Please??? </p>
