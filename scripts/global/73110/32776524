<p>Following is the scenario I want to achieve using signal R.</p>  <p>If sending of email is going on then message will get display<br> Example: "Sending Email.."</p>  <p>Once email sending is done will show the another message to the same user stating<br> Example: "Email Sent successfully."</p>  <p>How I will achieve this with Signal R and sending the notification to the one user only.</p>  <p>Read the post which are saying use Connection Id but that will be changing not a fix  I want to do this for the Authorized user only or we can say with static userid.</p>
