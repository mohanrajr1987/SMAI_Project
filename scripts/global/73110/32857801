<p>I have a following function which gets called at least 10 times in a second. Every time I have around 100 records which are same except it's LastSeenTime, ReadCount. Since this is a simulator so I know the behaviour however in real time, no of records in an array may vary from 100 - 1000. They may or may not be same. I need to add all distinct records to tagStore which is being displayed in UI thereafter.</p>  <pre><code>$scope.$on('getReadTags', function (event, tags) {          if (($scope.tagStore == null || $scope.tagStore.length == 0) &amp;&amp; tags.length != 0) {             $scope.tagStore = tags;         }         else {             for (var i = 0; i &lt; tags.length; i++) {                 var notFound = true;                  for (var j = 0; j &lt; $scope.tagStore.length; j++) {                     if (tags[i].TagID == $scope.tagStore[j].TagID) {                         $scope.tagStore[j].ReadCount += tags[i].ReadCount;                         $scope.tagStore[j].LastSeenTime = tags[i].LastSeenTime;                         $scope.tagStore[j].DiscoveryTime = tags[i].DiscoveryTime;                         notFound = false;                         break;                     }                 }                 if (!notFound) {                     $scope.tagStore.push(tags[i]);                 }             }         }         $scope.$apply();     }); </code></pre>  <p>When I runs this code, my browser gets stuck. I also noticed that my CPU, RAM utilization is shooting very high. What I need is that this method should be called only after first method has completed it's execution.</p>
