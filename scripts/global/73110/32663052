<p>I am using an OWIN Auth2.0 Authorization Server for Authorizing users and generating Tokens. How can I Connect to a Hub without any Authentication, but prevent anonymous users to call some Methods.</p>  <p>Authentication to FooHub is not required.</p>  <p>Authentication to FooHub.FooMethod is required. </p>  <p>Authentication to FooHub.FooBarMethod is not required.</p>  <h2>Edit</h2>  <p>I have everything exact like in this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28275341/signalr-authorizehubconnection">SignalR AuthorizeHubConnection</a> ,and i got the same problem. Everytime i want to set the "server.User" variable, i get an NullReferenceException.</p>
