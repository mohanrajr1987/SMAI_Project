<p>I am using SignalR with Redis backplane scaleout. Now, the <code>Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Redis</code> package has a dependency to <code>StackExchange.Redis.StrongName</code>.</p>  <p>Since I was already using Redis in my application, I have the <code>StackExchange.Redis</code> package installed.</p>  <p>When I install <code>Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Redis</code> and choose not to install the dependency to the strong-named package for Redis, my application stops working (the client doesn't connect to the server - it tries every method of connecting, falling back to <code>longPolling</code>, but fails).</p>  <p>The strange thing is that if I install <code>StackExchange.Redis.StrongName</code> (at this point I have both the strong-named version and the normal one - so I have duplicate identifiers for every type from Redis) - I uninstall the strong-named package and everything starts working. (even if the strong-named package doesn't have any dependencies).</p>  <p>My question - does the strong-named package contain some specific stuff that SignalR uses (and why does the application work after removing it?)</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
