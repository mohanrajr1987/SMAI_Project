<p>We have a highly scale-able application under construction that rests in various parts throughout the azure cloud. During large scale events in the past, we've had developers hop on to individual azure worker instances and manually monitor the performance of our signalR hubs through performance counters on perfMon. This isn't an ideal situation for a multitude of reasons, primarily that we're running close to 120 servers for bigger events or stress tests. </p>  <p>We're now looking into rolling our own performance monitoring dashboard and finding a way to extract the data from the signalR performance counters on our azure instances into one central location. From what I've been able to discover this far, this doesn't seem like an achievable goal but I wanted to shoot the question out there and hope someone else has gone down this path before. </p>  <p>So the question is this: Can signalR performance metrics be obtained from remote servers in various locations and stored/sent to a central location?</p>
