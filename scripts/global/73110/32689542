<p>We have webpage where there is notification tab. The notifications are taken from a notification table if there are any for a particular user. This event is fired when the page is refreshed.</p>  <p>We now want to implement something where the notification should be displayed to the user instantly without refreshing the page.</p>  <p>I know about SIGNALR with sql dependency. But with sql dependency there comes database polling overhead.</p>
