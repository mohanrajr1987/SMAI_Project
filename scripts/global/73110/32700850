<p>I'm trying to use SignalR with ASP.NET WebForms. It's generating the hubs file and connecting using Server Sent Events after it fails with websockets.</p>  <p>Inspecting with Fiddler the response from the <code>/signalr/connect</code> endpoint it has the following in the body of the reponse:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;     &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The only packet sent over the connection simply says <code>Unknown opcode</code> and the Javascript says:</p>  <pre><code>    WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:50633/signalr/connect?transport=webSockets&amp;clientProtocol=1.5&amp;connectionToken=0urljz0gem5pgMxVSQMzUkVYc4P3dU%2BfqvnW3QCwSQP3YTLzWQPPS0g0yIEhSDlgmn5XRSDA%2BNJ0NgoTYRLM4j9M2KJYXqiVLsZ6hR21ZTJV7PcF0%2BZN%2FMN2xzsPDZxt&amp;connectionData=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22weborderdisplayhub%22%7D%5D&amp;tid=7' failed: Unrecognized frame opcode: 13 </code></pre>  <p>As far as I can tell, there's no opcode 13 in the WebSockets standard.</p>  <p>This Solution has another project (MVC) that has SignalR running perfectly on this machine. That one doesn't send the HTML snippet from above.</p>
