<p>I have a .vbe (.vbs)  file with encrypted script produced by screnc. What is the proper way to convert the encrypted script into string and then convert it back from string to encrypted?</p>  <p>I think I should specify my question. I have created a vbs script. In order to protect it- I encoded it into vbe. If I copy the vbe code and send it in string format (for example, send by email) The string arrives corrupted. How should I handle the code so that I could safely send to other source? Great thanx in advance!</p>
