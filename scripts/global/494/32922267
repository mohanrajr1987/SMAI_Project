<p>I want to compare an wscript.argument that I got to the vbs to a string, so depending in that comparation one action or another is performed. I have tried this, but I get an error. How can I solve it? How can I make the type comparation?</p>  <pre><code>Set args = Wscript.Arguments Set accessPath = args.Item(5)      If accessPath = "-" Then     objExcel.Cells(15, 3).Value = " "      Else     objExcel.Cells(15, 3).Value = accessPath     End If </code></pre>
