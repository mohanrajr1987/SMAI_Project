<p>I work in an anatomical pathology lab. In conjunction with dissection and screening cases, I write the code for our voice recognition system so that all of our specimen templates can be operated by commands. The goal is to not touch our mouse and keyboard and specimen all in the same. I’m fairly illiterate in Visual Basic, but have been able to keep up with and maintain our system as it’s needed. I  have a potential small think I can’t figure out. Here is an example of a template:</p>  <p>It contains $q$one$q$ portion of **** soft tissue measuring $k$LargDim$k$ cm in greatest dimension. ***</p>  <p>I have two placement to input information, 1) the content in between the $ in which we capture information discretely and 2) the *** which is any remaining information needed for pathologist. ^{up} navigates in between $ attributes (dictated as “next”) and ^{right} which navigates between stars.  A caveat is that once information is placed in stars, the stars go away, but the information in between $ still can be navigated in between because these are discrete fields that are behind the scene is capturing.</p>  <p>So my question, I want to be able to say next for both navigating from stars to discrete fields. I know the difference because I’m writing it, but the folks in the lab will be frustrated and can not discern. I am searching for a way where I can search the text, look for what is first (stars or an attribute) and highlight the first available.</p>  <p>I started to write the following but it didn't work well:</p>  <p>Sub Main</p>  <p>SendKeys "^{up}", True</p>  <p>' Checks To see if the highlighted region is on *** or on an attribute</p>  <p>SendKeys "^c", True If Clipboard = "***" Then         SendKeys "^{right}", True     Else         SendKeys "^{up}", True     End If</p>  <p>End Sub</p>  <p>Does this make sense? Can anyone help me?</p>
