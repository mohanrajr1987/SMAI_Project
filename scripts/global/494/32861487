<p>Is it possible to create a dynamic user form using VB Script? The form needs to pull in values from a tool and also from an excel sheet and should also contain checkboxes and textboxes and OK Buttons. (This script is written inside a tool).</p>  <p>If someone could guide me I would really appreciate it. I'm new to VB Script and only know how to create msg boxes and text boxes. Please help!</p>
