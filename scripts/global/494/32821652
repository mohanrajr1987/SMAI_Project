<p>I would like to add a vbscript as a macro into the slide of my presentation and show an interactive map. But the thing is I would prefer to call for an api (google maps) in order to do that. Now I have found an answer here :</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4158492/code-to-get-gps-coordinates-from-address-vb6-vba-vbscript">Code to Get GPS Coordinates from Address (VB6/VBA/VBScript)</a></p>  <p>but I can't get it to work and it is not designed for powerpoint.</p>
