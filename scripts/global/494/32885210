<p>Im trying to run VBScript through nncron to load data through XML from SP site but I get this error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>msxml6.dll: Access is denied.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I already added the SP site to trusted sites and enable access data source across domain. So it seems like I need to fix IE settings again but I am not sure how.</p>  <p>Note: When I manually run the script through cmd it works (with my credentiels) but not with cron.</p>
