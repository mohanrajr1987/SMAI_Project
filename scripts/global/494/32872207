<p>This VBScript should get a random number between 1 and 3, and then type the letter according to the number and type it into the notepad that it opened and then goto the next line, but for some reason it doesn't enter the letter. Can someone explain the problem to me please? Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>Set ws = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") ws.Run "notepad.exe" Wscript.Sleep 100  do  RAND = Int((3 - 1 + 1) * Rnd + 1)  if RAND=1 Then     key = a elseif RAND=2 Then     key = b elseif RAND=3 Then     key = c end if  ws.SendKeys key ws.SendKeys "{ENTER}" Wscript.sleep 1000  loop </code></pre>
