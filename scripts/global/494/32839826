<p>What is the meaning of <code>is</code> and <code>in</code> in VBScript? Because they appear in blue when I write them in UFT.</p>  <p>Can I use them to <strong>check whether a value exists</strong> in matrix <strong>without looping</strong>? Because that's actually what I'm looking for. I mean something like this:</p>  <pre><code>If "Ahmed" is in Matrix() Then     msgbox "He's in" End If </code></pre>
