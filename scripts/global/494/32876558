<p>I got this script to set the computer name from the serial number to use when building a pc with a SCCM task sequence. Our company sets the computer name against the asset tag.</p>  <p>Would anybody be able to tell me how I can modify the following script to use the asset tag?</p>  <pre><code>SET env = CreateObject(“Microsoft.SMS.TSEnvironment”) strComputer=”.” ‘ Connect to WMI Set objWMIService=GetObject(“winmgmts:” &amp; “{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\” &amp;strComputer&amp; “\root\cimv2”) ‘ Find the Service Tag, which will make up the last part of the computer name Set colservicetag=objWMIService.ExecQuery(“Select * from Win32_Bios”) For Each objservicetag in colservicetag strName = objservicetag.serialnumber Next ‘ Set the variable env(“OSDCOMPUTERNAME”) = strName </code></pre>
