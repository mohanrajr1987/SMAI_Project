<p>I have to create a vscript a bit complex, at least for me.. If anyone could help, I will thank you so much! :D</p>  <p>these are the tasks that the script needs to take care of:</p>  <pre><code>-run this cmd file located on "C:\Program Files\Paradigm\Paradigm-15\Services\bin\cli\PG_epos_user_list.cmd" -pns_host localhost </code></pre>  <p>that cmd generates a list of users so, from this cmd's output, I need to check if current logged accountname are listed there (check if it matches)</p>  <p>-If it is not listed, run another cmd -> </p>  <pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Paradigm\Paradigm-15\Services\bin\cli\PG_epos_user_create.cmd" -pns_host localhost -epos_user &lt;user&gt; -member_list &lt;user&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but in this case, we have to input logged userid on each "" on that commandline.</p>  <p>then, compare the content on a ini file, stored on a shared disk, with the values on 2 files located on <code>C:\ProgramData\Paradigm\Paradigm-15\Applications\config\env\common\</code></p>  <pre><code>1_epos_license_location  &amp; 1_epos_license_location.tcl  </code></pre>  <p>Get the license value from section "[License]" <code>value Stratimagic=**licensevalue**</code> and be sure that matches with the license info on both <code>1_epos_license_location &amp; 1_epos_license_location.tcl.</code></p>  <p>If it not matches, update both files. Also, check if W disk is mapped, if not, advise with a msgbox</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!, Regards</p>
