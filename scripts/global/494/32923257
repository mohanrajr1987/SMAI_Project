<p>I'm looking for a vbs to exe converter, so far with no luck. After searching through.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.robvanderwoude.com/scriptcompilers.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.robvanderwoude.com/scriptcompilers.php</a></p>  <p>My antivirus quarantines all the compiled files.</p>  <p>On the site he does mention:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Also note that most anti-virus software doesn't "like" compiled scripts.   On my own computer, compiled scripts are the most common source of "false positives".</p> </blockquote>  <p>Even so I found that some of the programs listed have articles about them that explain why I really don't want them on my pc, has anyone found/got a VBS compiler that doesn't have a backdoor(or something) or the output is not recognized as a virus and immediately quarantined?</p>
