<p>Not sure how to phrase this exactly but ill try, Im making a joke Batch file that creates temp VBS files to perform actions to prank my friend.</p>  <p>Here is the code(ignore the ====names==== i will get rid of those later): </p>  <pre><code>:loopall =====CD OPEN====== :Set oWMP = CreateObject("WMPlayer.OCX.7") :Set colCDROMs = oWMP.cdromCollection :do :if colCDROMs.Count &gt;= 1 then :For i = 0 to colCDROMs.Count - 1 :colCDROMs.Item(i).Eject :Next :For i = 0 to colCDROMs.Count - 1 :colCDROMs.Item(i).Eject :Next :End If :wscript.sleep 5000 :loop findstr "^:" "%~sf0"&gt;temp.vbs &amp; cscript //nologo temp.vbs &amp; del temp.vbs  ======Caps lock Spam===== :Set wshShell =wscript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell") :do :wscript.sleep 100 :wshshell.sendkeys "{CAPSLOCK}" :loop findstr "^:" "%~sf0"&gt;temp.vbs &amp; cscript //nologo temp.vbs &amp; del temp.vbs  =====Type you have been pranked==== :Set wshShell = wscript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell") :do :wscript.sleep 100 :wshshell.sendkeys "You have been pranked." :loop findstr "^:" "%~sf0"&gt;temp.vbs &amp; cscript //nologo temp.vbs &amp; del temp.vbs goto loopall </code></pre>  <p>BUT the places i got my VBS code from were already looped,so it doesnt work right (The temp file never gets deleted.And im guessing it would only loop 1 VBS and never go on to B and C)</p>  <p>I need someone who knows VBScript to help me De-loop The VBS codes so i can have all 3 loop simultaneously through the Batch goto command.</p>  <p>I tried myself but got hit with a bunch of errors on the .VBS files.</p>
