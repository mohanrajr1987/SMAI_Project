<p>Trying to create a VBScript that loops continuously until it finds the specific file and renames it to a different extension with minute and seconds:</p>  <pre><code>do Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set myFile = fso.GetFile("C:\Users\user\Downloads\test.txt")  If (fso.FileExists(myFile)) Then      myFile.Move "C:\Users\user\Downloads\test.xml" End If  WScript.Sleep 1000  loop </code></pre>  <p>The above works and renames the file but when looped it errors with "file cannot be found". Will need to add a else statement but having a hard time doing that. </p>
