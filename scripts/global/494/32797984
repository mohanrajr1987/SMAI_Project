<p>I want to download multiple files from a list of links. The website where I find the links is protected. This is why I want to use IE (using the current session/cookie). The target of each link is a xml file. The files are too large to open and then save. So I need to save them directly (right-click, save target as). </p>  <p>The list of links looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://example.com/report?_hhhh=XML"Link A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://example.com/report?_aaaa=XML"Link B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to loop through all links and save each target. Currently I have problems with the "Save As". I don't really know how to do it. This is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code>Sub DownloadAllLinks()  Dim IE As Object Dim Document As Object Dim List As Object Dim Link As Object  ' Before I logged in to the website Set IE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application") IE.Visible = True IE.Navigate ("https:\\......\links.html")  Do While IE.Busy   DoEvents Loop  ' Detect all links on website Set Document = IE.Document Set List = Document.getElementsByTagName("a")  ' Loop through all links to download them  For Each Link In List  ' Now I need to automate "save target as" / right-click and then "save as" ...  Next Link End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Do you have any ideas to automate "Save As" for each link?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated. Many thanks, Uli</p>
