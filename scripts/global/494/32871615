<p>I have a HTA that is linked to a mainframe emulator and I am trying to display the mainframe emulator lines in the HTA so as to show the operator what the HTA is doing without having to see the emulator.  I have a loop that captures the lines from the emulator and appends each line to a variable. At the end of the loop, I display the variable in the HTA using an InnerHTML command.  </p>  <pre><code>For x = 1 to 24   host.ReadScreen celldat,80,x,1   da2 = da2 &amp; key &amp; celldat &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;" Next  dataarea.InnerHTML = "&lt;span style=" &amp; chr(34) &amp; "width: 734px; font-size: 10px; left: 50%; margin-left: -350px; font-family: courier new;" &amp; chr(34) &amp; "&gt;" &amp; da2 &amp; "&lt;/span&gt;" </code></pre>  <p>The code works more or less as I want.<br> But <em>only the first line of the dataarea has the formatting</em> that I am applying with span style.<br><br> All lines of the variable have the same font-size and colour, <strong>but only the first line is left aligned</strong> and <em>all subsequent lines are centered</em> which seems to be coming from the original paragraph formatting for the position of dataarea.</p>  <p>Is there an alternate way in which I could display the da2 variable in HTA so that formatting of each line is consistent?</p>
