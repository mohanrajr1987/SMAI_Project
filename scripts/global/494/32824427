<p>I am using UFT 12.02. In the function library I have a function as <em>ReportEvent(Status, TestStep, ExpectedResult, ActualResult, OptionalLink)</em> and another function with the same name as <em>ReportEvent(TestStep, ExpectedResult, ActualResult)</em>. </p>  <p>when I call the <strong>ReportEvent</strong> function in my script it calls the function that mentioned at the highest LOC of the two i.e. the last one to be written.</p>  <p>it doesn't stop my work but my curiosity got better of me and I thought may be y'all might be able to help.</p>
