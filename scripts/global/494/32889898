<p>I have a script on a Server 2008 R2 VM which calls to the shell to <code>robocopy</code> a bunch of files into a local directory and then, several seconds later, checks if a certain 2.5 MB .msi exists. It kept returning false even though <code>robocopy</code> successfully completed and visible inspection reveals the file is there on time. I reproduced this bug on my local Windows 7 with a script:</p>  <pre><code>Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set objWshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") Dim file : file = "LargeFile.exe"  objWshShell.Run "xcopy ""..\" &amp; file &amp; """ .", 1, True WScript.Echo "EXISTS: " &amp; objFSO.FileExists(file) </code></pre>  <p><code>LargeFile.exe</code> is an executable around 7MB. I place it one directory above my script, execute the script, and it prints <code>EXISTS: False</code>. I ran the script several times with this result before some switch flipped and it started reporting <code>True</code> consistently.</p>  <p>It still happens intermittently on my VM. It will work correctly several times, I'll do something else for a few minutes, and when I come back it stops working again.</p>  <p>What's going on here? I need to use the shell for copying because the network is iffy and causes <code>objFSO.CopyFolder()</code> to crash.</p>
