<p>I have a simple login script that I use to map drives for users</p>  <pre><code>On Error Resume Next  Set objNetwork = CreateObject("Wscript.Network")  Set colDrives = objNetwork.EnumNetworkDrives  For i = 0 to colDrives.Count-1 Step 2     objNetwork.RemoveNetworkDrive colDrives.Item(i) Next  Dim Network Set Network = CreateObject("Wscript.network")  Network.MapNetworkDrive "P:","\\server-A\share name A" Network.MapNetworkDrive "N:","\\server-A\share name B" Network.MapNetworkDrive "S:","\\server-A\share name C" Network.MapNetworkDrive "L:","\\server-B\share name A" Network.MapNetworkDrive "T:","\\server-C\share name" Network.MapNetworkDrive "V:","\\server-B\share name B" Network.MapNetworkDrive "W:","\\server-D\share name" </code></pre>  <p>I would like to put the </p>  <pre><code>"\\server-A\share name A" "\\server-A\share name B" "\\server-A\share name C" "\\server-B\share name A" "\\server-C\share name" "\\server-B\share name B" "\\server-D\share name" </code></pre>  <p>In a text file and have my script read it and insert it into the script. Can anyone help with how to do this?</p>
