<p>I have a VBS regex code</p>  <pre><code>    Dim re, targetString, colMatch, objMatch Set re = New RegExp With re   .Pattern = "rain(.*)"   .Global = True   .IgnoreCase = True End With targetString = "The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain"  Set colMatch = re.Execute(targetString) For each objMatch  in colMatch   wscript.echo objMatch.Value &amp; "&lt;br /&gt;" Next </code></pre>  <p>It returns "rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain" But I need the "in Spain falls mainly in the plain" to be returned"  Usually what is in brackets should be returned, and not what is behind the brackets Which way to do it correct?</p>
