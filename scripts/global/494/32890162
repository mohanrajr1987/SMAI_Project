<p>I have a requirement to copy some files and folders to a USB drive with a specific volumelabel (to take into account drive letter may change)</p>  <p>I am using the below to determine, and return, the drive letter; how to I then use this to copy files to that drive (and overwrite any existing files)</p>  <p>I only know how to use objShell.run "cmd /c copy c:\temp\file.xml X:\temp file\ /y" but obviously can't use that in this case.</p>  <pre><code> Set objShell = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")  Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set colDrives = objFSO.Drives For Each objDrive in colDrives    Select Case objDrive.DriveType      Case 1     If objDrive.VolumeName = "MyUSB" Then '        Message = Message &amp; "Drive letter: " &amp; objDrive.DriveLetter &amp; VbCrLf '        Message = Message &amp; "Drive type: " &amp; objDrive.DriveType &amp; VbCrLf '       Message = Message &amp; "Volume name: " &amp; objDrive.VolumeName &amp; VbCrLf &amp; VbCrLf '      End If   End Select Next </code></pre>
