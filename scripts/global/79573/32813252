<p>First of all I will describe what I want to achieve. I'm writing desktop application which produce and process certain raports. One of possibility user should have is store them in Google Drive. User which use this application can be described as untrusted, third part user.</p>  <p>So my question is: could client_secret.json which for instnce is result of following tutorial: <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/java" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/java</a> can be embedded into application? Is it safe or should I choose other scenario? If it's not safe to share this file with untrusted user what other options do I have?</p>
