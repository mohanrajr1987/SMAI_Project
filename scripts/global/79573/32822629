<p>I implement access to Google Drive in my iOS app. This has been an active feature in the app since middle of 2014 and functions properly under iOS 6, 7 &amp; 8. I am currently checking my project for compatibility with iOS 9.</p>  <p>I've downloaded the latest <code>google-api-objectivec-client</code> to ensure my project remains up to date.</p>  <p>I redid the standard Google implementation... as detailed in <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/ios/quickstart" rel="nofollow">this page</a> and included for completeness at the end of this post.</p>  <p><strong>Problem: When I attempt to build in any of my releases I receive the error "<code>GTMSessionFetcher.h</code> file not found".</strong></p>  <p>I'm certain I've implemented the API properly as per the steps below / on the Google web page.</p>  <p>I've looked through older versions of my code but unfortunately I did not back up the Google SDK, so cannot easily tell what has changed.</p>  <p>It seems to stem from this... within <code>GTMOAuth2Authentication.h</code>...</p>  <pre><code>#if GTM_USE_SESSION_FETCHER   #import "GTMSessionFetcher.h" #else   #import "GTMHTTPFetcher.h" #endif  // GTM_USE_SESSION_FETCHER </code></pre>  <p>I dont understand how <code>GTM_USE_SESSION_FETCHER</code> is set and why it would be true in this instance.</p>  <p>Any advice greatly appreciated.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Google Drive API Implementation for iOS</strong></p>  <p><em>Note: Steps 1 &amp; 2 complete without issue.</em></p>  <p>Step 3: Prepare the project</p>  <ol> <li>In Xcode, create a new project to contain the sample app:  <ul> <li>Click File > New > Project, select the Single View Application template, and click Next.</li> <li>Fill in the Product Name, Organization Name, and Company Identifier. Make sure to select Objective-C as the Language, and then click Next.</li> <li>Select a destination directory for the project and click Create.</li> </ul></li> <li>Add the client library by dragging <code>GTL.xcodeproj</code> from the <code>Source</code> directory of the client library download folder above into the XCode project.</li> <li>In the XCode Project Navigator, select the project you created to reveal the project settings.</li> <li>Select the Build Phases tab in the project settings and modify the <code>Link Binary with Libraries</code> list to include:  <ul> <li><code>libGTLTouchStaticLib.a</code> from the GTL project.</li> <li><code>Security.framework</code> and <code>SystemConfiguration.framework</code>.</li> </ul></li> <li>Select the Build Settings tab in the project settings and modify the following two build settings:  <ul> <li>Add <code>-ObjC -all_load</code> to the Linking > Other Linker Flags setting. A good way to edit these fields is to click once on the field name to select it, then click Enter to input the setting.</li> <li>Add the client library headers to the application project by adding the Source directory of the client library to the Search Paths > User headers search path section with the recursive option. You can select the recursive option either by appending ** to the path or by double-clicking the entered path and selecting recursive in the dialog that appears. To find the absolute path to this directory in a Unix-based system, navigate a terminal window to the directory where you downloaded the client library in Step 2, cd into the Source directory, and type the pwd command.</li> </ul></li> <li>Drag <code>GTMOAuth2ViewTouch.xib</code> from client library's <code>Source/OAuth2/Touch</code> folder into the app's <code>Supporting Files</code> folder.</li> <li>Add the Drive API service by dragging <code>GTLDrive.h</code> and <code>GTLDrive_Sources.m</code> from the client library's <code>Source/Services/Drive/Generated</code> folder directly to the application project.</li> </ol>
