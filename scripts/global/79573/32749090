<p>I am not very familiar with the DriveApi and right now I am wondering what the method <code>DriveId.zzcC(String arg)</code> does. After using it, the metadata is fetched successfully! But why is that? I saved the file's ResourceId previously in the android's shared prefs. Is this a common / recommended way to work with this API on Android? I want to keep track on the files' Ids in different activities in my app.</p>  <pre><code>DriveFile file = Drive.DriveApi.getFile(getGoogleApiClient(), DriveId.zzcC(existingId)); file.getMetadata(getGoogleApiClient()) .setResultCallback(new ResultCallback&lt;DriveResource.MetadataResult&gt;() {                         @Override                         public void onResult(DriveResource.MetadataResult result) {      ... </code></pre>  <p>It seems to be a converter (String to DriveId?), is this correct? And what is the difference between the DriveId and the ResourceId?</p>  <p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/drive/DriveId" rel="nofollow">docs</a> seem to miss this method. </p>
