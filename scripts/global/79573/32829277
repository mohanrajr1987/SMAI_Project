<p>Recently (5 days ago) I started seeing 404 errors from one of our python scripts as it attempts to download a Google SS through Drive API.  The script had been working well up until 5 days ago.</p>  <p>What's especially strange is that this script downloads several Google SS files and it's only this one file that throws a 404, the others download fine.</p>  <p>I've tried to recreate what the script does in the browser, and I'm stumped.</p>  <p>For example, in the case of a working/good GSS file:  I add a valid 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' to this URL</p>  <p><a href="https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/files/GOOD_GOOGLE_SS_KEY?download_url=file[%27exportLinks%27]" rel="nofollow">https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/files/GOOD_GOOGLE_SS_KEY?download_url=file[%27exportLinks%27]</a></p>  <p>and I get a JSON response containing download links and other info about the file.  I tested one of the export links</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/export?id=GOOD_GOOGLE_SS_KEY&amp;exportFormat=xlsx" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/export?id=GOOD_GOOGLE_SS_KEY&amp;exportFormat=xlsx</a></p>  <p>and the file downloads just fine.</p>  <p>But things get weird when I try to go through the same process for the bad/404 file.  If I try to access the exportLinks url, I get a 404 error.  However, if I use the same "bad" file key in an export link, it downloads fine.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any suggestions on what might be causing this?  File sharing settings?  File ownership settings?  Thank you in advance.</p>
