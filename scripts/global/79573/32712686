<p>I have created an Google Spreadsheet addon for my website.I created my own APIs to communicate between addon and my server and all other business logic. Now the problem is that I have given an IP secuity feature on my website for API, that allows API from certain IPs only.Now the users who have enabled IP security in their account, they aren't able to login into spreadsheet addon as, the API calls are coming from some other IPs.</p>  <p>Now I thought to automatically white list the IPs of google drive, but I dont know what IPs should I block or how to proceed.</p>  <p>And I also think that google would be using multiple IPs and continuously changing its IP.</p>  <p>can anyone help?</p>
