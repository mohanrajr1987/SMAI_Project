<p>I'm running a query on the Android SDK for Google Drive to check if a directory with a specific name exists or creating it otherwise (directory name is the resource title on Google Drive).</p>  <p>The problem I'm having with the following code is that it never finds my folder and creates a new one every time and I'm not sure why. It successfully finds the directory if the SDK created it itself.</p>  <pre><code>public static final String FOLDER_NAME_CORE = "My Core Folder";  MetadataBuffer meta = Drive.DriveApi.query(mGoogleApiClient, new Query.Builder()             .addFilter(Filters.eq(SearchableField.TRASHED, false))             .addFilter(Filters.eq(SearchableField.TITLE, FOLDER_NAME_CORE ))             .setSortOrder(new SortOrder.Builder().addSortDescending(SortableField.MODIFIED_DATE).build()) .build()).await().getMetadataBuffer();  if (metadataBufferResult.getCount() &gt; 0) {     Log.d(TAG, "Creating new folder");      ... } else {     Log.d(TAG, "Using existing folder"); } </code></pre>  <p>I've tried making the folder publicly shared but it didn't change anything (as expected). Does anyone know what I have to change to make it find the existing folder instead? As far as I know <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/drive/query/SearchableField" rel="nofollow">this list</a> is the only possible search options.</p>
