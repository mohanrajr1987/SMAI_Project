<p>I uploaded many photos with no EXIF data, but with their date in the name. Google Photos used upload date to sort them. I'd like to use the date in their name to modify them.</p>  <p>So far I tried to use Drive API to change modification date, I can change it but it is not used. I also tried to modify imageMediaMetadata.date, but it seems to be read-only to me.</p>  <p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>function myFunction() {   var files = DriveApp.getFilesByName("IMG-20150402-WA0002_1.jpg")   while (files.hasNext()) {     var file = files.next();     var name = file.getName().toUpperCase();     if (name.indexOf("-WA") &gt; -1) {       if (name.indexOf("IMG-20") == 0 || name.indexOf("VID-20") == 0) {         var y = name.substr(4, 4);         var m = name.substr(8, 2);         var d = name.substr(10, 2);          var file2 = Drive.Files.get(file.getId());         file2.imageMediaMetadata.date = y+"-"+m+"-"+d+"T12:00:00.000Z";         var file3 = Drive.Files.patch(file2, file.getId());         Logger.log(name + " no ok " + file3.imageMediaMetadata.date);  // same as file2       }     }   } </code></pre>  <p>I could delete them, modify the original files and re-upload, but before that I'd like to be sure there is no other way.</p>  <p>Thank you. </p>
