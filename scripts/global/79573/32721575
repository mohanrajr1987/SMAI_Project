<p>Hi I 'm trying this web app <a href="https://github.com/scotch-io/easy-node-authentication" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/scotch-io/easy-node-authentication</a> and works well.</p>  <p>I try to access with my google credential and it works well. My needs is to save in appdata (<a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/web/appdata" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/drive/web/appdata</a>) folder in google drive some data, but I've try to access using this npm (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-drive" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-drive</a>) and I've the follow answer:</p>  <pre><code>{ "error": { "errors": [ { "domain": "global", "reason": "insufficientPermissions", "message": "Insufficient Permission" } ], "code": 403, "message": "Insufficient Permission" } }  </code></pre>  <p>so I access to my google console but I not understand how to add  "<a href="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appfolder" rel="nofollow">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appfolder</a>" permission</p>  <p>I 've also googled for enable access to user google drive but now google dev console is really changed from example so ... I dunno how to give permission to my web app to write some file in user google drive.</p>  <p>thanks</p>
