<p>I'm trying to access google drive through my android app for a specific account. In addition, I also have <strong>sign in with google</strong> option, so that users can login to the app through google+ and this will be the google account which play services is using.</p>  <p>However, I want to store some files on a specific google drive account say <code>abcd@gmail.com</code>. I tried using the <code>GoogleAPIClient</code> by specifying DRIVE API, required scopes and an account name as 'abcd@gmail.com', which looks something like below:</p>  <pre><code>serviceClient = new GoogleApiClient.Builder(this)          .addApi(Drive.API)          .setAccountName("abcd@gmail.com").addConnectionCallbacks(this)          .addScope(Drive.SCOPE_FILE)            .addOnConnectionFailedListener(this)          .build(); serviceClient.connect(); </code></pre>  <p>But, I'm getting an error :</p>  <pre><code>The specified account does not exist on this device. Please choose different account. </code></pre>  <p>How can I connect to specific/static account of google to access drive APIs.</p>  <p>Thanks Saurabh</p>
