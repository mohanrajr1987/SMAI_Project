<p>I'm using a Google Drive folder to backup some info from my app. I don't use App Folder since I want the user to be able to upload files to that same folder (for example, to upload a backup obtained by somebody else).</p>  <p>The code I use is the following:</p>  <pre><code>Query query = new Query.Builder()              .addFilter(Filters.eq(SearchableField.TITLE, backupName))              .build();  DriveApi.MetadataBufferResult result =         mDriveFolder                 .queryChildren(mGoogleApiClient, query)                 .await();  if (result == null || !result.getStatus().isSuccess()) {     return null; }  MetadataBuffer buffer = result.getMetadataBuffer(); if (buffer.getCount() == 0) {     buffer.close();      return null; } Metadata m = buffer.get(0); //get first </code></pre>  <p>This way, I can find the backup file only if it was uploaded by my app through the backup function. If I upload to my Drive a file from my Desktop, or create a new document just for testing purposes, it is not found. (and from Drive I can correctly see all the files, either from my app or not, and I am the owner).</p>  <p>So, I tried to list and log all the folder contents:</p>  <pre><code>DriveApi.MetadataBufferResult result = mDriveFolder.listChildren(mGoogleApiClient).await();  if (result == null || !result.getStatus().isSuccess()) {     return null; }  MetadataBuffer buffer = result.getMetadataBuffer();  for(Metadata m: buffer){     Log.d(TAG, m.getTitle()+" - "+m.getOriginalFilename()); } </code></pre>  <p>and only the files uploaded by my app are logged.</p>  <p>So, how can I get every content of my folder from the app, irrespective of its source? Am I missing something?</p>
