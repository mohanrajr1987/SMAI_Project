<p>Hi, everyone. I have a use case for my system where I want to save my user's photos/files. I want to upload these photos/files into Google Drive storage and save the link in my database.</p>  <p>It actually works :).</p>  <p>But the problem is when I upload a photo/file, its uploaded to specific user's account (the user that currently logged-in in browser). How could I use a single account for my entire system, so every user can upload their files/photos to my system in same Google Drive storage (which is my account)?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
