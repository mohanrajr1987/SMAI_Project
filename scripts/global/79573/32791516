<p>I've some images stored in Google drive and I'm trying to get a thumbnail to display on a web page. If I use <code>$image-&gt;getThumbnail( )</code> on the image file rappresented with class Google_Service_Drive_DriveFile it returns <code>null</code>. How i can create a thumbnail and set it with <code>$image-&gt;setThumbnail(Google_Service_Drive_DriveFileThumbnail $thumbnail )</code>. There are also getThumbnailLink and setThumbnailLink methods, how I can use it?. I don't find doc or examples on web.</p>
