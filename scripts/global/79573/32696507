<p>Some times ago I received a message that developer will responsible to pay for data transfer using Google Drive SDK for iOS.</p>  <p>Is this still actual, how to calculate a price for it? As I understood if many users will download huge data via google drive storage, it will be expensive for me as developer using SDK.</p>
