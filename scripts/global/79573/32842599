<p>I use update() function of Google Drive API to update (with convert=true parameter) a csv file to google drive.<br> The result is an updated Google Spreadsheet (single worksheet)</p>  <p>Can I update a specificied worksheet of the file (passing the ID) ?<br> Every update call create a different worksheet (different ID) and I don't need it changes.<br> I have this problem because an external app read this file using google file ID and worksheet ID.</p>  <p>I use PHP API.</p>  <p>Thanks all</p>
