<p>I am trying to upload files to Google-Drive from my website using Java-script file it provides after creating app. While creating app on Google Drive for this I have added Authorized redirect URI &amp; Authorized JavaScript origins domains like "www.mydomain.com". But now, my website URL contains sub-domain like "www.subdomain.mydomain.com". This sub-domain changes with the users.</p>  <p>When I try to upload to Google-Drive from such URL then Gogole-Drive is responding with error message <strong>origin_mismatch</strong>. I know it is because of URL registered (while creating app on Google-Drive) is different then URL from where I am trying to upload.</p>  <p>So, how can I upload files to Google-Drive from URL which contains sub-domain and it (sub-domain) changes with users.</p>
