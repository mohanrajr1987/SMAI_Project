<p>Using Google Drive SDK I retrieve the thumbnailLink property for a Google document and I then use this to download the generated image, which I cache on a file server. However, I'm seeing that I often get a thumbnail of an older version of my document, it could be a version cached by Google drive.</p>  <p>This thumbnail link has this form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/...&amp;sz=s220" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/...&amp;sz=s220</a></p>  <p>You can get different thumbnail sizes based on the sz argument. The interesting thing is that I'm seeing different versions (older or newer thumbnails of my document) of the thumbnail depending on the value of the sz argument.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get a fresh thumbnail when a Google document has been updated?</p>
