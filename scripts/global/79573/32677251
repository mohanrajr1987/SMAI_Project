<p>I'm looking for a way that I can programmatically get diffs of a file that is on Google Drive and information of who modified the file.</p>  <p>It seems that Google Drive API does not provide diffs, but they provide revisions of a file via Revisions API. Revisions.list() method returns an URL of each revision of a file. So, it is possible to check the difference between two revisions if I download them and compare with each other. But I cannot know who modified the file in this way. Response of Revisions.list() method returns only one editor of the file if other people are editing at the same time.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea how to get such data? I found that I could see how &amp; who modified a file on Google Drive.  ( File -> See reision history )</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
