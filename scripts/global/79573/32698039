<p>I have an app setup with the Web-Client structure, using it as a kind of server manager for many users. They can't access the account but only some folders, as I do all the authorization steps by code. I chose this kind of account in Drive API so I could upload big files, as service accounts were very limited. But now there are some files that can be uploaded through the Web drive.google.com domain, and I need to own this files that the e-mails from my same domain have uploaded. So I was thinking if it was possible to have a service account to change permissions only, and do all the file uploads though the Web-Client Account within the same project and email? Thanks.</p>
