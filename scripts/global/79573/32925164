<p>I've been trying to allow a program I am writing to access Google Drive Applications. I have gotten the client secrets information successfully, and have copy and pasted the example code and tried using it to successfully authenticate my program and use the google drive API.</p>  <p>However, when it gets to the line</p>  <pre><code>    Credential credential = new AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp(flow, new LocalServerReceiver()).authorize("user"); </code></pre>  <p>I get this error. This error has been posted about before, and I've tried essentially every solution. I've elevated both my program and all the java.exe files to administrator and tried running the program and I still got this error. </p>  <p>The full error is:</p>  <pre><code>    Oct 03, 2015 11:48:39 AM com.google.api.client.util.store.FileDataStoreFactory setPermissionsToOwnerOnly     WARNING: unable to change permissions for everybody: D:\directory     Oct 03, 2015 11:48:39 AM com.google.api.client.util.store.FileDataStoreFactory setPermissionsToOwnerOnly     WARNING: unable to change permissions for owner: D:\directory </code></pre>  <p>I've also tried overriding the setPermissionToOwnerOnly when I instantiated the FileDataStoreFactory but that failed as well. </p>  <p>I have tried the following solutions:</p>  <pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30634827/warning-unable-to-change-permissions-for-everybody http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24382069/error-while-executing-google-prediction-api-command-line-sample https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-analytics-data-export-api/-7BH7Z40gkw (where the client secret data was hard coded into the program, this is bad, I know, but it didn't work anyway) </code></pre>  <p>I don't know what to do at this point. I am running my program off a flash drive, and I tried running it off my computer as well, but it still failed. I am using NetBeans 8.0.2.</p>  <p>The error comes up as a warning, so maybe there is some way to just ignore the warning and proceed? That could be a solution, but I've researched and I'm not sure if that's a possibility. I am running windows 10 if that matters.</p>
