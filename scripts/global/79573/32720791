<p>I have Google Drive installed on my Windows 7 PC. In Google Drive I have an Excel document which I want to share as a Google sheet - not a problem, convert document to Google Spreadsheets and share so others view it on the web. </p>  <p>However the problem I have is that I update this Excel document regularly. But if I convert it to a Google Spreadsheets it opens a new instance of the document - therefore making the initial shared link point to old data and not the latest. </p>  <p>Is there a script I can use to ensure Google Spreadsheets gets updated automatically with the changes I make to the Excel document that is on Google Drive? </p>  <p>Before anyone asks, I use Excel as it does provide me a much easier interface for updating the data I have. I use quite a lot of the shape objects as well on the Excel document (which are a pain to create, modify on Google Sheets).</p>  <p>I did try the import function of Google Sheets (even though this is not an automatic option) but this did not bring the shape objects across or the text boxes I have in the Excel document.</p>
