<p>I am looking for open source shopping cart solutions which provides the following two features together - "multi seller support" and "contact a seller".</p>  <p>Amazon, Ebay etc provides such features. Flipkart does not. This is like an internal inbox inside the shopping cart portal. The buyer can also attach documents, images with his message to the seller. The message is usually something regarding the product the buyer just purchased from the seller.</p>  <p>Opencart has something called "sms to vendor", which doesn't seem to serve the purpose. Magento might have something similar, but I am unable to find much information about the same.</p>  <p>Guys, your helpful input on this issue would be valued. Thanks in advance!</p>
