<p>I have been using </p>  <pre><code>if ($product-&gt;getRatingSummary()):     echo $this-&gt;getReviewsSummaryHtml($product); endif; </code></pre>  <p>But that returns some HTML for Reviews. Problem is with the variable <strong>$this</strong> which is not accessible inside a function. Is there any way to get the reviews value (Not the whole HTML) without using $this variable and just giving the product id?</p>
