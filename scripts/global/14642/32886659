<p>So Magento "suddenly" gave me this error:</p>  <pre><code>POST https://www.samplesite.nl/ajax/index/add/uenc/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3ZlcnRyZWtâ€¦IyMC5odG1sP19fX1NJRD1VJnN0b3JlPQ,,/product/1383/form_key/f7PMMUeIktiFmSpv/ 404 (Not Found) </code></pre>  <p>I haven't added a plugin or something what-so-ever it just suddenly appeared. So what I understand out of <a href="http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/16586/magento-ajax-add-to-cart-button-error">this</a> question is, that the link is incorrect. Unfortunately, I have very little knowledge of Magento. I did not understand how to fix this from <a href="http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/16586/magento-ajax-add-to-cart-button-error">that</a> question. <br> So how do I fix this? Where is the file located? What code needs to be altered to fix this?<br> Or maybe another solution?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
