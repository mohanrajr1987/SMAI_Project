<p>So as I understood if you change URL of something in Magento, an entry in <code>core_url_rewrite</code> table is created which redirects new url to previous url. Each time the URL is changed, rewrites are appended, not replaced. If URL of something is changed 100 times, there will be 100 chained rewrites in <code>core_url_rewrite</code>. </p>  <p>First of all correct me if I'm wrong please. Secondly, what problems would there be if all links in the middle of all redirect chains were removed, leaving only the first link and the last link? Has anyone done it, was it worth it, were you using any existing scripts and what were the results?</p>
