<p>I am user of Magento . When I enter the credentials of Magento admin panel username and password it shows again one login popup form and while closing it shows "401-Authorization required"-This server could not verify that you are authorized to access the document requested. Either you supplied the wrong credentials (e.g., bad password), or your browser doesn't understand how to supply the credentials required. Please can anyone help me to resolve this issue.</p>
