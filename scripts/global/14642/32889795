<p>I am setting up a Magento install for REST API access. Oauth is installed on the server and i have setup the roles/consumers etc within Magento.</p>  <p>I am using the sample code from <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/m1x/api/rest/introduction.html#RESTAPIIntroduction-CreateasimpleproductasanAdminuserwithOAuthauthentication" rel="nofollow">http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/m1x/api/rest/introduction.html#RESTAPIIntroduction-CreateasimpleproductasanAdminuserwithOAuthauthentication</a> to retrieve a list of products.</p>  <p>When i run this (with the relevant consumer keys) it correctly asks me to login and then once logged in it asks me to authorise the app which is all correct. However after authorising the app i am redirected to the callbackurl with no errors.</p>  <p>It's a stupid question i'm sure but what needs to be included in the callbackurl file as it's loading it fine but this means it never reaches the final else statement to actually list the products. I cannot find reference anywhere what should be included or how i complete this last step to allow access?</p>  <p>Any pointers would be massively appreciated!</p>  <p>Cheers,</p>  <p>Dave</p>
