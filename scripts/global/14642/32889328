<p>I am trying to implement a new currency called "points" into my magento (CE 1.9.2.1) installation. I already installed this currency with my module and an installer script, marked it as allowed and I am possible to switch between "EUR" and "Points" in the frontend.</p>  <p>Here's the trick. Magento expects a currency rate for this new currency. But there's no currency rate, so that points can't be converted to EUR and EUR can't be converted to points. These currencies are independent.</p>  <p>The customers who are using this store should have the opportunity to buy this product with</p>  <ul> <li>points (no reward points. you can not earn points by buying a product) OR</li> <li>EUR.</li> </ul>  <p>Therefore I'd like to know if there is a possibility to</p>  <ul> <li>Display multiple currencies for products (Available for 5.00€ or 200 Points)</li> <li>Add a field in the admin product view (Price (€); Points). This field "points" has to be connected with my installed currency "points".</li> </ul>  <p>Do you have any ideas how to implement this? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
