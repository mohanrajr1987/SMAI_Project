<p>How can I capture the event of creation of a Magento store? I want to launch some script after creating the new store, then view it in Magento. I found out that <code>app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/System/StoreController.php</code> is controlling this. I copied this file to   <code>app/code/local/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/System/StoreController.php</code> with my  changes, but I can't do anything.</p>  <p>I have tried adding new fields in <code>app/code/local/Mage/Adminhtml/Block/System/Store/Edit/Form.php</code> and it works. I wrote <code>Mage::log('smth');</code> there, and see some text in Magento log file, but when I do the same changes to the controller, nothing happens.</p>  <p>How I can solve it ?</p>
