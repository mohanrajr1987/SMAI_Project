<p>I like to build a digital audio store with magento like Beatport or Juno download. The problem is to implement the audio player into the footer of the shop. I managed to get the file, cover etc via ajax out of the DB to shoot them into the audioplayer. But when i click on the navigation to load a new page or category the player stops playing. Is it possible to load the shop contents via ajax?</p>  <p>I tried to load the Shop into an iframe but this is not a good solution</p>  <p>I need help :(</p>
