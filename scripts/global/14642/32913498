<p>I've inserted a personalized option to my configurable product, importing it with magmi.  The description is like that:</p>  <pre><code>- Option Name &lt;small&gt;option explanation&lt;/small&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In the product page, it's all ok, but when I go to the cart, to the bill and all other documents, the html is visible.. So I see the  tag... There's a way to make it disappear?  Thank you! </p>
