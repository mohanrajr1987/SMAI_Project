<p>I am looking to remove the "-" in our SKU's when a customer purchases a product that has a custom option.</p>  <p>For example they buy a shirt and choose custom option size 28</p>  <p>The SKU in the order becomes shirt-28 </p>  <p>We need it to become instead shirt28</p>  <p>I think I am supposed to edit </p>  <pre><code>/app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Catalog/ProductController.php </code></pre>  <p>but cannot identify the line.</p>  <p>Thanks in advanced.</p>  <p>James</p>
