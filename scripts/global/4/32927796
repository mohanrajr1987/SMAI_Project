<p>I'm crafting a personal website, and i want this effect on the example footer:</p>  <p><a href="http://themeforest.net/item/unicum-one-page-creative-html-template/full_screen_preview/12714370" rel="nofollow">http://themeforest.net/item/unicum-one-page-creative-html-template/full_screen_preview/12714370</a></p>  <p>Where the content reaches the end, its like the footer was walways behind everything.</p>  <p>i want a simpler solution, no need to hide the menu or something like that, so i'm trying to make a working model, and i made this:</p>  <pre><code>first{     width:100%;     height:500px;     background:#FF0004;     position:relative;     z-index:2; }  second{     width:100%;     height:500px;     background:none;     position:relative;     z-index:2 }  third{     width:100%;     height:500px;     background:none;     position:fixed;     z-index:1;     font-size:20px; } </code></pre>  <p>In my example, the third div was always there fixed and under everything, so i add the second div whitout bg but same height/width to push the first up and the third show up, but i coulnd get the desired effect. any help? thanks in advance</p>
