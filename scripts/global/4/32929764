<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/1qja7n9j/1" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/1qja7n9j/1</a> (it doesn't seem to work in the result pane, and I'm not sure why, but it works in Netbeans with the head section that was commented out for jsfiddle's sake)</p>  <p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong for the big box movement which makes the small box move much further than lines 25/26 in JS would suggest. Is this a problem of some values not being updated frequently enough? With minute pixel changes triggering the debugger, I can't accurately debug this in Chrome going step by step because problems only occur once the small box passes the right or bottom sides by more than 50% of its width/height. Once in that situation, the left box exponentially gets further away by some reason I just can't see in the code.</p>  <p>The problem is in this particular function:</p>  <p><code>function clickAndDrag(e) {     littleBox.style.top = (e.clientY - littleBox.offsetHeight / 2) + "px";     littleBox.style.left = (e.clientX - littleBox.offsetWidth / 2) + "px";     var littleLeft = littleBox.offsetLeft;     var littleRight = littleBox.offsetLeft + littleBox.offsetWidth;     var littleTop = littleBox.offsetTop;     var littleBottom = littleBox.offsetTop + littleBox.offsetHeight;     var bigLeft = bigBox.offsetLeft;     var bigRight = bigBox.offsetLeft + bigBox.offsetWidth;     var bigTop = bigBox.offsetTop;     var bigBottom = bigBox.offsetTop + bigBox.offsetHeight;     if (mouseIsDown == true) {         if (littleLeft &lt; bigLeft) {             //left boundary             bigBox.style.left = littleLeft + "px";         } else if (bigRight &lt; littleRight) {             //right boundary             bigBox.style.left = littleRight - bigBox.offsetWidth + "px";         }         if (littleTop &lt; bigTop) {             //top boundary             bigBox.style.top = littleTop + "px";         } else if (littleBottom &gt; bigBottom) {             //bottom boundary             bigBox.style.top = littleBottom - bigBox.offsetHeight + "px";         }     } }</code></p>
