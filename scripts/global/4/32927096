<p><br>So I have a question... Hi and thank you for reading: <br>I'm using "Responsive Flickr Gallery", or "RFG" in wordpress, and I'm trying to achieve a zoom/scale on hover image.</p>  <p>As in: When you hover over a image in the gallery, said image will scale x2 times and I'm using this:</p>  <pre><code>img.rfg-img:hover {     opacity: 1;     transform: scale(2); } </code></pre>  <p>This totally works.</p>  <p>However: It's as if each image is on an own layer. When I hover over image 1, it's "beneath" the other images.</p>  <p>When I hover over image 18, however, it's "above" every other images. I want all of the pictures to act image 18 (last picture on page 1).</p>  <p>I'm guessing you have to make a div appear on top of another or something, somehow, and I have no idea how to do that.</p>  <p>Can I use CSS to do this? Is it even possible?</p>  <p>Here's a link:</p>  <p><a href="http://beautifiedbyelsa.se/wordpress/galleri1/" rel="nofollow">http://beautifiedbyelsa.se/wordpress/galleri1/</a></p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>  <p>Regards,</p>
