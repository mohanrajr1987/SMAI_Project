<p>I've created a blog site that (for now) is strictly written in HTML and CSS.  On the Home page I'd like to be able to create links to additional blog articles on the Archive page - not just links to the Archive page but to specific blog articles but I'm not sure how to do that.  Any help appreciated  Thanks. </p>
