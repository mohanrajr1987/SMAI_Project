<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/peipe.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/peipe.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I am using <a href="http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/" rel="nofollow">jquery-tokeninput library</a> and creating custom tokens inside a text box. I have a weird requirement where I want to show, <code>bootstrap popover</code> in the remaining part of the textbox after/during tokens are entered. It will show up when you hover over inside the text box white space after the tokens.</p>  <p>My initial idea for this is to, use an empty div inside the textbox and use a popover on that. Not sure if that is the right approach. But again the popover will be attached to one point in the div.</p>  <p>I am not attaching any code because here its more to do with approach than code.</p>
