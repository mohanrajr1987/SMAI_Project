<p>Our app is a cross-platform application we develop with .NET/Mono on the backend and Silverlight4 on the front end.</p>  <p>The Silverlight UI is hosted in WinForms on Windows and NSWindow on Mac. I was trying to use the Silverlight WebBrowser to load our website, sign in, and access cookies so I can make subsequent call to our web service.</p>  <p>But the WebBrowser control would just show a message that its intended for use in a out-of-browser application or in a in-browser trusted application.</p>  <p>Is there a way I can use the WebBrowser control in the scenario I describe. How can I make the WebBrowser control see that our app is running out-of-browser?</p>  <p>If I get past that issue, is there a way for me to access the cookies from the WebBrowser control?</p>
