<p>I am trying to deserialize JSON from a Web service to a complex object in Silverlight using the DataContractJsonSerializer. When the JSON data is minimal, I am having no issues but when the data is large, I am getting SerializationException with the message " <em>' is not a valid JSON primitive. This error can also occur when extraneous data is present after the JSON data.</em>"</p>  <pre><code>DataContractJsonSerializer jsonSerializer = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(MyComplexObject));  MyComplexObject object= (MyComplexObject)jsonSerializer.ReadObject(e.Result); </code></pre>  <p>How do I get around this error without having to limit the size of JSON data transferred</p>
