<p>I have inherited a WCF RIA, Silverlight 4 application that has been dormant for a few years. It is assumed that the code is stable. To get it working I need to install dependencies which were not documented, as far as I can tell.</p>  <p>After installing dependencies based on what information I could gather I am left with the following error.    </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Operation named 'namereplaced' does not conform to the required   signature. Parameter types must be an entity type or one of the   predefined serializable types</p> </blockquote>  <p>I already tried uninstalling Ria Services as recommended here. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8848922/wcf-ria-operation-does-not-conform-to-the-required-signature">WCF Ria Operation does not conform to the required signature</a> but this leads to more errors.</p>  <p>I've also tried hunting down a specific version of the Ria Services Toolkit as suggest here, but no luck <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/silverlight/en-US/86f40859-18e8-4ce6-8d8a-a864fbe4e3ac/error-operation-named-createuser-does-not-conform-to-the-required-signature-parameter-types?forum=silverlightwcf" rel="nofollow">https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/silverlight/en-US/86f40859-18e8-4ce6-8d8a-a864fbe4e3ac/error-operation-named-createuser-does-not-conform-to-the-required-signature-parameter-types?forum=silverlightwcf</a></p>  <p>Additionally, I tried setting up a drop retrieved from the client's FTP in IIS and saw the following in the machine Event Log </p>  <blockquote>   <p>: The service   '/AppName/Services/SomeManager-Web-Services-ImportService.svc' cannot   be activated due to an exception during compilation.  The exception   message is: Operation named 'namereplaced' does not conform to the   required signature. Parameter types must be an entity or complex type,   a collection of complex types, or one of the predefined serializable   types.. ---> System.InvalidOperationException: Operation named   'namereplaced' does not conform to the required signature. Parameter   types must be an entity or complex type, a collection of complex   types, or one of the predefined serializable types.</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, using an old installer that the IT team found in the old developers files, I was able to set up an instance of the website which does not generate these errors, but is incompatible with the latest version of the database. I haven't found the source for the setup project in source control.</p>  <p>The method in question is defined as follows</p>  <pre><code> [Invoke(HasSideEffects=true)]     public void NameReplaced(IEnumerable&lt;ImportRecord&gt; recs)     {         foreach (var item in recs)         {             UpdateImportRecord(item);         }     } </code></pre>  <p>I'd ideally like to resolve this without trying to change the code as an investigation needs to be done on an error in the clients environment, then further updates are required.</p>  <p>EDIT:  Included suggestion from Mark W, </p>  <pre><code> public IQueryable&lt;ImportRecord&gt; GetImportRecords()         {             return null;         } </code></pre>  <p>but the same build error is reported.</p>
