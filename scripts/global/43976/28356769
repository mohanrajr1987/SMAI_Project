<p>I am trying to recognize a MouseLeftButtonDown on every cell in a DataGrid, however two things are stopping me:</p>  <ul> <li>DataGridCell doesn't fire click events</li> <li>Using a grid (with click event) as the child element won't fill the cell, and therefore is only clickable on its content which it auto-sizes itself to fit.</li> </ul>  <p>Here's my cell template:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="..."&gt;     &lt;Grid MouseLeftButtonDown="..."           VerticalAlignment="Stretch"           HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"&gt;         &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;             &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*"/&gt;         &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;         &lt;Image     HorizontalAlignment="Center"                    VerticalAlignment="Center"                    Width="24" Height="24"                    Source="..."/&gt;     &lt;/Grid&gt;     &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Row heights/column widths mean a cell is 64px high and 80px wide, and resizable, so the 24x24 image inside is the only clickable portion in a potentially large cell. The DataGridCell itself is styled as follows:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;Style TargetType="data:DataGridCell" x:Key="..."&gt;       &lt;Setter Property="Height" Value="64"/&gt;       &lt;Setter Property="HorizontalContentAlignment" Value="Stretch"/&gt;       &lt;Setter Property="VerticalContentAlignment" Value="Stretch"/&gt;     &lt;/Style&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Ideally, the grid should expand to the size of the containing cell. But no matter how many times I assign the alignment properties to stretch, it won't. You can see by setting the Grid's background. It fits to its content, no more.</p>  <p>I have managed to hack together a solution by placing transparent Canvas elements in columns 0 and 2 and setting a column maxwidth, but I feel like there must be a better way.</p>
