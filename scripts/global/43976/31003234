<p>I face some strange issue in Silverlight 5 on machine which use window 7.</p>  <p>I have a Silverlight app and after deploying it, it works fine on all user machine but on some of user machine it does not working.</p>  <p>For Example My Username : Test and password is Test.</p>  <p>Now when I use this info to login my app on my machine and also some of other machine then it works fine but when I use same info on other machine (Window 7) it does not work.</p>  <p>I have set mesg for invalid login info in wcf service and return mesg to user. I found that when I use invalid logininfo then it display mesg which I set in wcf method.</p>  <p>I also uninstall old Silverlight and install new on window 7 machine but then also not working.</p>  <p>I think there are something which block to response of wcf service. I am stuck into this issue.</p>  <p>Thanks, Hitesh </p>
