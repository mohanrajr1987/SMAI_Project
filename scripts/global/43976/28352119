<p>I want to try out something not sure if it is possible, i'll just put forward what i have in mind:</p>  <p>I am trying to create an OOB silverlight application which talks to multiple WCF services and all of which will be present in one system, what i finally want to do with this is to run this application in my own system without having to connect to internet or start the WCF service separately. And finally create an installable to install this application which will contain WCF service as well. Is there a way to do it?</p>
