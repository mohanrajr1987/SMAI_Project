<p>I have a DataGrid that contains only one row and that row contains an image. I have set the MaxHeight of DataGrid so that the vertical scrollbar of grid appears. Now when I click on the thumbs of vertical scrollbar, it either takes me to the bottom of the grid or to the top.It does not come in midway or any other position because it contains a single row.</p>  <p>Can anyone please suggest how can I control this scroll behavior manually so that it should not jump to either extremes instead it should behave like a normal scrollbar does.</p>
