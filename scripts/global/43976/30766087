<p>I'm doing a small silverlight application on visual studio 2012. When I tried to debug the program it shows an error message saying:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Unable to attach. Microsoft Visual Studio Debugging Monitor(MSVSMON.EXE) failed to start. If this problem persists, please repair your Visual Studio installation via 'Add or Remove Programs' in Control Panel."</p> </blockquote>  <p>I repaired Visual Studio but the error still occurs. And I searched everywhere and everything but didn't work anything. Can you please help me to get rid of this? Thank you.</p>
