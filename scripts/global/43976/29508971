<p>I know silverlight is outdated and Microsoft it self has shutdown further development on it. However I came across one strange &amp; security issue. </p>  <p>Understand the following scenario :   I have my silverlight application up &amp; running on hosted server and there are approx 500 user who are using it same time with application version around <strong>192.3XXXX</strong>. </p>  <p>Later on I have developed some crucial business functionality and released application on server with version around <strong>192.4XXXX</strong>. Next day all 500 user are working on application version <strong>192.4XXXX</strong>. and on same day I found that I have made some serious mistake &amp; I have to fix it as soon as possible. so i have applied the fix and released the Application on server with version around 192.5XXXX.</p>  <p>Now here come my Question. How can i enforce this 500 user to use <strong>192.5XXXX</strong> at same time. I can not tell each user to reload the app and some of may misuse the application's functionality (as earlier mention, some serious mistake i made in code like showing confrontational data on some form etc. ) </p>  <p>Any suggestion or idea to overcome such situation. Or something like that i can manege from server to force client reload app and download new version.</p>  <p>Thx in advance. </p>
