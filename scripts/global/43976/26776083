<p>I would like to get the control that binds to a specific (Observable) property.</p>  <p>I found an SO answer similar to exactly what I want but the solution is for WPF:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3959421/wpf-find-control-that-binds-to-specific-property">WPF. Find control that binds to specific property</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately, I cannot reference the WindowsBase.dll assembly that defines the <strong>MarkupObject</strong> and the <strong>MarkupWriter</strong>.</p>  <p>It results in the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You can't add a reference to WindowsBase.dll as it was not built   against the Silverlight runtime. Silverlight projects will only work   with Silvelight assemblies.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is there an equivalent way I can do the same for Silverlight?</p>
