<p>My Windows 8.1 development PC is having trouble loading my Silverlight 4 app, which is hosted inside of an MVC 3 website. I am able to log in to the website just fine, which uses ASP.NET's authentication framework, but when the browser attempts to load the Silverlight XAP file, it gets a 302 redirect back to the login page.</p>  <p>I suspect there is a problem with my IIS configuration, but I am stumped. Any hints or tips would be very much appreciated.</p>
