<p>For version management purposes, I need to increase the version of the assembly file to verify the release version. The issue here is that if I increase the file assembly version, other referenced projects where that assembly is used are getting failures, because of the version mismatch.</p>  <p>I am unable to make out what is the proper way to manage the version of assembly files in such a case.</p>  <p>Any suggestions or guidance here is appreciated.</p>
