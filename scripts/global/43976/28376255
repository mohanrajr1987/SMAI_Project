<p>I bring a decimal value from SQL Server to a Silverlight app (c#) and do an excel export. </p>  <p>In Silverlight, I have the data column defined as a decimal and then export that data into an excel spreadsheet. </p>  <p>If the value is NULL (from DB), it converts the value to 0 in the excel. In this case, if the value is NULL, I want the excel to show a blank instead of 0. </p>  <p>Is it the case that Excel does not accept a NULL value and therefore, by default, converts the value into either a blank (if string datatype) or a 0 (if number datatype)?</p>  <p>My fix thus far is to make datatype in Silverlight a string. Thus for NULL values, it outputs a blank. </p>  <p>Is there a better way to handle this conversion for NULL values? </p>
