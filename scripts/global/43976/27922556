<p>I have a silverlight application in which I have a map control.  I want to save the map into a jpg/png file format to the disk. </p>  <p>I got this link <a href="http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Capturing-a-Silverlight-Screen.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Capturing-a-Silverlight-Screen.aspx</a> but it uses some third party library to save the WriteableBitmap into the file/disk. I do not want to use any third party control. Is there any standard .Net API/way to save the image capture to the disk?</p>  <p>Atul Sureka</p>
