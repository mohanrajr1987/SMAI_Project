<p>I have a complex Silverlight 4 application with high RIA Services usage. Usually application works without any errors, however occasionally I get strange errors. </p>  <p>The most popular is <em>"The type 'XXX' has been mapped more than once."</em></p>  <p>There are two more that I get less often:</p>  <p><em>Invalid Include specification for member XXX. Non-projection includes can only be specified on members with the AssociationAttribute applied.</em></p>  <p><em>The ItemCollection for the 'OCSpace' space has already been registered.</em></p>  <p>Where XXX is a type from my database model. They may be different with every error. But I have no idea what is OCSpace.</p>  <p>I suspected issues with async ObjectContext calling because many RIA calls running approximately simultaneously, however disabling some of them did not really help.</p>
