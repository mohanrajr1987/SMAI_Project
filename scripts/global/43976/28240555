<p>I am using Silverlight 4 and DevForce 6.1.11.0</p>  <p>I have some POCO classes that implement EntityAspect.</p>  <p>When changes are saved via EntityManager.SaveChanges; DevForce does not save these POCO entities to the server, because these POCO entities are not part of EF. </p>  <p>Instead I send them to a webservice via WebClient.UploadStringAsync.</p>  <p>This works, expect when I am saving more than one entity of the same type. Then I get this exception:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>EntityManagerSaveException: An entity with this key: PocoMyClass: 0,0   already exists in this entityManager</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have checked the cache, and there is no entity with that key.</p>  <p>The WebClient.UploadStringAsync still sends the data and everything gets saved, but the exception does not look good to customers.</p>  <p>How do I work around this exception?</p>
