<p>I have a silverlight application. The page has a grid with multiple controls into it in different columns and rows. some controls are overlapping.</p>  <p>I wanted to save the screenshot of the grid to an image. I am able to do that using writeablebitmap &amp; ImageTools class. In the constructor I have to pass the UI element(Grid).</p>  <p>But it includes all the controls of the grid, I do not want some of them. Is there any way I can select the list of childrens which needs to be saved to the image. Or I can pass multiple UIElements to writeablebitmap?</p>  <p>Atul Sureka</p>
