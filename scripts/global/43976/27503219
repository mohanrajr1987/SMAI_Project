<p>I have a silverlight date picker declared like below</p>  <pre><code>&lt;controls:DatePicker  x:Name="DateFrom"  Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="0"&gt;&lt;/controls:DatePicker&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and a button declared as such.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cc:NexButton x:Name="Submit" HorizontalAlignment="Right" Grid.Column="0" Content="Search" MouseLeftButtonUp="NexButton_MouseLeftButtonUp" &gt;&lt;/cc:NexButton&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I type a date in the date picker and press the search button without clicking out of the control It will go to the NexButton_MouseLeftButtonUp event. </p>  <p>When I try and get value out by going DateFrom.Text I get "" and when I try and access its selectedvalue by going DateFrom.SelectedDate I get today's date. Both of these cases are wrong and I should be getting the date entered. I thought it might of been a date validation error so I have tried different date formats such as US and UK date formats.</p>  <p>Why can I not access the date entered when I do not click/ tab out of the control? Is some event failing to fire.</p>
