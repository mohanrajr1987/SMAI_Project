<p>I want to include in a report (e.g., written in a word file) a screen shot from a Silverlight application. The problem is that the image resolution is very bad and the printed result is unsatisfactory when using the print-screen button.</p>  <p>Is there a way to create better screen captures? </p>  <p>Note: I have access to the source code and i can modify the application if needed. The app is written in Silverlight version 4.</p>
