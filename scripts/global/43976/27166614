<p>Could someone explain the use of notify property changed and in which cases should I be using it?</p>  <p>For example: I have in my silverlight application the domain data source which loads data and the event LoadedData where I set to some lists (List) the content of the entities from the domain context and bind the lists to the girds.</p>  <p>Do I need to use NotyfiPropertyChanged on the Lists?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
