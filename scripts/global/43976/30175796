<p>I am working on a web parts for SharePoint using Silverlight and need to create links between these webparts. I need to wear buttons with a WebPart fence to another webpart and I send some data from the first to second, I consulted various documents but have not been very useful, if anyone knows how to do it would greatly appreciate it.</p>
