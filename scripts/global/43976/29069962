<p>I have a web application (ASP.Net) that needs to upload a file</p>  <p>I've been looking for a framework to extract data from excel on the client side and submit the content (JSON, CSV) format into the server side to lessen the traffic. I've looked into ActiveXObject in javascript but it only works in internet explorer. I have an option to use silverlight or actionscript to do the parsing. </p>  <p>Question:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Is silverlight really dead? can't i use it on the long run?</p>      <p>Is this possible using action script?</p>      <p>Is there any javascript framework to do this kind of parsing?</p> </blockquote>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
