<p>I'm working on a silverlight business application at work and I'm wondering what should I be doing in the following scenario :</p>  <p>There's a xaml page which is the main point of working in the application and it uses SQL in the backend to bring data from many tabels and bind it using some logic in 5 different datagrids.</p>  <p>In the front end , there are few data converters which are doing some operation based on the values they get .</p>  <p>It would be better(performance) to move all the 'data converters' logic in the server side or I should be sticking with the converters?</p>
