<p>i am trying to mix/match shaders with OpenGL's shader program pipelines. With separable programs (and thus, pipelines), varyings are matched by location rather than by name. The 'clean' solution would be to set locations from C code but i couldn't find anyway yo do that. glGetProgramResource... allow to get program output locations, but i didn't find how to set them. Is there a way to do that in core ? and if not why is it impossible ?</p>
