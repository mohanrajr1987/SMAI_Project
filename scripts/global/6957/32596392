<p>From <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4414041/what-is-the-precision-of-highp-floats-in-glsl-es-2-0-for-iphone-ipod-touch-ipad">What is the precision of highp floats in GLSL ES 2.0 (for iPhone/iPod touch/iPad)?</a> ... </p>  <p>I get, for instance, on the iPhone 5S, that highp float has a precision of "23". From the documentation (p. 33, section 4.5.2 â€” <a href="https://www.khronos.org/files/opengles_shading_language.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.khronos.org/files/opengles_shading_language.pdf</a> ), I'm interpreting that as "the difference between two floating point numbers is at least 2^-23, which is 1.1920929e-7. But I'm fairly confident I'm not understanding that correctly, because I think I've got it calculating differences that are smaller than that by two or three orders of magnitude (and crapping out beyond that).</p>  <p>Am I just getting lucky with my calculations, or am I misunderstanding the value?</p>
