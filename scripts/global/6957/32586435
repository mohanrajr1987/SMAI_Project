<p>I'm about GStreamer and GLSL, and I want to build a project to view side-by-side stereoscopic sideos with GStreamer and Oculus Rift. There is a <a href="https://lubosz.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/view-side-by-side-stereoscopic-video-with-gstreamer-and-oculus-rift/" rel="nofollow">link</a> talk about this which has a GLSL code in it. But I don't know how to use this code with in GStreamer's code. Could anybody help me ?</p>
