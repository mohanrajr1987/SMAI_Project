<p>When I develop shader code on my machine I often find myself in the situation where the shader works perfectly on my machine, but on other graphic cards, drivers, operating systems, etc. it doesn't.</p>  <p>How to achieve compatibility of shaders?</p>  <p>I see a few approches:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Test on many different systems. But which systems to choose? Testing with every card on every OS and every driver is not realistic. Maybe we can assume that the vendors care for backward compatibility? In this case testing with old cards and drivers might be sufficient.</p></li> <li><p>Ask the driver for a specific version and core profile. This helps a bit, but the drivers seem very lenient, allowing me to code things that aren't in the spec.</p></li> <li><p>Code checkers that check the code for strict compatibility with a certain spec. There don't seen to be such tools around.</p></li> <li><p>Don't bother and wait for bug-reports from users.Yet the error messages generated by the drivers are rather poor, and the observed behaviour might be as un-insightful as a black screen.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I'm targeting Win/Linux/OSX platforms. Not consoles.</p>
