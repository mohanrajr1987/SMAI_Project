<p>Ever since I updated eclipse to Mars it's been having a lot issues, Right now I have an LWJGL program, If I launch it after I just opened eclipse, It works just fine, But if I relaunch it afterwards the program displays black, I haven't even changed the code it just stops working, And if I change the code and undo it and launch then it works, But relaunching again makes it stop working again. WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?!</p>
