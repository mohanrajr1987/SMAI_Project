<p>I was wondering how I could create 2D lights like here:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVlYsGOkkyM" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVlYsGOkkyM</a></p>  <p>And here:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSf1MpsWKig" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSf1MpsWKig</a></p>  <p>The shadows aren't currently in my interest. I tried some things but they don't seem to work. So all I currently have is the fragment and the vertex shader with hardly any stuff in it.</p>
