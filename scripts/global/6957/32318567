<p>I'm trying to use two opengl images, one of which is sparse and the other used as a sort of page table, in which I keep track of the page actually commited.</p>  <p>I have a simple little shader, which looks like this (main not included):</p>  <pre><code>#version 450 core #extension GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store : require  uniform float gridSize; uniform float pageTableSize;  bool isPageInMemoryOrRequest (in ivec3 pos) {     bool returnValue = false;     if ( 255u == imageAtomicExchange(pageTable, pos, 128u) )     {         returnValue = true;     }      return returnValue; } </code></pre>  <p>And my problem is that this won't compile. I keep getting this message: <strong>Error C1115: unable to find compatible overloaded function "imageAtomicExchange(struct uimage3D1x8_bindless, ivec3, uint)"</strong></p>  <p>I'm pretty sure I've never seen that _bindless part anywhere in the specs and I'm not exactly sure how the compiler figures out that is a bindless texture at compile time (or maybe they're all bindless in the latest drivers).</p>  <p>I've got a GTX660TI and I'm using the 352.86 drivers. I'm wondering if anyone's had this sort of issue before and could tell me what might the problem be.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
