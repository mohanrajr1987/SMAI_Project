<p>I am trying to pass a variable timeVar (a float initially set to 0.0) that changes in my display() method with the line </p>  <pre><code>timeVar = time(0); </code></pre>  <p>to my fragment shader. Then I do this </p>  <pre><code>safe_glUniform1f(h_uTime, timeVar);  </code></pre>  <p>and pass it to my shader program like so</p>  <pre><code>h_uTime = safe_glGetAttribLocation(h_program, "uTime"); </code></pre>  <p>But I keep getting this error. Please help!</p>  <pre><code>WARN: uTime cannot be bound (it either doesn't exist or has been optimized  away). safe_glAttrib calls will silently ignore it. </code></pre>
