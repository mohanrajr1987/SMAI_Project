<p>Without feedback, the optimizer might remove outputs from the last vertex processing shader if the fragment shader has no use for them.</p>  <p>Transform Feedback captures those outputs. It it possible that I won't capture all outputs because of this?</p>  <p>Or to phrase it differently, do I have to provide a fragment shader that does something with those values even if I will use the program exclusively to fill a feedback buffer?</p>
