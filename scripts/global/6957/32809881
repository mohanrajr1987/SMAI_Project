<p>I am porting a small OpenGL framework from 3.3 to 4.3. I have shader mix/match implemented in software (ie: shaders are bound individually and programs are linked lazily when a draw call is issued.).</p>  <p>OpenGL 4.1 added this feature with separable programs &amp; pipelines however the point of having programs encapsulating all the shader stages was to be able to optimize them as a whole (and only once).</p>  <p>So I would like to know if using SPOs is slower than standard shader programs on Direct3D 11 hardware. Especially : do current implementations allow you to have one program per shader (so a pipeline with 2-5 separate programs) without significant performance loss ?</p>
