<p>I've currently got 2 files, ones shared script and the others constant script. Shared script calls on constant strings in the constant file and constant file sends these strings back to the shared file. However, I want to password protect these constants so that the constant script only sends back these strings if the code supplies the right constants. My current script for the Shared_Script file is:</p>  <pre><code>'USEUNIT Constants_Script Sub Desktop()   Set Variable = Constants_Script.Cred End Sub </code></pre>  <p>And for my Constant_Script file:</p>  <pre><code>Const Cred = "MyCred" </code></pre>  <p>Thinking of encapsulating this in an if statement but I can't find any way to do this which works </p>
