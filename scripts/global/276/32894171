<p>does anyone know how to replace variable value after a program that changes it? I tried static variable before, but it doesn't save after you close the program.</p>  <p>For example</p>  <pre><code>import java.lang.Math;  public class Main {    static int A1;    public static void main (String [] args) {      A1=(int) (1+Math.random()*10);    }       } </code></pre>  <p>Let's say the first time the program is run, A1 holds a value of 5. Is it possible that next time the program is run, A1 still holds a value of 5 instead of zero? (before reaching the main method)</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
