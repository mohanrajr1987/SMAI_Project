<p>In the R Package - ClustOfVar, there are methods to cluster Variables with Each other. It gives the error as below - </p>  <pre><code>train2 = train[!duplicated(lapply(train, summary))] &gt; tree &lt;- hclustvar(train2[, 2:10]) Error in recodquant(X.quanti) :    There are columns in X.quanti where all the values are identical </code></pre>  <p>From what I understand, to ensure that my Variables are not identical, i have  applied the duplicated logic to remove duplicate variables. </p>  <p>I checked the  package code on <a href="https://github.com/cran/PCAmixdata/blob/master/R/recodquant.R" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cran/PCAmixdata/blob/master/R/recodquant.R</a> but could not identify the mistake.</p>  <p>Any Ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks, Manish</p>
