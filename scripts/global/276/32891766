<p>I would like to create a new categorical variable that measures whether or not a student is a 1st generation university student.</p>  <p>variable X is mother's education 1=less than HS, 2 = HS or GED, 3 = BS/BA, 4 = Masters, 5 = PHD</p>  <p>variable Y is father's education and is measured the same way.</p>  <p>I would like to create variable Z such that if both mother and father have never received anything above their bachelor's or above, then variable Z would be 1, if not variable Z will be 0.</p>  <p>Thanks so much!</p>
