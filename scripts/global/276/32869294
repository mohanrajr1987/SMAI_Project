<p>How would I pass a command line variable though a system() command in c++. I have tried using:</p>  <pre><code>string i; i = system("./findName.sh"); i += argv[1]; cout &lt;&lt; i; </code></pre>  <p>But when  i run this it gives me my condition for wrong number of arguments i have written in my shell script.</p>  <p>This is the output I received when running my program with "./findName brandonw". Which is my executable file ran with the argument i want my shell script to run with.</p>  <pre><code>The arguments you put are: brandonw usage: findName.sh [only_one_argument] </code></pre>
