<p>So I'm editing a source code for a game, and I have an event reading the game's chat. I need the game to read the chat, copy some words from the chat, enter a chat message with the first word, wait a bit, enter a chat message with the second word etc. Right now, the code looks like that:</p>  <pre><code>private final long PERIOD = 4000L; //timer private long lastTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - PERIOD;  @SubscribeEvent     public void onChat(final ClientChatReceivedEvent e) { //look at the chat         final String chat = e.message.getUnformattedText();            if(chat.startsWith("Something")) { //if the chat message starts with "Something"                 //Create the string chatp1 being "Something 123"                 String click = chatp1.replace("Something ", ""); //Creates a string "click", which is chatp1 without the "Something ", so it's "123" //After it basically does the same thing multiple times, but instead of "Something" it's "Something1" and instead of "123" it's "124" etc. //Then I need to run the commands MyGame.getMyGame().thePlayer.sendChatMessage("/Command " + click); //runs the command "/Command 123"           long thisTime12 = System.currentTimeMillis();             if ((thisTime12 - lastTime) &gt;= PERIOD) { //waits                     lastTime = thisTime12; MyGame.getMyGame().thePlayer.sendChatMessage("/Command " + click2); //Runs the command "/Command 124" //etc. </code></pre>  <p>Now there's a problem: "click" and "click2" can not be found, which is obvious: these are local variables, not global ones. My question is: what is the easiest way of changing the code so "click" and "click2" can be found in the code? Should I claim them as global variables at the beginning (if so, how?) or something else?</p>
