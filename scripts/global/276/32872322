<p>Here is my include file <code>data.php</code>:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php     $name = "Noob"; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This file is in my local server as well as my online server.</p>  <p>And here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php     //include("./data.php");     //include("http://localhost/webdev/test/php/remote_include/data.php");     //include("http://example.com/data.php");      echo "Hello $name."; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now, in the 3 commented lines, the first line works, and <code>Hello Noob.</code> is printed. But the next 2 lines do not work and <code>Hello .</code> is printed.</p>  <p>Why?</p>  <p>My guess is, when I include using <code>http</code>, the PHP file actually gets run and thus the main script (which calls the include) does not know which variables are set and can only see what PHP prints. Is that correct? If that's the case, say my <code>data.php</code> file (which is in my online server) has top secret database information of my awesome (noob) blog site. So someone cannot just <code>include()</code> my file (using <code>http</code> or any other possible method) and get the database info by echoing the variables?</p>  <p>Sorry if it's too noob of a question and has been asked before.</p>
