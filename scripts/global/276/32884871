<p>I have a common class in my Data Access layer, where i am declaring stored procedure names as static variables for e.g. </p>  <pre><code>  public static string USP_TestAPP = "dbo.USP_TestAPP" </code></pre>  <p>Now i am refering this variable in my methods where i want to fetch data from DB. </p>  <p>My questions are that, </p>  <ol> <li>How asp.net will manage memeory for this variable? </li> <li>When bvariable will be initialised for different requests?</li> <li>Once variable is initialised then when system will clear the memory for this variable</li> <li>How much copies of static variable will be created by server for different request?</li> </ol>
