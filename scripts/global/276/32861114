<p>I would like to know how to access to the content of a html element using PHP. The  explanation is as below:</p>  <p>This is my html code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="edittitle" title="Editing title"&gt; &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Actually, What I want is accessing to the content of the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag (which is "1") using PHP and putting it in a PHP variable. Is there any idea about how to do that?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
