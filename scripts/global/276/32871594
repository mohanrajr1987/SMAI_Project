<p>I am trying to set an environment variable on a Mac at boot time. I want the variable to exist even if nobody is logged in. This is because I may use ARD to launch a script remotely (as root) and I need to query these variables.</p>  <p>I can create a <em>PLIST</em> in the <em>LaunchDaemons</em> folder that will perform <em>launchctl</em> command, but this doesn't seem to set the variable for the script that is launched remotely as root (whether someone is logged in or not). However, if a user logs in, it does work for that user.</p>  <pre><code>launchctl setenv ENVNAME ENVVALUE </code></pre>  <p>Information I have found on this (such as <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106355/setting-the-system-wide-path-environment-variable-in-mavericks">http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106355/setting-the-system-wide-path-environment-variable-in-mavericks</a>) suggests that it can only be in a user context, on login.</p>  <p>Is anyone aware of a way that a variable can be set so it exists when the <strong>machine is booted</strong>?</p>  <p>I have found details that are out of date for 10.10 (such as using the .profile or bashrc) which may have helped previously (but I can't be sure).</p>
