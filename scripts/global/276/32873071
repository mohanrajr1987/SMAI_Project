<p>Ie:  If cell A10 is "fish" and B13 is 10 and C20 is 6 then the output should find a value from a list of possible values(ie a column of output values).  However, A10 could be 4 variables, and B13 could be 10 variables and C20 could be 6 variables and the output will be unique for each combination. (not a calculation.) How can I do this?</p>  <p>Would I have to create a table of all possible combos somehow such that I would have 240 rows of combinations with each one having a value in the adjacent column that matches that combo?</p>  <p>Think to this example.  If a car is 4wd, and its blue and it has a sunroof it'll cost $30,000 (output 30,000) If it's red with other variables as shown, then it's $29,000.</p>  <p>How can I set that up please?</p>
