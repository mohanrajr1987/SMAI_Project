<h3>1) Declaration</h3>  <p>I have pairs of, for example, directories. The pairs contain spaces (and/or other inconveniences like extra periods or special chars. Anything ext4 easily supports let say.) </p>  <pre><code>'/foo/dolor sit/amet.elit'         '/bar/accumsan/luctus massa.nec' '/baz/sagittis. Fusce/vitae.dolor' '/bam/Nunc aliquetjusto.metus' </code></pre>  <p>I want to write a bash script where these pairs are hard-coded/constants.</p>  <p>I would highly prefer declaring the strings within a delimiter or such that does not need the arbitrary string to be preprocessed (eg I don't want to add escapes on all literal whitespaces if possible)</p>  <hr>  <h3>2) Iteration</h3>  <p>With declared pairs of strings, I wish to enter a loop where both the strings are available in one iteration as separate variables, e.g. <code>$LEFT</code> and <code>$RIGHT</code>.</p>  <p>Likely uses being simple file operations like copy, move, link, diff.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Notes:</em></p>  <ul> <li>The "height" of the array should allow many many pairs.</li> <li>If the declaration and iteration can support wider-than-2 2D arrays please note how to extend to desired with.</li> <li>If bash has an "array" specific datatype, its use is not mandatory to the question/answer. Any iterable 2-dimensional declaration and iteration is sufficient.</li> </ul>
