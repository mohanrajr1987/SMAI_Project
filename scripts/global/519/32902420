<p>Im trying to make a 360 video player in android similar to youtube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQd41nbQM-U" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQd41nbQM-U</a>). I couldn't find any tutorials on how to play a flattened video in a spherical view to make it look like a 360 video. Can someone please point me in right direction? I prefer native player but html5 player would be fine too.</p>
