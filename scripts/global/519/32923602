<p>I am using web2py for my college project.</p>  <p>I have managed to upload a video into my database (by uploading it into 'uploads files'). </p>  <p>But the problem is I don't know how to access that uploaded video afterwards.</p>  <p>Can someone explain me how can I access a video after it has been uploaded?</p>  <p>The intention is that user can see their videos and download them.</p>  <pre><code>db.define_table('product',Field('TITLE',requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),             Field('OWNER_ID','reference auth_user',readable=False,),             Field('Vide0','upload'),             Field('DESCRIPTION','text'),             Field('times','datetime'),             Field('RATE')             ) </code></pre>
