<p>I have embedded videos on my moodle, which play in sequence - once you have watched one you can watch the next one. However, the sessions do not seem to work correctly as even if you have watched all of them, them go back to the first one, and then back to, let's say third one, you cannot do so without watching all the videos in-between. I am wondering if this is a bug on moodle or if there is a way around it. </p>
