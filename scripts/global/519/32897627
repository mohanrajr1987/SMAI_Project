<p>I am using the <code>progress</code> event to monitor an html5 video element on my site. I need to make sure the entire video has loaded before I allow interaction as the video consists of transitions.</p>  <p>My home page has a video, my secondary pages do not.</p>  <p>I have all of this working properly.</p>  <p>My objective is once I have loaded the video, go to an interior page and come back, is there a way to not force the user to wait until 100% loaded?</p>  <p>Coming from the good-ol flash days, I didn't need to preload the swf file each time if the file was already loaded once. </p>  <p><strong>html</strong></p>  <pre><code> &lt;video id="myVideo" autobuffer="true" autoplay="false" preload="auto"&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>jQuery</strong></p>  <pre><code>var video = document.getElementById('myVideo'); video.addEventListener('progress', onUpdateProgress, false); </code></pre>
