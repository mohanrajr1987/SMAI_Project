<p>Have you ever watched any of google's explanatory whiteboard videos, like "inside search"? How do they make these kind of catchy, impressive animation videos? Do they use their own tool? I've heard online tools like powtoon, animaker etc., those videos dont have that simple impressing quality. Does anyone know about how google makes these kind of animation videos?? </p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TYHCeUfoAnw" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/TYHCeUfoAnw</a></p>
