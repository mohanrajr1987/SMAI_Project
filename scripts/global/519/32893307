<p>I've implemented an HTML5 video as a full screen background video. Each time someone opens the page or refreshes it, I'd like to have the background video randomly change to another one (I'll have about 3 or 4 videos that could be chosen.) Until the page is refreshed or reopened just that one video would play, though. It wouldn't loop through the 3 or 4 videos if that makes sense.</p>  <p>This question was flagged as a duplicate for another, which gave me part of the answer.</p>  <pre><code>var videoList = ["video1", "video2", "video3", "video4", "video5"]; videoList.sort(function (a, b) { return Math.random() &gt; 0.5 ? -1 : 1; </code></pre>  <p>My question now is, how do I 'tie' these video files to the source of the html video?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;video autoplay  poster="" id="bgvid" loop&gt;     &lt;source src="?" type="video/webm"&gt;     &lt;source src="?" type="video/mp4"&gt; &lt;/video&gt; </code></pre>
