<p>I am currently trying to record a video in square shape and create a output as .mp4. It seems to be really challenging. I tried diffrent approches including: OnPreviewFrame and FFMpeg. But never got a satisfing result. Today i found Grafika. And it seems to be the right way. But because of the complextity of the Code i am stuck now. Using the Example: CameraCaptureActivity.java i managed to record a video. But its shape is rectangluar and not square. Furthermore the camera is rotated by 90 degrees.  I was already trying to manipulate certain parameters but never got a good video. Some where squeezed and so on.</p>  <p>Does anybody know what parameters i need to change inside Grafikas example to get the right result?  In the end the camera of my android phone should record Videos like Vine or Instagram.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
