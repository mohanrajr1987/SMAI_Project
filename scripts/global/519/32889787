<p>I have a video featured on my home page <a href="http://www.challenge-the-box.com" rel="nofollow">Click Here</a>, however it will drive my visitors nuts if it plays every single time they visit. How can I go about getting it to play for the first time they visit? The theme's developers said it will involve a lot of code and wouldn't assist me further. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
