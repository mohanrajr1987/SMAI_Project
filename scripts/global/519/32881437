<p>I'm, developing an iOS 9 app which works like a video kiosk. Users can tap on an iPad and a video should be displayed on a connected 1080p screen.</p>  <p>I've tried this answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4621293/how-to-output-video-on-external-display-with-controls-on-ipad">here</a> but it looks pretty outdated and isn't working any more.</p>  <p>From the Apple Developer Documentation, the AVPlayer looks like the right library to use. In former projects I've used MPMoviePlayer but this API seems to be deprecated in iOS9.</p>  <p>Is the AVPlayer the right way to go and do I need to handle the external display specifically or is this handled by iOS / Airplay.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance  chris</p>
