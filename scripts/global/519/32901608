<p>I have uploaded a video using html5 video tag and it seems to display like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o3Qby.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o3Qby.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I need to fix the video width with the upper and lower bar widths, but here I am getting problem with <code>user agent stylesheet</code>(browser's default css). How can I get rid off it?</p>
