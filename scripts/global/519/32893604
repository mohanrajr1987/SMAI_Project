<p>I tried to play a HTTPS html5 video on mobile, But Can't play it.</p>  <p>Please confirm it, HTTPS video url is not supported for mobile html5?</p>  <p>I've checked and found Youtube is also using HTTP for mobile streaming.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;video width="320" height="240" controls&gt;   &lt;source src="https://domain/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt; Your browser does not support the video tag. &lt;/video&gt; </code></pre>
