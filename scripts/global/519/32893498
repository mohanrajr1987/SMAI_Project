<p>I am working on a personal project in which video broadcasting is a pivotal feature (think in Periscope or Meerkat). However, it is not clear to me what do involve to implement such feature and what do I need to learn also.</p>  <p>I am asking for help to get an intuition (big picture) about which are the fundamental concepts behind this piece of software.</p>  <ul> <li><p>How should the video broadcast sent to a web server?. I suspect that this do not work in the same way that file upload do (using a multi part form).</p></li> <li><p>Is required a connection using sockets?</p></li> <li><p>How should the server expose the broadcast at the same time its receiving it?.</p></li> <li><p>Can something like this be done by a small team (3 - 5) or should I look for paid services that can solve this problem?</p></li> </ul>  <p>In the past, I have built many web applications so I am aware of most of the required components of them (HTTP request/response cycle, basic security, REST API, data bases, cache, etc.), however, I have never dealt with an application of this kind.</p>
