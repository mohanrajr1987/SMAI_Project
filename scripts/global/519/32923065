<p>So I'm making a website where the will be multiple community's where people can join and play videos from YouTube. </p>  <p>A guy plays a video. Another guy joins the community 1 minute later. How can I make it so the video starts playing at the exact same time as the guy playing it?</p>  <p>Here's a basic idea I've got (best one so far) New guy joins Request sent to Web Socket server for current video time Web Socket server grabs the current time for the guy playing the video Web Socket server sends time to new guy JavaScript starts YouTube video at the time sent from Web Socket server</p>  <p>The thing is I'm not sure if its the best way to do it. Any suggestions / ideas?</p>
