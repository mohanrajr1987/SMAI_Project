<p>i just started with Javascript and Ajax and have the following problem:</p>  <p>The Video I have on my Server isn't recieved the way i thought it would be recieved. Here the body of the HTML where my Problem happens:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;body&gt;     &lt;video id= "vid" width="320" height="240" autoplay&gt;         &lt;!--&lt;source src="assets/vid/testVid.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;--&gt;         Your browser does not support the video tag.     &lt;/video&gt;      &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;          function checkNetConnection(){             jQuery.ajaxSetup({                 async:true,                 dataType: "video/mp4"             });             re="";             $.get("MyServerAdress/testVideos/test.mp4",function(data){                 re=true;                 var element = document.getElementById("vid");                 element.src = data;             }).error(function(){                 console.log("Failed Cors");             });             return re;         }     &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My Problem is that the Video doesn't show up. The Video is recieved successfully and in the preview of the debugger, the data shown is kryptic. If I put some other videos locally (see commented area) everything works fine. I already tried with the File Reader but I got errors that the data recieved isn't of the Type Blob.</p>  <p>Thank you very much for your help, SirSandmann</p>
