<p>The final device I'll be putting this on is an android TV box, but I'm testing on my galaxy s5. Both are having the same issue.</p>  <p>I'm using Full Screen Browser by Klurige, and I originally had some GIF's at the bottom of the page that I wanted to loop, but they ended up being to clunky and big to run efficiently on the TVbox, so I decided to switch over to html5. I've tried with WEBM and MP4, both are doing the same thing.</p>  <p>I have the autoplay and loop attributes in the html5 video as such: <code>&lt;video id="zach" loop autoplay class="picture"&gt;&lt;source src="P-Zach.webm"&gt;Error&lt;/video&gt;</code></p>  <p>Neither works be default in the browser. I just see a gray video icon. I can't even click to start it.</p>  <p>I've tried formatting in different ways and everything mentioned on the broken-links.com blog post people keep pointing to. I've tried javascript .play() options. None do anything. </p>  <p>If I add the controls attribute to the video, I can play the video, so I know the video file works, but it still won't loop.</p>  <p>Any help?</p>
