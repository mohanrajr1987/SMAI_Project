<p>My problem has two subproblems (is that a word?):</p>  <p>A. Parse date from string.</p>  <p>I have datetime from rss feed that has format like below:</p>  <pre><code>u'Wed, 30 Sep 2015 18:59:39 +0000' </code></pre>  <p>What is most 'pythonic' way to make a datetime from string above? I tried to do it with regex but I had about 20 lines of code to do that and I hope there is simplier way to do it, preferably without regex. I also don't know what is easy way to change <code>Sep</code> to <code>09</code>.</p>  <p>B. Insert to sqlite with Sqlalchemy</p>  <p>Here my problem is, I can't find example of code where I can see how to define column as datetime. Should it look like this?</p>  <pre><code>t = Table('t', medatata, Column('my_date', Datetime) </code></pre>  <p>And then just pass object of <code>datetime</code> to database?</p>
