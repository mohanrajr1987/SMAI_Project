<p>I'm making a guessing game where the program generates a random number from 0 to 10 and the user tries to guess it. I want the user to input an integer in a Text Area. Then I convert the input to integer. Here comes the problem: How do I do something if the input is an unconvertable string? Like "asdf". I want the program to output "I asked for a number!! not word dumbass!" but C# converts even things like "Aadsda" to 0.. what do i do?</p>  <p>This is what I tried:</p>  <pre><code>    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         try         {             int.TryParse(textBox_Guess.Text, out guess);             //IF STATEMENTS TO CHECK HOW CLOSE THE USER'S GUESS IS         }         catch (Exception)         {             //Since all strings are converted, this block is never executed              label_Reveal.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;             label_Reveal.Text = "Your input is invalid!";             label_Reveal.Show();          }     } </code></pre>
