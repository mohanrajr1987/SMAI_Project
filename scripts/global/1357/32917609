<p>I am very new to lua programming and am trying to parse a local file on my pc and then save certain elements of the table/array into strings.</p>  <p>I have been able to get all the data and print each line of the file, except I am having problems when trying to get specific value and save them into strings or just print a certain line.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Here is my code sample:</p>  <pre><code>function file_exists(file)   local f = io.open(file, "rb")   if f then f:close() end   return f ~= nil end   function lines_from(file)   if not file_exists(file) then return {} end   lines = {}   for line in io.lines(file) do     lines[#lines + 1] = line   end   return lines  end   local file = 'Stats.txt' local lines = lines_from(file)   for k,v in pairs(lines) do   print('line[' .. k .. ']', v) end </code></pre>
