<p><strong>Prelude</strong></p>  <p>I am trying to perform an operation which requires me to parse every individual word a particular file. The most straightforward way of doing this would be to load the text using the:</p>  <pre><code>$content = Get-Content -Path .\&lt;filename&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Then I will break every individual word into an individual line (this allows me to do a word count AND single word search very quickly). The problem is when I then use this line of code:</p>  <pre><code>$content.split("\s+") </code></pre>  <p>which should create a new line (split) on every (one or more) whitespace character. Unfortunately, my results look like this:</p>  <pre><code>$content.split("\s+") The SpeechSynthe izer cla  provide acce   to the functionality of a  peech  ynthe  i   engine that i   in talled on the ho t computer. In talled  peech  ynthe  i  engine </code></pre>  <p>But when I run </p>  <pre><code>$content -split("\s+") </code></pre>  <p>The results will come out correctly:</p>  <pre><code>$content -split("\s+") The SpeechSynthesizer class provides access to the functionality of a speech synthesis </code></pre>  <p><strong>My question</strong> Using powershell V.4 I am having trouble understanding what the difference between performing the operation.</p>  <p>$content.split("\s+")</p>  <p>and </p>  <pre><code>$content -split("\s+") </code></pre>  <p>is. And why they are outputting different results. </p>  <p>Is that functionality just broken?</p>  <p>Is there some other difference that I am not aware of at play here?</p>
