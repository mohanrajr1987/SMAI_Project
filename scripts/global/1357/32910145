<p>I am working on a small project that requires parsing sequential circuits (Flip flops, latches).  </p>  <p>I am allowed to use any open source parsers. Therefore, can you give me a list of the available online/open sources Verilog parsers? </p>  <p>I already found "Pyverilog" but I'd like to know if I can find more? </p>  <p>Also in "Pyverilog" is the order of evaluation provided ? because I'd like to parse sequential circuits and the order of evaluation is important to me?</p>
