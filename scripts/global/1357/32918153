<p>What I am looking to do is have a users input of multiple words which is currently in one variable split apart and each of the words stored in an array value. </p>  <p>For example a user types input of: "When in the course" and it's stored in a single variable "input"</p>  <p>How do I get each word of that variable into an array like such:</p>  <pre><code>array[0] = When array[1] = in array[2] = the array[3] = course etc. </code></pre>  <p>My end goal is to be able to run an if statement against the first word typed and use it to determine the course of action for what follows. </p>  <p>For example the user types: ADD when in the course</p>  <p>and I run an if statement against it:</p>  <pre><code>if array[0] = ADD then  file_ptr = fopen ("file1.txt", "a+");              fprintf(file_ptr, "%s" , buf," ");                     }             fclose(file_ptr); else if array[0] = delete </code></pre>  <p>then delete etc.</p>  <p>Thank you guys for the assistance.</p>
