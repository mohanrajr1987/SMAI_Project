<p>I'm using the <code>MongoDB</code> driver in Java.</p>  <p>Say I have a <code>MongoDB</code> document in the collection db.people:</p>  <p><code>{"name":"Joe", "surname":"Blow", "age":20}</code></p>  <p>and a Java class that looks something like </p>  <pre><code>`public class Person {    String name;    String surname;    int age;`    `public void setPersonalInfo(String name, String surname, int age) {      this.name = name;      this.surname = surname;      this.age = age;    } }` </code></pre>  <p>How do I parse the information from my document into my class? Is there a way to do this by manipulating the document in the form of a <code>BasicDBObject</code>? I looked through the methods and couldn't make sense of how, as my first inclination was to use a method which returns an array of key value pairs (as far as I know, no such method exists).</p>
