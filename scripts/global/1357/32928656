<p>I am working on a project for a class and we are tasked with writing a scanner for numbers, symbols, comments, arithmetic operators, parenthesis, and EOF in both Python and Racket. I am working on the racket version and I have written the following line to define one or more character as a symbol: </p>  <pre><code>[(any-char) (token-CHAR (string-&gt;character lexeme))] </code></pre>  <p>I have the following line to define on  or more digits as a number:</p>  <pre><code>[(:+ digit) (token-NUM (string-&gt;number lexeme))] </code></pre>  <p>I am very new to Racket, this is my third program, so I am not exactly sure how to approach this, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated. I have scoured the Racket documentation, but I wasn't able to find what I was looking for. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
