<p>i share websites content through Facebook Open Graph on Facebook. But some of the URL give the above error (though the url of posts and its images are correct). in example. this url works: <a href="http://dehmazang.org/post?id=00061&amp;cat=articles" rel="nofollow">http://dehmazang.org/post?id=00061&amp;cat=articles</a> or if i change its category(articles) to (roznigar) it also works: and if i just change its category(articles) to (goftago) it doesn't work and also changing to some other categories doesn't work. </p>  <p>I don't really know is there fault with website or Facebook.</p>
