<p>I'm trying to use <code>ANTLR V4</code> with the publicly given <code>Java 8</code> grammar - <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/java8/Java8.g4" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/java8/Java8.g4</a></p>  <p>I generated the class files and tried to parse the <code>Java 8 JRE</code>, but somehow at <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat.java</code> it crashes with:</p>  <pre><code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded </code></pre>  <p>It also <strong>crashes</strong>, when I'm trying to parse that single file alone.</p>  <p>Can this be solved somehow? Obviously <code>ANTLR V4</code> can't handle files with more than <strong>2000 LOC</strong>? Is that a correct assumption?</p>  <p>What I've done so far:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Changing assigned memory to <code>JVM</code> in multiple steps <strong>from 256MB up to 4GB</strong> - it then changes to </p>  <p>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</p></li> <li><p>To ensure that there is no syntactical problem with the input-file<br>   At first I <strong>removed the first half</strong> of the file -> <strong>parsing seems okay</strong>,<br>then undid that action and <strong>removed the second half of the file</strong> -> <strong>parsing seems okay</strong></p></li> </ul>
