<p>Just wondering what would be the best way of parsing a file containing lines of two "types":</p>  <ul> <li>int string</li> <li>string int</li> </ul>  <p>So in essence, if the first word is an integer, I'd like to do a certain action, and if it starts with a string, I'd want to do a different action.</p>  <pre><code>string word; int number;  ifstream inData; inData.open("file.txt"); </code></pre>  <p>So my dilemma is here. I want to make a while loop, but since I don't know what datatype the first word in a line is, I cannot write: <code>while( inData &gt;&gt; word/number)</code>.</p>
