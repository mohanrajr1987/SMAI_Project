<p>I made a calculator (based on a popular game and no I don't want to make any money out of it lol) in a WordPress plugin (ninja forms)  so in order for it to work it needs some Fields to be filled in and at the bottom it will calculate automatically some data. </p>  <p>It would be amazing if the user was capable of just entering his username and the values would be filled automatically parsing data from the game's public database (when you go to the game's site and enter your name you will get a Profile Page with all your values).</p>
