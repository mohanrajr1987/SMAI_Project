<p>I have <code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier</code> from the file <code>VM3154:1</code>. <br> The error appears after I login with a Parse user. I try to locate the file in my server and I cannot find this file. This file has only one line of code:</p>  <pre><code>[object Object] </code></pre>  <p>Anybody knows what is this file? What does it do?<br></p>  <p>There is an increment for the number every time I log in using Parse User function.</p>  <p>My web uses jQuery, AngularJS, Parse and Bootstrap.</p>
