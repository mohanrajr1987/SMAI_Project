<p>lets get right into this topic. So I have a output from an cydia app called "AutoTouch".</p>  <pre><code>touchDown(2, 634.4, 471.3); usleep(66685.62); touchUp(2, 635.4, 470.3); usleep(365600.04); </code></pre>  <p>Now, as i already made some functions for me, i want to parse that into something like that:</p>  <pre><code>tapp(634, 471); usleep(365600); </code></pre>  <p>What simple language would u reccomend i should use to do that? It should be easy, but also powerful (like compare numbers and such hardcore stuff ^^) and work on osx/linux.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help and i hope i used the word "parsing" correctly :)</p>
