<p>I need to pass something really simple. Imagine my string is </p>  <pre><code>     @"\"one two three\" four five". </code></pre>  <p>I want to get the strings <code>@"one two three"</code>, <code>@"four"</code> and <code>@"five"</code>. If the string is  <code>@"\"invalid string"</code>, I want to get <code>@"invalid"</code> and <code>@"string"</code>.</p>  <p>The library <code>PGEKit</code> seems to be great but complicated. Could anyone help me to achieve that?</p>
