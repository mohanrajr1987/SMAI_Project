<p>So I have an exercise that I should prove or disprove that:</p>  <p>1) if e is a minimum weight edge in the connected graph G such that not all edges are necessarily distinct, then every minimum spanning tree of G contains e</p>  <p>2) Same as 1) but now all edge weights are distinct.</p>  <hr>  <p>Ok so intuitively, I understand that for 1) since not all edge weights are distinct, then it's possible that a vertex has the path with edge e but also another edge e_1 such that if weight(e) = weight (e_1) then there is a spanning tree which does not contain the edge e since the graph is connected. Otherwise if both e_1 and e are in the minimum spanning tree, then there is a cycle </p>  <p>and for 2) since all edge weights are distinct, then of course the minimum spanning tree will contain the edge e since any algorithm will always choose the smaller path. </p>  <p>Any suggestions on how to prove these two though? induction? Not sure how to approach. </p>
