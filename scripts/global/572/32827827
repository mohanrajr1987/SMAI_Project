<p>I have the following tree in txt file (you can copy paste and save it into txt file):</p>  <pre><code>R&gt; res J48 pruned tree ------------------  Petal.Width &lt;= 0.6: setosa (50.0) Petal.Width &gt; 0.6 |   Petal.Width &lt;= 1.7 |   |   Petal.Length &lt;= 4.9: versicolor (48.0/1.0) |   |   Petal.Length &gt; 4.9 |   |   |   Petal.Width &lt;= 1.5: virginica (3.0) |   |   |   Petal.Width &gt; 1.5: versicolor (3.0/1.0) |   Petal.Width &gt; 1.7: virginica (46.0/1.0)  Number of Leaves  :     5  Size of the tree :  9 </code></pre>  <p>This is my input file. I would like to get the list of each node (father) and its kids of the tree (it is only an example). I would like to know if I can transfer this txt format into a tree by using <code>data.tree</code>. And how can I get the kids of each level (father)?</p>
