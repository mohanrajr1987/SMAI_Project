<p>Say we want to decrease the weight of one of the edges in the minimum spanning tree, E, produced from any given graph, G and show that it is still a minimum weight spanning tree when decreased. The objective is to prove that you can conduct a minimum weight spanning tree using w prime. When conducting the new minimum weight spanning tree with w prime, we choose an edge in the minimum weight spanning tree, E, and a positive number, n, using the following w prime rules:</p>  <p>(a,b) is an edge in the minimum weight spanning tree (E)</p>  <pre><code>  w'(r,s) =    { w(r,s) if (r,s) != (is not equal to) (a,b)                { w(a,b)-n if (r,s) = (a,b) </code></pre>  <p>I have done the following, but I don't believe it is correct. Can you clarify if I'm approaching this right:</p>  <p>Graph (G):</p>  <p>(A,D): 6</p>  <p>(A,B): 1</p>  <p>(B,E): 2</p>  <p>(E,F): 2</p>  <p>(C,F): 7</p>  <p>(B,C): 4</p>  <p>(D,C): 5</p>  <p>MST(E) (Minimum weight spanning tree (E)): </p>  <p>(A,D): 1</p>  <p>(B,E): 2</p>  <p>(E,F): 2</p>  <p>(B,C): 4</p>  <p>(C,D): 5</p>
