<p>On click of parent node in tree layout, link and linktext should exit. Link is exiting but not the linktext. Here is the jsfiddle <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/44nd20gk/" rel="nofollow">project</a>.                  I tried the code - <code>svg.selectAll(".line-label").remove();</code> which was deleting the linkText from all the labels that should not happen. What i am expecting is on click of node it exits the linkText like link and node from the current branch of the tree not from the whole tree itself.</p>
