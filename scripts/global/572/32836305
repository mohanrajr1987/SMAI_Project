<p>I am having trouble getting the following tree data type to print out in a way that shows the hierarchy of the tree:</p>  <pre><code>data Tree a b = Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b)               | Leaf a  instance (Show a, Show b) =&gt; Show (Tree a b) where          show t =  </code></pre>  <p>I can get the tree to print out its nodes in the correct order top to bottom, but I can't figure out how to make the show function keep track of how many spaces to add to a level to make it obvious that there is an actual <em>tree</em> structure being printed. I know I'm not giving much to go on with my instance definition, but I really just don't know where to begin since recursion is such a confusing thing to me right now.</p>
