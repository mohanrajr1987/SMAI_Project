<p>What does the treemp function does, here? What do the input and output correspond to?</p>  <pre class="lang-hs prettyprint-override"><code>import Data.Word import Data.Char import Data.List   import System.Environment  data Tree a = Leaf a | Root a [Tree a] deriving (Eq, Show)  treemp f (Leaf a) = Leaf $ f a treemp f (Root a ts) = Root (f a) $ map (treemp f) ts   t0 = Root 0 [t1,t2,t3,t4,t5]  t1 = Leaf 1  t2 = Root 2 [Leaf 6, Leaf 7, Root 11 [Leaf 12, Leaf 13]]  t3 = Root 3 [Leaf 8, Leaf 9]  t4 = Root 4 [Leaf 10]  t5 = Leaf 5 </code></pre>
