<p>How I can extract a subterm from a term in Prolog?</p>  <p>An example, I am trying to extract a predicate called r wherever it is but I do know how. Any help?</p>  <pre><code>term_extraxtions(s(n(1),t(3,4,r(2,4))),ModifiedTerm,ExtractedTerm) </code></pre>  <p>will be as follows.</p>  <pre><code>ModifiedTerm = s(n(1),t(3,4)). ExtractedTerm = r(2,4). </code></pre>  <p>Please note that I asked this question before in the following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32790999/how-i-can-extract-a-subterm-from-a-term-in-prolog/32802026#32802026">link</a>, but it was partially answered and I wish to know how I can allow to recurse on each argument, modify it extracting an element, and recompose the argument list as the user "CapelliC" suggested. I will copy his answer below:</p>  <pre><code>exterm(T, M, E) :-     T =.. [F|As],     select(E, As, Bs),     M =.. [F|Bs].   </code></pre>  <p>This predicate does most of the work:</p>  <pre><code>?- exterm(a(1,b(u)),M,E). M = a(b(u)), E = 1 ; M = a(1), E = b(u) ; M = a(1, b), E = u ; false. </code></pre>  <p>To generalize and complete your assignment, you must allow to recurse on each argument, modify it extracting an element, and recompose the argument list.</p>  <pre><code>... append(X, [Y|Ys], As), ... % recursive call append(X, [Z|Ys], Bs), ... </code></pre>  <p>See if you can complete it:</p>  <pre><code>?- exterm(s(n(1),t(3,4,r(2,4))),ModifiedTerm,ExtractedTerm), ExtractedTerm=r(_,_). ModifiedTerm = s(n(1), t(3, 4)), ExtractedTerm = r(2, 4) ; false. </code></pre>  <p>Here I've constrained the extracted term to match what you show in the question, otherwise there would be a long list of solutions to display...</p>  <p>Please any help on that will be great? </p>  <p>I did some tests on the following rule</p>  <pre><code>exterm(T, M, E) :-     T =.. [F|As],     select(E, As, Bs),     M =.. [F|Bs].   </code></pre>  <p>The first test is true</p>  <pre><code>?- exterm(a(1,r(1,2)),M,E),E=r(_,_). M = a(1), E = r(1, 2) ; </code></pre>  <p>The second test is false since the r predicate is embedded inside the b predicate</p>  <pre><code>?- exterm(a(1,b(u,r(1,2))),M,E),E=r(_,_). false. </code></pre>
