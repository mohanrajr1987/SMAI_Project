<p>I want to pass an custom object in-between activities. The object contains many links to other objects, which have many links to more objects and so on forming a tree like structure. I've been looking at making the classes parcelable. However each activity only needs access to each object and possibly it's children (but not it's grandchildren). The process of parcelling and unwrapping the whole tree structure seems a bit over the top. So I'm looking to be able to pass a node (and possibly it's children) in between activities without processing all of the node's descendants.</p>  <p>Other options I've seen are: EventBus - which I'm unfamiliar  Making the root static - which seems bad</p>  <p>Sorry if this question is unclear, I'll try to clarify if you have any questions</p>
