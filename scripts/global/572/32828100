<p>I enumerated lots of trees of a given size(e.g size = 10) from a big network(e.g 500nodes, 30000edges). Now, I wanna group isomorphic trees into a same class. I know that Nauty can do this by calculating a canonical label for each tree, but Nauty has n! time complexity. </p>  <p>Here, I wanna find a polynomial algorithm to calculate each tree's unique label(or canonical label). It would be better if there is implementation of the algorithm.</p>  <p>BTW, trees are not binary tree only.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>  <p>Tao</p>
