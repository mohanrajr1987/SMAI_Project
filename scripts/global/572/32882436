<p>I am trying to create a genealogical tree in igraph (R), and I used the following code:</p>  <pre><code>id = 1:5 parent = c(1,1,2,3,3) name = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E") data = data.frame(id, parent, name) n = graph.data.frame(data) co=layout.reingold.tilford(n, flip.y=T) plot &lt;- plot.igraph(g,layout=co, vertex.label = name) </code></pre>  <p>D and E should both have parent C, but this code often plots D and E on top of each other with only one arrow (instead of two). Does anybody have the solution for this problem?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cAI5m.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cAI5m.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
