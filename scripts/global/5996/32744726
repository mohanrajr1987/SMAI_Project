<p>I have hosted the <a href="http://jorani.org/" rel="nofollow">jorani Open Source LMS</a>, under local server and after logging in, redirects me to home page (<a href="http://localhost/lms/home" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/lms/home</a>), but I get a <strong>404 - File or directory not found.</strong> error.  What can I do to fix this? I know I need a server configuration but I don't know what. Thanks</p>
