<p>I have a school computer lab where we want to teach student how to deal with e-mail so I powered a <code>xampp</code> server on the main pc and modified it's settings. </p>  <p>I made 2 subdomain in the localhost and rename the localhost in host file to lab1.com . I installed wordpress in the domain named word.lab1.com and want to put a mail script on the domain mail.lab1.com </p>  <p>I tried everything on net all scripts of webmail. I dont want student to use thunderbird or outlook I want them to access my webpage on local server and register an e-mail account and deal with it from browser like we do on gmail or yahoo. </p>  <p>Can anybody solve this for me or tell me what script to use in php</p>
