<p>I'm trying to run the iPython Notebook HTTP server on a shared linux machine.  This works fine and I have it configured to listen only on loopback network interface (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888" rel="nofollow">http://127.0.0.1:8888</a>).</p>  <p>But I believe this means any other user on the shared machine can also access this listening server?  By doing so, they would then be able to run any commands as me.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a solution where I can run iPython Notebook on the shared machine, and access the Notebook session from the web browser on my personal laptop but no others can access the Notebook server.</p>  <p>I am aware of options to password protect the server, but so far that seems complicated in the follow-on vision where multiple users and multiple sessions exist on the same shared machine.</p>  <p>So the title question is really my focus. Is possible to restrict an open localhost port to just one user or terminal session or something along those lines?</p>
