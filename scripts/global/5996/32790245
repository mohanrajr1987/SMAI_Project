<p>There are lots of web frameworks that all seem to want to pull in a lot of files and have a "public" folder for as their document root for actual web-content. Is there any way to set Apache directives / configuration files so that I could type in my_appA/index.php, my_appB/index.php, etc. and get to my locally developed content and not have to worry about the messy folder structure you so often see in frameworks. Or is that not the right way to go about things? Please note: I don't have the computing power to handle this question via virtual machines. </p>
