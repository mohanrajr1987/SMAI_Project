<pre><code>import socket sock = socket.socket() sock.bind(('127.0.0.1', 1600)) sock.listen(1) (client_sock,client_address) = sock.accept() client_name = client_sock.recv(1024) client_sock.send('hi its '+client_name) client_sock.close() sock.close();   </code></pre>  <p>So i run on cmd command prompt the file containing the code above, and all i get is this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ti8PN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ti8PN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As it can be seen my cmd is as if waiting for something to happen, it doesnt print out "Hi its ..." and never ends from waiting. Why doesn't my code work ?</p>
