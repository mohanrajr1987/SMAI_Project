<p>I am trying to get Dreamweaver preview to work for php applications in Windows 10. it has been a pain so far.</p>  <p>I have the server info of:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/30cei.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/30cei.png" alt="Server Info"></a> <br /> <br /></p>  <p>and yet I get the this error in DW preview:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Bw7V.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Bw7V.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have xampp running and Apache and Mysql are both started and running with no problems, the file paths are correct, but I am not sure how to fix this myself. google searching didn't give me much either.</p>
