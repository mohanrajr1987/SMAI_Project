<p>I am attempting to access a web application I have developed inside my Parallels VM.  I think I have followed most things correctly however missing that last step I think.  I am running IIS7 and from OS X get the default blue IIS page when I hit <a href="http://10.211.55.3" rel="nofollow">http://10.211.55.3</a> and also <a href="http://10.211.55.3:80" rel="nofollow">http://10.211.55.3:80</a>.    I get the same message when I hit <a href="http://localhost:80" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:80</a> from within the VM. </p>  <p>When hitting those in Postman running on mac I get the message "405 - HTTP verb used to access this page is not allowed." but at least I get that blue page from IIS visible in the host so I figure that is something i.e. the network type setting as shared in the Configuration is correct.  </p>  <p>Also, Anonymous Authentication is Enabled in IIS for the site, and the firewall on the VM is off.</p>  <p>So I assume port 80 is getting through, however when I test another url/port no luck i.e. when I <a href="http://localhost:81/api/menuitem" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:81/api/menuitem</a> from within the VM, this time I get a 200 JSON response from my app as expected.  However when I hit the equivalent URL on the OS X host (<a href="http://10.211.55.3:81/api/menuitem" rel="nofollow">http://10.211.55.3:81/api/menuitem</a>) I get "Safari can't open the page because safari can't connect to the server 10.211.55.3".</p>  <p>I have also gone into Parallels Desktop-> Preferences->Advanced->ChangeSettings...-> and tried adding a Port Forwarding Rule for the IP address (setting both source &amp; destination ports to 81) but get the same result.  </p>  <p>So I think it is my VM setup or IIS. IS there a good resource for setting up IIS on a VM for external access in a development environment such as this maybe?</p>  <p>EDIT: With a little trial and error I now find I get the same "No response" result when hitting <a href="http://10.211.55.3:81/api/menuitem" rel="nofollow">http://10.211.55.3:81/api/menuitem</a> from within the VM, however the localhost equivalent (<a href="http://localhost:81/api/menuitem" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:81/api/menuitem</a>) works fine.  So the question comes down to how to setup IIS so the IP address works the same as localhost within the same development machine.</p>  <p>kind regards, Paul.</p>
