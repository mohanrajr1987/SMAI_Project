<p>I had an issue with HBase services not bind to localhost. On checking <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7939088/weird-dns-server-causes-hadoop-and-hbase-to-malfunction">this</a> post, I set 'lo' and issue resolved. (Earlier I tried with 'localhost' , '127.0.0.1' issue occurred still)</p>  <p>Now my question is, <strong>To set loop back interface, 'lo' is the correct value in  windows?</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback#Virtual_loopback_interface" rel="nofollow">This</a> post tells that "Unix-like systems usually name this loopback interface lo or lo0."</p>  <p>In windows 'lo' has same functionality like in Unix?</p>
