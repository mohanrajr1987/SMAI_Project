<p>I am trying to test offline feature of my HTML5 / Java application. I can imagine 2 ways to simulate that locally.</p>  <ol> <li><p>I turn of the wi-fi / internet of my laptop.  But localhost 0 127.0.0.1 doesn't have anything to do with internet and it still keeps serving my request.</p></li> <li><p>I stop the tomcat. In this case I get the standard browser error page (Unable to connect error message).</p></li> </ol>  <p>How could I test this on my local tomcat?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
