<p>I've been trying to access <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:3000/</a> but it kept saying: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</p>  <p>I'm trying to access it after running 'gulp serve' from a console. I've installed gulp, and have confirmed that it's running.</p>  <p>Here's what I tried so far:</p>  <ol> <li>Turned off Firewalls completely</li> <li>Tried accessing 127.0.0.1:3000</li> </ol>  <p>I've also checked the host file. It's properly configured. I don't know what's missing.</p>
