<p>I know this question has probably been asked 1 billion times. I've been banging my head against a wall trying to get this to work. I've edited both the sendmail.ini and php.ini files and made sure that IMAP is enabled on my gmail account.</p>  <p>Here are my files ---Sendmail.ini---</p>  <pre><code>; you must change mail.mydomain.com to your smtp server, ; or to IIS's "pickup" directory.  (generally C:\Inetpub\mailroot\Pickup) ; emails delivered via IIS's pickup directory cause sendmail to ; run quicker, but you won't get error messages back to the calling ; application.  smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com  ; smtp port (normally 25)  smtp_port=587  ; SMTPS (SSL) support ;   auto = use SSL for port 465, otherwise try to use TLS ;   ssl  = alway use SSL ;   tls  = always use TLS ;   none = never try to use SSL  smtp_ssl=auto  ; the default domain for this server will be read from the registry ; this will be appended to email addresses when one isn't provided ; if you want to override the value in the registry, uncomment and modify  ;default_domain=mydomain.com  ; log smtp errors to error.log (defaults to same directory as sendmail.exe) ; uncomment to enable logging  error_logfile=error.log  ; create debug log as debug.log (defaults to same directory as sendmail.exe) ; uncomment to enable debugging  ;debug_logfile=debug.log  ; if your smtp server requires authentication, modify the following two lines  auth_username= ******@gmail.com auth_password= *********  ; if your smtp server uses pop3 before smtp authentication, modify the  ; following three lines.  do not enable unless it is required.  pop3_server= pop3_username= pop3_password=  ; force the sender to always be the following email address ; this will only affect the "MAIL FROM" command, it won't modify  ; the "From: " header of the message content  force_sender=*******@gmail.com  ; force the sender to always be the following email address ; this will only affect the "RCTP TO" command, it won't modify  ; the "To: " header of the message content  force_recipient=  ; sendmail will use your hostname and your default_domain in the ehlo/helo ; smtp greeting.  you can manually set the ehlo/helo name if required  ;hostname=localhost </code></pre>  <p>And the mail function portion of my php.ini file</p>  <p>--php.ini---</p>  <pre><code>[mail function] ; XAMPP: Comment out this if you want to work with an SMTP Server like Mercury SMTP = smtp.gmail.com smtp_port = 587  ; For Win32 only. ; http://php.net/sendmail-from sendmail_from = *****@gmail.com  ; XAMPP IMPORTANT NOTE (1): If XAMPP is installed in a base directory with spaces (e.g. c:\program filesC:\xampp) fakemail and mailtodisk do not work correctly. ; XAMPP IMPORTANT NOTE (2): In this case please copy the sendmail or mailtodisk folder in your root folder (e.g. C:\sendmail) and use this for sendmail_path.   ; XAMPP: Comment out this if you want to work with fakemail for forwarding to your mailbox (sendmail.exe in the sendmail folder) sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"  ; XAMPP: Comment out this if you want to work with mailToDisk, It writes all mails in the C:\xampp\mailoutput folder ;sendmail_path="C:\xampp\mailtodisk\mailtodisk.exe"  ; Force the addition of the specified parameters to be passed as extra parameters ; to the sendmail binary. These parameters will always replace the value of ; the 5th parameter to mail(), even in safe mode. ;mail.force_extra_parameters =  ; Add X-PHP-Originating-Script: that will include uid of the script followed by the filename mail.add_x_header=Off  ; Log all mail() calls including the full path of the script, line #, to address and headers ;mail.log = "C:\xampp\php\logs\php_mail.log" </code></pre>  <p>Is configuring localhost mail usually this sucky?</p>
