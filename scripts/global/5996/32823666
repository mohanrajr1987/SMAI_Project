<p>Mysql on localhost(ubuntu) was working properly. I just restarted it and since then it is not starting properly. I stopped, reinstalled mysql-server and php5-mysql, killed existing mysql processes, stopped mysql and started again, still no luck. When i do mysql status, below is what response looks like. </p>  <p>● </p>  <pre><code>mysql.service - MySQL Community Server    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)    Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Mon 2015-09-28 18:19:56 IST; 4min 43s ago   Process: 23715 ExecStartPost=/usr/share/mysql/mysql-systemd-start post (code=killed, signal=TERM)   Process: 23714 ExecStart=/usr/bin/mysqld_safe (code=exited, status=2)   Process: 23712 ExecStartPre=/usr/share/mysql/mysql-systemd-start pre (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)  Main PID: 23714 (code=exited, status=2)  Sep 28 18:15:34 osp52 mysqld_safe[23714]: 150928 18:15:34 mysqld_safe Logging to '/var/log/mysql/error.log'.
