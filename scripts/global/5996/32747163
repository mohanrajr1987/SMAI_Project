<p>My company has a test website that I can access from their remote server however I also have to the code to the website in an EAR that I attach to my websphere server to run a localhost version. Theres a website to direct my traffic and it says my local overrides are in place and  I have my code pointed to the right runway. I made a small change in a jsp file to see if when I run the code on my localhost I will actually see that change on the website. However I don't see the change. Is there a way to see whether that jsp is being pulled from my localhost or remote server?</p>
