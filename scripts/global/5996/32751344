<p>I am trying to use some ajax to send some email.  I have done this before using cold fusion and had no issue.  </p>  <p>What I am running into is that <strong>localhost</strong> is not finding a file that is clearly in the directory.  In fact the file sits in the same directory as index.php which is finds no problem.  However it gives me a <strong>404 error file not found</strong> on my send.php file.  I have even tried to go directly to the page via the address bar and it does not find the file.  <em>If I put in the file path ie - file:///C://xampp/htdocs/3H-Web-Wlements/send.php it will display the code.</em></p>  <p>However when I upload to my active server it has no issues.</p>  <p>What am I missing here?</p>  <p>Here is the error from the log: [Wed Sep 23 19:33:34.295785 2015] [:error] [pid 2552:tid 1752] [client ::1:63670] script 'C:/xampp/htdocs/index.php' not found or unable to stat, referer: <a href="http://localhost/3H-Web-Wlements/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/3H-Web-Wlements/</a></p>  <p>Do I have something mis-configured or even not configured?<br> Like I said.  It works on my active server but fails on localhost only.</p>  <p>my send.php code</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php /*  **************************************  *                                    *  * Config here                        *  *                                    *  **************************************  */  $to = 'xxx@gmail.com'; $subject = 'Message from website'; $siteName = "xxx";  /*  *************************************************************  *                                                           *  *      Don't Change below code, if you don't know php.      *  *                                                           *  *************************************************************  */  $name = $_POST['contactName']; $mail = $_POST['contactEmail']; $subject = $_POST['contactWebsite']; $note = $_POST['contactMessage']; $ipAdd = $_POST['contactIp'];  if (isset($name) &amp;&amp; isset($mail) &amp;&amp; isset($note)) {       // $mailSub = '[Contact] [' . $siteName .
