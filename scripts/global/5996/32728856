<p>I'm making a launcher for my server. (rust game) To join the server, the players must type:</p>  <pre><code>net.connect ip:port (Ex: net.connect 192.132.111.1:28015) </code></pre>  <p>I want to know how to make them join by localhost IP</p>  <pre><code>net.connect 127.0.0.1:28015  </code></pre>  <p>A server from the same game, has already done that. The main reason of this is to hide the original IP of the server, so that players can't join with a normal client, and just join with our launcher.</p>
