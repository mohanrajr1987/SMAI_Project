<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $db = new mysqli("localhost","username","password","SomeDatabase");  $q="SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE id=".$_POST["id"]; echo($db-&gt;query($q)-&gt;fetch_assoc()["foo"]); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I run it on localhost, it does exactly what I want. When uploaded online, however, it gives the parsing error:  "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '[' in ... on line 4"</p>  <p>I imagine that </p>  <pre><code>$db-&gt;query($q)-&gt;fetch_assoc()["foo"] </code></pre>  <p>is illegal, but then why would localhost accept it as a valid statement?</p>  <p>Can you tell me whether this statement is (should be) valid? And why is there a discrepancy between the servers? Thanks.</p>
