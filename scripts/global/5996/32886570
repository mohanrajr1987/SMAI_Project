<p>I have a little SQL problem.</p>  <p>I want to select 5 random rows of the 20 rows with highest <code>ID</code>. How do I do that? At the moment my <code>SqlDataSource</code> just looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;asp:SqlDataSource ID="SqlDataSource25" runat="server"       ConnectionString="&lt;%$ ConnectionStrings:DatabaseConnectionString1 %&gt;"      ProviderName="&lt;%$ ConnectionStrings:DatabaseConnectionString1.ProviderName %&gt;"      SelectCommand="SELECT TOP 5 * FROM [billeder] ORDER BY newid()"&gt;   &lt;/asp:SqlDataSource&gt; </code></pre>  <p>which means I of course just gets 5 random from the entire table.</p>  <p>I would prefer to do it via the <code>SqlDataSource</code> as you can see here, but if it is only possible via codebehind that is fine aswell. Any tips would be appreciated.</p>
