<p>I've installed EasyPHP and Virtual Host Manager - got it up and running, created a virtual host, pointed it to the directory to where i have my website stored. It's on the D Drive however when i click on the virtual host that i've created it points to a directory inside where the installation took place for EasyPHP as shown below;</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7lLaJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7lLaJ.png" alt="EasyPHP Admin"></a></p>  <p>Browsing the localhost development URL shows this; <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/la4TS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/la4TS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So the only way i got it working was to dump the site folder inside the projects folder and it worked. Strange. Anyone know how i can get it to load from the virtual host URL and directory?</p>
