<p>I have to test a broadcast with acknowledgement on localhost. So I have some text files that represent the nodes and inside there is a list of neighbors.<br> I use localhost as the IP and the port is the number of the node.</p>  <p>The problem is when I receive a message (that I sent) from a node like 7000, python replaces it with a random number for example 65724. So now my father is 65724 instead of 7000, so I cannot remove 7000 from the list of neighbors.<br> I cannot complete my algorithm and that is very frustrating. </p>  <p>I can send a message with the port number that I want, but it's not very elegant.</p>  <p>Could someone tell me how to not allow python to randomize the port?</p>  <p>rmunn saved me, the answer I was looking far is the bind before connect method. Befor sending a message you bind your own port and you connect to the other one.</p>
