<p>I am trying to import a project into Eclipse. I have tried File->Import, and all of the options for importing folders, existing projects, and archives, but when I import them and click Properties, there is no Java Build Path option. </p>  <p>I suspect that my Aptana Studio plugin for Eclipse is causing problems, especially since the Existing Folder As New Project option by default shows the Project Type as Web - Primary (which I obviously deselected).</p>  <p>I don't think Eclipse recognizes that the project is a Java project and it thinks that it might be some other type of project, like a web project. How should I properly import the project into Eclipse?</p>  <p>Sorry if this is a simple question; I cannot figure it out.</p>
