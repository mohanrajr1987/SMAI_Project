<p>I'm currently using Eclipse Mars on OS X to build a PHP based application which requires a web server for a form submission. However, upon attempting to add Tomcat 7.0 as a server, the server list is empty (shown below).<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hiRFk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hiRFk.png" alt="Blank Server List"></a></p>  <p>I've been following several tutorials for setting up and configuring a Tomcat server and each one says to place the extracted Tomcat folder in the Eclipse workspace directory so they'll be detected when adding them in Eclipse. The Apache Tomcat folder is in the workspace directory but it still isn't being detected. I've tried reinstalling Eclipse and deleting any duplicate files but I keep getting the same result. How can I properly set up and configure an Apache Tomcat server in Eclipse Mars?</p>
