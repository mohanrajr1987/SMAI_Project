<p>I need to make my Tycho-Maven build work in offline mode, so I can deploy it to environments with no Internet connection and let people run the build from the previously downloaded artifacts for the third party code my app depends on. The product being built is an Eclipse RCP product, using the <code>org.eclipse.tycho:target-platform-configuration</code> plug-in to load the dependencies from an RCP target file.</p>  <p>First I run <code>mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/some/path/ -DgeneratePom=true clean install</code> to create the artifacts, and that build succeeds. Then when I run <code>mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/some/path/ -o clean install</code> it fails because it's running in offline mode and there is no local cache available for <code>http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/8.6</code></p>  <p>So then I run <code>mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/some/path/ dependency:go-offline</code> to make it download all the artifacts it needs for the build, but it fails with this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal   org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.8:resolve-plugins   (resolve-plugins) on project : Nested: Could not transfer   artifact com.google.guava:guava:jar:[10.0.1,14.0.1] from/to central   (<a href="https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2" rel="nofollow">https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</a>): Illegal character in path at   index 60:   <a href="https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/[10.0.1,14.0.1]/guava-[10.0.1,14.0.1].jar" rel="nofollow">https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/[10.0.1,14.0.1]/guava-[10.0.1,14.0.1].jar</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Index 60 is the "[" character in the version range specifier for the guava jar. I have no idea where that URL gets created and why it's not URL-encoded. It would be nice to get the dependency:go-offline goal to complete execution, but I don't think it's the source of my problem.</p>  <p>The reason I say that is when I run that goal, I see this in the output</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[INFO] Adding repository   <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/8.6" rel="nofollow">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/8.6</a> [INFO] Fetching   p2.index from <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/8.6/r/" rel="nofollow">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/8.6/r/</a>   (0B at 0B/s)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I don't know why it downloads 0 Bytes, but I assume this is why I can't find a cache of the CDT bundles when I try to do an offline build.</p>  <p>If anyone has an idea how to work around this failure, or any other approach to make an offline build work, that would be very helpful.</p>
