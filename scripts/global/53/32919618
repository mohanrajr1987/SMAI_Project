<p>I have newest Eclipse version installed on my laptop. When I try to use shortcut "syso" for <code>System.out.println()</code> (I click CTRL + SPACE) i get two new windows like this: </p>  <p><a href="http://www.deviantpics.com/images/2015/10/03/Untitled.jpg" rel="nofollow">Eclipse - two windows syso</a></p>  <p>But on my older laptop, when I click same combinations of keyboard buttons, I instantly get <code>System.out.println()</code> without any questions like on the added picture. </p>  <p>I tried compare Eclipse settings between two computers, but there are huge number of preferences to configure under Eclipse. I open <em>Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Templates</em> and found sysout, then clicked edit, but settings are same.  Can someone help me, please? Many thanks, Java begginer</p>  <p>EDIT: I found on older laptop (and Eclipse version) there is no syso template, only sysout, but both working On new laptop same template, only working sysout</p>
