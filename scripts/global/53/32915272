<p>I am trying to work with Eclipse on my laptop - 3200x1800 resolution.</p>  <p>A majority of the icons are practically invisible.</p>  <p>I found two discussions on this very topic:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20718093/eclipse-interface-icons-very-small-on-high-resolution-screen-in-windows-8-1">Eclipse interface icons very small on high resolution screen in Windows 8.1</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32309024/eclipse-icons-are-really-small-on-high-resolution-screen">Eclipse Icons are really small on high resolution screen</a></p>  <p>Where it can be seen that this is an open issue in the eclipse bug system, yet to be fixed:</p>  <p><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382972" rel="nofollow">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382972</a></p>  <p>I tried the workarounds suggested in both discussions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Using Windows XP compatibility mode didn't work for me since it was removed in Windows 8.1 eclipse version). </p></li> <li><p>Setting a lower resolution results in an ugly result since my laptop is configured to work with high resolution for most applications.</p></li> <li><p>The solution suggested here -</p></li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20718093/eclipse-interface-icons-very-small-on-high-resolution-screen-in-windows-8-1/23024828#23024828">Eclipse interface icons very small on high resolution screen in Windows 8.1</a></p>  <p>seemed the most promising one. However, even when I observed there are new forks for this GitHub project, and tried the newest one - </p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/PhantomYdn/eclipse-icon-enlarger" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PhantomYdn/eclipse-icon-enlarger</a></p>  <p>it failed for me: I managed to create the jar file as instructed and run it on my Eclipse, however the resulting eclipse.exe fails to run with a message: "The eclipse executable launcher was unable to locate its companion shared library".</p>  <p>By googling this one I found -</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7070968/eclipse-executable-launcher-error-unable-to-locate-companion-shared-library">Eclipse executable launcher error: Unable to locate companion shared library</a></p>  <p>which led me to a conclusion that the enlarger just didn't work correctly. Since I don't know Java yet, I'm a bit stuck now.</p>  <p>How do I proceed from here?</p>  <p>Alternatively, is there another solution for my problem?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
