<p>I have a Maven WAR project, managed under Eclipse using <code>m2e</code> and <code>m2e-wtp</code>. In my <code>pom.xml</code>, I configure the <code>maven-war-plugin</code> to filter some resources in <code>src/main/resources</code>, and to put them in the classpath.</p>  <p>My files are correctly filtered, both in <code>project/target/finalname/WEB-INF/classes/</code> and in <code>project/target/m2e-wtp/web-resources/WEB-INF/classes/</code>. However, when I run my webapp using <code>J2EE Preview</code>, the values are read unfiltered. </p>  <p>After investigating, I discovered that the files read, in my webapp launched on the <code>J2EE Preview</code> server, were located in <code>WORKSPACE/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/tmp0/project/WEB-INF/classes/</code>, and that they were unfiltered. </p>  <p>So it seems that <code>m2e-wtp</code> is correctly doing his job here, but that the server adapter somehow messes up the filtering. It seems to acquire the unfiltered resources directly from <code>src/main/resources/</code>, to put them in the <code>.metadata/</code> dir, instead of acquiring them from <code>project/target/</code>. </p>  <p>How could I make sure that the server adapter acquires the filtered resources?</p>
