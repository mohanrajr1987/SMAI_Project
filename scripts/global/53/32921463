<p>At first I got an error while exporting my android app in eclipse:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>AndroidManifest.xml does not declare a Java package: Build aborted.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I posted this problem in various forums and one guy told me to do these steps:</p>  <ol> <li><p>you need to enter a valid Bundle ID for Google Play. Something similar to "com.company.gamename".  </p></li> <li><p>Don't use any special characters.</p></li> </ol>  <p>BUT whenever I try to click on rename application package, the menu disappears and nothing shows up.</p>  <p>Please Help... </p>
