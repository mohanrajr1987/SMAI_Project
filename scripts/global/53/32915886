<p>So I have nearly 300 plug-ins and features in my workspace at any given time. And I want to quickly filter the Package Explorer view, to show only projects that have, say, <em>xyz</em> in their name. Is there a way to do this?</p>  <p>I can't seem to find a way to search for projects specifically in the search dialogs either. I feel this should be straightforward but can't seem to recall how to do it right now, if it was ever possible.</p>  <p>Using eclipse 4.4.2, on windows 7.</p>
