<p>I recently upgraded Xcode 7 to Xcode 7.0.1, and now my code seems to be broken.</p>  <pre><code>var geog = [(cap:String(),paese:String(),moneta:String())]  geog.append(cap:"Roma",paese:"Italia",moneta:"Euro") // error here </code></pre>  <p>The error is: <code>cannot invoke 'append' with an argument list of .......</code></p>  <p>The same code worked with Swift 1, and even worked with Swift 2, however it seems to be completely broken now.</p>  <p>I have hundreds of lines of code with this error and i don't want to rewrite them all if it worked before. How can I solve this?</p>
