<p>I have been trying to figure out how to find the mode of a list <strong>WITHOUT</strong> using sorting functions nor importing any modules for quite awhile now... Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>d = {} def mode():     for i in mode:         if i in d:             d[i] += 1         else:             d[i] = 1     return </code></pre>  <p>How do I find the output such as the following:</p>  <pre><code>print(mode([1, 5, 6, 1, 1, 2])) [1] print(mode([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] </code></pre>  <p>Thanks a bunch!</p>
