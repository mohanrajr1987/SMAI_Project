<p>I am writing a code in which I need to create a <code>std::string</code> by appending data to it(here data means logs of an application). But string also has its limitation of size. I have written the code in <code>try-catch</code> block and when <code>append()</code> fails, it throws exception. I need to check before <code>append()</code> whether attaching new string will cause any <code>exception</code>, since once exception is thrown, it clears the data from string.<br> I want to check if attaching new string will cause any exception and if yes then write the data to a file and clear the string for next input.<br> As it is an application log, I do not know what the final size will be. So I am trying to make code less vulnerable to above explained problem.<br> I have checked one condition as follows:<br> If "<code>current_string_size + to_be_attached_string_size exceeds string.max_size()</code>" then write the code into file.<br> If "not" then append to_be_attached_string to current_string.<br> But it is failing somewhere.<br> What condition I need to check?</p>
