<p>I have two lists of tuples:</p>  <pre><code>myList1=[(1,2,3,4),(5,6,7),(8,9,10,11,12)] myList2=[(1,2,7,6,2,1,3),(5,3,2,1,8,9,6),(11,12,1,2,5,6,6)] </code></pre>  <p>I want to find the frequency of the elements in <code>myList2</code>, which are common to <code>myList1</code> and add them.</p>  <p>Something like this:</p>  <p>5 </p>  <p>3</p>  <p>2</p>  <p>2</p>  <p>2</p>  <p>3</p>  <p>0</p>  <p>2</p>  <p>2</p>  <p>Explanation: 5 # In <code>myList2</code>, elements of <code>myList1</code> occurred 5 times. i.e 1 (2 times), 2 (2 times) and 3 (1 time) , hence 5.  Same applies for other results.  I tried looping over two lists and using <code>count</code>, but it didn't work. </p>
