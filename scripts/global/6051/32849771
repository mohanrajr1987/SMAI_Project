<p>I will first say the if I want to receive a form in my PHP file and read the select's multiple values that were sent, it works like this:</p>  <pre><code>foreach ($_POST["selectaddedsubj"] as $selectedOption)     echo $selectedOption."\n"; </code></pre>  <p>and that in order for that to work, the name and id of the select should be like that:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;select name="selectaddedsubj[]" id="selectaddedsubj[]" size="3" multiple="multiple"&gt;      &lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>  <p>BUT, when I append values to it using jQuery, it will only work if I remove the [] from the name:</p>  <pre><code>$("#selectaddedsubj").append($('&lt;option&gt;', {     value: subjname,     text: subjname,     selected: 'selected' })); </code></pre>  <p>instead of <code>$("#selectaddedsubj[]").append</code> which wont work... :(   </p>  <p>Can I receive multiple selection on my PHP page from a form's SELECT variable in a different way rather than naming it using "[]" on my form?</p>
