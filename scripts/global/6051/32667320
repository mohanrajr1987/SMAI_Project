<p>I have a list of tuples, each containing two elements. The first element of few sublists is common. I want to compare the first element of these sublists and append the second element in one lists. Here is my list:</p>  <pre><code>myList=[(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(3,9),(3,10)] </code></pre>  <p>I would like to make a list of lists out of it which looks something like this:`</p>  <pre><code>NewList=[(2,3,4,5),(6,7,8),(9,10)] </code></pre>  <p>I hope if there is any efficient way. </p>
