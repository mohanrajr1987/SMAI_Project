<p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt students = [6,3,1,8,2]  a=[] for s in students:     a.append((s/20)*100)  values =[] for b in a:     values.append(b) print(values)  values = [30, 15, 5 , 40, 10]  # Need to be the array of % values. Want to grab values from the print values colors = ['yellowgreen', 'gold', 'lightskyblue', 'lightcoral', 'red']  plt.pie(values, labels=[6,3,1,8,2], colors=colors,         autopct='%1.1f%%', shadow=True, startangle=90) </code></pre>  <p>What I am trying to do is that read in values from the array named "students", and use those numbers to get a percent value of each of those number. The total number of students are 20, if we add all the numbers in the array. So, for ex: if we want to know what % of students is 1, then as I have it setup in the first for loop, it takes the number, it our case 1, we divide that by 20 and multiply by 100 to get the %. The output is:</p>  <pre><code>30.0 15.0 5.0 40.0 10.0 </code></pre>  <p>Furthermore, now I want to store those values in a separate array, so that I can use all those % values when I plot my pie chart. However, I keep getting an error, and I don't know how to solve it. The error is:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: 'float' object is not iterable </code></pre>  <p>Please help me so that I can get a graph same or similar to the one in the image below. I created it using excel.</p>  <p><a href="http://oi57.tinypic.com/14ch2m0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://oi57.tinypic.com/14ch2m0.jpg</a></p>  <p>Thanks for the help</p>
