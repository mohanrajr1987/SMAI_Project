<p>I am trying to append a value to an existing registry value which is a REG_MULTI_SZ entry.  Here is the small batch file...</p>  <pre><code>set regpath=HKCU\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0x64\Scheme: Default\Window Positions\Docking Toolbars set regvalue=Rui files set regdata=C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5.0\Plug-ins\Deadline7\deadline.rui reg query "%regpath%" /v "%regvalue%"  reg add "%regpath%" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /v "%regvalue%" /d "%regdata%" </code></pre>  <p>The entry I am trying to append to is the string "Rui files"  For arguments sake let's say the values that are tied to "Rui files" are the paths: C:\test1 and C:\test2.  I need to add on the 3rd line the entry that is shown above next to regdata which starts with C:\Program Files, etc.  The reg add command at the bottom is what I am trying to run.  I need to append the C:\Program Files path to the "Rui files" entry which is the C:\test1 and C:\test2 paths.  Is it possible to do without overwriting the existing entries and just adding to them?  Thank you.</p>
