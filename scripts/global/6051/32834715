<pre><code>a = [ 1, 2, [3,4] ] b = list(a) # create a shallow copy of a c = a print (b is a) # False print (c is a)  b.append(100) # append element to b print (b) print (a) # a is unchanged print (c)  c.append(100) # append element to c print (b) # b is unchanged print (a)  print (c)  b[2][0] = -100 # modify an element inside b print (b) print (a)  # a is changed  print (c)  c[2][0] = -200 print (b) # b is changed  print (a) # a is changed  print (c) </code></pre>  <p>As a beginner in python, I'm not sure what is the meaning of shadow copy, why b.append cannot change a, why c.append cannot change b, why b[2][0] can change a, and why c[2][0] can change b. Thank you!</p>
