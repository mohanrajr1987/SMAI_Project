<p>I'm looking at using <a href="https://www.pipelinedb.com/" rel="nofollow">PipelineDB</a> for analytics. For data warehousing I want to append all new data to a file, and <code>tail -F</code> it into <code>psql</code> like the examples on the website.</p>  <p>I have multiple data sources, so to get deterministic results, I'd like to append them all to the same input file, where they'll stay in the same order.</p>  <p>Is there a simple, idiomatic way of avoiding race conditions? Something like a single-file server I can pipe data to?</p>  <p>Edit:</p>  <p>Actually, a race condition is exactly what I <strong>want</strong>. But each line must be atomic, so no single line is ever corrupted. Lines may be interleaved, though.</p>
