<p>I have an external template file with a  structure that is dynamically added to a table when a button is clicked. When the new table line is added this way, I need to call a callback on this newly added piece of code. </p>  <p>I would like to know, what is the best way to select this new  code. It has an ID, so it won't be a problem to write some other selector, but I was wondering if there is an easier and fast way how to select it.</p>  <p>Here is the piece of code:</p>  <pre><code>$rightSpot.append(app.renderTemplate('temp/product', tplData )); </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This works for me, but maybe there is a better way:</p>  <pre><code>$newProduct = $rightSpot.find('tr').last().find('textarea'); </code></pre>
