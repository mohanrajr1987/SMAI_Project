<p>I've searched and searched and can't seem to find an answer to this so please forgive me if I'm asking a question that's already been answered.</p>  <p>I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Tampermonkey for Chrome</a>. It's the Chrome version of Greasemonkey. I'm a frequent user of a forum at <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com" rel="nofollow">http://forum.xda-developers.com</a>. Whenever I go to post a reply on that forum I like to change the font. The reply editor is somewhat like the editor here on Stackoverflow-- a code editor. So when you change the font what it does is wrap font tags around your text in your editor's text field like this example below:</p>  <pre><code>[FONT="Arial"]This is a reply.[/FONT] </code></pre>  <p>Now what I'd like to do is use Javascript or jQuery to automatically prepend [FONT="Arial"] and append [/FONT] to the editor's text input field upon page load.</p>  <p>So, that being said, what Javascript or jQuery would I use to automatically prepend and append that text upon page load?</p>
