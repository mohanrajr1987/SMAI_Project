<p>I have a multiline string in which I want to append some multiline text and keep the indentation for the appended lines of text. An example probably explains the issue better: </p>  <pre><code>StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); int int1 = 50000; double double1 = 5800.0; string test = "Test\r\nSome\r\nMultiline\r\nstuff."; sb.AppendFormat("{0,8};{1,8};{2}",int1,double1,test); Console.Write(sb.ToString()); </code></pre>  <p>This will give me the output</p>  <pre><code>50000;    5800;Test Some Multiline stuff. </code></pre>  <p>However what I wish to attain is </p>  <pre><code>50000;    5800;Test                Some                Multiline                stuff. </code></pre>  <p>I'm aware there are ways to handle this by writing your own functionality, however I was hoping the StringBuilder class or a similar construct could help me.</p>
