<p>I am looking for a solution to add rows to a dataframe. Here is the data I have :  A grouped object ( obtained by grouping a dataframe on month and year i.e in this grouped object key is [month,year] and value is all the rows / dates in that month and year). </p>  <p>I want to extract all the month , year combinations and put that in a new dataframe. <strong>Issue</strong> : When I iterate over the grouped object, month, row is a tuple, so I converted the tuple into a list and added it to a dataframe using thye append command. Instead of getting added as rows :  1 2014 2 2014 3 2014 it got added in one column  0 1 1 2014 0 2 1 2014 0 3 1 2014 ...</p>  <p>I want to store these values in a new dataframe. Here is how I want the new dataframe to be :      month  year      1     2014      2     2014      3     2014</p>  <p>I tried converting the tuple to list and then I tried various other things like pivoting. Inputs would be really helpful. </p>  <p>Here is the sample code :</p>  <pre><code>    df=df.groupby(['month','year'])     df = pd.DataFrame()     for key, value in df:             print "type of key is:",type(key)             print "type of list(key) is:",type(list(key))             df = df.append(list(key))     print df </code></pre>
