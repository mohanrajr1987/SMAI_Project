<p>I'm using the method shown <a href="http://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/blocking_basic_get.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> like this:<br> <code>while method_frame is None:     method_frame, header_frame, method_frame= channel.basic.get("test_queue)</code></p>  <p>It's looks like this polling is not so efficient this way, because basic get is working also if queue is empty, and bringing empty messages.  </p>  <p>I need a kind of logic which takes a single message, only when I have the opportunity to take care of it, that's why I chose <code>basic.get</code> and not <code>basic.consume</code>.    </p>  <p>Do anybody has and idea for doing a more efficient polling maybe by using some pika's library other mechanism?</p>
