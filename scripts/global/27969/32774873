<p>Followed the instructions for creating an SSL set of files with a self signed certificate according to rabbit <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html" rel="nofollow" title="SSL Support">docs</a>.</p>  <p>I am using it for the management plugin instead only for now, by configuring rabbitmq.config like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>{rabbitmq_management,       [ {http_log_dir,  "/tmp/rabbit-mgmt"},</p>  <pre><code>                            {rates_mode,    basic},                              {listener, [{port,     7357},                                          {ssl,      true},                                          {ssl_opts, [{cacertfile, "/path/to/ca_certificate.pem"},                                                     {certfile,   "/path/to/server_certificate.pem"},                                                     {keyfile,    "/path/to/server_key.pem"},                                                     {verify,verify_peer},                                                     {fail_if_no_peer_cert,false}                                                    ]}                                        ]}                           ]} </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>The server starts, and the https port seems open, however, the connection fails as soon as a request is received with:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>=ERROR REPORT==== 25-Sep-2015::14:25:33 ===       application: mochiweb       "Accept failed error"       "{error,{options,{cacertfile,\"/path/to/ca_certificate.pem\",\n                            {error,eacces}}}}"</p>      <p>=ERROR REPORT==== 25-Sep-2015::14:25:33 === {mochiweb_socket_server,295,{acceptor_error,{error,accept_failed}}}</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried <code>chown</code> and <code>chgrp</code> of the folders that have all the certificate files created by following the documentation, but still have the same access error.</p>
