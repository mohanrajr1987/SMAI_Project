<p>I've been running into an issue lately. I'm trying to send packets to a remote server using RabbitMQ and Java for quite some time and I really need some help. Here is what my code looks like </p>  <pre><code>ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory(); //factory.setHost("localhost"); factory.setUsername("dev"); factory.setPassword("/*user password*/"); factory.setVirtualHost("/"); //not really sure what this means factory.setHost("/*remote server IP*/"); //is this correct factory.setPort(5672); connection = factory.newConnection(); </code></pre>  <p>I am using Windows Server 2012, I've added rules to the firewall to allow both UDP &amp; TCP on ports 5672 and 15672 for inbound connections. Would these also be the ports for outgoing? I assume I'd have to allow on these ports on my desktop as well. I know my packets send and work locally, tested that plenty of times. I just can't get that remote connection to work without timing out. I'd love help!</p>
