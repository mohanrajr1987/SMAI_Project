<p>I'd like to know what the advantages are of using kombu to manage messaging and queuing for a RabbitMQ server and some python apps. Is it just that one can swap out the amqp implementation later or is there more to it than that? Does kombu replace the need for pika with something that is not tied to RabbitMQ specifically? I know that sometimes we'll use Celery, and sometimes we'll want to use RabbitMQ directly without Celery and am not clear on how best to go about this in 2015.  </p>
