<p>I have to say the official website provide very little information to understand rabbitmq clearly.</p>  <p>The official website suggest using three nodes to build cluster. What is the reason to do that? I suppose it does not like the zookeeper, which need odd nodes to do a quorum and elect the master.</p>  <p>Also, what is the advantage to use non-HA cluster, improve the performance or what? If the node which queue resided down, then the queue is not working. So for all situation, it is necessary to set the cluster to be mirror queue and auto-sync? </p>
