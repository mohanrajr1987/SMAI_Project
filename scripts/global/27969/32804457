<p>I'm using RabbitMQ in my application for communication between the Clint's and the server. </p>  <p>Most of the time clients sends information to the server but sometimes the clients need to know about some updates in the server. </p>  <p>Currently I'm using polling in 1 min interval to ask the server if there are some updates. </p>  <p>My question is will it be better to use Publish/Subscribe mechanism to "push" updates to the clients?</p>  <p>I have large numbers of clients 10000 so will it be ok to open 10000 queues, one for each client?</p>
