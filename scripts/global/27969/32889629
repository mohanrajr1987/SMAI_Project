<p>I want to create small app which will receive data from RabbitMQ server using python pika and than process this data (cut unnecessary data), create simpler notification and send it to socket.io server. Problem is that I have no idea how to edit data from RabbitMQ "on live".</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>import pika  conn = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(     host='x.x.x.x')) channel = conn.channel() result = channel.queue_declare(exclusive=True) queue_name = result.method.queue channel.queue_bind(exchange='events', queue=queue_name, routing_key='#')  def callback(ch, method, propeties, body):     print " [x] Receive %r" % (body,)  channel.basic_consume(callback, queue_name, no_ack=True) channel.start_consuming() </code></pre>  <p>So what it does, it receive messages from server and print it. But how I can pass or pipe this messages to other functions and do my stuff? Should I do all that stuff only in callback function? Generally I just want edit data from RabbitMQ, do some if/else's and pass them further. Hope I describe my problem more or less ok.</p>
