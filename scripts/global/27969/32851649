<p>I come from a RabbitMQ background, and with RabbitMQ, you can set up exchanges that route messages to different queues based on a routing key.</p>  <p>In Kafka, how I am currently understanding topics is that they can be thought of as queues (that never get emptied). However, I am interested in putting different messages into different topics based on a certain criteria, and I would like to avoid doing that logic on the producer side.</p>  <p>Are there Kafka equivalent(s) to RabbitMQ's exchanges? </p>
