<p>I implemented multiple consumers, who are fetching messages from a single queue,  I am doing this using something similar to <a href="http://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/blocking_basic_get.html" rel="nofollow">this example</a>, except that I'm doing basic.get on an infinite loop for polling.</p>  <p>Any idea how do I prevent racing between all consumers, in that only one consumer will get the message and the other will continue to do polling until another message comes?<br> I trying to follow a logic in which as soon as I get the message I ack it for the message to be removed, but its seems that some other queues, manage to get the message also before the first has ack and removed the message. So everyone got this message.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
