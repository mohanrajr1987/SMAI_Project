<p>I'm pretty confused between the two methods of working with <code>rabbitmq's</code> <code>pika</code> library.    </p>  <p>The first is <a href="http://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/blocking_consume.html" rel="nofollow">Blocking consume</a><br> Second is <a href="http://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/blocking_basic_get.html" rel="nofollow">Blocking basic_get</a><br> Can someone please explain in further details about the differences?  </p>  <p>Is the difference that Blocking consume is getting messages out of the queue all the time if being sent to, while in the basic_get, we can control more when to get messages out of the queue?</p>
