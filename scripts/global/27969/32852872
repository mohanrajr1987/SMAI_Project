<p>I have installed RabbitMQ on my laptop. I start the server (<code>rabbitmq-server -detached</code>) and then <code>rabbitmqctl start_app</code>, and things work fine (my Java application can connect and send/receive messages). </p>  <pre><code>$ rabbitmqctl start_app Starting node 'rabbit@11-020-7206' ... </code></pre>  <p>But when I go to another place, where the network is different, the laptop gets another hostname and I cannot do anything with it anymore. If I try to stop or start it, I get an error that node is down. </p>  <pre><code>$ rabbitmqctl stop Stopping and halting node 'rabbit@Mahdis-MacBook-Pro' ... Error: unable to connect to node 'rabbit@Mahdis-MacBook-Pro': nodedown  DIAGNOSTICS ===========  attempted to contact: ['rabbit@Mahdis-MacBook-Pro']  rabbit@Mahdis-MacBook-Pro:   * connected to epmd (port 4369) on Mahdis-MacBook-Pro   * epmd reports node 'rabbit' running on port 25672   * TCP connection succeeded but Erlang distribution failed   * suggestion: hostname mismatch?   * suggestion: is the cookie set correctly?   * suggestion: is the Erlang distribution using TLS?  current node details: - node name: 'rabbitmq-cli-14528@Mahdis-MacBook-Pro' - home dir: /Users/mahdi - cookie hash: HBqyY/jYPLAyrH1wt3dTWQ== </code></pre>  <p>If I try to start the server altogether, it says node is running:</p>  <pre><code>$ rabbitmq-server -detached Warning: PID file not written; -detached was passed.
