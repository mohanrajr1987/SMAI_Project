<p>I am trying to use RabbitMQ to send messages to users on a website. While I know how to communicate between different scripts I can't find anything about how I can get a new user to recieve messages.</p>  <p>Let's take chapter 1 of the tutorial as example: <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html</a></p>  <p>How would I be able to send "Hello World" to a user on my website and be displayed in the console? Would it even be possible using python?</p>
