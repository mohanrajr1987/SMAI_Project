<p>I want to consume the messages in my Storm Spout from a rabbitMq Queue.</p>  <p>Now , we are using Spring AMQP to send and receive messages from RabbitMq asynchronously.</p>  <p>Spring AMQP provides mechanism(either creating a listener or using annotation @RabbitListner)  to read message from the queue .</p>  <p>The problem is I can have a Listener to read the message from the Queue. But how do I send this message to my Storm Spout which is running on storm cluster ? </p>  <p>The topology will start a cluster, but in my nextTuple() method of my spout , I need to read message from this Queue. Can Spring AMQP be used here ? </p>  <p>I have a listener configured to read message from the queue:</p>  <pre><code>@RabbitListener(queues = "queueName") public void processMessage(QueueMessage message) {  }  </code></pre>  <p>How can the above message received at the listener be sent to my spout running on a cluster .</p>  <p>Alternatively , how can a spout's nextTuple() method have this method inside it ? Is it possible </p>  <p>I am using Java as a language here.</p>
