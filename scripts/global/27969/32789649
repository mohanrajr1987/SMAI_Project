<p>Travis-CI wants people to migrate to their new container based system and stop using sudo.  Accorting to their documentation (<a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#RabbitMQ" rel="nofollow">http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#RabbitMQ</a>), to add more vhosts and users, I just add it to the before_script.  It works great using sudo, but without sudo it doesn't work.</p>  <p>Any ideas how I'm supposed to use their new container based system without sudo, but still add vhosts and users?</p>  <p>My travis.yml script:</p>  <pre><code>before_script:   - sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost "example_testbed" </code></pre>
