<p>I use nservicebus with rabbitmq. When I Send(command) to rabbitmq I can see that message goes to my queue QUEUE_NAME@PC_Name.</p>  <p>I also have IHandleMessages&lt;> for my command. However my command never handled. First question "What's wrong"?. Why handler not fired?</p>  <p>Also I download nservicebus sources from github and try to find place where Handler should be executed. Am I right that PipelineExecutor.Execute&lt;> push message to queue and after that pop it?</p>  <p>BR, Igor</p>
