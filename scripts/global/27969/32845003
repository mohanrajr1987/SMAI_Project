<p>We're developing an InternetOfThings application. Actually we get the data from the device and send to EventHub on Azure. We could have a lot of connection problems on the field, sometimes offline periods that can even last for days. Is there a library to store and forward our messages and forward to eventhub when possible? We hear about rabbitmq but here the volume of data is huge (near 3/4 gb per day). Is it capable to manage that volumes? Have someone expirience in a similar scenario?</p>
