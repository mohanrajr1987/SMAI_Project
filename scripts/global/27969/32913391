<p>I have RabbitMQ 3.5.5 installed on a Windows 2008 R2 server as a Windows service. Everything is as default. The log location is at C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Roaming\RabbitMQ\log and I can see 2 log files:</p>  <ol> <li>rabbit@HOSTNAME.log</li> <li>rabbit@HOSTNAME-sasl.log</li> </ol>  <p>However, they are always empty though RabbitMQ seems to be working fine; i.e., I can log into the web management console, add/delete users, publish/get messages. </p>  <p>Why are the logs empty? What am I missing?</p>
