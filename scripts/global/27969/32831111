<p>I'm running celery on multiple servers, each with a concurrency of 2 or more and  I want to load balance celery tasks so that the server that has the lowest CPU usage can process my celery tasks.</p>  <p>For example, lets say I have 2 servers (A and B), each with a concurrency of 2, if I have 2 tasks in the queue, I want A to process one task and B to process the other. But currently its possible that the first process on A will execute one task and the second process on A will execute the second task while B is sitting idle.</p>  <p>Is there a simple way, by means of celery extensions or config, that I can route tasks to the server with lowest CPU usage?</p>
