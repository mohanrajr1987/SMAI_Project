<p>This is bugging me for a while, in rabbitMQ I keep getting:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The management statistics database currently has a queue of [some number] events to process. If this number keeps increasing, so will the memory used by the management plugin. You may find it useful to set the rates_mode config item to none.</p> </blockquote>  <p>My applications requires the management part to get the current queue names. so I can't just stop it.</p>  <p>but how can I do it without breaking the current queues in rabbitMQ?</p>
