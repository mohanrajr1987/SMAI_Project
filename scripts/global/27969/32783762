<p>I would like to use CF release of rabbit-mq and provide more BOSH release/deployment defined broker users ( for sake of tracing issues)</p>  <p>Is there a way to provide so ? Currently i'm using stock release <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf/cf-rabbitmq-release" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pivotal-cf/cf-rabbitmq-release</a>  and in deployment i declare single user ?</p>  <pre><code> properties:   rabbitmq-server:     plugins:     - rabbitmq_management     administrators:       broker:         username: foo      #user to read and send events         password: bar </code></pre>  <p>Regards </p>
