<p>I am new to <code>nhibernate</code> and I am building a client-server application. I've heard that to create a nhinernate <code>ISessionFactory</code> it's better if I create it only once. But it will impact the database as well ? or just the workstation where the software is running ? I am asking it because if it was 3-tier application, then I will have only one nhinernate but, as my application is client-server, the software will run on each workstation. So each workstation will create once a nhinernate <code>ISessionFactory</code>.</p>
