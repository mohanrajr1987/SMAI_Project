<p>I'm trying to add "OPTION(RECOMPILE)" to the end of some of my NHibernate queries. I found the following post:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/07/23/use-sql-server-query-hints-with-nhibernate-hql-and-icriteria/" rel="nofollow">http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/07/23/use-sql-server-query-hints-with-nhibernate-hql-and-icriteria/</a></p>  <p>This describes how I can add an interceptor to append the SQL. However they are using ICriteria whereas I use LINQ to query my data. Ideally I'd like to be able to say something like:</p>  <pre><code>var query = session.Query&lt;Foo&gt;().OptionRecompile().ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>I was wondering if it's possible to add an extension method to IQueryable which will inject some string into the query which I can then detect for in my interceptor. This is similar to the approach used in the article above where they add a comment and detect for that.</p>  <p>For further information. I've dealt with LINQ extensions before and I know you can add extension properties/methods using a HQL generator. But from my understanding this will only allow me to say:</p>  <pre><code>var query = session.Query&lt;Foo&gt;().Where(f =&gt; f.Bar.OptionRecompile()).ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>This isn't ideal and seems more of a hack. I'd appreciate it if someone can help. Thanks</p>
