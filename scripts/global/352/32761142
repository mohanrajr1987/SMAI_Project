<p>We have a project that uses NHibernate with Spring.net. All the configuration for NHibernate is inside an XML file that spring uses for configuration.</p>  <p>I know that when configuring from code I can use the <code>BeforeBindMapping</code> event. I would like to use this event when configuring from XML using Spring.net (moving our current system to configure from code is not an option at the moment).</p>  <p>Can I somehow configure the <code>BeforeBindMapping</code> in XML? or maybe intervene in code?</p>
