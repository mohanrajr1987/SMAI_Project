<p>We have a project that uses NHibernate as the ORM. The project is designed to work on both SQL Server and Oracle (depending on the choices of the companies where the product is install). <strong>We need to support both SQL Server and Oracle</strong>.</p>  <p>In some cases we need to save DateTime fields with milliseconds so on Oracle the column type is <code>Date</code> and on SQL Server we use <code>datetime2</code>.</p>  <p>This is an example hbm:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns="urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2" assembly="NHibernateDatetimeTest" namespace="NHibernateDatetimeTest"&gt;   &lt;class name="User" table="Users"&gt;     &lt;id name="UserId" column="ID" type="int"&gt;     &lt;/id&gt;      &lt;property name="Name" column="NAME" /&gt;     &lt;property name="RegistratrionDate" column="RegDate" /&gt;   &lt;/class&gt; &lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When selecting from the database, all dates are presented as they should.</p>  <p>However, when I insert new data to SQL Server the date is saved without milliseconds. But if I change my hbm and specifying a type it work fine on SQL Server:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;property name="RegistratrionDate" column="RegDate" type="datetime2" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that Oracle doesn't know what datetime2 is and throws an exception.</p>  <p>Is there any way to support both platforms and still have SQL Server save milliseconds?</p>
