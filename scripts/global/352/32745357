<p>I am writing a comercial application using c# / nhibernate and posgresql. I have a few questions regarding it. This application first will be developer to work as client-server architecture, because I have small clients that has only a few workstation on their office. Like 1-15 computers. And they don't want to spend money with hardware.</p>  <p>1-) Will nhibernate handles client-server application well ? Or better to use ADO.NET directly ?</p>  <p>2-) The server will work pretty much as a database server only. So all workstation will connect to this postgresql server. Do I need any special configuration on postgresql to support this old client-server architecture ? </p>  <p>Thanks for the help</p>
