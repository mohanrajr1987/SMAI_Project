<p>I want to join two tables in NHibernate 2.1 with the xml mapping.</p>  <p>The parent class (Table1) has a property that is a List of the other class (Table2).</p>  <p>Now class1 has two properties that I want two join with class2.</p>  <p>These are the tables I tried to simplify for this example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qIJFJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qIJFJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So class1 should be like:</p>  <pre><code>public class class1{     public IList&lt;class2&gt; Class2Items{ get; set;} } </code></pre>  <p>Like I said, this is a simplified example, so I don't want to mirror the properties from class2 to class1. I want a List of class2 elements in class1. The join would be for 'Type' and 'Number'.</p>
