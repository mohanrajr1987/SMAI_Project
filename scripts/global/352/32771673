<p>I have a web app and a Azure DB. My web app uses NHibernate to save data to the database via <code>.Save()</code> using <code>ISession</code>. I'm looping and calling <code>.Save</code> on a number of entities, these can be arbitrary...however many is sent by the client (e.g. it can be 500). </p>  <p>I had read previously that I can use Transactions to speed up the actual commits to the DB..but I do not know <em>if or how</em> these "transactional" actions can be performed. </p>  <p>This is just a snippet of how I'm actually calling <code>.SaveOrUpdate</code>. Pretty basic stuff, but I could be wrong: </p>  <pre><code>if (tblSentEmailsRecordToBeUpdated != null) {        //Need to update the record for 'blnOutlookRec' &amp; update the database                       tblSentEmailsRecordToBeUpdated.blnOutlookRec = true;       _session.SaveOrUpdate(tblSentEmailsRecordToBeUpdated);       blnOutlookReceivedConfirmed = true;  } else {      blnOutlookReceivedConfirmed = false; //If the record is null that means that the record hasn't been found! } </code></pre>  <p>Any help/suggestions/advice on speeding this up would help! Thanks! </p>
