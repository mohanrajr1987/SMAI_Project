<p>I have a unusual problem with a window that I host in a panel. In my program there are some external applications that need to be hosted in panel. In order to host these applications I use the method SetParent(IntPtr child, IntPtr parent).</p>  <p>It is working well for all external applications but one. Once parent is changed for that application, it appears in my panel. I can move, minimize and then restore its window. However once I try to resize it - by either maximizing, or changing its bounds - it disappears. </p>  <p>What can I do to fix this issue?</p>  <p>Update: I've managed to get WINDOWPLACEMENT information that may be relevant to the problem:</p>  <p>1) When it works:</p>  <p>ptMinPosition X= -1 Y =-1</p>  <p>ptMaxPosition X= -1 Y =-1</p>  <p>rcNormalPosition X=158 Y=280 Width=2094 Height=1336</p>  <p>2)Not working - maximized:</p>  <p>ptMinPosition X=0 Y=555</p>  <p>ptMaxPosition X=4100 Y=7272</p>  <p>rcNormalPosition X=4 Y=2 Width=1940 Height = 1058</p>  <p>3)Not working - resize:</p>  <p>ptMinPosition X=-1 Y=-1</p>  <p>ptMaxPosition X=-1 Y=-1</p>  <p>rcNormalPosition X=4758 Y=7929 Width=6694 Height = 8986</p>  <p>Hence, it seems that this is due to window positioning. Is there a way to lock maximal available bounds? For example taking into account the parent panel size?</p>
