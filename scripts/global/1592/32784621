<p>It has cost me a lot of hours. Want to know if others have been confronted with the same issue.</p>  <p>I am developing this Swift/ObjC Hybrid project which is using GoogleMap iOS SDK. Note that I am using Cocoa Pod to manage the library reference. (I don't know whether it would cost any issue).</p>  <p>So I have checked the standard Apple document on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-ID138" rel="nofollow">"Mix and Match"</a> which give all the standard steps to cross reference between Objc and Swift.</p>  <p>I have checked this popular <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24206732/cant-use-swift-classes-inside-objective-c">StackOverFlow thread</a> for troubleshooting the potential issues.</p>  <p>I have created a very simple ObjC project and successfully referenced the Swift Class into my Objective C based ViewController.</p>  <p>BUT!!! I am not able to do it in the project I am actively working with. Here are the screenshot of the project. If anyone knows anything please help me.
