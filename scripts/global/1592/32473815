<p>I have a project written in C# using the <code>Interop.Excel</code> functionality. The method <code>Worksheet.SaveAs("file.csv", ...)</code> works differently in relation to the .NET Framework the project is built for. </p>  <ul> <li>When compiled for .NET Framework 3.5, the method saves a CSV file using semicolon (<code>;</code>) as delimiter (that is what I need). </li> <li>When compiled for .NET Framework 4, it uses comma (<code>,</code>) as delimiter, without any other changes in the code.</li> </ul>  <p>Can anybody explain what is happening? And how can I force excel to always use a semicolon as delimiter in CSV files, independently of the target .NET Framework?</p>
