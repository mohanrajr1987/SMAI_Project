<p>I have a <code>DLL</code> in <code>C#</code>, which accepts an integer array as an argument, and returns another. This<code>DLL</code> is loaded by an <code>unmanaged</code> application through <code>CO</code>M. </p>  <p>However, I am not able to pass an integer array from <code>C++</code> to <code>C#</code> via <code>COM</code>. The function signature converts the input integer array to <code>long</code>, and the return parameter to <code>long</code> as well, just variables, not <code>pointers</code>.</p>  <p>I have a feeling I am overlooking something fundamental here, but being new to <code>COM</code>, I am not able to figure out why it happens so.</p>
