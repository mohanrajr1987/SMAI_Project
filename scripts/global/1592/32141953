<p>I'm building a c# program that uses a local SQLite database to manage some simple data. </p>  <p>I am using the NuGet System.Data.SQLite (x64/x86) v1.0.98.0 - downloaded using the package manager console in Visual Studio Community 2015. Windows 7 64-bit.</p>  <p>I've built and debugged my code using the "Any CPU", x64, and x86 settings and it works fine. After I publish any of these versions though, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>An unhandled exception of type 'System.DllNotFoundException' occurred in System.Data.SQLite.dll Additional information: Unable to load DLL 'SQLite.Interop.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E) </code></pre>  <p>The error occurs here:</p>  <pre><code>SQLiteConnection.CreateFile("local-db.sqlite"); sqlite = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=local-db.sqlite;Version=3;"); //Error on this line </code></pre>  <p>Suggestions that haven't worked:</p>  <ul> <li>copying the bin/debug/x64 (and x86) folders (They contain versions of Interop.dll) up one directory </li> <li>add SQLite.Interop.dll as a project reference (error - can't add as a reference)</li> <li>add to project as existing item, set property "Copy to output directory = always". (still gets original error)</li> <li>copying the most recent version of Interop.dll to the System.Data.SQLite directory (the directory referenced by my project)</li> </ul>  <p>At the very least, it's not failing to load the .dll but failing to <strong>find</strong> it. I don't know my way around dll's but it might work if I know where it's looking. Does anyone have a fix for this? There are a handful of related questions but they are either unanswered or don't work for me.</p>
