<p>I have a c# interop class with this property:</p>  <pre><code>decimal ImportoDocumento { [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Struct)] get; [param: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Struct)] set; } </code></pre>  <p>In vb6 it should be a Variant/Decimal.  If i try to use it, it works. I can assign a value and i can get its value. The problem is that the vb6 intellisense doesn't work. I can see the other properties of the class but not ImportoDocumento. The intellisense is important because this class is used from other people.</p>  <p>How can i do?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
