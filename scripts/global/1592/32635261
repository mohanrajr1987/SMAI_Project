<p>I stumbled across some interesting documentation regarding PICK programming: </p>  <p><a href="http://www.d3ref.com/?token=flash.basic" rel="nofollow">http://www.d3ref.com/?token=flash.basic</a></p>  <p>It says FlashBASIC is a compiled, instead of interpreted, version of PICK programs that are interoperable with PICK. This is great. I am curious about how it describes Object code:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>converts Pick/BASIC source code into a list of binary instructions   called object code.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is this object code interoperable with other languages? Or is it limited to the PICK &amp; Universe operating environment? In other words <strong>could a C program call a FlashBASIC program?</strong></p>  <p>This is helpful in defining the C version, but cannot find any clear definition of the FlashBasic version:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7718299/whats-an-object-file-in-c">What&#39;s an object file in C?</a></p>
