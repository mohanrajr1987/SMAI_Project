<p>I'm running into an SEHException when trying to install an app from a shared web server onto a Virtual Desktop Image.  The error details I am seeing is;</p>  <pre><code>ERROR DETAILS Following errors were detected during this operation. * [9/25/2015 11:47:39 AM] System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException     - External component has thrown an exception.     - Source: System.Deployment     - Stack trace:         at System.Deployment.Internal.Isolation.IsolationInterop.GetUserStore(UInt32 Flags, IntPtr hToken, Guid&amp; riid)         at System.Deployment.Application.ComponentStore..ctor(ComponentStoreType storeType, SubscriptionStore subStore)         at System.Deployment.Application.SubscriptionStore..ctor(String deployPath, String tempPath, ComponentStoreType storeType)         at System.Deployment.Application.SubscriptionStore.get_CurrentUser()         at System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationActivator.PerformDeploymentActivation(Uri activationUri, Boolean isShortcut, String textualSubId, String deploymentProviderUrlFromExtension, BrowserSettings browserSettings, String&amp; errorPageUrl)         at System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationActivator.ActivateDeploymentWorker(Object state)  COMPONENT STORE TRANSACTION DETAILS No transaction information is available. </code></pre>  <p>Installing onto a local PC on the network these work perfectly fine, and the VDI has access to these shared network drives, but no avail.  I've also put the shared files onto C: drive of the VDI to see if that would help, but didn't do anything.  I've been searching through quite a bit about these exceptions but nothing has worked for me yet.</p>
