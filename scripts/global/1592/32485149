<p>I'm really new at this. I need to specify a range of continuous cells in a worksheet, of which I only know the first one. Ordinarily, for a fixed number of cells, I use (as an example for 13 continuous cells):</p>  <pre><code>Excel::Range^ er7 = Wsheet1-&gt;Range["H8:H20", Type::Missing];  er7-&gt;Formula = "=SUM(E8:G8)/3"; </code></pre>  <p>and it works.</p>  <p>Now, I want the last cell of the range (the H20) to be a function of the number of items listed in the worksheet. Something like, for instance,  <code>H8+k</code> (k being a known integer, of course).</p>  <p>Can you, PLEASE, help? THANK YOU</p>  <p>P.S. I'm coding in c++/cli but have borrowed from examples I've found in c#.</p>
