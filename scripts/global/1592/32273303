<p>I have two functions in Objective-C code declared with <code>__attribute__((overloadable))</code> attribute. I could normally call these functions from Objective-C code. I have not overloaded functions in same Objective-C file which I could normally call from both Objective-C and Swift. But when I call these overloaded functions from Swift, I can't even build project getting linker error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PIvjl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PIvjl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Xcode 6.4.</p>  <p>What's wrong with calling overloaded Objective-C functions from Swift? Bug? Should I file radar?</p>
