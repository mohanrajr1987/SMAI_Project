<p>I have a. net 4.6 class library with the wrap folder configuration which includes the project.json which is configured to point to the compiled <em>bin/obj/[output] .dll</em> and <em>.pdb</em> files and the global.json in the .csproj root. </p>  <p>This was configured automatically via adding the .csproj reference in the asp. net 5 class project. </p>  <p>However the local package folder in <em>c:\user\.dnx\packages</em> is not being created thus the output states <strong>the package could not be found</strong>. </p>  <p>I am using the beta7 release version of dnx that was released yesterday. </p>  <p><strong>Things I have tried</strong></p>  <p>I have tried running <em>dnu restore</em> from the command line with the same output result. </p>  <p>I have updated to the latest beta 7 web tool for vs 2015 and updated to the latest dnvm. </p>  <p>Anyone else ran into this issue? </p>
