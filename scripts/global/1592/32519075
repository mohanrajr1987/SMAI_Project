<p>I am trying to open Office Word's Spelling and Grammar check window into Powerpoint file. Word's spelling and grammar window opens whenever it finds wrong spelling or incorrect grammar.<br> But grammar &amp; spelling dialog box hides behind another window. User has to find that dialog box by pressing ALT+Tab. I have developed my code in .Net [windows form application] using Office API.</p>
