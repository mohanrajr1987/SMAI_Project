<p>Trying to <code>SELECT</code> a row in my excel file. I'm using it as a database. I'm pretty sure the problem is either in my query or in my excel file.</p>  <p><code>SELECT * FROM [tableName$] where _columnNum1 = 'testData123'"</code></p>  <p>I've tried doing this code for a while</p>  <p><code>SELECT * FROM [tableName$]</code></p>  <p>and it worked. So every time I add a <code>WHERE</code> clause, it causes the error. What seems to be the problem here?</p>  <p>The error says <code>Syntax error in query expression '_columnNum1 = 'testData123''</code></p>  <p>UPDATE: I forgot to add this, I've already googled this thing for some time now, and the error is about data types. But since I'm using excel as a database, I can't really manipulate data types around them. Or can I? Anyway maybe the error is about data types. </p>
