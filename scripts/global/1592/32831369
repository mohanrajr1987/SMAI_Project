<p>Office used to provide interop dlls that would allow developers to control office applications from c# code. For instance, advance a powerpoint presentation from an external application.</p>  <p>here is an example: <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/office/how-to-automate-control-23cd2a8f" rel="nofollow">https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/office/how-to-automate-control-23cd2a8f</a></p>  <p>I was wondering if this is still possible in Office 2016. I can't seem to find the Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.dll or similar anywhere in my computer. They used to be found in "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OfficeXX".</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Pol</p>
