<p>I have a sticky header (position: fixed) inside and iFrame. The header stays sticky when the page is viewed alone. Unfortunately the page gets served up in an iFrame and I have no control over the parent page.</p>  <p>The sticky header when viewed inside the iFrame on iOS just scrolls with the rest of the page being iFramed in.</p>  <p>Any way to fix this? Everything I have read says to set the height and width of the iFrame to 100% but I can't access or change the iFrame code.</p>
