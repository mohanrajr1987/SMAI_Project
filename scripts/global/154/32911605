<p>Okay, so I've uploaded a new app to testflight and succsesfully added one internal tester.</p>  <p>But now, I just can't add more internal testers for my new build (and for old too). First of all I've invited all my testers using "users and roles". They have accepted my invintations. And I've assigned them as my internal testers clicking directly on their e-mails in my users list.</p>  <p>But when I navigate to "my Apps" -> my app -> "test flight" -> "internal testing" my "Add" button is grayed out.</p>  <p>Here is some screenshots:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g88mU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g88mU.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OFaFH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OFaFH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So what have I done wrong, or is it some "internal" testflight bug?</p>  <p>PS. Processing has been finished about 8 hours ago. And I can't even add new testers to my old build where I already have one internal tester.</p>
