<p>I would just like to return the value "air_temp" from the first set of data "sort_order": 0. From here: <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDV60901/IDV60901.95936.json" rel="nofollow">http://www.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDV60901/IDV60901.95936.json</a></p>  <p>I have very basic knowledge of iOS Swift, but was hoping this would be a basic question for somebody to quickly answer here.</p>  <p>I've found some tutorials online but they are a bit confusing and seem to provide help for more complicated scenarios.</p>  <p>Any basic tutorial link, or example project, or if somebody here could quickly help me, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>
