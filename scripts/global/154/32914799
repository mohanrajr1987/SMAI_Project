<p>I have an UISearchBar in on top of my TVC. If the search is active it displays another tableView on top of the normal tableView (this is normal). Now i need to get the "searchTableView" in prepareForSegue() because I need to call:</p>  <pre><code>var newIndexPath = table.indexPathForSelectedRow! </code></pre>  <p>and this fails if you search something. I also can't do the decision in didSelectRowAtIndexPath() because the segue is called to fast because it is 'linked' directly to the UITableViewCell. I also tried to create the segue from the ViewController but this also fails because the segue needs to end on the same ViewController again. </p>  <p>So basically I want to ask if anyone knows how to solve the error in the Code line above will doing a search.</p>
