<p>I have a BLE device that I connect with my application. I have managed to auto-connect to it the first time the application is used and I have also managed to make the application work if the device gets turned off and then on again. BUT the last one works only if the device gets turned off for like less than 20-30 minutes.</p>  <p>If I turn on the device in less than 30 minutes the application will reconnect to it automatically and read its data. But after 30 minutes although when I turn on the device it appears to reconnect to the iPhone, the application does seem to reconnect to it and read data.</p>  <p>Any suggestions, hints or tips? Thank you all in advance.</p>  <hr>  <p>EDIT: adding some code as requested</p>  <pre><code>/*  Invoked whenever an existing connection with the peripheral is torn down.  Reset local variables  */ - (void)centralManager:(CBCentralManager *)central didDisconnectPeripheral:(CBPeripheral *)aPeripheral error:(NSError *)error {     self.connected = NO;      if( self.peripheral )     {         [self.peripheral setDelegate:nil];         self.peripheral = nil;     }     [self.centralManager scanForPeripheralsWithServices:@[myService] options:@{ CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey : @YES }]; } </code></pre>
