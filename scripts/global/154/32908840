<p>I'm trying to submit my iphone app using the altool. However, the following error is being prompted:</p>  <pre><code>altool[18508:507] *** Error: (     "Error Domain=ITunesConnectFoundationErrorDomain Code=-27000 \"The Info.plist in the package must contain the CFBundleIdentifier key.\" UserInfo=0x7f {NSLocalizedDescription=The Info.plist in the package must contain the CFBundleIdentifier key., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Unable to validate your application.}",     "Error Domain=ITunesConnectFoundationErrorDomain Code=-27001 \"The Info.plist in the package must contain the CFBundleVersion key.\" UserInfo=0x7f {NSLocalizedDescription=The Info.plist in the package must contain the CFBundleVersion key., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Unable to validate your application.}",     "Error Domain=ITunesConnectFoundationErrorDomain Code=-27002 \"The Info.plist in the package must contain the CFBundleShortVersionString key.\" UserInfo=0x7f {NSLocalizedDescription=The Info.plist in the package must contain the CFBundleShortVersionString key., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Unable to validate your application.}",     "Error Domain=ITunesConnectFoundationErrorDomain Code=-27000 \"The package does not contain an Info.plist.\" UserInfo=0x7f{NSLocalizedDescription=The package does not contain an Info.plist., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Unable to validate your application.}" </code></pre>  <p>I already verified that such keys (<code>CFBundleIdentifier</code>, <code>CFBundleVersion</code>, <code>CFBundleShortVersionString</code>) are in the Info.plist. In addition, I opened the Payload from the .ipa file (generated with xcodebuild and xcrun - command line) and could confirm that such keys also are in the Info.plist file.</p>  <p>The validation pass when I use the XCode to compile, archive and submit.</p>  <p>Any help?</p>  <p>My Xcode Version: 6.1.1 (6A2008a) OSX 10.9.5</p>
