<p>So I'm having this app on the app store since 2010, and my initalization code since that time looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];     self.window.rootViewController = someViewController;    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; } </code></pre>  <p>Now this worked until yesterday, but since I today updated to XCode 7 and iOS9, I'm having some issues. My app still launches in the simulator, but <strong>no matter what iPhone device I pick</strong>, I will get a window size of {320, 480}.</p>  <p>What is the proper way to do it?</p>  <p>[edit] More details:   </p>  <ul> <li>everything was fine with XCode 6 / iOS 8    </li> <li>see screenshot of how it looks now in iPhone 5S simulator. I get the same black back on the bottom of the view (my macbook screen wont fit the whole simulator window for a screenshot)</li> <li>as I see it, I dont have any launch image assigned at the moment. will this be the solution? if so, what size should I provide? do I need launch images for all iPhones? (4S, 5, 6, 6+)</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cVTYb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cVTYb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
