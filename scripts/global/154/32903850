<p>I have developed an application that has the capability to update the location on server while application is in background as well as foreground. I have used Timer which continuously updates location with 1 minute time interval, because if the interval is more than 1 minute , <code>iOS</code> suspends the application in background.</p>  <p>The problem is with iOS 9, when application is in background, some time it stops the location update and after some random time duration it again starts.</p>  <p>These are the crash logs which I found from device logs.</p>  <pre><code>Exception Type:  00000020     Exception Codes: 0x000000008badf00d     Exception Note:  SIMULATED (this is NOT a crash)     Highlighted by Thread:  2      Application Specific Information:     &lt;BKNewProcess: 0x15646220; com.com.com; pid: 1168; hostpid: -1&gt; has active assertions beyond permitted time:      {(         &lt;BKProcessAssertion: 0x15537b80&gt; id: 1168-1B744B09-0EB7-4B01-A6FE-F167669E4439 name: Called by UIKit, from &lt;redacted&gt; process: &lt;BKNewProcess: 0x15646220; com.com.com; pid: 1168; hostpid: -1&gt; permittedBackgroundDuration: 180.000000 reason: finishTask owner pid:1168 preventSuspend  preventIdleSleep  preventSuspendOnSleep ,         &lt;BKProcessAssertion: 0x15643480&gt; id: 1168-59515322-D982-46F8-94A5-0DD259406664 name: Called by UIKit, from &lt;redacted&gt; process: &lt;BKNewProcess: 0x15646220; com.com.com; pid: 1168; hostpid: -1&gt; permittedBackgroundDuration: 180.000000 reason: finishTask owner pid:1168 preventSuspend  preventIdleSleep  preventSuspendOnSleep      )}     Elapsed total CPU time (seconds): 6.880 (user 6.880, system 0.000), 9% CPU      Elapsed application CPU time (seconds): 0.081, 0% CPU </code></pre>  <p>Note: Everything is working completely fine in iOS 7 and iOS 8.</p>  <p>I have tried couple of solutions available on stackoverflow but I am not able to figure out the exact solutions which can solve the problem.</p>  <p>Also I found that if I don't lock the device then the location update and web-service calling works fine but if the device is locked, it stops updating location and calling up web-service.</p>  <p>Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
