<p>I am developing an app where I am trying acheive uploading of good quality multiples images to server, method I am following is:</p>  <pre><code>1. Selecting N images on the iOS app 2. I inform server about the N images, inturn server creates N urls in amazon and return it to iOS app 3. I do a PUT call to upload images one by one to amazon from iOS app. 4. After uploading N images, I make a call to server with all the successful uploads URL. </code></pre>  <p>Problem with this synchronous approach is it involves N + 2 calls(not including retry for all the failed uploads) and also its takes lot of time in case if there are multiple images. also </p>  <p>Could you direct me to the efficient <b>approach to upload multiple images parallely so that it saves timing something like whatsapp</b> multiple images uploads? Thanks.</p>
