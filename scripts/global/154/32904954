<p>When I'm testing my iBeacon enabled iOS application for different scenarios with iOS 9, I've found that it doesn't discover the iBeacon for a quite a while after I toggle on Bluetooth.</p>  <p>Scenario is as follows, I kill my application, turn Bluetooth off and then lock the phone. Then I wake the phone via power button and in the lock screen I turn on Bluetooth via the Control Center and wait till the iBeacon monitoring starts. </p>  <p>In the device log I've noticed that the iBeacon monitoring is not started even after several attempts.</p>  <p>This scenario fails more often than not in an iPhone 5 which is updated to iOS 9.0.2. </p>  <p>I've tested this in several devices and in all iOS 8 devices I've tested it works fine.</p>  <p>Any sort of help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
