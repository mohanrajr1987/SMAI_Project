<p>I am not able to add peek and pop the <code>SBGestureTableView</code> library. The problem is that I am not sure what class should be instantiated with <code>UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate</code> and how to assign the peek and pop to the cell.</p>  <p>The URL of the library is: <a href="https://github.com/Stickbuilt/SBGestureTableView" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Stickbuilt/SBGestureTableView</a></p>  <p>Can you point me to the right direction? Could you please provide the basic code to add that functionality?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
