<p>In iOS 8 (maybe 7 too I can't recall) you can set default applications for navigation. I am currently implementing a button that allows a user to open up Apple Maps and get directions to a location the following way:</p>  <pre><code>- (IBAction)getDirections:(id)sender {  CLLocationCoordinate2D endingCoord = storeLocation; MKPlacemark *endLocation = [[MKPlacemark alloc] initWithCoordinate:endingCoord addressDictionary:nil]; MKMapItem *endingItem = [[MKMapItem alloc] initWithPlacemark:endLocation]; endingItem.name = @"Cubes Pizza Sunway";  NSMutableDictionary *launchOptions = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]; [launchOptions setObject:MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeDriving forKey:MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeKey];  [endingItem openInMapsWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions]; </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>This works great and launches how I'd expect. However, what if the user has Google Maps installed? Will Apple automatically give the user an option? Or do I need to implement an activity sheet and detect all the navigation apps and then figure out the URL schemas for each one?) </p>  <p>How would I go about implementing such a thing?</p>  <p>This is the same question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22767311/ios-run-3rd-party-navigation-app-from-code">iOS - run 3rd party navigation app from code</a> but it's a year old and wanted to know if this feature was implemented by APPLE and if not how to implement checking if app is installed etc. </p>
