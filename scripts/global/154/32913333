<p>I'm using the SDWebImage plugin and I have run into the following scenario: I have two <code>UIViewController</code>'s A and B. In <code>UIViewControllerB</code> I am loading a series of 10 - 15 images from the web in a UIImageView with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>UIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] init]; [imageView sd_setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:[sourceDictionary objectForKey:@"image"]]                   placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"placeholder"]]; </code></pre>  <p>This works well. Except that I begin downloading these images once the user loads <code>UIViewControllerB</code>. I was wondering if there was a way from me to begin to pre-cache or begin downloading these images while the user is still on <code>UIViewControllerA</code> so that when the user gets to <code>UIViewControllerB</code> they see a shorter delay? How would I do this in a manner so that the image isnt downloaded twice if the  user switches to the second viewcontroller while a download is taking place? </p>
