<p>I've created a leftbarbuttonItem programmatically bacause I need that button to be bigger than standard barButtonItem. And I want that button to perform a segue that would push our view to next ViewController.</p>  <p>Here is what I've added to my ViewDidLoad function in my first ViewController:</p>  <pre><code>let button: UIButton = UIButton(type: .Custom) as UIButton         button.setImage(UIImage(named: "Moroz.png"), forState: UIControlState.Normal)         button.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 40)          button.addTarget(self, action: "open", forControlEvents: .AllEvents)         let barButton = UIBarButtonItem(customView: button)         self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = barButton </code></pre>  <p>Here is the function "open" (I've placed it right after viewDidLoad ends, though I've tried to place it before and the result is still the same):</p>  <pre><code>func open(sender: AnyObject) {     self.performSegueWithIdentifier("toexpress", sender: sender) } </code></pre>  <p>I've created a segue "toexpress" by ctrl dragging from first ViewController to second one. And the identifier I've given to it is obviously "toexpress".</p>  <p>Here is the screenshot:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jz7nd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jz7nd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But every time I run my app and click on my button I get</p>  <pre><code>libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException(lldb)  </code></pre>  <p>If I use standard barButtonItem everything works fine, but that's not an option because I need it to be bigger.</p>  <p>Can anyone point out where I've made my mistake? Thank you!</p>
