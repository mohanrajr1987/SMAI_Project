<p>I implemented IQMediaPickerController in my application. When I load first time my application , it prompt by- "Would you like to access your photo", If i click on "Don't allow", then i got the below error [in image] </p>  <p>I want to direct access to my setting in iphone or any ios devices, without getting below error. So I just want to know where i have to change in my code? Or how should I implement this ??</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lBh4C.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lBh4C.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
