<p>this is my first post after mostly finding answers throughout my endeavours.</p>  <p>I have a dataModel simpleton that calls <code>NSUserDefaults.standardDefaults()</code> to get some identifiers (keys) I have set up on the <code>settings bundle</code>/<code>root.plist</code> file.</p>  <p>Here are some that I use:</p>  <pre><code>identifier string userName  identifier string userMessage </code></pre>  <p>both are text area style preferences with default values in them.</p>  <p>The <code>plist</code> is formatted correctly as it shows up in the app's settings in settings/my app with all the values as I want them.</p>  <p>However, these values don't show up in my declared variables or show a as nil.</p>  <p>The way I call them:</p>  <pre><code>var myUser:String = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().stringForKey("userName")  </code></pre>  <p>Same for message.</p>  <p>But when I print the result, I keep getting <code>null</code> values.</p>  <p>I followed a book on swift exactly to the letter but nothing that gives me any indication of where the issue is.</p>  <p>I have also tried printing <code>NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().dictionaryRepresentation().values</code> but it shows a completely different set of settings like ratings and such which mystifies me. </p>  <p>Any help greatly appreciated as I spent the day on this one.</p>
