<p>I want to add the new 3D/Force Touch feature (UIApplicationShortcutItem) to my app but I was wondering whether there is or isn't a limit to how many you can have on a single app?</p>  <p>I've had a look on the documentation but don't see a mention of a limit: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationShortcutItem_class/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationShortcutItem_class/</a></p>
