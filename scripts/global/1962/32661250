<p>this is the link for the debugger download: <br> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/</a> <br><br> I clicked on the first link and downloaded 7.10 but I'm not sure how to unpack this file extension gdb-7.10.tar.xz.sig. <br>I tried the following command which did not work <code>$ tar xf gdb-7.10.tar.xz</code>.</p>
