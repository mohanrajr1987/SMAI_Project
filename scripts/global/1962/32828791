<p>I have a C++ application that starts as single thread and processes some video frames. For each frame the application spawns 2 threads that join and this is done in a loop for each frame.</p>  <p>I'm trying to investigate whether there is another thread that I haven't detected. The application is quite complex and <em>loads shared libraries that may spawn threads of their own</em>.</p>  <p>I use <strong>gdb's info threads</strong> for that.</p>  <p>This is what I get:</p>  <pre><code>  Id   Target Id         Frame    7    Thread 0x7fffde7fc700 (LWP 16644) "my_debugged_process" sem_wait ()     at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/sem_wait.S:85   6    Thread 0x7fffdeffd700 (LWP 16643) "my_debugged_process" sem_wait ()     at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/sem_wait.S:85   5    Thread 0x7fffdf7fe700 (LWP 16642) "my_debugged_process" sem_wait ()     at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/sem_wait.S:85   4    Thread 0x7fffdffff700 (LWP 16641) "my_debugged_process" sem_wait ()     at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/sem_wait.S:85   3    Thread 0x7fffe4988700 (LWP 16640) "my_debugged_process" sem_wait ()     at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/sem_wait.S:85   2    Thread 0x7fffe5c0b700 (LWP 16639) "my_debugged_process" 0x00007ffff3dc812d in poll ()     at ../sysdeps/unix/syscall-template.S:81 * 1    Thread 0x7ffff7fc2800 (LWP 16636) "my_debugged_process" TheApplication::SomeClass::processFrame (this=0x743530, srcI=...,      dstI=...) at TheApplication.cpp:315 </code></pre>  <p>So the question is:</p>  <p><strong>What are the threads from 2 to 7? Are they somehow related to my process?</strong> I only recognize thread 1. </p>  <p>I see that they are all waiting for a semaphore so I'm inclined to say that they belong to the debugger.</p>
