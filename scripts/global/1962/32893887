<p>When debugging a C++ project in Eclipse I get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'Launching Project.exe' has encountered a problem.</p>      <p>Could not determine GDB version using command:</p>      <p>D:\Programme\MinGW\bin\gdb.exe --version</p> </blockquote>  <p>Some Posts on Stackoverflow suggested linking MinGW\bin\gdb.exe directly in the C++/GDB settings solves the problem, but as you can see it didn't for me. Any suggestions?</p>  <p>Edit: Tried <code>mingw-get.exe install gdb</code> in MinGW\bin, got an error that said the latest version is already installed.</p>
