<p>I am newbie on XV6 and currently trying to understand it working. I have successfully downloaded the source code,built the kernel using make and I am able to run it under qemu.</p>  <p>In xv6 folder I can see many executables like _cat,_sh,_rm etc. Out of curiosity I want to run one of these exe's in gdb directly without using qemu. As per my understanding,i cannot run the xv6's kernel executable directly in gdb as kernel requires raw x86 hardware to run and hence I have to run it through qemu as it will emulate the environment for the kernel.But,_cat or _rm are user programs and ideally should run in an isolate manner.I tried the below mentioned steps in gdb.</p>  <p>gdb _cat->break main->run</p>  <p>As soon as I run the exe,a SIGKILL is received and the exe terminates.Same happened with _rm and _sh.</p>  <p>Is my understanding wrong or am I missing out something? Some help will be useful.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
