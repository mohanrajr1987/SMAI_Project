<p>I would like to use eclipse to debug the C code of a JNI aplication I am writing. I have followed some tutorial and done the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Launch the Java program in debug mode</li> <li>Reach a breakpoint in Java code before calling loadLibrary()</li> <li>Run the "C/C++ attach to application" debug configuration in Eclipse by passing javaw.exe as a program to attach to</li> </ul>  <p>At this point I get an error window "gdborig.exe has stopped working" and the following output in the console:</p>  <pre><code>GNU gdb (GDB) 7.9.1 Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
