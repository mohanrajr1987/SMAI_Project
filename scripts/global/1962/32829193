<p>After searching around and trying different methods, I'm at a loss at how to get QtCreator to use gdb on a tablet. I'm using QtCreator 3.5.0, and my tablet is a Galaxy Tab S. When I try to debug my application on the tablet, I get "The selected build of GDB does not support Python scripting. It cannot be used in Qt Creator." To attempt to remedy this, I've tried downloading and building gdb using the "--with-python" flag, and setting up a debugger profile in QtCreator using it. I've done the same with gdb-multiarch, but I get the same result.  </p>  <p>My Build &amp; Run > Kits configuration is:<br> Device Type: Android Device<br> Device: Run on Android<br> Compiler: Android GCC (arm-4.8)<br> Debugger: <br> Qt version: Qt 5.5.0  </p>  <p>Is there something I need beyond a Python-enabled gdb, like some kind of library I don't know about? Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
