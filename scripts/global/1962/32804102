<p>Sometimes I am trying to debug a program in <code>gdb</code> and it takes it a while of running before the bug comes up.</p>  <p>While I'm waiting, I like to do other things. It would be nice if gdb could beep at me when an exception happens.</p>  <p>Is there a way to make gdb run an external command when an exception happens? Or a standard way to hook into gdb for this sort of thing?</p>
