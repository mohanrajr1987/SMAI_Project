<p>I've installed <strong>gdb</strong> formulae from Homebrew on OSX 10.10.5 to send a backtrace to developers of weechat (because <strong>weechat</strong> installed with Homebrew crashes every time I do <code>/exit</code>).</p>  <p>And got this problem when trying to read the core file:</p>  <pre><code>gdb /usr/local/bin/weechat /cores/core.70087 GNU gdb (GDB) 7.10 Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
