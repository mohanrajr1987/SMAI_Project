<p>The Intel <strong>icc</strong> compiler has a run-time check feature <code>-check-pointers=write</code> that does some sort of magic to check if a pointer writes beyond data it is supposed to. When I run this on my code, I get hundreds of these errors rolling by in <strong>gdb</strong>. I would like to have <strong>gdb</strong> break on the first instance of this error, but it is not implemented as an exception or signal, so <code>catch throw</code> or <code>catch signal</code> doesn't work, and I have no idea if there is a function name associated with this feature.</p>  <p>Is there any way to have the debugger "break" when the run-time checker hits it?</p>
