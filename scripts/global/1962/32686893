<p>I am running into some issues loading shared library files into gdb. I have tried every permutation I can think of. I have also tried the file command suggested online, but I still can not load the libraries...</p>  <pre><code>(gdb) file app/src/main/obj/local/armeabi/libUseTBT.so  Reading symbols from app/src/main/obj/local/armeabi/libUseTBT.so...done.
