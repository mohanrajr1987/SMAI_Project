<p>I'd like to subtract a fixed number from several stack or array entries. I'm thinking about something like:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;# What I can do. Stack values were changed to protect the innocents. &gt; x/4x $sp 0xffffcbbb:     0xfffffff8      0x00009942      0x00000001      0xffffccc4 &gt;# What I would like to do, notice all values are value-1 &gt; (x/4w $sp)-1 0xffffcbbb:     0xfffffff7      0x00009941      0x00000000      0xffffccc3 </code></pre>  <p>Obviously this syntax won't work like this, but I wonder if something like this is possible.</p>
