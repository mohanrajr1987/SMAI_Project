<p>How to run any debugger for Go package?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>I want to know what's inside of <code>broadcastwriter</code> package: <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/pkg/broadcastwriter/broadcastwriter.go" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/pkg/broadcastwriter/broadcastwriter.go</a></p>  <p>I run tests: <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/pkg/broadcastwriter/broadcastwriter_test.go" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/pkg/broadcastwriter/broadcastwriter_test.go</a></p>  <p>Tests pass</p>  <p>So my questions are:</p>  <ul> <li>How to set up a breakpoint and stop tests on it (for Gdb and Godebug)? </li> <li>Can debugger work without <code>main()</code> function (as described in README examples)?</li> </ul>
