<p>I am trying to troubleshoot a bus error with some inline SSE2 assembly. The source code has a macro that uses 5 pointers, and I suspect one of them is not aligned.</p>  <p>I set a breakpoint on the source line. But when I perform a <code>disass</code>, it disassembles from the top of the function, and not where the debugger is stopped. There are hundreds of lines of assembly, so its not really helpful to me. Pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> 30 to 40 times in response to "Press ENTER to continue" got old very quickly.</p>  <p>I tried a <code>disass $pc</code>, but it dsassembled from the top of the function. I also tried a <code>disass .</code> (with the dot meaning "here"), but that resulted in:</p>  <pre><code>A syntax error in expression, near `.'. </code></pre>  <p>What does GDB use to denote "here"?</p>
