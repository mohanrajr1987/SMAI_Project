<p>I am trying to debug Linux using gdb, I compiled kernel with "compile kernel with debug info".     once kernel is compiled I am trying to give      GDB file vmlinux     (running above command gives me below error)</p>  <pre><code> GNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.7.1-0ubuntu5~14.04.2) 7.7.1   Reading symbols from file...(no debugging symbols found)...done. "/home/Linux/vmlinux" is not a core dump: File format not recognized </code></pre>  <p>Even I am setting debug con-figs it is giving me "no debugging symbols found"</p>
