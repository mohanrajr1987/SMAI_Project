<p>I have the following code snippet thats causing me issues.</p>  <pre><code>0x0000000000401556 &lt;+56&gt;:   cmp    $0x37,%edx 0x0000000000401559 &lt;+59&gt;:   je     0x401560 &lt;phase_5+66&gt; 0x000000000040155b &lt;+61&gt;:   callq  0x401a64 &lt;do_not_come_here&gt; 0x0000000000401560 &lt;+66&gt;:   pop    %rbx 0x0000000000401561 &lt;+67&gt;:   retq  </code></pre>  <p>and here is part of the registers status on line +59, right before it either jumps or not.</p>  <pre><code>rax            0x6  6 rbx            0x6d97c0 7182272 rcx            0x3  3 rdx            0x21 37 rsi            0x6d97c0 7182272 rdi            0x6d97c6 7182278 </code></pre>  <p>Now obviously we want to jump over to line +66 and return. However, despite the fact that </p>  <pre><code>%rdx = 37 (hence %edx=37), </code></pre>  <p>the code doesn't jump and falls into "do_not_come_here".  My gdb reports that at the moment of jump, the flags that were set were</p>  <pre><code>eflags         0x297    [ CF PF AF SF IF ] </code></pre>  <p>I don't even have the ZF flag in there. What is going on? Please help me.</p>
