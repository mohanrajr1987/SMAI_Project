<p>I'm debugging a OpenCV app compiled with C++11 (I use OpenCV 2.4.10). The app has two threads that do some image processing on the CPU (no GPU functions used but I also included <code>libopencv_gpu.so</code> in the linked libraries).</p>  <p>Using gdb I noticed that instead of just two threads (the main process thread and another thread created by the main process thread) I found 3 threads running: </p>  <pre><code>(gdb) info threads  Id   Target Id         Frame  78   Thread 0x7fffe2ff5700 (LWP 20531) "app_name" 0x00007ffff5bb2f3d in nanosleep () at ../sysdeps/unix/syscall-template.S:81 2    Thread 0x7fffe3c42700 (LWP 20454) "app_name" 0x00007ffff5bdf12d in poll () at ../sysdeps/unix/syscall-template.S:81 * 1    Thread 0x7ffff7fab800 (LWP 20450) "app_name" 0x00007ffff5bb2f3d in nanosleep () at ../sysdeps/unix/syscall-template.S:81 </code></pre>  <p>Thread 1 and 78 (using gdb ID) are executing my code. I added a sleep call in each one so I can make sure that those are my threads. Thread 2 (using gdb ID) is created before entering the main function of the main process I believe. As far as I could debug this, thread with ID 2 just calls poll() function all the time.</p>  <p>I'm new to gdb and maybe you can tell me how to find out who creates this thread and what is it's purpose? Is this OpenCV related or C++11? When I compile the same app using Opencv4Tegra and run it on a Tegra K1 board, thread number 2 does not exist.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> This is the backtrace when creating thread number 2. It seems that libusb creates this but I don't know why yet:</p>  <pre><code>(gdb) backtrace #0  __pthread_create_2_1 (newthread=0x7fffea79c438, attr=0x0, start_routine=0x7fffea5941c0, arg=0x0) at pthread_create.c:466 #1  0x00007fffea5943df in ??
