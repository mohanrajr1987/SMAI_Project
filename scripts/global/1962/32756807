<p>My project loads a libray (compiled in debug mode) dynamically within the main thread with <code>dlopen</code> and then uses <code>dlsym</code> without problem. However, when running in debug mode with <strong>gdb 7.7.1+dfsg-5</strong>, it crashes. I see from kernel logs this error:</p>  <pre><code>gdb[8814]: segfault at 7fff4e019fa0 ip 0000000000718b95 sp 00007fff4e019f90 error 6 in gdb[400000+574000 </code></pre>  <p>This causes to me not able to use the debugger. Terrible!</p>  <p>What could I do to fix this?</p>  <p>My project has this complex structure. I know that it has rare structure but I am told to use external library as this.</p>  <pre><code>MAIN RUNNABLE (compiled with S1.so) | - SHARED_1 (S1.so) (compiled with s1.a, s2.a, s3.a)   |  - STATIC_1 (s1.a)        |  - dlopen S2.so and call functions from S2.so   |  - STATIC_2 (s2.a)   |  - STATIC_3 (s3.a) - DYNAMICALLY_LOADING_1 (S2.so) (compiled with s1.a, s2.a, s3.a)   |  - STATIC_1 (s1.a)   |  - STATIC_2 (s2.a)   |  - STATIC_3 (s3.a) </code></pre>
