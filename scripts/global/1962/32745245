<p>I'm running a server under gdb, and it's currently blocked in a call to select.</p>  <p>I want to make it return from select, after which I can manually modify the fd sets and see how execution continues.</p>  <p>I tried to put a breakpoint on the next line after the call to select(), and issued the command 'signal SIGINT', but that did nothing other than printing 'Continuing with signal SIGINT'.</p>  <p>edit: I'm actually debugging using vgdb, maybe that's the issue?</p>
