<p>I just downloaded KDevelop from Ubuntu Software Center, and have gcc.</p>  <p>I want to see anything happens by pressing F9 but KDevelop says I need to configure a launcher first. And all I know about the setting window is I have to put 'gcc' in somewhere on the window, as well as path to the source code file and path to the executable file it will make.</p>  <p>I have no any knowledge about this window, no any syntax to use in it and can't find it anywhere on the web. Now I desperately require some help. <strong>I want to make KDevelop to compile and debug with already-installed gcc and gdb.</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KovxC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KovxC.png" alt="Configuration Window."></a></p>
