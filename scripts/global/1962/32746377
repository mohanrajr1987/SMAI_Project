<p>I have a little issue. When I want debug some of my programms, I can set breakpoint i.e.<code>Function "strcpy" not defined. Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y Breakpoint 2 (strcpy) pending.</code> but when debugging  GDB skip second breakpoint and go directly to third.</p>  <p>What I doing wrong? Thanks for any advice.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>I find answers :) While compilation, if in code is some specific function as strcpy or memcpy, GCC use his own builtin function, not function from headers. It's increase efficiently of programm but in exchange we cannot set breakpoint on it. To bypass this issue, while comipilation, one should add this <code>-fno-builtin</code>. It disable builtin function and give a possibility to set breakpoint on demand line.<br> More info <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options/" rel="nofollow" title="optional title">here</a> :)</p>
