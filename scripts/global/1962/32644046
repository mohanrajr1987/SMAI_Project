<p>If I have an MPI program that I want to debug with gdb while being able to see all of the separate processes' outputs, I can use:</p>  <pre><code>mpirun -n &lt;NP&gt; xterm -hold -e gdb -ex run --args ./program [arg1] [arg2] [...] </code></pre>  <p>which is well and good when I have a GUI to play with. But that is not always the case.</p>  <p>Is there a similar set up I can use with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/" rel="nofollow"><code>screen</code></a> such that each process gets its own  window? This would be useful for debugging in a remote environment since it would allow me to flip between outputs using <code>Ctrl+a n</code>.</p>
