<p>I am using gdb version 6.8 on an ubuntu 9 machine image. I would like to update it to the latest one (7.8?) but I'm not sure how to do it.</p>  <p>I tried following the instructions here <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/529781/upgrade-from-gdb-7-7-to-7-8">http://askubuntu.com/questions/529781/upgrade-from-gdb-7-7-to-7-8</a> but they didn't work. </p>  <p>It stopped at the tar command and said "this does not look a tar file"</p>  <p>Can anyone help?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
