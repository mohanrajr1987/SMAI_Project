<p>I'm trying to make a client remote for a java program, I've read about sockets but there seems to have several protocols and ways of doing that.</p>  <p>Basically I'd just want to be able to push button on the client part of the application and activate related functions on the server part, in local.</p>  <p>I guess I should be listening to a socket in a separate thread and transfer/read strings to know what was pushed? it's mostly for learning purpose.</p>  <p>I'd like some advice/quick explanation to know how to achieve this, I've seen examples of basic client sever communication but I didn;t find anything really clear on how this should be done (new thread or not?) and clearly I seem to not fully understand the concept of inputstream/outputstream. thanks in advance.</p>
