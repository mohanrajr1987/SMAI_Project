<p>I would like to become more knowledgeable in Java and thus want to learn how to go for bigger projects. </p>  <p>I already finished a project that could handle some predefined requests. For example I was able to use get some certain information from a certain website and already post some certain information to a website and to delete some certain entries. However this looks rather specific, concrete not very general. </p>  <p>I want to change this.  I want to generalize now my first success.</p>  <p>For example: I have a GUI and the GUI lets me interact with another website. As an example: My GUI is made so that I can interact with my "Facebook" account.</p>  <p>The ultimate step would be to generalize this to ANY website, for example my GUI interacts with a search engine like google chrome or firefox and goes into the website I want it to go into and let me interact with it.  But I guess then I would have already written myself a new browser. But well, that is the direction I want to head in and arrive maybe after one or three years. </p>  <p>How long it would take me, depends on the resources I can go back to and learn. Therefore I would be really happy, if someone could recommend me study material to do that.  Any advice, comment or answer is appreciated. Thx in advance.     </p>
