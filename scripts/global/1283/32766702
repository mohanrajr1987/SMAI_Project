<p>Obviously if I do not hash the password on the client site, I am transmitting the actual password through the websocket to the server. Although I am using SSL I am still concerned about this.</p>  <p>However because the client has limited computing power, I can see that hashing on the server could in the long term be a better option as I could implement hardware specifically for this and increase the rounds massively. </p>  <p>If I hash on the client I have to also hash in a challenge. I wish there was a way I could has on both the client so the raw password is not sent over the network then more on </p>
