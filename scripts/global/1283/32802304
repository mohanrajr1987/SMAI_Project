<p>I'm trying to learn how to write a client/server application to transfer files to and from a server using SSL.  I've mostly figured out the client side using cURL and/or OpenSSL in C++, but I'm stumped on the server side...  I have experience using Perl and other cgi-bin type scripts but I haven't been able to find any tutorials on how to actually receive the data on the server side, only about the certificates and the authentication. Any help would be most appreciated!</p>
