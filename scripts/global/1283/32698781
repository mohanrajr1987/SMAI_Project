<p>I bought a Netgear Nighthawk 8000.  I am quite impressed with the router. One of the major reasons I bought the router was for VPN services.  While going through the install I was a little upset that it did not support Android.  Finally, I found the answer and used the OpenVPN Client found an article (<a href="http://mrrobwad.blogspot.com/2015/03/connecting-to-netgear-nighthawk-vpn-with-android.html" rel="nofollow">LINK TO ARTICLE</a>) that walks you through how to setup the OpenVPN Client software to work.  I successfully connected my Android phone to the VPN.  I turned off the wifi and used my carrier signal to verify and I was a node on the network.  Everything worked correctly.  Then I connected my tablet and it worked correctly by performing the same test.  I was able to see my servers and reach all the local machines in my network.  At work, when I connect my phone it works as expected and I can see all the machines on my network at home.  However, when I connect my tablet it doesn't see any the local machines.  So I tried logging in to the Router by IPAddress in the browser (Like I normally do).  Instead of giving me a login to my router it is the local router here at work (My router identifies as Nighthawk... etc... the router at work identifies as WRDT-something or other..)  So for some reason I can get my phone to login and become a node on my network but when I use my tablet, it will connect but will not become a node on my network.  I have to believe this is a configuration problem on the tablet, however, EVERYWHERE else I use the VPN the tablet works as expected.  Mildly frustrating...  The only configuration in the article was the route-gateway custom option and I have verified it exists in both the phone and tablet.  Phone is a Samsung Galaxy S5 and tablet is a Samsung Galaxy 4.  Any kind of direction on where to start checking stuff would be greatly appreciated.</p>
