<p>Here's the situation: I need an upload form that uploads a file to an FTP server. The FTP server is not a web server (it's a windows machine in our server room). I have another web server (HostGator) that hosts our website and web apps. </p>  <p>Right now it works if I first upload the file to the web server (using <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload</a> which works very well) then when the upload is complete have PHP send it to the FTP server. Kinda like this:</p>  <pre><code>(ftp server)   &lt;-----------  (web server)                    file    ^                                               / file                          /               (client browser) </code></pre>  <p><strong>But the script times out for large files.</strong> It would be much faster and better if the file could be transferred directly to the ftp server, like so:</p>  <pre><code>(ftp server)            (web server)         ^                                              \ file                          \                        (client browser) </code></pre>  <p>So my first idea was to serve some sort of JavaScript app that is an FTP client that can connect directly to our FTP server. </p>  <p>However, I'm not finding any such thing with a google search. Does anyone know if this is even possible? Is there an app out there? I don't have time to implement my own right now, seems like that would be a large project.</p>  <p>Can you think of any other solution? Could PHP on the web server send the file to the FTP server without first uploading it to the web server?</p>
