<p>I am developing webpage which will ask user to upload images.This uploaded images will be verified at server side by PHP. I am more concerned about how should verify it at client side. Many solutions given on internet talks about checking this by using file extension but this is not good idea to do. If anyone changes extension of file such as "file.exe" to "file.jpeg" then executable file will considered as jpeg. What will be the solution for this sort of scenario?</p>
