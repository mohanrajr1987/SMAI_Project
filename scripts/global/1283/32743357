<p>I am using the org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPSClient for download files from external ftp server. This server is no managed by me and it is configured with option "<em>require_ssl_reuse</em>" enabled. Which means, as I understand, that same session must be used for command and data connection. </p>  <p>For command connection port 21 is used but for data the port is selected from range of not used ports. So when after successful connection to server I try yo list directory the connection is closed due to this restriction.</p>  <p>Internally the java client uses SSLSockets. Is it possible to reuse SSLSession for the same IP but different ports? Do somebody knows the java client which supports ssl session reuse?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
