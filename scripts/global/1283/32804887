<p>I need help about computer networking.</p>  <p>Can a network server monitor/keep track of the devices plugged in to a client computer? Like, track all the devices (flash drive, mouse, keyboard, webcam, printer) plugged and removed on a client computer? A clear and simple explanation will be very much appreciated!</p>
