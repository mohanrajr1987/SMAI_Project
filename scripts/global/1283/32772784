<p>A novice in C#, I am trying to create a client library in C# that would connect to a web api and retrieve appropriate data. My library connects to web api which responds with a JSON output when you do the following:</p>  <pre><code>    public string GetData(string urlPath)     {        HttpResponseMessage response = httpClient.GetAsync(urlPath).Result;        string temp = "";        if(response.IsSuccessStatusCode)        {           temp = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;           return temp;        }        return "";      } </code></pre>  <p>GetData is a part of the library and called by the App. The current code returns a string (originally a JSON file represented as a string). I want to encapsulate this JSON data and return as an object. How do I go about doing that in C#? </p>  <p>I have the model that is used by the server to create the JSON file, I intend to use the same model to create the object from the JSON file.</p>
