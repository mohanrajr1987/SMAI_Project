<p>I'm trying to implement a simple OpenSSL client/server model in C, and curious about the use of the BIO_* calls that allow for some nice features versus the raw SSL_* calls.</p>  <p>I'm relatively new to this, so I could be looking at it completely wrong, but is it possible to use BIO_* calls on the client, and not use it on the server?  Or for a connection to be established, a BIO_* handshake must occur on both client and server?</p>
