<p>I am struggling to set up ServiceStack provided clients for ServiceStack web service as I am not sure what procedure to follow. I am assuming I MUST add 'ServiceStack Reference'? And the web service returns a '500 internal server error' when I put stuff into the window popped up by right click solution -> 'Add ServiceStack Reference'. While it worked when I used the Hello sample generated by ServiceStackVS. Solutions and why references (DTOs) are a must to test out the web service. Thanks.</p>
