<p>I am generating shareable links for a huge number of files using the Dropbox Core API (Python 2.7). For every single file I run:</p>  <pre><code>dropbox_file = dropbox_client.share(item_filename, short_url=False) item_url = dropbox_file[u'url'] </code></pre>  <p>For 1k files for example this takes about 30 minutes. Bandwidth is not the issue - it's the time required for every single request. Is there a way to pass a list of files instead of individual file names - or similar - for speeding this process up?</p>  <p>Reference: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python#DropboxClient.share" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python#DropboxClient.share</a></p>
