<p>I know that it is possible to base class variable holding derived class object. Like below....</p>  <pre><code>class Animal {     public void printName()     {         System.out.println("Print your name");     } }   public class Tiger extend Animal {     public void Print()     {         System.out.println("My Name");     }     public void static main(String args[])     {         Animal type1 = new Tiger();         //with this new created type1 varibale. I can only access members of Animal class.         type1.PrintName() // valid         type1.Print() //In-valid     } } </code></pre>  <p>So what is the usefulness of this? Still I don't see any benefit. Can someone explain me, may be I am missing something. Thanks.</p>
