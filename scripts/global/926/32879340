<p>Say I have a third party's model and it's not marked as abstract. I want to inherit it, add my own fields on top of that, and have it all be a single table in the database. Normally, that means I should inherit from an abstract model class, but I don't have that luxury in this case. Is there a way to have an intermediary step that creates an abstract class from the parent, so I can inherit from that one instead?</p>
