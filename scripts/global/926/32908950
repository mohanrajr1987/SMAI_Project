<p>While playing with JavaScript (which is pretty new for me), I found some strange behaviour:</p>  <pre><code>var some_object = {     foo: "bar",     baz: "moo" };  console.log(some_object); // { foo: 'bar', baz: 'moo' }  var inherited_object = Object.create(some_object); console.log(inherited_object); // {}  console.log(inherited_object.baz); // moo </code></pre>  <p>Inherited object looks 'empty' but its members are still accessible by key. What is going on here and what logic stands behind such behaviour? </p>
