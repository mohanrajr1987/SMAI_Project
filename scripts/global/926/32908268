<p>I want to have a <code>class</code> in which there are two methods - the first takes input from the console, and the second prints the input to the console. Simply as that.</p>  <pre><code>class A(object):     def __init__(self, inp=raw_input('')):         self.inp = inp      def foo(self):         print self.inp </code></pre>  <p>Question, I guess, related with inheritance in Python: why do I get something like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;bound method A.foo of &lt;A object at 0x7f16e762a550&gt;&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What should I change to pass the input to the printing method?</p>
