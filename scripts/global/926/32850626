<p>In Swift if I have a base class and two classes that inherit from it that have their own properties. If I assign a variable to the base class then later change it to the subclass, I can't access said properties. Here is a really dumb example. It's what I could think of in a pinch. <a href="http://swiftstub.com/927736954/?v=gm" rel="nofollow">http://swiftstub.com/927736954/?v=gm</a></p>  <pre><code>class Animal {     let alive = true }  class Human:Animal {     let socks:Int = 5 }  class Dog:Animal {     let collar = "fun" }  var a:Animal!  var letter = "h"  switch letter {     case "d":         a = Dog()     case "h":         a = Human()     default:         a = Animal() }  print(a is Human) // TRUE print(a.socks) // :28:7: error: 'Animal' does not have a member named 'socks' </code></pre>  <p>How can I initially set a variable as a base class and turn it into it's subclass and access properties of said subclass?</p>
