<p>I have a log file with events of the form</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ae cat="fixed" ts="2015-09-11T05:57:27.500-07:00"&gt;  &lt;s u="admin"&gt;&lt;/s&gt; &lt;/ae&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and I want to use the xml logstash filter on this file to parse it and get @cat=fixed</p>  <pre><code>filter {      multiline {          pattern =&gt; '^&lt;ae'          negate =&gt; true          what =&gt; "next"          }       xml {           store_xml =&gt; "false"           source =&gt; "message"           xpath =&gt; [ "/ae/@cat", "cat" ]        }     } </code></pre>  <p>This only gets the first line of the event. I have tried several things with negate 'false' or what 'previous' but nothing seems to work. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
