<p>I'm trying to read values from a single cell (in Column A) and with each value I'm trying to use it as a variable towards an XML path. However, I keep getting an "Object variable or with block variable not set" error after the first cell value is retrieved.</p>  <p>Assume Column A contains '<strong>Last Names</strong>' (Rogers, Manning, Brady, etc.) and I want to populate Column B with the First Name values retrieved from the XML file.</p>  <pre><code>Sub MySub   Dim j As Integer Dim lastrow As Integer Dim FirstNameSearch As Variant Dim FirstName as String Dim LastName As Variant  Dim XMLFile As DOMDocument Set XMLFile = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM") XMLFile.setProperty "SelectionLanguage", "XPath" XMLFile.Load (XCMFileName) 'Load XCM File  lastrow = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count - 2      Set FirstNameSearch = XMLFile.SelectNodes("Home/Database") For j = 0 To lastrow     LastName = Range("A" &amp; j + 2).Value     FirstName = FirstNameSearch(j).SelectSingleNode("Directory[@id='" &amp; LastName &amp; "']/FirstName").Text     Range("B" &amp; j + 2).Value = FirstName      j = j + 1 Next End Sub </code></pre>
