<p>I have an XML file that has many nodes with the same name. I need to reach to a specific node, <em>not by its name nor by its attribute</em>, but by its <strong>order</strong> of appearance in the XML file. For example:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;category field="X"/&gt; &lt;class LN="RF"/&gt; &lt;category field="Y"/&gt; &lt;p name="state"/&gt; &lt;category field="Z"/&gt; &lt;category field="A"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So I need to reach the node <code>&lt;category field="Z"/&gt;</code> for example not because its attribute is <code>="Z"</code> but because its <strong><em>order</em></strong> is the third in the group of <code>category</code> nodes.</p>
