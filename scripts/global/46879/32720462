<p>I'm dynamically generating a document that needs to be validated against a schema at runtime. The problem I'm running into is that the structure of the document is correct, but the sequence of elements at each level is not. Is there a way to tell the transformer to write out the elements in the order specified by an xsd file? or am I going to have to parse the xsd and sort it manually?</p>
