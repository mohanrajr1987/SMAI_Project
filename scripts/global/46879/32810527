<p>1) Check this news output link:<br> www.google.com/search?q=example&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnt&amp;sbd:1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBUQpwVqFQoTCJi2r5XYl8gCFYeNDQodbDQF1g&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=599&amp;dpr=1.1</p>  <p>The parameters used are tbs=sbd:1, &amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnt - This SHOULD give you a time-sorted list of news. The most recent at the top. (Sorted by date as the parameter - sbd:1). However, when you click it, it goes back to sorted by relevance for some reason.  Please check the meaning of URL tags here: <a href="https://stenevang.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/google-search-url-request-parameters/" rel="nofollow">https://stenevang.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/google-search-url-request-parameters/</a></p>  <p>2) Now, check the corresponding RSS link: news.google.com/news/feeds?num=10&amp;q=example&amp;tbs=sbd:1&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnt&amp;output=rss</p>  <p><strong>Search for the title tag (in the above link) in your browser. You will note that the news stories have been REORDERED based on what Google calls "relevance" (even though sbd:1 is specified) . The most recent is NOT at the top.</strong> </p>  <p><strong>Does anyone know why this happens? Is there a way to solve this? I want the most recent news titles at the top of the page on RSS. How to achieve this?!</strong></p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
