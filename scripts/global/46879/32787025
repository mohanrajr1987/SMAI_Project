<p>I am looking to batch convert a large amount of ALTO format XML docs to various formats in Windows, txt at least, rtf if possible and pdf would be convenient as well.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALTO_(XML)" rel="nofollow">ALTO</a> is an xml standard used by libraries and archives to hold metadata/format/font/layout aware text for reconstruction in PDF images.</p>  <p>I have only the XML files for a large archive that I would like to convert for text mining. The software I am using requires clean text or rtf files, so converting the xml to plain text is kind of the goal. Because ALTO is a standard the conversion should be possible, no?</p>  <p>A bonus would be the ability to either embed the metadata in a pdf or convert it to a bibliographical format file like LaTex. This could be a separate program.</p>  <p>I'd appreciate any ideas,</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
