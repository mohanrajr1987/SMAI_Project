<p>I'm trying to parse a file listed with applicable regex, accepting the regex string to a variable and then use it in a expression. But while in doing so I'm facing troubles with \ and could not use them. Below is the block which is using the code. Can you tell me why it is working for ""©?.*"" and not for ""©?\\s*\\w+.*"". The expression is valid otherwise.</p>  <pre><code>String valuePattern = attrs.getNamedItem("valuePattern").getTextContent(); if (newNodeName == "") {     System.out.println(valuePattern);     // System.out.println("Inside Delete node...");     if (valuePattern == ""         || (valuePattern != "" &amp;&amp; node.getTextContent().matches(valuePattern))) {         System.out.println("in match");         System.out.println("Deleting: " + node.getTextContent());         node = null;     } </code></pre>
