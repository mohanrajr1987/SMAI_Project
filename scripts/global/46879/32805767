<p>Recently I have been using XML files for a localisation system for a game I am developing (which uses Cocos2d-X). I am using PugiXML to parse the XML localisation file. I have run into an issue when parsing English strings with newline (<code>\n</code>) characters in them. Put more accurately, in the XML file: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Mqfb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Mqfb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The problem is that PugiXML parses these <code>\n\n</code> characters into <code>\\n\\n</code>. Here's how it looks like on the debugger:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dqBYt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dqBYt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Note that the string the system is trying to translate is</p>  <p><code>englishstring (englishstring   std::__1::string    "(We?[lcom]*e)(to|Regex).+\n\n(tap to continue)")</code></p>  <p>and the string that pugixml is returning is</p>  <p><code>engString(engString    std::__1::string    "(We?[lcom]*e)(to|Regex).+\\n\\n(tap to continue)")</code></p>  <p>Obviously comparing these two strings fails, so nothing gets translated. Plus, Cocos2d-X won't draw a newline with <code>\\n</code> so setting all linebreaks to that isn't an option either. </p>  <p>I understand this is probably desired behaviour, but my question is: how can I fix/disable this behaviour? I have set my XML parsing mode to <code>pugi::parse_minimal</code> but it still returns <code>\\n</code> characters. </p>
