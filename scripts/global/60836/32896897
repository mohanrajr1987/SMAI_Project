<p>I've got a Play server and an Akka server that I'm sending Scala objects between. Currently we are using <a href="https://github.com/romix/akka-kryo-serialization" rel="nofollow">akka-kryo-serialization</a> to serialize the messages. It's working fine, but we need the objects to be version safe, so we can add extra fields as the need arises without breaking things.</p>  <p>Looking at the documentation for akka-kryo it doesn't look like it's version safe. I've also looked at using Protocol Buffers, but we have a lot of deeply nested objects and really don't want to write converters to and from the proto message objects and our own objects. Numerous google searches have also come up empty.</p>  <p>It seems like this has to have been a problem somebody else has had, is there a good solution I'm overlooking?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
