<p>I am trying to understand and use akka persistence. I am new into this EventSourcing world.</p>  <p>I am trying to get an ActorRef to list some items, I am getting this "actor name is not unique" error; so I am trying to use this actorSelection method.</p>  <p>The problem is it asks for a <strong>path</strong>. Which path is that? How can I make sure I am using the correct path if I am using PlayFramework's Akka.system()?</p>  <p><strong>Current code</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>def index = Action {     val queryActor = Akka.system.actorOf(IssuesView.props, IssuesView.actorName)     val inbox = Inbox.create(Akka.system)     inbox.send(queryActor, IssuesView.GetAll)     val issueSet = inbox.receive(1 seconds).asInstanceOf[IssueSet]     Ok(views.html.index(issueSet.issues.toSeq)) } </code></pre>
