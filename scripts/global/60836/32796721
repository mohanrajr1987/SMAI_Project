<p>I notice both <code>views.html.myView.render(...)</code> and <code>views.html.myView(...)</code> can be used to generate a page from the template. However, in case that we need to pass a implicit parameter list into the view, it seems only the <code>apply</code> version works while the <code>render</code> version does not compile.</p>  <p>I assume <code>views.html.myView.apply</code> probably delegates to <code>views.html.myView.render</code> (or the other way around) behind the scene, but I'm not sure and can't find anything related to this in the documentation. The only thing I can get from the Twirl documentation is that <code>TemplateN</code> traits all define the <code>render</code> method, but none of them mention <code>apply</code>.</p>
