<p>I'm using Play 2.3.9 and securesocial 3.0-M3 to build my web app.</p>  <p>I am having an issue when my users are resetting their passwords. Once reset they cannot use the new password to log into the application. </p>  <p>However, when they use a third party access (in my case it's an Outlook plugin) they can use the new password. It looks like a cache issue, but I don't know how to clear the cache when resetting the password.  I don't know if it's related, but I set the cookie idleTimeoutInMinutes=720 and absoluteTimeoutInMinutes=1440 in securesocial.cookie (securesocial.conf)</p>  <p>Do you have any idea what it could be? Thanks a lot for your help</p>
