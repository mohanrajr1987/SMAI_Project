<p>I'm trying to enable Logback in my Playframework application, but it is not quite working at Azure environment, just in my dev's. </p>  <p>I added a file named logger.xml at the /conf folder, just like the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/SettingsLogger" rel="nofollow">site</a> says. But when I create a war and upload it to Azure website, it seems to ignore it.</p>  <p>Any idea how to solve it?</p>  <p>I'm using PlayFramework 2.3</p>
