<p>I am using scala play framework [2.4.2] to build the backend of a Single Page App with Angular. I have all my front end stuff in its own folder and am compiling and minimising the assets with gulp.js.</p>  <p>After every change my front end is recompiling into</p>  <pre><code> /ui/dist/assets </code></pre>  <p>and I have added this to my build.sbt</p>  <pre><code>unmanagedResourceDirectories in Assets += baseDirectory.value / "ui/dist/assets" </code></pre>  <p>Then in my routes I am doing this:</p>  <pre><code>GET         /assets/*file                        controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file) </code></pre>  <p>This works all fine except when I make a change to the files and they are rebuilt play will not find the new files. They will exist in the ui assets directory but I will get a 404 error within my browser. Restarting play will fix it and if play incrementally compiles (which is not done when gulp runs) then things work.</p>  <p>The documentation mentions that the assets get packaged into the application Jar file and it makes sense that it would error until this is rebuilt. However is there a way to force this? the auto incrementer isnt picking up the changes.</p>
