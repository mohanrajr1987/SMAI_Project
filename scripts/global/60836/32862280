<p>I want to know that how can I integrate my Application.scala with my angularjs(app.js) using Play framework. I'm doing some exercise with: <a href="https://github.com/NeelSachdeva/fileUpload" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/NeelSachdeva/fileUpload</a> .   If I run my application(It consists of angularjs and above fileUpload task), it is executing only my Application.scala controller(means my file Upload task only) but not exusting my app.js file(which is having some tabs-angular code). Otherwise is there any chance to execute the above functionality in my app.js tabs(in my html files) I hope I'm missing some integration part for both(Application.scala and it's scala.htmls and app.js) in some where ? Please let me know what I'm missing.</p>
