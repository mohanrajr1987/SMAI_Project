<p>I want to setup a Play Framework application which runs on Java 7. The latest versions of Play Framework does not support Java 7. So by looking at the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/changelog" rel="nofollow">change log</a> I figured out <a href="https://www.playframework.com/download#older-versions" rel="nofollow">2.3.10</a> is the one I want.</p>  <p>Weirdly though, the activator links for every 2.3.x+ version points to the same place. Also downloading and running them would set up Play Framework 2.4.3 without any kind of questions asked.</p>  <p>Below is the my terminal output:</p>  <pre><code>shyam@shyam-work:~/Applications/activator-1.3.6-minimal$ cd shyam@shyam-work:~$ cd Applications shyam@shyam-work:~/Applications$ cd activator-1.3.6-minimal/ shyam@shyam-work:~/Applications/activator-1.3.6-minimal$ ./activator new  Fetching the latest list of templates...

In both case the same results were produced.</p>  <p>Consequently, I tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31069320/unsupportedclassversionerror-on-running-play-application-with-jdk-1-7#comment50158358_31069457">this</a> but that gave rise to a different build fail error altogether.</p>  <pre><code>/home/shyam/Applications/activator-1.3.6-minimal/play-java/build.sbt:17: error: not found: value routesGenerator routesGenerator := InjectedRoutesGenerator ^ [error] Type error in expression </code></pre>  <p>I tried fixing this with another SO post(unfortunately I tried it some time ago and at this point I don't have the patience to go through all this again) which too gave an entirely new error.</p>  <p>So my question is: How hard is it to actually setup a simple Play Framework application to run on Java 7?</p>
