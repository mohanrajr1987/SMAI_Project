<p>I'm trying to create a fresh Java application using Play Framework 2.2.3, I run JDK 1.8.0_60.</p>  <p>Running <code>play new</code> does work and generates the project I want, however when I try to set it to work with Eclipse Luna by typing <code>play eclipse</code> it fails to compile and writes this:</p>  <pre><code>[info] About to create Eclipse project files for your project(s). [info] Compiling 4 Scala sources and 2 Java sources to D:\EclipseTest\FileUpload \target\scala-2.10\classes...

I saw a solution which modified the <code>build.sbt</code>, saying the code parts couldn't find the libraries they depend on. I removed the libraries found in the <code>Seq</code> section, but it was unhelpful.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>Here's my <code>build.sbt</code> file:</p>  <pre><code>name := "FileUpload"  version := "1.0-SNAPSHOT"  libraryDependencies ++= Seq(   javaJdbc,   javaEbean,   cache )       play.Project.playJavaSettings </code></pre>  <p>And my <code>project/plugins.sbt</code>:</p>  <pre><code>// Comment to get more information during initialization logLevel := Level.Warn  // The Typesafe repository resolvers += "Typesafe repository" at "http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/"  // Use the Play sbt plugin for Play projects addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % "2.2.3") </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>  <p>In the log above it says that the <code>play</code> libraries are missing: <code>play.*, play.mvc.* &amp; play.api.templates.Html</code>. How could this be though? I only just created the project. </p>
