<p>Below is my code:</p>  <pre><code>def runAsync(crewType: String) = Action.async {     val temp: Future[Result] = Future(Crew.findCaptainByCrewType(crewType) match {       case None =&gt;         BadRequest(s"Invalid crew name provided: $crewType")       case Some(crew) =&gt;         system.actorSelection(s"/user/${crew.cptName}").resolveOne().map { actorRef =&gt;           Ok(println("hi hi"))         }     })      temp } </code></pre>  <p>I don't understand why this doesn't work?</p>  <p>My objective is to have user pass in a name, which then I try to find an actor with that name using the actorSelection and resolveOne. I assume I am using it incorrectly?!</p>
