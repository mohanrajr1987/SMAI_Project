<p>When clicking on an image (one of the cartoons of <a href="http://www.hobega.nl/nl/humor" rel="nofollow">http://www.hobega.nl/nl/humor</a> which will open the fancybox), the fancybox works correctly on Chrome and Firefox, but Safari puts the fancybox on an incorrect position. Can anyone help with this?</p>  <p>Note; if the page is not working, it might be that I am currently editing. Due to technical issues, it is impossible for me to work offline.</p>
