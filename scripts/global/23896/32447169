<p>I'm using Fancybox 2.1.5 and am testing on an iPhone 4s. When I click an image and the fancybox pops up, it is off-center (partially off-screen to the right), and stretched horizontally so that the image is very distorted. Happens both in portrait and landscape mode. Any ideas? </p>  <p>I do have the images nested a few divs deep, and I'm using this meta tag: meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1,       maximum-scale=1"</p>  <p>Seems to work perfectly on laptop and desktops...</p>
