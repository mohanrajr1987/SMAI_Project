<p>I am trying to get Fancybox to close and jump to a specific section anchor when when link is clicked within the fancybox ajax content. I have been trying several variations on this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a onclick="$.fancybox.close(); href="pricing"&gt;See pricing&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But every time I click the link it returns to the section anchor where it was initiated. Am I missing something really obvious here?</p>
