<p>Currently I am working in this site <a href="http://rentmesh.com/" rel="nofollow">Rentmesh</a></p>  <p>If you click on the match me button on the right top of the site, you can see a Jquery popup box.  But in Mac OS the close button of this pop up is missing the "X" symbol inside it. It is working from all browser in my windows system. Currently I don't have a Mac system to check this.  Can anyone please help me. Thanks.</p>
