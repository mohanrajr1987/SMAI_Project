<p>Is there an example for fancybox 2 that demonstrates usage of thumbnails with next and prev button for the thumbnails and a limit value for the amount of visible thumbnails? By the way, this is not a wordpress implementation but one in custom Website (asp.net mvc).</p>  <p>My requirements are: - Show a Maximum of 4 thumbnails (we have currently up to 12 thumbnails per Gallery) - Show a prev and next button for the thumbnails that works independently from the next and prev Buttons of the Gallery. So, Scrolling through the thumbnails does not scroll the Gallery</p>  <p>Thank you for assistance SkippingAdi</p>
