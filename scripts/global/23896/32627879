<p>I got a weird problem with a clients site, they moved servers without telling me and since then Fancybox doesn't work. </p>  <p>All the code is unchanged and still works locally, but not on the website anymore. I get 404 for the 3 fancybox files although the file path and structure stays the same:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="javascript/source/jquery.fancybox.css" type="text/css" media="screen" /&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascript/source/jquery.fancybox.pack.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Troubleshooting in the browser gives me: www.website.com/javascript/source/jquery.fancybox.pack.js &amp; css 404 not found. I tried it with a / at the start of the href and also with direct http link but all 3 don't work.</p>  <p>Any ideas? Could it be a configuration problem on the server-side?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
