<p>I am using <code>fancybox</code> in e-commerce site to show products in the pop-up box.</p>  <p>I am facing an issue here, when a user clicks on the view button, <code>fancybox</code> starts loading, but suddenly when a user clicks the escape button on the keyboard and <code>fancybox</code> will close.</p>  <p>I have spent lots of time to prevent <code>fancybox</code> closing but didn't succeed.</p>  <p>your ideas are most welcome.</p>
