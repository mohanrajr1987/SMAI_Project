<p>I have 1 grid off-front with huge data and also there is popout option, when user click on popout icon, grid will open in full screen (i'm making use of fancybox for opening huge grid content).</p>  <p>Problem is Huge Data into the grid is not getting refreshed into fancy box. Please check with below code for fancy box.</p>  <pre><code>$(".fullScreen").click(function() {     $.fancybox.open($('#divFullScreenGrid'), {         padding: 0,         width: '1200px',         height: '600px',         autoSize: true,         //Code to Make sure fancybox dont get close when user click outside of the box.          helpers: {             overlay: { closeClick: false }         }     });  }); </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way to refresh or reload content inside fancybox.</p>  <p>Please help.</p>
