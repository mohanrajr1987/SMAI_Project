<p>I have 2 questions:</p>  <p>1) I have a large photo-gallery, and each photo is in the same umbrella category, but the user can also sort by other sub-categories. Is there a way to disable fancyBox on images that are currently hidden on the page?</p>  <p>2) When pulling in photos from a db (i.e. grabbing their src attribute and putting them into  tags), what is the best way to display these images without loading the full res. photo as a thumbnail? I initially fetch the photos via AJAX, push their src into a DB, and grab the src on the frontend.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
