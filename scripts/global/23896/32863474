<p>I am working on a web application in which fancybox plugin is used. But there's a strange problem: </p>  <p>Everything is working fine on localhost (local server) but when I upload the app on live server and test it, the fancybox opens in a small size(100 x 100)px and then if I open the browser's debugger (e.g 'firebug'), it resizes to the desired size like (760 x 600)px. Why does it happen? any solutions?</p>
