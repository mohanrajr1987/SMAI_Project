<p>So, basically, I am playing with Fancy box, and basically, just want a title to remain the same for all images in a gallery that get loaded.  Yes, I can just keep this as title for all images, however, when changing between images, the title fades in and out like the image does.  Basically, I don't want the title fading here, I just want the image fading.  Because the Title is always the same.</p>  <p>Here is a fiddle that shows my current problem here with the Title of a Fancybox image gallery:</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cce18389/3/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/cce18389/3/</a></p>  <p>On all images the title will never change.  As the title depicts the Image Gallery Name (for now it's just filled with dummy content).</p>  <p>I have thought of how to possibly include HTML also within a fancybox 2.1 Gallery of images, however, I can not do this properly either, looking at this link here:  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/svsdx/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/svsdx/</a> which adds content to a div instead, not a photo gallery of images as I would like to do.</p>  <p>Here is the code as I have it now:</p>  <pre><code>$(document).ready(function($) { var galleryTitle = $('#galleryTitleHTML').html();      $('a.photogallery').fancybox({         wrapCSS: 'fancy-gallery',         openEffect: 'fade',         closeEffect: 'fade',         title: galleryTitle,         tpl : {             wrap : '&lt;div class="fancybox-wrap" tabIndex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="fancybox-outer"&gt;&lt;div class="fancybox-inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'         },         helpers : {             overlay: {                 css: {'background': 'rgba(0,0,0,0.8)' }             },             title: {                 type: 'outside',                 position: 'top'             },             thumbs : {                 width: 50,                 height: 50             }         }     });      $('.open-photo-gallery').click(function(e) {         e.preventDefault();         var galleryImagesTotal = $('a.photogallery').length,             eqToLoad = Math.abs(Math.floor(galleryImagesTotal / 2));          $('a.photogallery:eq(' + eqToLoad + ')').click();     }); }); </code></pre>  <p>Basically, I would like to pull in a div from the page and place that content above the images.  Only way I can see doing this is with the Title, but the title fades as the images fade.  Just want to get rid of this fading on the title.</p>  <p>Also, I would like the Gallery Title to fill the entire width of the top area, instead of changing to the width of the proportional image.</p>  <p>Anyway to do this?</p>
