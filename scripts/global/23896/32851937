<p>I'm putting together a small website and using fancybox for image galleries. For some reason, there is a very small blue line (not a border) separating each thumbnail on all pages... it wasn't like this when I initially set it up, so i'm not sure what is causing the problem now.</p>  <p>Have a look here for example: <a href="http://inkylizard.com/ceramics.html" rel="nofollow">http://inkylizard.com/ceramics.html</a></p>  <p>Any ideas? </p>
