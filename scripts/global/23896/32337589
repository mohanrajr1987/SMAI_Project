<p>I working in code where they use fancybox to bring up a form.</p>  <p>It works just as it should at first time, in second time, the background site dispose ( because of the applied theme ), but the Fancybox does not load.</p>  <p>This code is used to initialize the Fancybox.</p>  <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {   $(".fancybox").fancybox({     type: 'ajax',     onCleanup: function() {       var myContent = this.href;       $(myContent).unwrap();       console.log("Element was clean");     }   }); }); </code></pre>  <p>I did add this console.log to check when onCleanup is been called, but it never does.</p>
