<p>I want to play a sound on fancybox-open (beforeShow). </p>  <p><strong>My solution at this point:</strong></p>  <pre><code>beforeShow: function(){         $("body").css({'overflow-y':'hidden'});         var audio = new Audio('other/sounds/error.mp3');         audio.play();     } </code></pre>  <p>But i have remarked that the sound dont get played on mobile devices. </p>  <p>Maybe someone knows an other way to play the sound on html5 standart?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
