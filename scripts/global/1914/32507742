<p>I click on 'Check Microsoft Update for more redistributable components' using the "Visual Studio Installer Projects for Microsoft Visual Studio 2015" Extension, and I am taken to an unhelpful page.</p>  <p>I was expecting to see a nice library of robust and complete boostrapper packages, such as:</p>  <ul> <li>MSXML4.0 with SP2 </li> <li>MSXML6.0 with SP1 </li> <li>SQLServer 2008R2 SMO (with    chaining of Native client, CLR types and XML6)</li> <li>SQLServer Compact 3.5</li> <li>MDAC2.8</li> <li>The api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll etc prerequisits for vc14.0 vcredist_x86,vcredist_x64 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48234" rel="nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48234</a>)</li> </ul>  <p>And much more.</p>  <p>Is there such a place? Maybe a GitHub share of boostrapper packages for everyone?</p>
