<p>I need to clear up space on my VPS. I have installed WinDirStat (awesome program!) to see where do the big MBs lay, and found a bunch of .msi files under</p>  <p><em>C:\ParallelsInstaller\parallels\PANEL-WIN_11.0.9</em> </p>  <p>The two subfolders in it-</p>  <ul> <li>dist-msi-Microsoft-2003-i386</li> <li>thirdparty-msi-Windows-any-x86_64</li> </ul>  <p>contains a bunch files like-</p>  <ul> <li>mysql-server-configurator.msi</li> <li>spamassassin.msi</li> <li>sql2012express-x64.exe</li> </ul>  <p><strong>My question is--</strong></p>  <p>Can I move these <em>msi</em> files to my own PC and delete them from the server, or are they still in constant use by server (obviously I use services like mysql, sql express, which their MSIs are in the folder).</p>  <p>THANK YOU!</p>
