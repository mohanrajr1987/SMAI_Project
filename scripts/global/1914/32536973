<p>How to force folders and files to create on install direction?</p>  <p>I've installed a program with Install shield that create some folders and files. Some of files are going to create after installation (like log.dat , etc). Actually their path is not install path and they will create on setup.exe's path. I've added Everyone permission to [CompanyName] but it's still not working.</p>  <p>Any suggestion?</p>
