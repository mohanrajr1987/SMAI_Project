<p>I have a product that needs to install to multiple drives and directories, some of which can be customized. So I'm looking at how directories are changed at run-time in an InstallShield Basic MSI project. I see that the <code>DestinationFolder</code> and <code>InstallChangeFolder</code> dialogs work together to change the <code>INSTALLDIR</code> directory using a <code>SetTargetPath</code> event on the <code>OK</code> button press of <code>InstallChangeFolder</code>. </p>  <p>What I don't understand is why there is only one parameter to <code>SetTagetPath</code>. The <code>MsiSetTargetPath</code> function takes 2 parameters in addition to the installation handle, so I don't understand why the <code>SetTargetPath</code> event only takes 1. I want to set a specified directory variable to refer to the specified directory. That requires two parameters. How are they getting by with just one parameter?</p>  <p>I have read the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371697(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation on <code>SetTargetPath</code></a> 3 times and it still doesn't make sense.</p>
