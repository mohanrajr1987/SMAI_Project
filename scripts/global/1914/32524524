<p>I've got a legacy Visual Studio solution file from a previous programmer that has a vdproj in it which produces a .msi installer. I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, and in order to use the vdproj, I've installed the extension at <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f1cc3f3e-c300-40a7-8797-c509fb8933b9?SRC=VSIDE" rel="nofollow">this location</a> in order to actually create the msi. It all works just fine in terms of creating a legitimate installer that installs functional software, except for some error with code signing. On Windows 10, the Edge browser states that the signature of the file is corrupt or invalid, and it throws up similar warnings when attempting to install the product. You can skip past the warnings, but we don't want our client(s) to have to deal with that.</p>  <p>The older version of the software (v4.0.106) has no problems. Its MSI file has no Digital Signatures tab, even, so I'm very confused.</p>  <p>The main project is a C++ project (vcxproj) if that matters.</p>  <p>Anyone have any ideas on how to either:</p>  <ul> <li>Fix the code sign issue entirely in Visual Studio</li> <li>Remove the digital signatures step in the MSI creation in Visual Studio so I don't have to deal with this issue at all</li> </ul>  <p>I've got some images up of the issues at the following link: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/aB56A" rel="nofollow">click</a>. Without more rep, I can't post more than 1 link or 1 image.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
