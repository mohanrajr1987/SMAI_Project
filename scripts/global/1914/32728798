<p>I am new to both Wix and WixSharp. I recently learnt Wix and created a basic installer with it. One of the properties I used was 'IniFileSearch' which helped me search a value from an IniFile and use that to find an install location for my files. I am trying to do the same using WixSharp but don't seem to find an equivalent method. The closest thing I could find in WixSharp is the 'AppSearch' class (under WixSharp.CommonTasks).  From Wix I know that 'AppSearch' is a MSI database table where search tasks are stored. 'IniFileSearch' is one of those searches. I am not even sure if the 'AppSearch' class in WixSharp library is directly mapped to the 'AppSearch' MSI database table.  Anyways, my goal is to find the 'IniFileSearch' equivalent method in WixSharp Library. If anybody knows it, an example would be great.</p>  <p>Here is a sample IniFileSearch in Wix markup</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Property Id="MY_PROPERTY"&gt;  &lt;IniFileSearch Id="myIniSearch"                 Name="myConfigFile.ini"                 Section="section1"                 Key="name"                 Type="raw" /&gt; &lt;/Property&gt; </code></pre>
