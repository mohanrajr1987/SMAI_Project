<p>I'm making an msi installer using VC++ which copies a *.jar file into a specified destination. The *.jar file is provided with the msi installer(Duh!). But I need to find the location from which the msi installer is being launched. For example, if I provide the whole setup in a DVD, and the user puts the DVD in the drive, and his\her DVD drive is G:\, I need the installer to know that it is launched from "G:" drive so that it should look within G:\ for the *.jar file. The objective is to make the msi installer launch from anywhere so that the necessary path, from which the support files need to be copied, can be obtained. Currently, the msi installer is being launched from a *.cpp file and I have mentioned the path where the *.jar file is located specifically to the msi installer (in otherwords, hardcoded the path within the c++ program). I need to obtain the path in realtime. I'm a beginner. Could someone please help me?</p>
