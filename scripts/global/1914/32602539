<p>I have an MSI that includes a DLL file that is registered using the following code: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;Fragment&gt;   &lt;ComponentGroup Id="ProductComponents" Directory="INSTALLFOLDER"&gt;     &lt;Component Id="XYZ.dll" Guid="&lt;GUID&gt;"&gt;       &lt;File Id="XYZ.dll" KeyPath="yes" Source="XYZ.dll" SelfRegCost="1" /&gt;     &lt;/Component&gt;   &lt;/ComponentGroup&gt; &lt;/Fragment&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now after installation I manually register a different version of the file (using regsvr32). I rerun the MSI installation and do a repair. The manual DLL isn't overwritten by MSI DLL in the repair action. Is there a work around so I can get the MSI DLL when I do the repair action.</p>
