<p>I have windows 8. </p>  <p>Yesterday I downloaded windows 10. When the downloaded finished it asked me when I wanted to run the installation so I selected today.</p>  <p>The installation started running today and got about 60% of the way through when my laptop battery died (I thought the socket was switched on, turns out it wasn't!).</p>  <p>Is there anyway I can re run the installation without having to re-download windows 10 as I have a limited download allowance? As surely the files must be somewhere on my laptop?</p>
