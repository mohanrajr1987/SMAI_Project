<p>I need clients to download an MSI with lightly-customized code in order to set a unique registry value.  When they install the MSI, I need to know <em>their</em> client ID without them having to type it in.  Specifically because the MSI will be deployed through Group Policy.</p>  <p>During my testing phase, I have hard-coded a registry entry in my Wix installer:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;RegistryValue Type="integer" Name="customer" Value="1" KeyPath="yes"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I considered generating a 'standard' MSI and zipping it up with a text file containing the client ID and having the installer read it and write to the registry--but I'd rather have a single file admins can download from their 'web portal' and install.</p>  <p>I have also considered setting up a Windows server with IIS and using a simple web app developed in Visual Studio to accept a ?client_id=blah parameter, then generate the MSI in the background, and then return it in the HTTP response.  While this seems like a great solution, I'm extremely noobish when it comes to .NET development.</p>  <p>Are there any tools or tips there for generating an MSI on-demand with customizations like this?</p>  <p>Ideally, I'd love a 'free' solution, but I realize there might not be any.  I'm open to solutions that involve paying for a service or buying a package.</p>
