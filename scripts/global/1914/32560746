<p>AppLocker allows to restrict access to windows installer files (<code>.msi</code>) based on publisher, path, and user/group. For example, the default rules restrict access to MSI to members of the Administrators group.</p>  <p>MSI has it's own security mechanism: the configuration step runs as unprivileged user, only when installation starts, privilege elevation is requested.</p>  <p>The problem is now that AppLocker does not allow the unprivileged steps to run, forcing the user to install MSI files with Administrators privilege from the beginning.</p>  <p>Am I missing something? Is there a way to restrict access with AppLocker based on user or group without disabling privilege seperation built into windows installer?</p>
