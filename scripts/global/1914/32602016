<p>I have an MSI installer that registers a DLL. I also want to give the users the option to manually register the same DLL (could be different version). Consider the case where the user first installs the MSI, then manually registers the DLL (using regsvr32). The previous file is overwritten.  When I uninstall my initial MSI, the overwritten DLL is also removed. Is there a way I can prevent that from happening in case the first DLL has been overwritten.</p>
