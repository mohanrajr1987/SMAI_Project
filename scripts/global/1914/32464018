<p>I need to have the installer create a directory in the CommonApplicationData directory and have that directory have elevated permission or at least have all sub-directories have read and write permission. In the directory permissions dialog in Indigo Rose MsiFactory I have to select a user or group to apply the permissions to and currently I was using the 'Users' group. However, on Windows installs with culture set to non-English, the 'Users' group does not exists. At least on our test case computer with culture set to es-MX. We recently discovered that the 'Users' group--and every other group--has a code and we are curious as to if we can select to code rather than selecting 'Users' in the file permissions dialog. An example code is: SID: S-1-1-0. These security identifiers can be found from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/243330" rel="nofollow">Security Identifiers</a> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>My question is, is there a group or user that will exists for everyone on the computer of which I may apply special directory permissions to for a directory created by the installer using Indigo Rose MsiFactory?</p> </blockquote>  <p>Please, any ideas will be greatly appreciated.</p>
