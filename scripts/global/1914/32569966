<p>Is it possible to install an MMC snap-in developed with .NET in such a way that multiple versions/instances of the same snap-in are installed on the same system? I'm looking for something like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973913.aspx" rel="nofollow">Registration-Free Activation of COM Components</a> that could be applied to MMC snap-ins somehow since I would like each instance of our product to be truly side-by-side with the other instances.</p>  <p>Alternatively, what is the recommended approach to dealing with side-by-side installations (multi-instance installations) that include MMC snap-ins?</p>
