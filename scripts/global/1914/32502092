<p><em>Disclaimer: I'm fairly new to burn...</em></p>  <p>The .exe files created by WiX Burn bundles are some type of self extracting zip archives, however they seem fairly opaque in structure and I cant find any documentation on them.  For example in 7zip a Burn .exe looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UTOuF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UTOuF.png" alt="burn screenshot"></a></p>  <p>Whereas a traditional .vdproj bundle (and other bootstrappers I have seen) include the bundled files verbatum in a traditional file system.</p>  <p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Is the output format documented anywhere?</li> <li>Is there any way to recover the contents without installing? <strong>EDIT</strong> it seems dark.exe can do this, so <em>2a. is there anything outside the WiX toolkit...</em></li> <li>Is there any way to change the output format?</li> </ol>  <p>Thank you. </p>  <p><strong>NB</strong> <em>The reason I ask is that there are many circumstances (corporate IT departments say) where people extract the .msi files out of traditional bootstrappers to wrap into their own logic / examine the bootstrapper contents as part of an approval process.</em></p>
