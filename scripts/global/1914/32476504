<p>I have a setup project in Visual Studio it has more than 5 pages. From a specific page I two radio buttons where users carefully choose one. In current case most users select the default one. But what I need is there is no radio button is selected and the next button also disabled. On selection of correct radio option only the next button should be enabled. How can I do it only from Visual studio? (without going to WIX or Orca) </p>
