<p>I am trying to install an application (using the SYSTEM account) that installs some certificates in the ProgramData folder by creating a new folder inside it. The installation fails at the stage where it tries to install these certificates. </p>  <p>During the certificate installation process, all it does is create a folder inside ProgramData and write files into it.</p>  <p>I have given FULL CONTROL permission to the SYSTEM user on the ProgramData folder and passed it to subfolders as well.</p>  <p>I have tried executing the .exe file using PSexec tool (this enables using the SYSTEM account). I had opened the PSexec tool from a command prompt that I started using Run as Administrator.</p>  <p>I have also tried extracting the .msi file and run it using TaskScheduler with Elevated Privileges.</p>  <p>I have also manually created the Folders that should be created during installation(in case they do not exist) and given FULL CONTROL permission to the SYSTEM user. I created the Folders using Administrator account and using SYSTEM account. Installation still did not succeed.</p>  <p>The application is a 32-bit application. So, I tried installing it in a 32-bit Windows. It still failed.</p>  <p>I believe the root cause is that permissions to create folders/files in the ProgramData Folder are not there for the SYSTEM account.</p>  <p>Is there something that I am missing here?</p>
