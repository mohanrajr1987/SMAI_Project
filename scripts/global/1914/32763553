<p>My question is pretty simple.</p>  <p>I am using visual studio 2013, I have developed a application the will be having a bunch of dll's and a .exe file.</p>  <p>I have added the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9abe329c-9bba-44a1-be59-0fbf6151054d" rel="nofollow">Setup and package Extension</a> with my vs2013 and it worked fine for me to bundle the files into .msi and a .exe file.</p>  <p><strong>My question:</strong> I know that the .msi file alone is enough to install the app. Is it possible to have a single .exe file?  I want a single .exe file and will start the installation once the .exe file double clicked.</p>  <p>I am seeing lot of application working like the way I said with single .exe file. I am wondering that I unable to find the answer for my question in web.</p>
