<p>I have an application written in python and freezed using py2exe and bundled as an msi using wix. what I am trying to achieve is providing a way to uninstall the application directly from the application. To do that I am running the following command as a subprocess inside python </p>  <pre><code>command = "MsiExec /x{product-code of the application} /qn" process = subprocess.Popen(command,shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE) out = process.communicate() </code></pre>  <p>my question is will the above code snippet uninstalls application even it is running, secondly if I trigger the uninstallation and close the main application will the uninstallation continue ? or the child process dies with parent ?</p>
