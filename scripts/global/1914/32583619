<p>I'm using Visual Studio to make an msi that installs a particular file into the location where JRE is installed. I cannot provide the default path (C:\Program files\Java) since the path could be relative as the user could install JRE in any drive other than C:. How do I do this? Is there a way in which I can locate the JRE path from registry and use this path as the location for installation?</p>
