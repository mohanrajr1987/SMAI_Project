<p>I am using webview in one of OS X app and got strange requirement from client that:</p>  <p>1) Need to show address bar in app for webview, I tried if there's any support by webview but couldn't really find. I know I can do that by having a text field and show URL in that but I am not sure if that's the right way so is there any other better way, please suggest.</p>  <p>2) Need to also check whether loaded URL has SSL support and show some icon like padlock (open/close). So again is there any support or feature of Webview that i can use or I just have to check for URL prefix of http or https? Please help. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. MP</p>
