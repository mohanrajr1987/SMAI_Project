<p>I'm creating an application where I have to display a number of WebViews in a scrollview. </p>  <p>What I have to display is simple html like lists, bold texts, italic texts, checkboxes.</p>  <p>The standed WebView is pretty inefficiant here.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a much simpler and light component capable of displaying simple HTML. Is there a library to do this.</p>  <p>(I have considered TextView + Spannable/ed things, but it doesn't provide checkboxes)</p>
