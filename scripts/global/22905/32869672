<p>I'm using a WebView to browse Facebook. I'd like to get the currently playing video url that contains its id. I know it is possible to get the video url when I press "comment," but I want to get it when I just run the video. Now, the url doesn't change in the webview before or after playing a video, unless pressing "comment." I'm using webview.getUrl() method.</p>  <p>Any help or suggestions are appreciated. </p>  <p>Thank you</p>
