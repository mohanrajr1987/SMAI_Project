<p>I have done lots of research, yet I am stilling having the same problem. I am trying to load a website onto a web view in swift, although every time I run the project, it is giving me the following error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP,subcode=0x0)</p> </blockquote>  <p>The following two lines of code are what I am attempting to use to load the url onto the web view. I want to let you know that these 2 lines of code came from the following video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcVv1N1hReQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcVv1N1hReQ</a>. Here are the lines of code:</p>  <pre><code>var URL = NSURL(string: "https://www.google.com") petInfo.loadRequest(NSURLRequest(URL: URL!)) </code></pre>  <p>In case you are wondering what the outlet for petInfo looks like, it is displayed in the following block of code:</p>  <pre><code>@IBOutlet weak var petInfo: UIWebView! </code></pre>  <p>The outlet is getting initialized immediately before the viewDidLoad() function. The url is being loaded inside the viewDidLoad() function. Thank you in advance for any help.</p>
