<p>I'm working on an app that is basically a web app wrapped inside an Android WebView. I'm using the following code to save the state of the WebView when the user switches to a a different application on their device:</p>  <pre><code>protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);     setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);     mProgressDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);     view = (WebView) this.findViewById(R.id.webView);     ...      view.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);     if (savedInstanceState != null) {         view.setWebViewClient(new HelloWebViewClient());         view.restoreState(savedInstanceState);     }     else{         view.setWebViewClient(new HelloWebViewClient());         view.loadUrl("http://google.com");      } } </code></pre>  <p>Right after I install the app on my device (Samsung Galaxy S4) the state is only saved if I go back to the app by holding down the menu button and selecting it from the recent apps. If, however, I click on the app from the Apps menu, it still restarts. Weirdly, if I restart my device, the WebView state is saved properly, no matter how I go back to the app. Any attempts to explain this behavior are greatly appreciated. It would be great if I could save WebView's state without a restart. </p>
