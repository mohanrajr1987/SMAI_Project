<p>I have a Terms and Conditions page which uses a WebView to display the Terms which are in Html. It is loaded like this -</p>  <pre><code>    WebView webView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webView);     webView.getSettings().setBuiltInZoomControls(true);     webView.getSettings().setSupportZoom(true);     webView.getSettings().setUseWideViewPort(true);     webView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/TermsAndConditions.html"); </code></pre>  <p>Also in my assets folder is the MaintermsandConditions.pdf which is called from a link in the Html like this</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="file:///android_asset/MainTermsandConditions.pdf"&gt;Main Terms&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The only problem is that even though the Pdf is in my assets folder, nothing happens when I click the link. I've tried adding target="_blank" but it still won't work.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong</p>
