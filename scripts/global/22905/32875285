<p>I'm trying to add more empty space to a loaded WebView using JavaScript.</p>  <p>I load data using loadDataWithBaseUrl from a String resource.  Then, after measuring some content, I need to make WebView bigger, say for 100 pixels. So I call javascript function using loadDataWithBaseUrl:</p>  <pre><code>mWebView.loadUrl("javascript:addHeight()"); </code></pre>  <p>Javascript function is defined in the original HTML:</p>  <pre><code>function addHeight() { " +     var elemDiv = document.createElement('div');     elemDiv.style.cssText = 'height:100px;';      document.body.appendChild(elemDiv);  }  </code></pre>  <p>After this, WebView resizes itself to fit the new content. However, resulting height is not originalSize + 100px, but bigger. I don't know where's the problem. I can't determine the target size, because it depends on the size of the appended div and it will be always different.</p>  <p>Has anybody tried this? Are you familiar with this behavior?</p>
