<p>I've written a Java desktop application which includes a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/web/WebView.html" rel="nofollow">JavaFX WebView</a> that must run JavaScript which sends and receives http requests using d3.js to a server (implemented with Jersey) which provides JSON data for the client-side script to consume.</p>  <p>On Mac this works perfectly. However, when running the application on my Windows 8 VM the responses from the server are either not being received or not being processed properly.</p>  <p>I verified that the server is receiving requests when the app is running on both Mac and Windows by adding a log statement to the server-side REST endpoint which prints out a message when the service is invoked and executing the d3 command which submits the request for JSON data in my WebView using the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a> developer console.</p>  <p>The client-side JavaScript I'm using to trigger the behavior is:</p>  <pre><code>d3.json("http://hostname/path/to/rest/endpoint", function (error, data) { console.log(data);}); </code></pre>  <p>On Mac this yields the desired result but on Windows I see no response in the FireBug console.</p>  <p>I've reproduced the behavior using ajax directly as well so I know it's not a problem with d3.</p>  <p>Any help or suggestions on how to debug further would be greatly appreciated!</p>
