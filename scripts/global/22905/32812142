<p>I'm having troubles showing the mobile versions of pages in my webview. I know I can set the UserAgent string to ensure the mobile version is requested (as answered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10834478/webview-not-being-seen-as-a-mobile-browser">here</a>), but I'm not sure how to do this in a way that will work properly - always. Google gives an example of a UserAgentString for Webview in Lollipop <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/user-agent" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>  <pre><code>(Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; Nexus 5 Build/LMY48B; wv) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/43.0.2357.65 Mobile Safari/537.36) </code></pre>  <p>What will happen if I set the UA to be the above on a device that is not Lollipop but older? (Or e.g., with older versions of AppleWebkit?) </p>  <p>Is there a flexible/generic way to ensure the page will always load correctly in mobile version? Thanks!</p>
