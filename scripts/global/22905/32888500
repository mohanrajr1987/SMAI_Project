<p>I'm working on a book reader iOS application and using webview for displaying epub books. The 3rd party library I'm using for parsing epub book is "KFEpubKit".</p>  <p>I've to give option to user to adjust the font size (as in iBooks), and I've achieved that feature by updating the font of webview as:</p>  <pre><code>let textSizeRule = "document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].style.webkitTextSizeAdjust= '\(fontPercentage)%'" self.webView.stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString(textSizeRule) </code></pre>  <p>The problem I'm facing is that by increasing/decreasing font size, page number of book must also change. But I'm unable to do so. </p>  <p>How can I achieve this functionality in the way other book reading applications are doing it (i.e. kindle, iBook etc)?</p>
