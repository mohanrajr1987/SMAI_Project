<p>I have used MysqlDataReader to read data from mysql database however, whenever i coded it in different ways it still reads data incorrectly.  This program is  scheduling system, i used datetimepicker for time and date input, then the user will click the button CHECK to check if it has already exist in the database/not available schedule else it will tell the user that the schedule is available</p>  <pre><code>Dim reader1, reader2 As MySqlDataReader  MySqlConn.Open()  Dim query2, query1 As String  Dim cmd2 As New MySqlCommand      'TIME     query1 = "SELECT * FROM schedule WHERE Date ='" &amp; dtpDate.Text &amp; "'"     cmd = New MySqlCommand(query1, MySqlConn)     reader1 = cmd.ExecuteReader     reader1.Close()      query2 = "SELECT * FROM schedule WHERE Time ='" &amp; dtpTime.Text &amp; "'"     cmd2 = New MySqlCommand(query2, MySqlConn)     reader2 = cmd2.ExecuteReader       If reader1.HasRows And reader2.HasRows Then         MsgBox("A Patient already set an appointment for this schedule! Please set another Time &amp; Date.", MsgBoxStyle.Critical, "Schedule exists")         dtpTime.Select()      ElseIf reader1.HasRows = 0 And reader2.HasRows = 0 Then         MsgBox("Schedule is available!", MsgBoxStyle.Information, "Schedule")      ElseIf reader1.HasRows = 0 And reader2.HasRows Then         MsgBox("Schedule is available!", MsgBoxStyle.Information, "Schedule")      ElseIf reader1.HasRows And reader2.HasRows = 0 Then         MsgBox("Schedule is available!", MsgBoxStyle.Information, "Schedule")     End If      MySqlConn.Close()  End Sub </code></pre>
