<p>I am converting a vb website app to C# and some of the conversions are producing weird results for example</p>  <pre><code>Dim holidayfilepath = HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/Content/USA_Holidays.txt") Dim sList As New List(Of Date) sList = GetHolidays(holidayfilepath) Dim s As String = sList.Aggregate("", Function(current, dDate) current &amp; dDate.ToString()) </code></pre>  <p>returns the filepath variable as        </p>  <pre><code>"X:\Folder\Toolkit\Toolkit\Content\USA_Holidays.txt" </code></pre>  <p>and the code snippet works as expected, producing a list of dates as strings.</p>  <p>But the C# version</p>  <pre><code> public ActionResult Index()     {         var holidayfilepath = HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/Content/USA_Holidays.txt");                     var sList = new List&lt;DateTime&gt;();         sList = DayCalcs.GetHolidays(holidayfilepath);         var s = sList.Aggregate("", (current, dDate) =&gt; current + dDate.ToString(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture));          return View(s);     } </code></pre>  <p>returns the holidayfilepath variable as </p>  <pre><code>"X:\\Folder\\Toolkit\\Toolkit\\Content\\USA_Holidays.txt" </code></pre>  <p>which produces an exception.</p>  <p>Is there a reason the same code line produces a different result in C#? Why does the C# version insert double backslashes which is causing the error?</p>  <p>It produces a TypeInitializationException InnerException </p>  <pre><code>{"Could not find a part of the path 'X:\\Folder\\Toolkit\\Toolkit\\DataFiles\\Holidays.txt'."} </code></pre>  <p>Isn't that what the variable call is supposed to do? get the correct file path, Its finding some folder DataFiles? Since the error is occurring when calling GetHolidays, here is that code snippett</p>  <pre><code> public static List&lt;DateTime&gt; GetHolidays(string holidaysFile)     {         var sAllDates = File.ReadAllLines(holidaysFile);         return sAllDates.Select(Convert.ToDateTime).ToList();     } </code></pre>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>Well the exception said it was looking for DataFiles/Holidays.txt, absolutely zero clue why, but I changed the folder and filename and now it works. Incredibly strange. That text file and folder, with their original names were created in this solution using the add new item dropdown so where that exception is coming from is beyond my understanding.</p>
