<p>I have this code that was given to me a while ago: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24706470/storing-wav-files-in-a-variable">Storing .WAV files in a Variable</a></p>  <p>And it works great, but I'm wondering if there is a simple way to boost the volume in overall for my application.</p>  <p>Windows reports the volume is 100%, but the sound spikes are super tiny, and the sound clips are super low in volume (Compared to other things I have playing I.E Music/Movie etc)</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
