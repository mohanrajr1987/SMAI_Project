<p>I tried to recreate a small thing I tried ages ago. It's literally just a simple paint program. The code is basically:</p>  <pre><code>    Public Sub Form1_MouseDown(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles Me.MouseDown     X = Control.MousePosition.X     Y = Control.MousePosition.Y     Mdown = True End Sub  Private Sub Form1_MouseMove(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles Me.MouseMove     Dim g As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics     Dim NX As Integer = Control.MousePosition.X     Dim NY As Integer = Control.MousePosition.Y     If Mdown = True Then         g.DrawLine(System.Drawing.Pens.Red, X, Y, NX, NY)         X = NX         Y = NY     End If  End Sub  Private Sub Form1_MouseUp(sender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs) Handles Me.MouseUp     Mdown = False End Sub </code></pre>  <p>It works fine, the line draws from the main point to the next as the mouse moves. However, the accuracy of the drawn line is questionable. When drawing in the regular window size (586, 634) on my second monitor (Running at 1280x720) the line very closely follows the mouse tip (but isn't exact). But when the window is on my main (1920x1080) screen, the line is WAY off. Is there a specific reason for this, because I thought calling Control.MousePosition.X/Y got the mouse's position in relation to the window's size not the screen size? (Or something else)</p>  <p>I'm usually able to figure these things out on my own, but this just seems wrong in general. Any ideas?</p>
