<p>I am new to VB 2010 and crystal reports, I have been trying to resolve this issue (public member datadefinition on type string not found) for couple weeks without avail.</p>  <p>I have search everywhere but the answers I have been getting do not solve the problem.  Please see code below:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub SetParamValue(ByVal key As String, ByVal value As String)     Try         Dim crPDV As ParameterDiscreteValue         Dim crPFD As ParameterFieldDefinitions         Dim crPFL As ParameterFieldDefinition         Dim crPV As ParameterValues          crPFD = CrystalReportViewer1.ReportSource.DataDefinition.ParameterFields          crPFL = crPFD.Item(key)         crPV = crPFL.CurrentValues         crPDV = New ParameterDiscreteValue         crPDV.Value = value         crPV.Add(crPDV)         crPFL.ApplyCurrentValues(crPV)     Catch ex As Exception     End Try End Sub  Private Sub LoadHeaderInfo()     Try          SetParamValue("XXXXXXX", mReportNo)         SetParamValue("XXXXXXXX", gInput.Customer)     End Try  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>The array has 80 different values, the *.rpt file loads correctly, but while debugging i get the exception public member datadefinition on type string not found. Once the *.rpt file loads I have to input the data manually.</p>  <p>This question probable has been asked before, but like I mention I have searched and have not been able to solve the issue.  Can someone point me in the correct direction on how to solve this issue?</p>
