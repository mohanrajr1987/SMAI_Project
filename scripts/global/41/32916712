<p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>Dim htmlFile = "\\folder\test.htm" If File.Exists(htmlFile) Then     File.Delete(htmlFile) End If Using strWriter As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(htmlFile, False)     strWriter.Write("content") End Using </code></pre>  <p>It works most of the time but occasionally I'll get an exception of "Access to the path '\folder\test.htm' is denied." The exception occurs on this line:</p>  <pre><code>Using strWriter As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(fileName, False) </code></pre>  <p>How can I ensure that it always creates a new file and never causes an exception?</p>
