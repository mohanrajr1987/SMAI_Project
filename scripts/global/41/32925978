<p>So I am working on a tax calculator as an assignment on my visual basics class, I have had 2 ideas for this to work and i cant figure either of them out.</p>  <p>A. I declared TaxRate as a double and the user would open form2 to set the rate, but how can I use a double from FORM1 on FORM2 and save it?</p>  <p>B. I could have the double equal to form2.textbox1.text but then I how I limit the textbox to 1 Dot and Numbers, DOts, and Backspace only? </p>  <p>My current code is:</p>  <pre><code>Dim allowedChars As String = "0123456789"     If allowedChars.IndexOf(e.KeyChar) = -1 Then         e.Handled = True     End If </code></pre>  <p>and I cant use backspace or dots (I found this sample online.)</p>
