<p>I need the user to type only integer numbers in a TextBox. I already have that validation working, the problem is that I want to show a MessageBox to the user if he/she type a point, a letter, or the symbols !@#. The MessageBox is shown to the user if an invalid character is typed but the letter still appears in the TextBox, which I don't want.</p>  <p>Could you please help me and tell me what's wrong with my code please</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub txtCMS_KeyPress(sender As Object, e As KeyPressEventArgs) Handles txtCMS.KeyPress     If (e.Handled = Not IsNumeric(e.KeyChar) And Not Char.IsControl(e.KeyChar)) = False Then         MessageBox.Show("Favor ingrese solo numeros", "Pablo Tobar says...", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information)     End If        End Sub </code></pre>
