<p>The program used to do fine. Then I upgrade to Windows 10 and now I have these 2 error when running the program in Visual Studio.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning 1 : Cannot find wrapper assembly for type library "Microsoft.mshtml". Verify that (1) the COM component is registered correctly and (2) your target platform is the same as the bitness of the COM component. For example, if the COM component is 32-bit, your target platform must not be 64-bit.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Â </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 2 : Unable to open module file "C:\Users\jim2\AppData\Local\Temp.NETFramework,Version=v4.0.AssemblyAttributes.vb" : The system cannot find the file specified.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Basically, my code builds fine when I was in windows 7. I upgraded to windows 10 and then I got this error.</p>  <p>I've checked <code>C:\Users\jim2\AppData\Local\Temp\</code> folder.</p>  <p>There is no file <code>.NETFramework,Version=v4.0.AssemblyAttributes.vb</code>. I don't know how it happened in Windows 7. In Windows 7, before I upgraded, the program compiled just fine.</p>  <p>It seems that this issue is about files that are not there, but searched by project. After deleting it from project the files got created. Now, I still have the same problem.</p>
