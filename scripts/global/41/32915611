<p>I am just learning visual basic and have been trying to write a code to solve quadratic equations with complex number as roots. Any pointer in the right direction would be appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>Public Class Form1     Dim a, b, c As Integer     Dim x1, x2 As Double      Private Sub Label4_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Label4.Click      End Sub      Private Sub TextBox4_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles eqnRT1.TextChanged      End Sub      Private Sub Button3_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnExit.Click         Close()     End Sub      Private Sub btnClear_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnClear.Click         txtA.Text = ""         txtB.Text = ""         txtC.Text = ""         eqnRT1.Text = ""         eqnRT2.Text = ""     End Sub      Private Sub btnCalc_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCalc.Click         Dim a,b,c as integer         a = txtA.Text          b = txtB.Text          c = txtC.Text           Dim x1 = (-b + math.Sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)         Dim x2 = (-b - math.Sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)         eqnRT1.Text = Str(x1)         eqnRT2.Text = Str(x2)     End Sub      Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load      End Sub End Class </code></pre>
