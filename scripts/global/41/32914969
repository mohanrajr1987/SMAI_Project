<p>I've just completed an APP in VB.NET and I do have a RichtextBox where I show some information to the user, one requirement was to have the option to print only the info that the richtextbox displays and I don't have to use Crystal Reports nor SSRS, so an option for me was to use the ReportViewer but as far as I know it needs a Dataset in order to disply the info in the report.</p>  <p>My question is: how can I do in order to use the ReportViewer just to show some lines of text(the lines of text of my richtextbox)...I know the question is quite cofusing but is a requirement and I don't have any clue.</p>
