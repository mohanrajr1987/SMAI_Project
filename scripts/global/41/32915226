<p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click     Dim randVal As Integer     Dim label As String     Dim val As Integer     Dim stringVal As String     For i As Integer = 1 To 256 Step 1         val = i         stringVal = CStr(val)         label = "Label" + stringVal         randVal = CInt(Math.Floor((20 - 1 + 1) * Rnd())) + 1         label.BackColor = Color.Green     Next  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I get an error that string has no property BackColor.</p>  <p>How would I be able to edit all the strings without calling them individually?</p>
