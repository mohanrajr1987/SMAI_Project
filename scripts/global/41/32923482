<p>I'm new to vb.net. And I need to send sms via VB.net but my problem is I don't have a Broadband stick like this video shows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLP4m6lALvU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLP4m6lALvU</a></p>  <p>So my question is can I connect a pocket wifi to VB.net? If so can someone tell me the code on how to connect it to pocket wifi?</p>
