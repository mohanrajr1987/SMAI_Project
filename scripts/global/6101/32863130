<p>i am generating a restful java jax-rs api with swagger-codgen-cli.jar.<br> Right now i call java -jar with some command line options to do this.</p>  <pre><code>java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i api.yaml -l jaxrs -o ./outputdir </code></pre>  <p>Which works fine.  </p>  <p>But i would like to make this call from of a java program i.e. including the codegen.jar into my classpath and then call the corresponding method with similar parameters.</p>  <p>So is there a public API from the swagger-codegen module which i can call?</p>
