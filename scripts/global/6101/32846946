<p>More details can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32727449/resteasy-host-header-being-overridden">in this post</a>, but the problem is that I'm trying to modify the request headers before they are sent to the server.</p>  <p>Multiple <code>host</code> headers are being sent, and the problem is that the last one is being accepted -- even though it is incorrect.  I tried implementing a <code>ClientExecutionInterceptor</code> thinking that I could get in front of the request before it is sent to the server, but the problem is that the interceptor is never being executed.</p>  <p>Here is my interceptor:</p>  <pre><code>@Provider @ClientInterceptor @Precedence("HEADER_DECORATOR") public class RequestInterceptor implements ClientExecutionInterceptor {    ClientExecutionContext context;    @Override   public ClientResponse&lt;?&gt; execute(ClientExecutionContext context) throws Exception {     this.context = context;     return context.proceed();   } } </code></pre>  <p>And in the <code>web.xml</code> we are scanning for all <code>@Provider</code> classes:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;context-param&gt;   &lt;param-name&gt;resteasy.scan&lt;/param-name&gt;   &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/context-param&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In the logs, I can see the interceptor being registered, but when I execute one of our REST requests, the above class is never hit.</p>  <p>Any thoughts? Thanks.</p>
