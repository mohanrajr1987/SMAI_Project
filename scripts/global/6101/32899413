<p>I am trying to understand the MIME types in RESTful services.If there is a resource method (sayHello) as in below</p>  <pre><code>@Path("/customers") public class CustomerResource {     @GET     public String sayHello(){         return "Hello World";     } } </code></pre>  <p>I didn't put any <code>@Produces</code> or <code>@Consumes</code> annotation on the above method. I have below questions.</p>  <ol> <li>Is there any default MIME type above method uses to send the response ?</li> <li>Or Does it produce response content type based on "accept-type" from  incoming request ?</li> <li>Can it happen that request does not specify what content type does it accept ? If that is the case, what response content type does above resource method will produce  ?</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
