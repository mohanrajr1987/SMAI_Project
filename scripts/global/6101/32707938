<p>I have a custom authenticator (ie. a class that extends Authenticator and does some custom authentication in authenticate(Response res, Request req)) that I then want to pass a value to the function that handles the actual API call. I thought adding an argument like <code>@Context Request request</code> could work but I don't think so.</p>  <p>Anyone know how I can pass an object from Authenticator to resource?</p>  <p>Thanks, Daniel</p>
