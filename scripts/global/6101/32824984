<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There are similar questions to this, but nothing that makes this an <em>exact</em> dupe.</p>  <hr>  <p>I currently have the following Gradle dependencies:</p>  <pre><code>dependencies {     compile "com.sun.jersey.contribs:jersey-apache-client4:1.18.1"     compile "com.sun.jersey:jersey-client:1.18.1"     compile "com.sun.jersey:jersey-core:1.18.1"     compile "com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs:jackson-jaxrs-json-provider:2.3.2"     compile "org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.3.2"     compile "org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j:1.7.7" } </code></pre>  <p>I want to upgrade these to the <code>2.21</code> versions of Jersey, however:</p>  <ul> <li>It seems that the groupName is now <code>org.glassfish.jersey.core</code> instead of <code>com.sun.jersey</code>; and</li> <li>It seems that Jersey-Client now obviates the need to explicitly declare Jersey-Core (Jersey-Core doesn't seem to exist anymore as a JAR)</li> <li>The Jersey Apache 4 Client (<code>jersey-apache-client4</code>) doesn't seem to exist in 2.x land</li> </ul>  <p>So I ask, what should all of my <code>2.21</code> dependencies be? Where's that Jersey/Apache client hiding out these days?</p>
