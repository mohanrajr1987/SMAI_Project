<p>I'm building a system where each user has a lot of information which is changing with very frequency.</p>  <p>I'm trying to build a query system tool over REST (JAX-RS). The main goal I want to achieve is to get only the new information generated.</p>  <p>For example, imagine a REST method <code>getLogs</code> which retrives the logs generated:</p>  <ul> <li>+getLogs() -> List of Logs</li> </ul>  <p>Example:</p>  <ul> <li>1:00 a.m. -> [log1, log2, log3, log4]</li> <li>1:30 a.m. -> user.getLogs() : [log1..4]</li> <li>2.00 a.m. -> [log1, log2, log3, log4, log5, log6]</li> <li>2:30 a.m. -> user.getLogs() : [log5..6]</li> </ul>  <p>Is there some standard way to achieve that?</p>
