<p>I am developing REST webService , and some of my client will use my webservices , so for identify the genuine client , I have decided to give them a unique Application Token to each genuine client . The client will encode this Token and they will put this Token in Request header and I have configure a REST filter in my REST webservices to verify Token . I dont want to use https . My problem is that any one can take that Token from my client site and can consume my REST webservices . How I can stop this ?</p>
