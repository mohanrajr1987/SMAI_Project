<p>Ok, So i've genetrated my java classes from my xsd file using jaxb. I've also written the following code as an endpoint which recieves a request (XML). Now I'd like to read the request into my java objects I can then use these to insert into my DB. Is this the correct way i should be implementing this? If so, how is it done? Thanks   </p>  <pre><code>@POST @Consumes("application/xml") @Produces("application/xml") public String registerPost(@Context HttpServletRequest req) {      try {         //update DB     } catch (DatabaseException e) {         return "Fail";     }  } </code></pre>
