<p>I consider how to design my RESTful web service in JAX-RS and I have encounter some problem.  I have Provider that has ServicePoints and more over ServicePoint entity has composite key consisting of provider_id and service_point_no. So logical seems to have: </p>  <pre><code>/providers/1/service-points/3  </code></pre>  <p>But I would also have the ability to retrieve service points independently of Provider to get all Service Points in given location for instance. </p>  <pre><code>/service-points // all  /service-points?location=CountryName  </code></pre>  <p>But in the first approach I will have:</p>  <pre><code>@Path("/")  class ServicePointResource { /* ... */ }  </code></pre>  <p>Of course I can define it in many ways to workround this situation like have: </p>  <pre><code>@Path("/providers")  class Provider {       @Path("/{providerId}/service-points")     public ServicePointResource getServicePointResource() { }        @Path("/")      class ServicePointResource {            // here implemented subresource sepcific code       }   }   @Path("/service-points") class ServicePointResource {     // here emplemented resource sepcific code   }  </code></pre>  <p>or just have: </p>  <pre><code>@Path("/")  class ProviderServicePointResource {    // here subresource specific code }    @Path("/service-points")  class ServicePointResource {   // here resource specific code   }  </code></pre>  <p>Subresource approach seems to be natural but using ServicePoint just as global Resource to access it in some cases without Provider demarcation seems also important.  I also could use here: </p>  <pre><code>/service-points/1+3  // to represent composite key  /providers/1/service-points/3 // but it seems more natural  </code></pre>  <p>Any hints?</p>
