<p>I have JAX-RS RESTful web service and I consider how can I pass through query param composite identifier (composite PK)</p>  <p>I have <strong>ServicePoint</strong> and <strong>ProviderService</strong> and: </p>  <pre><code>ServicePointId consist of (ProviderId, ServicePointNumber) ProviderService consist of (ProviderId, ServiceId)  </code></pre>  <p>So I would like to have query with filtering <strong>@QueryParam</strong> and I want to pass through this param ServicePointId which have composite PK. </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:port/rest/provider-services?servicePointId=20+1 http://localhost:port/rest/provider-services?servicePointId=[20,1] http://localhost:port/rest/provider-services?servicePointId=20,1 http://localhost:port/rest/provider-services?servicePointId=(20,1) </code></pre>  <p>Which one will be the best approach?  I can also add that I would like to take multiple servicePointId params in single query like </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:post/rest/provider-services?servicePointId=x&amp;servicePointId=x </code></pre>  <p>So solution like passing providerId and servicePointNumber as separate @QueryParams doesn't seem very pleasing.</p>
