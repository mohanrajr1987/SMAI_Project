<p>I am experiencing an issue where that if multiple <code>Host</code> headers are sent with a request, only the last one gets used.</p>  <p>This causes all of our generated URLs to use that host name instead of the origin host's name.  We are using RestEASY and I was wondering if there are ways to intercept the request before the modification of the headers takes place.</p>  <p>I've tried using RestEASY's PreProcessInterceptor but the server name field on the request is still the wrong host.  More details can be found in this SO post: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32727449/resteasy-host-header-being-overridden">RestEASY Host header being overridden</a></p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
