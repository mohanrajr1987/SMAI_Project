<p>I am currently working on a RESTeasy based RESTful service. I have a filter class which serves as a server request filter as well as a server response filter (i.e. it implements <code>ContainerRequestFilter</code> and <code>ContainerResponseFilter</code> interfaces). </p>  <p>At the beginning of the request, I use the filter to put an object into <code>ThreadLocal</code>. This object is used by the resources throughout the request. At the end of the request, before sending out the response, the filter removes the object from <code>ThreadLocal</code>.</p>  <p>My question is that is there a guarantee that the the request filter, the resource and the response filter will all execute in the same thread? Is there a possibility that after the request filter puts the object into <code>ThreadLocal</code>, a different thread will execute the request (and thus not have access to the object)?</p>  <p>I was sure that this was the case but then I saw this <a href="http://jersey.576304.n2.nabble.com/Does-filter-method-of-ContainerRequestFilter-run-in-resource-method-thread-td7582648.html" rel="nofollow">http://jersey.576304.n2.nabble.com/Does-filter-method-of-ContainerRequestFilter-run-in-resource-method-thread-td7582648.html</a> (official Jersey forum) and now I have doubts.</p>
