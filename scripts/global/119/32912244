<p>Would someone be so kind to point me to a tutorial on installing Google-api-php-client. Now that things have moved to GitHub, with my inexperience, I'm not able to download the library. I'm told to </p>  <p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client</a></p>  <p>but I don't understand what to do from here. I doesn't work in a command window. It appears that I may need JSON which I haven't figured out how to install either. </p>  <p>So, how do I get the necessary files downloaded to my local machine with XAMPP/Apache?</p>  <p>Windows XP, XAMPP 3.1.0, php 5.4.7</p>
