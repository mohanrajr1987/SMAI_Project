<p>I have a web application I'm moving from SVN to git and when I place the files/folders into my new repository folder I only get 2773 of 3897 files to be staged. I even tried chunking the stage process but I still end up with the same result. </p>  <p>I'm a new to git and I setup a new repository for this application in BitBucket using Gitflow. I haven't changed any defaults or anything but I'm concerned not all of my files are making it through. Is there some setting I need to change for this?</p>
