<p>Lucky for me, win10 decided to BSOD me exactly when i was pushing my local branch. After reboot, git could not keep track of my repo.</p>  <p><code>git status</code> returned: <code>fatal: Failed to resolve HEAD as a valid ref.</code>.</p>  <p>I checked this <code>.git/HEAD</code> pointed to <code>refs/heads/&lt;my-branch&gt;</code>. I opened that file and it contains gibberish, whilst <code>refs/heads/master</code> contains a hash of some sort.</p>  <p>Is there any way to repair my local repo?</p>
