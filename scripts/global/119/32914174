<p>I'm trying out git with a Rails app. I created a new branch for a feature, messed it up and now want to start over from the master branch. So I <code>git checkout master</code>, a branch I left before I had any work done in the new feature branch.</p>  <p>From what I read, I was under the impression that by doing this I would now be working in my app as it was in the last commit before the new branch, but all the files are still the same as it was in the new branch I was just working on. The new feature model, controller, migration etc, everything is still there. I didn't even commit the last changes in the new branch, but they still show up in the files that I thought were supposed to be from the previous <code>master</code> state.</p>  <p>Is my git installation malfunctioning or am I missing something? How exactly do I get back to working on the state I had before creating the new branch? Reading the docs I can't figure out where I went wrong.</p>
