<p>I'm working on a website, and I created a repository on my text server on my local computer and push(<code>git push origin master</code>) to my bitbucket remote repository. I have only one branch which is master. I then created another repository on my live server Centos(<code>public_html/</code>) by doing</p>  <pre><code>git init git pull origin master (for the first time pull from the remote repository) </code></pre>  <p>it pull all the files from the remote repository successfully. </p>  <p>however, when I did some changes on my local server and pushed to the remote repository, and tried to pull it again from my centos server by doing</p>  <pre><code>git pull origin master </code></pre>  <p>It seems it didn't pull the new commits successfully </p>
