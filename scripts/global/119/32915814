<p>We sometimes use SourceTree as client. It handles various line endings OK, but the diff tool it uses does not. It sees all lines ending in LF as one line.</p>  <p>As a result, we keep all source in our repository with CRLF.</p>  <p>I'm looking at installing a git client. I can't find the correct setting for TEXT or AUTOCRLF. It seems like they all want to "normalize" the file on check in to LF.</p>  <p>I want to Convert to CRLF on checkout; and either Convert to CRLF on checkin; or Do nothing on checkin;</p>  <p>The best I can find so far is  -text: Do nothing on checkin or checkout;</p>  <p>Is there any hope?</p>  <p>Thanks, Brad.</p>
