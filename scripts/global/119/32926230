<p>Say I am maintaining a legacy application. Adding a feature requires addition of boilerplate code, and currently the fastest way to do this is to use the <code>git diff</code> of a merge of a similar feature, which contains only changes to apply that feature, and copy and paste them to wear its relevant. Copy and pasting however wastes time so I'm looking to speed this process up.</p>  <p>Say for example, adding an extra control on a form in a legacy webapp. I would add a getter and setter, and an instance variable in the class, the html for the control, getting the value from post in a controller, and redundant boilerplate code, that I would have to duplicate the next time I want to update that form.</p>  <p>Since this kind of change doesn't require any removals, I would like to take the <code>diff</code> and simply apply it again, so it appears at the lines where the changes took place, or any other suggestion that would make this process less laborious, the solution feels like it lies here.</p>
