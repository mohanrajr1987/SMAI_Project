<p>I'm playing with a Qt project in Windows. Actually I'm preparing it to build on Linux also. The problem is that the build.sh script (below) inflates 1 byte per line (*) somewhere in the process which makes it fail when it gets executed by the end user. </p>  <p>*I'm comparing the size in the developer machine against the size in the end user machine. Between these, Jenkins (running on Windows) get things form git server and packs a tar.gz file (using cygwin), which the end user gets after all. </p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash qmake Project.pro make make clean </code></pre>  <p>How should I approach this issue?</p>  <p>May I provide more information?</p>
