<p>I'm very new to Git, so facing some issues with it correct usage. Here is my scenario.</p>  <p>I have a fork of my master repository and cloned it into my local. In that, I have 2 branches for different fixes.</p>  <p>When I commit, I saw a statement in the git-we saying that I'm 3 commits ahead and around 20 commits behind.</p>  <p>I understand that my fork is not in sync with master. Also I need to merge the two branches too (or should i do it?)</p>  <p>I used the windows client to syncing. But seems I'm not following the Git way. So, I tried to follow the steps described in <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/" rel="nofollow">https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/</a> which is giving me an error as follows  (I'm using windows).</p>  <pre><code> $&gt;git fetch upstream  fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.   Please make sure you have the correct access rights  and the repository exists. </code></pre>  <p>I'm a bit confused. Please help me with steps I should follow in this scenario.</p>  <p>@HuStmpHrrr</p>  <p>Sorry for adding the details in comments I'll modify the question for readability</p>  <p>By executing the command:</p>  <pre><code>  $&gt;git remote  returning two values   acme-development (which the name of my actual/main repository, from where I forked) and   origin </code></pre>  <hr>  <p><strong>Adding some more info.</strong></p>  <hr>  <p>After making a fetch, I tried a origin/master merge on to my master Please see the screenshot <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9WeWi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9WeWi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But, if I login to my Github online account, it is saying a different story.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P0YrD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P0YrD.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My git client says that <strong>the local repo is up to date</strong>. But the online git says that we are 42 commits behind and 7 commits ahead.</p>
