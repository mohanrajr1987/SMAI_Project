<p>Are private repos on the more popular git sites (Github, Bitbucket etc) truly private in the sense that they aren't accessible even if a non-contributor has the exact url? I was told that some are accessible on github for example if they were created before 8/2014, is this true? Thanks in advance for any insight.</p>
