<p>I have an issue and I am not sure what is happening. I have a repository on bitbucket that only I use, and I have only done simple pushes of my code. When I got on today my code in one of my directories is missing. Replaced with this:</p>  <p>Well I can't post pictures, but this is the text that is where my files are supposed to be:</p>  <pre><code>DualLoops â†’ 8635cc0a2c54 [8635cc0a2c54] </code></pre>  <p>Any idea where my code might have gone off to?</p>
