<p>I abhore manual, tedious and repetitive tasks as any normal developer should. Recently I realized - creating pull requests on numerous git repos taking up too much of my time. And most of the time you have to follow almost exact steps over and over:</p>  <ul> <li>log into git provider's web client - we use Stash</li> <li>click, click, click until you find "Create Pull Request" button, then click it</li> <li>select a branch - usually it's a branch that's just been pushed</li> <li>select a target branch - most of the time it's "develop"</li> <li>add reviewers - most of the time exact same people</li> <li>add description - optional</li> </ul>  <p>At some point I started wondering if I could do all that without using web client. And it seems to be possible. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/aeffle/ssh-support-for-pull-request" rel="nofollow">Stash and Bitbucket have an api</a>, <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#create-a-pull-request" rel="nofollow">Github has one as well</a> (although it is different - the first one uses ssh and the latter http)</p>  <p>Now, this thing would probably simplify some things, yet I feel it can be even better. </p>  <p>I use Emacs (Spacemacs distro, to be specific). Now I'm wondering if anyone already built anything that integrates with <code>magit</code>, or maybe I could do it myself? I mean how difficult would it be?  Script should let you commit and then push the branch and then create a pull-request based of that branch against "develop", using given defaults. Has anyone done anything like that? </p>  <p>Can you guys point me at some <code>elisp</code> plugins that utilize power of <code>magit</code> for doing similar stuff. Maybe I'd be able to write something myself. </p>
