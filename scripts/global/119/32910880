<p>I created ssh key and added it to github. But when I launch <code>$ ssh -vT git@github.com</code> I got the error <strong>Permission denied (publickey)</strong>. I tried several different methods but I got the same error. Still I want to add SwiftyDropbox to my project but I get <strong>Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository.</strong> But I all made by order. I don't know what do I do? Please help me.</p>  <pre><code>    I make following for install SwiftyDropbox     MacBook-Pro:~ Alexsander$ cd Desktop     MacBook-Pro:Desktop Alexsander$ cd Apple     MacBook-Pro:Apple Alexsander$ cd Development     MacBook-Pro:Development Alexsander$ cd TestCocao     MacBook-Pro:TestCocao Alexsander$ cd PodsTest     MacBook-Pro:PodsTest Alexsander$ pod setup     Setting up CocoaPods master repo Setup completed MacBook-Pro:PodsTest Alexsander$ touch Podfile MacBook-Pro:PodsTest Alexsander$ open Podfile MacBook-Pro:PodsTest Alexsander$ pod install Updating local specs repositories [!] Error installing SwiftyDropbox [!] /usr/bin/git clone git@github.com:dropbox/SwiftyDropbox.git /var/folders/vl/6w14j04s5n11cgfcrgwdql940000gn/T/d20151002-1479-17ri6hu --single-branch --depth 1 --branch 0.4  Cloning into '/var/folders/vl/6w14j04s5n11cgfcrgwdql940000gn/T/d20151002-1479-17ri6hu'...
