<p>I have an Android "stored" in a Github repository. Now I did a complete rewrite of the app (started from fresh in another repository) - (how) is it possible to push the complete new repository to the existing one, but keeping it's commit history?</p>  <p>I guess I do not want to use the -f flag, as the commits are removed then. The best case would be to have the complete history of both repositories, but the code should only be from the new one.</p>
