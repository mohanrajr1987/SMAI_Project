<p>I've got a rather messy branch on my hands. It has undergone several instances of </p>  <pre><code>git merge master </code></pre>  <p>If I do the git rebase -i with a lot of squashed, I'll have to re-fix the conflicts that I resolved in the merges.</p>  <p>My impression is that </p>  <pre><code>git checkout master git merge --squash </code></pre>  <p>would end up with the desired result without the manual remerging. Is my best bet:</p>  <pre><code>git checkout master git checkout -b clean-new-branch git merge --squash my-messy-branch </code></pre>  <p>and the reset my branch onto the end of clean-new-branch, abandoning my prior history?</p>
