<p>I have created a project in Visual Studio Online, and then cloned this repo in Visual Studio, I then tried to create a new project in this repo by choosing "new" from the "solutions" section in the home screen in team explorer window in Visual Studio, but I don't want to create a project that contains DLL, all I want to do is to create a basic html site with Angular functionality without DLL and stored in VSO, how can I do that?</p>
