<p>I read about this nice <a href="https://eclipse.org/jgit/download/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse plugin called JGit</a> which allows one to use Git without installing it on the machine and commit from within Eclipse.</p>  <p>However, on their page, there are no instructions on how to install it. I've also tried "Install New Software" in Eclipse, but it was unable to find JGit.</p>  <p>How do you install it?</p>
