<p>Without considering any implementation behaviour or host ᴏꜱ, are there by design, characters which aren't allowed in file or directory names?</p>  <p>I’m especially interested <em>(considering Git is sometimes used as front-end)</em> if the ASCII NUL character is allowed.<br> If this isn’t allowed, can the attempt to create such file with libgit2 lead to remote code execution ?</p>
