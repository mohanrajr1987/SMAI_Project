<p>I recently added a file to my .gitignore, but my repository contains previous commits that include that file. Commits from here on out no longer track the ignored file thanks to using </p>  <pre><code>git rm --cached config/secrets.yml </code></pre>  <p>Is there a quick git command that will go through all of my previous commits and remove that file from showing in my commit history? </p>
