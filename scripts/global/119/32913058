<p>I am new to Bower/Grunt and made a mistake when adding a package to bower by using the GitHub page and not the .git file url. I have erroneously installed the package using </p>  <pre><code>bower install https://github.com/knsv/mermaid --save </code></pre>  <p>To remedy I tried:</p>  <pre><code>bower uninstall mermaid </code></pre>  <p>however now I still see the package listed when I type 'bower list' I am assuming that the --save option added the dependency to my bower.json file and my first thought is to simply remove the reference in this file.</p>  <p>Will modifying this file cause any unforeseen issues?</p>
