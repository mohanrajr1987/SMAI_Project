<p>In Drupal 7 views, is there a way to apply filter option to just one of the field (column?). I searched around for this but cannot find any information or module about it.</p>  <p>For example I have a taxonomy based view, and have 2 content types which has term reference and a value attached (field collection) to that taxonomy. The view output looks like this:</p>  <pre> Term ID | Nid | Content type | Amount | 1       | 2   | Type A       | 5      | 1       | 3   | Type A       | 10     | 1       | 4   | Type B       | 15     | 2       | 5   | Type A       | 20     | </pre>  <p>If I filter by content type = B, then I get this</p>  <pre> Term ID | Nid | Content type | Amount | 1       | 4   | Type B       | 15     | </pre>  <p>What I want to achieve is something like this instead</p>  <pre> Term ID | Type A | Type B | 1       | 5      |        | 1       | 10     |        | 1       |        | 15     |  2       | 20     |        | </pre>
