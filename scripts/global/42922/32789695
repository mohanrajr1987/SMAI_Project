<p>I have a custom content type called events which has a few fields defined in it. </p>  <p>The field name is <code>field_store_name</code>. I can get all the options from these check boxes using this code: </p>  <pre><code>$form['field_store']['und']['#options'] </code></pre>  <p>This is how I get the option(s) that are <strong>selected/checked</strong>. Is this the correct way of doing this?</p>  <pre><code>$form_state['build_info']['args']['0']-&gt;field_store['und'] </code></pre>  <p>Thanks</p>
