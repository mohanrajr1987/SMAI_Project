<p>I tried installing Drupal on my local server, and everything worked fine. I installed Drupal on my localhost, and then I tried to transfer the same Drupal directory on my server using FileZilla. Changed my <code>settings.php</code> file in accordance to my server MySql settings as follows:</p>  <pre><code>$databases = array (   'default' =&gt;    array (     'default' =&gt;      array (       'database' =&gt; 'manas_drupal',       'username' =&gt; 'XXXXXXX',       'password' =&gt; 'XXXXXXX',       'host' =&gt; '127.0.0.1',       'port' =&gt; '',       'driver' =&gt; 'mysql',       'prefix' =&gt; '',     ),   ), ); </code></pre>  <p>However, when I tried accessing the website where the Drupal installation should have been present, I encounter the following error:</p>  <pre><code>PDOException: SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused in lock_may_be_available() (line 167 of /home/manasge/manas.getevangelized.com/drupal/includes/lock.inc). </code></pre>  <p>Now, line 167 of <code>lock.inc</code> contains the following function:</p>  <pre><code>function lock_may_be_available($name) {   $lock = db_query('SELECT expire, value FROM {semaphore} WHERE name = :name', array(':name' =&gt; $name))-&gt;fetchAssoc();   if (!$lock) {     return TRUE;   }   $expire = (float) $lock['expire'];   $now = microtime(TRUE);   if ($now &gt; $expire) {     // We check two conditions to prevent a race condition where another     // request acquired the lock and set a new expire time. We add a small     // number to $expire to avoid errors with float to string conversion.     return (bool) db_delete('semaphore')       -&gt;condition('name', $name)       -&gt;condition('value', $lock['value'])       -&gt;condition('expire', 0.0001 + $expire, '&lt;=')       -&gt;execute();   }   return FALSE; } </code></pre>  <p>What seems to be wrong here? Everything works fine on my localhost, but I can't seem to get this thing working on my main host. For reference, this is the link where my Drupal directory is hosted:  <code>http://manas.getevangelized.com/drupal/</code></p>  <p>Also, I have an empty database named <code>manas_drupal</code> defined in PHPMyAdmin already. Also, I made sure that the username and password for MySQL in <code>settings.php</code> were entered correctly.</p>
