<p>Today, out of the blue, my drupal 7 website began to show the message:</p>  <pre><code>Unable to connect with the reCAPTCHA server (www.google.com): 110: Connection timed out </code></pre>  <p>In log error, i found out that gives error also for sending confirmation mail for new accounts and that i'm not able anymore to get long term access token from facebook from facebook wall module. It seems like drupal can't connect to outside world... Any clue, i don't see, about what is going on?</p>  <p>The ubuntu server of the site is up and running, the site is reachable.</p>
