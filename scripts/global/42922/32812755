<p>I am new in drupal. I want to customize and style my login or my registration form. There are some predefined blocks in <code>Admin|Structure|Blocks</code>. Login form is one of these predefined blocks and I want to show it in a specific region in my <code>page.tpl.php</code> page. the following code in <code>page.tpl.php</code> shows a login form. I want to style it with bootstrap css. How can I do that? I have searched a lot and found some code in template.php and so on. But none of them worked. :( Thank You For Your Help!</p>  <pre><code> &lt;?php  if($page['login_region'])          print render($page['login_region']);   ?&gt; </code></pre>
