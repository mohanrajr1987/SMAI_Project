<p>I have installed Composer on C drive (C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data). I have a drupal7 project on D drive (D:\wamp\www\drupal71).</p>  <p>I have installed Drush by this command: <strong>composer global require drush/drush:7.*</strong> and it successfully downloaded but skipped installing because of naming conflicts. Please see the attached screen shot. </p>  <p>Now when I run the drush command drush status, it shows that "<em>drush is not recognized as an internal or external command</em>".</p>  <p>Can you please guide / help me?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JTSVJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JTSVJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
