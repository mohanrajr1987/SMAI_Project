<pre><code>function cdw_taxonomy_baseurl_filter_url_inbound_alter(&amp;$path, $original_path, $path_language){} </code></pre>  <p>My goal is to alter the url based on the path a user is on and I am not sure whether to initially check the $path or $original path first.</p>  <p>If a user visits 'taxonomy/term/%' I want to append an additional contextual filter on the end, ie. taxonomy/term/%/%. However, as a result of a user visiting a path like taxonomy/term/85 the url will alias to wwww.example.com/banks, with banks being the taxonomy term that maps to 85.</p>
