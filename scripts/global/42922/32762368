<p>I'm trying to import an old site into Drupal 7 using the feeds plugin.</p>  <p>I have written an export module to create a CSV file with my old data and I'm trying to import this file in Drupal.</p>  <p>This seems to work fine. However, two things are going wrong:</p>  <ol> <li>all quotes are removed from my csv file (quotes are important in certain text fields!) - I absolutely need to find a way to keep them.</li> <li>cr/lf (newline) characters can obviously not be used because they indicate a new record. But certain textfields contain newlines in my old site. I've tried replacing them with \n but \n is imported literally.</li> </ol>  <p>Any ideas on how to cope with these bugs/problems?</p>
