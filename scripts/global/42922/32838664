<p>I have custom views ( using views module ), which are pages where they display list of nodes ( based on taxonomy ). So i have my exmaple.com/tv-shows where it shows a list of nodes where field_taxonomy_category equals "tv-show". I have another view cooking. </p>  <p>Now .. i want all those lists, "tv-shows", "cooking" and rest of the categories on my website, to make a custom display. I want to change the whole html structure of those lists.</p>  <p>Any suggestion how to do that in a best way ? Thanks</p>
