<p>I have a page type "Promotion". The page's template has a region, inside the region there are two blocks (created with structures/blocks) being rendered.</p>  <p>I have different versions of the blocks (text, color, etc). What I want to do is have a THEMENAME_preprocess (?) function to switch between blocks depending on a specific condition.</p>  <p>For example: if user is a member then display block-21 and block-22, if user did this or that then display block-23 and block-24.</p>  <p>Can you please advice me how to do that?</p>
