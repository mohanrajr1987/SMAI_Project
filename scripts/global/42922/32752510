<p><strong>Hi everyone!</strong> I know. I write the English language really bad, horrible. I apologize.</p>  <p>I created a blog (with the core's <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/blog" rel="nofollow">blog module</a>). Also I have a content type called <strong>my-content-type</strong> :). I need the blog teaser view is displayed in <strong>my-content-type</strong>.</p>  <p>I installed <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ds" rel="nofollow">Display Suite</a>. So, my-content-type has the <em>Display settings</em> option. With this option I can choose the desired view, in my case the teaser view. OK, very good! Now, but how do I get the blog teaser view is displayed in my-content-type?</p>  <p>Can I do this without Views?</p>  <p>Greetings!</p>
