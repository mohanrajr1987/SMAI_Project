<p>I am building a navigation menu in drupal 7 and in a few of the menu links it is not possible to edit the "path" in the page "Edit menu links" (under Structure -> Menu -> Navigation). Instead there is a fixed path to for ex. "Add new basic page". </p>  <p>These links also have the option "reset" in stead of "delete"... under Structure -> Menus.</p>  <p>I realize that I must have brought this problem on myself, but I am stuck and cannot figure out how to change the path for these menu links.</p>  <p>So I would like to change the "path". Can someone point me in the right direction?</p>
