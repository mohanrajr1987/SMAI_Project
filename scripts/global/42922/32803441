<p>I have a problem but do not know how to move, so I would advise ...</p>  <p>I want to create a dynamic menu in drupal (main-menu). The current one is ugly, is a list. I want a menu where there are different voices, and during the hover event appears a little window (with the sub). Or by moving a menu with submenus that are activated at the click of the item.</p>  <p>I have no problem with JavaScript to create anything ...</p>  <p>The real problem is that I do not know how to act to achieve this. In my case the main-menu is created (I think) from the <strong>module block</strong>.</p>  <p>Maybe I should change something in the form?</p>  <p>I wish I had some of your advice ... There are lightweight modules that allow me to create menus that? (editable adding file.js) ???</p>  <p>Thanks a lot..</p>  <p>and sorry if the question is too general.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>practically the main-menu is called <strong>#block-system-main-menu</strong>, I could create a js file that runs every "tag li" (menu items), and bring up submenus durnate the hover or click?</p>  <p>You think it's good as an idea? fast? or weight code, slow to load?</p>
