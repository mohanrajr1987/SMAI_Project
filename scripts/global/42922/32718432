<p>I've got a Drupal website and I'd like to send an email via Marketo whenever a new post is created. I've got the Drupal side of things covered (I know how to create the custom module that will be triggered whenever a new content us created).</p>  <p>What I don't know is whether:</p>  <p>1) Marketo API allows for this? 2) How? As when I was trying to follow <a href="http://developers.marketo.com/documentation/asset-api/create-email/" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial, I got stuck on the <code>$clientId</code> and <code>$clientSecret</code> as these values are now available under <code>Integration/LauchPoint</code> nor in <code>Integration/Web Services</code></p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
