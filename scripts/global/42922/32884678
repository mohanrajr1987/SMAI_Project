<p>I have created a view, view machine name is as 'list_events' and display machine name is 'black', I have also added three filters: </p>  <p>a) Content: Published (Yes)</p>  <p>b) Content: Type (= Event)</p>  <p>c) Content: Event Type (= Paid)</p>  <p>This displays fine in second sidebar.</p>  <p>Now I want to embed this view in sidebar one in one of the block. For this I created a custom module called as 'show event' and added following code in it::</p>  <pre><code>function show_event_block_view($delta = '') {print_r($delta);   if ($delta == 'event') {     $viewName = 'list_events';     $viewsHtml = views_embed_view($viewName, 'block', '1', 'Event', 'Free');     return $viewsHtml;   } } </code></pre>  <p>But it never considers my new parameter for example "Free", it always take "Paid" . (Please note first 2 parameters are same in both case).</p>
