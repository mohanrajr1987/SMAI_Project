<p>In a SQLite3 database, I have a table "<em>projects</em>" which <em>id</em> field is composed the following way:</p>  <pre><code>[user id]_[user's project id] </code></pre>  <p>For example, with <strong>user id=45</strong>, here is some data:</p>  <pre><code>45_1 45_10 45_102 45_2 45_3 45_4 45_68 45_9 </code></pre>  <p>I need to <strong>get the max of the project id</strong>, which is the number after the '_' delimiter (which is <em>102</em> in the example). How can I achieve that?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
