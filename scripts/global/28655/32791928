<p>I have to check if some of the names of the users in a SQLite3 database is the same to something.</p>  <pre><code>$db     = new SQLite3('../usuarios.db'); $results    = $db-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM usuarios');  while($row = $results-&gt;fetchArray()){  if($row['nombre']==$_GET['n']){     // bootstrap class     echo "has-error "; } else {     // bootstrap class     echo "has-success "; } }  $db-&gt;close(); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that I receive as many has-error and has-success as rows the db have.</p>  <p>If I could put the result of the query in an array I could use in_array(), but with fetchArray() you only have the first row.</p>  <p>I don't know how to solve it.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
