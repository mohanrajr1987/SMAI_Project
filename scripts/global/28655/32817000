<p>I want to backup sqlite3 file in heroku server. With a command <code>heroku db:pull sqlite:///Users/ironsand/backup.db</code>, I got a error.</p>  <pre><code> !    `db:pull` is not a heroku command.  !    Perhaps you meant `pg:pull`.  !    See `heroku help` for a list of available commands. </code></pre>  <p>It seems <code>db</code> command isn't available anymore and I couldn't find a way to backup the sqlite database from heroku.</p>  <p>How can I do it?</p>
