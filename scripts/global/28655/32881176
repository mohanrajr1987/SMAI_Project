<p>My application logs user access to sqlite database, the <strong>my.db</strong> file grows about 5Gb every month. There're tables like "<strong>access</strong>" which logs every user access, this table should be cleared at every beginning of the month, and it holds almost all the 5gb data. Another table "<strong>user</strong>" which holds all my users, this table should always keep its data. </p>  <p>So every month I need to:</p>  <ol> <li>ctrl+c -> ctrl+v <strong>my.db</strong> to clone a file copy(for future statistics), this is very slow for 5gb file.</li> <li>clear the "<strong>access</strong>" table via "<strong>delete from access</strong>" and "<strong>vacuum</strong>", it also takes some time. </li> </ol>  <p>It's too slow. I wonder if there is a sql command like "<strong>export/import database structure and indices</strong>" to clone only the structure to another new.db, and then "<strong>copy * from mydb.user to newdb</strong>"</p>  <p>Or maybe some existing tool can do this?</p>
