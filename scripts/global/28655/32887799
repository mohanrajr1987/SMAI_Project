<p>In <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/connect-table-types-odbc-table-type-accessing-tables-from-other-dbms/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> (under the section "Multiple ODBC tables"), it is mentioned that it is feasible to have a table in multiple remote databases be represented as one table in MariaDB. I'm having some trouble setting this up properly with SQLite3.</p>  <p>I have two SQLite3 databases: <code>D1.dat</code> and <code>D2.dat</code> connected to the MariaDB server through the CONNECT engine. Each database contains a table named <code>merge</code>, that has a column <code>col</code> represented by a type <code>int</code>. In <code>D1.dat</code>, this table contains values 1,2 and 3 and in <code>D2.dat</code>, the table contains 4, 5 and 6.</p>  <p>In my <code>odbc.ini</code> file, I have these two entries:</p>  <pre><code>[SQLite] Description = Test DB1 Driver = SQLite Database = /path/to/DB1.dat  [SQLite] Description = Test DB2 Driver = SQLite Database = /path/to/DB2.dat </code></pre>  <p>Then, I use the following query to create my <code>merge</code> table on a MariaDB database:</p>  <pre><code>create table merge(col int) engine=CONNECT table_type=ODBC multiple=1 Connection='DSN=SQLite;DBQ=/path/to/DB*.dat;'; </code></pre>  <p>and when I do <code>select * from merge</code>, I get:</p>  <pre><code>+------+ | col  | +------+ |    1 | |    2 | |    3 | |    1 | |    2 | |    3 | +------+ </code></pre>  <p>It's like the values from the first database in my <code>odbc.ini</code> file are repeated twice. I was expecting something like this:</p>  <pre><code>+------+ | col  | +------+ |    1 | |    2 | |    3 | |    4 | |    5 | |    6 | +------+  </code></pre>  <p>Note that if I create a third database named DB3.dat located at the same place as the others, the same query returns three times the same values.</p>  <p>Anyone got a solution why I am not getting the expected output?</p>
