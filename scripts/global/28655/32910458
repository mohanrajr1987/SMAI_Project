<p>Trying to compare 2 tables in the same db.  Table 1 is the main historical table, table 2 is the temporary table with new data rcvd from server and used to update table 1. </p>  <p>Need to output the items in table 1 that have a change in one of the fields on table 2. </p>  <p>i.e. table 1(Services)</p>  <pre> Service - folder- s2 - Real - s4 astatus - on    - on - on - on  </pre>  <p>table 2(Services2)</p>  <pre> Service - folder - s2 - Real  - s4 astatus - on     - on - off - on </pre>  <p>So I need the output to indicate that Real in astatus table 1 is off (again table 2 is just the reference temp table with new data to update table 1) I have all the updates and remaining code done. But i'm stuck on this comparison part...</p>  <p>my code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>cursor.execute("""Select inner.compare FROM     (Select a.Real = aReal, b.Real = bReal     FROM Services a     JOIN Services2 b     ON     (lower(a.Service || a.Folder) = lower(b.Service || b.Folder)))inner.compare     WHERE inner.astat != inner.bstat""") print inner.compare </code></pre>
