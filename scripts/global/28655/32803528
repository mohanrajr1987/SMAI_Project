<p>I have a table in my sqlite database with a "position" column (for sorting/display order), and I want a UNIQUE constraint on it. But this constraint prevents me from updating multiple records in one query (for example, <code>UPDATE things SET position = position + 1</code>). Is there anything I can do to "defer" the constraint check until after the entire query has executed (sort of like how you can use <code>DEFERRED</code> on foreign key constraints)?</p>  <p>Sample code:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE test (   id integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,   position integer NOT NULL,   title varchar(255) NOT NULL ); CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_position ON test (position ASC);   INSERT INTO test (position, title) VALUES (0, 'first item'); INSERT INTO test (position, title) VALUES (1, 'second item'); INSERT INTO test (position, title) VALUES (2, 'third item');  UPDATE test SET position = position + 1; -- &lt;-THIS IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO </code></pre>
