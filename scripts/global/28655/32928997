<p>I am using sqlite3 and I am trying to retrieve all rows ordered by some col1 with null values coming last. As of now I am using this kind o query:</p>  <pre><code>select * from table order by row1 is null, row1 asc </code></pre>  <p>As there are many rows in my table, the query worked quite slowly, so I decided to create an index on table(row1). </p>  <p>After creating the index it extremely improved the speed of queries like:</p>  <pre><code>select * from table order by row1 asc </code></pre>  <p>However sqlite doesn't seem to use that index with "order by col1 is null" type of queries. </p>  <p>Why sqlite, based on that index, can't just move rows with null values to the end? Is there any way I can make null values come last without the need to evaluate every row every time again? </p>
