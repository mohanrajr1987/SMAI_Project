<p>I have a <a href="/questions/tagged/sqlite3" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;sqlite3&#39;" rel="tag">sqlite3</a> DB with a different tables. What I'm doing is to <code>UPDATE</code> the last inserted row of a table with data from another record af the same table, or from another similar table.</p>  <p>I Got it working but I'm wondering if my solution is correct or something is missing and if I could write it in a more compact and speeder way.</p>  <p>Moreover my code is very very unmanageable, because of if in the future the table structure will change I'll must rewrite the query to add or remove fields.</p>  <p>I was wandering if it's possible to write a <a href="/questions/tagged/sql" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;sql&#39;" rel="tag">sql</a> query that take a whole record from a table and update all <code>NULL</code> fields in another record of the same table.</p>  <pre><code>sprintf(global_sql, "UPDATE "\                         "Table1 "\                     "SET "\                         "fiedl1 = case when fiedl1 is null then (SELECT fiedl1 FROM Table1 WHERE Table1_id = %d) else fiedl1 end, "\                         "fiedl2 = case when fiedl2 is null then (SELECT fiedl2 FROM Table1 WHERE Table1_id = %d) else fiedl2 end, "\                         "fiedl3 = case when fiedl3 is null then (SELECT fiedl3 FROM Table1 WHERE Table1_id = %d) else fiedl3 end "\                     "WHERE "\                         "Table1_id = (SELECT max(Table1_id) FROM Table1)", sourceRecord_idx, sourceRecord_idx, sourceRecord_idx);  </code></pre>  <p>As you can see for each single field I must write its specific <code>SET</code> case and moreover the value for each filed is retrieved by a select. </p>  <p>I guess/hope there is a simplier and more maintainable way to do that.</p>
