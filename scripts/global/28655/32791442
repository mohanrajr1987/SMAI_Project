<p>In the Netbeans version 8 using the Java language under Services,  when I right click on the connection I have setup I keep getting this error</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to connect. Cannot establish a connection to jdbc:sqlite:blah.db using org.sqlite.JDBC (opening db 'blah.db': Access is denied).</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am on windows 7.  I have checked the permissions of the database file and there is no reason not to access the file.   </p>  <p>Netbeans can find the file so the url setting is working.</p>  <p>NO user name or password is set on the database.</p>  <p>I can by use of code open the database and execute a query.   The reason behind doing this via netbeans, is to bind a control to the SQLite database.  </p>  <p>Does anybody have any ideas why I would get an Access Denied error other than a permissions issue?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
