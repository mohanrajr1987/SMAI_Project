<p>I am trying to put together a code that takes over 10000 CSV files to create one database. The CSV files have the same amount of columns but varying lengths of rows.</p>  <p>Please note that my folder with all csv files will have various csv file names, therefore if I am to put together code to grab it, it needs to be open to grabbing ANY csv in this path location.</p>  <p>Question: how can I build my first database with the above prerequisites? Below you will find a sample of the data found in the csv</p>  <pre><code>import glob import os import sqlite3 import csv </code></pre>  <p>Create my database, and connect to it (this is all I have)</p>  <pre><code>sqlite_file = '/Users/USERSNAME/Desktop/my_db.sqlite' conn = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file) cur = conn.cursor() </code></pre>  <p>Sample data from one of the csv</p>  <pre><code>ad1988g7100c    1/25/1988   0.63    0.63    0.63    0.63    0   0 </code></pre>
