<p>I'm trying to connect to an SQLite3 database through PHP however all the code that I have tried has failed and now I'm starting to think that I may have set up my system incorrectly.</p>  <p>I am running Debian Wheezy on a RPI2 and have run the following commands while setting up</p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install apache2 sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 -y sudo apt-get install sqlite3 </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_php.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> is some code that I've tried in my /var/www/index.php file but it norhing appeared on the screen.</p>  <p>I tried putting</p>  <pre><code>echo __LINE__; </code></pre>  <p>at various points, but anything after mentioning the class and it wouldn't return anything.</p>  <p>It seems as though PHP is not recognising the SQLite3 class, however I am far from an expert so anything could be wrong, really.</p>  <p>Any help would really be appreciated</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
