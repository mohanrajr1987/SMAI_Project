<p>I am using sqlite3 on Linux using C++. Calling sqlite3_step, returns SQLITE_BUSY. Going through the documentation of sqlite about this error code, it tells that multiple processes should be involved in this case (<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html#busy" rel="nofollow">https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html#busy</a>).</p>  <p>Yes, in my case multiple processes are involved to access the db. It appears the problem can be resolved using the interface calls sqlite3_busy_handler and sqlite3_busy_timeout. <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_handler.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_handler.html</a> <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_timeout.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_timeout.html</a></p>  <p>Is there any document/working example for the usage of these calls? Please add reference if you have any. Thanks in advance.</p>
