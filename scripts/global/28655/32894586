<p>I am trying to store binary data in a sqlite database using the Twisted adbapi. However, when I run a query to store the data, I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>sqlite3.ProgrammingError: You must not use 8-bit bytestrings unless you use a text_factory that can interpret 8-bit bytestrings (like text_factory = str). It is highly recommended that you instead just switch your application to Unicode strings. </code></pre>  <p>After googling a bit, I found the answer for a normal sqlite connection:</p>  <pre><code>con = sqlite3.connect(...) con.text_factory = str </code></pre>  <p>However, I can't find an equivalent setting to use with a twisted adbapi sqlite connection:</p>  <pre><code>dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("sqlite3", "data.db", check_same_thread=False) </code></pre>  <p>I would appreciate any help!</p>
