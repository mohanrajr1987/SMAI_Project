<p>I am building python (version 3.5) from source in order to get the latest version. I can <code>make</code> python and install it, but several "optional" modules including _sqlite3 are not installing:</p>  <pre><code>$&gt;./configure --prefix=/my/prefix &amp;&amp; make  </code></pre>  <p>Yields the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>...</p>      <p>Python build finished successfully!</p>      <p>The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:</p>      <p>_bz2                  _lzma                 _sqlite3</p>      <p>_ssl                  _tkinter              readline</p>      <p>To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I (frustratedly) installed sqlite3 from source also to ensure sqlite3 development files exist somewhere, and I believe I have set the necessary <code>lib</code> and <code>include</code> paths as per the related <a href="http://www.devsumo.com/technotes/2013/04/building-python-3-3-with-lzma-on-linux-and-os-x/" rel="nofollow">lzma module install tutorial</a>:</p>  <pre><code>$&gt; find / -name libsqlite3.so /home/username/myproject/lib/libsqlite3.so  $&gt; find / -name sqlite3.h /home/username/myproject/include/sqlite3.h  $&gt; echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/username/myproject/lib  $&gt; echo $LDFLAGS -L/home/username/myproject/lib  $&gt; echo $CFLAGS -I/home/username/myproject/include </code></pre>  <p>And yet, when I run <code>./configure --prefix=/my/prefix --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions &amp;&amp; make</code>, I am given the above error that <code>_sqlite3</code> (amongst others) was not installed because the necessary bits were not found. </p>  <p>Based on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12023773/python-3-3-source-code-setup-modules-were-not-found-lzma-sqlite3-tkinter">this related answer</a>, it seems I may need to change <code>setup.py</code>? Is that correct?</p>  <p>Is there really no better way than hacking up the python <code>setup.py</code> script?</p>  <p>By the way, I realize that installing <code>sqlite-dev</code> with <code>yum</code> may fix this issue and put the relevant <code>sqlite3</code> files somewhere obvious to the python installation, but I am not positive that I will be able to do that due that due to limited repository access.</p>
