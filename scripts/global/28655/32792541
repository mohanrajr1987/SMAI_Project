<p>I am attempting to learn how to connect to sqlite3 using C++ on a Mac Xcode compiler.</p>  <p>I have the following include files..</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include "sqlite3.h" </code></pre>  <p>I have tried the two sqlite3 open functions…</p>  <p>sqlite3_open and sqlite3_open_v2</p>  <p>The Xcode tool finds no errors until I try to compile.  Then I get a “Build Failed” error with no further explanation.</p>  <p>What is the likely cause and how can I track down the error? </p>
