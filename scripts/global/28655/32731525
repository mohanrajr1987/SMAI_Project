<p>I have a sqlite table such as below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d1TOq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d1TOq.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Case A: indexNum is primary key, autoincrement.  When I execute the statement </p>  <pre><code>"select StaffID from FingerprintDataTest limit 1 offset 13" </code></pre>  <p>the return staffID is 5789 which is correct.</p>  <p>Case B: indexNum is primary key, autoincrement. StaffID is indexed column.</p>  <p>When I execute the statement </p>  <pre><code> "select StaffID from FingerprintDataTest limit 1 offset 13"  </code></pre>  <p>the return staffID is 1413 which is not the StaffID I want.</p>  <p>I want to index the StaffID column to make query for StaffID faster in case of large data. However, it is messing up my search using offset. Can anyone advice me on this? Thanks.</p>
