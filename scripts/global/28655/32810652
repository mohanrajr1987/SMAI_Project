<p>I am creating a site using Django/Python. I have only just begun the registration page where a user will input their info and the data should flow into the sqlite3 DB which comes with Django. I have since yesterday evening (been just under 24 hours now) trying to figure out why my forms aren't showing up. I tried attaching what I'm getting vs what I'm aiming for but don't have enough reputation points so please visit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfjhLKL-_5Q" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfjhLKL-_5Q</a> 9.09mins for what I'm aiming for.  Please note: The word 'welcome' on the youtube vid has been replaced with 'Thank you' by me. This code is in my views.py. </p>  <p>The issue is that the small boxes which a user would type in their fullname and email in the video (which I have replaced with Profession, first_name, last_name etc) are not appearing at all...  instead I am getting just 'Thank you' appearing along with my 'username' (jmitchel3 equivalent) and registration button but no request for text boxes.  My code is below.</p>  <p>I initially thought that my forms were setup incorrectly so I compared my code to the page that's successful and no luck.  I did the same for models but couldn't see anything there either ...</p>  <pre><code>models.py:  from django.db import models  # Create your models here. class Register(models.Model):      Profession = models.CharField(max_length=120)     first_name = models.CharField(max_length=120)     last_name = models.CharField(max_length=120)     email = models.EmailField(max_length = 120, unique = True)     phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=120)     instgram_ID = models.CharField(max_length=120, blank=True, null=True)     facebook_ID = models.CharField(max_length=120, blank=True, null=True)     twitter_ID = models.CharField(max_length=120, blank=True, null=True)     timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, auto_now=False)     updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=False, auto_now=True)      def __unicode__(self):         return self.email      forms.py      from django import forms  from .models import Register  class RegisterForm(forms.ModelForm):     class Meta:          model = Register         fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'phone_number', 'instgram_ID', 'facebook_ID', 'twitter_ID']      def clean_email(self):         email = self.cleaned_data.get('email')         email_base, provider = email.split("@")         domain, extension = provider.split('.')         #if not domain = 'USC':         #   raise forms.ValidationError("Please make sure you use your USC email.")         #if not extension == "edu":         #   raise forms.ValidationError("Please use a valid .EDU email address")              #return email          def clean_full_name(self):             full_name = self.cleaned_data.get('full_name')             #write validation code.             return full_name          admin.py          from django.contrib import admin      # Register your models here.      from .forms import RegisterForm     from .models import Register      class RegisterAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):         list_display = ["__unicode__", "timestamp", "updated"]         form = RegisterForm         #class Meta:         #   model = Register     )      admin.site.register(Register, RegisterAdmin  views.py  from django.shortcuts import render  from .forms import RegisterForm # Create your views here. def home(request):     title = 'Welcome'     form = RegisterForm(request.POST or None)     context = {     "title": title,      "form": form      }      if form.is_valid():         instance = form.save(commit=False)         if not instance.full_name:             instance.full_name = "Justin"         instance.save      context = {         "title": "Thank you"         }      return render(request, "home.html", context)  home.html:  &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;  {{ user }} {{ request.user }}  &lt;form method ='POST' action=''&gt;{% csrf_token %}  {{ form }}  &lt;input type='submit' value = 'Register'&gt;  &lt;!-- &lt;input&gt; type='text'&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;input&gt; --&gt;      &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It's been a while since I have been on here so if I need to add anything else, let me know..</p>
