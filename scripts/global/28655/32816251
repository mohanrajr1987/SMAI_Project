<p>So I'm in the process of creating some IOS-App using SQLite and FMDB and everything is running smoothly, except for some kindof strange behaviour of the engine regarding NULL-Values</p>  <p>Picture this SQL</p>  <pre><code>    select some_attribute1, someattribute2,   min(some_attribute3) as minday, dh_amstart, dh_amend, dh_pmstart, dh_pmend  from doctor_hours join doctors dr on dr.doc_key = doctor_hours.dh_fkdoc where ((dh_amstart is not null and dh_amend is not null) or (dh_pmstart is not null and dh_pmend is not null)) and dr.doc_fachrichtung = 1 group by dh_fkdoc order by minday, case when DH_amstart is null then 1 else 0 end, DH_amstart, dh_pmstart"]; </code></pre>  <p>So what's happening there, I am selecting some data from a schedule of opening hours of medical doctors. If his office is not open in the morning, values for DH_AMstart end DH_AMend are NULL, then I fetch hours from DH_PMstart and DH_PMend, those are columns of type VARCHAR. </p>  <p>This rather elaborate SQL-statement should return the next available medical doctor... it works perfectly in the SQL-Shell (I use RazorSQL). But when executed within FMDB framework (there i create a string containing the SQL-statement, send it via [db executeQuery:sqlstring] to the database and get a FMResultSet containing the results.</p>  <p>The resultset contains '00:00:00' for the columns containing NULL, thus the sort gives some incorrect results. </p>  <p>I do have a workaround by filtering the '00:00:00' values and doing a sort of the resulting array. But the question remains: </p>  <p>What is happening with my NULL-Value ? Why is the resultset sorted differently in the SQL-Shell and within FMDB? </p>
