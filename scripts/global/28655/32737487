<p>I am trying to install rails, by following instructions that I found online and also instructions that I found in the book Beginning Rails 4. I thought I had installed everything, and managed to create a new Rails application. Here are my commands:</p>  <pre><code>rails new blog rake db:create </code></pre>  <p>Then I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>rake aborted!      LoadError: cannot load such file -- sqlite3/sqlite3_native </code></pre>  <p>I've been reading for about two hours trying to figure out what this is. I think it might have something to do with multiple ruby installations and/or location of gems. </p>  <pre><code>$ which ruby /usr/bin/ruby $ which gem /usr/bin/gem $ which rake /usr/local/bin/rake $ which sqlite3 ~/anaconda/bin/sqlite3  $ echo $PATH  </code></pre>  <p><code>/home/user/anaconda/bin:/home/user/anaconda/bin:/home/user/anaconda/bin:/home/user/anaconda/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/bin</code></p>  <p>Any idea how I can solve this issue?</p>  <p>Here is some additional info:</p>  <pre><code>rails --version Warning: You're using Rubygems 2.0.14 with Spring. Upgrade to at least Rubygems 2.1.0 and run `gem pristine --all` for better startup performance.
