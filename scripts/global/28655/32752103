<p>I followed the Railscast tutorial on how to create a sortable list using JQuery UI.  When I drag the list item to another position in the list, it doesn't save the new order and generates the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Processing by UsersothersupportsController#sort as */*   Parameters: {"usersothersupport"=&gt;["1037", "1036", "1038"]}   SQL (0.0ms)  UPDATE "usersothersupports" SET "position" = 1, "id" = 1037 SQLite3::ConstraintException: UNIQUE constraint failed: usersothersupports.id:  UPDATE "usersothersupports" SET "position" = 1, "id" = 1037 Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 0ms  ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique (SQLite3::ConstraintException: UNIQUE constraint  failed: usersothersupports.id: UPDATE "usersothersupports" SET "position" = 1 , "id" = 1037):   app/controllers/usersothersupports_controller.rb:69:in `block in sort'   app/controllers/usersothersupports_controller.rb:68:in `each'   app/controllers/usersothersupports_controller.rb:68:in `each_with_index'   app/controllers/usersothersupports_controller.rb:68:in `sort' </code></pre>  <p>Any idea on how I can fix this?  I don't want to saturate this post with my code as the fix may be simple (hopefully).  Thanks for your help, everyone.</p>
