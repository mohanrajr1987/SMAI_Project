<p>I am optimizing a small app I wrote to reduce the number of database calls per request, and do not know how to structure my SQL query.</p>  <p>I have data something like this</p>  <pre><code>name   stat1   stat2   stat3 john    1       2       22 john    2       4       -2 richard 3       4       0 john    0       3       1 jacob   12      9       -20 </code></pre>  <p>My current statement is something along the lines of:</p>  <pre><code>userNames = execute("SELECT DISTINCT name FROM ___") for user in userNames:     var userdata = "SELECT avg(stat1), avg(stat2), avg(stat3) FROM ___ WHERE name == '"+str(user) </code></pre>  <p>Now this understandably is not good. It makes 20 calls (thankfully my users table is low right now), but it scales very poorly. (each db call takes .050s)</p>  <p>A friend suggested something along the lines of:</p>  <pre><code>"SELECT avg(stat1),avg(stat2),avg(stat3) from ___ where name in " userNames </code></pre>  <p>But this only returns one row, where I need len(userNames) # of rows. </p>  <p>Is this a good case to use Join? (I am a sql noob).</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
