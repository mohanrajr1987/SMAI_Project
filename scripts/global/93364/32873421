<p>Using VS2013 it was possible, at least with VB.NET, to double click on a control and then the default event would show up in the code file.  Above this there was a pull down list of the other possible events for this control.</p>  <p>Now I'm working in VS2015 and in C#, but that list is not there. I can still double click on a control to get the default event, but I cannot add another event. I don't think I'm supposed to edit the designer file.</p>  <p>How do I do this now? Do I need to add events in the code file now?</p>  <p>for example I want to be able to drop a file on my windows application. So somewhere I need to add the event for this.</p>
