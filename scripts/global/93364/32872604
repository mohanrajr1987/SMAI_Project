<p>So.  I have a solution in Visual Studio 2013 with a kind of a modular structure:</p>  <p>-there are two separate projects in one solution to keep things separated</p>  <p>-main project is the Application itself.</p>  <p>-second project is a UI framework for the app to use but also under development.</p>  <p>-main project has a build dependency from UI framework.</p>  <p>-UI framework is being built as a static library. It's output file location is inside of main project bin folder just to be clearly seen for now.</p>  <p>With this setup I was unable to step into functions from UI framework project during debug time.  This is how the error looks like at link time:</p>  <pre><code>2&gt;Nerv.lib(NervApp.obj) : warning LNK4099: PDB 'vc120.pdb' was not found with 'Nerv.lib(NervApp.obj)' or at 'C:\Users\antius\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\bin\vc120.pdb'; linking object as if no debug info 2&gt;Nerv.lib(NervCommand.obj) : warning LNK4099: PDB 'vc120.pdb' was not found with 'Nerv.lib(NervCommand.obj)' or at 'C:\Users\antius\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\bin\vc120.pdb'; linking object as if no debug info 2&gt;Nerv.lib(NervControllable.obj) : warning LNK4099: PDB 'vc120.pdb' was not found with 'Nerv.lib(NervControllable.obj)' or at 'C:\Users\antius\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\bin\vc120.pdb'; linking object as if no debug info </code></pre>  <p>I've read couple of topics here on stackoverflow and got the general idea of what is going on. The best advice was to compile static library with /Z7 flag, so that debug symbols database was embedded inside lib. Ok, I've tried that. But nothing changed. I still get the same error. Also I've tried to generate pdb file and copy it everywhere across the main project so that the IDE could find it in any case and bind it. But then It writes another type of error, generally saying that this pdb is incorrect somewhy.</p>  <pre><code>2&gt;Nerv.lib(NervApp.obj) : warning LNK4099: PDB 'vc120.pdb' was not found with 'Nerv.lib(NervApp.obj)' or at 'C:\Users\antius\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\bin\vc120.pdb'; linking object as if no debug info 2&gt;Nerv.lib(NervCommand.obj) : warning LNK4099: PDB 'vc120.pdb' was not found with 'Nerv.lib(NervCommand.obj)' or at 'C:\Users\antius\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\REVERSE_VISUAL_AID\bin\vc120.pdb'; linking object as if no debug info </code></pre>  <p>So I dont know what else to do and ask help from the enlightened ones from stackoverflow to help me deal with that.)</p>
