<p>I have a program where in a Text Box a user can type in names and gets suggested autocomplete otpions based on the rows stored in the 'player_name' coloumn of a MySQL database table named 'players'. When the user is happy with the name in the Text Box he would press a button "Choose" as a confirmation of his choice. Now I want to get the name in the text box and display additional information about the selected player (infos that are stored in another columns) in the same form.</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>//AutoComplete Textbox   void AutoCompleteTextbox()  {      PlayerNameField-&gt;AutoCompleteMode = AutoCompleteMode::SuggestAppend;      PlayerNameField-&gt;AutoCompleteSource = AutoCompleteSource::CustomSource;      AutoCompleteStringCollection ^PlayerSearchName = gcnew AutoCompleteStringCollection();      String^ PlayerSearchAgeGroup;       String^ constring = L"datasource=***.**.***.***;port=3306;username=AdminUser;password=****";      MySqlConnection^ conDataBase = gcnew MySqlConnection(constring);      MySqlCommand^ cmdDataBase = gcnew MySqlCommand ("select * from mfs_manager_database.players;", conDataBase);      MySqlDataReader^ myReader;        try      {          conDataBase-&gt;Open();          myReader = cmdDataBase-&gt;ExecuteReader();            while (myReader-&gt;Read())          {               searchName = myReader-&gt;GetString("player_name");              PlayerID = myReader-&gt;GetString("player_id");              String^ searchAgeGroup = myReader-&gt;GetString("player_age_group");              PlayerSearchName-&gt;Add(searchName +" "+ searchAgeGroup);           }       }      catch (Exception^ ex)      {          MessageBox::Show(ex-&gt;Message);      }       PlayerNameField-&gt;AutoCompleteCustomSource = PlayerSearchName;  } private: System::Void button1_Click(System::Object^  sender, System::EventArgs^  e) {          //Disabling Player Name Field           PlayerNameField-&gt;Enabled = false;           //Getting Player Details for display from database            String^ constring = L"datasource=***.**.***.***;port=3306;username=AdminUser;password=****";          MySqlConnection^ conDataBase = gcnew MySqlConnection(constring);          MySqlCommand^ cmdDataBase = gcnew MySqlCommand("SELECT * FROM mfs_manager_database.players WHERE player_id = '"+PlayerID+"';", conDataBase);          MySqlDataReader^ myReader;            try          {              conDataBase-&gt;Open();              myReader = cmdDataBase-&gt;ExecuteReader();                while (myReader-&gt;Read())              {                  String^ getName = myReader-&gt;GetString("player_name");                   NameLabel-&gt;Text = getName;               }           }          catch (Exception^ ex)          {              MessageBox::Show(ex-&gt;Message);          } </code></pre>  <p>Everything works fine except that my I press the "Choose" button I get the ID of the last entry in the database not the selected player's.</p>  <p>Here is what I tried:</p>  <p>-I declared PlayerID and gave it a value '2' before the GetString, same result.</p>  <pre><code>String^ PlayerID = "2";     PlayerID = myReader-&gt;GetString("player_id"); </code></pre>  <p>-I gave PlayerID a value of "2" after the GetString, I get the name of the player occupying ID '2' (as expected)</p>  <pre><code>PlayerID = myReader-&gt;GetString("player_id"); PlayerID = "2"; </code></pre>  <p>-I also checked if the GetString line working properly, I added the 'player_id' to the autocomplete suggestion and it shows the correct ID.</p>  <pre><code>PlayerSearchName-&gt;Add(searchName +" "+ searchAgeGroup + PlayerID); </code></pre>  <p>All of the components seem to work one by one but not all together and I can't see the reason why. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
