<p>In TFS 2013 Web Access when I go to Sprint Board I see only 2 States Active and Closed. </p>  <p>I wanted to add few more statuses like In Progress and Blocked. I downloaded the process Template using the Process editor that is part of TFS Power Tools. </p>  <p>When I looked at the Process Template workflow there is already To do, In Progress, Done and Removed as shown in the figure attached.. </p>  <p>But these are not showing up in the Task Work Item. All I see in state dropdown is Active and Closed.      How do I change it so that I see Active, In-Progress, Completed and Blocked States.</p>  <p>Please help.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7kJr3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7kJr3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
