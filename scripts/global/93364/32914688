<p>I just tried this and it does nothing. TrySetViewBoundsAsync returns false all the time except when MapAnimationKind.None is set, but still does nothing.</p>  <p>I have also tried TrySetViewAsync this does the same as above e.g. nothing</p>  <p>I'm trying to set the bounds of my map control to a route of points I just plotted</p>  <p>The route displays fine but I can't zoom the the extent of the route</p>  <p>I can set a manual zoom but that doesnt quite do what I want especially if the route is large or small</p>  <p>Any ideas ?</p>
