<p>I have a solution with 3 C# projects built in VS2013. It was checked out from GIT but I got all library references missing (marked as yellow triangle) in one project. </p>  <p>But, the same lib references are all ok in the other two projects. </p>  <p>I have tried all solutions in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27208012/all-system-references-missing-visual-studio-2013-nuget-async">All system references missing Visual Studio 2013 NuGet Async</a></p>  <p>but, none of them work for me. </p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> This is part of the c# project file, why they are missing in this project but not in other projects ? </p>  <pre><code>&lt;Reference Include="System" /&gt; &lt;Reference Include="System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations" /&gt; &lt;Reference Include="System.Configuration" /&gt; &lt;Reference Include="System.Core" /&gt; &lt;Reference Include="System.Data.SQLite"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have project 1,2,3 in one solution.</p>  <p>In the same solution, project 1 can find the same lib reference from a local path.</p>  <p>But, when I added the same lib reference from the <strong>same</strong> local path to project 2, it <strong>cannot</strong> find it.</p>  <p>Why ?</p>
