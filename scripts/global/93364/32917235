<p>In VS 2013 the default templates for C# seem to work fine for me, but I have a particular format I use for T-Sql stored procedures.  The default "snippet" produces:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[ap_um_add_county_per_diem_item]     @param1 int = 0,     @param2 int AS     SELECT @param1, @param2 RETURN 0 </code></pre>  <p>but what I want is more involved.  In earlier versions of Visual Studio it was a matter of locating where the template files were, and then modifying the templates in accordance with need.  This appears to have changed in VS 2013.  It is all in "snippets", which is great, but these are a lot more complicated than the old template files.  </p>  <p>It looks like I can edit the snippet files as text in the VS editor, but I wonder if there is a specialized "snippet editor" which will help me out?  I tried using the Code Snippets Manager, but it only provides Add, Remove and Import capability.  No Edit.</p>  <p>Any specific information or advice is welcome!</p>
