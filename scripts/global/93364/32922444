<p>I've already looked for solution, without a success.</p>  <p>I need to use a DLL supplied by third parties on Visual Studio 2013(running on (x64) Windows 10). On machine there are both OpenCV 3.0.0 and OpenCV2.410 installed and working.</p>  <p>The DLL's author has provided a .lib file and He says that in order to use this DLLs in your project, you need to put some others OpenCV's dlls in the project folder( I've tried to put these DLLs in every project folder[yes I know, it has no sense, but after a lot of tries i've lost my patience])</p>  <p>What he supplies is an .dll and an example project( that doesn't work for me because it needs OpenCV2.1 and there are instructions needs to be translate in newest version [and I prefered don't translate nothing]).</p>  <p>The errors in this example project are of this kind:</p>  <ul> <li>error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol</li> <li>fatal error LNK1120: unresolved externals</li> </ul>  <p>The most of them are caused by the miss of OpenCV2.1, that I don't want to install, because I'll have to use it on a program using with OpenCV 3.0.0.</p>  <p>In the example project folder there are:</p>  <ol> <li>The upper mentioned .dll</li> <li>A .lib file</li> <li>The header file .h</li> <li>These DLLs: cv210.dll, cxcore210.dll, highgui210.dll, ...(eg. cv210d.dll)</li> </ol>  <p>What I've done is this:</p>  <ul> <li>A folder called "lib" where I insert all .dll, .lib, .h files.</li> <li>Put the "lib" folder in Project <code>properties&gt;linker&gt; General&gt; Additional Library Directories</code></li> <li>Writing the .lib file in <code>properties&gt;linker&gt; Input&gt; Additional Dependencies</code></li> <li>Put the 'lib' path<code>properties&gt;C/C++&gt;Additional Include Directories</code>[I know, this has no sense too]</li> </ul>  <p>I get these kind of errors:</p>  <ul> <li>error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol</li> </ul>  <p>I've tried <code>#pragma comment(lib, 'file.lib')</code> way too.</p>  <p>Someone can help me?</p>
