<p>I am using the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9abe329c-9bba-44a1-be59-0fbf6151054d?tduid=%28181dd8be52eb4dd22854eff895511f8d%29%28256380%29%282459594%29%28TnL5HPStwNw-T7w8JHsTzGi9oLfNYwCkmw%29%28%29" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Installer Addon</a> in VS2013 to generate an MSI. Everything works well, except a nuget dependency that I have is not picked up. I can manually add the <code>dll</code> to the MSI file list but then it is referred to as an absolute path and will break if I change my platform or deployment version. Is there a standard way of bundling Nuget libraries as part of Windows Installer packages? Is there any way that I can refer to the nuget package as a dependency rather than specific file assets? I have tried to use ISLE but have had the same problems there.</p>
