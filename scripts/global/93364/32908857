<p>While building my solution in VS 2013 I frequently get the following error in one or more projects:</p>  <pre><code>Files has invalid value "�q�k=#4�ij�4�[i.x��w��zg </code></pre>  <p>I performed a search on my solution directory and found that the culprit was the FileListAbsolute.txt file in the obj directory for the offending projects.</p>  <p>Deleting the obj directories temporarily solves the issue but it returns a few build later.</p>  <p>The contents of the file are sometimes complete garbage, other times it is perhaps 50% garbage - 50% valid file paths.</p>  <p>Any ideas what could be causing the FileListAbsolute to corrupt.</p>  <p>This started happening after moving the source to a new TFS collection and opening the solution using VS 2013. (It was previously a VS 2012 solution)</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> The FileListAbsolute.txt files are not in source control.</p>
