<p>I have a code snippet <code>string.Format(@"")</code> with a shortcut <code>sf</code> that inserts the snippet and places the cursor in between the two double quotes.  Really convenient.  I can normally use it, of course, by just typing <code>sf</code> and hitting tab twice:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Avl6g.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Avl6g.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However, I've just discovered that the shortcut doesn't work in all locations.  For example, if I'm building this statement:</p>  <pre><code>if(true) throw new FormatException() // &lt;-- cursor is inside these parens </code></pre>  <p>and I hit <code>sf</code>, the shortcut does not appear in the intellisense menu, and if I hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> twice, it doesn't generate the snippet.  Why?</p>  <p>I have tried searching for "C# code snippet shortcut sometimes doesn't work", "C# code snippet shortcut doesn't work", "visual studio code snippet sometimes doesn't work" among others, and I can't find anything useful about it.</p>
