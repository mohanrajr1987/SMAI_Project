<p>I have both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 installed on the same machine (but I work mostly on 2013 right now). Usually I have many (3-6) instances of VS opened in the same time.</p>  <p>Many times during a day a random instance of VS just freezes. I can bring its window but I cannot do anything inside it. What's interesting is that some parts of VS are still alive (i.e. "Diagnostic Tools" was still working). It often happens after a while of inactivity but sometimes even during the debugging or after closing some modal window. It happens both in 2013 and in 2015.</p>  <p>Can you suggest how to debug this? I cannot see anything in the event log, I tried to do <code>devenv.exe /ResetSettings</code> but it didn't help. I have many extensions installed (including ReSharper) so I would prefer to avoid disabling them one by one as this would take some timeâ€¦</p>  <p>I am using VS 2013 Premium Update 5 and VS 2015 Enterprise.</p>
