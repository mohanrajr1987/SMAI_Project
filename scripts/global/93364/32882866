<p>I am currently updating a VB.NET application with Visual Studio 2013 that possibly was originally created on VS2010 or VS2012.</p>  <p>This application uses a Network SQL Database </p>  <p>Everything goes fine up to the point of installing when just shows an error message. that says the Assembly 'Microsoft.VisualBasic.Shell.9.0' version 2.0.0.0 is required and then will not let me finish the installation.</p>  <p>The project has been exported using the Visual Basic tool [OneClick]</p>  <p>I have already checked the References list on the Project menu, and is not included there. Also not available to be added.</p>  <p>The project requires the Microsoft Framework 4.5, so it seems that the Shell v2.0.0.0 is pretty old...</p>  <p>Do you have any suggestions, this kept me scratching my head already quite a while...</p>
