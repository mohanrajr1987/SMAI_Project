<p>I would like to improve my application's interface. Is it possible to add something like this(refer to image below)?:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XCm3E.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XCm3E.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When you click the name or move the cursor to the name, a pop up box will appear with user's main info. If possible, can you teach me the appropriate tools to use. I don't mind if it is basic tools, so i can make a little similar to the image.</p>  <p>BTW, i'm using visual studio 2013.</p>
