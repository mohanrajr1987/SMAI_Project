<p>Hi I need to move my source code from one my existing TFS server to a new TFS server that is a clone of my existing one. From what I remember I think both servers are 2012 and I am using Visual Studio 2013 for development.</p>  <p>The clone already has my project on it, but it is an old version of the code. The existing server has the latest code but will be decommissioned soon.</p>  <p>Without having admin access on either server how can I move my code from the existing server with the latest code to the new server with an old version of the code.</p>  <p>Is it possible to do this and maintain the project history including the last month of development, or will I only be able to keep the code ? TFS is a managed service for me and I don't have the option to stay on the existing server.</p>  <p>I have only seen solutions where the new TFS server is clean. </p>
