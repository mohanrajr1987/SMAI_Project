<p>When Test.edmx, Test.context.tt, &amp; Test.tt were all together, I was able to update edmx from db with no issues.</p>  <p>After separating Test.tt class from EDMX &amp; moving it to a new project where all the POCO classes reside, I started seeing the below exception when trying to update edmx.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An exception of type 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException' occurred while attempting to update from the database. The exception message is: 'A file or folder with the name 'Test.Context.tt' already exists. Please give a unique name to the item you are adding, or delete the existing item first.'.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Environment</strong></p>  <p>Visual Studio 2013 with Update 5</p>  <p>Entity Framework 6.1.3</p>  <p>.NET Framework 4.5.1</p>  <p>Console Application &amp; a Class Library.</p>
