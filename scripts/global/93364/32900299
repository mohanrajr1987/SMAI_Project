<p>I have a new website that I built with vb.net.  Using Installshield setup and then deployment, all folders are preserved (app_code and others) in InetPub. And the website works great 'as installed'.  </p>  <p>I 'sucked in' 4 other websites [into the same solution] that  were created with VWD.  I got them all working and tested in debug mode no problem.  So - all code works using debug with VS.</p>  <p>NOW - In the Installshield project... When I put the 4 other websites 'content files' into the IISROOTFOLDER/websitename folder, none of their folders are preserved (app_code, app_data, bin, etc).  Just puts them all into the folder with no directory structure when deployed.</p>  <p>How can I preserve the folder structure for the 4 websites such that when I install, those websites work?</p>
