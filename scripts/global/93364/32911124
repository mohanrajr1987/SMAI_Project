<p>I have a project that I built using VS 2010 and have published it a thousand times using VS 2010 with no problems.<br> I installed VS 2013 yesterday and loaded the project and it loaded fine.  I tried to publish it the way that I normally do (FTP) and I get several errors...<br> "Passive Mode" is checked in the "Publish Web Modal".  I have searched google and haven'nt found a solution. </p>  <p>My host is Godaddy.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p><strong>Here are a few of the errors that are viewable in the output tab....</strong></p>  <p>Publishing folder assets/global/plugins/amcharts/amcharts/patterns/white...</p>  <p>Publishing folder assets/global/plugins/amcharts/ammap/maps...</p>  <p>Publishing folder assets/global/plugins/amcharts/ammap/maps/js...</p>  <p>Unable to add 'assets/global/plugins/amcharts/ammap/maps/js/colombiaLow.js' to the Web site.
