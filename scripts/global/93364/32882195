<p>I've very strange problem with Visual Studio 2013. Visual Studio Team Explorer shows some files in included changes list, but git from command line shows "nothing to commit, working directory clean". State of file in VS Team Explorer is "edit". Git version is 2.6, but in 1.9.5 the same problem occurs. Does anyone have similar problem?</p>  <p>EDIT: problem occurs when creating new file in solution from Visual Studio, new file is committed from command line (PowerShell). </p>
