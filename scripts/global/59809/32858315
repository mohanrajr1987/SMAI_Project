<p>I have recently implemented the <a href="https://github.com/emilsjolander/StickyListHeaders" rel="nofollow">StickyListHeadersListview</a> library from github. Then I used MultiChoiceModeListener for selecting items and then to copy or delete those selected elements as seen below</p>  <p>I don't want the section headers (date field) to get highlighted. Is there any way to disable this behaviour.</p>  <p>This question originated from my last unanswered question. Refer the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32781326/stickylistheaderslistview-multichoicemode-issue">link</a> for custom array adapter code</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7JMau.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7JMau.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
