<p>I'm an android beginner, so I need some help. </p>  <p>Right now I'm developing an app in where on an Activity, I create several buttons, all of them represents a different item, for example: apples, pears, etc. When I click or press one of those buttons I need that an item, that is represented for the button, will be added in other Activity on a ListView. At the end, the activity shows me all of the items added on the listview.</p>  <p>For now, I only have two java classes and two xml files.</p>  <p>One of the xml files, contains the ListView and the other the buttons.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
