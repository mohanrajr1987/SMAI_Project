<p>I have several <code>ArrayLists</code> that are going into the <code>ListView</code> adapter. What I'm trying to do is sort by just one of those <code>ArrayLists</code>...</p>  <pre><code>    names = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();     locations = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();     timedates = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();      //arraylists populated here      adapter = new HomeAdapter(getActivity(), names, locations, timedates);     setListAdapter(adapter); </code></pre>  <p>How would I go about sorting the entire <code>ListView</code> by <code>timedates</code> for example? </p>  <p>Appreciate any help. Thanks!</p>
