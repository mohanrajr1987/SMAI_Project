<p>I've got a problem with updating ListView with AsyncTask. </p>  <p>I use ViewHolders to improve performance, but they are causing problems with AsyncTask. As official android website says passing viewholder to asynctask is not a bad idea (<a href="http://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/smooth-scrolling.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/smooth-scrolling.html</a>) but in this case, when AsyncTask lasts long enough it updates two items at once with the same value. </p>  <p>I have an impression, that certain viewholder is used again 4-5 items further, and when asynctask does not finish work before passing again the same viewholder bug happens. After a while this viewholder is updating again and have correct value, but it's not satisfying me.</p>  <p>Is my way of thinking right? How to prevent this?</p>
