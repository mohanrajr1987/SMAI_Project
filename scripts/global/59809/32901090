<p>I'm creating an app that has 15 items in a list, and I need to show them one by one with an effect for each one, without user touch (for example - in a " 1,2,3" list, I will see 1 first, then 2 comes in with fade effect and I can see 1 and 2,and then 3 come in with fade effect and I can see the whole list..) </p>  <p>And another connected question, when I will be able to do that, how can I swipe the screen programmatically when the list is too big for the screen?</p>
