<p>So, I have two activities. In the first one, I have a list where I put some data and a button for going to the second activity. In the second one, I have two EditTexts and a button (save button). When I introduce some data in the EditTexts, I save the data in the first activity (list). When I choose an item of the list, I can go to the second activity and modify the content of the item. So, I display the list with the data introduced, but I don't know how save the new data after I edit again the EditTexts. I use onItemClick for choosing an item of the list. I know that I have to pass the position and the data to the second activity, I have to retrieve in the second activity and after that I have to send again to the first activity the new data changed for an item position. An idea please for doing this ?</p>  <p>Thank you !</p>
