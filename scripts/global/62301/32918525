<p>sorry this might be a very silly question but I cannot figure it out. So I am using express-handlebars and I want to name my file newpage.handlebars. But it keeps on saving as a text file. However, I want it to be a HTML extension but the name to be newpage.handlebrs. I have my friends file where he did exactly that but he is away so I can't really ask him. Here is a picture of what he did and what I am doing.His file is mypage.handlebars while mine in newpage.handlebars. How should I fix this. Thanks a lot!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J9z5m.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J9z5m.png" alt="file view"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X1CaY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X1CaY.png" alt="properties"></a></p>
