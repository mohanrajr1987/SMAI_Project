<p>I'm new to NodeJS. I am developing a REST API and using express-session to deal with sessions. So, to get the session ID I'm using</p>  <p><code>var sessionID = req.sessionID</code>   </p>  <p>This sessionID is generated from the server side. So, when I scale up to two or more servers, this is a problem. For example, if one server shuts down and the request is redirected to another server (Assuming I have a load balancer), a new session ID is generated. So, is there a way to retrieve the session ID from the client side?</p>
