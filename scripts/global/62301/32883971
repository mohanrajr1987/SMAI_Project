<p>I serve a SPA over an office webserver (node.js+express), but these static files doesn't came from a static public folder. The webserver gets signal from another server, that new a new client is downloadable. The office server get the archive and extracts it to a new folder (name: client/clientxxxxx.zip_content/). All new connections should use the new folder, but the old ones have to use the version they used at the first connection.</p>  <p>I think I have a problem with the identification of the same user/connection, because the SPA will be stateless and I can't change the statice files. PHP has an automatic for the session (id in cookie or as get variable). Is there something for express? And how to serve all files from different main folders?</p>  <p><strong>My simple solution:</strong></p>  <p>A test with a HTML and an image in a subfolder, it works with <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session" rel="nofollow">express-session</a> (Thx Alex) and a simple <code>sendFile</code>.</p>  <pre><code>app.use(session({     genid: function(req) {         return uuid.v4();     },     cookie: {         path: '/',         httpOnly: true,         secure: false,         maxAge: null     },     resave: true,     saveUninitialized: true,     secret: 'this is not a secret' })); app.get(['/','/:path*'], function (req, res, next) {     req.session.clientPath = req.session.clientPath || path.join(main.paths.client, main.versions.client + '_content');     var clientFile = path.normalize(path.join(req.session.clientPath, req.path === '/' ? '/index.html' : req.path));     if (clientFile.indexOf(main.paths.client) === 0 &amp;&amp; fs.existsSync(clientFile)) {         res.sendFile(clientFile);     } else {         res.status(404).send('Not found');     } }); </code></pre>
