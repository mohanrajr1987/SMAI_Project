<p>It seems like v.3 as it does not support the Request v4 API (req.params.key vs. re.param('key')) but does anybody really know the version?</p>  <pre><code>// let's say we call /?test=Hello  var express = require('express'); var app = express();  app.get('/', function (req, res) {    // the express v3 way: req.param()   res.send('Your Test-Parameter: ' + req.param('test'));    // In express v4 you would be able to do something like this to access a GET parameter   res.send('Your Test-Parameter: ' + req.params.test ); }); </code></pre>  <p>As far as I know the only way to find out is the package.json but it's not available in cloud code.</p>
