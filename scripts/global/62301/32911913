<hr>  <p>While looking at the potential use cases for JQuery Deferred Promises, I came across Caching as one of the potential uses. That brought about the following question: While using modern browsers and smart clients (Jquery, any modern MVC, etc.,) do I even have to worry about caching anything myself? I am working with MEAN stack and I am under the impression that caching does happen by default.  There is an Etag field in the headers that ensures that the server doesn't send the same information twice. The 2nd time, client will get 304 code with empty response body.  So are there any use cases out there requiring to manually implement caching on the front end?  Thanks!</p>
