<p>I am confused about using Etag with Express 4. My understanding was that if you do this:</p>  <pre><code>app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'), {     etag: true,      maxAge:60000 })); </code></pre>  <p>then the browser will cache assets for 60 seconds, which means that if you as the developer make a change to a static asset on the filesystem in development, then the browser won't pick up the change if you refresh until the Etag expires?</p>  <p>doesn't that mean that we should disable Etags in development, or are my assumptions incorrect?</p>
