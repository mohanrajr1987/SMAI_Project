<p>Im using Express 4.X and node js 0.12.</p>  <p>One of my routes is for file uploading and processing and for some of the files the upload and process takes more than the 2 minutes default timeout. I have tried to settimeout to values more than 2 minutes but its just not working, the server closes connection exactly after 2 minutes every time.</p>  <pre><code>server.timeout = 60 * 60 * 1000; // still closes after 2 minutes server.on('connection', function(socket) {   socket.setTimeout(700 * 1000); // still closes after 2 minutes });  res.setTimeout(0);// still closes after 2 minutes req.setTimeout(0);// still closes after 2 minutes res.connection.setTimeout(0);// still closes after 2 minutes </code></pre>  <p>The connect-timeout middleware is not helped either, it just keeps closing the connection after exactly 2 minutes. Tried changing the node version to older version but with no success. Tried all the variations found online, but the connection still closes...</p>
