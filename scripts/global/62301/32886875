<p>I have built a webapplication serving under nodejs. The nodejs has different paths to a "rest"-api. It also serves the webpage.</p>  <p>For example</p>  <pre><code>app.get('/support/user', function (res,req){...}); app.post('/support/user/edit', function (res,req){...}); app.post('/support/user/create', function (res,req){...}); app.get('/support/download', function (res,req){...}); </code></pre>  <p>In my <code>sites-available/</code> folder, I have a file called <code>my.domain.com</code>, where I have a lot of different web services.</p>  <p>I added these lines there:</p>  <pre><code>ProxyPass /support http://127.0.0.1:9093/     ProxyPassReverse /support http://127.0.0.1:9093/ RewriteRule ^/$ /support [R,L] </code></pre>  <p>My node.js server runs on <code>localhost:9093</code></p>  <p>I can access my website, and show all the HTML files, but <strong>none</strong> of the different get and post requests reaches nodejs. For example, my Angular services calls: <code>'/support/user'</code>, In my network tab I can see that it tries to reach: <code>https://my.domain.se/support/support/opensource</code> but my browser prints out: <code>Cannot GET //support/opensource</code> (note the double slash before support).</p>  <p>I have no idea whats going on. Why can't I access the other paths? Do I need to open everyone of them in the sites-available file?</p>
