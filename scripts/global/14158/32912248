<p>I'm pretty new to SSL and Azure, so I have a couple questions.</p>  <p>I created a new SSL certificate and uploaded the .CSR to Azure, and the status says the certificate has been created, and I see the new expiration date and new thumbprint, etc, for that cert. However, when I go to my site and check the certificate status, the from/to dates of the old certificate dates are still listed. I uploaded this certificate a little early, and the end date of the current cert is 10/30/2015, so on 10/30, will I see the new expiration date or should I see it now?</p>  <p>The second question might be an indicator of something wrong on my part when I uploaded the new certificate to Azure. The existing cert, which expires on 10/30/2015, shows "CN=www.mysite.com, OU=Domain Control Validated, O=www.mysite.com", whereas the new certificate shows all the parameters but the "O=www.mysite.com" parameter. What does this third parameter indicate?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Ben</p>
