<p>I would like to convert an existing Azure Website to a web role.  I am running Visual Studio 2015 with the Azure SDK 2.7.1.</p>  <p>According to other answers, and this web page: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh420322.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh420322.aspx</a>, there should be a "<code>Convert</code>" menu item in the web project's context menu, but I can't such an item.  Has it been discontinued, moved or replaced?</p>
