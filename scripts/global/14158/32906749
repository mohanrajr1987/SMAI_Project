<p>It is possible to delete azure app hosting plan to stop being charged, but I am wondering if it's possible to disable it somehow. If you delete it, then you lose configuration, etc. But I did not find any options to kind of turn it off, and then put it back online (I suppose it's possible with virtual machines e.g.), or reduce the instance count to 0 somehow. Did someone find a way to do it?</p>  <p>P.S. Sometimes it's possible to switch to free plan, but e.g. it won't work when you have deployment slots, etc.</p>
