<p>So I have a list of about 3 million pre constructed queries I want to send to my Azure Table and then use the results for data analysis, I am using the Azure SDK and sending single queries like this: </p>  <pre><code>TableQuery&lt;MyEntity&gt; query = new TableQuery&lt;MyEntity&gt;().Where(queryString); MyEntity entity = table.ExecuteQuery(query).ElementAt(0); entities.Add(entity); </code></pre>  <p>I was thinking of parallelizing the queries in order to increase my speed because right now its taking multiple hours to complete all 3 million queries. I am very new to C# and Azure so I wanted to know what the best way of doing this Parallelization would be? Thanks in advance!</p>
