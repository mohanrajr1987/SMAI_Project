<p>I am planning to deploy a VS2015 web project to azure web app environment. I need to implement access to app settings. In azure deployment mode it is easy to access settings made via the azure portal. What is the best place to store these settings in my VS development environment to access with the same code in development mode local settings and in deployment mode azure settings. Placing settings in APP.CONFIG is no option, as this file is deployed to azure to. Thx for help.</p>
