<p>I've just created a "new" virtual machine in Windows Azure. I say "new" because there is a "Virtual Machine (classic)" option.</p>  <p>The "new" virtual machine is not accesible by the "old" <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com" rel="nofollow">https://manage.windowsazure.com</a>, it's only accesible by the "new" <a href="https://portal.azure.com" rel="nofollow">https://portal.azure.com</a></p>  <p>My problem is that I've expent a couple of days configuring the "new" Virtual Machine and now I want to open the port 80... but I don't find the "endpoint" configuration!!</p>  <p>I've been looking for it many hours :S</p>  <p>Any clues?</p>
