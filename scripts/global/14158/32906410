<p>I downgraded my dependency on Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage from 5.0.2 to 4.3 but my Console Application still attempts to load the   5.0.2 version of the library. I am using NuGet, VS 2015. I have Microsoft Azure Libraries 2.7 installed ony my computer. I was able to confirm that all my compiled dll have a dependency on Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll v 4.3 , there aren't any reference left to the 5.0.2 version in none of .csproj. The flag SpecificVersion has been set to True for all the references.</p>  <p>My question is: Is there some sort of cache that would need to be cleared? The FileNotFound exception is raised the first time I access a symbol defined in Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll (CloudStorageAccount)</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
