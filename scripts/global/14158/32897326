<p>I'm working on creating a build pipeline that to compile an ApiWebApp and deploy it to Azure from Visual Studio Online. My build flow is:</p>  <ul> <li>Visual Studio Build</li> <li>Publish Build Artifacts</li> <li>Azure Web App Deployments</li> </ul>  <p>My questions are:</p>  <ul> <li>Is it reasonable to deploy an API App from Visual Studio Online to Azure?  Hoping the answer to this is yes.</li> <li>Do I have the right steps in my pipeline?</li> <li>In the Azure Web App Deployments step, what should I enter for the 'Web Deploy Package' ?</li> </ul>  <p>Regards, Rajesh</p>
