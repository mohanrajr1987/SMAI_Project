<p>I have looked at the question asked here:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7027656/friendly-filename-when-public-download-azure-blob">Friendly filename when public download Azure blob</a> I am a total azure noob and wouldn't have a clue how to implement any of the answers except this one which looks like something I could handle:</p>  <pre><code>string sasBlobToken = blob.GetSharedAccessSignature(sharedPolicy, new SharedAccessBlobHeaders()         {             ContentDisposition = "attachment; filename=" + friendlyFileName         });   string downloadLink = blob.Uri + sasBlobToken; </code></pre>  <p>My question is how to set the 'sharedpolicy variable correctly?  I tried just making a blank one on the line above:</p>  <pre><code>SharedAccessBlobPolicy sharedpolicy = new SharedAccessBlobPolicy(); </code></pre>  <p>But I get a permission denied message when clicking the download link. So my question is how to set the sharedpolicy variable correctly?</p>
