<p>There are two folders in the solution folder(but not added to solution) which I want to copy to approot of that worker role. These folder contains dlls and other files which I do not want to include in the solution and mark them as "Content".</p>  <p>I'm using Azure 2.4 SDK. I read about <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/gg557553#Contents" rel="nofollow">content element</a> on msdn and tried to use content element to achieve this. Something like below:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Contents&gt;   &lt;Content destination="\EnterpriseLibraries_5_0"&gt;     &lt;SourceDirectory path="..\..\EnterpriseLibraries\EnterpriseLibraries_5_0\" /&gt;        &lt;/Content&gt;   &lt;Content destination="\EnterpriseLibraries_6_0"&gt;     &lt;SourceDirectory path="..\..\EnterpriseLibraries\EnterpriseLibraries_6_0" /&gt;   &lt;/Content&gt; &lt;/Contents&gt;     </code></pre>  <p>However it fails in finding source directory each time. I'm stuck in creating relative path for these folders. </p>  <p>As a second approach, I xcopied these folder contents as post build activity into $Outdir. But postbuild events do not have effect on what's get copied to approot.</p>  <p>Please suggest way of achieving this external content copy to approot using relative path.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Adding physical path to source directory in the content element works beautifully. However I'm unable to create relative path, can't figure out how "relative path" is "relative" to which folder.</p>  <p>Back to relative path issues: It seems like base path for the relative keeps changing. It starts from \\bin\debug sometimes, if I create relative path taking this base path during next build somehow \ becomes base path.</p>  <p>I keep getting error likes during build for path:</p>  <p>Try 1: ServiceDefinition.csdef(0,0): error CloudServices089: Cannot find the source directory 'D:\a\b\c\d\aa\aa\bin\Debug....\ExternalLib\EnterpriseLibraries_5_0\' in role WCFWorker.</p>  <p>Try 2: ServiceDefinition.csdef(0,0): error CloudServices089: Cannot find the source directory 'D:\a\b\c\d\aa\aa........\ExternalLib\EnterpriseLibraries_5_0\' in role WCFWorker.    </p>
