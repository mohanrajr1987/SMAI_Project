<p>My website is running under <code>LAMP</code> environment on windows azure. Website is taking too much time to load. And sometimes it just opens very quickly. I tried to debug it from <code>slow_query_log</code> in <code>mysql</code>. Everything looks ok there as it's intermittent issue. I am 99% sure that it's not server side issue.</p>  <p>I also tried with frontend monitoring by below script:</p>  <pre><code>// When the DOM is loaded $(function(){     console.log('Start ' + new Date().getTime()); }); // When all the images are loaded $(window).load(function(){     console.log('End ' + new Date().getTime()); }); </code></pre>  <p>Result:</p>  <pre><code>Start 1443799367774 End 1443799368096 </code></pre>  <p>I couldn't figure it out what's wrong here. Please advice me how can I debug more deeply or is there any solution to overcome this problem. Thanks.</p>
