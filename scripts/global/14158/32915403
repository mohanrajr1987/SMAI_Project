<p>In my asp.net page I'm trying to....</p>  <ol> <li>Create a temp datatable and fill it with data (this works)</li> <li>Do a bulkCopy ColumnMappings on the columns to the destination table</li> <li>Do a bulkCopy.WriteToServer from the temp datatable to the destination table</li> </ol>  <p>The destination table is in an Azure db.</p>  <p>Everything works until I try the WriteToServer, at which time I get this error:</p>  <p>"Tables without a clustered index are not supported in this version of SQL Server. Please create a clustered index and try again."</p>  <p>My temp table and Azure destination table does have a PK. Any suggestions?</p>
