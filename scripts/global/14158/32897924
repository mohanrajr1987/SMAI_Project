<p>I am uploading files to an Azure Storage container and need to set the caching rules. Essentially, I want browsers to cache it forever (or as long as the browser chooses).</p>  <p>I'm looking at x_ms_blob_cache_control from here:</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ee691966.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ee691966.aspx</a></p>  <p>However, they don't say what format the value should have. I have tried</p>  <pre><code>"max-age:31536000" "max-age=31536000" </code></pre>  <p>I'm uploading via Python:</p>  <pre><code>import azure from azure.storage.blob import BlobService  blob_service.put_block_blob_from_path(         container_name = container_name,         blob_name = blob_name ,         file_path = file_path ,         x_ms_blob_content_type = mime_type,         x_ms_blob_cache_control = "WHAT GOES HERE?"     ) </code></pre>  <p>The image is downloaded every time I enter its url in my browser to view it.</p>
