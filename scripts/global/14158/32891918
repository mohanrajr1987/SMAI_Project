<p>I have a node server deployed to azure and am using Edge.js to make some WCF calls. When I host the server locally, everything works great because I can put the .NET config for the web service calls in node.exe.config located next to my local node.exe as recommended <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17170174/load-wcf-app-config-bindings-in-edge-js-app/23480481#23480481">here</a>.</p>  <p>However, this does not seem feasible for a node server hosted on azure. Azure doesn't seem to let user arbitrarily put files on their file systems on whatever machine the user's server happens to be currently running on (which is completely reasonable). Is there a way I can tell edge or node to look for the config in a different location?</p>
