<p>I'd like to start using the Power BI REST API to update data.</p>  <p>Is it possible to get an authentication token without prompting a user for their credentials ?  My application is a Windows Service that runs on a server.  </p>  <p>The examples I've seen so far seem to require a user to supply their AAD credentials in order to get a token.</p>  <p>Is it possible to call the API from an unattended process?  If so, any examples you guys know about.  Thanks </p>
