<p>I have an odd issue...I have four Azure VMs in the same cloud service (load balanced web servers):</p>  <ul> <li>WEBSERVER1</li> <li>WEBSERVER2</li> <li>WEBSERVER3</li> <li>WEBSERVER4</li> </ul>  <p>WEBSERVER1 and WEBSERVER2 seem to start without issue, but they're almost always running. </p>  <p>If I start WEBSERVER3, it starts without issue.</p>  <p>If I then start WEBSERVER4, I get the following error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The server encountered an internal error. Please retry the request.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I stop WEBSERVER3, I can then start WEBSERVER4, but if I try to start WEBSERVER3, I get the same error. Of course, that persists until I shut WEBSERVER4 down...</p>  <p>Any ideas what's going on? I don't have a support plan on this subscription and it seems a little ridiculous that I can't get support from Azure for something related to their own infrastructure so I figured I'd give SO a shot.</p>
