<p>I'm attempting to pull data from the Azure Service Management API using certificate authentication. I'm using a .cer and .pfx file pair that I have confirmed work in other scenarios. I've uploaded the .cer to Azure Management Certificates and imported the .pfx to my Current User/Personal store. I have a GetX509Certificate(string thumbprint) method that I can see working in the debugger. I'm creating the web request with this code:</p>  <pre><code>    private static HttpWebRequest CreateHttpWebRequest(Uri uri, X509Certificate2 certificate, String httpWebRequestMethod)     {         HttpWebRequest httpWebRequest = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(uri);         httpWebRequest.Method = httpWebRequestMethod;         httpWebRequest.Headers.Add("x-ms-version", versionNumber);         httpWebRequest.ClientCertificates.Add(certificate);         httpWebRequest.ContentType = "application/xml";          return httpWebRequest;     } </code></pre>  <p>I've confirmed the correct certificate is being added to the web request, but I'm getting <strong>403 Forbidden:</strong> The server failed to authenticate the request. Verify that the certificate is valid and is associated with this subscription.</p>  <p>I know that the URL I'm accessing is correct as I can switch to using AD Authentication and it works immediately, but that isn't viable for my use case. </p>  <p>Does anyone have a thought as to what could be missing?</p>
