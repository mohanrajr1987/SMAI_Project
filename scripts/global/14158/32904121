<p>I'm beginning to start using Azure and have a published mvc website. I need to deploy a newer version of a website and want to create a back up of the published web app just in case if new deployment breaks I can roll back from the back up. From what I have learned I need to create a storage account to create and retrieve back ups. Not sure what kind of storage this back up will require i.e. a blob, queue,table file etc and also looking for a walk-through how the backups can be done for web apps and retrieved? Any ideas? </p>
