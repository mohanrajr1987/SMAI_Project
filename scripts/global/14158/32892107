<p>In adding the locators to several files I uploaded to azure media service, I mistakenly, added and set the wrong expiration time on the mp4 files.  I am also storing the information for each uploaded file in the database, including the links to the locator.  Is there a way I can reset the expiration time on the locators for each file I currently have stored in media services and be able to retrieve the new locators for each file?</p>
