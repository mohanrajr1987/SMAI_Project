<p>I registered my app at <a href="https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/</a>. 1- I am trying to access calendar rest api. To perform the oauth2, i need the client secret. I can't seem to find the client secret. There is the option for password or private key but using both of those throws an error. Can you please tell me where to find the client secret?</p>  <p>2- There are multiple documents talking about multiple ways of registering an app. Should i register my app at <a href="https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/</a> which using the following end point or authorization: <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize" rel="nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize</a>?</p>  <p>or the make an account on Azure AD and use the following end point: <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize" rel="nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize</a>?</p>
