<p>So I'm considering using an Azure VM to work with a consulting firm that is working on an application for me and have some basic security questions before going much further. I've been watching some tutorial videos on azure, but still not sure about security and access in general.  </p>  <p>How is access to a VM on Azure controlled?  Windows Authentication, https ? I've seen examples of connecting to a SQL Azure instance with SSMS, how is that secured?</p>  <p>I think I still need to read more...</p>  <p>The target for production is our own server, but we want to use Azure so that the consulting firm can have a development build target that we can see the published changes on.</p>  <p>If we do this, will the code have to change much to be deployed on one of our own servers outside of the Azure environment?  </p>
