<p>What is the difference between these two portals and why? And when should I use which of them?</p>  <p>For example: When I want to configure if/which Java version I want to use in a WebApp, in the "manage"-portal I only can choose between <em>off</em> and <em>v1.7.0_51</em>. In the "portal"-portal I can choose between <em>off</em>, <em>v7</em> and <em>v8</em>.  <br>Or, if I want to create a new Ubuntu-VM, in the "manage"-portal I can choose between <em>v12.04</em>, <em>v14.04</em> and <em>v15.04</em>. In the "portal"-portal there is only <em>v14.04</em>.</p>
