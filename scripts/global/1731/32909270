<p>I'm using cygwin and every time I call on heroku, it outputs what looks like the help return of msql twice, then works as normal: </p>  <pre><code>    Kenneth@Forge ~ $ heroku     MySQL  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.41, for CYGWIN (x86_64) using readline 6.3     Copyright (c) 2000, 2014, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

One doesn't need to use                           'rehash' to get table and field completion, but startup                           and reconnecting may take a longer time. Disable with                           --disable-auto-rehash.                           (Defaults to on; use --skip-auto-rehash to disable.)       -A, --no-auto-rehash                           No automatic rehashing. One has to use 'rehash' to get                           table and field completion. This gives a quicker start of                           mysql and disables rehashing on reconnect. </code></pre>  <p>... and so on, ending with ...</p>  <pre><code>    secure-auth                       FALSE     show-warnings                     FALSE     plugin-dir                        (No default value)     default-auth                      (No default value) </code></pre>  <p>then repeating the same as above, then working as normal. Hours of searching has yielded nothing, nor has uninstalling and reinstalling heroku. I tried to look in the heroku files to find out what's doing this, but I'm pretty far out of my depth. Any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
