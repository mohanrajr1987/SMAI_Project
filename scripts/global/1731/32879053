<p>I am trying to use Cygwin to run my first python program. I downloaded python and Cygwin. Within the Cygwin terminal I ran the command: "which python" to confirm that the terminal could find python. However when I attempt to cd into my Desktop for example, I get "-bash: cd: Desktop: No such file or directory". When I try to do an ls, it simply returns an empty line. For some reason "pwd" works normally. </p>  <p>I am having a problem similar to the one here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14797194/cygwin-ls-command-not-found">Cygwin ls command not found</a></p>  <p>However changing the environmental variables has no effect (even after I closed and repopened the terminal window).  </p>
