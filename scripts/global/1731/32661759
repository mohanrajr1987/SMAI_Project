<p>I tried to build the mpg123 as a static lib with the following config:</p>  <pre><code>./configure --enable-static --enable-debug=false --with-cpu=x86-64 --with-optimization=4 --disable-shared --with-default-audio=dummy </code></pre>  <p>What should I add (or change) to get the libmpg123.a (libmpg123.lib)? If somebody is willing to share how to select x86 vs x64 with several optimization options for each build, I would appreciate it a lot!</p>  <p>Edit: I noticed one more problem after running the 'configure':</p>  <pre><code>checking build system type...x86_64-unknown-cygwin checking host system type... x86_64-unknown-cygwin </code></pre>
