<p>I am using two laptops (OS X and Windows10) at a Starbucks and want to transfer a file from one to the other without using a USB flashdrive.  It is a large file so I don't want to send it over the internet, rather I want to use the local network.  How can I set up an SSH over LAN?  Is this possible at a public network like at Starbucks or do I need to control port forwarding on the router level etc?</p>  <p>I set up an ssh server on the target host in cygwin and successfully can connect to it there via <code>ssh -v localhost</code>. I can also connect there using <code>ssh -v username@172.31.98.84</code> (using the local IP that I find using <code>ipconfig</code> on cygwin and reading the line titled "IPv4 Address").  However, when I try this same ssh command from the macbook client to attempt to connect to the windows host, it fails by timing out..</p>  <p>Thanks for any advice.</p>
