<p>I am following this post:</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.dotsmart.net/2011/01/27/executing-cygwin-bash-scripts-on-windows/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.dotsmart.net/2011/01/27/executing-cygwin-bash-scripts-on-windows/</a></p>  <p>I need to execute a batch file with an argument and pass this argument to a bash script. The argument is a long file name with spaces, something like FILE WITH SPACES.xlsx. </p>  <p>In Windows:</p>  <p><code>c&gt; program.cmd "FILE WITH SPACES.xlsx"</code> #Â Windows adds the quotes to complete the name of the file.</p>  <p>The batch script must pass the name of the file "FILE WITH SPACES.xlsx" to a .sh script, something like this:</p>  <pre><code># program.sh "FILE WITH SPACES.xlsx" </code></pre>  <p>Here is the problem, the file is passed without the quotes:</p>  <pre><code># program.sh FILE WITH SPACES.xlsx </code></pre>  <p>The script program.sh has:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/sh anyprogram "$1" </code></pre>  <p>The quotes are not passed and the program <code>anyprogram</code> doesn't locate the file FILE WITH SPACES.xlsx.</p>  <p>i tried escaping the " with \ but not work:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/sh anyprogram "\"$1"\" </code></pre>  <p>Also, with:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/sh anyprogram '"$1"' </code></pre>  <p>None looks to work, any suggestion?</p>
