<p>I am new to cygwin and have been using a dlcoal package, but While executing one of its commands dlcoal_recon, it shows the following error: Traceback (most recent call last):</p>  <pre><code>File "bin/dlcoal_recon", line 139, in &lt;module&gt; dlcoal.dlcoalc.srand(conf.seed) File "/usr/lib/python2.7/ctypes/__init__.py", line 378, in __getattr__ func = self.__getitem__(name) File "/usr/lib/python2.7/ctypes/__init__.py", line 383, in __getitem__ func = self._FuncPtr((name_or_ordinal, self)) AttributeError: function 'srand' not found </code></pre>  <p>Additionally, while searching I also found that the <code>srand</code> function is present in a library called <code>"stdlib.h"</code>, however this has also been installed in cygwin library, so I am really confused to how to import the <code>srand</code> function into this package.</p>
