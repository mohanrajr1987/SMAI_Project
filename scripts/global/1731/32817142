<p>I want to install Cygwin on Windows 8.1 64bit but got no success using any variant. I tried:</p>  <p>1) I downloaded fresh setup-x86_x64 from cygwin site and then tried to install from Internet but got empty mirror list.</p>  <p>2) The I tried manually add mirror from <a href="https://cygwin.com/mirrors.lst" rel="nofollow">https://cygwin.com/mirrors.lst</a> (this file accessible from my computer) but got "unable to get setup.ini" error.</p>  <p>3) then I tried to download WHOLE package manually from one of the mirrors (all mirrors normally accessible from my computer via FTP or HTTP) to setup from local package. When I downloaded all packages (about 30 Gigs) I ran setup with local package option. Package folder was scanned and I got list of categories. But there was no package in any category.</p>  <p>4) also I tried to run setup on my Windows 7 notebook. It got mirror list normally. Also I downloaded packages by setup program using my notebook, then transfered them to my Win 8.1 desktop, but the story was the same: I saw list of categories without packages. But on Win7 notebook I saw packages in categoies when I tried to install from the same directory.</p>  <p>5) Also I tried to turn off or even uninstall my firewall and antivirus software, but all results was the same.</p>  <p>6) I tried to run setup with administrator rights, tried to use different folders and HDD paths, tried to use x86 setup instead of x64 setup.</p>  <p>But nothing helped me.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
