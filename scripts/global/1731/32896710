<p>I am using ConEmu as a dropdown terminal for windows 7.  Rather than cmd, I'm using the cygwin shell.  To have ConEmu recognize cygwin, in <strong>ConEmu --> Settings --> Startup</strong>, I specified my named task to call my Cygwin.bat file.  IE, when ConEmu is launched, it calls my cygwin.bat file (under C:\Program Files\Cygwin\Cygwin.bat).  This is great because I have many custom aliases in my cygwin/home/.bash_profile file that also work in ConEmu.</p>  <p>The problem is when I open a newtab in ConEmu (I like to work with several tabs in a single window).  This is the "Create new console or new window" hotkey, which I've mapped to ctrl+T.  The new terminal loads up, but all of my custom commands in .bash_profile are lost.  In fact, it says:</p>  <pre><code>sh: cd: your_path: No such file or directory sh: cd: your_path: No such file or directory  XBBL2Q8@D151TEC004043 /cygdrive/c/Users/XBBL2Q8 $ </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't occur when I load ConEmu initially, only when I load a new tab.</p>  <p>Any ideas of why the new tab is not reading the .bash_profile?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
