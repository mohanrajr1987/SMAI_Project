<p>I'm having trouble running sublime in the background from my zsh terminal. In other words, I want to still be able to write commands in the terminal after my command is run. Here's what I have in ~/.zshrc</p>  <p><code>alias subl="C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text.exe"</code></p>  <p>In bash, I just add <code>$1 &amp;</code>. This doesn't seem to apply in zsh.</p>
