<p>I have a large csv file about 5G. i want to split it into smaller files to be imported into sqlite.</p>  <pre><code>`split -b 1G input.txt output` </code></pre>  <p>i got 6 output files from running the above code: output1-output6. the problem is that only output1 has 300K records and all other files have 0. i used the following to count lines in each file: </p>  <pre><code>`wc -l output1` </code></pre>  <p>but when i check the output file size, all of them are around 1G (except output6). What's wrong with my code or file? </p>
