<p>I understand that forking is slow on windows, but this seems even worse than expected:</p>  <pre><code>time (for i in {1..200}; do echo $i; done)  real  0m0.012s user  0m0.016s sys   0m0.000s </code></pre>  <p>vs:</p>  <pre><code>time (for i in {1..200}; do basename $i; done)  real  0m22.263s user  0m2.075s sys   0m14.180s </code></pre>  <p>that's 0.2s overhead each time I run a program, even a simple one like basename!</p>
