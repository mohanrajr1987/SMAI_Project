<p>I'm new to vim and its lots of plugins. I heard that there is a plugin called "taglist" can help to list tags in code files. Then I downloaded the taglist zip and place taglist.vim in the "plugin" folder under .vim folder in cygwin. Add some configurations in .vimrc as tutorial says. However, when I tried to open code file, it prompts<br> <strong>"Taglist: Failed to generate tags for .../main.c<br> /bin/bash: /usr/bin/ctags: No such file or directory ^@"</strong></p>  <p>Then I realized that I didn't install the ctags. So I download the ctags58 zip file, unzip the folder to some place and add its path to PATH environment variable. In cygwin, when I type "$ctags --version", it can output expected results. But, when open a code file in vim, it still prompts the above error.</p>  <p>Here I want to ask for help on this 2 topics: </p>  <ol> <li>How to install just the missing ctags in cygwin? Each time I want to install some components, I should click every items in the package list, to install or to skip, that's very time-consuming and tough!  </li> <li>If I choose not to install ctags in cygwin setup, how can I eliminate the error prompts?</li> </ol>
