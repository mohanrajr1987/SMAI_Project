<p>I installed Cygwin 1.7 on a remote machine and I am able to connect with the default user "cyg_server" and start a process via <code>cygstart</code>. </p>  <p>I would like to do exactly the same thing but with a different user. I created it in this way:  <code>mkpasswd -d DOMAIN -p /home -u USER &gt;&gt;/etc/passwd</code></p>  <p>I can connect smoothly, but when I use <code>cygstart</code> to run my target process nothing happen. From the console I don't get any message at all, but I am sure of that because after I launch <code>taskkill</code>.</p>  <p>Finally, if I connect remotely to my machine and I run the same command directly in the cygwin console I don't have any problem.</p>  <p>Any clue? Thanks</p>
