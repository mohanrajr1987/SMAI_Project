<p>I'm trying to mimic the <code>subl</code> command in iterm for mac computers in cygwin.</p>  <p>Basically, I want to be able to open a current folder from cygwin by typing <code>subl .</code></p>  <p>I haven't found any good instructions. I know where my .bashrc file is located. I just dont know what to do to create the command <code>subl</code> and make it so that the path following <code>subl</code> opens with Sublime.</p>  <p>Can anyone help? </p>
