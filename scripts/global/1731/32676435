<p>I am having some trouble getting clean pdfs from <a href="http://www.flbog.edu/about/budget/ea_reports/20112012-SUS-EAMN-RPT4.HTML" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I ended up using free software online to create a pdf <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gdyjdtwalk0ppaa/2011SUS.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">file</a> I would like to analyze. However, each pdf page has two tables, and I would like it them to have one each. </p>  <p>(In case you're wondering why I want pdfs, I am using pdf text mining software and have written the program for it, so once I have a well-formatted pdf, I should be good to go). </p>  <p>I see two possible ways to solve this: </p>  <p>1) use a different html to pdf software, but none of those readily available online work as well as the one I'm using currently. I heard about htmldoc, but I can't seem to find the package in cygwin x32, which is what I am running through. </p>  <p>2) write a script to separate the tables in the pdfs. I took a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13345593/split-each-pdf-page-in-two">this</a>, ran the python script and did not have much success. I can separate the tables, but the big problem is that the <strong>first page the pdf has different spacing than the rest.</strong> In addition, the spacing between the tables changes just a little bit every other page. I was wondering if there was any way you could separate these tables based on a character, regardless of the spacing between the tables? </p>  <p>For instance (each represents one table I would like to make a page of the pdf): </p>  <pre><code> --------------------------------      State University System           etc. etc.... 1 ---------------------------------   ---------------------------------      State University System           etc. etc.... 2 ---------------------------------     ---------------------------------      State University System           etc. etc.... 3 --------------------------------- ---------------------------------      State University System           etc. etc.... 4 --------------------------------- </code></pre>  <p>And so on and so forth. Is there any way to look for the table borders (or match the string "State University System") and then print the following table to its own pdf page?  </p>  <p>Thanks so much! </p>
