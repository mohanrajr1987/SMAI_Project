<p>I have a problem wit compilation with gcc on 32-bit cygwin.  The message is:</p>  <pre><code>C:/cygwin/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/4.9.3/cc1plus.exe: error while loading shared libraries: cygisl-10.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>And that is true. I have cygisl-13.dll instead of cygisl-10.dll. I'm not sure whether this is just more recent version of the same library or something different. </p>  <p>On the other hand I do have cygisl-10.dll but not cygisl-13.dll in cygwin64 and I'm able to compile programs.</p>  <p>Is it configuration issue or broken package database?</p>
