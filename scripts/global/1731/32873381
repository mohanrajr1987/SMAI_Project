<p>I am developing a Symfony2 web app that will be hosted on an Ubuntu server and want my directory structure to be:<br> /Symfony (with an app,bin and vendor folder in it)<br> /Site1<br> /Site2  </p>  <p>This way site1 and site2 use the same Symfony framework. In /Site1 I want: /web<br> and in there I want app.php and app_dev.php as well as /web/AppBundle with all of the bundle files. I already figured out that I need to change in app.php require_once <strong>DIR</strong>.'/../Symfony/app/AppKernel.php'; in 2 places as per <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/configuration/override_dir_structure.html" rel="nofollow">http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/configuration/override_dir_structure.html</a> </p>  <p>When I generated the bundle I did get the message "Checking that the bundle is autoloaded: FAILED" and that I should "Edit the composer.json file and register the bundle namespace in the "autoload" section" </p>  <p>I added "AppBundle": "/web/AppBundle" to the composer.json autoload section and in cygwin I run "composer -n install" It starts with saying that it is loading composer repositories and then it says "Installing dependencies (including require-dev)" and never goes past that.</p>  <p>What can I do to register this bundle that is not in the standard folder so that autoload picks it up? I am just getting the fact that the class could not be found in AppKernel.php</p>  <p>Thanks. </p>
