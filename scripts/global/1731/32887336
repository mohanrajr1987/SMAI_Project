<p>I know that others have struggled with this problem, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I have installed anything I can see related to gcc, BLAS, or LAPACK in the cygwin packages window, but I still get a long list of errors when I do <code>pip install scipy</code>. I see things like</p>  <pre><code> Running from scipy source directory.  Splitting linalg.interpolative Fortran source files  blas_opt_info:  blas_mkl_info:    libraries mkl,vml,guide not found in ['/usr/local/lib', '/usr/lib', '/usr/lib/']    NOT AVAILABLE   openblas_info:    libraries openblas not found in ['/usr/local/lib', '/usr/lib', '/usr/lib/']    NOT AVAILABLE </code></pre>  <p>The last error I see is:</p>  <pre><code>Command "/usr/bin/python -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-build-8lzrOH/scipy/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-nzff hk-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-8lzrOH/scipy </code></pre>  <p>Can someone help me out with this? Numpy is working without any problems.</p>
