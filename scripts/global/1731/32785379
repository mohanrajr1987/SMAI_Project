<p>I have been using Putty for SSH connections and it works great. Now I need to do more local command line development and I found that Putty doesnt do that. Mintty is basically the local version Putty, from what I found, but it requires Cygwin in order to work.</p>  <p>What benefit do I gain specifically from using Mintty and Cygwin instead of default Windows command prompt?</p>
