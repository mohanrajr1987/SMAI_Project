<p>While releasing a project I am getting below error in jenkins. I have multimodule project where one directory contains 5 projects and each project has its own pom.xml. I have created a 6th project to create EAR ( using 5 projects binaries) and this ear needs to be checked in repository.</p>  <p><strong>The goal you specified requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory (/dev/shm/jenkinsworkspaces/Project_EAR_Build/workspace/Project_EAR_Build/target/checkout.). Please verify you invoked Maven from the correct directory.</strong></p>  <p>I have specify goal in jenkins job as <strong>-Dresume=false release:prepare release:perform</strong>.</p>  <p>What should I mention in goal so that maven will refer <strong>checkout/EAR_Project</strong> directory to locate  pom.xml instead of checkout directory ?</p>
