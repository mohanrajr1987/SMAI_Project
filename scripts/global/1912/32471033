<p>I am using the JUnit for code coverage in my project. For db i am using the dbunit as like mock DB. When i am running JUnit from Eclipse UI its getting passed, but its getting failed when run through maven. </p>  <p>Above set up is running fine in JDK 1.6.25 by using maven and its started failing when upgraded to 1.8.51. I had updated the maven compiler plugin, its doesn't work. I am used below versions, junit - 4.7  2.dbunit - 2.4.8 hsqldb - 2.0.0 maven - 2.2.1.</p>
