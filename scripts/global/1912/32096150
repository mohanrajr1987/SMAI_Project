<p>We are in the process of upgrading our build processes and infrastructure. The majority of the projects are still stuck using Maven <code>2.2.1</code> (we have hundreds of Maven projects across a number of environment on different Hudson and Jenkins servers). An immediate upgrade to 3.3.x will most-certainly break things for us due to the number of teams affected and large amount of projects which haven't been looked after, or have become obsolete.</p>  <p>As part of the migration, we would temporarily like to disable the generation and deployment of Maven sites. In the more recent versions of the maven-site-plugin there is there are two properties that would have come quite handy - <code>maven.site.skip</code> and <code>maven.site.deploy.skip</code>, however we are unfortunately stuck Maven <code>2.2.1</code> where these versions are completely ignored.</p>  <p>Is there another way to disable this?</p>
