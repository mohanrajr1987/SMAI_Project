<p>i was trying to understand couchDB by following this example :-              </p>  <p><strong><a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/08/couchdb-relax.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/08/couchdb-relax.html</a></strong></p>  <p>all the couch db maven dependencies i have imported (which i have found on google )they <strong>do not resolve Session</strong> and <strong>document</strong></p>  <pre><code>import com.fourspaces.couchdb.Session; import com.fourspaces.couchdb.Document; </code></pre>  <p>i can always get it run using jar locally as i learned it here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4955635/how-to-add-local-jar-files-in-maven-project">How to add local jar files in maven project?</a></p>  <p>but then i have to manually copy jar(s) in my other environments (production/Testing...) .</p>  <p>I was wondering is there any work around for this ? </p>  <p>Please give me some hints or suggestions.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
