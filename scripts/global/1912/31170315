<p><strong>I got a maven project with Netbeans 8 (linux).</strong></p>  <p>My project is a maven application that I have to 'export' as a JAR runnable JAVA application. While I'm developing the system in Netbeans everything works fine with maven dependencies, but after compile and generate the .jar file in the target folder I got the error NoClassDefFoundError. In my searches through google I found that this problem is caused when I have the dependencies in development environment but not when it's compiled with classpath.</p>  <p>One solution is to include dependencies jar as library in project, but with this I lost maven functionality. I don't wanna make it, just in last case.</p>  <p>How can I solve this problem without add dependencies as library inside project?</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
