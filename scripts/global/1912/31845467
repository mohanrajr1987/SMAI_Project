<p>We have a bunch of maven2 projects where we are shading in various provided dependencies to create uber jars.  When the provided dependency is built it does not trigger the build of the project defining the shaded dependency. Is there a way to tell Jenkins that we want to automatically resolve the provided dependencies as upstream builds?  (I know that we can manually specify which builds should trigger which other builds)</p>
