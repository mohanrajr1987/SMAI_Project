<p>I have a project base on Ant build ,I want to change the build tool from Ant to maven,But there is a big problem . I have a jar file in my project ,and it can be modified by multi developers. The jar file is located on special system and there is text file beside it. Every time each developer change the jar file ,he/she set the flag(is Editing?) inside the text file to true while editing the jar file. When he/she finished editing the jar file,he/she set the flag inside the text file to false,and then copy it to lib folder in project. How could I handle this process in maven repository ?</p>
