<p>I'm having some trouble configuring Buildship for Eclipse the way I want. I currently have > 50 projects always open in Eclipse, but I want to move to having only the projects I am actively working on in Eclipse, and the other projects would use a Maven repository to resolve their dependency.</p>  <p>Lets say ProjectA (which contains a main) depends on ProjectB (a library project). If ProjectB is opened in Eclipse, I would like ProjectA to use ProjectB directly. A change in the code in ProjectB would be noticeable when running ProjectA. However, if ProjectB is closed, I would like ProjectA to use the ProjectB's JAR located in the Maven repository mentioned in the build.gradle file.</p>  <p>The behavior that I am talking about is detailed <a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-2834?focusedCommentId=103757&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-103757" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do that using Buildship? Or should I use another Gradle Eclipse plugin?</p>
