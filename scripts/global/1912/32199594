<p>I am implementing EAR with multiple WAR files, both war files uses same module but in one module we added more classes (module1 of war1) and in another module we have added few classes(module1 of war2). So i am adding all jars of both wars into EAR lib folder but the problem is while adding it module1 is always replacing with latest war which is running at last in dependency hierarchy of EAR pom.xml. I wants to make it in such a way that, it should keep existing class files of module1 and if any new classes found in other wars for same module (module1) then it should append those classes. I am not finding exact info on it. If anyone already aware of it, please help !!!!</p>
