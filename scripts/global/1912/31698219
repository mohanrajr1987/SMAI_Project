<p>I have got a project with a number of modules in it, now, e.g. I have a module M1 and its version 1.0.0 and in the same project I have got 8 other modules in which I have M1 as a dependency. </p>  <p>The problem is when I make a change in M1, update version to 1.0.1 and upload it to central repo, I have to change that version number 8 times. </p>  <p>I want to use this version number as property, which I have tried to put it as as a prop in parent pom but a maven warning saying its not right to do...</p>  <p>any thoughts? thanks in advance</p>
