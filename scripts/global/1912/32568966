<p>I’m building custom tag which I want make available as single jar file. I seem to be having a problem with tld file and how to include it into build process.</p>  <p><strong>My current folder structure:</strong></p>  <pre><code>src license.md     mian         java             my.package                 class1.java                 class2.java         resources             META-INF                 customtag.tld </code></pre>  <p><strong>Part of pom.xml (<code>.tld</code> file is not included into build process by default)</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;resources&gt; &lt;resource&gt;                 &lt;directory&gt;${basedir}/src/main/resources/META-INF&lt;/directory&gt;                 &lt;targetPath&gt;META-INF&lt;/targetPath&gt;                 &lt;filtering&gt;true&lt;/filtering&gt;                 &lt;includes&gt;                     &lt;include&gt;customtag.tld&lt;/include&gt;                 &lt;/includes&gt;  &lt;/resource&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The above works but:</p>  <ol> <li>It doesn’t look nice to me, especially the path for directory</li> <li>In NetBeans extra branch is created in Project view. Needless to say this really looks crappy.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/peehZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/peehZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></li> <li>I need that entry in pom.xml because otherwise the .tld file will not be included in the jar.</li> </ol>  <p><strong>First Question:</strong> Is there some setting in Maven which will include <code>${basedir}/src/main/resources/META-INF</code> folder contents by default?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Alternative approach:</strong></p>  <pre><code>src license.md ckeditor.tld     mian         java             my.package                 class1.java                 class2.java </code></pre>  <p><strong>Part of pom.xml (<code>.tld</code> file is not included into build process by default)</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;resource&gt;                 &lt;directory&gt;${basedir}&lt;/directory&gt;                 &lt;targetPath&gt;META-INF&lt;/targetPath&gt;                 &lt;filtering&gt;true&lt;/filtering&gt;                 &lt;includes&gt;                     &lt;include&gt;customtag.tld&lt;/include&gt;                 &lt;/includes&gt;  &lt;/resource&gt; </code></pre>  <p>With that approach there is no long path in <code>pom.xml</code>, no extra branch created in Netbeans project view but I’m not sure if that location is correct. I have found many links like this one <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3105539/where-do-i-put-the-tld-file-so-that-the-resulting-jar-file-built-with-maven2-is">Where do I put the .tld file so that the resulting JAR file built with maven2 is properly packaged?</a> which say that tld files in project code should be put into <code>src/main/resources/META-INF</code>.</p>  <p><strong>Second Question:</strong> What is the correct/recommended location of the <code>.tld</code> file inside the Maven project? Please note that I’m asking about project location and not location in created jar file (it has to be <code>META-INF</code>, I know that).</p>
