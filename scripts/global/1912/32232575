<p>I have an eclipse plugin that has been around for a while. We have always built the plugin manually. I am trying to automate the build process. So first I added maven 2 and now I have the pom.xml and I right clicking my project and doing Run As -> maven... and then i put in clean install as seen below. Ignore the error, I changed the basedirectory to not include some sensitive information.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0R6pB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0R6pB.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>Now I am seeing this:</p>  <pre><code>[ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR :  [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------- [ERROR] myProject/src/com/myCompany/is/dt/eclipse/wizards/build/Somewizard.java:[5,34] package org.eclipse.core.resources does not exist </code></pre>  <p>There are more errors besides this. But I have all of these packages in eclipse. I just need to make maven 2 point at them some how. Any ideas?</p>
