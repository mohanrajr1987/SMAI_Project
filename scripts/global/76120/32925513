<p>I have a model Project that has many Reports (I'm shorthanding code here)...</p>  <pre><code>Project   has_many :project_reports   has_many :reports, :through =&gt; :project_reports  ProjectReport   belongs_to :project   belongs_to :report  Report   has_one :project_report   has_one :project, :through =&gt; :project_report </code></pre>  <p>I have a validation in Report that checks to make sure there isn't a report with the same date on it so I don't get duplicates with the same date in the scope of the project.</p>  <pre><code>Validation   unless self.project.reports.where(:report_date =&gt; self.report_date).empty?     self.errors.add(:report_date, "report already exists for this date")   end </code></pre>  <p>When this validation is called in Report the callback after_update is called on Project instead of the callback in Report. Specifically this happens when I reference the project association. So even if I just do this...</p>  <pre><code>Validation   self.project </code></pre>  <p>It calls after_save in Project instead of in Report. Any help or clarification would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>
