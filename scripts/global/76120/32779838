<p>I have the following problem:</p>  <p>I have two models , that are connected to an external database (Mysql) The right name of the two tables in the external database are: <code>f_aziende</code> and <code>f_partecipanti</code> (it's italian). In my Rails app i created two models to connect to these tables and i called:</p>  <p><code>formation_db</code> and <code>reference_db</code>.</p>  <p>Here my models code:</p>  <pre><code>class ReferenceDb &lt; ActiveRecord::Base         establish_connection "#{Rails.env}_db2"         self.table_name = "f_partecipanti"     self.primary_key = 'id'           belongs_to :formation_db   end  class FormationDb &lt; ActiveRecord::Base         establish_connection "#{Rails.env}_db2"         self.table_name = "f_aziende"     self.primary_key = 'id'           has_many :reference_dbs , :foreign_key =&gt; "id_azienda"  end </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that i'm not able to update all the rows associated to <code>formation_db</code>. Also , i'm not sure if the association of the two models is correct. I mean , in this case what is the convenction of the rails words?</p>  <p>In my others project i usually write:</p>  <pre><code>@company.update_attributes(params[:company]) </code></pre>  <p>and i update all the things related to company in one line of code. How can i create something similar to this in my case?</p>
