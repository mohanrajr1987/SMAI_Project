<p>I've upgraded from Rails 3.2 to Rails 4.1.12 and I got an error message running</p>  <pre><code>rake db:drop db:create db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test </code></pre>  <p>The error message is an SQL error caused by Factory Girl with missing tables. But why is Factory Girl initialized on <code>db:schema:load</code> at all?</p>  <p>It is interesting that if I downgrade to Rails 4.1.11, the problem disappears.</p>
