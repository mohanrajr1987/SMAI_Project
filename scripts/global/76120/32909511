<p>I am part of a large application and we are attempting to add translations to the app. We are using I18n and en_US.yml is our default file the translator refers to unless a user signs up with a different language. I have discovered in development that if a user isn't logged in, all translated phrases show up fine. However, once you log in, any new pages now render with errors like this:</p>  <pre><code>translation missing: pages.perspective_metrics_page.weight </code></pre>  <p>Now, any pages you visited before logging in will render with the translations and no error, and even if you log out any pages you have visited while logged in will continue to render with errors. The stack we are currently using is Rails 3.2.17/Backbone/React. This is the gem we are using for putting I18n code in our javascript.</p>  <pre><code># allow rails internationalization to be used in javascript gem "i18n-js", "&gt;= 3.0.0.rc8"  </code></pre>  <p>It seems to me there is some kind of issue with the way things are being cached or with the loading of I18n compared to the models. This stack overflow page seems to point in that direction, but I still can't figure out what is wrong with our app.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4884970/mixed-locales-in-rails-i18n">Mixed locales in Rails i18n</a></p>  <p>Appreciate any help given. Let me know if you need to see some of our code from the config file or anything else. Thanks!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>The version of the I18n gem we are using is 0.6.9</p>
