<p>We have an older Rails 3.2 app that is using the Asset pipeline. It is now including both the original js files from app/assets AND an application.js. Ideally, we'd like to remove the application.js from the page in development. Is there a config variable to have the uncompressed, unminified javascript files from app/assets only?</p>  <p>The layout application.html.erb is</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    "application" %&gt;   &lt;%= javascript_include_tag "application" %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>thx</p>
