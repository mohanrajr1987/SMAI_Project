<p>I have developed an ASP.NET WEB API that generates JSON data to be consumed by some other party. Now I have received a request for adding some extra data in each JSON response about the version of the WEB API.</p>  <p>Is there a simple way to extend the built-in JSON formatter so it will auto-append/prepend some fixed JSON properties whenever it formats some data-model or a collection of some data-model?</p>  <p>Thanks for any good advice :-)</p>
