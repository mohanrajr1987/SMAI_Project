<p>I think this should be a pretty simple question, though I can't seem to find anything on it. </p>  <p>I have a form which includes a bunch of fields that are dynamically generated from a list in the Database (using fields_for).</p>  <p>The labels for each field look like this in database: ABC, DooRs, GREen DogS, aBc, etc.</p>  <p>My problem is that the label helper formats the label by simply capitalizing the first word of each field: Abc, Doors, Green dogs, Abc, etc.</p>  <p>Is there a way that I can keep the format from the Database?</p>  <p><strong>Code:</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;%= f.fields_for :dynamic do |s|  %&gt; &lt;% s.label dyn.field_name %&gt; </code></pre>
