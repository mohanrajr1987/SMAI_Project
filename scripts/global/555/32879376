<p>I have the .mrm file (multiresolution file) which is used by the software Intericad to model furnitures and others (architecture and design).</p>  <p>Here the file <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ysz6ztv7vcg9296/lailan01.mrm?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/ysz6ztv7vcg9296/lailan01.mrm?dl=0</a></p>  <p>Here is the excepted output of the model <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8vwsojwb1juabps/lailan01.jpg?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/8vwsojwb1juabps/lailan01.jpg?dl=0</a></p>  <p>The problem is that file format is weird! I found a version to Gothic and to Intel of multiresolution files. Honestly, I don't know which want it belongs. Actually, I installed Blender using this krximpexp .sourceforge.net importer/exporter and didn't works.</p>  <p>I have to convert the file from .mrm to .obj (for example or another less weird ;-) ). I need the format file specification. Anyone have some ideas to solve that?</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
