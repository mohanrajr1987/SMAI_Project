<p>Our application(UI) has to deal with presenting results of calculations (complex/simple). Each value/number has to be formatted either in terms of currency/quantity etc.  for display since we receive raw data from the backend. Currently we perform all these kind of formatting on the UI side using our own functions written in javascript. For example:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>formatAmount: function (value) {   jQuery.sap.require("sap.ui.core.format.NumberFormat");   var oNumberFormat = sap.ui.core.format.NumberFormat.getFloatInstance({     maxFractionDigits: 2,     groupingEnabled: true,   });   value = (oNumberFormat.format(Number(value).toFixed(2)));   return value + " \u20ac";  // â‚¬ Symbol },</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>As I went along with the development I realized that the UI included several formatting with multiple functions. Since we are doing the UI testing locally with sample data binded to the UI elements, I don't experience performance issues during display. But I have a bad feeling when I think about formatting large amount of data coming from the backend and presenting it on the UI.</p>  <p>So I would like to ask if it is a good idea to perform such formatting on the UI side or should I in any case handle this on the backend? Do you have suggestions how these value formatting could be avoided?</p>  <p>Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.</p>
