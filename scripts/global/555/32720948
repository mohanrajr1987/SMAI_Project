<p>Why does the following code produce '100%' in my percentage-formatted <code>cells(1,1)</code></p>  <pre><code>Worksheets("Sheet1").cells(1,1).value = .05 </code></pre>  <p>EDIT: I made my question much simpler as the comments cleared up some of the confusion.</p>  <p>EDIT: I realized later that I accidentally changed my cells() value again to 100%. Because it happened at a particular place in my code, I thought it was some sort of rounding issue. My problem should be solved now :).</p>
