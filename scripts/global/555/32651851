<p>I am trying to get a macro always to run on a sheet. The macro adds either a single or double line to the top edge of row range based on a cell value. My issue is that whenever I clear the sheet or try to run another macro to add data to the sheet every single line gets formatted. I know I need to have the "HR-Cal" sheet call this macro.  </p>  <pre><code>Sub reformat() ' harness double line Dim rng As Range Dim aCell As Range, bCell As Range Dim ws As Worksheet Dim lRow As Long   Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("HR-Cal")  With ws     '~~&gt; Find last row in Col Q     lRow = .Range("Q" &amp; .Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row      '~~&gt; Set your Find Range     Set rng = .Range("Q5:Q" &amp; lRow)      '~~&gt; Find (When searching for "*" after add "~" before it.
