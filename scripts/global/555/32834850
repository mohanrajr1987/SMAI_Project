<p>I'm trying to use conditional formatting to highlight a cell based on the value of another Excel. For example in the picture below, I would like to highlight values in E cell if they exceed the number in cells G. FYI - about half of the values in cells G will be 90, the rest will be 30.</p>  <p>Refer to image link to see what sample data looks like <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RoTeU" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/RoTeU</a>. png</p>
