<p>I have a text to display as TextView in Android, the text consists of various lines like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Text1</p>      <p>Text2</p>      <p>Text3</p> </blockquote>  <p>But the problem is that when displayed it appears like this ignoring the line breaks:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Text1   Text2   Text3</p> </blockquote>  <p>I know what you are thinking, just add <code>\r\n</code> at the end of every line, but this isn't an option at the moment for me.</p>  <p>Is there a way to have Android respecting the line breaks in the text?</p>  <p>Thanks! Jose</p>
