<p>I am having a problem with CSS. I have <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with two <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s inside. One of them has the style <code>float:left</code>, the other one has <code>float:right</code>. Their width is set to 50% and it all works great, they are aligned exactly the way they should. The problem is when I set @media min-width:500px, I want them to behave normally as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and to display one below other. This happens, but second div is not aligned to left as it should, instead it stays to right, and just goes below the first div. </p>  <p>How do I fix this?</p>
