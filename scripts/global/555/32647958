<p>I'm developing rich text editor, but i have made decision that i won't to use content editable and textarea. So i make own line breaking and measurement of content on every line. There are same reason to make this without content editable co i ca'nt change this behaviour.</p>  <p>But my question is. If i write text in arabic format (because i have request for this as a feature) how can i make right behaviour of arabic formating with combination with left to right and right to left text writing? I found some discusions here on stack overflow and others, but o think that is really hard to do it without font glyph info. Because that is not possible read from javascript. But google docs don't use contenteditable or input and still they can do it. But i don't know how :D For example if you write text in arabic and mark it by some text style (span) than browser split the characters so they don't look like if it write in one span.</p>  <p>Do you have somebody same experince for this?</p>  <p>Thank you for response</p>  <p>Stanislav Hacker</p>
