<p>I'm trying to format a date variable to look like <code>"mmm-yy,"</code> but when the date is 2016, after the formatting takes place, the date changes to 2015. Here is my code:</p>  <p>(Result is the string result of an input box, the box requests that the user enter the date in <code>mmm-yy</code> form, and there is a test before this code to ensure that there is a hypen as the fourth character. </p>  <p>The other validation tests occur after this code, as I found that the string had to be formatted as a date in order for the tests to work.) </p>  <pre><code>        result2 = result         result2 = Format(result2, "mmm-yy") </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions?                                            </p>
