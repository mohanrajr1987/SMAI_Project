<p>JAVA OUTPUT Question, please help. </p>  <p>How to format two outputs, first is to have an ouput using HALF_UP rounding and currency formating and the second is to have an ouput with precentage?</p>  <p>Supporting docs: </p>  <p>(A) orginal assignment</p>  <p>Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</p>  <p>Programming Assignment â€“ Discount Coupon</p>  <p>A supermarket awards coupons depending on how much a customer spends on groceries. For example, if you spend $50, you will get a coupon worth eight percent of that amount. The following table shows the percent used to calculate the coupon awarded for different amounts spent. Write a program that calculates and prints the value of the coupon a person can receive based on groceries purchased and the amount paid after the discount is applied.</p>  <p>Money Spent</p>  <p>Coupon Percent</p>  <p>Less than $10</p>  <p>No coupon</p>  <p>Between $10 and $60</p>  <p>8%</p>  <p>Between $61 and $150</p>  <p>10%</p>  <p>Between $151 and $210</p>  <p>12%</p>  <p>More than $210</p>  <p>14%</p>  <p>Note, as specified, it is not clear how to handle boundary conditions. For example, what is the coupon percent for $150.25? You should decide how you are going to handle boundary conditions and be sure to explain your choice in the program documentation.</p>  <p>Your program should use a currency instance for formatting dollar amounts and a percent instance for formatting percents. They can both be found in the java.text.NumberFormat package. Use the HALF_UP rounding mode for your currency displays.</p>  <p>Here is a sample run: run: Please enter the cost of your grocies: 78.24 You earned a discount of $7.82. (10% of your purchase) Please pay $70.42. Thank you for shopping with us!</p>  <p>(B) code so far </p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner; import java.text.NumberFormat;  public class Coupon {      /**      * @param args the command line arguments      */     public static void main(String[] args) {         // TODO code application logic here           Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);         NumberFormat currency = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();           //Variables          double amountSpent=0;         double couponAmount = 0;         double totalAfterCoupon= 0;          final double lessThanTen = 0.00;         final double betweenTenAndSixity = 0.08;         final double betweenSixtyOneAndOneHundredAndFifty = 0.10;         final double betweenOneHundredAndFiftyOneAndTwoHundredAndTen = 0.12;         final double overTwoHundredAndTen = 0.14;            System.out.print("Please enter the cost of your groceries: ");         amountSpent = input.nextDouble();          if (amountSpent&lt;10 &amp;&amp; amountSpent&gt;=0)         {             couponAmount = lessThanTen * amountSpent;             System.out.printf("You earned a discount of ", currency.format(couponAmount), "(0% of your purchase)");         }         else if (amountSpent&gt;=10 &amp;&amp; amountSpent&lt;=60.49)         {             couponAmount = betweenTenAndSixity * amountSpent;             System.out.printf("You earned a discount of ", currency.format(couponAmount), "(10% of your purchase)");         }         else if (amountSpent&gt;=60.50 &amp;&amp; amountSpent&lt;=150.49)         {             couponAmount = betweenSixtyOneAndOneHundredAndFifty * amountSpent;         }         else if (amountSpent&gt;=150.50 &amp;&amp; amountSpent&lt;=210)         {             couponAmount =  betweenOneHundredAndFiftyOneAndTwoHundredAndTen* amountSpent;         }         else if (amountSpent&gt;210)            {             couponAmount =  overTwoHundredAndTen* amountSpent;           }         else          {         System.out.println("Please enter your total bill between $0.00 or greater.
