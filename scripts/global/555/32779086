<p>I use a dictionary for formatting a string with:</p>  <pre><code>print '%(duration)s' % {'duration':'898'} </code></pre>  <p>Everything works as expected. Now I want to make sure the replacement for %(duration) will be filled with zeros on the left so it has 5 digits. Result should look like: ''00898'' It is guaranteed that duration will never has more 5 digits.</p>  <p>How would <code>'%(duration)s'</code> look like?</p>
