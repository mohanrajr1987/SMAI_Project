<p>I'm trying to analyse some race data in R. The data is mainly finishing times, currently in the custom format hh:mm:ss, however when imported to R I cannot do any analysis as I'll always receive the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>Warning message: In mean.default(Swim) : argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone advice how best to get around this, albeit probably simple, stumbling block for me? Thanks for your help.</p>
