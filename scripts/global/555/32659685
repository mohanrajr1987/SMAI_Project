<p>I'm new to python, recently I have migrated to Python 3 and I'm trying to get used to the <code>format()</code> function. </p>  <p>What I'm trying to do is to <code>print()</code> the temperature I create in floating-points, like so:</p>  <pre><code>temperature = [23, 24, 25, 26, 27] print("Today's temperature is %.02f" % (temperature[0])) </code></pre>  <p>Instead of using <code>%.02f</code>, I would like to know how that could be written in the <code>format()</code> function instead  of the <code>%</code> percentage.</p>
