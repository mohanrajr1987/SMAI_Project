<p>I am trying to open a telnet connection, write one string, then print everything from the telnet server in Python. I assume I am missing something obvious because the documentation seems pretty self-explanatory and doing what I think is the exact same thing in terminal works fine.</p>  <p>Here is the Python code:</p>  <pre><code>import telnetlib  telnet = telnetlib.Telnet() telnet.open('192.168.1.128', 9801, 10) telnet.write("SYSTEM_CAL")  print(telnet.read_all()) </code></pre>  <p>This times out after 10 seconds / doesn't successfully connect to the server I assume. Here is the output:</p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/Volumes/Work/Scripting/Telnet Test/main.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;     print(telnet.read_all())   File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/telnetlib.py", line 385, in read_all     self.fill_rawq()   File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/telnetlib.py", line 576, in fill_rawq     buf = self.sock.recv(50) socket.timeout: timed out </code></pre>  <p>In the image below I connect to the same server in terminal and everything works fine. At the end I give the "DISCONNECT" command taken by the server which is why the connection closes.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5cnqn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5cnqn.png" alt="Connecting to Telnet server in terminal"></a></p>  <p>Am I missing something? Why is this working in Terminal and not in Python?</p>
