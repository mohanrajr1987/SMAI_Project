<p>I am creating a ship game where you can shoot down enemies and upgrade your ship. I have not done everything because i have a problem with the bullets.</p>  <p>Before we get started i would like to point out that i am currently using python 2.7 and pygame 1.9. I am aware that there are later versions of pygame and python but i started writing this before i knew that there were later versions of pygame for python 3.4.</p>  <p>I would also like to point out that i am a very basic coder and do not know some of the advanced things yet.</p>  <pre><code>import pygame import time  pygame.init()  white = (255,255,255) black = (0,0,0) red = (255,0,0) green = (0,255,0) blue = (0,0,255)  display_width = 800 display_height = 600  gameDisplay = pygame.display.set_mode((display_width,display_height)) pygame.display.set_caption('Destroyer')  clock = pygame.time.Clock() FPS = 60  font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 25)  shipW = 69 shipH = 88  #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Other Functions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#    #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Game~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#  def game_loop():      shipImg = pygame.image.load('ship1.png')      face = 1      #The direction that the ship is facing.      #1 = North, 2 = East, 3 = South, 4 = West      x = (display_width * 0.45 )#location of ship -
