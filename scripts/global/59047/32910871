<p>I am running a python 2.7 script called 'Pipelines.py' in Spyder, and am having it run from a specific folder using preferences; lets say 'C:\User\MyProgram'. The code itself is saved in 'C:\User\MyProgram\Scripts'. However the wdir when ran is 'C:\User\MyProgram\Scripts'. Due to this it can't import the things it is looking for, and it gives an <code>ImportError: No module named foo</code> If I change the name to anything else including Pipelines_ or even pipelines it runs from the correct dir. (if I manually change the wdir it work no problem) Is it the specific name that is causing this, or am I missing something? Thanks!</p>
