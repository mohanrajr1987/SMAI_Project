<p>I'm writing a simple code in <code>Python 2.7</code> to change a couple very long files i have into text files so that I can scroll through them in a text reader. </p>  <p>However, i found out that the <code>numpy.array</code> in the file has very long floats that end in unneeded scientific notation. I try and use <code>numpy.around</code> or <code>numpy.round</code> to change these to only have two places after the decimal but it doesn't change anything. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>import h5py import sys from Tkinter import Tk from tkFileDialog import askopenfilename import numpy as np  sys.stdout.write( 'Please pick file from window\n') fileName = askopenfilename() # show an "Open" dialog box and return the path to the selected file sys.stdout.write(fileName) f = h5py.File(fileName, 'r') dataset = f['/dcoor'][:]   newname = raw_input('New file name ') print type(dataset[0][0]) dataset = np.asarray(dataset) dataset = dataset.astype(float) print type(dataset[0][0]) print '\nDataset before rounding: \n', dataset dataset = np.around(dataset, decimals = 2) print '\nDataset after rounding: \n', dataset np.savetxt(newname,dataset) </code></pre>  <p>I do not get any error messages and my output is this:</p>  <pre><code>New file name test4 &lt;type 'numpy.float32'&gt; &lt;type 'numpy.float64'&gt;  Dataset before rounding:  [[  1.48999996e+01   1.07949997e+02   1.80000007e-01   3.59000000e+02     0.00000000e+00]  [  1.60100002e+01   1.07489998e+02   3.89999986e-01   3.98000000e+02     0.00000000e+00]  [  1.86700001e+01   1.07669998e+02   5.89999974e-01   4.26000000e+02     0.00000000e+00]  ...,   [  2.78700008e+01   2.75200005e+01   2.99973999e+03   4.15000000e+02     0.00000000e+00]  [  2.60499992e+01   2.72800007e+01   2.99991992e+03   4.10000000e+02     0.00000000e+00]  [  2.56599998e+01   2.85400009e+01   3.00009009e+03   4.37500000e+02     0.00000000e+00]]  Dataset after rounding:  [[  1.49000000e+01   1.07950000e+02   1.80000000e-01   3.59000000e+02     0.00000000e+00]  [  1.60100000e+01   1.07490000e+02   3.90000000e-01   3.98000000e+02     0.00000000e+00]  [  1.86700000e+01   1.07670000e+02   5.90000000e-01   4.26000000e+02     0.00000000e+00] </code></pre>  <p>Which is odd since it appears to round some numbers but not others, and keeps the trailing <code>zeros</code> as well. i converted the original <code>array</code> because i thought that might make a difference but obviously it did not. Could the problem be that the <code>array</code>'s are so long? Each one is roughly 16,000 rows. Could it be that the original <code>array</code> was saved in an <code>hdf5</code> file which keeps the original format? I can't go back and retest my mice i work with so if that's the case i'm rather <code>SOL</code>. Thank you for any help.</p>
