<p>I have an assignment for my class, and even when I try everything, something seems to go wrong with my code. I'm supposed to make a tiny program that would check the strength of one's password. Could anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Much appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>p = raw_input("Enter password") if len(p) &lt;= 6:     print("Weak1") elif len(p) &gt; 6 and len(p) &lt;=12:     if p.lower:         print("Weak2")     elif p.upper() or int():         print("Medium4") elif len(p) &gt; 12:     if p.lower and not p.upper():         print("Strong6")     elif p.upper() and p.lower():         print("Strong7")     elif int() and p.lower():         print("Strong9") </code></pre>
