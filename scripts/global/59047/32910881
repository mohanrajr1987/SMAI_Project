<p>Pretty simple python 2.7 find/replace text question - I have text files which are all one long line each (no newline characters), and inside each long line are comma-separated sections like so (although there are portions which are not of this format):</p>  <p><code>"Country":"USA","City":"Chicago","Phone":"123-456-7890","Contact":"John Doe"</code></p>  <p>I want to go thru the text files and whenever a <code>':'</code> character is found for one of a couple fields I'm looking for, print out the field and corresponding value (which are always in quotes) with a delimiter between them...so let's say I'm looking just for the <code>'Country'</code> and <code>'City'</code> fields - I'd want to find either of those field names in quotes and print out the corresponding values like so:</p>  <p><code>Country|USA</code> <code>City|Chicago</code></p>  <p>while ignoring all other <code>':'</code> paired values.</p>
