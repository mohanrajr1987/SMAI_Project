<p>I am COMPLETELY new to this so please understand that I don't have the necessary background to figure stuff out on my own so any help is greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>A link that has very similar questions to mine is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21540072/merging-two-files-by-one-common-set-of-identifiers-with-python">Merging two files by one common set of identifiers with python</a>. I am using python on a mac and the files used are csv. Here is an example of what we are wanting to do.</p>  <h1>File 1</h1>  <p>key1 | data1 | data2 |</p>  <p>key2 | data3 |</p>  <h1>File 2</h1>  <p>key2 | data4 |</p>  <p>key3 | data5 |</p>  <h1>I want one with:</h1>  <p>key1 | data1 | data2 |</p>  <p>key2 | data3 | data4 |</p>  <p>key3 | data5 |</p>  <p>This is what we have so far</p>  <pre><code>import csv from collections import defaultdict gene_map = defaultdict(list) with open('GeneInfo.csv', 'rb') as file_one:     csv_reader = csv.reader('file_one', delimiter='\t')     for row in csv_reader:         gene_map[row[1]].append(row[0]) file_one.close()  with open('GeneExpression.csv', 'rb') as file_two:     with open(Combined.txt, 'w') as out_file:         csv_reader = csv.reader(file_two, delimiter='\t')     csv_writer = csv.writer(out_file, delimiter='\t')     for row in csv_reader:         values = gene_map.get(row[0], [])         op_list = []         op_list.append(row[0])         op_list.extend(values)         values.extend(row[1:])         csv_writer.writerow(op_list) file_two.close() out_file.close() </code></pre>  <p>The error we get is on line 7 and it says that the list index is out of range. I don't know how to fix this. Are we on the right track? Any suggestions? Improvements?</p>
