<p>How can I increment key value pair inside a for loop while iterating over dictionary in python?</p>  <pre><code>for key,value in mydict.iteritems():      if condition:         #inc key,value     #something to do </code></pre>  <p>I have tried using <code>next(mydict.iteritems())</code> and <code>mydict.iteritems().next()</code> but in vain.</p>  <p>I am using python2.7.</p>  <p>EDIT - I know that forloop automatically increments the key,value pair. I want to manually increment to next pair ( Thus resulting in 2 increments). Also I can't use continue because I want both the key value pair to be accessible at same time. So that when I increment, I have the current key value pair as well as the next. If I use continue, I lose access to current and only get next key,value pair.</p>
