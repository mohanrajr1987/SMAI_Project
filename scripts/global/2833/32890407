<p>Maybe someone knows how to drag elements which have implemented html5 drag&amp;drop. I need this in e2e test using nightwatchjs. I tried:</p>  <pre><code>        browser.useCss()         .moveToElement("div.test-dragbtn-row",10,10)         .mouseButtonDown(0)         .moveToElement('div.test-container-root',50,50)         .mouseButtonUp(0).pause(3000); </code></pre>  <p>In browser I can see that element is pressed, but second move not works, moreover it holds mouse down on element until I enter physically with mouse into browser window.</p>  <p>Maybe someone done test with nightwatchjs for drag and drop, and knows how to overcome this?</p>
