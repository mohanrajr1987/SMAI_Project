<p>I am trying to implement drag and drop between two tableviews.I have a UIView and have two tableviews in it. I want to be able to drop a cell from one tableview to another tableview and vice versa. I do not want to use an external library for this. How can I achieve it? Any tutorial or code to help me figure it out will be great. I already tried to implement Scott-Sherwood tutorial but even the demo doesn't seem to work. </p>  <p>Thanks </p>
