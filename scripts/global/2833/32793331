<p>I'd like to create a web app where the user gets presented with a list of items as shown below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P5ziW.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P5ziW.jpg" alt="Before"></a></p>  <p>Once the items are dropped into the main area, I'd like to automatically draw connections between the items like in this image:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P0nlF.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P0nlF.jpg" alt="After"></a></p>  <p>The connections between the items would depend on the items dragged into the main area, for instance, two green blocks might not connect with each other.</p>  <p>I've been looking at HTML 5 examples for drag-and-drop, but don't know how I'd accomplish the drawing of the lines. </p>  <p>Could someone point me in the right direction? Is HTML 5 not enough? What should I be looking at to accomplish this task?</p>
