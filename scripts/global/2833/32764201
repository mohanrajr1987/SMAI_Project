<p>I am implementing <strong>drag and drop</strong> of files like <a href="http://mvc4beginner.com/Sample-Code/File-Upload/ASP-.NET-MVC-Drag-Drop-File-Upload.html">this</a> in asp.net mvc 5, but my requirement is when i drag files,it should not be immediately uploaded. First drag the files, Then click on a <strong>button("Enter MetaData")</strong> to enter few mandatory properties (metadata-name, category &amp; etc...) for each file, Then click on <strong>other button(Submit)</strong> to submit to upload.</p>  <p>Normally when we drag a file, it immediately gets uploaded, I have to stop it and do it on button click(after filling the other fields). Even any third party js library that has similar functionality ?</p>  <p>I googled a lot but not getting expected results. Can someone please guide me how to go for this requirement or provide me some links to go for this requirement.</p>
