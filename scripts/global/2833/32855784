<p>We are developing a drag and drop CMS called ucraft.me. It is based on Laravel + EmberJS + jQuery + Greensock(GSAP).</p>  <p>Imagine it works the following way:</p>  <ol> <li>There is a blank page with a left panel, where you have different modules to craft your pages. Ex., title, button, image, slider, video, etc... </li> <li>The white page is based on a grid where there can be max 4 modules. </li> </ol>  <p>Now imagine we have a module - button, in the centre of a full width row(span12) and now we decided to drop another module, like Title, which will split the current row into span6 - span6. Currently we are using jQuery draggable droppable, to calculate all the droppable areas and to let the user drop certain elements.</p>  <p>Can someone recommend a better drag and drop library to implement this, is there anyone with a similar experience? Do you think jQuery draggable-droppable is a good choice to implement the drag and drop feature in the site builder? Does it have good performance?</p>  <p>Or should we use HTML5 native drag-and-drop library?</p>  <p>Thanks!!</p>
