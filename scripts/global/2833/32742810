<p>Either this is not easy/can't be done/or I can't find the answer... I can drag drop an image INTO a frame and view it, but in this case I want to do the opposite - I want to drag what's in the frame and drop it onto the desktop as a specific type of document (in this case, a PDF). </p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MmHCeuz.jpg" alt="document in window"></p>  <p>This is an image of a pdf which I already know how to save manually as a pdf. It would be easier for my users to just drag that document onto the desktop as a pdf. Is this even possible and if so, can someone point me in the right direction?</p>
