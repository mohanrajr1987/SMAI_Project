<p>I tried a little script to copy a file into a windows network to multiple machines in an installation setup.</p>  <pre><code>@ECHO OFF SETLOCAL ECHO "%~f1" call :cpy %1 machine1 call :cpy %1 machine2 call :cpy %1 machine3 ...  :cpy net use \\%2\pathonmachines\ password /user:username copy %1 \\%2\pathonmachines\ goto :EOF </code></pre>  <p><code>%1</code> is the path to the drag &amp; dropped file, after this I loop to copy the files.</p>  <p>Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Where's the fault? Should I disconnect after using <code>net use</code>? </p>
