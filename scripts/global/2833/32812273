<p>I wrote a little app in Xcode 6 and updated now to Xcode 7. Now there is no syntax coloring and I cannot drag and drop any Storyboard-elements into the view controller any more. And the autocompiling isn't working, so I can write massive syntax failures without getting a red dot on the left side. </p>  <p>I restarted Xcode several times. I tried to erase the derived data, but nothing changed. </p>  <ul> <li><p>drag and drop: The classes of the ViewControllers didn't change, so it's not an<br> mismatch of the classes. </p></li> <li><p>syntax-coloring: I've tried to change the coloring under "editor" several times, nothing changed. </p></li> </ul>  <p>I'm really hoping for help. Thank you guys!</p>  <p>Best regards,  Michael.  </p>
