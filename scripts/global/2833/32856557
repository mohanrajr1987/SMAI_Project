<p>I have a <code>TControlBar</code> aligned to the bottom of my main form (same width). The height of this Control Bar is fixed. </p>  <p>This Control Bar contains a number of <code>TPanels</code>, aligned horizontally (With matching heights). These panels contain various other components. I want to be able to move and rearrange these panels horizontally side-to-side but disallow vertical movement (fix Top of Panels).</p>  <p>How can I achieve this. I have tried setting the <code>Anchors-&gt;akTop</code> property for each Panel to <code>true</code>. But the panels sometimes move vertically as I try and drag them side to side.</p>  <p>I am using RAD studio XE4</p>
