<p>Currently I need to drag multiple rows from a grid and drop them to a container. As far as I read over the internet, kendo does not support this (even out of the box). Currently I am pushing every selected row to a variable bound to the scope. When I perform the drag from the grid, is it possible to simply take the scope variable which contains the selected rows and drag its content?</p>
