<p>I have created a jpanel with paintcomponent and i have a scribblePane which has draw functionality, i want the jpanel component to overwrite my scribblePane.</p>  <p>I am facing problem with debugging my code and saving it as an image. Currently, i am saving scribblePane as an image and also there is a drawPane in my code which gets added circles in the frame, but i am unable to add these circles to my scribblePane. I tried using separate panel called drawPane and adding it to the scribblePane, but it is not working. Please help.</p>  <p>How to do it? How to add an extra panel and overwrite the scribbledraganddrop panel?</p>  <p>Here is link to my code: <a href="http://pastebin.com/QS3uhJeV" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/QS3uhJeV</a></p>
