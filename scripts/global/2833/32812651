<p>I frequently extract the .aac audio track from .mp4 files that I download (legally, from the media sections of TV channels) for use with my MP3-Player using avconv on Windows:</p>  <pre><code>avconv -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec copy output.aac </code></pre>  <p>The process is a little tedious - I have to open the command prompt, navigate to the folder with the .mp4 file and type the command. I'm looking to speed the process up and what I have in mind is some kind of script/program on my desktop or in some folder (as I always do the conversion in a specific folder) where I can drag and drop the .mp4 file and which then creates the corresponding .aac file in the same folder using aforementioned command line.</p>  <p>Despite having a solid background in programming (Java, C, C++) I have absolutely no idea how to go on about this. I need a little direction on how to tackle this. Is it even possible, do I have several options? Are there better solutions than a drag and drop script/program? Mind you I do not need any worked-out code but just the information on how I could do this using free tools. A program which runs the command line on all .mp4 files in the directory is not an option as many other .mp4 files which I do not want to convert may be present.</p>
