<p>I create custom camera in Android using SurfaceView, and below that I create another view containing 4-5 images. I want to drag that image and drop into the custom camera which I created. But the question is why I need it, actually I want that when camera is open and when I put my camera near the table, then I want that any sample flask or pot suits on hat table or not. So I need to drag that flask on camera.</p>  <p>I search lots in internet. Please help me.</p>  <p>Any help is really appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
