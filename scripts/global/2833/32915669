<p>I have an application I am making where eventually a PDF document has been created (using PDFBOX, btw) that the user will want to save:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGJGJ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGJGJ.jpg" alt="PDF File inside application window"></a></p>  <p>My users have to take a saved copy of that file and physically drag it to another application on my system which I cannot alter. IOW, if I want to put a document into that system I <em>HAVE</em> to drag drop the icon for it into that application. There is no open->file option on that application. Drag drop is my only option.</p>  <p>The users of my application will have the potential of doing hundreds of these every week each. I can't have them hunting around a directory, risking damage to other files, and have them drag drop this file onto the other application. If they drag drop the wrong one <strong><em>IT CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM THAT SYSTEM</em></strong>. I know, stupid, but that is their software and not mine.</p>  <p>I have to make sure that they drop the correct file onto that application and I need it to be easy for them to do. I see that a best case solution would be for them to drag the document they see on the screen over to the other application. Doing it this way, I can have it automatically save the document when they do the drag and place the document on the other application without any fuss.</p>  <p>Is there some way anyone knows how to do this or can even point me in the correct direction?</p>
