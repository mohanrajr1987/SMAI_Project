<p>I have an application with one NSTableView and i can drag&amp;drop some file on the table. If the user drag a file over the cells in my table, each cell becomes highlighted (i have implemented custom highlighting)</p>  <p>In detail it something about:</p>  <ol> <li>If the user drag the file over another cell, it becomes highlighted. The old cell becomes again normal</li> <li>If user drop the file over a cell it becomes also again normal.</li> </ol>  <p>But the problem is if the user start dragging some file over the cells but drop somewhere outside application. The last highlighted cell remains in this state and I don't know how to catch this event.</p>  <p>Has somebody an idea? Preferably in swift</p>  <p>Edit: There is this function to validate drop operations but it get only call if the drop is on the table <code>tableView(tableView: NSTableView, validateDrop info: NSDraggingInfo, proposedRow row: Int, proposedDropOperation dropOperation: NSTableViewDropOperation)</code></p>
