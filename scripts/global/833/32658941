<p>Summarized Problem: I'm looking for a way to determine the height of a webpage through VBA.  Not the height of the internet explorer browser, but the height of the actual webpage itself.  </p>  <p>Context: I have developed a macro that will take screenshots of a record.  The height of the records changes from record to record.  Some records require 2 screenshots, some 3 and in some rare instances 4.  For this reason, I would like to create a conditional statement that will take the proper number of screenshots based on the height of the webpage.</p>
