<p>Check this <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/tdmv7y3L/1/" rel="nofollow">FIDDLE</a></p>  <p>This is like a mobile phone prototype where I have fixed height of <code>50px</code> for <code>header-div</code> and <code>footer-div</code>.</p>  <p>I want the <code>content-div</code> to dynamically adjust its height according to the <code>main-container</code> (which here is acting as mobile screen size). Adjust in such a way that the content overflow should be scrollable in the visible <code>content-div</code> height only.</p>  <p>If I put <code>header-div</code> and <code>footer-div</code> height both <code>10%</code> and <code>content-div</code> height <code>80%</code>. So that it arranges according to the screen size. Trouble here is that the header and footer heights will vary according to screen sizes and as a result will make <code>header-div</code> and <code>footer-div</code> bigger/smaller in height.</p>  <p>This is why I have set a certain height for <code>header-div</code> and <code>footer-div</code> both that is <code>50px</code>. Now I want the <code>content-div</code> to be adjusted in such a way that it dynamically changes its <code>height</code> in accordance to the <code>main-container</code> (parent div)</p>  <p>Appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>
