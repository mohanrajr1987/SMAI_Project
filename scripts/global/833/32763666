<p>Been searching everywhere for a solution to this. How can you set the iframe height to the size of the iframe content when the content is from another domain? I'm using the following javascript but I get the <code>permission denied to access property 'document'</code> because the iframe content is from another domain.</p>  <pre><code>function resizeIframe(iframe) {         if(iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight &lt; 500) {           iframe.height = "500px";         } else {           iframe.height = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + "px";           }   }  &lt;iframe name="myiframe" id="myiframe" onload="setIframeHeight(this.id)... </code></pre>  <p>I've read up on a few hacks but they all include using a second javascript file added to the iframe to send a postMessage back to the parent. However this isnt really much of a solution because for cross domain content you don't have them sort of privileges to go round adding javascript files to their servers.</p>  <p>Any one have any suggestions or alternative solutions?</p>
