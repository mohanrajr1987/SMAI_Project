<p>I've been using swiffy for 2 years, and now with the 7.3 version I have problems with files larger than 2000px of height. The result is a blurry animation. While increased height it gets even more blurry. This didn't happen with older versions. If any of you know what to do for not having a blurred result, please tell me.</p>
