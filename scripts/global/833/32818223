<p>I search for a workaround to scale slider images to a given height and width with owl-carousel2 without any distortion. Like cropping images to a container.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p>my slider item css</p>  <pre><code>width: 100% height:320px; </code></pre>  <p>First I thought if I remove all my img tags and pass the images via data attributes and hooking with a <code>callback function onInitialize</code> would solve the issue but with this solution I have to attach a lot css of on flow to the container which is not the best solution.</p>  <p>What would be the perfect workaround?</p>
