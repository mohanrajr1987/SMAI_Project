<p>I need to know string height so I can set cell height. The problem is I am getting string asynchronous, and I need to know cell Height before creating collection view. And I need this to work with different languages (special characters). </p>  <p>String will be in a label inside the cell. I had some of my solutions, but one did not work with other languages, and the other did work but didnt get the real heigth.</p>
