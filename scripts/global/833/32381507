<p>I searched a lot about this topic but didn't find a suitable answer, only pieces of non-working code or oh-my-god non-working "solutions" (i.e. using textViewDidChange, beginUpdates, endUpdates methods) or similar cases (i.e. using a UILabel - I know that it works but I need an UITextView instead; or using sizeWithFont - I can't do that because the content is an HTML).</p>  <p>The problem is simple and I don't know why the answer seems so complicated.</p>  <p>I'm working on iOS 7. I built a XIB (linked to a UITableViewCell subclass) that contains a UITextView. These textviews in the table are populated with texts of different lengths. The width must not change, the height should.</p>  <p>The desired behaviour is that the height of the cell increases or decreases depending on the text length.</p>  <p>Do you guys have a working code or could you please link me a suitable tutorial or give me some hint?</p>  <p>Thank you very much :).</p>
