<p>I've made the following website using Bootstrap to get my images responsive. When resizing in width the images are perfectly responsive. However, when resizing in height, the images don't resize. </p>  <p>What would be the best way to get this working?</p>  <p><a href="http://bartoosterveer.nl/Jacowebtest/" rel="nofollow">http://bartoosterveer.nl/Jacowebtest/</a></p>
