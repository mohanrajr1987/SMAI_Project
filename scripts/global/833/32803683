<p>I just upgraded my Xcode to version 7 which as you all know using iOS SDK 9. For some reason I'm having problems with the size of the screen now, I'm getting some black spaces at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>  <p>Now I read the following post in Apple's web site :  <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/18351" rel="nofollow">https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/18351</a></p>  <p>So I tried all kind of things related to the launch screen (although that in iOS 8) I never used launch screen. So I tried to add a launch screen image - just a blank one, I also tried instead of using static launch screen to use a XIB screen that I created (which again is just blank) and then I'm getting a result where my screen is all small on the top left corner of the screen.</p>  <p>Did anyone face that issue ? It is very weird :/</p>  <p>Any help / guidance will be much appreciated ! </p>  <p>Thank you ! </p>  <hr>  <p>Edit : The screen as I see it without having the XIB as my launch screen :  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B87Vpzycaz_CVW9NMEdvVmNhV2M" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B87Vpzycaz_CVW9NMEdvVmNhV2M</a></p>  <p>The screen as I see it with the XIB as my launch screen: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B87Vpzycaz_CemxLN2VCNEtTc0U" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B87Vpzycaz_CemxLN2VCNEtTc0U</a></p>
