<p>I have a div with height: auto. Inside there is a div with height: 100% but it doesn't work. How it is possible to make it work without making a table or giving an exact height in px? I'm making a navbar in bootstrap and as the height of the whole navbar changed I expected my nav also will change it's height.</p>  <p>Here is a code: <a href="http://www.bootply.com/OrL4quEWML" rel="nofollow">http://www.bootply.com/OrL4quEWML</a></p>  <p>I need my active tab has a border in the very bottom of header.</p>
