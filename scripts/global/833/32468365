<p>I just put my website live. It's displaying differently than when I tested it to begin with. The site is <a href="http://www.se7enservice.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.se7enservice.com</a>. It's my site, so no spam. Pictures won't show, but not needed here.</p>  <p>When you look at this JSFiddle, you can see that my 'About' sections looks normal. <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/blackRob4953/z8qn39nj/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/blackRob4953/z8qn39nj/</a></p>  <p>However, when you go to the actual live webpage, the margins of the words are lowered. This is only happening on the 'About' and 'Contact Us' Page. </p>  <p><strong>Can anyone explain to me why this is happening, and how to fix it?</strong></p>  <p>**Ignore this style code below, it's the same in the JSFiddle, but I have to post code in order to paste the link...</p>  <pre><code>body{ display: -webkit-flex; display: flex;  -webkit-flex-direction: column; flex-direction: column;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  justify-content: center;   margin: 0 !important; min-height:100vh; min-width: 1280px; width: 100vw; overflow: scroll; } </code></pre>
