<p>I have a LinearLayout containing a TextView. The initial height of LinearLayout is set to 20px where the content of TextView overflows its bounds. I want to animate LinearLayout to expand to wrap content (its Children height). How can I determine the final size of LinearLayout before expanding?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5mOoI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5mOoI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Currently I set Height of View to wrap_content for a moment and after measuring  the final height reset the height to 20 again! obviously this cause an unwanted blink before animation and should be replaced by a better solution.</p>  <pre><code>//I hate these two lines     view.getLayoutParams().height=ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT;     view.requestLayout(); //End of hate!  view.post(new Runnable() {     @Override     public void run() {        int targetHeight = view.getMeasuredHeight();        view.getLayoutParams().height=20;        view.requestLayout();     } }); </code></pre>
