<p>Label doesn't have time to upgrade, depending on the text. When entering text in the label and the subsequent entry of the width and height of the label in a variable, it records the value of the value of the old label. How can I solve the problem?</p>  <pre><code>labelHidden.text = "Some text ..." textWidth = labelHidden.bounds.width textHeight = labelHidden.bounds.height </code></pre>
