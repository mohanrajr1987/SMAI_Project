<p>I don't have right to upload images to show. The question like the title described.My layout is right, from UIViewController A to start UIImagePickerController to shoot video in portrait mode, when I use the video I shot and back to UIViewController A,  the A's UIView's height become reduced.But it's right when I shoot video in landscape mode.</p>  <p>I don't know if I can describe the problem clearly above.</p>
