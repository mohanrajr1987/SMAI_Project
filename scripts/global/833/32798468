<p>I have a problem and just cant find a solution to it after searching for several hours and trying different things.</p>  <p>Link to the website: <a href="http://wa4.w-weber.eu/muelltonnen/pdf/muelltonne-1100-l-flachdeckel-c-zeichnung.html" rel="nofollow">http://wa4.w-weber.eu/muelltonnen/pdf/muelltonne-1100-l-flachdeckel-c-zeichnung.html</a></p>  <p>I want a to display a pdf on a website, being responsive and being displayed with 80% of its original size so you can click on it to enlarge it. The best solution for me so far was to use the object tag instead of the iframe. The problem is, that you have to give the object a specific height in px in order for it to change it, so height: 100%; doesnt work because it only shows a specific amount of the containing pdf â€“ like it does now. I have to install several pdfs on the website, so I cant just take the specific px height of the pdf, I want it to be shown in height 100%. Is there any possibility to do that? I read that you need to give the body a height of 100% and set it to position relative, but I tried it all and I havent come to a satisfying result. </p>  <p>Do you have any idea how I can display the pdf across all browsers so its responsive, shows 100% of the containing pdf, and keeps the header and footer I have created?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance, Cheers</p>
