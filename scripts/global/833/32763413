<p>I'm quite new to CSS3. I've read other questions but I'm not sure they cover my case, so please be patient :)</p>  <p>I have this example page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;    body { background-color: black; margin: 0; }    #main { background-color: red; width: 60%; height: 100vh; margin: auto; }    #header { background-color: white; width: 100%; height: 25%; max-height: 100px; }    #article { background-color: orange; width: 100%; height: 55%; }    #footer { background-color: blue; width: 100%; height: 20%; max-height: 80px; }   &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;div id="main"&gt;    &lt;div id="header"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div id="article"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div id="footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>There's one additional mandatory behaviour I have to implement, plus an optional one.</p>  <p><strong>The mandatory</strong></p>  <p>As you can see yourself, once the browser window gets quite high, #header and #footer correctly stop to grow, leaving their height to the background red #main div. What I need is that #article gets this space, therefor always "pushing" the #footer to the lower border of the browser screen.</p>  <p><strong><em>The optional</em></strong></p>  <p>The layout itself resizes horizontally without any limit, but the #article div has setted a background image that does fade on its left and right sides. To be more precise, it's a 1000x1 image fading in from coords (1,1) to (100,1) and fading out from (901,1) to (1000,1), vertically repeated to cover the height of #article. How can I get the effect that this image stretches only in its non-fading area (so that the faded borders would not get stretched)? Can I get it without any extra div (as in that case, the mandatory behaviour would reapeat it self horizontally)?</p>  <p>Thank you so much :)</p>
