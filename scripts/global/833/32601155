<p>I wanted to resize a image if it is too large, but i want it to keep it's aspect ratio, how can i just define it's height and let it automatically get it's width?    </p>  <pre><code>ImageIcon image2 = new ImageIcon(image);  //Check if image size is more than 200  if(!checking){     Image img = image2.getImage() ;       Image newimg = img.getScaledInstance( "What to put here?", 200,  java.awt.Image.SCALE_SMOOTH ) ;       image2 = new ImageIcon( newimg ); }     JButton newimage = new JButton(image2); </code></pre>
