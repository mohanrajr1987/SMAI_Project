<p>I've got a one to many relationship in.  I have an Application which has multiple files which can be uploaded into it.  The Application view contains the Uploaded file list (the files in the list just contain meta data about the file such as file name, file size etc.).  I am having trouble with the ability to sort the nested list.  I am using the sortableColumn to call a sort action in my controller.  How can I retrieve an application and specify that the nested list of uploaded files be sorted by the requested attribute (ex. File Name, File Size etc.)</p>
