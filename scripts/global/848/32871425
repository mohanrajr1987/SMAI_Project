<p>I have a little bit of problem with writing SQL queries in Groovy (v2.1.7. Don't even ask, why it's so old :) ). So I, have three tables to join, I can join them on their ids, through a third one, which contains the id pairs. However, I would like to create a left join, so everything, even if it's null on the right side, should go into the joined table - the problem is, whatever I do, the null-containg lines don't show up. I suspect, that it's about the pair-containg table, but I don't know for sure.</p>  <pre><code>Table1 {   id   sth }  Table2 {   id   ath }  Table3 {   t1id   t2id } </code></pre>  <p>And in its Groovy file, the Table1 has a hasMany relation on Table2.</p>  <pre><code>static hasMany = [t2s: Table2] </code></pre>  <p>As far as I saw, I have to join through these relations.</p>  <p>My SQL query looks like:</p>  <pre><code>Table1.executeQuery(    "SELECT t1.sth, t2.ath " +    "FROM Table1 t1 LEFT JOIN t1.t2s t2 " +    "WHERE t1.sth = ......) </code></pre>  <p>Is there any other way to write SQL queries in Grails?</p>
