<p>I'm looking to add a "Do you want to log out?" dialog that pops up before the session ends, and the user can click OK to ping the site and not get automatically logged out. </p>  <p>To code this, I would ideally only like to add a <code>&lt;asset:javascript src="session.logout.dialog.js" /&gt;</code> into the layout.</p>  <p>The issue in only including a .js file is that I need links to controllers in the JavaScript file. I'm not aware of a way to code the links without some kind of initialization code in the gsp such as <code>initLogoutDialog("${createLink(...)}")</code>. Does the Asset Pipeline plugin allow me a way to bypass the normal restrictions and use createLink as if it were a gsp?</p>
