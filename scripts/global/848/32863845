<p>For my integration tests I load a 'seed' database in bootstrap.groovy. I also manually load up different databases from time to time during development to try out different scenarios.</p>  <p>Trouble is, the database migration plugin (many thanks Bert!) only seems to run during startup, before getting to the bootstrap code and I can't see anywhere I can trigger it to run again.</p>  <p>Which means if I load up a db that is 'out of date' then I have to shut down the app and restart it just to get the migration done. Then I have to remember to take a snapshot of the 'new' database so I don't have to do it again next time.</p>  <p>All of which really hits productivity, especially across multiple refactorings.</p>  <p>Are there better ways of doing this? Ideally I'd like service class method 'runMigrations()' or something. Then I could call it after my loading tools or from within my bootstrap code.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
