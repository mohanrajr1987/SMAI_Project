<p>I'm trying to convert a Grails 2 controller filter into a Grails 3 interceptor.  The interceptor is in a Grails plugin.  The Grails 3 upgrade is done, and when I copy and paste the code into an app (just to verify it works), then I see the output from the interceptor.  </p>  <p>However, if I try to pull in that code through a plugin to the app, the interceptors do not run. I can verify that the plugin is being pulled; its interceptors are just not being invoked when I hit an action.  </p>  <p>For example if the plugin is:</p>  <pre><code>// If added to app directly, works fine. As plugin, not invoked. class SimpleInterceptor {     SimpleInterceptor() {         matchAll()     }      boolean before() {       println 'test' // Does not print if using plugin     } } </code></pre>  <p>And the controller is a simple action:</p>  <pre><code>def index() {    render 'success' } </code></pre>  <p>Do I need to register it somehow in order for the interceptor to work on apps?  Am I missing a step?  </p>
