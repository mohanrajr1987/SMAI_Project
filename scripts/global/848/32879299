<p>After building project in Grails 2.5.1 reloading is not working. After some changes in controller, service or in my own groovy classes, I've to restart the application to see the changes. I've used this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18882589/grails-2-3-0-auto-reloading-not-working">answer</a>, but having the same behaviour.</p>  <p>In the console I'm getting an error- </p>  <pre><code>plugins.AbstractGrailsPluginManager - Plugin [controllers:2.5.1] could not reload changes to file [***.groovy]: Cannot get property 'cacheOperationSource' on null object. </code></pre>  <p>Have any ideas?</p>
