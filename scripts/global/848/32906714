<p>I'm trying Grails 3.0.8 for the first time. I'll use it to create web-services for mobile development. </p>  <p>I already have a mysql database with a lot of tables. I found that I can use "db-reverse-engineer:0.5.1" to generate the different domains from the tables. For some reason, I cannot install the plugin and it doesn't work. I think it has something to do with the new version of Grails which is 3.0.8. </p>  <p>As there are not a lot of documentation on this version, I was wondering if there was a way to generate domains from an existing MySQL database. </p>  <p>If not, is it possible to use the database without having to create domains for the tables?</p>
