<p>Hello:) I have server with map that supports format of KVP queries. But when I use tiles from this map I have problem with location of tiles because I don't know how many tilerow and tilecol my map has and I can't locate them correct. There's 3 parameters in query:</p>  <pre><code> TILEMATRIX=%1&amp;TILEROW=%2&amp;TILECOL=%3 </code></pre>  <p>And I need to know how many tiles my map have. There must be a query (I think) that returns value of <code>TILEROW</code> and <code>TILECOL</code> for every map but I can't find something about it in web. Maybe someone knows what I can do with that.</p>
