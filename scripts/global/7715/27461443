<p>In Java (Android), I have a bunch of records that are keyed by unique dates.  They are also sorted based on increasing date. The user is meant to add to this collection.</p>  <p>I need to do be able to do the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Lookup these records directly by date</li> <li>Lookup these records directly by index</li> <li>Insert a new record (with unique date) anywhere, including between two existing records, and thus, adjusting the indexes of all affected records.</li> </ol>  <p>Some implementation details --</p>  <p>These records will be sorted in increasing order by date (newest at the end).</p>  <p>These records will also be displayed in reverse-order (newest date at the top) in an Android ListView, thus non-linear, direct access to the index is required.</p>  <p>These records will also be plotted based on a date that may or may not exist in the database, thus direct lookup by date is required.</p>  <p>I haven't been able to find an existing solution that addresses these requirements.</p>  <p>What's the best way to accomplish this?</p>
