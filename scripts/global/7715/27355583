<p>I have an object with double keys and object values, e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>var animation = {     0.0: position1,     0.1: position2,     0.4: position3,     ... } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to know the ceiling and the floor key for a given value. e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>ceilingKey(animation, 0.3) //should return 0.1 floorKey(animation, 0.3) //should return 0.4 </code></pre>  <p>I am open to any solution (e.g. the doubles don't necessary have to be object keys, they can even be a separate array).</p>  <p>The only solution I can think of is to iterate through the doubles and return when reached the celing/floor key (or to do a binary search if the doubles are in a separate array). Is there any more elegant solution?</p>
