<p>This is my code to work with <code>OpenLayers.js</code>:</p>  <pre><code>var tehLayer = new ol.layer.Tile({         source: new ol.source.XYZ({             url: 'http://example.com/{z}/{x}_{y}.png'         })     });      var view = new ol.View({         maxResolution: 64,         projection: 'EPSG:4326',         maxZoom: 8,         center: [534183, 3950813.5],          zoom: 0     });       var map = new ol.Map({         target: 'map',         projection: 'EPSG:4326',         layers: [tehLayer],         view: view     }); </code></pre>  <p>Actually, this code has worked fine in OpenLayers Version2, for some reasons I'm trying to use Version3, but now the thing is <code>{z},{y}</code> and <code>{x}</code> are calculated wrong! I expect the value of <code>{z}</code> will be between 0 and 8 but it starts from 11! I wonder if I have any mistakes in the code.</p>
