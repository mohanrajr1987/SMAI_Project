<p>I have developed an android application that uses the mapsforge library to display the offline map and the offline map is in .map of osm map of my area. Now I need to get all the hospitals location in my map so that I can calculate the route to the hospitals using graphhopper? Can Anybody suggest how to select the hospitals from my map or Do I need to use any other methods?</p>
