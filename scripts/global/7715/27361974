<p>I want to use TMap. My tMap component takes two sources( both Impala tables) and it performs some simple transformations.</p>  <p>The output of the tmap has columns like id, datetime, and some other columns.</p>  <p>I want to perform an operation like </p>  <pre><code>select * from ( select *, row_number() over (partition by id order by datetime desc) as seq) temp where temp.seq= 1 ) final </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way I can use this in tmap itself? or any other step/component before or after tmap too is fine.</p>  <p>I just want to get this working, and not thinking of an optimized approach right now.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
