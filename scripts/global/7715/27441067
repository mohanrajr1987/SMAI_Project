<p>diving further into kivy, i began to wonder what map options were available (either google maps or something like open street maps). What i found so far:</p>  <p><strong>KivyMaps</strong> <a href="https://github.com/relet/kivyMaps" rel="nofollow">link</a> So far the most usefull Module i found. It is supposed to work on mac, windows, android and iOS (experimental), BUT: i don't find the docs anywhere! I googled a lot, still i have not a clue how to use kivyMaps</p>  <p><strong>Kivy Mapview</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kivy-garden/garden.mapview" rel="nofollow">link</a> Available trough garden. Good docs, but they say it works only on android. For me, it does work on Kivy + Mac, at least displaying and moving the map. Setting coordinates and changing them does not.</p>  <p>So i guess my question is: What do you use? Are there other options available that i missed? Where are the KivyMaps docs (can somebody provide examples?)</p>
