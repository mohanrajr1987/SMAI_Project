<p>I'm making a code were you create a wordlist. It contains a 'word' and a 'describtion'. The word and describtion has their own vectors. I'm trying the same by using maps too.</p>  <p>The program is going well untill I try to lookup the words. The program will only take the last word from the describtion. Is there a way to make a whole sentence to a single vector?</p>  <p>This is the code on how I write down the describtion. The whole program code is really long so I'll mention only the important stuff:</p>  <pre><code>cout&lt;&lt; "Describe your word:"; //Describtion by using vectors cin&gt;&gt; desc;         //Here you enter the decribtion getline(cin, desc); //So you can have "space" and write a whole sentence. d.push_back(desc);  //Place the describe at the back of the list so it is at the same index as the matching word </code></pre>  <p>And this is the code that is supposed to show the word and describtion:</p>  <pre><code>cout&lt;&lt; "Enter a word to lookup:"; cin&gt;&gt; word; if (find(o.begin(), o.end(), word) !=o.end())   //Lookup if word excist in vector {     int pos = find(o.begin(), o.end(), word) - o.begin();   //Searches which index the word is in the vector     cout&lt;&lt; "Describtion for " &lt;&lt; word &lt;&lt; " is " &lt;&lt; d[pos] &lt;&lt; endl;  //d[pos] takes the description vector that is in the same index as the word vector } else     cout&lt;&lt; "Word not found! Try something else." &lt;&lt; endl;   //If word not found </code></pre>  <p>It will only take the last word from the describtion. I got the same problem by using maps:</p>  <pre><code>cout&lt;&lt; "Enter a word to lookup:";  cin&gt;&gt; word; if (L.find(word) != L.end())    //Lookup if the key excist {     cout&lt;&lt; "Describtion for " &lt;&lt; word &lt;&lt; " is " &lt;&lt; L[word] &lt;&lt; endl; //Tells what the description is for the word if it excist } else     cout&lt;&lt; "Word not found! Try something else." &lt;&lt; endl;   //Tells you this if key is not found </code></pre>  <p>So, how can I get the whole describtion printed out for the specific word?</p>  <p>edit: I noticed that it's only the first word in the describtion that's missing (I'm stupid enough to not try with more words than 2)</p>  <p>So, what is wrong? How can I get the frist word in the describtion appere in the output?</p>
