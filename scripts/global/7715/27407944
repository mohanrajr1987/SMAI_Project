<p>I need to click an image map object and have it toggle to show/hide a sidebar(currently functioning on a button that i want to get rid of). I will use different pieces of this image to page jump on this sidebar to their respective sections as it is a form. I will take the output form this form and print it on a final page.</p>  <p>Is it possible to use a link outside of the sidebar that will make the sidebar itself jump?</p>  <p>This is for a final project due tomorrow, and I have asked multiple resources without avail.</p>  <p>Thanks so much in advance!</p>  <p>-Garrett</p>
