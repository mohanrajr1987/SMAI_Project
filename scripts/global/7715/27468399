<p>I use CodeKit for minifying js files. It creates somename.map files for the each minified js file. So when I open chrome debugger, it tells me a correct line of the error in the original js file, not inside a minified one.</p>  <p>There's a link to a .map file at the end of the each minified file. I'm not sure when browser loads a map file for js. </p>  <p>Does this happen in IE or Firefox by default, or Chrome?</p>
