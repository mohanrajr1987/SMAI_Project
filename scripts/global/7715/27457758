<p>I can't seem to get any image maps to work on my wordpress site. I have tried inserting an image map via the HTML code that image-maps.com provides (pasted directly into the Wordpress post HTML editor), and all I get is the image (no clickable areas)...even though the HTML output result on image-maps gives me a working image map. </p>  <p>I have also downloaded an image map plugin and inserted the map via shortcode, but again, all I get is the image, no clickable areas. </p>  <p>I tried switching themes, thinking it might be my particular theme, but I still have the problem.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>I know some people have said to make sure only 1 map tag is used (vs. individual map tags added for each area), which I have made sure is the case, but still, not working! :\</p>
