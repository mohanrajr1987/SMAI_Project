<p>I'm fairly new to C++, I've tried to figure this out on my own but can't quite get there.</p>  <p>I've defined a map of pointers to a group of dynamically allocated objects in one class, with strings as the keys, along with two iterators (begin() and end()), and two getter functions corresponding to each iterator.</p>  <pre><code>class a{     std::map&lt;string, Fruit*&gt; fruitSalad;    std::map&lt;string, Fruit*&gt;::iterator begin = fruitSalad.begin(), end = fruitSalad.end();     std::map&lt;string, Fruit*&gt;::iterator getBeginIter() const;     std::map&lt;string, Fruit*&gt;::iterator getEndIter() const;  }; </code></pre>  <p>the objects referenced in the map, and their member functions need to be accessible in a separate driver class. To test my implementation I've been trying to print values from the objects with a for loop, by accessing the iterators via their accessors, as shown in the code below.</p>  <pre><code>#include "a.h"  int main(){     A fruitBowl;     std::map&lt;string, Object*&gt;::iterator iter;     for(iter = fruitBowl.getBeginIter(); iter != fruitBowl.getEndIter(); iter++){        cout &lt;&lt; iter.getName() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; iter.getQuantity() &lt;&lt; endl;    } } </code></pre>  <p>But I am getting the following error</p>  <pre><code>error: 'std::map&lt;std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;, Fruit*&gt;:: iterator' has no member named getName()  error: 'std::map&lt;std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;, Fruit*&gt;:: iterator' has no member named getQuantity() </code></pre>  <p>I assume I'm doing something wrong with the assignment of the iterators in my driver class, but what exactly am I doing wrong?</p>
