<p>I am currently plotting a digital signal in Qt with <code>QCustomPlot</code> but it seems that when the number of samples is greater than 10000000 the operation becomes very slow. I have a <code>time</code> vector and a <code>data</code> vector and I'm setting the data like this:</p>  <pre><code>QCustomPlot *plot; QCPGraph *graph; graph-&gt;setData(time, data);  </code></pre>  <p>Any chance to make this more efficient?</p>
