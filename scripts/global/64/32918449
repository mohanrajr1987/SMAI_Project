<p>I have a huge memory leak that always results in “low memory” errors and blue screens, so I decided to investigate with poolmoon. I have found that the nonpaged Tag “VadS” is always consuming a lot of memory, problem is that I don’t really know where this is in my computer. How can I find it so I can delete it?  I have tried some commands, but haven’t found anything that helps so far.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>  <p><img src="http://s18.postimg.org/4i0l3soh5/Command.jpg" alt="Searching with *sys and with command prompt yielded no result"></p>  <p><img src="http://s18.postimg.org/debd7qf3d/Poolmoon.jpg" alt="Poolmoon screenshot"></p>
