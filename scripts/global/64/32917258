<p>My colleague and I are trying to figure out a way to close any window open on our Windows computer (Example: close notepad; close johndoe.txt in notepad). We have been experimenting with enumWindows/enumChildWindows and FindWindows/FindWindowsEx to some degree of success. </p>  <p>Overall, we've reached a point where we're somewhat stuck. I have a working version of enumWindows that gives a list of all my top level windows, but that does not work on his computer. If anyone can help us down the right direction with obtaining a list of windows open on a computer that would be appreciated! </p>  <p>Code is welcomed!</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
