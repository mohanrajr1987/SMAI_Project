<p>I want to pass the parameters that was used to another program (ie. game was launched game.exe -parameter1, and I want to use that parameter somewhere else, ie. program.exe -parameter1). The problem is, I don't know what are those parameters and I want to forward or sniff every one of them. Any advices? Maybe there is some kind of Task manager which shows launch parameters?</p>
