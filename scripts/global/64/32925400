<p>This is what Im talking about <a href="http://i.imgur.com/29N7C.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/29N7C.jpg</a></p>  <p>On my PC the same thing appears, but the only difference is that it lists more devices (I have 5 HDDs in my PC and 1 SSD). Is there a way to skip this process? (maybe until after boot up?). </p>  <p>What Im trying to do is have my PC boot as fast as it can. Do you have any other suggestions on what else I can do, to "speed" up booting time?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance,</p>  <p>yours and yours only</p>
