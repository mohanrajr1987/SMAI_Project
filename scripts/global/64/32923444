<p>I started "using" Grunt.js yesterday, it seems to nest extensively deep folder structures in my projects, that look something like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>assets\bootstrap\node_modules\grunt-contrib-jshint\node_modules\jshint\node_modules\cli\node_modules\glob\node_modules\minimatch\node_modules\brace-expansion\node_modules\balanced-match\Makefile</p> </blockquote>  <p>This still is a realtively short path, but there are loads of paths generated which my PC (running Windows 7) simply <strong>can't handle</strong>. I see this a well known issue as you can read in this Github issue of Node.js from 2014:</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/6960#issuecomment-46704998" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/6960#issuecomment-46704998</a></p>  <p>However the issue still isn't fixed and a lot of people seem to be mad about it. I wonder if I should get my head around Grunt at all because I didn't see a solid solution to get this working for me so far.</p>  <p>Even if I started using Mac (assumed Grunt.js works fine on mac), from my point of view Grunt seems to be a bad option if you want to be able to collaborate with people using windows.</p>  <p><strong>Is there an easy way to use Gruntjs without running into file path issues on Windows?</strong></p>
