<p>So my hard drive crashed. Acer laptop said "No operating system found" out of nowhere on a reboot. The drive can't be found in boot settings and connecting it to a working PC via an enclosure does not work at all. Dead drive.</p>  <p>I have an old laptop with Windows 7 installed. The dead drive had Win 7 Pro, the old laptop has Win 7 Home. The old laptop is physically dead, although the drive is fine. Connecting that drive to working PC via enclosure works fine.</p>  <p>If I plug the working drive directly intomy laptop with the dead drive, I actually get to my old laptops login screen and am able to login. However the desktop is just a black screen. CTRL + ALT + DELETE does work though.</p>  <p>My question is how do I get this drive working? I was going to wipe it and download the windows 7 pro .iso, however I can't find it anywhere. The official windows site just says "We encountered an error during your request", when I use the product key on the bottom my dead drive laptop. I haven't tried the old laptop product key.</p>  <p>Since I can't seem to boot off this drive correctly I don't know what other options I have. I read about ways to force windows to boot up as if it is first time setup in order to get all the drivers and everything working but I can't get to that since I cannot boot off the drive.</p>  <p>How would you handle this?</p>
