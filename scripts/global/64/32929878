<p>I have created a batch file to help me write a script for an application I have on my phone that will automate touch tasks. The script Iam creating will require 240x9 lines of the scripting language to complete the tasks I am wanting to complete, is there a way to open a new cmd line and output text to the new window?</p>  <p>So for instance right now I have each option in the batch file to write the screen touch coordinates required by the scripting language to execute my tasks out to a text file like this.</p>  <pre><code>@ECHO :start&gt;speedsearch.txt </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to pass these to a new window just to use it as a live log so if I loose my place I can refer to the log window to remind myself where I am in the creation of my script?</p>
