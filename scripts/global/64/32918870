<p>I have upgraded my pc to windows 10. But i am getting "cookies must be allowed" error while logging into windows mail or gmail accounts using microsoft edge. Everything is working fine in other browsers but edge is giving me trouble. I have already set "don't block cookies " in browsers settings . </p>
