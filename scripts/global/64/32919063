<p>In Linux, we have the Root account, which is the highest possible privilege, and you can virtually do anything with that account. You can delete the entire OS with one command, and the kernel won't care. Windows on the other hand, is very complicated. An account belonging to the  Administrators group can only do so much. Even as admin, I cannot access certain files, or change certain parameters. (Like browse a hidden folder in the hidden $RECYCLE.BIN folder). I cannot delete certain files (system32 stuff), and some dude who calls himself "Trusted Installer" owns most of MY OS. Is there a privilege level like root, that's higher than the Administrators group, that I can use to bypass all kernel level restrictions and ownership parameters? I need to do certain things that require a privilege level that's through the roof. </p>
