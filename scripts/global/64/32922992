<p>I am working on a C# winforms Desktop application. The application has two processes. Users need to invoke only first process and first process will invoke the second process. The first process makes all web service calls to get the data and stores on local database. The second application is UI based and show data that is there in the local database. I am using SQL Server 2008 R2 Express for local database.</p>  <p>This model works fine when the user clicks on the desktop icon or invokes from start menu. But my requirement is to start the application at windows startup. So I put the shortcut to first application in windows startup. In this case I see SQL exception for the database calls made on the second process saying Login failed for user <code>sa</code>. </p>  <p>The code for starting the second process is as below called from Form Load of 1st process</p>  <pre><code>string MAIN_APP = "second.exe"; System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(MAIN_APP); GetDataFromServer(); </code></pre>  <p>I do not have any clue why it works when invoked from desktop and fails in startup. I tried setting user context as administrator in application manifest but that is not solving the issue. </p>  <p>Any pointers on what could be wrong?</p>  <p>Code on the second application are as below:</p>  <pre><code>try {     string sqlStr = "select remember_pass, imgfile from user_profile where  userid = '" + txtUserId.Text + "'";     DataSet ds = new DataSet();      SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(mainConnectionString)     SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(str, con);     da.Fill(ds); } catch(Exception ex) {    logger.log("Caught Exception. Reason {0}", ex.Message); } </code></pre>  <p>Note: I rectified the mistakes in the problem statement.</p>
