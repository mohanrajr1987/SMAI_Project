<p>I was testing out how the mic exactly works on my new HP 15 with Windows 10 laptop. There's only one place where you can hook up headphones and can be used with a communication headset with the mic and all, non-USB. I was fiddling around with the settings of the panels cause it was too quiet on the other end (I was making a Skype call to my boyfriend and he said it was too quiet), the Windows panel and the panel of the soundcard driver. It's an Realtek driver and the panel for the Realtex driver is DTS Studio Sound. So, I hit this setting on the DTS panel and it's called, "Enable playback multi-streaming" and put it from disabled to enable, when I done that my laptop started to install another thing and created an extra speaker for a headset. So, I tried to get rid of what my laptop done by rollbacking the driver, that did not fix the problem, in fact I couldn't use my headphones at all when it was plugged in, I had to disable the main speakers in the Windows control panel (not DTS) so that I could use the headphones. My boyfriend could hear me better. But, I had a issue with the way the speakers were going and I no longer had the DTS panel. So, I updated the driver back to its Realtek driver. When I done that I had the DTS panel back. But, the issue was not fixed, when I hit the mic (there's a button) on the headphones it killed the whole Soundcard and my WiFi icon went insane, but came back. So, now I am stuck with what I did and no longer can use my headphones on my laptop. Is there anyway that I can reverse all this and put it back all to default without doing a whole system restore back to factory default? I want to be able to make a Skype call without sounding so quiet, but I need to reverse it all back to before what I done to the laptop.        </p>
