<p>I was curious how to open the system boot's safe mode in windows 10. I looked up how and did so. But after coming to the desktop screen, I immediately restarted the computer to exit safe mode. Now, Android Studio and Dr. Java won't work. Both tell me to check my firewall settings, but I tried disabling Windows Firewall and I still get the same errors. Is it possible that opening safe mode somehow moved my Java SDK and that is causing the problems?</p>
