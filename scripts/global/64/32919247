<p>So I'm on Windows, and I'm wondering how to build a DLL and a Static Library in MingW, and in different architectures like x86 and x64. I'm new to MingW, but not C++. I've been looking around Google a while and haven't found a way to do it yet, the reason being is because most of the tutorials I find are out-of-date.</p>  <p><strong>GNU 'Make' File</strong></p>  <pre><code>Sources = Test.cpp Utilities.cpp Objects = $(Sources:.cpp=.o)  ProjName = MyProgram BuildName = $(ProjName).dll  $(ProjName) : $(Objects)     g++ -o $(BuildName) $(Objects)  $(Objects) :     g++ -c -D TEST_DYNAMIC $(Sources)  Clean :     rm $(Objects) $(BuildName) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Addition Information</strong></p>  <p>Mingw Version: 4.8.1-4</p>  <p><strong>Attempts</strong></p>  <pre><code>http://www.mingw.org/wiki/sampledll  -shared is an unrecognized command. </code></pre>
