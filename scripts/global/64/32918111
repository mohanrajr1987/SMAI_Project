<p>When I google the title above, I get enundated with hits on "dvd drive won't detect disk", or "DVD won't read disk", etc etc.</p>  <p>The problem is the drive will not detect that the disk has CHANGED.  I ejected one disk, inserted another, and the system (windows explorer) still thinks the previous disk is in the drive, and the drive in "My Computer" is still showing the title of the previous disk.</p>  <p>I get around this by going to device manager and completely uninstalling the DVD drive.  It immediately detects the new device and reinstalls the driver for it.  Then when I put in a new disk, it reads it and displays the correct title.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
