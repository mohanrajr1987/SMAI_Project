<p>I host a site on a Linux server that I built with php where I am able to upload audio files in one section and video files to another. Each section uses php to upload a single audio file and a single video file. Each upload is assigned a unique filename so they can be viewed separately on an individual page where the uploader can post comments about their audio or video. I want to be able to allow musicians and performers in the local area display their work.  The site works, but large video files do not upload and my audio player only plays a few formats, and I like to convert them all to mp3's.  I installed ffmpeg on my linux server to help me with this and am able to connect to it with my terminal.  My question is how do I get ffmpeg to interface with my uploaded php files. For example, as the user uploads an audio file, can I have ffmpeg convert it while it's uploading, or do I need to set up a temporary folder for uploads, store it there, then have ffmpeg compress the file, convert it to a specific format and save it in another folder? I would prefer to have it compress and change the format while it's uploading so as not to use server space, but if this is not the way ffmpeg works, then I don't have a choice.  Any help would be appreciated. </p>
