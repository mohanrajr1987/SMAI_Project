<p>I am working on x264. I would like to ask one of the old questions related to h.264 MVC 3D. I have read many threads, most of them say there is no open source support for h.264 3d and the technology is dead.</p>  <p>I would like to ask the experts here about there opinion</p>  <p>-Is h.264 MVC 3D support added to any opensource codecs like ffmpeg/x264.</p>  <p>-If its not supported in x264, How can I add 3D support to x264.</p>  <p>-How can I proceed, can I take x264 source code and make changes according to the JM of H.264.</p>  <p>-Is there any open source 3D decoder available.</p>  <p>NOTE: Please don't mark this question as duplicate, as all the answers I found were answered in 2010-2012 and hoping many things have been changed by now. Thanks in advance.</p>
