<p>I would like to use ffmpeg to record my desktop as well as my camera as an overlay on top of the desktop.</p>  <p>So basically I will have two input sources that need to be recorded</p>  <pre><code>$ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i '' [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fded1c223e0] AVFoundation video devices: [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fded1c223e0] [0] FaceTime HD Camera [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fded1c223e0] [1] Capture screen 0 [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fded1c223e0] AVFoundation audio devices: [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fded1c223e0] [0] Built-in Microphone </code></pre>  <p>From the above, I need [0] FaceTime HD Camera as an overlay and [1] Capture screen 0 as the main video.</p>  <p>Is this even possible?</p>
