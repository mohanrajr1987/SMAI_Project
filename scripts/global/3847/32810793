<p>I'm using kdenlive 9.6 on Ubuntu, and would like to render videos for display on an iPad.</p>  <p>I've tried using H.264 Profile but it won't display on an iPad.  I think this is because the profile (when I check using mp4info) is High@3.2, whereas per <a href="http://www.theipadguide.com/faq/what-video-formats-will-ipad-playsupport" rel="nofollow">this link</a> this should be max Main@3.1 to support iPad.</p>  <p>Does anyone have profile settings I can paste in to get it to render in Main/3.1 please?</p>
