<p>I have 100 images need to convert to mp4 video, the length of video is 30s. In that time, i have 2 audio files need to be played.</p>  <p>Audio 1: should play from 5s to 15s, and audio length is 1 minute. And i want to play from 00:30 of that audio.</p>  <p>Audio 2: playing from 20s to 30s, and audio length is 10s, the same with time that i want to play in video. But i want to increase volume when start(from 0 to 1) and decrease volume when ended(from 1 to 0).</p>  <p>Do you have any idea of FFmpeg command to execute it?</p>  <p>[For example: image named: image_001.jpg, image_002.jpg ..... image_100.jpg, and audios: audio1.mp3, audio2.mp3]</p>  <p>Here is current FFmpeg comment that i use to convert mp4 file: ffmpeg -start_number 0 -i image_%03d.jpg -c:v libx264 -t 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p video.mp4</p>  <p>Thank for your help.</p>  <p>Regard, Cuong.Tran</p>
