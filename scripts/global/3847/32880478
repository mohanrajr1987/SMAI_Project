<p>Webcam lets others view either still pictures or motion video of a user or other object in front of it. I want to configure Webcam in a way that it start capturing desktop screen instead of what is in front of it.</p>  <p>I want to manipulate desktop screen captured through Webcam using FFMPEG library. Such as:</p>  <pre><code>ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="Integrated Webcam" -f mp4 cam_stream.mp4 </code></pre>  <p>I want to use this same application to capture my Desktop Screen that will be possible just in that case when Webcam will be able to capture my Desktop Screen instead. So above command will start recording what Webcam will be capturing that I want it to capture my desktop screen.</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I know other ways to capture, record or stream desktop screen but I want to achieve it through Webcam.</p>  <p><strong>What I tried so far:</strong> I tried some Fake/Virtual Webcam software (manycam, sparkocam etc.) but I don't think they fulfil what I exactly want.</p>  <p><strong>P.S.</strong> I posted the same <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/980196/capture-and-record-desktop-screen-with-as-webcam-video">question</a> in another <a href="http://superuser.com/">community</a> but didn't get any response.</p>  <p>Please guide me if there is any way to achieve this? Thanks</p>
