<p>I am in the process of developing an application which could something like do a webcasting of audio video</p>  <p>I want to make use of node JS  And ffmpeg. my question is can I use Ffmpeg to convert vp8       video stream in to H.264   or other stream formats </p>  <p>some more information the audio video stream will be coming from the user who will be using Chrome browser using webrtc hence the stream will be vp8 format</p>
