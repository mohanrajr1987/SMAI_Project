<p>I'm using this project to build FFmpeg: <a href="https://github.com/WritingMinds/ffmpeg-android" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/WritingMinds/ffmpeg-android</a>. All other building guides didn't work for me.</p>  <p>When I try to concat videos - some videos are being concated well and some are not. However when I use the same ffmpeg-command on my PC - all videos are being concated without any troubles. So I guess the problem is with my ffmpeg binary. Where can I download pre-built fresh ffmpeg binary (ffmpeg.so) to test if it's the real problem?</p>  <p>Api level 16+, cpu arm/x86</p>
