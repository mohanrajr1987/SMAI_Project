<p>Im trying to overlay a smaller video (200x200)on top of a bigger video (800x800).</p>  <p>I've used the FFMPEG overlay filter to achieve this</p>  <pre><code>    ffmpeg -i big.mp4 -vf "movie=small.mkv[clip2]; [in][clip2] overlay=1:5 [out]"  final.mp4 </code></pre>  <p>Challenge is that the smaller video needs its edges to be rounded. I have tried working with alphaextract and alphamerge. The documentation on FFMPEG is sparse and im not sure how to go about it. </p>
