<p>I am using FFmpeg to insert text in a video. However I did not want it ENCODED The Full Video . Just as I want the text to be inserted at 20 seconds, then I want to stop coding. Since I'll encode several videos a day. I just need to add the text and do NOT need to to read entire video.</p>  <p>Next I use the command , only that it encodes the Full Video .</p>  <pre><code>ffmpeg -i original.mp4 -strict experimental -vf "drawtext=fontfile='/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf':text='Liberado para Celso':x=500:y=10:fontsize=9" saida3.mp4 </code></pre>  <p>I believe I don't need to generate a MP4 as output, just that it inserts the text and be fast!</p>
