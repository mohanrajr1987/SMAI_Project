<p>I don't really have any experience cross compiling so there is probably a simple solution to my problem.  I downloaded libogg 1.3.1 from <a href="http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/libogg-1.3.1.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/libogg-1.3.1.tar.gz</a> and libtheora from <a href="http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.1.tar.bz2" rel="nofollow">http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.1.tar.bz2</a>.  First I compile and libogg using these commands (in MSYS, when in the extracted directory):</p>  <pre><code>./configure --prefix=/usr/local/x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --disable-static make clean &amp;&amp; make -j4 make install </code></pre>  <p>and it looks like everything works (no errors reported and I see libogg files in /usr/local/x86_64-w64-mingw32).</p>  <p>I also compile and install libvorbis and libSDL with similar commands (downloads found in links on <a href="http://www.theora.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theora.org/downloads/</a>)</p>  <p>I then try to compile libtheora and it fails at the configure.  Here is the command I run:</p>  <pre><code>./configure --prefix=/usr/local/x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --disable-static </code></pre>  <p>and the result is an error about not finding the libogg library (below is the end of the configure output):</p>  <pre><code>checking for OGG... no checking for Ogg... no *** Could not run Ogg test program, checking why... *** The test program failed to compile or link. See the file config.log for the *** exact error that occured. This usually means Ogg was incorrectly installed *** or that you have moved Ogg since it was installed. configure: error:     libogg is required to build this package!     please see http://www.xiph.org/ for how to     obtain a copy. </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone have any thoughts on what I am doing wrong?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>David</p>
