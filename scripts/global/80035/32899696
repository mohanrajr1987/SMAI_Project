<p><br> I'm quite a newbie to Xamarin as well as Android programming.<br> I have a problem with Spinner widget. It used to work fine as a normal widget when embedded in AXML file.<br> Now I need to create and show it on the fly at runtime and I called PerformClick() method. It shows properly but ItemSelected() event is not firing. I tried googling for two days but no luck.<br> You can refer my code example below.<br> I appreciate your help.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <pre><code>protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle) {     ...      Spinner spinnerPipeIDColumn1 = new Spinner(this, SpinnerMode.Dialog);     spinnerPipeIDColumn1.SetBackgroundResource(Resource.Drawable.EditTextStyle);     spinnerPipeIDColumn1.ItemSelected += (s, e) =&gt;     {          Toast.MakeText(this, "Hey", ToastLength.Long).Show();     };      ... } </code></pre>
