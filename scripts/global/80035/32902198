<p>I have simple grid and image in it. I want to handle tap on the image by command. Here is some XAML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Grid Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="2" Grid.ColumnSpan="3" BackgroundColor="Purple"&gt; &lt;Image  Source="danger.jpg" &gt;     &lt;Image.GestureRecognizers&gt;         &lt;TapGestureRecognizer Command="{Binding DangerCommand}" /&gt;     &lt;/Image.GestureRecognizers&gt; &lt;/Image&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>When I run app on Android I catch my tap not only on the image but outside it in this grid cell (this behavior which I'd like to have). But when I run it on WindowsPhone - I catch tap directly on my image. How can I make the same behavior as on Android?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
