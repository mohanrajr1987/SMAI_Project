<p>I am constantly getting <code>NameResolutionFailure</code> errors when I make web requests (GET) in my MVVM Cross Android app.</p>  <p>I've tried out much of the advice provided in forums re this issue as it's a common one but I am unable to fix this.</p>  <p>My current attempt uses the NuGet package <code>ModernHttpClient</code> to perform web requests. The same error occurs - unable to resolve the domain to an IP - however the error message is slightly different from what was happening when I was using <code>HttpWebRequest</code> so I guess thats a slight improvement?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>java.net.UnknownHostException: Unable to resolve host "jsonplaceholder.typicode.com": No address associated with hostname</p> </blockquote>  <p>Can you provide advice on why this is always failing? Maybe its my method thats not truely utilising <code>ModernHttpClient</code>?</p>  <p>The following code is part of my <code>IRestService</code> class located in the <code>Core</code> PCL and not in the Android project.</p>  <pre><code>public async Task MakeRequest(WebHeaderCollection headers = null) {      var handler = new NativeMessageHandler();     string requestUrl = "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1";      try     {         using (var client = new HttpClient(handler))         {             //client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseAddress);             client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));              var response = await client.GetAsync(requestUrl);              if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)             {                 var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();                 var reader = new StreamReader(stream);                 Mvx.Trace("Stream: {0}", reader.ReadToEnd());             }         }     }     catch (WebException ex)     {         Mvx.Trace("MakeRequest Error: '{0}'", ex.Message);     }      return; } </code></pre>  <p><em>PS:</em> I have also attempted to use Cheesebarons ModernHttpClient MVVM Cross plugin but this is causing compile errors in release mode and there is no documentation about what methods and classes it has - maybe its not supported anymore?</p>  <p><em>PPS:</em> And yes my manifest has internet permission (I check the options and the actual manifest file to confirm)</p>
