<p>I have the following code to try connect the authenticator</p>  <pre><code>        var auth = new OAuth2Authenticator (             appId,             "email",             new Uri ("https://m.facebook.com/dialog/oauth/"),             new Uri ("http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html")); </code></pre>  <p>and when the dialog shows, I can see that it is requesting permission to see my email. But how do I get that email from the service?</p>  <p>I make the following call to get the Facebook ID</p>  <pre><code>var request = new OAuth2Request ("GET", new Uri ("https://graph.facebook.com/me"), null, args.Account);                 request.GetResponseAsync ().ContinueWith (t =&gt; {                     var obj = JsonValue.Parse (t.Result.GetResponseText ());                     var id = obj ["id"];                 }); </code></pre>  <p>But there is no email in the reponse that I get back. How can I get the email address of the user?</p>
