<p>Im working on an app build on Xamarin ios that will connect to MS Dynamics CRM 2015 (Online). I have some issues setting up the Connection to CRM. I've only been using console apps earlier by using the OrganizationServiceProxy - but when i try to set that up in my Xamarin Project it gives me this error : "Type type 'ClientCredentials' is defined in an assembly that is not refrenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.ServiceModel, version=4.0.0.0 ... "  The System.Servicemodel i find in my Xamarin framework is of version 2.0 .. I'm wondering how i could make this work. </p>  <p>Should i download a higher version of system.servicemodel or should i use some other way to connect to CRM, Like ADAL?</p>
