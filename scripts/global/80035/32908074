<p>When developing client application was faced with the following problem ... I use System.Net.Sockets.Socket. Protocol - TCP. Client app detects lost connection on desktop computer, but client app does not detect lost connection on Android phone. Also client app on Android phone does not detect a valid shutdown from server. CS the code of client app is exactly the same on desktop computer as and Android phone. Losing connection i trying keep track of two different ways: 1) using KeepAlive; 2) sending zero-byte. client app on Android does not responds as using socket in blocking mode, and non-blocking mode. The socket is always connected. Exceptions do not appear. Who knows what could be the reason? Perhaps somebody already faced a similar problem and knows ways to solve.</p>
