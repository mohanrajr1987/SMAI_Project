<p>I am trying to create horizontal scroll list. Multiple forums recommended writing a custom renderer since there does not exists one. My final output is something like <a href="http://screencast.com/t/EmYDo1pE" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>  <p>Each element in the scroll list is within a grid. The elements cannot be selected by tapping on them like listview. <strong>Anything between the lines is selected</strong>. So the structure of layout would be something like this to give you a rough idea</p>  <pre><code>HorizontalViewList   StackLayout     Grid1       item1     Grid2       item2 </code></pre>  <p>To mark an element selected I basically take the x,y coordinates of the element and match it with the x,y coordinate of the two line. Currently I was only taking one case which is when the element x,y is less than the x,y of the line (I know there are other possibilities, but I wanted to get one thing working). My problem is I am not able to get the x,y coordinates of the grid (which is inside the scroll list) wrt to the screen.</p>  <p>Here is my code of the above logic</p>  <pre><code>protected void OnElementPropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e) {     if (this.cList != null)      {         var stackLayoutChild = this.cList.Content as StackLayout;          if (stackLayoutChild != null)          {             int childCount = 0;             foreach (Grid child in stackLayoutChild.Children)              {                 var positionXStart = child.X;                 var positionXEnd = child.X + child.Width;                 var gridChild = child.Children [0] as Label;                  if (positionXStart &gt; selectionBoundXStart &amp;&amp; positionXEnd &lt; selectionBoundXEnd)                  {                     this.cList.SelectedItemIndex = childCount;                                          System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine ("Selected item is " + gridChild.Text);                                         break;                                                       }                                     ++childCount;             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>The code to detect selectionBoundXStart and selectionBoundXEnd is something like this during the Draw of the ScrollViewRenderer selectionBoundXStart = this.GetX () + mid oint - 30; selectionBoundXEnd = this.GetX () + midpoint + 30;</p>  <p>I am new to mobile development in general. Here are some questions</p>  <ol> <li>What are X, Y that are properties of grid? Are they wrt to screen or layout?</li> <li>What are the GetX and GetY functions on the ScrollViewRenderer. I tried even GetLocationInWindow. The coordinates matched with GetX and GetY</li> <li>Is there an easier way to achieve this? It is quite possible I am going the wrong route of writing my own renderer.</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks for the help</p>
