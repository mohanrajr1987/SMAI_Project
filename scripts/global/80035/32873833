<p>In the Xamarin Forms files, I have an interface with a method: GetCurrentLocation, and two properties (both strings): latitude and longitude. </p>  <p>In the Xamarin iOS files, I have a class interfacing from previously mentioned interface. The method (now expounded upon) states that, upon activation, it creates a MKMapView, get's the User's lat. and long., and sets them to equal to the lat. and long. properties of the class (As shown below).</p>  <pre><code>    public string latitude { get; set; }     public string longitude { get; set; }     public void GetCurrentLocation () {         var vm = new MKMapView();         latitude = mv.UserLocation.Coordinate.Latitude.ToString();         longitude = mv.UserLocation.Coordinate.Longitude.ToString();     } </code></pre>  <p>For this example, this method will only be called upon once, and the purpose is simply to get the lat. and long. of the device and display it in text. </p>  <p>(After some dependency-service shenanigans...) Back inside the Xamarin Forms files, I have a page in which I call the method to get the location, then use the newly acquired coordinates to display the device's current location in text. (I did set a custom location in the simulator, btw.)</p>  <p>Now, my prob is that when I actually run the program, the displayed string says that the lat. and long. are both 0. ("Latitude = 0, Longitude = 0") WHYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!? ðŸ˜© <em>ultimate sad face</em></p>  <p>Anyways, I look forward to hearing back from whoever answers, thanks for the help!</p>
