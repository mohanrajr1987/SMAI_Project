<p>I installed OS X Yosemite ("Hackintosh" ) inside of Virtual Box on Windows, set the Network adapter to "Bridged Adapter" and get the Xamarin build host installed and running (as well as Xcode from the App Store), paired it up on VS2015, got it to the point of building and then it got stuck on the error message: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>1>C:\Program Files   (x86)\MSBuild\Xamarin\iOS\Xamarin.iOS.Common.targets(524,3): error :   No installed provisioning profiles match the installed iOS code   signing keys.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Started investigating into this, followed some articles where it should come to Xcode Account. I entered my Apple Id, then checked created certificates, but it never gets into download of provisioning profiles. </p>  <p>I dont intend to publish I only want to check Xamarin on the apple Iphone simulator, so can I get around to being able to do this without enrolling for paid apple developer program? </p>
