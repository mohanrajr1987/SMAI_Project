<p>I am trying to use XmlDocument class ** and **XmlDocument .Load(..) function on the Portable Project of XAMARIN.Forms Portable solution with visual studio community.</p>  <p>The compiler says that "The type or namespace name 'XmlDocument' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?"</p>  <p>If i go in References it don't allow me to add the System.XML namespace (there is no) and if i browse file and go to system.xml.dll it says me that the file could not be added because this component is already automatically referenced by build system.</p>  <p>what i can to do to use the class??</p>  <p>NOTE: in .Droid and .IOS project there is a referenc to System.xml and in those projects I can use XmlDocument class.</p>
