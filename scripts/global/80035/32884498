<p>I've got a RecyclerView with a ActionMode which can be activated by a long click on a RecyclerView item.</p>  <p>How to trigger a long click in Android with Xamarin UI tests? AndroidApp contains a method TouchAndHold(Func query) but this one seems not to trigger a long click.</p>  <p>Anyone here have a solution?</p>  <p>My code:</p>  <pre><code>   Func&lt;AppQuery, AppQuery&gt; test = c =&gt; c.Marked("Test");    app.WaitForElement (test);    app.TouchAndHold (test); </code></pre>
