<p>I'm trying to use a binding library (an Objective-C library) in my Xamarin Project. I followed all the instructions in <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c/Walkthrough_Binding_objective-c_library/" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>.</p>  <p>When I try to use it I can't find it in the edit References/Projects. What do I need to do so that it shows up?</p>
