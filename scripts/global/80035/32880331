<p>My app is using airplay. Do i need to select "Uses Bluetooth LE accessories" option in info.plist.</p>  <p>I submitted the app with checking this option and my app got rejected. Apple said that "Your app declares support for bluetooth-central in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist, but does not provide Bluetooth Low Energy functionality. The Bluetooth Background modes are for applications that communicate to other devices using Bluetooth Low Energy and the Core Bluetooth framework."</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A2Fnr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A2Fnr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
