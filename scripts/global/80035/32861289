<p>I've seen it can be done in camera configuration manager but not sure where to find that file???</p>  <p>I've added:</p>  <pre><code>          &lt;activity android:name="MainActivity"            android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"             android:screenOrientation="portrait"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And now the mainactivity is locked on portrait, but when running zxing scanner from inside activity the screen rotates during scan??</p>
