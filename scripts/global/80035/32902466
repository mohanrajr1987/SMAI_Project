<p>I'm starting to work with Xamarin.Forms for the first time. I noticed I might have an outdated version in my project though, and I can't find how to update it.</p>  <p>Looking at the NuGet gallery, the latest version is 1.5: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms/" rel="nofollow">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms/</a></p>  <p>However, in my project, I'm still using version 1.3 somehow, even though I created the project only a few days ago. Here's what the solution explorer looks like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kDNBy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kDNBy.png" alt="Solution explorer"></a></p>  <p>Xamarin Studio won't let me update the references because they are "from packages". What does that mean and how can I update?</p>
