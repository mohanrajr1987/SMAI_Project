<p>I'm trying to build a Xamarin.iOS project in Xamarin Studio. Nuget packages restoration is enabled but during any build I get the following error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>/.nuget/NuGet.targets: Error: Command 'mono --runtime=v4.0.30319   "/.nuget/NuGet.exe" install "/ProjectName/packages.config" -source ""   -RequireConsent -solutionDir "/" exited with code: 127. (ProjectName)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Running the same command from the terminal gives no issues and works absolutely fine with the following output message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Restoring NuGet packages... To prevent NuGet from downloading packages   during build, open the Visual Studio Options dialog, click on the   Package Manager node and uncheck 'Allow NuGet to download missing   packages'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>.nuget/NuGet.exe and .nuget/NuGet.targets are up to date. With the disabled nuget restore at the project .csproj file compilation works just fine.</p>  <p>Please advise.</p>
