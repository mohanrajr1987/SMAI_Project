<p>Guys</p>  <p>I'm developping an app from structure analysis in engineering and at some point I have to solve a system of equations. For that, I'm using a simple gaussian elimination method that I put together quite quickly. Problem is, since I'm dealing with a lot of fractions, sort of big and small numbers, and the matrices are relatively big (300x300 is not uncommon), there's a huge loss of accuracy in the results: there are some cases when the loss reaches the second decimal algarism. Do you guys have some insight on that? Do I have to use BigDecimal or something similar?</p>  <p>Ps.: I'm using matrices of doubles.</p>
