<p>I am trying to write a program that will allow me to do the following calculation with at least 18 digits of accuracy.</p>  <pre><code>retMin = (long)((Math.Abs(ret)+Math.Abs(retMin))*Math.Pow(-1,Math.Abs(i))); </code></pre>  <p>I believe this code would work if not for the use of the Math class which takes out puts doubles.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this without using doubles?</p>
