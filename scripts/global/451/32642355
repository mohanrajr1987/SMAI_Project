<p>I am using <code>fmincon</code> with lower bound <code>lb = [0, 0, 0]</code> and upper  bound <code>ub = [1, 1, 5]</code>.</p>  <p>For of the runs I have returned a first parameter value of <code>-2e-16</code> and other runs with second parameter values of order <code>-1e-11</code>.</p>  <p>Now, I think these values are actually equal to zero, within tolerance of floating point comparison. But I am rather disturbed that <code>fmincon</code> actually returned negative numbers.</p>  <p>Why is this happening? Is it because my bounds were not specified using integers?</p>
