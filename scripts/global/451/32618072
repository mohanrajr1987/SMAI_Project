<p>I have this chunk of code, whenever I enter any value the result always comes up as 0. I set breakpoints inside each if statement and the values being used in the calculation are always valid, but liming is still  It may also be worth noting that <code>soilDepth</code> and <code>rnv</code> are integers. I tried casting them to doubles, just in case, and nothing changed.</p>  <pre><code>final TextView limingTV = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.limingText);  double liming;  if (targetPh == 6.8) {     liming = (71.4 - 1.03 * bufferpH * 10) * (soilDepth / 8) * (65 / rnv); } else if (targetPh == 6.5) {     liming = (60.4 - .87 * bufferpH * 10) * (soilDepth / 8) * (65 / rnv); } else if (targetPh == 6.0) {     liming = (49.3 - .71 * bufferpH * 10) * (soilDepth / 8) * (65 / rnv); } else { //If 6.8 is left as default on drop down menu its not passed     liming = (71.4 - 1.03 * bufferpH * 10) * (soilDepth / 8) * (65 / rnv); }  limingTV.setText(String.format("%.4f lbs/acre", liming)); </code></pre>
