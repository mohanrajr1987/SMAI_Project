<p>How can I avoid using all that casts in my code in order not to have my value boxed/unboxed by sonar ?</p>  <p>Here's my code :</p>  <pre><code>Double value = (Double) input.get(0);  int integer = new Double(value).intValue();  Double dec = Math.abs(value - (new Double(integer ).doubleValue())); </code></pre>  <p>I would like to avoid casting as much as I do, but I am not sure I can keep it boxed this way.</p>  <p>Any ideas ?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
