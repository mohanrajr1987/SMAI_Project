<p>I need some help, this is the code I'm referring to: </p>  <pre><code>int myId;  my Id = 20113275l int numLet;  numLet = 6; double doubleResult;  doubleResult = 10000 + (80 + ((myId - 123456) / ((numLet + 20)*(numLet + 20))      ));  System.out.println("Expression 5: " + doubleResult);  </code></pre>  <p>According to my calculator, the answer should be 39650.7, but when I run the program it's giving me 39650.0</p>  <p>Can anyone explain what's going on here? </p>
