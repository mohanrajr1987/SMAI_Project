<p>Edit:  This is not a duplicate. The question linked does not explain specifically where the 190734863 comes from. I understand the differences in precision. I want to know where the extra data is derived from and specifically the sequence of numbers I have quoted. I have made this clear in my question also from the start of the question.</p>  <p>I have created the following code to implicitly convert from a float to a double. </p>  <pre><code>// Implicitly converting a float to a double.               float floatingNumber = 1.23f;             double doubleNumber;              doubleNumber = floatingNumber; </code></pre>  <p>When I inspect the locals window during debug, I notice the following values. </p>  <pre><code>float = 1.23   // as expected double = 1.2300000190734863   // hmm.. </code></pre>  <p>My question is where do the 190734863 come from? in the double?</p>  <p>Thankyou!</p>
