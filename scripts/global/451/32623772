<p>both txtfield1 and txtMCLCCurrToEUR are doubles</p>  <p>(originally strings converted to double, both are the values of forex with 5 digits after decimal point)</p>  <pre><code>Dim f1 As Double txtField2.Text = (Double.TryParse(txtMCLCurrToEUR.Text, f1) / Double.TryParse(txtField1.Text, f1)).ToString("N5") </code></pre>  <p>irrespective of their values, I always end up with 1 in the txtField2.text</p>  <p>I seem to have overlooked something essential, but for the life of me -- I don't see what it could be...</p>  <p>any help would be much appreciated!</p>
