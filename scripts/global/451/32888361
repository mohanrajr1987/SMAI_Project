<p>I'm reading in a large data file into a <code>char[]</code> one line at a time. I need to sum several fields in the <code>char[]</code>.</p>  <p>Say I'm given an initialized: <code>char input[4270];</code> I want to find a number and here's what I know:</p>  <ul> <li>It starts at index <code>1234</code></li> <li>It will be no longer than 10 <code>char</code>s in length</li> <li>It will be of the format "567.89"</li> <li>If it is shorter than 10 <code>char</code>s the number will be left justified and space padded</li> </ul>  <p>After extracting the number at this index and another index I need to convert their sum back to a <code>char[]</code> so that I can write the output back to a file.</p>  <p>How do I accomplish this round trip?</p>
