<p>I have a class that does some length calculations based on a height on a ticket. It's been in place for years and working quite well... Until we got a unique ticket size. </p>  <p>They are entered by sales people in inches and are normally nice numbers like 3, 4 or 3.5 and store in a database - This one is however 3.66666 recurring (or 11/3) But it is being entered as 3.666 and causing the calculation to fail due to lost precision.</p>  <p>I have thought of a bit of a hack to restore precision for certain numbers, but thought maybe someone knows of a better way of getting a 3.666 or a 93.1333 back to it's number + two thirds status?</p>  <p>Thanks, Mick.</p>
