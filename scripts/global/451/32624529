<p>Hi guys my problem is this. I made a software in c# that is able to read and edit dxf files, I have to give this software to an american company but I have discovered the following problem: </p>  <p>Where I live we use the ',' to separate the integer part from the decimal part of the number (for example: 2,3658) but in the USA they use the '.' so they write 2.3658. When I try to read the string "2.3658" and convert it into a double with "Double.Parse("2.3658")" the double I get is 23658 like the method "Parse()" didn't recognised the decimal part. I have found the following solution:</p>  <pre><code> UpdatedCoorx = double.Parse(shiftedE[w + 1] ,NumberStyles.Number,CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture ("en-US")); </code></pre>  <p>Using CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture ("en-US") the c# can read the numbers correctly. My question is : is there a way that make c# automatically recognised the "Culture" of the pc where is installed so that it can read the number correctly???</p>
