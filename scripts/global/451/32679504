<p>i have a class with an construktor with two arguments of type double.</p>  <pre><code>public class NetcdfHandler {  double x; double y;  public NetcdfHandler (double x, double y){     x = this.x;     y = this.y; } } </code></pre>  <p>When i call this in the doGet Method of my Servlet, the given double values somehow are not "received" by the constructor. That means after creating an instance of NetcdfHandler, x and y both have the value 0.0 (but not "null") although "Lat" and "Lng" are set up correctly:</p>  <pre><code>public class Test extends HttpServlet {     private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;      double Lat;     double Lng;  public Test() {         super();     }  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse rsp) throws ServletException, IOException {         Lat = Double.parseDouble(req.getParameter("lat"));         Lng = Double.parseDouble(req.getParameter("lng"));          NetcdfHandler nc = new NetcdfHandler(Lat, Lng); } </code></pre>  <p>I guess it's quite a beginners mistake, but i couldn't figure out whats the problem here. Maybe someone can help?</p>
