<p>I have a number that is rounded to the nearest hundredth. I want to be able to check the value of the hundredths position. Is there an easy way to check a particular position in a Double in swift?</p>  <p>Example:  If value is 123.07, I want to be able to find the value of the number in the position of 7.</p>  <p>So in Pseudo something like: Double(123.07).hundredth == 7</p>  <p>Or would I have to do something like</p>  <pre><code>var value = 123.07 value *= 10 //value is now 1230.7 value % 1 </code></pre>  <p>trying to make sure I do things the RIGHT way instead of the only way i know how :)</p>
