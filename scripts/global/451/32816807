<p>Please excuse any amateur mistakes, I'm still quite new to this. For my class we need to convert a double input to a string to use in a different part of the project. The verification for the integers worked just fine and I attempted using some of the code from this previous question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17750872/validating-a-double-in-c">Validating a double in c++</a> though, much to my chagrin it did not work.</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>string input; bool valid; double num;  //Verification of valid inputs do {     valid = true;     cout &lt;&lt; "What is the " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; " rate of the population? (% per year): ";     getline(cin, input);     num = input.length();      if (num == 0)     {         cout &lt;&lt; "\nNo data was entered, please enter a number.\n";         valid = false;     }     else     {         for (double i = 0; i &lt; num; i++)         {             if (input.at(i) &lt; '0' || input.at(i) &gt; '9')             {                 cout &lt;&lt; "\nPlease enter a valid, positive number.\n";                 valid = false;                 break;             }         }     } } while (valid == false); return stod(input); </code></pre>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>Edit: I just found this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29169153/how-do-i-verify-a-string-is-valid-double-even-if-it-has-a-point-in-it">How do i verify a string is valid double (even if it has a point in it)?</a> and I can safely say I have no idea what is going on.</p>
