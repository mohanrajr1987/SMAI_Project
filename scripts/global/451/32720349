<p>This is part of the code. I keep trying to compile but it keeps giving me this error. Is it something wrong with the assignment statement?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ass1cpy.c: In function 'player_data':<br>   ass1cpy.c:26:46: warning: variable 'score' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]<br>     double average_goals,average_shots,effIndex,score[MAX];</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>int player_data(void){     char name[MAX];     int maxgames,playerId,games,minutes,goals,shots,assists,yellowCards,     redCards,checker = 0, i = 0;     double average_goals,average_shots,effIndex,score[MAX];     scanf("%d",&amp;maxgames);     while(scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d     %s",&amp;playerId,&amp;games,&amp;minutes,&amp;goals,&amp;shots,         &amp;assists,&amp;yellowCards,&amp;redCards,name) == 9){     average_goals = goal_average(goals,games);     average_shots = shots_average(shots,goals);     effIndex = effIndex_cal(goals,assists,redCards,yellowCards,games,maxgames);     if(checker == 0){         printf("Player %d scored %d goals in %d minutes from %d games\nGoals     per"             " game: %05.2f\nShots per goal: %05.2f\nEffindex:     %05.2f\n",playerId,             goals,minutes,games,average_goals,average_shots,effIndex);     }     checker = 1;     score[i] = effIndex     i++;         }         return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>How can I change this so that it can compile?</p>
