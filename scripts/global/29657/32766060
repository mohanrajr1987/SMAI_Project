<p>This is my first post on this website and my english is not very good but i will try my best at being understandable. I tried to find a suited answer but my lack of vocabulary must be limitated Google.</p>  <p>So, my issue is the following:</p>  <p>I'm trying to verticaly and horizontaly align some text in a container.</p>  <p>That i can do. </p>  <p>I managed to do that by using <code>display:table</code> and <code>display:table-cell</code> that i apply on the child.</p>  <p>See the first shape : <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/virgileg/0sd0r9nt/6/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/virgileg/0sd0r9nt/6/</a></p>  <p>But see, i want to center the text, but i also want my first line to be at the same level of aligment than the first.  In fact what i would love to do is kind of "merge" those to shape, the text-alignement of the second and the "content-alignement" of the first.</p>  <p>Voila. I hope that i made myself clear enough, don't hesitate to correct me if you're finding my writing to extreme for your eyes.</p>  <p>I thank you in advance.</p>  <p>Virgile G.</p>
