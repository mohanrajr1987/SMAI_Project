<p>I have a very strange problem with less. If I execute less as user in my ubuntu 14.04 linux box everything works fine. But if I execute less as root, it shows one page and exits (error code 1). I already checked my environment variables and tried to find a difference between user and root. But the only less-specific variables are </p>  <pre><code>LESSOPEN=| /usr/bin/lesspipe %s LESSCLOSE=/usr/bin/lesspipe %s %s </code></pre>  <p>Found nothing in .profile or .bashrc.</p>  <p>Because less is the pager (/etc/alternatives/pager is a link to /bin/less) for man, man doesn't work either:</p>  <pre><code>man: command exited with status 1: (cd /root/bla &amp;&amp; LESS=-ix8RmPm Manual page  ls(1) ?ltline %lt?L/%L.:byte %bB?s/%s..?e (END):?pB %pB\%.. (press h for help  or q to quit)$PM Manual page ls(1) ?ltline %lt?L/%L.:byte %bB?s/%s..?e  (END):?pB %pB\%.. (press h for help or q to quit)$ MAN_PN=ls(1) pager -s) </code></pre>  <p>After I executed the man-command, I find a file called "udo] password for user:" with content of the man-page:</p>  <pre><code>LS(1)                            User Commands                           LS(1)  N^HNA^HAM^HME^HE        ls - list directory contents  S^HSY^HYN^HNO^HOP^HPS^HSI^HIS^HS        l^Hls^Hs [_^HO_^HP_^HT_^HI_^HO_^HN]... [_^HF_^HI_^HL_^HE]... </code></pre>  <p>I reinstalled less and man with aptitude:</p>  <pre><code>aptitude reinstall less aptitude reinstall man-db manpages </code></pre>  <p>But no changes.</p>  <p>Is it possible to log the errors of less? I found no "verbose" or "debug" option.</p>  <p>Maybe, someone has an idea...</p>
