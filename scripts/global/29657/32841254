<p>I have noticed that sometimes IIS 8.5 does not return static files (*.less and *.js) if they are included into html page. Browser sends request do download them and continue spinning forever. That is illustrated on following image: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AWx7N.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AWx7N.jpg" alt="captured requests by fiddler "></a> After receiving page (request #4) browser tries to download styles for that page and sends request for it (#5) which hangs forever. </p>  <p>Interesting thing, if I replay the same request using Fiddler (#2) - I will get the response (304 or 200) with no delay. Also, I can restart this particular app (not whole IIS) using IIS Manager and response will be send to hanged request (#5). Also disabling header "Keep-Alive" will prevent such hanging, but this can reduce performance. The hanging is not persistent but happens very often.</p>  <p>Question is what can cause such hanging? If you have any thoughts please share them and I will check.</p>
