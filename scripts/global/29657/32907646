<p>In my meteor app I have some functions that handle colors in the client side and I'd like to use less instead of my own code inside a helper function but I can't find the way to do it. It is already working in the server to compile <code>.less</code> files into <code>.css</code>.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this using the less meteor package, without copying a <code>less.min.js</code> file to a client folder?</p>
