<p>I'm start using LESS in a project today and found a problem, lets describe this - </p>  <p>I always use predefined CSS Reset and as well as WordPress Core CSS along with my upcoming CSS in any project that I work on. The problem was not happened before I use LESS. </p>  <p>When I write new LESS code and complied it through SimpLESS application or any other compiler, I just got my existing CSS (Reset, WP Core) code removed from my stylesheet (.css) and update the stylesheet with new CSS complied code.</p>  <p>It's really annoying for me as I'm using LESS for the first time.</p>  <p>So, how to I keep my exiting CSS and the Complied CSS both at once?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance! :)</p>
