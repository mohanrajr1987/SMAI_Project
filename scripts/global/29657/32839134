<p>I'm trying to set up <code>lessc</code> (from node) in order to use <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-plugin-less/metrics" rel="nofollow">this eclipse plugin</a>.</p>  <p>Since I'm behind a company proxy and/or firewall (don't know the exact setup), I was unable to directly install less by <code>npm install -g less</code>, so I manually downloaded the latest release from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/less" rel="nofollow">here</a>, extracted the zip and did <code>npm install -g &lt;extracted-folder&gt;</code>, which seemed to work.</p>  <p>However, when navigating to a directory with a .less file and execute <code>lessc myfile.less</code>, the command silently finishes and no output file is generated. I've tried manually specifying the output file and setting the <code>--verbose</code> flag, but still no output on the command line nor any file.</p>  <p>What is going on here, and how should I continue debugging the issue?</p>  <p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>  <p>In case anyone is facing the same problem, here's what I'm currently using as alternative: <a href="http://koala-app.com/" rel="nofollow">Koala</a> is a self-contained application to compile LESS (among other things) and is capable doing so immediately after a change, so I keep it running in the background and edit my less file in Eclipse, which gets automatically re-compiled on each save operation.</p>
