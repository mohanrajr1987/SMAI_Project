<p>How can I create a cross in CSS?  I just need a cross that will be 1 pixel width and 20 pixels in height. I have tried the code from this question "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17359787/create-a-cross-shape-in-css">Create a cross shape in CSS</a>". But it gets all crazy on me and turns to be only 1 line.  </p>
