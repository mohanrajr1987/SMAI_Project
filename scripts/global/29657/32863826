<p>I want to load two different files from two different location depends upon domain name.</p>  <p>I have used angular conditional <strong>ng-href</strong> directive to include files but it failed to generate CSS and if I include same file with static path it compiles properly and get applied on HTML page.</p>  <p>Ex. For development environment I want to serve local LESS file from templates directory and for published template I want to serve custom created LESS file from different location. </p>  <p><strong>[Dev] LESS file path</strong> </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost/projectName/templates/001/css/001.less </code></pre>  <p><strong>[Production] relative LESS file path</strong></p>  <pre><code>css/001.less </code></pre>  <p>How to achieve conditional LESS file loading using javascript?</p>
