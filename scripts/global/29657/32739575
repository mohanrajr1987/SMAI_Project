<p>I have a loop in Less which contains <code>opacity</code>. I would like the <code>opacity</code> to change based on the loop number variable but I keep getting an error "unrecognised input".</p>  <p>Something like this...</p>  <pre><code>div {     .circles(5);      .circles(@n, @i: 1) when (@i =&lt; @n) {         &amp;:nth-of-type(@{i}) {             opacity: 0.@{i};         }         .circles(@n, (@i + 1));     } } </code></pre>  <p>I've tried this too...</p>  <pre><code>opacity: 0.@i; </code></pre>  <p>and I've tried adding quotes in various places.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
