<p>So I'm taking over design of a website that a developer (who I can't contact) left. He used Node.js and LESS.</p>  <p>I'm somewhat familiar with Node (how it works but I'm not a developer) and I usually use Sass. Anyways, none of my CSS changes show, which makes me think that it's not compiling right.</p>  <p>I honestly need a 101 answer. I don't even know where my changes should be added and how to compile. I added a screenshot of the structure of the CSS above.</p>  <p>Here is what the structure looks like: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GUNeL.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/GUNeL.png</a></p>  <p>Can anyone help me?</p>  <p>Thanks so much!</p>
