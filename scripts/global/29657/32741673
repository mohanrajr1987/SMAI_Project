<p>I have an H1 inside an article element.</p>  <p>My h1 is styled something like this:</p>  <pre><code>h1 {     &amp;:extend(.display1);      border-bottom:solid 0.1rem @divider;     color:@primaryText;     margin-bottom:2.4rem;     padding-bottom:0.7rem; } </code></pre>  <p>However, I only want to apply this styling when the H1 isn't inside an article. I thought it would be a simple addition to the CSS like this:</p>  <pre><code>*:not(article) h1 { } </code></pre>  <p>However, this doesn't seem to work for me and I've been left scratching my head. Is it possible? Have I got the syntax right? Is there something else lurking in the CSS?</p>  <p>Any help appreciated.</p>
