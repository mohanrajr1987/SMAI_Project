<p>When I'm developing in PHP, I usually have a separate window running which has the Nginx error log running in it. I run <code>less /var/log/nginx/error.log</code> and then press Shift+F to get it to run in what I'm calling "streaming mode". </p>  <p>I want to set up an alias that does this automatically, but I've searched around and combed through the man page and I can't seem to find a way to get LESS to just launch in this mode. Using <code>watch</code> and <code>tail</code> isn't appropriate as I'm using the i3wm and watch doesn't scale as well.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
