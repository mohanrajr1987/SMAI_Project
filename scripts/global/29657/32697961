<p>The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap 3 responsive grid</a> is mobile first. That is to say that the media queries are defined using <code>min-width</code> rather than <code>max-width</code>, and if the media queries are not interpreted by the browser then the grid renders as a single 'tube of content'.</p>  <p>I have a client that wants their front-end to be based on Bootstrap 3, with the grid layout displayed in IE 8 even without JavaScript, ruling out <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond" rel="nofollow">Respond.js</a> for polyfilling the media query support in IE 8. They also want the site to behave responsively in mobile browsers, ruling out the completely <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#disable-responsive" rel="nofollow">non-responsive</a> approach.</p>  <p>So the question is how can the Bootstrap 3 grid LESS CSS be modified so that it's behaviour is non-mobile (large screen) first?</p>  <p>I've searched for a solution, but I haven't been able to find any. I've started work on porting the grid behaviour to non-mobile (large screen) first myself but quickly ran into complexity. This feels like it should be a solved problem.</p>  <p>I've created a Codepen with with the Bootstrap v3.3.5 grid extracted as a <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwOraX?editors=110" rel="nofollow">reduced test case</a>. (The only code I've added that's not come directly from Bootstrap v3.3.5 is the <code>.show-grid</code> class from the docs to help visualise the layout).</p>
