<p>I'm working with a sophisticated LESS-based template in a CMS that we must use for (good) commercial reasons.  I want to be able to give a different ruleset based on the URL referenced in href (which I can use to distinguish between my site's document store and other locations) WITHOUT having to class the tags - because non-technical editors aren't reliable class-setters.</p>  <p>LESS, of which I have only beginner's knowledge, seems not to be able to do this: is this right?  If it is, is there another way?</p>
