<p>I've been struggling with this problem for several months trying to solve it but with no success.</p>  <p>I am not able to connect any Android device to the PC (Mass storage or ADB) beside Samsung phones without hacking or using different drivers (only manually installed).</p>  <p>I have this problem with Sony, Nexus, HTC and more China Android phones.</p>  <p>I tried to use the default USB driver(ADB interface), delivered with the phone, but windows cannot install it since it doesn't see that driver compatible with my device. I hacked the driver by inserting the hardware IDs in the driver's .inf file. This way every phone is being installed but this way some phones work, others don't (ADB). For the mass storage mode, I somehow managed to install every phone as Portable Devices / MTP Device and this way works, I can browse through the folders, without having access to ADB.</p>  <p>This problem is not reproducible on another PC; when the phone is connected for the first time, it appears as a mass storage device in My computer, without any effort. If I give the default driver, the phone is ready to be exploited via ADB also. </p>  <p>It's very frustrating to install / uninstall drivers depending on your need dozens of times per day, without knowing for sure if it'll work.</p>  <p>Please, if you know any tips how can I solve this, I'll be very grateful. Thanks a lot!</p>
