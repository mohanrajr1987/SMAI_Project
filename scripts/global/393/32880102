<p>I want to boot kali linux from usb Drive. So I downloaded Kali linux ISO 32bit , and by using dd command (superuser)</p>  <h1>dd if=kali-linux.iso of=/dev/disk2</h1>  <p>and dd finished , and I rebooted Macbook, and pressed option key, and selected EFI boot, but Kali linux did't boot, and alternatively Mac OS booted.</p>  <p>After that , I installed rEFIt, and executed /efi/refit/enable.sh , enable-always.sh, but, rEFIt did't boot, the same screen as before showed up.</p>  <p>After that, I installed unebootin, and again I burned ISO to USB , and rebooted, and selected EFI boot, but Kali linux didn't boot.</p>  <p>I have no idea what's wrong, I think ISO File is correct probably.</p>  <p>Please tell me some idea, please help me. </p>
