<p>I'm having an issue playing something with USB communication. I'm  using <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/HidLibrary/" rel="nofollow">HidLibrary</a> library, which works beautifully. The only thing that doesn't work is timeout (I already looked on web for a solution but this is a library bug). So, when I send a message and no response comes to PC, my loop runs forever. I am just waiting for bool is message is readed with success or not. If a message does not come, what then? How I can solve that? With multithreading (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.waithandle(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">WaitHandle class</a>) or are there any alternatives? </p>
