<p>I have an Android app that works with a USB device and the app is setup as USB host.  Along with this app, I have 2 other apps that is supposed to start when the device boots up - Palapa Web Server and ADB Wireless.  </p>  <p>When I power up the device, the OS asks whether or not to use my app to connect to the USB device, and if I click Ok, it makes the connection and the app works with the USB device.  But for some reason, enabling the app to work with the USB device in this way is causing Palapa Web Server and ADB Wireless to not be able to properly acquire the WIFI connection that they need. </p>  <p>What might be causing this and how can it be resolved?</p>  <p>Some things that I noticed:</p>  <ol> <li>I made it so that when my app runs, it also runs ADB Wireless using the following: <code>getActivity().getPackageManager().getLaunchIntentForPackage("siir.es.adbWireless");</code>, which brings ADB Wireless to the front, but the app show no WIFI connection, and cannot work properly because of the lack of connection</li> <li>When the same is done for Palapa Web Server, I was able to manually start the server, even though it is supposed to start on boot up of the device</li> <li>The Android device is on the WIFI network, as indicated by looking through my router's CP</li> <li>When the choice of whether or not to allow app to be used to run the USB device, if I pick cancel, then my app still loads, but both ADB Wireless and Palapa Web Server runs properly.  </li> </ol>  <p>Any pointer to help debug this would be greatly appreciated!</p>
