<p>I am working on a program that is supposed to run every time a USB keyboard is inserted in a computer. I am capturing the event with <code>udev</code> but I need a way to exclusively capture keyboard events (keypresses) and not propagate them any further until my program is complete.</p>  <p>This is supposed to be a Linux only program. Currently I am using <code>C and C++</code> but I could use any technlogy to achieve this.</p>  <p>Any ideas how it could be done?</p>
