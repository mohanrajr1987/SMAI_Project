<p>so for a school project I need an OSX application which can transfer files from my mac to an android device. My problem is that I have no experience with communicating with usb devices, nor did I find a helpful tutorial/guide. The only documentation I found was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/USBBook/USBIntro/USBIntro.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which was only confusing to me. So if anyone has a step-by-step tutorial or any tip on how to do that, I would be very thankful.</p>
