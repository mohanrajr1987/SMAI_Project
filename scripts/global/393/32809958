<p>I need to find out a way to develop an app that creates two virtual devices on the USB port but still in USB slave mode. Here is what I need to do:</p>  <ul> <li>Install my app on android.</li> <li>Connect my android via usb cable to a Windows CE host. </li> </ul>  <p>Windows CE will detect two devices: </p>  <ol> <li>USB MASS STORAGE (android app will map this to a fs image file or a folder - can be readonly)</li> <li>Standard serial port (android app will read and write to this port to communicate to a specific app on WinCE).</li> </ol>  <p>Is there any APIs that helps me to do this? I can only find docs about USB HOST mode and that's not what I'm looking for.</p>
