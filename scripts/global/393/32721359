<p>There is a custom USB device I need to communicate with. There is no particular driver for it. The device doesn't show as <code>/dev/tty*</code>.</p>  <p>I <a href="http://www.signal11.us/oss/udev/" rel="nofollow">found out</a> how I can use <code>libudev</code> to enumerate the USB devices and let's say I manage to get the corresponding <code>struct udev_device</code>.</p>  <p>What I can't figure out is how I can <code>open(2)</code> the device so I can <code>write(2)</code> to and <code>read(2)</code> from it.</p>  <p>Is it possible to communicate with a generic USB device, setting baudrate and just read/write? If so, what "file" should I open after I find the device with <code>libudev</code>? If not, is writing a kernel-level driver necessary?</p>
