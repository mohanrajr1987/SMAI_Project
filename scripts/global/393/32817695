<p>I have a USB bluetooth dongle and its driver for win 7. I need to create a windows desktop application to access data <strong>on the USB bus</strong>. I have installed Visual studio 2013 and WDK in my WIN 7 PC, but all the documentation in msdn talks about writing driver for usb, rather than a way for just accessing the data.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea on how to access USB bus data after driver is installed? Preferably using Visual studio?</p>
