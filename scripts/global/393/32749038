<p>Please advice me, is there any built in function to check HID Keyboard Device when USB is hooked up to the system? It's mean my app can detect HID Keyboard Device if user plug in to pc/laptop port.  And after detect new HID Keyboard Device, what is the best way to get USB HID Keyboard Device "Parent ID" and "Device Instance Path".</p>  <p>Many sites and users publish with C languange but i really dont understand with C Family languages. Please anyone can help to advice for VB.Net language?</p>
