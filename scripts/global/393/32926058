<p>I'm using win7-64bit</p>  <p>I am in the process of developing a user interface for a USB CDC device (used as a flash programmer) I am adding in exception handlers and constantly testing, but whenever something does go wrong and the program crashes, the USB device disappears from device manager and will not reconnect. I uninstall and reinstall the driver (which I have made automatic in the c# GUI) but this doesn't fix it either. Nor does resetting the computer, changing USB ports, etc.. The only way I know to fix it is to delete the registry entries for the specific PID / VID stuff and then unplug the USB and plug it back in. Windows the reinstalls it (because it still has the inf file) and it works perfectly. This shouldn't be an issue in the release version, but for testing it has been a real problem constantly going through that process. </p>  <p>My question is why is this happening? </p>
