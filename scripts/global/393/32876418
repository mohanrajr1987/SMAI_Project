<p>Acer does not support Acer Iconia A500 drivers for new windows. This is great problem for Eclipse and Android Studio developers as me, because device is not visible for developing. I was looking for an hours for sollution. But found it ! Hope this helps for other developers with Iconia tablet.</p>
