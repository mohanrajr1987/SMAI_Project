<p>I had to make a USB drive for a software installation, and to make it look more appropriate and nicely setup I've made it able to autorun, but I've tried its code string every way I can and it's not working.  It does show the icon of the file, but is not doing any autorun.  I'm using xp vm (tried on all sp1,2 &amp; 3). The file is an .exe file.</p>  <p>I've done it like this:</p>  <pre><code>[autorun]  open=file.exe  icon=file.exe,0 </code></pre>  <p>I saved the file with autorun.inf in the flash drive and file.exe was the file name. The autorun is enabled, I've checked it in the regedit - it is set as 91 hexadecimal.</p>  <p>I also tried other ways like shellexecute and useautorun, but nothing is working. Is there any solution?</p>
