<p>I want to route audio from an Android app I am developing to a PC via a standard USB cable. I have found some sources discussing native USB Audio support in Android Lollipop, but am unable to find any documentation or example code online.</p>  <p>Is this possible? Preferably, Windows should recognize the device as a standard microphone without the need for any extra drivers or software.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
