<p>I installed Linux Mint on a pen drive, but it doesn't boot. Pen drive is parted in MBR. I created a partition EXT4 (20GB) and specified "/" as mount point during installation. After installation, I reboot my PC, but in my BIOS (UEFI) pen drive doesn't appear. </p>  <p>I also tried to create EFI partition, during installation, but it remains empty. Setup doesn't put any file in EFI partition.</p>  <p>How can I install correctly?</p>
