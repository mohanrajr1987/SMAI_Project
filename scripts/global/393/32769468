<p>I'm trying to gain access to the GoPro Hero 4 Black using the USB cable connects directly to my PC using .Net/C# application code.</p>  <p>When I use the folderBrowserDialog I am unable to select "ok" from the dialog box when I find the camera in the browser.  It takes me into the camera directories, it just won't allow me to hit the "ok" button - it's grayed out.</p>  <p>Then when I try to select multiple files using the openFileDialog it will only 1 file at a time, and it returns a weird directory path back (like this: C:\Users\joeSmith\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\IE\44EARR1Z\GOPR9354[1].JPG)</p>  <p>All I am attempting to do is identify a GoPro 4 Hero.  So I want to be able to poll for a device, determine that it is a GoPro, and further detect the serial number of the device that I polled to see if it matches an expected (or already stored) serial number. </p>  <p>Once I identify the GoPro, I want to get the images and copy them (via USB connection) into a specific folder of my choosing.  I have searched far and wide and I'm stuck...</p>  <p>Any ideas (keep in mind I'm not a C# guru) - and I do not wish to use the wireless access at this time.  So I need to do it the manual way.</p>
