<p>I am currently using usb4java library to have attach/detach events when plugging or unplugging HID devices.</p>  <p>My problem is that it uses LibUSB to connect and LibUSB is not compatible with HID Devices, you need to install a special driver, I get the serial number perfectly but I can't dialog with the HID devices anymore ...</p>  <p>Is there an alternative to get the serial number of HID Devices on the attach/detach events in Java  ? </p>
