<p>I'm trying to write a script that make a list of connected USBs list like this:</p>  <ul> <li>MyFlash - ADATA</li> <li>BootUSB - ADATA</li> <li>MyBackup - SAN DISK</li> </ul>  <p>But I don't know how to identify the connected USB device is a storage one, and the volume name of it.</p>  <p>C/C++, Python, or Node.js help are welcome, and only under Linux OS.</p>  <p>I'm looking to mount and remount using code, but I think It will be easy to use Linux commands for this.</p>
