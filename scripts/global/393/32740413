<p>I have enabled usbmon in the linux kernel for Android on a device that has USB host already (Rooted Nexus 7, 2012, WiFi, Android version 5.0.2). After booting from the new kernel, tcpdump -D shows:</p>  <pre><code>1.any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces) [Up, Running] 2.lo [Up, Running, Loopback] 3.p2p0 [Up] 4.wlan0 [Up]  5.nflog (Linux netfilter log (NFLOG) interface) 6.nfqueue (Linux netfilter queue (NFQUEUE) interface) 7.usbmon1 (USB bus number 1) </code></pre>  <p>but running tcpdump -i usbmon1  results in</p>  <pre><code>tcpdump: Can't open USB bus file /sys/kernel/debug/usbmon/1t: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>and in fact there is no usbmon folder in that location. Did I miss something?</p>
