<p>I am trying to programmatically access internal device counters of a document scanning device that is connected via USB to my computer. I am NOT interested in the data that a scanner normally outputs (content of scanned pages, etc)! Instead, I would like to know how many pages were scanned so far. Does anyone have a clue on how to access such data? SNMP is usually the way to go for such device counters, but not with USB devices (at least I am not aware of how to do it).</p>  <p>OS is Windows 7, programming language is C#, and the scanning device is a Canon DR-M160 (hopefully this shouldn't matter, as I try to create a vendor-independend solution).</p>
