<p>I', trying to access a USB data from a bluetooth device by using Visual studio 2013 and WDK. I created a WIN USB application in Visual studio and changed the DEVICE class GUID to Bluetooth GUID {e0cbf06c-cd8b-4647-bb8a-263b43f0f974} in inf and device.h files. Now I need to access the USB control, interrupt and data pipes, but when I call SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces  I always get ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS.</p>  <p>Does anyone know why?</p>
