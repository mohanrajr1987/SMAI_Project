<p>I am trying to use Python 2.7 with PyUSB to talk to a National Instruments DAQ board. I am using a MacBook Pro and running Yosemite 10.10.4. I have been able to install Python and the PyUSB package without any obvious problems, but when I try to use PyUSB, it cannot find a backend library:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import usb.core &gt;&gt;&gt; usb.core.find()  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;pyshell#83&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;     usb.core.find()   File        "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/usb/core.py", line 1199, in find     raise ValueError('No backend available') ValueError: No backend available </code></pre>  <p>I have attempted to install <code>libusb-1.0</code> multiple different ways but Python cannot seem to find any module named <code>libusb</code>. I tried:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Downloading the tarball from SourceForge</p></li> <li><p>Installing brew and using "brew install libusb-compat" and "brew link libusb-compat"</p></li> <li><p>using sys.path.append("/usr/local/lib") to help Python find <code>libusb</code></p></li> </ol>  <p>and this is where I get desperate:</p>  <ol start="4"> <li><p>Using pip to "pip install libusb" (does pip even work with libraries?)</p></li> <li><p>Copying the contents of /usr/local/lib where the <code>libusb-1.0.dylib</code> and other <code>libusb</code> files are located to various locations where I thought Python might be looking for it.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Nevertheless, when I call <code>help("Modules")</code> in either IDLE or iPython, nothing resembling <code>libusb</code> shows up and calls to usb.core.find() continue to complain about a missing Backend.</p>  <p>How does one get Python to find <code>libusb</code>? Is the fact that it doesn't show up in <code>help("Modules")</code> even related to usb.core.find() complaining about a lack of a Backend?</p>  <p>I've dropped a good day on this so far and read a good 20 Q&amp;As with no avail. Any advice would be quite welcome at this point. Also, this is my first ever question for stackoverflow, so please ask me to clarify if I've omitted critically enabling information or structured my question poorly. Thanks.</p>
