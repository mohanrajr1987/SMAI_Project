<p>I'd like to use php to crawl/scrape google and social media sites so I can create an embedded registration form on my website. For example, when the person types their name in I'd like various photos to pop up and allow the user to select an image of themselves and have the rest of the information on my form be automatically pulled from the various social media websites. Does anyone know of any tutorials I can follow? Thank you!</p>
