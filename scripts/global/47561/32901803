<p>Scrapy is quite an interesting framework. A couple of questions I now have:</p>  <p>1) In an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32818729/scrapy-how-to-extract-all-blog-posts-from-a-category">earlier question</a>, I figured out how to extract all blog posts using scrapy but there is a glitch in the solution. You see, a blog post typically has a url "continue reading" which when clicked shows you the complete post. So how do I extract the complete post?..This is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32818729/scrapy-how-to-extract-all-blog-posts-from-a-category">my code</a> </p>  <p>2) How can I code the spider to check for a new blog post using scrapy?</p>  <p>3) How do i clean the extracted data? One approach I thought was to import regular expression library in the spider class of scrapy. But when I try the crawling I get an import error that regex module not found? So does that mean I cannot do the data cleaning in the spider? Do i have a to write a separate class for it? </p>  <p>Any suggestions?  </p>
