<p>I have a scraper to pull search results from a number of travel websites. Now that I have the search results nicely displayed with "Book Now" buttons, I want those "Book Now" buttons to redirect to the specific search result so the user can book that specific travel search result. These search results are dynamic so the redirect may change.</p>  <p>What's the easiest way to accomplish this? I'm building this search engine in Python/Django and have Django CMS. </p>
