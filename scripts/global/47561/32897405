<p>What do I need to do to prevent the error: <code>AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split lines'</code> from occurring here?  How to I convert the list that I have into a form that can have <code>splitlines</code> attributed to?</p>  <pre><code>import requests import re from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import csv  #Read csv with open ("gyms4.csv") as file:     reader = csv.reader(file)     csvfilelist = [row[0] for row in reader]  print csvfilelist  #Get data from each url def get_page_data():     for page_data in csvfilelist.splitlines():         r = requests.get(page_data.strip())         soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser')         yield soup </code></pre>
