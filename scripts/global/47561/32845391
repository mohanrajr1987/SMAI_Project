<p>I was trying to get the postcodes for DFS, for that i tried getting the href for each shop and then click on it, the next page has shop location from which i can get the postal code, but i am able to get things working, Where am i going wrong? I tried getting upper level attribute first <code>td.searchResults</code> and then for each of them i am trying to click on <code>href with title DFS</code> and after clicking getting the postalCode. Eventually iterate for all three pages.  If there is a better way to do it let me know. </p>  <pre><code> driver = webdriver.Firefox()     driver.get('http://www.localstore.co.uk/stores/75061/dfs/')     html = driver.page_source     soup = BeautifulSoup(html)     listings = soup.select('td.searchResults')     for l in listings:          while True:                     driver.find_element_by_css_selector("a[title*='DFS']").click()               shops= {}               #info = soup.find('span', itemprop='postalCode').contents               html = driver.page_source               soup = BeautifulSoup(html)               info = soup.find(itemprop="postalCode").get_text()               shops.append(info) </code></pre>  <p>Update:</p>  <pre><code>driver = webdriver.Firefox() driver.get('http://www.localstore.co.uk/stores/75061/dfs/') html = driver.page_source soup = BeautifulSoup(html) listings = soup.select('td.searchResults')  for l in listings:     driver.find_element_by_css_selector("a[title*='DFS']").click()     shops = []     html = driver.page_source     soup = BeautifulSoup(html)     info = soup.find_all('span', attrs={"itemprop": "postalCode"})     for m in info:         if m:            m_text = m.get_text()            shops.append(m_text)     print (shops) </code></pre>
