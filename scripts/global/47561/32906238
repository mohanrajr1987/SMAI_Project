<p>I'm trying to get the text (contents without the tags) of all p elements in a given div:</p>  <pre><code>import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  def getArticle(url):     url = 'http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34421804'     result = requests.get(url)     c = result.content     soup = BeautifulSoup(c)      article = []     article = soup.find("div", {"class":"story-body__inner"}).findAll('p')     for element in article:         article = ''.join(element.findAll(text = True))     return article </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that this returns only the contents of the last paragraph. But the code works perfectly if I just use print:</p>  <pre><code>    for element in article:         print ''.join(element.findAll(text = True))     return </code></pre>  <p>I want to call this function elsewhere, so I need it to return the text, not just print it. I have searched stackoverflow and googled a lot, but didn't find the answer and I don't understand what might be the problem. I use Python 2.7.9 and bs4. Thanks in advance!</p>
