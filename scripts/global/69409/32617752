<p>We have this requirement where the user wants to see data from a MSSQLServer database right on the desktop when the user logs in.</p>  <p>Very similar of what BGInfo can do for you but instead of system properties data to have some metrics from your operational database.</p>  <ol> <li>Would JavaFX work for this requirement? </li> <li>Could it be on the background image?  or would it be accessible only via a double click?</li> <li>Can anybody share a very minimalistic example?</li> <li>Any other options I should consider?</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks, -Viriato.</p>
