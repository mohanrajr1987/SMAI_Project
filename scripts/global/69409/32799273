<p>I've some images into the project folder. Each image has a name. For example: a, aa, aba etc. I want to show the related image into ScrollPane when it matches an image name typed into the TextField.</p>  <p>I did similar one by using the following codes:</p>  <pre><code>URL url = getClass().getResource("/imran/dict/meaning/"+txt.getText()); Image image = new Image(url.toExternalForm()); showinScroll.setContent(new ImageView(image)); </code></pre>  <p>But this is not what I wanted. It works when I type some text and press enter. But I want to show the related image into ScrollPane when it matches an image name while typing into the TextField. No need to press enter after typing the full text.</p>  <p>I succeeded to do the same thing for ImageView using binding. Here is the following code:</p>  <pre><code>@Override public void initialize(URL location, ResourceBundle resources)  {     showinScroll.imageProperty().bind(Bindings.createObjectBinding(() -&gt;      {         URL url = getClass().getResource("/imran/dict/meaning/"+grabTxt.getText());         Image image = new Image(url.toExternalForm());                   return image;                },grabTxt.textProperty())); } </code></pre>  <p>I want to do the same thing for ScrollPane not for ImageView. How to do it?</p>
