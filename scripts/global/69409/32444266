<p>I'm using JavaFX MediaPlayer to reproduce a streaming song. I have a time remaining of the song that is constantly updated and occasionally there will be 3:00+ minutes left of the song and the MediaPlayer skips to the end and then plays the next one.</p>  <p>Is there some sort of EOF that code that it's reading that causes this? If I change to a 3rd party audioplayer, I have no issues.</p>
