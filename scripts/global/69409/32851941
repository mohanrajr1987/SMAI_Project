<p>I am using JavaFX and I have a StackPane within a BorderPane within a TitledPane. Like so:</p>  <p>TitledPane->AnchorPane->BorderPane->StackPane</p>  <p>The StackPane is placed in the center region of the BorderPane. My problem is that when I run the app, the BorderPane is not filling the AnchorPane that is associated with the TitledPane. I have tried the AnchorPane.setBottom(), setTop(), setLeft(), and setRight() properties, setting them to 0.0 and it doesn't work. Thanks.</p>
