<p>I'm working in javaFx2 and Scene Builder, I assign an icon to the button in the "Initialize" method, that works perfect, but the graphic doesnÂ´t have a gap between the text and the icon and I want it a little more separated. I putted various values in the "Graphic text gap" property in scene builder and nothing has changed. For otherside, I tried stablishing this value with "setGraphicTextGap()" method with the same result.</p>  <p>This is a capture of what I get in the application: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sldeI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sldeI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>and this is my FXML file of the root scene, where the toolBar is contained <a href="http://pastebin.com/J7L7h5xC" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/J7L7h5xC</a></p>
