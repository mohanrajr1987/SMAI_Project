<p>I'm working on a custom graph modeling component. I've extended <code>Region</code> class and am positioning child nodes using some custom rules.</p>  <p>The problem is that <code>Region</code>'s layout bounds start from (0, 0) and I'd like to change that so that I can add nodes at negative coordinates. I have trouble finding any documentation on how JavaFX's <code>Node</code> calculates its own bounds.</p>  <p>So how does one overwrite layout bounds of <code>Region</code>?</p>
