<p>i am using JavaFX (using scene builder) and i am trying to build a progressBar with a progressIndicator that will show a background file upload status.</p>  <p>Here is my javafx controller (some initialization):</p>  <pre><code>@FXML private Pane uploadsStatuses; @FXML private ProgressBar uploadBar; @FXML private ProgressIndicator uploadProgressIndicator; ... @Override @FXML public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {     ...     assert uploadsStatuses != null : "fx:id=\"uploadsStatuses\" was not injected: check your FXML file 'FXMLDocument.fxml'.";     assert uploadBar != null : "fx:id=\"uploadBar\" was not injected: check your FXML file 'FXMLDocument.fxml'.";     assert uploadProgressIndicator != null : "fx:id=\"uploadProgressIndicator\" was not injected: check your FXML file 'FXMLDocument.fxml'.";     ... </code></pre>  <p>For uploading the file i am using FTP4J library and i have already implemented a way to calculate file upload percentage:</p>  <pre><code>public class Ftp4jListener implements FTPDataTransferListener {     private int transfBytes=0;     private int totalBytes=0;     private long fileSize = -1;     private String fileName;     ...     @Override     public void transferred(int length)     {         transfBytes+=length;         float percent = (float) transfBytes / this.fileSize;         float fPercent = percent*100;         log.info("File: " + this.fileName + " | Bytes transfered "+ transfBytes + " Percentage: " + fPercent + "%");     } </code></pre>  <p>The question is how could i bound FTP4J listener with my progressBar &amp; progressIndicator?</p>
