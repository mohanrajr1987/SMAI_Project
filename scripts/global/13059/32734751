<p>my problem is: I have some tabs with a dropdown menu,each tab has an iframe: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AZr2t.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AZr2t.png" alt="MY TABS"></a></p>  <p>When the user clicks the dropdown menu I need to run some js on iframe content,then I thought that the correct thing to do is this js in my html page:</p>  <pre><code>    var scriptTag = "&lt;script&gt;alert("blabla");&lt;"; // saving script to run     scriptTag += "/script&gt;"; //add this for fixing the script tag problem     $("#myframeid").contents().find("head").append(scriptTag); //appending the script on the head of iframe </code></pre>  <p>But when I run it, the console reports like: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property   from 'HTMLIFrameElement': Blocked a frame with origin   "<a href="http://localhost:8080" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a>" from accessing a frame with origin   "<a href="http://www.otherdomainsite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.otherdomainsite.com</a>". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Obviously if it is on a different domain it does not run,so what I have to do now? Am I doing something wrong? </p>  <p>I heard about postMessage ecc.. methods but I never used them.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
