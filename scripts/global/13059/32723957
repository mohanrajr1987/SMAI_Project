<p>I would like to implement a page which can display (embedded) an other page from a completely different domain, which is not under my control. (say www.google.com).  The end user fill a url input field in the parent page then the parent page shows the embedded content.</p>  <p>This could be easy so far however, the parent page must have the ability to read and manipulate the embedded page's document. Nothing fancy just highlighting elements. I know this arises serious security concerns.  Some of the read data from the child page must be sent to my server (same domain as the parent page)</p>  <p>(Please note despite of the topic, this application would be completely legal commercial service, nothing to do with any gray or black trick or practice)</p>  <ul> <li>Is it possible at all?</li> <li>Is it help if the end user installs an extension from me (written for some helper functionality to accomplish the task), and trusts me as the publisher?</li> <li>If none of the above helps, is there any way to accomplish the specified task than this iframe idea?</li> </ul>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>(The app should be implemented for Chrome, FF and IE, I've just could not add more tags than 5..)</p>
