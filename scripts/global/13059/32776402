<p>So I have a number of client websites, running a service catalogue for net services, the visitor visits these and order them, now we want to enable direct activation of these services, so we need to identify the visitor in my clients own network.</p>  <p>So I'm using an IFRAME to load a resource from a server inside the network, that can identify the customer, and then redirects back to my script with an identification string.</p>  <p>Now, iframe isn't ideal for cross domain stuff, so what options do I have? I need the users browser to make a HTTP request to another server</p>
