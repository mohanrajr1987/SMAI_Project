<p>I've read repeatedly that domain x.com cannot read cookies that reside within notx.com, but if I log into Facebook.com and then in another tab log into domain x.com, which uses some Facebook widget, the Facebook widget installed on x.com knows I've logged into Facebook and does not require re-authentication to use it. How does the widget on x.com read a cookie cross-domain under Facebook.com? </p>  <p>Update With Solution:</p>  <p>How to read a cookie cross-domain was answered a year ago by @Ludovic here, which I summarize below, and my implementation of it works across all major browsers:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3342140/cross-domain-cookies/25861695#comment53461346_25861695">Cross-Domain Cookies</a></p>  <p>The following client-server configurations are required to share cross-domain client browser stored cookie data (as opposed to ephemeral client or server sessions):</p>  <p>Server: permissive Access-Control-Allow-*: declarations and HttpOnly set false</p>  <p>Client: AJAX requests must include declarations for both cross-domain and credentials</p>
