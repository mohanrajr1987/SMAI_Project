<p>I'm making a connection to a socket server :</p>  <pre><code>  var sock = new SockJS('http://hostname:9090/ws'); </code></pre>  <p>And the server is a remote machine. The connection doesn't happen and it throws this error.</p>  <p>As I understand I would need to set a cross origin header while creating the connection, but I am not sure how to do it. Any suggestions how to set the header OR if that's not the problem here then what's going on ?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
