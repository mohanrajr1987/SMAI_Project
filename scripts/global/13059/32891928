<p>If a person logs into a website (<strong>Website A</strong>) and this website creates session variables, could another website (<strong>Website B</strong>) make a cURL call to a PHP routine on <strong>Website A</strong> that would send back to <strong>Website B</strong> a json variable with <strong>Website A</strong>'s session variables?</p>  <p>If so, how can I accomplish this?</p>  <p>This is the scenario I have in mind:</p>  <ol> <li>User visits <strong>Website A</strong> and logs in. This create session variables in <strong>Website B</strong></li> <li>In the same browser session, the user visits <strong>Website B</strong>.</li> <li>The homepage in <strong>Website B</strong> makes a cURL call to a specific routine in <strong>Website A</strong> that verifies if session variables exist and, if so, send their information back as JSon.</li> <li>Depending on the JSon variable content (if it exists), <strong>Website B</strong> shows the user a different content.</li> </ol>  <p>Is it doable through cURL?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
