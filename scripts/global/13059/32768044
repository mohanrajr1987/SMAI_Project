<p>I'm attempting to set up a same-page form submission mechanism for a client website. Their forms submit to a handler page which is on a different domain, so I cannot submit via ajax. Previously I have had success cloning my form into an iframe and submitting that (I don't need to retain control of the iframe, and I don't need to verify receipt, just post the data) but that is now being blocked in Chrome.</p>  <p>It would be relatively trivial to add cross-domain headers if I had control of the servers involved, but I don't.</p>  <p>Is there any way to resolve this, or do I have to tell my client that the method I was using is no longer available and they have no options without making server-side changes?</p>
