<p>I'm building a web app that uses http only cookie sent by the backend for session data. Now my backend is hosted at xyz.domain.com</p>  <p>My client side is domain.com (note - m not using www.domain.com ) </p>  <p>Now when the client receives cookie , the browser doesn't save it. In crome i saw the cookie isn't first party. </p>  <p>After doing a bit of research i figured out to send cookie with domain - .domain.com  Tried that. Didn't work. </p>  <p>How should this be done. </p>  <p>Thank you </p>
