<p>Upon launching the flex viewer client , URL gets changed from secured protocol (https://) to partial secured(https://) as the flex page loads.  I analyzed Network Inspector , Flex Viewer Client is invoking following 2 HTTP crossdomain.xml file for both HTTP and HTTPS flex viewer launch. Flex Client need to invoke crossdomain.xml file based on launch protocol. Can anyone please help.</p>
