<p>I am developing an Angular app that I started using the Yeoman generator and scaffolding. I am still using the default Gruntfile.js to run it. I am trying to implement the satellizer authentication system (<a href="https://github.com/sahat/satellizer" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sahat/satellizer</a>). My client side code is running on localhost:9000 and my server side is running at localhost:3000. Why can I not make a server call at localhost:3000 from my Angular running at localhost:9000? It seems like it should work... I have read that it should be <a href="http://localhost:9000" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9000</a> however Chrome automatically changes it to localhost:9000. The console outputs the following:</p>  <pre><code>XMLHttpRequest cannot load localhost:3000/auth/facebook. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource. </code></pre>
