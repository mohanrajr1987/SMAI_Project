<p>AJAX request from <a href="http://localhost:8080" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a> to <a href="http://foo.com" rel="nofollow">http://foo.com</a> in AngularJS app was failed because browsers don't let cross-site request and browser say:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Request header field Content-Type is not allowed by   Access-Control-Allow-Headers."</p> </blockquote>  <p>But there are another ways to solve using <strong>JSONP</strong> or may be writing extra code on server side but I don't want to do that for development phase.</p>  <p>Is there any alternative ways to make cross-site without any configuration on server side and any writing extra code in development phase (not production)?</p>
