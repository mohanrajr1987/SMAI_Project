<p>We would like to implement a same kind of functionality in php. The visitor puts an item in a basket on domain a, then surfs (by typing an address in the location bar) to domain b and there he sees the basket content from domain a still present and available for order.</p>  <p>How do you achieve this in php? How does site b know the identifier of his session on site a?</p>  <p>We looked at coolblue.be and gsmstore.be for inspiration but are clueless :D</p>
