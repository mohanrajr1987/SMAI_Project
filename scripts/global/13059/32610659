<p>having said that the script has always worked in the past days.</p>  <p>I've two different domains on the same server:</p>  <p>domain1.it</p>  <p>domain2.com</p>  <p>I do an ajax call from domain2 to domain1, this is my code:</p>  <pre><code>$.ajax({     url: 'http://www.domain1.it/search.php',     jsonp: "callback",     dataType: 'jsonp',     data: {         'name': 'blabla'     },     success: function(data) {         // do something     } }); </code></pre>  <p>After that, firebug says:</p>  <pre><code>"NetworkError: 500 Internal Server Error - http://www.domain1.it/search.php?callback=jQuery1113005074434191498345_1442410239829&amp;name=blabla&amp;_=1442410239830" </code></pre>  <p>The curious thing is that if I try to get the previous link directly from the browser, I get the correct json object!</p>  <p>I think that perhaps may depend on server options, but I do not know what has changed in a few days.</p>  <p>I've also try to put 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*' but nothing happened.</p>  <p>Help me! :)</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
