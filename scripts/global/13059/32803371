<p>I need to inject a script into an iframe which content is on a different domain, but I keep getting script errors and exceptions because of the cross domain restrictions. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32719826/">How to inject javascript into an iframe with webbrowser control?</a>)</p>  <p>After some searching, I found that there are internet feature controls which should let me do just that without any restrictions. Those are <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#xd_capture_event" rel="nofollow">Cross Domain Capture Event</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#frame_contents" rel="nofollow">Frame Content Modification</a>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Internet Explorer 7 and later. By default, Internet Explorer prevents   frames from being changed by windows hosted on a different domain than   the one hosting the window containing the frame. This is a security   measure designed to prevent malicious sites from hijacking content   hosted by legitimate websites.</p>      <p>When enabled, the FEATURE_IE6_DEFAULT_FRAME_NAVIGATION_BEHAVIOR   feature <strong>allows frame content to be modified by windows hosted by any</strong>   <strong>domain</strong> except for those listed in the Restricted zone.</p>      <p>The FEATURE_BLOCK_SETCAPTURE_XDOMAIN feature prevents capture events   from being propagated to elements in webpages hosted on domains   different than the one hosting the page containing the element that   triggered the capture event.</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, even after enabling frame content modification and disabling cross domain capture event, I am still getting the same errors when attempting to modify an iframe. I also tried disabling the features <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330734%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#window_isolation" rel="nofollow">FEATURE_ISOLATE_NAMED_WINDOWS</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#xd_redirection" rel="nofollow">FEATURE_CROSS DOMAIN_REDIRECT_MITIGATION</a> without any luck.</p>  <p>Am I missing something?</p>
