<p>I'm trying to embed youtube's video's in my site.</p>  <p>Fortunately YouTube implements <a href="http://oembed.com/" rel="nofollow">Oembed</a> spec, but the problem is that I can't make calls to it from JS because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" rel="nofollow">same origin policy</a> and so browser blocks calls from <code>my.domain.com</code> to <code>http://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&amp;url=myurl</code>.</p>  <p>What I found is <a href="https://noembed.com/" rel="nofollow">Noembed</a> which seems to me a build up upon this spec. It works fine. The question is can I use it as trusted service, does it have some downsides and can i use it permanently ?</p>
