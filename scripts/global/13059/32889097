<p>I am developing an OpenSocial gadget (JavaScript language) for RQM (Rational Quality Manager) that gets information from DWA (Doors Web Access). The gadget is running on RQM (https://:9443/) and I want to make request to the DWA (https://:8443/). </p>  <p>The gadget runs correctly in IE, but when I run in Firefox I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading &gt; the remote resource at https://&lt;host&gt;:8443/xxxx. (Reason: CORS header &gt; 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing). &lt;unknown&gt; Cross-Origin Request &gt; Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource &gt; at https://&lt;host&gt;:8443/xxxx. (Reason: CORS request failed). &lt;unknown&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What could be the issue and what can I do? Is there anything I can do on the client side?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
