<p><em>Disclaimer: This is more of a general interest question rather than something I am actually considering doing, since there are less hacky ways to achieve the same thing.</em></p>  <p>But, out of curiosity:</p>  <p>I can create custom <code>&lt;img ...&gt;</code> tags with JavaScript, which the browser will go and fetch. By choosing the URL for the <code>src</code> attribute of the image appropriately, this technically allows me to execute arbitrary server queries if my web server doesn't just return a static image file for the url-request, but actually processes it via some form of <code>GET</code>-servlet.</p>  <p>The beauty of this is that it can be used for cross-domain requests in pretty much any browser that supports images without opening yourself up for any of the vulnerabilities that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" rel="nofollow">JSONP</a> would, for example.</p>  <p>The problem is that I cannot return any data from this sort of server query, since the cross-domain policies usually block any sort of pixel-access to the image...</p>  <p>Or can I?</p>  <p>I should be able to at least return two small unsigned integers in the range of 1 to maybe 1000  or more by generating a blank image with a certain width and height, which the browser then allows me to retrieve no matter where the image was loaded from, correct?</p>  <p>Are there other such tricks I can use to send even more information along with the image? And what limitations would I face in trying to get at the information?</p>  <p>As an example, could the server set a cookie when returning the image? If so, I could probably only access that cookie from the same domain, right? So it wouldn't be useful for cross-site-scripting (except if the client doesn't need to care about the info in the cookie, but the server does).</p>  <p>Or could I, as another example, somehow change the image's <code>src</code> by having the server reply with a redirect in such a way that I can retrieve the redirect-target in JavaScript?</p>  <p>Crazy ideas welcome! ;)</p>  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>  <p>This question is <strong>not</strong> meant as very broad (received close request?!?): There are only a very limited number of properties that an HTML <code>img</code> tag has that could be manipulated by a server and then read by a client. Image width and height might in fact be the only ones (at least I couldn't find any others). I'm just asking whether there are more. There should only be very few other properties out there, if any.</p>
