<p>Scenario: Mr. Smith joins my site FOO and logs in. Site BAR, on a different domain, has installed my widget. Mr. Smith visits site BAR and is permitted to use the widget only if he is a member of site FOO.</p>  <p>Since many sites can install my widget, how can Mr. Smith be spared the trouble of re-logging in wherever my widget is installed, if he is already logged into site FOO?</p>
