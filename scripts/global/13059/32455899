<p>My application has huge issues with <code>internet explorer 9</code> and below. Because their default settings are that they do not allow access to data across domains.</p>  <p>I feel like I've attempted everything and because each of my clients have their own domain, I am unable to make the hack that makes an iframe.</p>  <p>So my question is:</p>  <p>Is there a way that you can prompt the user to set the setting: <code>access data sources across domains</code> to <code>enabled</code>?</p>
