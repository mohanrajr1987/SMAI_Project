<p>I have two code snippets:</p>  <pre><code>$.getJSON("https://noembed.com/embed", {"format": "json", "url": input.val()}, function (data) { // work with data }); </code></pre>  <p>The second one:</p>  <pre><code>$.getJSON("https://www.youtube.com/oembed", {"format": "json", "url": input.val()}, function (data) { // work with data }); </code></pre>  <p>The first one will be successful, but the second one not. They were both sent from <code>http://localhost:8080/myapp/page</code>. Why does the same origin policy not permit both requests? (Actually it's question about browsers).</p>
