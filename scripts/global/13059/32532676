<p>I have an iFrame on my webpage that is from the <em>same origin</em> as its parent page. I'm loading page into there that has a bunch of <code>img</code>, <code>script</code>, <code>link</code>, etc. tags in it that all have <em>relative</em> <code>src</code>s such as <code>src="/imgs/img.jpeg"</code> as opposed to <code>src="http://mywebsite.com/imgs/img.jpeg"</code>. </p>  <p>What I want is for all of those resources to go to another server. So instead of hitting <code>http://mywebsite.com/imgs/img.jpeg</code> I want them to hit <code>http://yahoo.com/imgs/img.jpeg</code> or other website.</p>  <p>Is there a way to change the "base URL" or whatever of the iFrame so that all the relative <code>src</code>s will hit another website and get those resources, using javascript?</p>  <p>Are there some cross-origin policies this would violate? Definite answers please, no speculation...</p>  <p>And is there a better way than to brute-force change all the <code>src</code>s in the DOM and hack it all up...</p>  <p>Thanks y'all!</p>
