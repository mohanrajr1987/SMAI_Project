<p>In my application, I am populating information in UI from sqlite database using recyclerview. I had implemented infinite scroll using limit, offset sqlite queries which after query result populate POJOs for recyclerview. However, now I also need to implement a fast scroll feature which would by principle will be against pagination for lazy loading purpose. I am wondering what will be best architecture to achieve both simultaneously. I dont want to load all objects from database in POJO's in the beginning for lesser start time but eventually need a fast scroll over all content.</p>
