<p>I'm trying to download package System.Data.Sqlite with EF6 support via stock NuGet in Visual Studio 2015 Community. After pressing "Install", I'm getting asked for dependencies. Then, after confirming, nothing happens for a while and then, in the Output window, I get "Object reference not set to instance of object" error. I upgraded NuGet to 3.2.x, but the problem persists. What can I do to resolve it?</p>
