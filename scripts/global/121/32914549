<p>I am using SQLLite with MS SQL Reporting Services via SQL Lite ODBC. The reports are quite complex and causes too many disk reads, sometimes taking over 5 minutes to generate a report. In order the improve performance, tried to do the following:</p>  <p>Restoring the database file (or its backup) into a in memory database and then ran the query </p>  <pre> > .restore c:/mypath/a.db;  > select * from mytable; </pre>  <p>Works great command line, but ODBC tells me that I cannot execute these two commands at once.</p>  <p>Is there a way with SQLite ODBC that I can pin a SQLite DB In memory to overcome disk read issues?</p>
