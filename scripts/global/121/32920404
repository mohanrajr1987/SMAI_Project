<p>Hi I'm new to android studio and looking for some answers</p>  <p>I'm currently creating an app that has a SQLite database, the user can add/edit/delete data accordingly</p>  <p>What I want is if the user adds a entry to their database on their phone, if they then go on their tablet the new entry will get synced and be displayed and vice versa </p>  <p>Is there a standard / recommended way of doing this?</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
