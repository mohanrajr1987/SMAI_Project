<p>I am currently trying to make a logon system, just to learn some more advanced python script. </p>  <p>Originally, I was using <code>.txt</code> files to save all of the information, but that ended up being messy and unsecured.</p>  <p>After I completed the first set of script, I decided to try saving the information to a database file. I have figured out how to read data from the table but it comes out with <code>[(''),]</code> around it. </p>  <p>This is an issue because, I need to use the raw data to compare to an input, which cannot be done with the symbols around it. </p>  <p>So, I was wondering if it is possible to read the data as a raw string, without the symbols. I have been doing this in a separate file to the main project. Here is the contents of said file:</p>  <pre><code>import sqlite3 as sql  con = sql.connect(r"E:\Users.db") c = con.cursor() con.row_factory = sql.Row username = input("What is your username: ")  readdata = input("Select the message you wish to read: ") c.execute("SELECT * FROM Mail WHERE (Subject LIKE '"+readdata+"') AND   (Recipient LIKE '"+username+"')")  component = c.fetchall()  for row in component:     c.execute("SELECT Recipient FROM Mail WHERE (Subject LIKE '"+readdata+"') AND (Recipient LIKE '"+username+"')")     rc = list(c.fetchall())     rec = str(rc)     c.execute("SELECT Sender FROM Mail WHERE (Subject LIKE '"+readdata+"') AND (Recipient LIKE '"+username+"')")     snt = list(c.fetchall())     sent = str(snt)     c.execute("SELECT Subject FROM Mail WHERE (Subject LIKE '"+readdata+"') AND (Recipient LIKE '"+username+"')")     sbject = list(c.fetchall())     subject = str(sbject)     c.execute("SELECT Message FROM Mail WHERE (Subject LIKE '"+readdata+"') AND (Recipient LIKE '"+username+"')")     mg = list(c.fetchall())     msg = str(mg)      print()     print("Sender: " + sent)     print("Recipient: " + rec)     print("Subject: " + subject)     print()     print("Message: " + msg) </code></pre>  <p>And here is the output:</p>  <pre><code>What is your username: James Select the message you wish to read: LOL  Sender: [('Kieran',)] Recipient: [('James',)] Subject: [('LOL',)]  Message: [('Hey',)] </code></pre>  <p>This is all the correct data, but I need to remove the <code>[(''),]</code> to be able to compare it. I am using Python 3.4.2.</p>
