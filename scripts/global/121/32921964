<p>I am new to android and developing my first app. I have an application which shows various topics in a list view and the user can set an alarm/reminder on each list item and the application sends a notification at that time using alarm manager, broadcast receiver and notification manager. </p>  <p>I m able to develop this functionality. However now i want create an activity which shows all the reminders set by the user and give functionality of deleting or editing the existing reminders.</p>  <p>However i am not sure how to save these alarms and show them in list activity. I have searched a lot on internet and there are suggestions to use SQLite or shared preference.</p>  <p>If someone can guide the best way to do it or have any resource regarding it,please share it</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
