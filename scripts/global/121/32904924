<p>Here's the table in question,</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2ZWNV.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2ZWNV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What I am trying to do is to get the count of entries segregated by type for each person(claimed_by). For example, for example,</p>  <p>John : Total entries :4 , Type 1 entries: 1, Type 2 entries : 3.</p>  <p>Jane : Total entries :4 , Type 1 entries: 4, Type 2 entries : 0.</p>  <p>Here's what I have at the moment,</p>  <pre><code>SELECT count(id) as total_entry,claimed_by, (select count(id) from tblIssues where type=1) as type1_entry, (select count(id) from tblIssues where type=2) as type2_entry  FROM tblIssues  GROUP BY claimed_by  order by count(id) desc </code></pre>  <p>This return correct value for total_entry but incorrect for type1 and type2. I think this is because I am not doing a group_by in the sub query but I am not sure how to correctly do that.</p>
