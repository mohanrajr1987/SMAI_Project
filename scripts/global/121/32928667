<p>I'm making an app to store records of several users, and I want to be able to access the records once in a while (as in pull the .sql file). I'm currently using an SQLite database but the default location is in the /data folder which can be accessed for the emulator but not for a physical device, unless it is rooted. I cannot root the physical device so is there any way to change where the database is stored in the device so that I can easily access it later?</p>
