<p>i am new to SQLite. I want to display the name of each employee and his/her manager's name. But i am a little confused about how to link the managerID with EmployeeID? Do i need to use subquery? </p>  <pre><code>table: Employee Columns: EmployeeID [pk], EmployeeName, ManagerID </code></pre>  <p>Like:</p>  <pre><code>EmployeeID    EmployeeName   ManagerID   1              Alice          2   2              Peter         null   3              John           2   4              Mary           1 </code></pre>  <p>means Peter is Alice and John's manager and Alice is Mary's manager.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT EmployeeName AS Employee, EmployeeName AS Manager FROM Employee WHERE   </code></pre>
