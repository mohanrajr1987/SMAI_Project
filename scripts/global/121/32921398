<p>I just started learning Phonegap and got the basic "hello world" app running. I'm building the app for Android and iOS. However support for Windows and Blackberry would be awesome too.</p>  <p>I need to create a pre-populated offline database app with listing in alphabetical order, Detailed view, next &amp; prev button and search function. Nothing more.</p>  <p>I found this but no idea how or where to start: <a href="https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage</a></p>  <p>Is there any working example of phonegap that I can download and start from there?</p>
