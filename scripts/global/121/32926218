<p>I want to create an app with a sqlite db with 3 columns:  title of the album name of the song personal rating.</p>  <p>The users can scroll trough the preloaded list of albums, then only the preloaded songs of that album are displayed, and the user can rate the song (and change his/her personal rating any time). In a further stage I will fine tune the app so the the user is able to select a list of "personal great songs" "personal good songs" etc.</p>  <p>Is there any specific description out there to do this or a sample apk?</p>
