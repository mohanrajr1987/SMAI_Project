<p>I'm creating a Django (1.8) web application that lets end-users search entries. I've managed to let users get search results according to their input. </p>  <p>However, I also want users to be able to order the search results after the results are returned, according to the user's selection of some choices (e.g. order by distance, order by rating, order by price). I'm having trouble implementing that because I can't figure out the logic behind this. </p>  <p>Could someone please tell me how to implement such feature please? Thank you very much!</p>
