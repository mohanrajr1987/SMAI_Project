<p>I have created a view where I have a few fields that are set up as embedded views using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_field_view" rel="nofollow">Views Field View</a> Module. The views I have embedded however are set up to replace they're fields with a simple yes or no. I have used exposed filters on all of the other fields and they work fine. I was wondering if there is any way to set up an exposed filter on these embedded views however so a user can filter based on if the value of these fields is yes or no.</p>
