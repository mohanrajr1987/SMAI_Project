<p>Let's say I want a text sent to me whenever certain requirements come in, the word "yellow", "blue", and "orange" exists in the text, etc. I know how I can check for this in normal code, but I'm unsure how I go about setting up something that auto checks the email inbox everytime a new email comes in, and how to go about sending a text automatically whenever that happens? I'd like it to have the least amount of delay possible. </p>  <p>If someone has already created this (I did search Google and here) and I'm just missing wherever it is, please let me know. If there's a wheel, I'd love to not recreate it... </p>
