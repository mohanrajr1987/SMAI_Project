<p>I need to add the header in each response. I am planning to do below</p>  <pre><code>public class MyFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {      @Override     protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request,                                     HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)             throws ServletException, IOException {          filterChain.doFilter(request, response);             response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");      }  } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to do it after <code>filterChain.doFilter(request, response)</code> so that once controller process it, i just add header before returning to client. Is it correct ?</p>  <p>But As per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5634477/how-to-write-response-filter">How to write response filter?</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>After <code>chain.doFilter</code> has returned, it's too late to do anything with   the response. At this point, entire response was already sent to the   client and your code has no access to it.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Above statement does not look right to me. Can't i add header after <code>filterChain.doFilter(request, response)</code> ? If not why ?</p>  <p>i am using spring mvc.</p>
