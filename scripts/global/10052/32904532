<p>Does anybody have any idea how to add a <code>post-process/outbound</code> filter to Restlet? </p>  <p>There seems to be a bug in the Restlet system that sets the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin â†’ *</code> regardless of what I set it to in the inbound <code>CorsFilter</code>. I don't quite understand why but the best solution I can come up with at this time is to set a filter that is executed after whatever code in Restlet is reseting that value.</p>  <p>However I don't seem to be having much luck. I assume I should be working with the following...</p>  <pre><code>@Override public Restlet createOutboundRoot() {    ... } </code></pre>  <p>However I currently am struggling to get anything I place in there to execute.</p>
