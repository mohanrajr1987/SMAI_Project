<p>I would like to know if there any app for Django(Oscar ecommerce) that would filter product by atributes, the main problem here is to display products only with specified/selected atributes from dropdown-menu, and second problem is that these selectors(of attributes) need to work together(so it would be like ex:Show a <code>List</code> of Product <code>'A'</code> of <code>attrTypeColor = 'Black'</code> where <code>attrTypeSize = 'Small'</code>, so it would display me only products with specified color and size. Thing is that that in oscar there is allrdy some sort of category worker <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8i0bk4n.png?1" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/8i0bk4n.png?1</a> , but problem is that its only sorting products, by Start/End position, so if i want most rated product it would pull all product with best rating from start(left) to end by each. But i need it to display those products, problem is i dont rly know the structure of django, if there is no apps for filtering, maybe someone can give me a idea of how it should be, a bit explained idea! thx !</p>
