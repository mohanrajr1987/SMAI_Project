<p>I have an array list of purchase details having a purchaseID , purchaseCategory . The purchaseCategory is another string array which details the products under that purchaseID. I am trying to filter , the main array list based on an item inside the purchaseCategory in swift. The following is the sample code </p>  <pre><code>let purchaseList = [["purchaseId":1 ,"purchaseCategory" : ["meatballs" ,"burger","cheese" ,"onions" , "apples"]],["purchaseId":2 ,"purchaseCategory" : ["apple","orange" , "olive" , "cheese"]],["purchaseId":3,"purchaseCategory" : ["apple","orange" , "olive" , "cheese" , "Pepsi"]]] </code></pre>  <p>How do we filter the purchaseList to return only details purchaseCategory having "olive"</p>
