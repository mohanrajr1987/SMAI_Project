<p>Is it possible to use multiple filters with a curl request? For example, <code>curl -s --request GET -u "apiusername":"apikey" https://store.mybigcommerce.com/api/v2/orders.json?min_date_created=date&amp;status_id=11</code></p>  <p>This obviously doesn't work, since it won't read past the date; the idea being able to filter out just certain order statuses from the list of outputs rather than having to get the entire list and filter afterwards.</p>  <p>Thanks for any assistance.</p>  <p>-Edward</p>
