<p>I have an unusual situation for a report. I only want to display rows for  several accounts (170, 171, 200, 380) if the Cost Center is either A480 or A485. All other accounts should be displayed for all cost centers. If one of the above accounts appears on any other cost center, then it should NOT be displayed in the report. </p>  <p>I thought I may need an expression like “='A480' or 'A485' for the Value field (using IN) but I’m not sure what the Expression field should look like.  I'm doing this all within Report Builder. </p>  <p>My report returns data for a number of accounts for a number of cost centers.  For example: Account Numbers: 123 / 125 / 130 / 140 / 145 / 170 / 171 / 200 / 380</p>  <p>What I would like the report to do is only display accounts 170 / 171 / 200 / 380 for Cost Centers A480 and A485.</p>  <p>Sample Results:</p>  <pre><code>Cost Center A400: 123 / 125 / 130 / 140 / 145  Cost Center A440: 123 / 125 / 130 / 140 / 145  Cost Center A480: 123 / 125 / 130 / 140 / 145 / 170 / 171 / 200 / 380 Cost Center A485: 123 / 125 / 130 / 140 / 145 / 170 / 171 / 200 / 380 Cost Center A500: 123 / 125 / 130 / 140 / 145  </code></pre>  <p>Accounts 170 / 171 / 200 / 380 should only be displayed if the Cost Center is A480 or A485. The report has a prompt for Cost Center. Some of the other Cost Centers will have results for accounts 170 / 171 / 200 / 380 but the user doesn't want to see these accounts in the any Cost Center other than A480 or A485.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help........</p>
