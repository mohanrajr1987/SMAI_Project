<p>I have a list of numbers repeated horizontally using ng-repeat. At the end of the  last number, there is a div where I wish to display the sum of all numbers. How can I do it using filter on screen. Is this possible at all.</p>  <p>I know the way of binding it by a variable in JS. But I want to achieve it in template itself. something like:</p>  <p>Total{{sum(n in repeatedarray)}}</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
