<p>My project has started using java 8 from java 7. </p>  <p>After switching to java 8, we are seeing issues like the memory consumed is getting higher  with time.</p>  <p>It seems that the java 8 garbage collection is not working properly.</p>  <p>When we switch back to java 7, the memory consumption again gets back to normal. We have explored 3 different version of java 8 and facing issues in all of those versions. </p>  <p>As java 8 has done some changes with GC. Removing permanent Gen is one of those changes. But those changes are supposed to lessen the memory consumption but we are facing the reverse!!</p>  <p>I just wanted to know has anyone else has faced this issue, or any thoughts on how can we resolve this??</p>  <p>EDIT : As of now we are monitoring <strong>"private bytes" consumed which increases while using java 8</strong>, and also we are observing this issue <strong>only while using RMI</strong>.</p>
