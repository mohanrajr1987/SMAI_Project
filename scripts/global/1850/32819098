<p>When I'm working with a set of non-struct object-object dictionaries (<code>Dictionary&lt;ClassA,ClassB&gt;</code>) will I do the GC a favor when I call <code>Clear()</code> on all of them?</p>  <p>Or more interresting: <strong>Could it do any harm to the GC when I do this?</strong></p>  <p>All objects including the dictionaries are expected to be in generation 2 since it's a long running transformation which will also generate a large amount of short and medium lived helper objects.</p>  <p>Update for the comments: The objects itself are mainly loaded by an EntityFramework context (so the dictionary is not the GC root) and the dictionaries are not resused since used in a context class like so:</p>  <pre><code>internal sealed class TransformationContext : IDisposable {    private readonly Dictionary&lt;ClassA,ClassB&gt; dict1 = new ...;    private readonly Dictionary&lt;ClassC,ClassD&gt; dict2 = new ...;    private readonly Dictionary&lt;ClassE,ClassF&gt; dict3 = new ...;     public void Dispose() // class is sealed, classic Dispose-pattern not needed    {      dict1.Clear();      dict2.Clear();      dict3.Clear();    } }  using(var context = new TransformationContext(some, input, values))   [...] </code></pre>
