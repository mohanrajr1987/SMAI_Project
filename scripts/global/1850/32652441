<p>I have multiple instances of a certain viewmodel. This viewmodel has an object of a videoPlayer i created, and event handlers (propertychanged, etc).</p>  <p>I realized viewing the performance monitor that when i created new instances the private memory goes up. But then when i close that viewmodels (Removing the reference i have for them in other class) the memory is still high.</p>  <p>I did a heap memory dump to see why GC does not clean them and I see the event handlers. Well i did a method to unregister them and saw what happen to the memory heap, the viewmodels are still there but the event handler references dissapear.  So i dont know what instances of viewModels are still there.  From the Paths to Root option (where i saw the references to event handlers) now I only see cycled dependencies. What things i can search?? For other viewModels without the videoPLayer object when i remove the eventHandlers the GC clean them.</p>  <p>So i think that something happen with that object. Bu i don't see nothing in Path To Root.</p>
