<p>I have an app which displays grid of thumbnails. The app decodes the input stream to bitmap with <code>BitmapFactory.decodeStream()</code> for each thumbnail in order to display it.<br/><br/> I noticed that GC if super active when I scroll up/down fast enough, which makes the scrolling jerky.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VqUJU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VqUJU.png" alt="Systrace dump"></a> <br><br/> I tried to isolate the problem and wrote a simple app where I do 10000 decodeStream() calls in a loop and noticed that even though there is enough of memory, the GC is still getting triggered constantly (even if I call bitmap.recycle() after each iteration).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/p34Z2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/p34Z2.png" alt="RAM"></a></p>  <p><b>Question: how to prevent GC from being too active while executing <code>BitmapFactory.decodeStream()</code>?</b></p>
