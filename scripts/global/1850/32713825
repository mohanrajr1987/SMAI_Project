<p>According to <a href="http://nodered.org" rel="nofollow">Node-RED</a>:</p>  <p>“The new Garbage Collector (GC) algorithm in node.js v0.10.x behaves differently than v0.8.x – in that it doesn’t enforce a clean until it is near a memory limit larger than the 512MB in the Pi – this can cause the Pi to crash if left running for a long time”, excerpted from nodered website.</p>  <pre><code>• Is that true?  • Does this apply to Raspberry pi only or generally speaking? • How does this affect the Nod.js systems stability? • Finally, what can be done to prevent this? </code></pre>
