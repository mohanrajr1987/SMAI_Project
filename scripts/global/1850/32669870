<p>I've started programming erlang recently and there are a few things I want to understand regarding GC. As far as I understand there is a generational GC for the private heap of each process and a reference counting GC for the global shared heap. What I would like to know is if there is anyway to get:</p>  <ol> <li>How many number of collection cycles?</li> <li>How many bytes are allocated and deallocated, on a global level or process level?</li> <li>What are the private heaps, and shared heap sizes? And can we define this as a GC parameter? </li> <li>How long does it take to collect garbage? The % of time needed?</li> <li>Is there a way to run a program without GC?</li> </ol>  <p>Is there a way to get this kind of information, either with code or using some command when I run an erlang program?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
