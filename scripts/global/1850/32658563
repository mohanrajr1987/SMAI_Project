<p>I am not much aware of memory management, garbage collector and how threads allocate and deallocate memory in java. I am working on a core java application which parses a binary file and keeps it in memory from there we save the data to DB. But, as the data in the binary file is increased it's exceeding the heap limit and generating dump.</p>  <p>Threads are being used in this I see that the memory is not getting decreased after the thread complition also. Could you please provide some information on this or some link where I can find some material regarding to memory management, GC and thread memory management.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Shyam Kishore</p>
