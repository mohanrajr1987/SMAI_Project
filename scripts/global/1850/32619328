<p>There is no realloc in OCaml memory.h or alloc.h (byterun/caml). Does that mean that is not possible to realloc an OCaml GC block (or value)? The use-case I'm thinking of is string concat, where the following can be optimized using realloc:</p>  <pre><code>a = a ^ b </code></pre>  <p>In my benchmarks, string concat is actually faster in PHP (5.5) than native-compiled OCaml (4.02.1).</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong>: In another benchmark, <code>Buffer</code> is <em>much</em> faster than PHP concat, and still faster than OCaml concat <em>even</em> when converting the buffer to string in every loop iteration. <a href="http://pastebin.com/wV6HUw93" rel="nofollow">Code</a>.</p>
