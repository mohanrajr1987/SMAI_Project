<p>In Java, we can use the method <code>System.gc()</code> to <strong>suggest</strong> a GC. Today I got to know the method GC.Collect() in C# from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y46kxc5e.aspx" rel="nofollow">this link</a>.  But the explanation is somewhat unclear to me.</p>  <p>The first line.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Forces</strong> an immediate garbage collection from generation 0 through a   specified generation.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And the other line.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Use this method to <strong>try to</strong> reclaim memory that is inaccessible.</p> </blockquote>  <p>In my simple test code, GC.Collect() works immediately.</p>  <pre><code>Console.WriteLine("abcdefg"); GC.Collect(2); GC.Collect(2); Console.WriteLine(GC.GetGeneration("abcdefg")); </code></pre>  <p><strong>GC.Collect() always forces a GC immediately?</strong></p>  <p>Or just a suggestion like in Java?</p>  <p>This is not a question about "I want to force a GC in C#", I just want to know how it works.</p>
