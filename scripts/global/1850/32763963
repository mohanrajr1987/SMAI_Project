<p>We had latency problem in our system and it was root caused to full GC being run every hour. We explicitly disable full GC, using JVM parameter(DisableExplicitGC) and the issue was solved. Later we figure out explicit GC was called by RMI.</p>  <p>So the question is what is the reason RMI has been configured to run full GC every 1 hour(<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/sunrmiproperties.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/sunrmiproperties.html</a>) based on the property "sun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval"? Why default GC logic not enough able to handle RMI?</p>
