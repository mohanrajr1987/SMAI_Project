<p>I'm reading the article explains how Java Garbage Collector works.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/gc01/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/gc01/index.html</a></p>  <p>In the above article, it said that by adopting the concept of generation for the Heap, the performance of Garbage collector can be enhanced. I am kind of confused. Why splitting the heap to different generations gives better performance? Is the reason that the Garbage Collector only needs to process part of the heap, saying young generation each time? For the Tenured and Permanent generations, when should the Garbage Collector process them? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0mAEd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0mAEd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
