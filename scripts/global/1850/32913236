<p>I have set session max lifetime to 86400, but it destroys earlier. Also it destroys when I close browser:</p>  <pre><code>ini_set("session.gc_maxlifetime", 86400); </code></pre>  <p>Question: What can be the problem ?  Also: I can not access my website sometimes during a day. It actually destroys after when I could not access the website. Browser shows: Error connection timed out.</p>
