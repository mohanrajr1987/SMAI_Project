<p>I have recently been taking over a website-project where I now have a couple of websites to administer. the only problem is that i have to manually go into the ftp in order for me to delete the php-session files from the tmp in the root-map. So for instance if our websites are down, usually this means that there are too many session files, and that these must be deleted immediately in order for the sites to get up running normally again. </p>  <p>I have contacted the developer who is in charge of the code optimization of the websites, and he have been telling me for a couple of weeks now that this problem should be solved and that he will get to it, but that writing the code for making the session files to delete automatically, is a complicated process and the it takes time. </p>  <p>Since I am not a programmer and have very limited knowledge about PHP, I don't really have a clue if this problem is hard to solve or not. I did a bit of Googling on the subject thought and it seems that the code for automatic deletion is rather simple. Am I right? </p>  <p>Really grateful for help! </p>  <p>Kind regards!</p>
