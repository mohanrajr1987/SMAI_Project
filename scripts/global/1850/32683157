<p>I am running a video playback which only has video in it without any audio content in it. We are using OMXCodec and Awesomeplayer combination for the playback. </p>  <p>What i observe in the systrace and log file is that a very longish GC_explicit getting called by system server process on behalf of postVideoEvent_l() function of media server process.This can be seen in the systrace i am attaching below. Also the logs have GC_EXPLICIT calls just before frame drops(cancel buffers). These GC calls are lasting for around 100-200 ms. </p>  <p>Any particular reason for these Explicit GC calls.</p>  <p>Attached is the location of the Systrace: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/znxpgz9qhpjmc1e/mytrace5.html?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/znxpgz9qhpjmc1e/mytrace5.html?dl=0</a></p>  <p>One example instance of the above can be seen from 9300ms to 9450ms. This duration is followed by a slew of cancel buffer calls.</p>  <p>Logcat too has following messages during above said interval:</p>  <pre><code>D/dalvikvm( 2052): **GC_EXPLICIT** freed 31K, 11% free 6518K/7280K, paused **18ms+16ms, total 124ms** E/AwesomePlayer(  813): we're late by 124714 us (0.12 secs) dropping one after 52 frames E/AwesomePlayer(  813): getting release from here 22222 E/OMXCodec(  813): cancel Buffer to native window  E/OMXCodec(  813): [OMX.hantro.G1.video.decoder] **Calling cancelBuffer** on buffer 0xb6ff927c </code></pre>  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
