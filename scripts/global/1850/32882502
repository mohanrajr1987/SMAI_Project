<p>I've a WCF which is called by a ASP.NET application every 10-15 Minutes to inform customer via email about stuff. I need the collection to recognize to which user the mail already has been sent. So if the next call is coming in i can query this collection if the mail was send before and when was the last time (i set an interval so the user doesn't get the mail every 10-15 minutes). </p>  <p>My question is - when i store it global does this collection expire when the call ends (collection = empty)?  Is it enough to set this global collection in .svc class as static List or do i have to set the DataMember attribute? How would the code look for that?</p>  <p>Like that?</p>  <pre><code>public class Service1 : IService1 {       private static List&lt;customer&gt; lastSendUserList = new List&lt;customer&gt;();        void SendMail(int customerid)       {            lastSendUserList.FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.id == customerid);            .            // proof date etc. here and send or send not       } } </code></pre>  <p>Does this <code>lastSendUserList</code>stay in ram/cache until i set it to <code>null</code> (or server restart etc.) so i can query it every time the call comes in? Or does this list gets cleared by gc everytime when the call ends?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>So the new Code would look like this?!</p>  <pre><code>public class Service1 : IService1 {       private static List&lt;customer&gt; lastSendUserList = new List&lt;customer&gt;();        void SendMail(int customerid, int setInterval)       {            customer c;            c = lastSendUserList.FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.id == customerid);             if(c != null &amp;&amp; c.lastSendDate + setInterval &gt; DateTime.Now)            {                 lastSendUserList.Remove(x =&gt; x.id == c.id);                  // start with sending EMAIL                  lastSendUserList.Add(new customer() { id = customerid, lastSendDate = DateTime.Now });             }       } } </code></pre>
