<p>I have this piece of code, and I am confused about when the Object o becomes eligible for garbage collection in Java.</p>  <pre><code>    public class JustSo     {         public static void main(String[] args)         {              for(int i=0;i&lt;4;i++)              {                      Object o=new Object();                      //o.doSomething();              }              System.out.println("DONE");         }     } </code></pre>  <p>Since it is inside  a loop(or any block for that matter), it will become eligible at the end of the loop right? </p>  <p>But I found an answer on a reliable developer site(Don't want to disclose where) that says the earliest the object becomes eligible is at the print statement.</p>  <p>Please clarify.</p>
