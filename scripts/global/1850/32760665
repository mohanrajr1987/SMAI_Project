<p>When I was trying to create relationships in millions of flights and airports, I got this message <code>GC overhead limit exceeded in neo4j</code>. I am currently working on my standalone PC with <code>4GB RAM</code> and <code>Processor Intel(R) Core(TM)i3</code>. I thought that may be this reason is due to shortage of RAM memory.</p>  <p>So what advice could you give me to solve this problem?</p>  <p>Thanks, your cooperation is truly appreciated!</p>  <p>sams</p>
