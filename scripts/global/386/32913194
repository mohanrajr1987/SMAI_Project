<p>I am in the process of setting up the rhc client tools to connect to openshift.  During 'rhc setup', it is suppose to generate the ssh keys under:</p>  <p>C:\Users[User].ssh</p>  <p>However, this .ssh folder is being used for another connection and my preference is not to change this folder.  Is it possible to somehow specify a different location for ssh keys generation during rhc setup?  During rhc setup, I was not asked where to generate the keys and I also looked in .openshift\express.conf and I see only the configurations for ssl; not ssh.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
