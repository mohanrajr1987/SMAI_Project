<p>I'm trying to use Packer to <a href="http://www.packer.io/docs/builders/virtualbox-iso.html" rel="nofollow">build a Vagrant box from an ISO</a>, using a  <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases" rel="nofollow">boot2docker ISO</a>.  All goes well until I try to run vagrant up, which fails with "Error: Authentication failure. Retrying...".  The box is OK - I can get in with vagrant ssh by supplying a password.  But ssh authentication doesn't work.</p>  <p>This turns out to be a known problem with a <a href="http://superuser.com/a/745998/499251">known solution</a> - add a public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on the box.   If I do this manually after I've accessed the box with a password, I don't need the password for future access.  So I updated my Packer script to do that - and found that changes made to the boot volume are discarded without effect.  Packer script changes to other volumes work, but not to the boot volume, which is the one I need to update.  It looks like it can only ever be an image of the ISO.</p>  <p>Is my only option to create my own ISO with the public key preinstalled?  Is there any way to use Packer to apply the key to the output box?</p>
