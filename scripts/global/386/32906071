<p>How is it possible to compile packages for Cygwin? I want to use the second factor authentication for SSH. So I need the packages libpam-otpw and otpw-bin for cygwin. Is is possible to compile these Debian packages for Cygwin, because the packages are not in the official cygwin sources.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/otpw.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/otpw.html</a></p>
