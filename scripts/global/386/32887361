<p>I am using a ~/.ssh/config file to proxy through a server to another one using ssh/sftp (on Yosemite). This works using the terminal.<br> In Filezilla in the SFTP config it says that the ssh-agent of the system can be used, but it does not state how this can be configured? How is this done?<br> Even if it is possible to configure the proxy in filezilla it would be better to do it only once, as the config also contains shortcuts.</p>
