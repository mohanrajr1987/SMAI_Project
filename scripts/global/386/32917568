<p>I have one problem I have no ssh access to the server, so I cannot use php artisan, composer and other commands.<br> As I can quess they do nothing other than modifying files or just copying php src files to specific directories.<br> In order to understand that process better and because of no access via ssh to the server I am looking for tutroial, manual or an article how can I perform this commands manually.<br> For example I need to execute   </p>  <p><code>php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\JWTAuthServiceProvider"</code> </p>  <p>What should I do in this case, it would be grate to find some document describes what should I do manually to get the same result. </p>
