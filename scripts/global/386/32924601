<p>Lets say I've added a ssh public key to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.  And I'm sshing into the machine from my client machine using <code>ssh -i &lt;private_key&gt; root@machine.ip.com</code>.  Is there a way to programmatically find the corresponding (accepting) public key to my ssh key from <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> after the ssh?  I'm assuming I have multiple keys in authorized_keys.</p>
