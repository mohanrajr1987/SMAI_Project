<p>I am using C# and Renci.SshNet to open an SFTP connection. I can get the attributes of files just fine, including the owner and group of the file. They are integers however, and figuring out what the user can do requires knowing their user id and group id. This is being done from a Windows machine, so that information is not readily available. How do I get the user id and group id without having the user manually run <code>id -u</code> and <code>id -g</code> on a *nix machine?</p>
