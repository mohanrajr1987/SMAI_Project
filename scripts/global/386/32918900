<p>I'm trying to make a bash script that behaves differently based on the terminal program that someone is using (Putty, mobaxterm, etc). Is there any way to retrieve this kind of information from a bash script? </p>  <p>I was searching around online but I was not able to find anything (or I'm just wording it incorrectly, which could be a distinct possibility).</p>  <p>thank you</p>
