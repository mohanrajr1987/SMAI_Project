<p>Is it possible to connect using the RDP protocol (and rdesktop) to a Windows Server 2012 computer, without have a GUI?</p>  <p>I am trying to remotely run a script, like I would on a Unix system, and I don't want a X11 windows popping up while this being done.</p>  <p>Alternatively, I guess I would have to install an SSH server on the Windows computer - are there any recommendation (preferably open source)?</p>  <p>Or are there any other suggestion on how to do this without RDP or SSH?</p>
