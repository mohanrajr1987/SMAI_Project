<p>I'm connected to a VM on a private network at address 'abc.def.com' using <code>ssh</code>, and on that VM there's an application that hosts a Python web app (IPython Notebook) that I can access by pointing my local browser to 'abc.def.com:7777'.</p>  <p>From that web app I can call shell commands by preceding them with '!', for example <code>!ls -lt</code> will list the files in the VM current working directory.  But since I'm using my own laptop's browser, I think I should be able to run shell commands on my local files as well.  How would I do that?</p>  <p>If that's not possible, what Python/shell command can I run from within the web app to automatically get my laptop's IP address to use things like <code>scp</code>?  I know how to get my IP address, but I'd like to create a program that will automatically enable scp for whoever uses it.</p>
