<p>I am using Hydra v8.1 downloaded and compiled from a tar file. I've managed to solve the standard problem of libssh support and now when I try to make an attack(I think it's called dictionary attack) on an SSH server, after specifying the following command:</p>  <pre><code>hydra -l {username} -s {port} -P /Users/{UserName}/Desktop/{file}.txt {ip} ssh </code></pre>  <p>I get the following output:</p>  <pre><code>Hydra v8.1 (c) 2014 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.  Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) starting at 2015-09-30 10:59:49 [WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4 [DATA] max 7 tasks per 1 server, overall 64 tasks, 7 login tries (l:1/p:7), ~0 tries per task [DATA] attacking service ssh on port {port} [ERROR] target ssh://{ip}:{port}/ does not support password authentication </code></pre>  <p>I have enabled support for the required libraries and I am running an OS X environment.</p>  <p>Can someone indicate a solution to this problem? Thank you.</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If I manually log in with the username and password, the authentication grants access to the server.</p>
