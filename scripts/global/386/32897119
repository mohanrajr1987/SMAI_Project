<p>I'm wondering is it possible to create this directory on a Windows machine <code>~/.ssh/id_dsa</code>? I have created a private key and wish to save it in a directory named <code>~/.ssh/id_dsa</code>. I've been told that <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code> this should work on the cmmand-line but unfortunately it does not. </p>
