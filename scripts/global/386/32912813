<p>I am experiencing some issues with the authentification on github.  (I work on a Mac).  I wanted to create a new account and start all over again but things got quite complicate. I have then reset my SSH key and abandonned the project of a new account. I apparently successfully authenticated myself when creating the new SSH-key on my old account. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5F5zR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5F5zR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have problems now when pushing from the <strong>github desktop</strong> and from <strong>rstudio</strong>. I have deleted and re-installed the desktop and sign up again but it still fails to authentification. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tJFx8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tJFx8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I experience the same issue with Rstudio even though the link to my new SSH-key seem to be correct. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4omSC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4omSC.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I <code>ls -al ~/.ssh</code> I get this </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PjIJC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PjIJC.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Do you see something irregular here ? How can I remove the old <code>githubt_rsa</code>? It may be this that causes the issues. </p>  <p>Any help is very welcome. </p>
