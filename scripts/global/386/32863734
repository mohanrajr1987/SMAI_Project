<p>I've got a problem with SSH. Yesterday I reinstalled Linux because of a Bug, that I couldn't fix.</p>  <p>Now I tried to pull a Git Repository and it doesn't respond. Then I tried to connect to my Root-Server via SSH and that does not respond too.</p>  <p>There isn't coming any response. It looks like, there is something working in the background but I can leave it for hours like that with nothing happening.</p>  <p>I then tried to pull the same repository on Windows or connect to my server (via SSH too). That worked without any problems. </p>  <p>A friend gave me the hint to disable IPv6 that didn't help. I tried to reinstall ssh, openssh-server. That didn't help too. If I remove my .ssh directory and then try to pull the repository, git asks me if I want to trust the Identity (same if I try to connnect via SSH). Then it asks me for a Password of "git@***" but when I create a ssh key it is like before.</p>  <p>It looks like this (can't post directly because of reputation level): <a href="http://i.epvpimg.com/ES8Sf.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.epvpimg.com/ES8Sf.png</a></p>  <p>I also tried pulling via <em>git pull origin master</em> and if I execute <em>git remote show origin</em> it is doing the same like pull fetch. All other functions that do something to my local repository are possible.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>Now its returning this (reinstalled everything, ssh, openssh-server, etc.):</p>  <pre><code>Timeout, server ***** not responding. fatal: Could not read from remote repository.  Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. </code></pre>  <p>It works from Windows. So the Access-Rights are correct.</p>
