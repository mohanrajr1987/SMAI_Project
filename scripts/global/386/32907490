<p>I am using a preconfigured Vagrant Box named <a href="https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-box" rel="nofollow">scotch-box</a> and want to run <code>expressjs</code> there.</p>  <p>The first thing I did is to <code>npm install -g express-generator</code> and when I try to run it on my browser, it doesn't work because the IP Address of the Vagrant Box is always <code>http://192.168.33.10/</code>. How can I make it work like just typing <code>localhost:3000</code> on my browser?</p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
