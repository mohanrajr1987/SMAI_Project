<p>I've seen this handy command to query a distant database from my local machine:</p>  <pre><code>ssh user@server 'mysql -uimauser -pPassWord imadb -e "select * from table"' </code></pre>  <p>But I wonder how safe it is? Can anyone capture the password? If so how?</p>  <p>I'm aware that this works well too:</p>  <pre><code>ssh user@server 'mysql -uimauser -p imadb -e "select * from table"' </code></pre>  <p>But for automation purpose, I would prefer the first solution (if safe of course). I've tried to capture the password with ps but I didn't see anything (my knowledge of ps is also very poor).</p>
