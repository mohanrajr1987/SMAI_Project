<p>I've searched the forums to find similar bugs but have not found a solution. I literally just deployed to my staging site 30 minutes ago. And now it is giving me an error. I've been using the same method for months now, so I have no idea what's changed.</p>  <p>Just running this Capistrano script:      <code>scripts/deploy staging</code></p>  <p>And I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>The deploy has failed with an error:    #&lt;SSHKit::Runner::ExecuteError: Exception while executing on host xxxx: Connection refused - connect(2)&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Clearly an ssh issue. But why would it be working one second, then not the next? </p>  <p>I also don't want to mess anything up on my production server.</p>
