<p>I have a basic Node/Loopback example going but I want to hit a hosted DB (semi-production ... not mission critical) I have control over vs. setup a local MySQL envt.</p>  <p>I want this to be done securely ... so I'm looking at locking down via IP, setting up SSL/SSH, etc.  Would love a VPN but looks like an SSH workspace is the preferred method? <a href="https://c9.io/blog/digitalocean/" rel="nofollow">https://c9.io/blog/digitalocean/</a>  ... this is for paid plans only though</p>  <p>Just wondering if there is a simple way to do this for POC</p>
