<p>I am been getting this error with Xcode 7.0.1 uploading to iTunes Connect:</p>  <p><strong>The session's status is FAILED and the error description is 'failed to open ssh session. (16)'</strong></p>  <p>Seems to be a network issue (ssh) and the fact that I can upload from my home network.</p>  <p>I've used the Network Utility and it appears as if these are open:</p>  <ul> <li>itmsdav.apple.com:443</li> <li>contentdelivery.itunes.apple.com:443</li> <li>idmsa.apple.com:443</li> </ul>  <p>However, I am not entirely convinced.</p>  <p>Also I've tried Application Loader using only DAV transfer protocol and get this:</p>  <p><strong>An error occurred uploading to the App Store</strong></p>  <p>I've also tried setting <strong>https.proxyPort = 80</strong> located in:</p>  <pre><code> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Application Loader.app/Contents/itms/java/lib/net.properties </code></pre>  <p>Nothing seems to work. All of this started after upgrading to both Yosemite and Xcode 7 (about 2 weeks ago).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any clues,</p>  <p>Roger</p>
