<p>I want to execute commands on remote server via ssh, but if I execute the following shell script, the commands is executed on local server.</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; "cmd.txt"   if [ `ls -1U "/home/" | wc -l` -gt "0" ]; then     echo "not empty!"   fi EOF cmd=`cat "cmd.txt"` rm "cmd.txt"  ssh root@127.0.0.1 "${cmd}" </code></pre>  <p>The reason why it does happen is inside of back-quote (<code>``</code>) commands are evaluated before passing variable to ssh option.</p>  <p>I also tried quoting with single-quote (<code>''</code>) or curly braces (<code>{}</code>) like the following:</p>  <pre><code>if [ '`ls -1U "/home/" | wc -l`' -gt "0" ]; then  if [ {`ls -1U "/home/" | wc -l`} -gt "0" ]; then </code></pre>  <p>but the result is the same before.(and without `` will be test command's (<code>[</code>) error with too many arguments) How can I fix this? Do you have any ideas? Please help me.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
