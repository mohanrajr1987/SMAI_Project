<p>I am thinking about a bash script that can login to 10 servers one by one, execute some task and save the output in a common file in the source server from which I am logging into the servers. To be more clear, I am using a test server 'test'and I need to login to other servers such as server1,server2,...server10 using ssh. Once I logged in successfully, execute some command, say cat /root/serverstatus and save the output to a common file in the 'test' server in a file named serverstatus.txt. I have ssh keygen is already installed and no password is required to enter to these servers. Thanks in advance.</p>
