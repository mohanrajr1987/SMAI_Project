<p>I am using Nginx with php-fpm and memcached, my nginx was working perfectly before and I was not using sessions in my script 10 days ago i updated my script and started to use session, for session i used memcache, but after this update my nginx and php-fpm are giving lot of error. My website is running on cloud server which have 2 core cpu and 2gb RAM and have average of ~480 concurrent users on website. After installation of memcached my cpu usage is increased 10%.</p>  <p>Since two days i got 95 of these errors in my php-fpm error log.</p>  <pre><code>[19-Aug-2015 22:33:05] WARNING: [pool www] seems busy (you may need to increase pm.start_servers, or pm.min/max_spare_servers), spawning 32 children, there are 4 idle, and 49 total children [19-Aug-2015 22:33:06] WARNING: [pool www] server reached pm.max_children setting (50), consider raising it [20-Aug-2015 01:32:37] WARNING: [pool www] child 14293 exited on signal 9 (SIGKILL) after 36091.050170 seconds from start [20-Aug-2015 01:32:37] NOTICE: [pool www] child 19144 started </code></pre>  <p>In nginx error log i am getting these errors.</p>  <pre><code>recv() failed (104: Connection reset by peer) while reading response header from upstream  upstream timed out (110: Connection timed out) while reading response header from upstream  connect() to unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock failed (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) while connecting to upstream </code></pre>  <p>This is my Nginx configuration;</p>  <pre><code>user              nginx; worker_processes  2; worker_rlimit_nofile 30000; error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log; pid        /var/run/nginx.pid; events {     worker_connections  2048; } http {     include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;     default_type  application/octet-stream;     log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '                       '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '                       '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';      access_log  off;     sendfile        on;     keepalive_timeout  65;     include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;  } </code></pre>  <p>And this is Memcached configuration,</p>  <pre><code>USER="memcached" MAXCONN="5024" CACHESIZE="100" OPTIONS="" </code></pre>  <p>please tell What is the problem in this ? and how can i solve it.</p>
