<p>I am using Memcached/Memcache to store key/value pairs from HTML forms. However, in my final version of the web server, I realized that these key/value pairs are actually unique, i.e. only one copy of these key value pairs resides in the memory. If one user stores them, the other user will see the same values. I want different users to write and read what they store to memcache, instead of reading global variables.  What do I need to do to fix this problem?</p>
