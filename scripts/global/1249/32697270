<p>These are our settings under nginx configuration of pagespeed:</p>  <pre><code>pagespeed FileCachePath "/var/cache/ngx_pagespeed/"; pagespeed FileCacheSizeKb 102400; pagespeed FileCacheCleanIntervalMs 3600000; pagespeed FileCacheInodeLimit 500000; pagespeed LRUCacheKbPerProcess 8192; pagespeed LRUCacheByteLimit 16384;     pagespeed MemcachedServers "127.0.0.1:11211"; pagespeed MemcachedTimeoutUs 100000; </code></pre>  <p>However, after so many days out hit rate for memcached continues to be about 35% and memory usage is around 3 GB out of allocated 5 GB.</p>  <p>Where are we going wrong? Why the cache is not getting generated with misses around 65%?</p>  <p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
