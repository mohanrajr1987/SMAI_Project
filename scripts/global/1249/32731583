<p>We are using Nginx + php-fpm + memcached.  Our php-fpm process cpu gradually increasing with under normal traffic and enough memory. Once php-fpm process is gracefully restarted its cpu is reduced less that 1%. Within 24 hour it will reach to 40%.  </p>  <p>I am suspecting issue was due to memcached module. Because same configuration without memcached issues not happen.      </p>  <h1>nginx -v</h1>  <p>nginx version: nginx/1.6.2</p>  <h1>php -v</h1>  <p>PHP 5.6.9-0+deb8u1 (cli) (built: Jun  5 2015 11:03:27)  Copyright (c) 1997-2015 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.6.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2015 Zend Technologies     with Zend OPcache v7.0.4-dev, Copyright (c) 1999-2015, by Zend Technologies</p>  <h1>php -m | grep memcached</h1>  <p>memcached</p>  <p>Please see the php-fpm pool configuration,</p>  <pre><code>pm = dynamic pm.max_children = 30 pm.start_servers = 9 pm.min_spare_servers = 4 pm.max_spare_servers = 14  request_terminate_timeout = 100 rlimit_files = 131072  rlimit_core = unlimited </code></pre>  <p>Please see the nginx fastcgi configuration,</p>  <pre><code>        include fastcgi_params;         fastcgi_connect_timeout 60;         fastcgi_send_timeout 100;         fastcgi_read_timeout 100;         fastcgi_buffers 24 32k;         fastcgi_buffer_size 32k;         fastcgi_busy_buffers_size 32k;         fastcgi_temp_file_write_size 32k;         fastcgi_index index.php;         fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;         fastcgi_pass php; </code></pre>  <p>Do you have any idea how to solve this issue.</p>
