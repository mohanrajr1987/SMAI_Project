<p>I want to store an array in Cache. I'm using "MemCached" as Cache driver and it works like a charm in queries, but I want to use it for my search suggestions. I've been looking at Laravel Documentation (<a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/cache" rel="nofollow">http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/cache</a>) but I haven't been able to find what I were looking for.</p>  <p>For example, I have this function in which if I find the element on Cache I get it. If not, I get results from DB and then store them on Cache for 10 minutes:</p>  <pre><code>public function get_suggestions() {        if(Cache::get('search_suggestions')) {         return $search_suggestions;       } else {         $search_suggestions = Suggestions::get();         Cache::put('search_suggestions', '$search_suggestions', 10);         return $search_suggestions;           }  } </code></pre>  <p>Some questions:</p>  <ol> <li>If the element in Cache expires, what will the Cache::get function returns?</li> <li>There is a function to check if the element exists in the database but is there anyone to check if the Cache item has expires?</li> <li>Is my approach OK to manage the Cache?</li> </ol>
