<p>MySQL 5.6.19a - Uppercase V appearing in first field written via add or set command. This is not in the originating data set. Example columns "user key" and "role" end up with email@address.com and Vadmin as values when admin was submitted as the value for role.  </p>  <p>containers table has user_key as the key_columns entry and role|email . . . as value_columns entries. This is not a consistent problem. I'm at a loss as to where this value is coming from.</p>  <p>python-memcached is the module being used for access.</p>
