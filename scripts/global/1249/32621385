<p>I am working on OSX 10.10.5, using AMPPS 3.2, PHP 5.6. I am trying to install memcached to work with PHP but no luck so far.</p>  <p>What I have done so far:</p>  <ul> <li>I have installed downloading the sources</li> <li>Using homebrew (also update it)</li> <li>Using pecl</li> </ul>  <p>First time I tried I got an error about architecture did not match, then I realized that the PHP version with AMPPS is 32bits and OSX is 64bits so I added this flag: CFLAGS='-arch i386' which solved that issue but now I got another errors:</p>  <pre><code>memcached support =&gt; enabled Version =&gt; 2.2.0 dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _memcached_lib_version   Referenced from: /Applications/AMPPS/php-5.6/lib/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20131226/memcached.so   Expected in: flat namespace  dyld: Symbol not found: _memcached_lib_version   Referenced from: /Applications/AMPPS/php-5.6/lib/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20131226/memcached.so   Expected in: flat namespace </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
