<p>Basically I had the same problem as this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9625768/memcachedgetstats-not-working-with-couchbase">thread</a> </p>  <p>And I am using php memcached 2.20, libmemcached 1.0.16, Couchbase 3.1.0. (memcached client received server version is 2.1.1).</p>  <p>I had no problem with setting and retrieving key and value. But getStats just return false when I am connecting to couchbase.</p>  <p>But getStats is works prefectly fine with Memcached server.... </p>
