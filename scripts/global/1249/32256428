<p>I have memcached 2.2.0 showing up on phpinfo, but I am unable to implement a project that utilizes this extension. I have been getting this Fatal error: Class 'Memcache' not found. I am running php 5.6.10.</p>  <p>I believe the memcached version might not be compatible with the current php version?</p>
