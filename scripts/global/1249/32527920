<p>Using memcached, I understand how/why using a small maximum size for entries is great for performance.  The default value (as of this writing) is 1 MB, although it allows for up to 128MB with a warning.</p>  <p>My issue is, we occasionally have entries that are 1.5 MB in size.  What happens if we attempt to load an entry that exceeds our maximum configured size? I suspect it simply bypasses the cache and logs a warning but I am not certain.</p>  <p>Additionally, can anyone see any glaring flaws to deliberately setting the maximum size below a known but rare event of encountering an entry greater than that maximum size, in order to get more efficient use of the memcached slabs?</p>
