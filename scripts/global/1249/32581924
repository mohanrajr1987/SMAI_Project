<p>I have a yii app running on server. Some of URL's are taking time to load (34 sec), on further debugging i found php session_start function took around 32 sec and rest script gets executed in less than 2 sec.</p>  <p>There are many request where session_start() is the only culprit. I searched on net and every one suggests it is something related </p>  <ul> <li>to session file handling of php (change it to DB and issue will get resolve)</li> <li>use session_write_close() after data is set in session.</li> </ul>  <p>But in my case Session is getting stored in couchbase, so first points does not seems to be valid. Can any one suggest the exact usage of session_write_close(), as data being is set in script at various location.</p>  <p>If any one has faced similar issues, please help</p>  <p>Any help would be greatfull.</p>
