<p>For my appengine app my memcache hit ratio is only 40 % and I use it extensively. Can I use appstats to profile my app to see why I don't get better hit rate? What would be a strategy to increase hit rate? Will hit rate rise when the app is used more? Can I profile my app more if I use some more performance profiling tool? Should I increase or decrease the number of items in memcache?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zFxMy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zFxMy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
