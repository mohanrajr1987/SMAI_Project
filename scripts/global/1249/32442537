<p>I have a PHP application running on the latest Nginx.  I would like to cache each full page for a specific URL using memcached and also have the ability to purge/invalidate a specific cached page with a few PHP commands.</p>  <p>My research suggests using these 2 modules:<br/> <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSRCacheModule" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSRCacheModule</a><br/> <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMemcModule" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMemcModule</a></p>  <p>Is that the best/easiest way?  Any other suggestions?</p>
