<p>I have a service that uses <code>@Cacheable</code> to cache the results of a method</p>  <pre><code>getRestaurants(Boolean closed)  @Override @Cacheable(value = "defaultCache", key = "#root.methodName.concat('-').concat(#closed") public List&lt;Restaurant&gt; getRestaurants(Boolean closed) { </code></pre>  <p>This method can be called with closed = null in order to return all restaurants.  This results in a null pointer exception.  </p>  <p>How do we add a condition to the key to allow for null values?</p>
