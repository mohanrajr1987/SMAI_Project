<p>I am running a local instance of memcached and using 3rd-Eden memcached library to interface with it. The cache is used to store some JSON data, but sometimes I want to append new fields to the objects, as only the needed information is pushed to the memory, so what I do is creating a new JSON object containing the new fields, say:</p>  <pre><code>var obj = {     bio: "blah" } </code></pre>  <p>and then call the <code>memcached.append(key, obj, callback_here)</code>. The problem is that this object is concatenated to the previous one, invalidating the JSON, so when I try to retrieve the stored data, I get the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>[{"service":"service1","id":"abc"},{"service":"service2","id":"zed"}]}{"bio":"bl                                                                   ^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token { </code></pre>  <p>I know that I can re-upload the whole new object, but this way seems to be more efficient.</p>
