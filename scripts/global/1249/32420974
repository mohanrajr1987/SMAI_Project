<p>I have two servers, and five domains on it. I would like to have one session for user on them, so i configure php.ini on both servers to use memcached as session handler (yes i also configure memcached server for accept connection from correctly ip). And it look fine. Storing session is on memcached server (keys of user session exists and after login have correctly data), but i don't know how to make one session for them. </p>  <p>When I call session_id() i have always different id, so i cannot identify user. </p>  <p>For any data i will be grateful. </p>  <p>PS. Servers base on Debian with php 5.6</p>
