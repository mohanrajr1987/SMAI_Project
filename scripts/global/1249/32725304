<p>I recently launched my app for iPhone/Android running with AppEngine backend. This is my first experience using AppEngine in Production.</p>  <p>As I get more traffic, I am starting to experience serious latency issues. Currently minimum idle instance is 1, max_pending_latency is 1s.</p>  <p>Yes, there are rooms for optimizations on my side, however I do not understand</p>  <ol> <li><p>Why the latency is not correlated with request/sec, traffic, memoryUsage, memcacheUsage, anything. I do not understand why there was no significant latency on Sep 21.</p></li> <li><p>Why the call to memcached needs to be as slow as 500ms. (Usually it is 10 times faster). I am using NDB and 1GB dedicated memcached. Increasing to 5GB had no effect.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Is this simply how AppEngine works? I would like to get your insight.</p>  <p>Thanks </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qcAwV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qcAwV.png" alt="Latency"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wCUmd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wCUmd.png" alt="Requests per second"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aChmv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aChmv.png" alt="Example RPC"></a></p>
