<p>I'm a Memcached beginner.</p>  <p>In my application is possibile that some memcahed items are created and never deleted.</p>  <p>I'm trying to figure out if it would be somehow better to always put an expiration time while creating new items.</p>  <p>The official wiki says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>When Are Items Evicted</strong><br>   Items are evicted if they have not expired (an expiration time of 0 or some time in the future), the slab class is completely out of free chunks, and there are no free pages to assign to a slab class.</p>      <p><strong>How the LRU Decides What to Evict</strong><br>   Memory is also reclaimed when it's time to store a new item. If there are no free chunks, and no free pages in the appropriate slab class, memcached will look at the end of the LRU for an item to "reclaim". It will search the last few items in the tail for one which has already been expired, and is thus free for reuse. If it cannot find an expired item however, it will "evict" one which has not yet expired. This is then noted in several statistical counters.</p>      <p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewUserInternals" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewUserInternals</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>To me this means that if some items are a abandoned without an expiration time, memcached will automatically reuse them if memory is needed.</p>  <p>So, is there any advange to always set an expiration time?</p>
