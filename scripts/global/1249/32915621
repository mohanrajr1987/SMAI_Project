<p>I'm interested in knowing you can give better performance to fetch data from the database in a PHP environment.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Is it better to use a system cache (disk or memory) to any requests to MySQL?</p></li> <li><p>What is better, memcached or disk cache?</p></li> <li><p>if memcached is not available, it would be good to use disk cache requests for mysql, or would be better to let go straight to the database server?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Regards, Jhon.</p>
