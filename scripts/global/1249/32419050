<p>I see the following error in my application after starting to use Dalli &amp; Memcached:</p>  <pre><code>Cache read: account_statuses_for_environment_6 DalliError: Unable to unmarshal value: undefined class/module Status Cache generate: account_statuses_for_environment_6   Status Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "statuses".* FROM "statuses" WHERE "statuses"."merchant_id" = 6 Cache write: account_statuses_for_environment_6 </code></pre>  <p>Weirdly, this will just sometimes work (aka <em>marshal</em> the value, whatever that really means).</p>  <p>Does anyone know of a solution?  My model is called:</p>  <pre><code>class Status &lt; ActiveRecord::Base </code></pre>  <p>The table is 'statuses' - it works very well to retrieve records.  I don't know why the caching situation doesn't work for this model.  There are a few other models that don't work with the cache either, but most just work.</p>
