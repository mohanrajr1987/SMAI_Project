<p>I'm trying to compile git 2.5.2 on RHEL6 into my home directory and it requires a perl module ExtUtils::MakeMaker. ExtUtils::MakeMaker isn't installed in the standard locations and installing packages (via yum) is impossible due to organizational limitations.</p>  <p>ExtUtils::MakeMaker requires Test::Harness, which also isn't installed. Test::Harness depends on ExtUtils::MakeMaker, is there a way to break this dependency or a way to compile git without depending on ExtUtils::MakeMaker?</p>  <p>Output when trying to install ExtUtils::MakeMaker:</p>  <pre><code>Using included version of CPAN::Meta (2.120351) because it is not already installed.
