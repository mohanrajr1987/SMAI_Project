<pre><code>Use of uninitialized value $encoding in string eq at     /var/www/mailing-tool/perl/MaillingTool/Deploy.pm line 190 (#1)     (W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already     defined.  It was interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.     To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.      To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you the     name of the variable (if any) that was undefined. In some cases it cannot     do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the undefined value     in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program and the operation     displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear literally in your     program.  For example, "that $foo" is usually optimized into "that "     . $foo, and the warning will refer to the concatenation (.) operator,     even though there is no . in your program.  Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at     /var/www/mailing-tool/perl/MaillingTool/Deploy.pm line 622 (#1)  print() on closed filehandle FILE at     /var/www/mailing-tool/perl/MaillingTool/Pmta/PmtaFileMaker.pm line 127 (#2)     (W closed) The filehandle you're printing on got itself closed sometime     before now.  Check your control flow. </code></pre>
