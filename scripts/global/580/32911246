<p>I have a list of 500 files or so of messy data sets (.csv) that look like the following:</p>  <pre><code>0.00, 0.53, 1.53, 0.00 0.52, 243.21  ... etc etc.  </code></pre>  <p>I would like:</p>  <pre><code>0.00, 0.53, 1.53, 0.00, 0.52, 243.21  </code></pre>  <p>In perl (or bash), how would I match everything after a decimal, and, IF there is <strong>whitespace</strong> followed by another <strong>number</strong>, then I would insert a comma after the first number? </p>  <p>i.e. <code>0.00 0.52</code> into <code>0.00, 0.52</code></p>  <p>I'm a beginner to perl and programming in general, so I'm not quite understanding how to use this correctly. I found that the regex <code>[0-9]+(\.[0-9][0-9]?)?</code>should work for two decimal places, but what about more decimals? Is it simply <code>[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+?)?</code></p>  <p>My unsuccessful attempt: </p>  <pre><code>for my $file (glob '*.csv') {     open my $in, '&lt;', $file;             my @lines;     while (&lt;$in&gt;) {         while(/^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$/g){             print ",";      # Am I overwritting my lines here?           }         $line =~ s/,,/,/g; # Get rid of any double commas that appear now     }     close $in;     open my $out, '&gt;', $file;     print $out $_ for @lines;     close $out; } </code></pre>  <p>I think I am not matching/printing correctly -- any help is appreciated, including more elegant solutions.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
