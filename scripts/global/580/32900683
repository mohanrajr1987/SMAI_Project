<p>I am using the below code to sent the mail and it was working fine before I moved it another server.</p>  <pre><code>my $fsendmail = '/usr/sbin/sendmail -t'; #... open(MAIL,"|$fsendmail") or die "Cannot open $fsendmail: $!";       print MAIL "Subject: $sub\n\n";     print MAIL "From: $data{'Email'}\n";     print MAIL "To: $to\n";      print MAIL "Content-type: text/html\n\n";      print MAIL "Here is the result of your web feedback form.\n\n";      foreach my $name ( @names ) {         my @values = $query-&gt;param( $name );         if (param($name) ne '') {             print MAIL $name . " = " . (join ", ", @values) . "\n";         }     }      print MAIL "\n";     close (MAIL); </code></pre>  <p>The given code is not working now nor displaying any errors that causes the email from sending. Is there anything in the server that needs to be enabled to sent the mail. Please let me know.  Thanks in advance.</p>
