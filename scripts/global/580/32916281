<p>I'm trying to run the example in this website <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/perl/perl_socket.htm" rel="nofollow">tutorialspoint</a></p>  <p>But it's very slow. I thought it had something to do with buffering the response but changing print for syswrite did nothing so I added some debugging messages and found out that the function gethostbyaddr takes around 10 seconds to resolve. </p>  <p>I know there are other modules for socket programming but I was wondering if this problem is common. </p>  <p>I am running everything on localhost and I am using a mac </p>
