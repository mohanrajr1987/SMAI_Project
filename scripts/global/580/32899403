<p>For websites that rely on Ajax or javascript to render data, how can I use WWW::Selenium to save the data? My following code was able to perform all the clicks and get to the correct webpage, however it did not save the data (I mean the list of all contests) because it is not in the html source code. I tried $sel->get_body_text() but it did not work either. Can you help me save the rendered data to a txt file or htm file? Thank you.</p>  <pre><code>use WWW::Selenium;  open (FO, "&gt;test.htm"); my $sel = WWW::Selenium-&gt;new( host =&gt; "localhost",                               port =&gt; 4444,                               browser =&gt; "*firefox",                               browser_url =&gt; "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/",                             );  $sel-&gt;start; $sel-&gt;open("https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/"); $sel-&gt;click("all-switch"); $sel-&gt;click("completed"); print FO $sel-&gt;get_html_source(); print "Done\n"; </code></pre>
