<p>I'm having trouble converting the following code from Perl to PHP. In particular, I'm having trouble with this section, as I have no clue what is happening here:</p>  <pre><code>sub md5sum($) { my @ib = unpack("C*", shift); my $encstr = join("", map {sprintf('\%3.3o', $_)} @ib); my ($out) = split(/ /, `printf '$encstr' | md5sum`); return $out; } </code></pre>  <p>The main point I'm looking for help on is what does the <code>"C*", shift</code> do in the unpack statement, what's going on in the <code>join</code> part, and what does the <code>| md5sum</code> do at the end of the <code>split</code></p>  <p>For this section below, I believe I'm also having trouble. My main question here is for the php pack, do I specify the H32, or just the H?</p>  <pre><code>$hexchal  = pack "H32", $challenge; $newchal = pack "H32", md5sum($hexchal . $uamsecret); my $passvar = ""; $passvar = md5sum("\0" . $password . $newchal); </code></pre>  <p>Here is what I've tried for the section above, but the $hexchal's don't match up</p>  <pre><code>$hexchal = pack("H32", $challenge); $newchal = md5($hexchal.$uamsecret); $passvar = md5("\0".$password.$newchal); </code></pre>  <p>Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
