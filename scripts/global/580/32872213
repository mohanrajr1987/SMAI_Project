<p>I want to do command line argument parsing for a directory path in perl. I want to make this argument as optional.  so when the user gives path, it showed be assigned to a variable $release_model else it will execute other code I have written for finding directory from main directory. I am new to perl but somehow coded following. Can anybody help? </p>  <pre><code>Getopt::Long my $command_line = $GetOptions(\%Opts, "help|h","email=s@","test","model"); if($command_line==0){ print "$PROGRAM: no arguments are given"; Usage{}; } else die "No arguments were given"  </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't accept model as optional argument and throws error.  </p>  <p>I just started working with perl. </p>
