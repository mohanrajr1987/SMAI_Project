<p>I'm trying to use a PCRE that selects everything EXCEPT the first string of numbers in a line of text. The number string can be 3, 4, or 5 digits long, but is always the second word after article. Here are some examples:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>article 11367 airline experts incheon airport transfers operational expertise indonesia</p>      <p>article 8364 future investment korean government invest 4 trillion won science technology ict rd</p>      <p>article 2151 fighter procurement lockheed martin able propose lower prices f 35s</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am currently using the expression <code>\b(?=\w*[a-zA-Z])\w+\b</code>. This selects everything but the numbers. This is almost perfect, but as you can see in lines 2 and 3 above, sometimes numbers occur after the first set. I want to select every word except the second, or ignore the first set of numbers but include the others, so that in the end the matched result looks like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>article airline experts incheon airport transfers operational expertise indonesia</p>      <p>article future investment korean government invest 4 trillion won science technology ict rd</p>      <p>article fighter procurement lockheed martin able propose lower prices f 35s</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm doing this because the Drupal module search404 includes a PCRE string in its configuration that selects everything you want to <em>eliminate</em> from the search string. It also includes a function to automatically conduct a custom search URL with the search terms, and lets you construct the URL. I want to construct the URL so that it looks like /node/number, which will automatically send the user from the old article URL (one of the lines above) to the new article URL.</p>
