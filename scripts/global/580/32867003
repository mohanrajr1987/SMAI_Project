<p>Am writing a script in shell and I've a variable like this -</p>  <pre><code>$ grep A41A41 file A41A41  06 </code></pre>  <p>I want to grep a particular string combination as shown above and increment the number associated to the string (in the same line after 2 spaces) by 1. And leave rest of the file as it is (File will have some 800 rows). <strong>09 should become 10 and 99 should become 01.</strong> Also, A41A41 will be a variable and in the <em>for</em> loop the value of this variable will change in every iteration I am doing all this in a for loop so I also need to consider performance of incrementing.</p>  <p>Appreciate your help in solving this problem.</p>
