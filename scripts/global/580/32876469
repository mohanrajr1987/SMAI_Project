<p>Given the sample string below I'm trying to capture the 'to', 'from', 'subject' and 'type' fields and spit them back out in a different format.  The issue is that these fields (to, from, etc) can be in any order.    </p>  <p>SAMPLE STRING TO REGEX ON</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cfmail to="#toAddr#" from="#fromAddress"    subject="#subject#" type="html"&gt;     #emailMsg# &lt;/cfmail&gt; </code></pre>  <p>OUTPUT I'M LOOKING FOR</p>  <pre><code>to:toAddr, from:fromAddress, subject:subject </code></pre>  <p>If I knew that the order of those field I'm interested in was always the same then this is pretty easy, but I'm stumped on how to do this matching if, for instance, 'from' comes before 'to'</p>  <p>The perl one-liner I have right now is (just testing with 'to' and 'subject')</p>  <pre><code>s/&lt;cfmail.*?((to)="(.*?)")|((subject)="(.*?)").*&lt;\/cfmail&gt;/\1:\2, \3:\4/g </code></pre>  <p>This ends up matching the 'to' value but stops there and I don't get anything for the 'subject' value.  I've tried several variations on this where I change matching group setup etc but have had no luck on it.  Any help or nudge in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.</p>
