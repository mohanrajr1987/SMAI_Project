<p>I want to call a perl <a href="https://github.com/cmhughes/latexindent.pl/blob/master/latexindent.pl" rel="nofollow">script</a> using java script, and pass a java script variable? This script is already written by someone else. I just want their script on some text then output the results on my website. The problem is the script requires a file as input. </p>  <p>The perl script has the following usage</p>  <pre><code>latexindent.pl [options] [file][.tex] </code></pre>  <p>I want to pass in a text box when I call this script, and return the commands printed to console to my javascript function.</p>  <pre><code>function ajax_info() {     $.ajax({         url:       "latexindent.pl",         cache:     false,         dataType:  "text",         data:      { mode: 'This is Some text!' },         success:   function(result) { ajax_info_result(result); }     }); }   function ajax_info_result(result) {     var text   = "The server says: &lt;b&gt;" + result + "&lt;/b&gt;";     $('#info').html(text); } </code></pre>
