<p>Hi I'm trying to write a simple script that takes 2 arguments and runs a perl script with the provided input</p>  <pre><code>agents=$1 group=$2 while read agent do perl perlscript.pl perlconfig.conf --update_agent $agent group_name $group   done &lt; $agents </code></pre>  <p>when I run this perl script on the command line with hand typed variables it works fine. However when running the script I get an error from the perl script that the update_agent command is expecting 3 arguments but is given 4. I can't seem to figure out where the 4th variable is coming from.  Any help is appreciated thanks</p>
