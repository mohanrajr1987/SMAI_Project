<p>I have a web app where when the user logs in i store the username in the session which is just a key/value pair attached in their cookies. </p>  <p>I am using Everbutton which is a 3rd party html button that allows easy Wepay payment processing. When a user clicks on the button to pay they are redirected through the Wepay process and then at the end they are then sent back to my site for confirmation. </p>  <p>My issue is that when they are redirected back to my site i am using the session to track who has paid and storing it in MySql. Whenever i test the feature it works fine but many users are getting errors where it can not find their session. Here is my login code and the payment processing code.</p>  <pre><code>    def authenticate = Action { implicit request =&gt;     loginForm.bindFromRequest.fold(       formWithErrors =&gt; BadRequest(html.login(formWithErrors, null)),       user =&gt; Redirect(routes.Application.index).withSession("email" -&gt; user._1)     )   }      def deposit(checkoutId: String) = Action {implicit request =&gt;     request.session.get("email").map { email =&gt;       User.findByEmail(email).map { user =&gt;         User.updateDeposit(user, checkoutId)         Redirect(routes.Application.index).flashing("success" -&gt; "We received your payment").withSession("email" -&gt; user.email)       }.getOrElse{         Redirect(routes.Application.index).flashing("error" -&gt; "We could not locate your account.Please contact walter.woodall.iv@gmail.com with the screen shot of your error").withSession("email" -&gt; email)       }     }.getOrElse{       Redirect(routes.Application.index).flashing("error" -&gt; "We could not validate your session. Please contact walter.woodall.iv@gmail.com with the screen shot of your error")     }   } </code></pre>  <p>Users must log in before they can pay so they should have a valid session.</p>  <p>I have been asking users about their browser and any plugins and what they did during payments. There is no pattern. People are getting the error on all browsers with no plugins. Really stuck here </p>
