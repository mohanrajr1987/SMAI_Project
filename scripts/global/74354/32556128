<p>I want to use <a href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com" rel="nofollow">http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com</a> as much as possible for javascript dependencies. But from a development perspective two things about this bother me. The first is minor: there's a lot of copy pasting and it looks ugly and filled with redundancy:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.13.3/react.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/quill/0.20.0/quill.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; ...etc. </code></pre>  <p>Secondly I'm worried about nested dependencies. For every library I reference like this I have to make sure that any dependencies it has are also provided, which means:</p>  <ul> <li>Finding out what the dependencies are (there might not be any but I need to verify that)</li> <li>Adding more tags for them</li> <li>Repeating the process for these dependencies themselves</li> <li>Managing versions for each library</li> <li>Keeping them in the correct order</li> </ul>  <p>I then also have to combine this with whatever methods I have for managing my own code and libraries that aren't available on cdnjs which might make things fragmented and more confusing.</p>  <p>If I serve the dependencies myself then there are tools like npm, bower, and grunt. Is there a similarly robust and easy way to manage externally hosted dependencies?</p>  <p>I'm using the Play Framework with Scala and ScalaJS, but I'm interested in solutions for all platforms.</p>
