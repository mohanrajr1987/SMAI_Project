<p>i'm having some troubles with tests in Intellij, i created a new project with</p>  <pre><code>activator new my-project </code></pre>  <p>then opened that projected with intellij, i marked all boxes for SBT to auto-download and create empty folders, etc.</p>  <p>Well after the project is opened and loaded all SBT stuff i have some errors.</p>  <p>First with versions:</p>  <pre><code>SBT project import      [warn] Multiple dependencies with the same organization/name but different versions. To avoid conflict, pick one version:      [warn]  * org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:(4.0.1, 4.3.4)      [warn]  * com.google.guava:guava:(18.0, 16.0.1)      [warn]  * junit:junit:(4.12, 4.11)      [warn]  * org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore:(4.0.1, 4.3.2)      [warn]  * commons-logging:commons-logging:(1.1.1, 1.1.3)      [warn]  * org.scala-lang.modules:scala-parser-combinators_2.11:(1.0.1, 1.0.3)      [warn]  * org.scala-lang.modules:scala-xml_2.11:(1.0.1, 1.0.3) </code></pre>  <p>then with the junit</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b6Ab6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b6Ab6.png" alt="SBT Root and Junit"></a></p>  <p>i looked up and there is some solutions to the vesion problem, but they didn't work for me and i have nothing about the junit thing.</p>  <p>Tests work on terminal but i can't have markdown in intellij</p>
