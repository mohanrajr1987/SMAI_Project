<p>Given the following string as input: </p>  <pre><code>/myproject/assets/%2Fmyproject-frontend%2Fstylesheets%2Fbase.css </code></pre>  <p>How can I use mod_rewrite to achieve this as output:</p>  <pre><code>/myproject/assets/myproject-frontend/stylesheets/base.css </code></pre>  <p><strong>Note: There is a "/" and "%2F" right next to each other in the input string. If there is a way to use mod-rewrite to replace all instances of "%2F" with "/" and also fix the "//" at assets//myproject-frontend, then that would be the ideal solution.</strong> </p>
