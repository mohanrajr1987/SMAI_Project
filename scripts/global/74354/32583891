<p>I was trying to implement my own method interceptors using annotations (Guice) in Play!. However, it seems like those annotations would only work (and therefore intercept) if the containing classes are created by Guice (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8862531/cant-get-guice-method-interception-to-work">reference</a>). That brings me to the question: How does @Transactional work outside of Controller classes in Play!? It is essentially a method interceptor, and it works fine no matter how the containing classes were created? I can use it within my models and service classes as well.</p>
