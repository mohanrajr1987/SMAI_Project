<p>I have a Play application (Play 2.2.3) where I configured my logging in a custom <code>conf/application-logger.xml</code> file (working fine during the execution of the application).</p>  <p>In addition I also need sometimes to run a script outside of the application, then I am using the command <code>run-main</code>. My problem is that my custom logging configuration is not taken when I am using run-main.</p>  <p>Do you know how can I force the using of my conf file or define another logging configuration file?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong><br> I also tried to specify the conf file in the play command, <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/SettingsLogger#Changing-the-logback-configuration-file" rel="nofollow">as described here</a>, without success:<br> <code>play "run-main my.package.MyClass -Dlogger.resource=conf/application-logger.xml"</code><br> .</p>
