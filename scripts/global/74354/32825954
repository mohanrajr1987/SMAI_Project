<p>I have a oneToMany relationship between two entities, ie. hotel has many rooms. When I use a fetch("rooms") in ebean the first entity is filled correctly with its children while the others appear "repeated". ie, hotel 1 -> room1, room2 and then I get the second entity hotel2 -> room3 , hotel2-> room4, hotel2 -> room5. </p>  <p>Much in the same fashion as this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20068478/ebean-finder-joins-onetomany-fields-in-a-strange-way-4-results-instead-of-2">Ebean Finder joins @OneToMany fields in a strange way (4 results instead of 2)</a> I debugged ebean and seeing how the checkForDifferentBean() method in CQuery.java works I understand how sorting the parent entity helped him. This has not helped me though. I am also using postgresql. </p>  <p>The ctx.getPersistenceContext() call for the first bean works, starting with the second the context goes empty, making checkForDifferentBean() return true.</p>
