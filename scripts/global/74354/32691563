<p>I have a Play application in an SBT project and I just integrated the Hibernate validator but it gives me a huge load of debug logging. I want to change the log level. My project has the typical play/sbt architecture : </p>  <pre><code>project ---app ---conf ---project ---target ---test ---build.sbt </code></pre>  <p>I checked hibernate dependencies it seems to use log4j. Does anyone nows what file I have to create and where to put it ? In the debug logs it seems to look for META-INF/validation.xml if it tells you something.</p>
