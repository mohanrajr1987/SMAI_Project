<p>i have a play project with multiple subprojects. It is possible to share classes from the app folder between subprojects which depends on each other. </p>  <p>I have a class with methods which should be executed before every test. I need this class for nearly every test class and it isn't practicable to have this class in every test folder for each subproject. Is it generally possible to share classes in the test folder?</p>  <p>I have tested this but it doesn't seem to work. IntelliJ doesn't show any error and it seems to recognize the class i want to use. But when i execute the tests, it shows me that it can't find the class.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your responses.</p>
