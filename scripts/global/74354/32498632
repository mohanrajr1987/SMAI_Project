<p>I was working on Web development project using Java, Scala, JPA, Ajax, HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. But now due to some problems like 'lack of resource persons on Play framework in my team' we have decided to move to the Springs/Hibenate framework. So we need to convert the complete project in Springs/Hibenate framework. So what are all the considerations to be taken care while doing the same? Whether to use Hibernate annotations or do we need to proceed only with hbm and xml files? We are using MySQL as a database. </p>
