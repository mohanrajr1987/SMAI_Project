<p>I am new to the Play! framework and was trying to pick it up recently. So I might be asking the wrong question here. But this is what I would like to do:</p>  <p>I created a template <code>play-scala</code> project from the <code>Activator</code> and there are both <code>my-project/build.sbt</code> and the <code>my-project/project/plugins.sbt</code>. I would like to list all of my dependencies inside the <code>project/plugins.sbt</code>. </p>  <p>e.g. I have this line already working when I put it in the <code>build.sbt</code>:</p>  <pre><code>libraryDependencies += "org.postgresql" % "postgresql" % "9.4-1201-jdbc41" </code></pre>  <p>But when I moved that line to the <code>project/plugins.sbt</code> when compiling I've got a compile error when trying to import above package. I tried to "debug" it with the Activator's command line typing <code>libraryDependencies</code> and that does not seem to be picked up. </p>  <p>Any ideas of how to make that work? </p>  <p>I ve also read another reference which seems to tell me that I should be able to just add more dependencies inside <code>project/plugins.sbt</code></p>  <p><a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.1/docs/Extending/Plugins.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.1/docs/Extending/Plugins.html</a></p>
