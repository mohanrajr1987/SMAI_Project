<p>Sup, i'm trying to deserialize form data with Play2 but i have encountered a little issue.</p>  <p>code: <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hajtosek/a355b800f334a584a547" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/Hajtosek/a355b800f334a584a547</a></p>  <pre><code>implicit val registerForm = Form(     mapping(       "name" -&gt; text,       "surname" -&gt; text,       "login" -&gt; text,       "password" -&gt; text,       "email" -&gt; text     )   )(User.apply)(User.unapply)   implicit val userFormat = Json.format[User] }  case class UserLoginData(login: String, password: String)  object User {   def apply(name: String, surname: String, login: String, password: String, email: String) =     new User(name, surname, login, password, email, List()) }  case class User(name: String, surname: String, login: String, password: String, email: String, skillSet: List[SkillRecord] = List()) {  } </code></pre>  <p>The data i get from the form is (String,String,String, String,String) but my case class needs (String,String,String, String,String, List[myCustomThing]).</p>  <p>When i hover over the red text in my ide the prompt says not enough arguments for method apply (String,String,String, String,String)</p>  <p>This is register form for my new project, i've tried to override apply in companion object but that didn't work either. I had also tried default values and Option's with similar result.Any suggestions?</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>Haito</p>
