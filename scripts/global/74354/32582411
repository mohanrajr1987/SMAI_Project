<p>I am using play framework and Apache Kafka.</p>  <p>I have a POST method which sends a message to Kafka. Kafka has an API method </p>  <p><a href="http://kafka.apache.org/082/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html#send%28org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord,%20org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Callback%29" rel="nofollow">public java.util.concurrent.Future send(ProducerRecord record,                                                         Callback callback)</a></p>  <p>of which the Javadoc says </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Asynchronously send a record to a topic and invoke the provided   callback when the send has been acknowledged.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am exposing this functionality using the play framework. I want to return a <code>Promise&lt;Result&gt;</code> from the Controller method but can't figure out how to implement this in a non-blocking way. Can someone help me with this?</p>
