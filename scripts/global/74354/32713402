<p>When running <code>activator dist</code>, <code>npm install</code> seems to executed automatically along with it in a step that appears in the logs as <code>[error] (web-assets:jseNpmNodeModules) Problems with NPM resolution. Aborting build.</code> In my setup this should not happen as the CD server where the build is running is not equipped to resolve all dependencies through npm. How can I disable this automatic behavior in sbt 0.13.8 with play plugin 2.4.2.</p>
