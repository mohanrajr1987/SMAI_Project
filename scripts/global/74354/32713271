<p>I have the following dropdown menu in my play(play for java, v2.3.4) template, how can I deactivate/disable it?</p>  <pre><code>@select(setupForm("locationType"), options(LocationType.options()),     '_label -&gt; "Type",     '_default -&gt; "Choose a type",     '_help -&gt; "ATTENTION: you CANNOT change the type later.", ) </code></pre>  <p><strong>P.S:</strong> I want it to be disabled, but still deliver it's value to the controller! I tried using javaScript to disable it, but when I disable it using JS, the value is not passed to the controller.</p>
