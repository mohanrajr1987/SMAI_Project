<p>I have Weblogic and JMS Queue. Also i developing application which will be deployed to multiple servers (cluster), so there would be multiple instance of this application. Applications will listen JMS queue and do some stuff with messages. </p>  <p>My question is: When i send a message in JMS Queue, and application instance A take this message, will application instance B retrieve this message also? So i need that all my applications will receive message from JMS.</p>
