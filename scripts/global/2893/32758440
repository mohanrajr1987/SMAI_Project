<p>I am trying to automate WLST script to uncheck "Automatically Acquire Lock and Activate Changes" and save changes. when i did it through WLST script recording it is recording only below lines.  </p>  <pre><code>startEdit() undo(defaultAnswer='y', unactivatedChanges='true') stopEdit('y') </code></pre>  <p>I can do it manually though admin console, but for me it is required through WLST script.</p>
