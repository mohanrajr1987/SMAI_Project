<p>I have deployed an ear file named abc.ear to weblogic 10.3.6. </p>  <p>Inside the ear file, there are several class files. The main Java class file is abc.class</p>  <p>Here I would like to ask if there is a way to tell the JVM to run a java method if I am undeploying / delete the abc.ear file from weblogic?</p>  <p>I want to unbind some JNDI in that Java method.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
