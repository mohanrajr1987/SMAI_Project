<p>I've received following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Server OLD_SERVER:6400 not found or server may be down (FWM 01003)   null</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have got full copy of productive server and new server name is <code>NEW_SERVER</code>. Also, I've created new CMS on this server and it's running well. But I've deployed war files to my development Weblogic server, created with JDeveloper, and they give me error above.</p>  <p>So how can I reconfigure Weblogic or this war files to look at <code>NEW_SERVER</code>? It seems like I should reinstall Business Objects and they will reconfigure automatically to look at my current server, but I hope to avoid this.</p>
