<p>In a JSF application, I am calling a REST service to obtain information. I have configured my application to run in HTTPS in my weblogic server. I have created my self signed certificate and configured a custom keystore in my weblogic.</p>  <p>When trying to call the REST service in my managed bean I am hitting below error</p>  <pre><code>javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: com.sun.jersey.api.client.ClientHandlerException: javax.net.ssl.SSLKeyException: [ Security:090477]Certificate chain received from &lt;myproxy&gt; - &lt;myip&gt; --&gt; &lt;externalsite&gt; was not trusted causing SSL handshake failure. </code></pre>  <p>I am passing thru a network proxy but I am just not sure how to fix this error.</p>  <p>Anyone have idea how to fix this? Thanks</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>I am not sure but I am using a custom keystore in my weblogic. Is there a way to get the certificate of the external REST service so that I can install it in my keystore?  If so how to do this. Maybe this could fix the problem</p>
