<p>Eclipse link 2.5.2 sometimes misses namespace prefix</p>  <p>I have a class generated from wsdl and it worked fine a long time till I switched to Weblogic 12.1.3 which uses EclipseLink 2.5.2 for marshalling objects. It sometimes misses the namespave prefix on nodes in XML files after marshalling objects to XML which is a problem for other party webservice.  Evrything works fine on EclipseLink 2.5.0 and Jaxb however I don't know whether I can switch to these libraries as WLS 12.1.3 uses 2.5.2 for some reason. Any ideas?</p>
