<p>We are running performance tests on a web app deployed to a WLS cluster, taking periodic JFR recordings. We are analyzing the recordings using JMC.</p>  <p>All recordings show ANTLR classes consuming more than 50% of the CPU (or more, depending on the performance tests load).</p>  <p>Investigating, we found a diagnostic module that had a log parser rule deployed to the entire cluster. Probably left there from a previous troubleshooting session. We have disabled the rule and took recordings again. ANTLR is still there. </p>  <p>Then we stopped the tests, restarted the servers and took recordings again. ANTLR went away.</p>  <p>That may show that the ANTLR classes are used by the diagnostic module indeed, and it takes a server restart the to disable them (documentation says restart not required).</p>  <p>To confirm, we enabled the diagnostic module again, without and then with server restarts. The app is still deployed, but we didn't start the performance tests. ANTLR no longer shows up no matter what we tried.</p>  <p>Looks like it was not used by the Diagnostics Module after all.</p>  <p>The app itself is NOT using ANTLR and does no log parsing.</p>  <p>What component in WLS or in JDK can be using ANTLR? It is causing a considerable load on the servers, skewing our performance tests.</p>
