<p>Can some one help me understand why I'm getting this error while running my managed server locally. My admin server is also running (locally as well) on port 7001.</p>  <p>Why it is trying to connect <strong>172.30.XXX.XXX</strong> ip ? I am but confused what's happening here. When I startup my managed server I get this exception.</p>  <pre><code>   INFO: The Wsee Service is starting     java.net.ConnectException: Tried all: '1' addresses, but could not connect over HTTP to server: '172.30.XXX.XXX', port: '7001'         at weblogic.net.http.HttpClient.openServer(HttpClient.java:401)         at weblogic.net.http.HttpClient.openServer(HttpClient.java:506)         at weblogic.net.http.HttpClient.New(HttpClient.java:313)         at weblogic.net.http.HttpClient.New(HttpClient.java:289)         at weblogic.net.http.HttpURLConnection.connect(HttpURLConnection.java:267)         at weblogic.deploy.service.datatransferhandlers.HttpDataTransferHandler.getDataAsStream(HttpDataTransferHandler.java:76) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
