<p>I have a webapplication on weblogic server with JMS, SPRING, JAVA application.</p>  <p>I have a class that is part of distributed transaction (it performs some operations when it gets JMS message to calculate)</p>  <p>Inside some method of this class I would like to jump out the distributed transaction, so I would block database resource that I update, is it possible?  Can I make a new method with newTx interceptor, would it be able to jump out from the distributet transaction?</p>
