<p>I have a weblogic domain (i.e. server1) that manages multiple managed servers (i.e. server2) on remote machines on which the admin server does not reside.  I am trying to use WLST in online mode to dynamically pack the domain on the Admin Server into a JAR and transfer it to the managed server, but it fails due to CIE ConfigHelper service not being availble.  I've tried to find a reference to this service with no lunck.</p>  <p>Here is the log of the output:</p>  <pre><code>Initializing WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) ...  Welcome to WebLogic Server Administration Scripting Shell  Type help() for help on available commands  Connecting to t3://admin:7001 with userid admin ... Successfully connected to Admin Server "wladmin_server" that belongs to domain "qa".  Warning: An insecure protocol was used to connect to the server. To ensure on-the-wire security, the SSL port or Admin port should be used instead.  Location changed to serverRuntime tree. This is a read-only tree with DomainMBean as the root. For more help, use help('domainConfig')  CIE ConfigHelper online service is not available.  Disconnected from weblogic server: wladmin_server </code></pre>  <p>I'm doing this based on the following link <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/wls/WLSTG/domains.htm#WLSTG406" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/wls/WLSTG/domains.htm#WLSTG406</a> , but it just doesn't seem to work.</p>  <p>I am using Weblogic 12c (12.1.3) running on RH Linux.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
