<p>I am trying to test messages coming in to JMS Queue.Whenever i send a message,messages total column gets updated and Message current remains 0.</p>  <p>When i bring down the Listener and send messages,Message Current column count increases along with Message total while Message Pending remains 0.</p>  <p>Can you please help me understand the below scenarios: 1)When messages are sent,shouldn't message current column show the count? should only messages total count increase?</p>  <p>2)when listener is down,shouldn't the message pending column increase and not messages current?</p>  <p>This seems like a bug to me,Can you please help me? </p>  <p>Also can you please suggest any other positive or negative scenarios that can be tested on JMS Queue? i couldn't post the image of weblogic as i get a  message saying i need atleast 10 reputations to post images.Thanks.</p>
