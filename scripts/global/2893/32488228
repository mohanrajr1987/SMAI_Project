<p>There is a project that uses Weblogic as server runtime environment. I am trying to work in this project in this new computer. I am running a 10.10.5 Yosemite Mac OSX. It seems I installed successfully Weblogic 12.1.3 in this machine however it is needed to download a server adapter in Eclipse to use it, I have instaled it already.</p>  <p>I went to Eclipse, then Preferences -> Server -> Runtime Enviroments -> Add, then I chose Oracle Weblogic Server 12c (12.1.3). In the next screen, it asks for Weblogic Home and Java Home.  How I can find these in Mac OSX?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
