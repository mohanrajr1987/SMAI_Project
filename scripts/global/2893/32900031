<p>I have JDEV 11g IDE, i checking my java version, the result like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J3guc.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J3guc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>When i try to run my weblogic, jdev write in log for my jdev like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XrfXn.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XrfXn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But when i try to run my weblogic, i have an error like :</p>  <pre><code> Error message: JPS-06514: Opening of file based keystore failed. weblogic.security.SecurityInitializationException: The loading of OPSS java security policy provider failed due to exception, see the exception stack trace or the server log file for root cause. If still see no obvious cause, enable the debug flag -Djava.security.debug=jpspolicy to get more information. Error message: JPS-06514: Opening of file based keystore failed. </code></pre>  <p><br> I search on google, and the conclusion of my problem is change the security of <strong>cwallet.sso</strong>. I have changed cwallet.sso permisson file and restart the jdev. like this : <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uf02H.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uf02H.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But i still got an error, the error is still the same. I try to rename and let the jdev create a new cwallet.sso. The cwallet.sso isn't created. How can i fix the adf?. Thanks.</p>
