<p>WebLogic 10.3.6 Java 1.6</p>  <p>So I'm getting an XML problem using Eclipse. Before I went on vacation 7 days ago, this was working fine. I actually reverted to an older version before I left because I got too far ahead with something that isn't very important atm.  I get back today, and I can't get rid of this problem:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The content of element type "result" must match "(module-dependency|package-dependency|token-  dependency)".</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is from a jdk that I have been using on this site for months. In a file that I have never looked at before, let alone changed.  The file is in the jdk at jdk160_29/lib/visualvm/platform/config/ModuleAutoDeps/org-openide-modules.xml. Here is the file:</p>  <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!-- DO NOT ALTER OR REMOVE COPYRIGHT NOTICES OR THIS HEADER.

So would no random errors popping up out of nowhere, but that's Eclipse I guess...</p>
