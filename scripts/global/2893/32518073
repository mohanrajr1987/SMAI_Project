<p>I have a JMS setup as below :</p>  <pre><code>*  1 Admin Server - AdminServer   *  2 Managed servers - managed_server1 , managed_server2   *  2 JMS servers - jms_server1 , jms_server2   *  1 UDQ - UDQ *  1 Connection Factory - UDQ_CF *  1 Cluster ( managed_server1 &amp; managed_server2 ) </code></pre>  <p>Targeting is done as :</p>  <pre><code>jms_server1 and Store1 =&gt; managed_server1   jms_server2 and Store2 =&gt; managed_server2   JMS_Module =&gt; Cluster   SubDeployment_UDQ =&gt; jms_server1, jms_server1   ConnFacty (with "affinity disabled") =&gt; Cluster   UDQ =&gt; SubDeployment_UDQ   </code></pre>  <p>I have an upstream component that will post a JMS message on my UDQ and my wls setup will take care of the load balancing , the problem is - For this component to send message on my UDQ , it has to set the URL as  :  </p>  <pre><code>ipaddress:managed_server1_port ; ipaddress:managed_server2_port </code></pre>  <p>I don't want this kind of targeting because in future if I have to increase the number of managed servers in my environment upstream component will be impacted. Moreover , What if my domain has 100 managed servers ? I cant keep adding all of these details in the URL</p>  <p>Is there a more practical , seamless solution available to this problem ? I explored setting up an httpproxy but that wont help in this setup where no GUI /  http requests are to be handled.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help / inputs in advance<br> Bhavin Bhatia</p>
