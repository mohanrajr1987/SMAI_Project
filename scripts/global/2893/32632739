<p>I'm trying to parse weblogic logfile. I used below command in a batch file in an infinite loop</p>  <pre><code>powershell -command "&amp; {Get-Content "%file_name%" | Select-Object -last 1}" | findstr /m "shut  start" &gt;&gt; !parse_file! </code></pre>  <p>The weblogic has no problem writing into the file but when it restarts, it moves the file as an old file and creates a new file with the same name. This process is prevented by the code I used and hence weblogic can't restart.</p>  <p>Is there anything that can be done to prevent this while I can get my task done</p>
