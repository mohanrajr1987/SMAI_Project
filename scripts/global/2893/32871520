<p>I have a weblogic server with 3 managed servers and an admin server</p>  <p>I am trying to access the bpm composer (which is shown as deployed and active) </p>  <p>I have looked under the Deployments > Bpm Composer > Testing (Tab) which clearly states it is running at </p>  <pre><code>localhost:8103/bpm/composer </code></pre>  <p>However when I attempt to access this I am greeted with a 404.</p>  <p>Annoyingly I am able to access the Console &amp; Enterprise manager, I am thinking the composer might have been hidden or obfuscated somehow as this is our production environment. </p>  <p>Has anyone any idea how to access, or unhide the composer?</p>  <p>Many thanks Alex</p>
