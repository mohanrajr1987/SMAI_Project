<p>I have a problem while deploying my Spring app in welogic 12c.</p>  <p>I use ActiveMQ for JMS and i have this ActiveMQConnectionFactory bean in my xml file jmsContext</p>  <pre><code>&lt;bean id="connectionFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory"&gt;     &lt;property name="brokerURL" value="vm://embedded?broker.persistent=false" /&gt;     &lt;property name="sendTimeout" value="5000" /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; </code></pre>  <p>While deploying, when the app try to create this broker (each 5 seconds) it throws an Exception:</p>  <pre><code>2015-10-01 12:49:08 [[STANDBY] ExecuteThread: '5' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)'] ERROR org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerService - Failed to start Apache ActiveMQ ([embedded, null], javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: org.apache.activemq:type=Broker,brokerName=embedded) </code></pre>  <p>Searching on the web I try something but nothing runs: - There is no more applications running in weblogic server. - If i change the name 'embedded' for other, it throws the same exception. - If i add a parameter to url 'create=false' throws other exception like there is no broker with this name.</p>  <p>In other weblogic with same version in my personal computer it runs good, but i am trying to deploy in other computer and I have this issue.</p>  <p>Thanks for all.</p>  <p>EDIT: I see something about maven dependencies. I import activemq-core in my pom.xml, and in my maven dependencies I have activemq-core and activemq-client, and both dependencies have the same class org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerService (class mencioned in the exception). </p>  <p>Maybe is that the problem? Exception says that the broker already exists and i have two equal classes.</p>  <p>Sorry for my English.</p>
