<p>I hava written a simple servlet which contains only the service methode(the code below). I run a test under weblogic server (version 10.3.6) and I executed a load tests using Gatling. But I was surprised by a great variation of time response with peaks as mentioned in the figure (<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QP2Fz.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/QP2Fz.png</a>): for example, the selected peak mention 99% of threads have a 27 ms as a time response and only 1% of threads have time response equal to 320ms. </p>  <p>Servlet code: </p>  <pre><code>@Override    public void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)                 throws ServletException, IOException         {             String responseMessage = "hello world";             // the message (which is the route)             response.setContentType("text/xml;charset=utf-8");             response.setStatus(200);             response.setContentLength(2);             OutputStream outputStream = response.getOutputStream();             outputStream.write(responseMessage.getBytes());                  } </code></pre>
