<p>Using Facebook's JavaScript SDK I am trying to open a share dialog from <strong>within a canvas app</strong>, which I am able to do fine.  However, when I try to amend the message that gets sent along with it, I'm unable to get things working.</p>  <p>I'm aware I can change the message using meta tags within the document itself, as Facebook scrapes the page on the link to grab <code>og:*</code> tags from the <code>head</code> of the doc, but the message I want to share is specific to this user's experience, for example: "I just scores 9/10 on this quiz, can you do any better?".</p>  <p>I have set up an action, object and story, which are being linked in fine.  Below is my code, which isn't changing the message:</p>  <pre><code>FB.ui({     method: 'share_open_graph',     action_type: 'the-dog-breed-quiz:take',              action_properties: JSON.stringify({         quiz:'https://apps.facebook.com/removed',         message: 'I scored 15 out of a possible 20 on the Test quiz. Can you do any better?'     }) }, function(response){}); </code></pre>
