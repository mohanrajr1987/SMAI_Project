<p>I am using facebook GRAPH API's feed dialogue using URL REDIRECTION to share posts. Though normal posts are getting shared very well , but when the post is a image, I am not able to share it , whenever I try to share the image post , the page to whom the post belongs gets shared instead of the image post.</p>  <p>This is how my url for URL REDIRECTION looks. </p>  <pre><code>   "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?" +    "app_id=" + appid + "&amp;display=popup" +    "&amp;link=" + postLink + "&amp;redirect_uri=" + redirectUrl;  </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to share image posts using URL REDIRECTION, please suggest.</p>
