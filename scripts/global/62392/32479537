<p>I have seen a lot of websites/scripts that retrieves facebook UID from profile url. (lookup-id.com, findmyfbid.com etc). My question is that, if I have multiple profile IDs (url) listed in a notepad file, is it possible to get UIDs of all the url by running a loop with a program or a Script?</p>  <p>I have searched this and few other websites but did not get a relevant information or a code that can be manipulated a bit to fulfill my requirement.</p>  <p>Appreciate some help here.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
