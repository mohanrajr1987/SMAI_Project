<p>I have Account model with User base. Account model hasMany userIdentify and userIdentify belongsTo Account. When user login with Facebook account, all fb data are stored into userIdentify model. Now, all I want to do is to create Account object that is linked to userIdentify (want to copy all data to Account model), but I can't do it since I don't have any password (it is required field).</p>  <p>Is there any way to copy all the data to my Account model? And do I need to create Account when I already have userIdentify?</p>
