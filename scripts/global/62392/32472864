<p>In the Graph Api Explorer i did not find any permission like <code>user_groups</code>. I select all the "User Data Permissions" and "Extended Permissions" but it did not worked.</p>  <p>In graph api explorer I am using this command <code>GET-&gt;/v2.4/me/groups</code>. and i get empty JSON data Like this.<br> </p>  <pre><code>{   "data":[   ] } </code></pre>  <p>And if I use the old graph api version 2.2 Like <code>GET-&gt;/v2.2/me/groups</code> then I get the groups only in which I am admin not all the groups.</p>  <p>If anyone have this experience and also have any solution please help me to solve my problem.</p>  <p>Thanks<br> Asim</p>
