<p>When I attempt to post something to Facebook through the SDK I cant seem to change the privacy settings, specifically who sees the post and who doesn't. Essentially it keeps posting to facebook but only I am allowed to see it. I want to change it so that everyone i am friends with can see it.</p>  <pre><code>        this.postFacebook = function(){           var privacy = {             'value': 'CUSTOM',             'friends': 'EVERYONE'           };               FB.api('/me/feed', 'post', { name: 'asdf', link: 'www.google.com', caption:'tester', description: 'description', privacy: privacy});         } </code></pre>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
