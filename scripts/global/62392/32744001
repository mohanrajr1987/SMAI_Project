<p>I'm building a MEAN app and I'm trying to get some data about a FB page with following Graph API request:</p>  <p><a href="https://graph.facebook.com/153572758009832?fields=name,description,picture.type(large),location,phone,emails&amp;access_token=MyAppId|MyAppSecret" rel="nofollow">https://graph.facebook.com/153572758009832?fields=name,description,picture.type(large),location,phone,emails&amp;access_token=MyAppId|MyAppSecret</a></p>  <p>This works correctly on localhost, but fails on live server with the following response:</p>  <pre><code>{"error":     {"message":         "Unsupported get request. Please read the Graph API documentation at https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/docs\/graph-api","type":"GraphMethodException","code":100,"fbtrace_id":"GqwXhNwvjIJ"     } } </code></pre>  <p>I've also tried to obtain the access_token for my app, and use it instead of app id|secret pair, and also to use <a href="https://github.com/Thuzi/facebook-node-sdk" rel="nofollow">the following FB SDK for node</a>, but with the same result. I've thought maybe FB has some server IP address restrictions for apps, but could find nothing.</p>
