<p>I am making a <strong>fb.api()</strong> request to the Facebook api but am unable to get the email address of the user.</p>  <pre><code>FB.api('/me?fields=name,email,id', function(response) {   console.log(response);   }); </code></pre>  <p>When I make this api request an object is returned by Facebook which only has the <code>id</code> AND <code>name</code> of the user but does not give me the email address of the user</p>  <p>I have asked for email permission and the user has granted it</p>  <p>Please correct me where I am going wrong.</p>
