<p>I am trying to share image from FB app, using send dialog like I am doing for past few years.</p>  <pre><code>var obj = {   method: 'feed',   link: 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/TESTPAGE?sk=app_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;app_data=share|10',   caption: '',   name: 'Title for share',   description: 'description fort share',   picture: IMG_URL }; </code></pre>  <p>I have provide 2 screenshots  when I click on share button inside of app <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MTlus.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MTlus.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>what I keep getting on my profile wall.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyKNR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyKNR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Until few months ago, FB would show data from feed method, but now, feed is acting just like share method: it shares url, without image and labels I sent through feed dialog. </p>  <p>All I want is to share image from app, and url of that image should point to app url.  Any suggestions?</p>
