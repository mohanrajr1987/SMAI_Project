<p>On a mobile app, I want to have a Share button that posts an image on behalf of the user, but instead of posting it on this user's timeline, it must be posted on a specific Facebook Page timeline.</p>  <p>By using the Share dialog, it seems there is no way to configure the target of the post (in this case, the Facebook Page). Or at least I couldn't find it.</p>  <p>How would you do it?</p>  <p>Note: the app is made in Unity/C#, although I don't think this would matter much</p>
