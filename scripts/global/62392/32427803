<p>I am confused if <code>user_status</code> permission is useful by any mean. I tried <code>user_posts</code> and that works fine but <code>user_status</code> do not work.  I do not know if I am missing something. I have tried it on Graph API Explorer.</p>  <p><strong>What I want to know?</strong></p>  <p>How to use just <code>user_status</code> permission? As per Facebook references user_status</p>  <p><code>Provides access to a person's statuses. These are posts on Facebook which don't include links, videos or photos.</code></p>  <p><strong>What I know already?</strong></p>  <p>By getting user_posts permission I successfully got status updates and other posts by fetching node data for <code>/me/feed</code> . </p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>By saying <code>user_status</code> do not work, I mean that when I use <code>/me/feed</code> I should get status of mine(not other type of posts), but I do not get anything.</p>
