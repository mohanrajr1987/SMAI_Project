<p>I have build an app </p>  <p>here is the url : compaddicts.org/website/pubblisocial </p>  <p>Its approved today by facebook for all permissions i asked for , but the problem comes when someone who's locale is not english , the app does not works for it , i tried to submit the app in italian language , but the problem is if i ask for multiple languages then should i create a sub domain for second language ??</p>  <p>And if yes then its going to change the basic url for the app which is not a correct way , but i have seen many apps working in multi languages , where they provide a switcher to choose the language and one you choose the language they transfer you to the sub domain where they convert the details into the language you have choosen.</p>  <p>How should i do it for my app ?</p>  <p>Please do not ask to go to facebook and learn doc i have done it more than 20 times , and i have already submitted it to the facebook , but i am confused since an app can only have one base url so how can we run an app on sub domain , please make a reply ?</p>
