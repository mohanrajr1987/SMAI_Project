<p>I have a web application, that runs in Facebook as iFrame. It worked perfect for long time, and still working in my PC, but now in iPad, they make the facebook canvas smaller and somehow my app is NOT fit the new Facebook canvas size. How I can make the app fit the size of Facebook canvas size?</p>  <p>I see in the app setting:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Canvas Fixed Width "Yes" sets canvas width to 760 px"   But this is for sure FB bug, because FB iPad canvas width is much smaller than 760px in their last iPad app.   Also there is no way to define custom width .</p> </blockquote>
