<p>I have the following facebook javascript API sharing code and I'm trying to make it dynamic so I can create a series of buttons for posting quiz results to facebook.  Here is my javascript:</p>  <pre><code>function fb_share() { // facebook share dialog FB.ui( {     method: 'feed',     link: "https://www.webniraj.com/link-to-page/",     picture: "https://stackexchange.com/users/flair/557969.png",     caption: "Some description here" }, function( response ) {     // do nothing } ); } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to call the function and pass custom variables but I'm unsure how to push my custom variables into the FB.ui array.</p>  <p>I have made several attempts and failed.  So far I have something like this:</p>  <pre><code>function fb_share(url,img,description) { // facebook share dialog FB.ui( {     method: 'feed',     link: url,     picture: img,     caption: description }, function( response ) {     // do nothing } ); } </code></pre>  <p>but this isn't working.. how do I pass variables into the second FB.ui array so that I can generate text, picture and link dynamically with my function call?</p>
