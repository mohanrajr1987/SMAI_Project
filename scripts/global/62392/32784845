<p>I'm trying to display embedded Facebook posts in my iOS app. Due to our architecture I want to display the post in a WebView.  I'm using the default embed code generated. The only thing I change is </p>  <pre><code>js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/de_DE/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3"; </code></pre>  <p>to</p>  <pre><code>js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/de_DE/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3"; </code></pre>  <p>Because in the app // points to applewebdata and this is obviously not going to work.</p>  <p>Testing with both the app and a local html file I noticed that the whole embed code needs to be on a real online webserver to be working correctly.</p>  <p>Is there any way around that? Any way I can use the embed code locally?</p>
