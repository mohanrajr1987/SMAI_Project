<p>I'm creating a wordpress plugin which lets the user to connect his/her facebook account, and in my Facebook App settings, I have specified the Redirect Uri, but when the plugin is installed on other domains, I get an error that "Given URL is not allowed by the Application configuration....and etc.".  Now, I want everytime if there's a new user who install the plugin, I want to get his/her domain name and add it programmatically to my Facebook App's Valid OAuth Redirect Uri's. Is this possible? </p>  <p>Help me please... Thanks.</p>
