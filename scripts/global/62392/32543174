<p>I'm facing following issues while fetching facebook user/pages/group timeline posts:</p>  <ol> <li>I'm not getting all information (photos urls, link, created_time, etc) in posts objects retrieved using <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.4/group/feed#read" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Following is a sample response of this api:</li> </ol>  <blockquote> <pre><code>[     {         "message": "this is going to be real fun https://localhost.com/N1AyEvZp",         "story": "Rajveer Singh added photos to XYZ Photos in My-group.",         "updated_time": "2015-09-03T16:27:34+0000",         "id": "405944472923733_413853035466210"     },     {         "message": "this is going to be fun https://localhost.com/EJo1WvZp",         "story": "Rajveer Singh added photos to XYZ Photos in My-group.",         "updated_time": "2015-09-03T16:14:41+0000",         "id": "405944472923733_413848848799962"     },     {         "message": "this is going to be some real funhttps://localhost.com/VyVKdWga",         "story": "Rajveer Singh added photos to XYZ Photos in My-group.",         "updated_time": "2015-09-02T15:45:08+0000",         "id": "405944472923733_413582785493235"     } ] </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>This response is missing the photo urls, links, captions, etc from the posts. Is there any different api for fetching those informations ? Also, if I directly hit the one of the post object <strong>/405944472923733_413582785493235</strong> then I get following response:</p>  <blockquote> <pre><code>{   "created_time": "2015-09-02T15:45:07+0000",   "message": "this is going to be some real funhttps://localhost.com/VyVKdWga",   "story": "Rajveer Singh added photos to XYZ Photos in My-group.",   "id": "405944472923733_413582785493235" } </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>Though I get <em>created_time</em> in this response but <em>pictures, urls,</em> are still missing. I found <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.4/post" rel="nofollow">this</a> api deprecated. <strong>Is there any different api which can give me all the info ?</strong></p>  <ol start="2"> <li>The above response is also missing comments and replies. On google search I found that we can get comments using <strong>/405944472923733_413582785493235/comments</strong> api but again that api doesn't mention the <em>exact comments count</em>. <em>Also, the api doesn't give all the comments in a single api call</em>. They have a pagination kind of thing. <strong>Can anyone tell me how can I get exact count of comments, replies to comments, and retrieve all the comments in a single api call</strong>. If we can't retrieve all the comments in a single go, then <strong>how can we use pagination</strong> ? I need to send all the comments related to a post to my front-end. with pagination, how can I achieve that ? <strong>Do I need to store the previous/next urls somewhere in front-end ?</strong> Following is a sample response of this:</li> </ol>  <blockquote> <pre><code>{     "data": [         {             "id": "[post_id]",             "from": {                 "name": "[name]",                 "id": "[id]"              },              "message": "[message]",              "created_time": "2011-01-23T02:36:23+0000"         },         {              "id": "[id]",              "from": {              "name": "[name]",                  "id": "[id]"              },             "message": "[message]",             "created_time": "2011-01-23T05:16:56+0000"         }     ],   "paging": {     "cursors": {       "after": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOREUzTVRJeE5qWTRORGN5Tmpnd09qRTBOREl3T0RRd09URT0=",       "before": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOREUzTVRFNU16RTRORGN5T1RFMU9qRTBOREl3T0RRd05qZz0="     },     "previous": "previousUrl",     "next": "nextUrl" } </code></pre> </blockquote>  <ol start="3"> <li>How to get <em>count of all the likes and shares</em> of a post ? I simply want the count and doesn't want who actually likes/shared the post. How can I get that ? I found that using <strong>/likes</strong> gives a list of all those who liked the post but it doesn't give the count. Following is a sampple response of that:</li> </ol>  <blockquote> <pre><code>{   "data": [     {       "id": "824565440992306"     }   ],   "paging": {     "cursors": {       "after": "ODI0NTY1NDQwOTkyMzA2",       "before": "ODI0NTY1NDQwOTkyMzA2"     }   } } </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p><em>General Information:</em></p>  <ul> <li>I'm using Node.js Javascript SDK for hitting FB APIs. </li> <li>I'm using correct access token, so that's not an issue for sure.</li> <li>I have gone through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15619742/how-to-get-public-wall-posts-with-the-facebook-api">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4791951/retrieve-facebook-post-comments-using-graph-api">this</a> but didn't get any help from them.</li> </ul>  <p>I need all the information related to wall posts on my back-end so that I can send all data to my front-end for proper rendering.
