<p>The app I'm building is going to have multiple parts over various subdomains, i.e. front-end "domain.ca", and api would be "api.domain.ca".  In the facebook app settings we set the domain as "domain.ca", and the website url as "<a href="http://domain.ca" rel="nofollow">http://domain.ca</a>", it says it would allow all subdomains access as well.</p>  <p>When I try to use the auth on "api.domain.ca", I get "Given URL is not allowed by the Application configuration: One or more of the given URLs is not allowed by the App's settings. It must match the Website URL or Canvas URL, or the domain must be a subdomain of one of the App's domains."</p>  <p>How can I make this work?  We want the user to be able to use the login on the front side, and pass the access_token to the api side to check if the user exists, or create a new user and attach the social login.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
