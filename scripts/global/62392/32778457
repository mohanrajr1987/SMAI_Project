<p>I have a Phone Gap Android app which uses Facebook JS SDK to create Facebook share dialog. I tested on 3 devices. It works perfectly fine on one device, but the other two produce no results. When I press the share button, it does nothing. </p>  <p>I was able to determine the FB.getLoginStatus returns "unknown" on the devices that fail to work. However, I am logged into FB via login dialog inside the app. The working device correctly returns "connected".</p>  <p>Also, Like and Comment features work fine on all devices.</p>  <p>Devices work fine</p>  <p>Nexus 7 - 5.1.1 (fb user is admin of the FB app)</p>  <p>Devices share dialog:</p>  <p>Galaxy Trend - 4.0.4 (fb user is admin or developer of the FB app)</p>  <p>Lenovo Tablet - 4.1.2 (fb user has no association with the FB app)</p>  <p>The FB app is not in sandbox, it is live.</p>  <p>Here is my share function. </p>  <pre><code>function sharepost(link,picture,name,description,post_type,page_name){              var description_unes = unescape(description);             FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {                  if (response.status == 'connected') {                      var obj = {                         method: 'feed',                         link: link,                          picture: "http://example.com/fb.php?u=hsttps://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDQXWajSt1TJxUz&amp;url="+picture, //full_picture                         name: name,                           description: description_unes                     };                     FB.ui(                         obj,                         function(response) {                             if (response &amp;&amp; !response.error_code) {                               alert('Posting completed.');                             } else {                               alert('Error while posting.');                             }                         }                     );                 }             });         } </code></pre>  <p>Anybody ran into similar issue where the behavior differs based on a mobile device (or I guess the android SDK version?).  thanks much</p>  <p>UPDATE: I read here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15226244/fb-getloginstatus-return-unknown-in-firefox-when-user-is-logged">FB.getLoginStatus() return &quot;unknown&quot; in Firefox when user is logged</a> that in a browser it is related to 3rd party cookies, but how can this be when this is an Android App. When I get authenticated into the app, the status is "connected", but then when I share, the status becomes "unknown".</p>
