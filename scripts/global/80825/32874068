<p>I have a solution in Visual Studio 2012 containing projects of different types but web projects show a little blue warning icon in the Solution Explorer. There's no any warning messages in the List of Errors. Building process doesn't show any error. I have been trying to find any reference issue, any missing file or library but everything seems to be right. What does the blue warning icon means?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tAB78.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tAB78.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
