<p>I have been trying to deploy some small android apps on my vs2012 to Nexus 5(kitkat) emulator (Xamarin Android Player). And also the "hello world" first android application even with out editing anything. But it can't work for me. VS2012 says the Deploy is succeeded but when I try to open it on the emulator, it says " Unfortunately, Helloworld has stopped.". I have searched a lot to see any problem on it and  solutions on Stack Overflow . But I haven't found helpful it for me  yet. I am a beginner for such development. Please help me why is it like this.</p>
