<p>I am trying to make CodeRush 15.1.4.0 (trial) work on both VS2012 and VS2013 on the same machine. It runs fine on VS2012 but on VS2013 only IntelliSense is working - the rest of the tools are gone.</p>  <p>On another machine with only VS2013 installed, CodeRush is working perfectly.</p>  <p>Does anybody else have this issue, or can help?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
