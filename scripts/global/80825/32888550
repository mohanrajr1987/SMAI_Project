<p>I am new to using windows form C# in visual basic 12 . In a ASP.NET form, you can right click on a linkbutton or imagelink, click preferences, and enter in a form under postbackurl to go to the that form after clicking the link/image. How is this done using a linklabel in a windows form? I cannot seem to figure this out. </p>
