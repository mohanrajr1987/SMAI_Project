<p>I am running Visual Studio 2013 Pro on a Windows 7 machine. I am running two monitors at 1920x1200</p>  <p>When I scroll the scroll bar in Visual Studio the code "sticks" on the screen even though I see the bar moving. Sometimes if I touch the bar itself it will either wholly or partially correct. Sometimes this leads to pieces of code strewn across the screen. However when I tried taking a screen shot it came out perfect. </p>  <p>I tried checking and unchecking "Automatically adjust visual experience based on client performance" as suggested in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19617670/why-vs-2013-is-very-slow">Why VS 2013 is very slow</a>, I have also closed Visual Studio and tried to clear up system processes. </p>
