<p>I use Visual Studio 2012 Premium (Version 11.0.61219.00 Update 5). There is a C++ solution with some projects. Everything can be built without errors. Then I import a new (but already existing) project into this solution (via right-click -> <code>Add</code> -> <code>Existing Project...</code>). If I now try to build this project or any other of the previous projects, an error message appears: <code>"Cannot perform requested action because a build is already in project"</code> (which is not true, there is no build running).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0s7d1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0s7d1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I try to rebuild the complete solution, another message is shown: <code>"The operation could not be completed. Wrong parameter."</code></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8pQaV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8pQaV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>At the same time, there are no errors or warnings in the output view at all. Rather a build summary is given, which looks OK.</p>  <pre><code>Build Summary -------------  Total build time: 00:12.379  ========== Rebuild All: 0 succeeded or up-to-date, 0 failed, 12 skipped, Completed at 30.09.2015 17:15:58 ========== </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/w4rtd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/w4rtd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What could be wrong here? The project seems to be intact, I can open and view the properties, nothing suspicious. In fact, I imported the other 11 projects in the same way and from the same origin. Where can I get some Visual Studio log files or turn on any extended diagnostics which could point me to the right direction? Help me, I'm stuck!</p>
