<p>Currently trying to enable migrations for my database using an MVC application and I'm getting the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell,   Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or   one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now, there is solutions for this on SO, but it is relating to the Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Shell (Isolated) Redistributable Package, which when I go to the Microsoft web page <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=30670" rel="nofollow">here</a> to download it gives me a 404 error on the web page. </p>  <p>Is there any other way I can get around this issue? I've tried a few things with the global.asax file and the configuration file for Visual Studio itself, but have had no luck. I'm just trying to learn MVC and this is hindering that greatly.</p>  <p>Thanks in advanced for any help.</p>
