<p>For all Visual Studio ASP.Net MVC developers - I'm sure you've faced this problem before:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/McGHr.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/McGHr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>In each one of my controllers, there is usually an Index, Create, Edit and Detail views. All of the default view files generated by ASP.Net's scaffolding are all given the same name, for example: <code>index.cshtml</code>. Granted, they're in different folders.</p>  <p>So it's really easy to get lost in Visual Studio when you have four or five tabs open, all with the same name! Is there a way/plugin to get visual studio show me something more meaningful, such as the controller name/view folder? Or do you developers just rename all of your files once they're generated? I already have resharper so bonus points if it's possible with that.</p>
