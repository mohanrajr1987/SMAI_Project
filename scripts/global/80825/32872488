<p>I need to change the column delimiter character of the .csv exported file of the Concurrency Visualizer Thread View. I'm using C#, in Visual Studio 2012, on Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>  <p>The problem is that the CSV file uses the comma <code>,</code> character, to separate the columns, and also in the numbers. This brings confusion to the statistics software, including Microsoft Excel. With this symbol you cannot tell if <code>2000,22</code> is a float number or two columns (the first with the <code>2000</code> value, and the second with the <code>22</code> value). I tried to open these files with Microsoft Excel and SPSS v19, using comma (,) or space as columns delimiter, but I do not get the same table exported from the Concurrency Visualizer.</p>  <p>I'm doing an investigation that requires measuring code block in milliseconds, that is why I'm using the span of the Concurrency Visualizer. I need to statistically process the duration of all the spans, to be sure my code is getting the right results. That is why I am using the CSV export feature, in the Concurrency Visualizer Thread View.</p>  <p>The semicolon character <code>;</code> could be a nice column delimiter, because it eliminates the ambiguity. </p>  <p>The CSV file exported by the Concurrency Visualizer Thread View can be a great tool for software investigation, once we solve this.</p>
