<p>I am creating dynamic columns in Crystal report. Columns are showing and hiding successfully but i am  unable to show/hide the corresponding table grid lines. I drew lines to make a table grid but problem is that lines are not hiding when columns are hidden.</p>  <p>The design (layout) of my report is as below</p>  <pre><code>Name    Age  Gender    Adress   description   abc   20    m        ab   xyz   30    f            s     40    m             </code></pre>  <p>1)I created a table grid through lines but problem is when one or two columns are hidden, blank lines are show in grid which means lines are not hiding and looks ugly.</p>  <p>2)I created a table using the text objects borders setting but the problem here is when a column is full empty or partially empty or some cell on a row is empty for eg. description then text object border will not show in detail section.</p>  <p>Can someone please guide with this.</p>
