<p>I am attempting to install Visual Studio 2015 Community but during the installation there is a prompt on the install wizard saying either saying:</p>  <p>'Microsoft build tools x86' (I would assume it's trying to build something and it will not let  me) </p>  <p>OR</p>  <p>'Creating a system restore point' (View screenshot):  <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/2da949c61d65bcf1b5c2b66dc3bfdf29.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.gyazo.com/2da949c61d65bcf1b5c2b66dc3bfdf29.png</a></p>  <p>I am running Windows 10 and I do not know what to do! Even if I cancel the installation it won't let me and I have to force close it using the task manager. Furthermore it has taken up nearly 5GB on my HDD and I can't even uninstall it as it is showing the same message ('Creating a system restore point')!</p>  <p>Any suggestions on how to go about uninstalling it and installing Visual Studio the correct way? I desperately need it for my coursework.</p>  <p>Thanks, James.</p>
