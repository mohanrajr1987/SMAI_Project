<p>Visual Studio 2012, C++ project.</p>  <p>My project has a dependency to external library (includes its headers). Library is large and should not be stored in source-controlled repository itself. Each developer may keep the library sources in different locations (Dev1 will keep it on C:\libs, Dev2 somewhere else).</p>  <p>Is there a way to keep the dependency in the project, but yet to avoid committing VC++ Project file with my own path to remote repository? I was thinking about adding to "Include" directories environment variable that each developer would have to set properly on their machines, but maybe there are some better solutions?</p>
