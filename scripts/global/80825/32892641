<p>I am trying to figure out the functions for an application that you order donuts and coffee through.  There is no box to input quantities.  The type of doughnuts are selected using radio buttons grouped in combo boxes as is the type of coffee. The user ordering does not input any information.  That application calculates according to the selected radio buttons.  There is also a 3% sales tax.</p>  <p>The donuts are as follows: Glazed are $0.65, Sugar $0.65, Chocolate are $0.85, and Filled are $1.00.</p>  <p>The coffee costs: Regular is $1.00 and cappuccino is $2.50.</p>  <p>How do I write a function for each one?  I would think I would just write one function that calculates the donut, coffee and sales tax.  I am not sure what I am supposed to include if there is only one possible choice for each case.  I thought that I could just write a bunch of constants since nothing changed and do an If statement but the assignment is asking for functions.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far for the doughnuts.</p>  <pre><code>Private Function GetDonutPrice(ByVal strDonut As String) As Double      Dim dblDonutPrice As Double      'Calculates and returns the price of donuts       If strDonut = "G" Or strDonut = "S" Then         dblDonutPrice = 0.65       ElseIf strDonut = "C" Then         dblDonutPrice = 0.85      Else         strDonut = "F"         dblDonutPrice = 1.0       End If       Return dblDonutPrice   End Function </code></pre>  <p>And then for the btnCalc_Click I coded this:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub btnCalc_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)       'Displays donut and cappucino subtotal, taxes and price       Dim strDonutPrice As String      Dim dblDonutPrice As Double      If radGlazed.Checked Then         strDonutPrice = "G"       ElseIf radSugar.Checked Then         strDonutPrice = "S"       ElseIf radChoc.Checked Then         strDonutPrice = "C"      ElseIf radFilled.Checked strDonutPrice = "F"      End If     ' get the donut price '      dblDonutPrice = GetDonutPrice(strDonutPrice)   End Sub    And I get an error in dblDonutPrice = GetDonutPrice(strDonutPrice)  </code></pre>
