<p>I am trying to figure out the total amount on my ssrs report.. However, it is not populating any total number for me. I can see the column fine but it doesn't give me total value on the bottom of my table. I have checked the text box and properties and checked visibility. It says show boxes. I couldn't find any specific reason why its not showing the total value. Does anyone know, how can I make it visible? Is it something with my query? I added total by right click on the box and clicking add total. </p>
