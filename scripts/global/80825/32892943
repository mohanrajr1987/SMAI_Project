<p>I already have a copy of visual studio 2012 installed on my computer. When I try to download the Windows Phone 8 SDK, the file requires me to download the whole visual studio software again. Is it necessary? Can the windows phone SDK be installed as a plugin to the existing visual studio 2012 which I have in my computer?</p>
