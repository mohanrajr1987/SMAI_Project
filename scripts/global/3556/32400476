<p>I need to click from main report to sub-report which should be opened in the new window. I have three row groups:</p>  <pre><code>(Country - Destination - Hotel)  </code></pre>  <p>and information about number of reservations </p>  <pre><code>(Quantity)  </code></pre>  <p>and people </p>  <pre><code>(PAX)  </code></pre>  <p>in those specific <code>Countries - Destinations - Hotels</code>. What I need is when I click on the value <code>(Quantity, PAX)</code> on highest level (Group "Country"), it will open sub-report with all hotels on that level.</p>  <p>For example when I'll click on "PAX" value when data are summarized by EGYPT, it will open report with all hotels under specific Country => values from table. For now it's filling only one value into parameter in sub-report. </p>
