<p>In SilverStripe, one can fetch a bunch of records, like so:</p>  <pre><code>$entryRecords = Entry::get()-&gt;sort('Email'); </code></pre>  <p>If I want to find out how many Entry records I have, I can call the count method on the DataList, like this:</p>  <pre><code>$totalEntryRecords = $entryRecords-&gt;count(); </code></pre>  <p>If I want to find out how many unique Email addresses are in those records using the SilverStripe ORM in PHP from the DataList without writing a loop and without resorting to running new custom DB query, how would I do that?</p>  <p>Hereâ€™s what I've tried so far and it does not work:</p>  <pre><code>GroupedList::create($entryRecords)-&gt;groupBy('Email')-&gt;Count(); // does not work </code></pre>  <p>I get the following fatal error: PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function Count() on a non-object</p>  <p>The GroupedList API shows that there is a Count method.  So not sure why that wouldn't work.</p>
