<p>Is it possible to change a name of a field in .net assembly? I use that assembly in some case insensitive scripting environment which complains that this public field is not CLS compliant. In the same class there is a property with the same name, just the first letter of field and property differs in case. Unfortunately, i don't have sources. Ideally, i would mark it private or add _ in field's name. I wonder if there is a tool that allow such thing as renaming metadata of the class. I thought about using redgate reflector to extract code and modify and compile back into assembly. But that just doesn't work for me.</p>
