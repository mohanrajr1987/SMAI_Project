<p>Is there any way, using reflection, to determine whether a static final field has an '=' value (so that the value will be in-lined when it is accessed) or whether its value is assigned by the static initializer? If the field does have a value, is there any way to retrieve that value without using the Field.get method (and therefore causing the static initializer to be executed)?</p>
