<p>Trying to implement an unlimited value date field in a custom module form. I've been trying to follow the examples in a <a href="http://rapiddg.com/blog/use-ajax-support-multiple-item-values-custom-drupal-7-forms" rel="nofollow">blog post on unlimited item values in forms</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/752056" rel="nofollow">Drupal documentation on ajax forms</a>.</p>  <p>I've tried adding the equivalent of the <code>custom_registration_form</code> function code from the blog post above to my form builder function and ajax callback, but can't get additional date fields to show up when my ajax-enabled button is clicked. The <code>$form_state['storage']</code> data is available after clicking the save button for the form as a whole, but I can't tell if it's being used in the ajax callback properly.</p>  <p>Any ideas on implementing an unlimited value field in a module or links to examples would be appreciated. Unlimited fields seem like such basic functionality to Drupal's Field API, but I can't find any good examples of implementing this in custom code.</p>
