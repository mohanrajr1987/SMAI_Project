<p>I am using <code>image.plot</code> from the <code>fields</code> package to plot maps. The maps all have different dimensions/numbers of pixels and I would like to plot each on the same scale, i.e. that the second plot in the example below is twice the size of the first</p>  <pre><code>a &lt;- matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)   b &lt;- matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10) image.plot(seq(1, 10), seq(1, 10), a, asp =1) image.plot(seq(1, 20), seq(1, 10), b, asp =1) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks</p>
