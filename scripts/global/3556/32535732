<p>I am newbie in Elastic search. I am trying to implement it in Python for one of my college projects. I want to use Elastic search as a resume indexer. Everything is working fine except it is showing all the fields in <code>_source field</code> .I don't want some fields and I tried too many thing but nothing is working. Below is my code    </p>  <pre><code>es = Elastcisearch()   query = { "_source":{     "exclude":["resume_content"]             },         "query":{             "match":{                 "resume_content":{                     "query":keyword,                     "fuzziness":"Auto",                     "operator":"and",                     "store":"false"                         }                     }                 }             }      res = es.search(size=es_conf["MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS_LIMIT"],index=es_conf["ELASTIC_INDEX_NAME"], body=query) </code></pre>  <p>return res</p>  <p>where <code>es_conf</code> is my local dictionary. </p>  <p>Apart from the above code I have also tried <code>_source:false</code> ,<code>_source:[name of my fields]</code>, <code>fields:[name of my fields]</code> . I also tried <code>store=False</code> in my search method. Any ideas? </p>
