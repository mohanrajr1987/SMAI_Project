<p>Jquery Validation in IE9 is setting all the text fields as Required. Can't find why? In my form I have more fields Not Required. But when I click Submit, the class error is added to ALL the text fields included the Not Required.</p>  <p>Here are my rules:</p>  <p>$(document).ready(function() {</p>  <pre><code>setFields();  var validator = $("#frmContact").validate({         rules: {             ddQuestions:"required",             txtEmail: {                 required: true,                 email: true             },             txtName:{required: true, placeholder: true},             txtPhone:'customphone',             txtAddress: "required",             txtCity:"required",             ddStates:"required",             txtMessage:"required",             txtZipcode:{required:true,zipcodeUS:true},         },         messages: {             captcha: "Correct captcha is required. Click the captcha to generate a new one",             ddQuestions: "Please select a topic",             txtName:{required:"Do not forget put your name", placeholder: "Do not forget put your name"},             txtEmail:"Insert a valid email to be in contact",             txtAddress:"Don't forget put your address",             txtCity:"Please insert the city",             ddStates:"Please select the state",             txtMessage:"Don't forget put your message",             txtZipcode:"Insert a valid zipcode",         },         ignore:":not(:visible)" }); </code></pre>
