<p>Continuing in my project here is where I’ve gotten stuck. The following code is intended to help me manually fill in, missing information for 3 fields for each of the lines in a given file. Each of the 3 fields has a title.</p>  <pre><code> while read -r line &lt;&amp;3  do    echo "$line" &gt;&amp;4    echo "$line"    echo "Histórico: "    read -r Historico    echo "$Historico" &gt;&amp;4    echo "Conta: "    read -r Conta2    echo "$Conta2" &gt;&amp;4    echo "Valor: "    read -r Valor    echo "$Valor" &gt;&amp;4  done 3&lt;resultado.txt 4&gt;resultado2.txt </code></pre>  <p>Thus, it reads the file (resultado.txt), prints the first line of the file in the terminal screen and right bellow it prints the first title, so i can manually insert information bellow this title. When i finish typing, and hit enter, it jumps to the next title. Example:</p>  <pre><code>This is line 1 Title 1: This is the missing information for title 1 from line 1 Title 2: This is the missing information for title 2 from line 1 Title 3: This is the missing information for title 3 from line 1 </code></pre>  <p>Information for title 3 is a value, a number. I need the script to read title 3 and if it is smaller than the number in field 7 (from line 1), then repeat these steps until the sum of the numbers typed for title 3 are equal to the number in field 7 (from line 1).</p>  <p>This should repeat for all lines in the file.</p>  <p>I could not find helpful information, but am grateful if someone could point me a direction where to find information to accomplish this. I thought, perhaps, to pipe an awk statement, as bellow, somewhere in this command?</p>  <pre><code> awk -F"|" '{ sum += $1 } END { print sum }' </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
