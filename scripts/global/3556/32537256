<p>i am using these drupal modules</p>  <pre><code>search_api  search_api_solr date_range_formatter  views  </code></pre>  <p>and in fact many other modules to get my Solr / Drupal project going to index ~100000 nodes of content.</p>  <p>The setup is working great, BUT i need to get search results from the Solr for a date range field and this is where i am stuck.</p>  <p>Somehow i am stuck with setting up the correct operator "between" and "not between" and using "&lt;=" or ">=" is causing trouble here.</p>  <p>I can't get my Solr-query like</p>  <pre><code>field[1 TO *] AND field[* TO 10] </code></pre>  <p>to work.</p>  <p>One content type can have multiple date ranges when available for searching.</p>  <p>The user <strong>can search for a start date and an end date</strong>. The daterange should match inside each individual daterange of the indexed entity type.</p>  <p>Let's say it is valid from:</p>  <pre><code>2015-10-01 to 2015-10-10 2015-11-01 to 2015-11-10 ... </code></pre>  <p>and so on.</p>  <p>To get me going and sort the problems the right way i need to know first:</p>  <p>What is the best practise to store a date range inside Drupal to index at the Solr side? Is a date range a good way or would is better to store a range with a value for each day individually like:</p>  <pre><code>2015-10-01 2015-10-02 2015-10-03 ... </code></pre>  <p>What is the best for Solr to index a date range?</p>  <p>What field type inside Drupal would you suggest to store the values inside an entity type to be able to send it to Drupal?</p>  <p>I know i am not the first struggeling with this. Details can be found here:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1783746" rel="nofollow">https://www.drupal.org/node/1783746</a></p>  <p>but onfortunately none of these patches were error free to my setup. I tried all out to get this going. Now i am looking for any advice, sum ups or thoughts that might be helpful to track down my last bits of errors.</p>  <p>Any advice or idea is really appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
