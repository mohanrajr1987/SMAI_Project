<p>all! So I'm brand-spankin' new to SilverStripe, and while I've had success in modifying the 'Gallery' module to include an option to set the thumbnail size, I'm having issues using the thumbnail width/height values in my template. The code below does not show any of the gallery images (if I hardcode a width and height, such as 250,250 they display)-- but after the loop where I display the $ThumbWidth and $ThumbHeight values, those are displaying just fine...so I know those values are available to the template.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;% loop OrderedImages %&gt;         &lt;a class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="gallery" href="$Filename" title="$Caption"&gt;                 $SetSize($ThumbWidth, $ThumbHeight)         &lt;/a&gt; &lt;% end_loop %&gt; Width: $ThumbWidth&amp;nbsp; Height: $ThumbHeight </code></pre>  <p>So apparently, the $SetSize function is not liking the values I'm passing to it. Can someone shed some light on where my mistake is?</p>  <p>Thanks! Bryan</p>
