<p>I want to be able to see the bug status reflected in the Reports that I generate in Testlink. Currently it shows all the bugs as Open and the Resolved status does not get reflected.  So I was hoping that I could map the Status field in Jira to a custom field in Testlink so that I could populate that field in a report. Is this even possible? How should I go about it? I am a novice so more details will help.</p>
