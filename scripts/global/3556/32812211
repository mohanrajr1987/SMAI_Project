<p>I’ve been working on this for a long time. After ‘solving' the problem, it is still on my mind. </p>  <p>My database has many relationships (all many to one) between tables. I will sketch a situation: </p>  <pre><code>users  projects (user_id, …) forms (project_id, …) form_elements (form_id, …) form_element_lists (form_element_id, …) </code></pre>  <p>If somebody updates a row of the form_element_lists table I need to perform a check to make sure that the user is allowed to edit that specific row. My first thought would be to make 4 left joins. </p>  <p>But because updating the rows happens very often I added a ‘user_id’ to every table, so a security check can be performed without any join query. Else I would sometimes even have to make 6 join to find the user id. </p>  <p>After some sleepless nights I want to propose this question to you: is it better (for performance and database design) to make 6 joins, or to add an user_id field to all the tables? </p>
