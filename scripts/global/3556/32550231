<p>How can I edit the _search view (which is implemented by Yii2 Crud Generator), so that I can make two form fields on the same line? (Note that I have resized the form fields to 500px so that they can fit one line). Also, I would like the 'Search' and 'Reset' buttons to be on the same line too.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8p5CH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8p5CH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
