<p>I asked a question, but it was very dirty, and a lot of people didn't understand. So, I need to declare a final static field, that is only going to be initialized in the subclasses. I'll show an example:</p>  <pre><code>public class Job {     public static final String NAME; } </code></pre>  <hr>  <pre><code>public class Medic extends Job {      static {         NAME = "Medic";     } } </code></pre>  <hr>  <pre><code>public class Gardener extends Job {      static {         NAME = "Gardener";     } } </code></pre>  <p>Something like this. I know this code is not going to work, since the NAME field in the Job class needs to be initialized. What i want to do is to initialize that field individually in each subclass (Medic, Gardener).</p>
