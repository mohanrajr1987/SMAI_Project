<p>I'm trying to change a field's type dynamically based on a few conditions in SilverStripe.</p>  <p>I have a Field e.g. <code>CheckboxField()</code> which i need to copy and change the type of to something else e.g. <code>DropdownField()</code> or any other type of field.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this before the object is pushed to the form and whats the best practice here?</p>
