<p>I am using the Jquery 'Validate' plugin.</p>  <p>I have a situation with a hidden 'file' form field. I have a button that triggers the file field and allows the user to select an image. An image preview is then show in a div.</p>  <p>All that works fine.</p>  <p>I have need to ensure that the file meets the required standards (type, size etc). I am trapping all my errors just fine but when i have an erronious value I need to show the error to the user with a highlighted field. The <em>actual</em> file field is hidden, therefor the logical thing to do is highlight the div that holds the thumbnail.</p>  <p>Highlighting a div is childs play, but I am stumped as to where (and how) I ascertain whether the specific field has failed validation and therefor manually call my highlight.</p>  <p>I thought of using Valid() but that calls validate() which re-runs the validation. I am trying to avoid re-calling validate multiple times. However I will take advise on this if multiple calls to validate() for custom functionality is considered a valid way of using the validate plugin.</p>  <p>Answers and thoughts greatly received.</p>
