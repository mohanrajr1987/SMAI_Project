<p>A page with a form where a user can add different entries multiple times before submitting. With each entry, some of the data entered is displayed in a table at the top as an overview and as the user goes through and enters all their entries, the full view allows the user to 'submit' when then would take each entry and 'submit' as a whole. So you could in essence, have 3 objects as such to submit. </p>  <pre><code>var myObj1 = {     firstname: "Nic",     lastname: "Raboy",     website: "http://blog.nraboy.com" }  var myObj2 = {     firstname: "Nic",     lastname: "Raboy",     website: "http://blog.nraboy.com" }  var myObj3 = {     firstname: "Nic",     lastname: "Raboy",     website: "http://blog.nraboy.com" } </code></pre>  <p>So the idea here in angular that I want to do is post all of this at once from cached data that the user has stored as mentioned above like a session state or html local storage. Being that I am using angular, was looking at ngstorage and was wondering what the best approach to this kind of scenario would be?</p>  <p>Keep in mind, there could be 1 object or 4 or 6 objects. So will want to push all.</p>  <p>Is using ngstorage better than using local storage? Read pros and cons of each and curious what others may think on this.</p>  <p>Lastly, is it best to store these objects as just individual objects or in an array containing objects?</p>  <p>Thanks much.</p>
