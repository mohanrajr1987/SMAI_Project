<p>I'm writing a javascript plugin for sites, which basically consist of a javascript snippet that communicates with a dedicated server.</p>  <p>I need to find a way to hold some persistent data (persistent for the session is good enough) that will be accessible from all pages of the hosting site.</p>  <p>eg if example.com include my snippet, my storage should be consistent in all pages of example.com (http / https / subdomains /etc)</p>  <p>however, here's the tricky part:</p>  <ol> <li>some sites have a checkout page (e-commerce sites) that is actually on a different domain (eg <a href="https://sslcheckout.example.com" rel="nofollow">https://sslcheckout.example.com</a>), and I need my storage to be accessible there too.</li> <li>some part of the sites are http and some are https (not a problem with cookies, but a problem for stuff like local-storage etc) </li> <li>must support <em>most</em> browsers in market, including mobile (so no flash, and no experimental html5 features :/)</li> <li>I can't bother the users in any way, so I no asking permissions for stuff.</li> </ol>  <p>currently I'm using cookies, but this method doesn't work when the site switches to the different domain page.</p>  <p>what approach / method I should take to be able to keep the same local data throughout the entire session on all pages of the site?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>note: I'm using a django server and can take advantage of it too. but   performance is critical.</p>      <p>note2: I'm familiar with the iframes + PostMessage tricks but rather   not use them due to browsers support.</p> </blockquote>  <p>thanks!</p>
