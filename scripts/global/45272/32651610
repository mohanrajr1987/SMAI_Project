<p>I built an app using LocalStorage.</p>  <p>It stores a significant amount of objects under a single key, which I recently discovered that is reason for the DOM to be blocked, as the app has to JSON parse/stringify and store/retrieve the entire list every time I read or write to the "database".</p>  <p>Quoting an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32635398/2459543">answer from another question</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Since both LocalStorage and JSON stringify/parse happen synchronously on the main thread, it can block DOM rendering and will thus slow down your app.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The data insertion looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.recordlist = extractRecordJSONFromLocalStorage(); $scope.addRecord = function () {     $scope.recordlist.push(             {                 date: $scope.dateJson,                  time: $scope.time,                  car: $scope.carList.code,                  driver: $scope.driverList.name,                 from: $scope.locationList.place,                 destination: $scope.locationList2.place,                  pax: $scope.paxList,                 comments: [],                 arrival: '',                 inserted: '',                 cancelled:'',                 duration:''             }         );     jsonToRecordLocalStorage($scope.recordlist); }; </code></pre>  <p>Being so, I need to re-think the whole way I store and read that.</p>  <p>This way of doing it for me it made sense, as I was using AngularJS to read, filter and compare the objects stored in this one single key.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="row msf-row"       ng-repeat="record in filteredRecords = (recordlist | filter:dateFilter | filter: search )"       ng-hide="is.cancelled &amp;&amp; (!record.cancelled || record.cancelled === '') || has.comment &amp;&amp; (!record.comment || record.comment === '')"       ng-class="{ 'msf-cancelled': record.cancelled, 'msf-commented' : record.comment}"       ng-hide="!record.arrival &amp;&amp; !record.cancelled"       ng-show="record.cancelled"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any tips on how to migrate this, to which system and why?</p>  <p>I'd like to keep the AngularJS functionality. So if I don't read the whole file every time, how can I filter records?</p>  <p>You can see an <a href="http://cccctanger.com/fleet/" rel="nofollow">working example of the app here</a>.</p>  <p>I realize <strong>I'm missing key concepts</strong> on the way data should be stored and read. Any tip pointing to documentation/theory on that matter aside from direct answers, would also be highly appreciated. </p>
