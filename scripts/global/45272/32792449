<p>I backed-up my app that I am currently developing and was curious how I would be able to read the data that was stored in <code>window.localstorage</code>.</p>  <p>I found a file in the app container in <code>Libarary/Caches/file__0.localstorage</code> and opened it with SQLite. The variable seems to be a BLOB, how can I parse it?</p>  <p><code>SELECT  quote(value) FROM ItemTable</code> or <code>SELECT  hex(value) FROM ItemTable</code> do not return a text / json.</p>  <hr>  <p>Solution: do the hex query copy the output into a python variable <code>a</code></p>  <pre><code>a.decode('hex').replace('\x00','') </code></pre>  <p>Output is the JSON string</p>
