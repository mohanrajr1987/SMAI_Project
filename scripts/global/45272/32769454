<p>I'm currently planning on building an application using the ionic framework wrapping angularJS and cordova.</p>  <p>The app, once downloaded must be able to play its own audio files that were bundled with the application without streaming them from the internet.</p>  <p>Can anyone give guidance as to whether the phones 'hard drive' can be accessed to store audio files on? Or, if not whether the $localstorage facility would be suitable for storing audio files up to perhaps 50Mb?</p>
