<p>I am a classic ASP programmer and I have for some time now mixed the good old safe classic ASP with JQUERY with good results really. But I now have a project that requires more offline data processing than ever before. I'm learning as I go and this is my latest stumble...:</p>  <p>I need to take an array created server-side and populate it client-side ( and offline) in an html table which is powered by a jquery livesearch. Now I need to store the array (classic ASP) either in a cookie or local storage. Then be able to read it into an html table.</p>  <p>Here's how I would do it with classic ASP if I could rely on server-side connection:</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;tbody&gt;   &lt;%      For a = 0 to Pris_ant     %&gt;                          &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=Priser(a,0)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=Priser(a,1)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=Priser(a,2)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width="67"&gt;&lt;%=Priser(a,3)%&gt;,-&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width="67"&gt;&lt;%=Priser(a,4)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width="70"&gt;&lt;%=Priser(a,5)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;% Next %&gt;         &lt;/tbody&gt; </code></pre>  <p>OK, not the smoothest code but it works as long as I'm on a hard-line or in an area with good LTE connection. But the users are rarely on sites with good mobile data connection and I need to be able to generate this list from a local storage even IF there's no network. A.k.a I can open a locally stored HTML page and read the data from the local storage.</p>  <p>So the BIG question is how do I do this in the simplest manner possible ? I've searched high and low and i'm none the wiser. So any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
