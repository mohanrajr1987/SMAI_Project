<p>I created app with static form and json database and everything was okay. But after that i created form dynamically for to make single page app. Form submission works well. The problem is: when i close my app and open it again i can't add, update and delete the old articles that was created before closing the page with app. I can modified only articles created during the current session.  I pulled my project on github and make demo page. Hope it helps more than jsfiddle. I will appreciate any help and any person who point me on my mistake.  I was working whole week and made mistake in final step. </p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/OlgaMaraeva/cookbook/tree/master" rel="nofollow">Code</a></p>  <p>Demo <a href="http://luckyframe74.com/demo/cookbook/#" rel="nofollow">http://luckyframe74.com/demo/cookbook/#</a></p>  <p>I store my database in <a href="https://github.com/OlgaMaraeva/cookbook/blob/master/src/model/Book.js" rel="nofollow">this file</a> </p>  <p>and call dynamic form <a href="https://github.com/OlgaMaraeva/cookbook/blob/master/createBook.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>  and rest files in this folder.</p>  <p>Code activated by buttons</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/OlgaMaraeva/cookbook/blob/master/src/view/buttons.js" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/OlgaMaraeva/cookbook/blob/master/src/view/buttons.js</a></p>
