<p>It looks like Angulars <code>$templateCache</code> is simply storing the templates in memory  - so huge amount of them has significant effect on overall app performance.</p>  <p>I have crazy idea to store all the templates in localStorage and decorate <code>$templateCache</code> to use localStorage instead of memory.</p>  <p>My questionis:</p>  <p>1) Does localStorage float in memory in any way or it's always accessed from the disc?</p>  <p>2) Does this seems somehow logical thing to do, knowing templates never change?</p>
