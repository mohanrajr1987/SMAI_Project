<p>I am new to JavaFx and tried to implement its browser in my application. Since reloading all images on every new startup is quite time-consuming, <strong>I'd like to store them in some cache directory</strong>, but have been failing to do so. I tried using <code>setUserDataDirectory(...)</code>, but that only leads to an empty folder called <code>localstorage</code> and an empty <code>.lock</code> file being created.</p>  <p>I then found this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11968471/caching-in-javafx-webview">SO thread</a>, but firstly, I am not yet allowed to comment there and secondly, it only seems to address JavaFx 2.2. Does what has been posted there still hold true for JavaFx 8? If so: is there a simple way to implement such a <code>URLConnection</code> cache?</p>  <p>Many thanks for any help :)</p>
