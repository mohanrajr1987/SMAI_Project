<p>I store a unique ID in a client's browser's local storage using AmplifyJS so when they revisit the website they can resume their checkout process.</p>  <p>But what if they visit my site once, get the ID stored in local storage, and then never visit the site again? How do I get their browser to automatically delete that local storage data if their browser never touches my site again?</p>  <p>Local storage data doesn't seem to automatically expire.</p>
