<p>I painted this picture to demonstrate what my final goal is.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPsUQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPsUQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>Short description:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>If nothing is changed in form or there's already exact same values saved, <strong>"save values" button</strong> does nothing</li> <li>If something is changed in form, <strong>"save values" button</strong> saves those values to localStorage and bind with numbered element (<strong>"1" in picture</strong>) and with input it came from</li> <li>If numbered element is clicked, it fills the inputs that were changed with values that were saved</li> <li>If something is changed in form &amp; it's not the same as already saved values, <strong>"save values" button</strong> saves to element 2</li> <li><strong>Red "X"</strong> in numbered element deletes saved values from localStorage binded to that element</li> </ul>  <hr>  <p>Im not here to get the whole working solution from you guys, don't worry. I've researched for a week &amp; I can't wrap my mind around it. It would be easy without binding to elements &amp; "grouping".</p>  <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>How to bind localStorage values to numbered elements <strong>and also</strong> to input fields it first came from?</li> <li>How to "treat" saved values in localStorage as group which is binded to numbered element? For example: delete values only binded to that numbered element if delete is pressed.</li> <li>How to check if same values already exist (also taking into account many values, it's easy with 1)?</li> </ul>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10333230/save-input-data-to-localstorage-on-button-click">This question</a> shows how to set &amp; get value to/from localStorage.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9943220/how-to-delete-a-localstorage-item-when-the-browser-window-tab-is-closed">This question</a> shows how to remove value from localStorage.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3262605/html5-localstorage-check-if-item-is-set">This question</a> shows how to check if localStorage value exists.</p>
