<p>I have everything in my extension working apart from one thing! I want to clear the local storage of this extension through popup.js. It's a simple extension that saves form data from a certain domain.</p>  <p>Currently, in my content script (save.js) I'm accessing local storage through localStorage[key] however it seems I'm unable to do this through popup.js and I get an 'undefined' which I assume it expected behaviour.</p>  <p>I have tried localStorage.clear(); from my popup.js but this has no effect. Presumably because it's looking to clear non existent localStorage from within the extension itself?</p>  <p>How can I access and clear the local storage that my save.js has been using from popup.js?</p>  <p><strong>popup.js</strong></p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>document.getElementById('clearAllData').addEventListener('click', clear);  function clear(){ 	localStorage.clear();  }    </code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p><strong>Snippet of how I'm saving data in save.js</strong></p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>function saveTicket(ticket, contents) { 	localStorage[ticketID] = contents; }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
