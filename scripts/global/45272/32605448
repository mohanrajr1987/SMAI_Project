<p>I am just trying to hide something when a localStorage key is set to null, and show it when the key is not null. The key is called <code>articles</code>and the way I am trying to check is:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.isEmpty = function isEmpty() {   return localStorage.getItem('articles') !== null; }; </code></pre>  <p>then in my html:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;li ng-show="isEmpty()"&gt; There is actually something to see here &lt;/li&gt; </code></pre>  <p>the local storage key (from chrome dev tools) looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>**key**         **Value** articles          null </code></pre>  <p>is there any particular reason why this isnt working? Where did I go wrong?</p>
