<p>I have the following variable <code>localStorage.timesDisplayed</code> in the browser's local storage. </p>  <p>I am wondering if there is a way to clear that variable with Javascript when browser is restarted. </p>  <p>I can use : <code>delete localStorage.timesDisplayed</code> to delete the variable, but I am not sure how to detect that the browser has been restarted on the page load. </p>
