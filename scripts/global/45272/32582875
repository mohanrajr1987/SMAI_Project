<p>Can the localStorage be cleared for a specific application?</p>  <p>The usecase is the following: - we have a self built application called "Agent Cockpit" which is sharing the same domain name like Application1 - this agent cockpit uses local storage for some settings - all these settings are lost when someone clicks "logout" on application1. We have noticed that when loging out of Application1 the command "LocalStorage.clear() is submitted which removes all items in the LocatStorage.</p>  <p>-- Using localstorage key with application identifier can I Prevent the above . However I Have the rights to make changes in the " Agent Cockpit " application only . Is there any documentation on how to achieve this?  Or is it necessary to have a seperate key for all the applications using the localstorage ? Because making the changes in application1 is currently not possible.</p>  <p>How do i implement this?</p>
