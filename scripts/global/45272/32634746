<p>I created an app that stores, compares, filters and takes statistics out of a collection of records. I've done it so it works offline, as in some user cases the user might not have constant (or at all) access to internet.</p>  <p>My problem is that after I've included ~60 records, the app starts to behave <strong>really</strong> slow. For instance, I list a collection of simple objects from LocalStorage into a ng-model (Select list), and after those ~60 records are in, to open the Select box will be seriously slowed down.</p>  <p>What could the problem be? I'm thinking, either some function is sucking more resources than necessary, or LocalStorage is not intended for such uses?</p>  <p>I'm starting to get into PouchDB, would you say that migrating all to Pouch instead of LocalStorage would be a good move?</p>  <p>I can't paste the whole controller here as it's huge, but I've put an online version for testing. You can see it <a href="http://cccctanger.com/fleet/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>For you not to have to create 60 records just to see the effect, you can <a href="http://cccctanger.com/fleet/60records.csv" rel="nofollow">download this CSV</a> and import it in the app.</p>  <p>In order to import, the pass for Edit Mode is: <strong>admin</strong> </p>  <p>Let's see if someone has a tip for this one!</p>
