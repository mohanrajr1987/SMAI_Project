<p>I am building a directive that handles out courses, part of this is saving course data in local storage so the user can resume. </p>  <p>When the data changes i call this function</p>  <pre><code>function setLocalStorage(){     if(!preview){         $localStorage.scorm = scope.scorm     } } </code></pre>  <p>I also call is when they first load up the course</p>  <p>My problem is that the data is not updated in local storage.</p>  <p>When i debug i can see that <code>$localstorage.scorm</code> is getting updated in chrome console but the data in the actual local storage is unchanged.</p>
