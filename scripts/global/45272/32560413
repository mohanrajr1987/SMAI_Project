<p>we are using SonarQube 5.1.2 on a domain like <code>sonarqube.companyname.com</code>.</p>  <p>Because of a firefox bug (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1064466" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1064466</a>) the local storage quota isn't based on the subdomain. As we are using many applications on domains with the suffix <code>.companyname.com</code> which also uses localStorage I got the following error in the JavaScript console:</p>  <pre><code>NS_ERROR_DOM_QUOTA_REACHED: Persistent storage maximum size reached </code></pre>  <p>And the result looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RjH48.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/RjH48.png</a></p>  <p>Is there anything I can do? Maybe a config setting to disable the localstorage translation caching?</p>  <p>Has anyone else the same problem?</p>
