<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>try {         myVideoView.setMediaController(mediaControls);         File mydir = getDir("myDir", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);         myVideoView.setVideoPath(mydir.getPath()+"/fileName.3gp");     } catch (Exception e) {         Log.e("Error", e.getMessage());         e.printStackTrace();     }      myVideoView.requestFocus();     myVideoView.setOnPreparedListener(new OnPreparedListener() {         // Close the progress bar and play the video         public void onPrepared(MediaPlayer mp) {             progressDialog.dismiss();             myVideoView.seekTo(position);             if (position == 0) {                 myVideoView.start();             } else {                 myVideoView.pause();             }         }     }); </code></pre>  <p>within onCreate() method. The problem is that it throws an IOException, and says that <code>Unable to open the content</code>. It works perfect if I use <code>myVideoView.setVideoURI(path/to/server)</code> instead of <code>myVideoView.setVideoPath(path/to/local/storage)</code>. All permissions at <code>Manifest.xml</code> are fine, and it does not says that the file was not found or something. It says unable to open it. It is not a video format problem either, because is the same video when I play it from server. If this is a useful info, I have another activity in background (same app), and the VideoView activity is in foreground. Thank you!</p>
