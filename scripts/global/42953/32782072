<p>I have multiple SQL Server Reporting Services instances (Production, UAT, Development, QA, etc...).  I'd like to be able to "refresh" them from a master (Production) in the same manner as other SQL Databases.  </p>  <p>Normally a backup from Production, restore to Development works, but with Reporting Services there seems to be an issue (user accounts, permissions, etc...) plus I'd like to keep the Data Sources pointing to Development on Development after the restore.</p>  <p>Have others run into this issue with SSRS and how do they resolve it?</p>
