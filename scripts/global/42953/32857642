<p>i am doing a Lab Test web application Project.In this ,Customer will apply a order with list of lab Test.Once the lab test completed , i need to create a report with all the test conducted. The test will be different from each other.i can create a query for desired result.but the Table columns will be dynamic and number of tables(different test have different table) also will be dynamic.</p>  <p>As far as i know , we can create one static report format and bind the data table to it.or we can create a row group and colum group in matrix(i got from some links)and dynamically hide and visible the column.</p>  <p>my requirement is bit different and i can't make it static. is there any way to do this dynamic in SSRS Or any other tool ?. Or i have to go back to old school where i need to create report format(excel,pdf)in code(C#). Please advice some tips, Links or article which can solve this issue. help is appreciated.</p>
