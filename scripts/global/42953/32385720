<p>I'm way out of my element with SSRS Expressions.  I'm hoping someone could lend me a hand.</p>  <p>I have 2 name fields:</p>  <ul> <li><code>ContactName</code> </li> <li><code>BusinessName</code></li> </ul>  <p>If <code>ContactName</code> is NOT NULL then only use the <code>ContactName</code>. However, if <code>ContactName</code> is NULL and <code>BusinessName</code> is NOT NULL then use the <code>BusinessName</code>.</p>  <p>I tried the following:</p>  <pre><code>    =IIF(NOT          Fields!ContactName.Value Is Nothing,           Fields!ContactName.Value,           Fields!BusinessName.Value         ) </code></pre>  <p>However, it isn't picking up when I only have a <code>BusinessName</code>.</p>  <p>What do I need to do to also display the <code>BusinessName</code> when I only have a <code>BusinessName</code>?</p>  <p><strong>Just as an update:</strong></p>  <p>The answer was a combination of the IIF statement and a check to see if the value was also an empty string.</p>
