<p>I am using a tablix in an rdlc report which uses a flat (Single row datasource), however the values which are displayed are in multiple rows.  I need to add alternate row coloring for the same,I cannot use a RowNumber as I am working off a flat dataset. Are there any other approaches I can take ?  TIA</p>
