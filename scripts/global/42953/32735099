<p>I am trying to create an SSRS report from an SSAS cube with the following format</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lpJ2i.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lpJ2i.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So what I did is create a database table with recursive hierarchy which we can call here a location dimension (dimLocation) and it has the following layout</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/G094P.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/G094P.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Then under SSAS multidimensional model, I have created a self-joined Dimension which generates the following hierarchy</p>  <ul> <li>Americas  <ul> <li>USA</li> </ul></li> <li>Europe  <ul> <li>France  <ul> <li>Paris</li> <li>Marseille</li> </ul></li> <li>Germany</li> </ul></li> <li>Africa</li> </ul>  <p>Next, I created the SSAS cube using my fact table and the self-joined dimension, deployed it and tried to use it in SSRS, but I was not able to create the layout above.</p>  <p>What I have tried so far, is to create a Tablix with a group on columns, set the group properties to group on [Parent_ID.UniqueName] and recursive parent on [Parent_ID.ParentUniqueName]. It almost worked fine except that the groups are being expended horizontally and not vertically as my expected layout.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6wVqb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6wVqb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I am starting this project from scratch, which means I am free to change the table structures etcâ€¦ Is it possible to achieve such layout with my actual cube/dimensions? Or maybe I should redesign my dimension source table and create another type of hierarchy than a recursive one?</p>
