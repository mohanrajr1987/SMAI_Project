<p>My report structure:</p>  <ul> <li>header</li> <li>tablix in rectangle</li> <li>footer</li> </ul>  <p>from reportviewer and visual studio all looks great, but when i render pdf i'm getting document consisting of 3 pages, first (with header) is ok, but the rest gets an empty column on the right</p>  <p>i try to put each column and row in rectangle etc. i'm sure that size of my report body is ok (body + margins &lt;= page)</p>  <p>example with colors (dark blue - subreport in rectangle, yellow - main container): <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vp8hR.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vp8hR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>height is correct, but width from second page is too large</p>
