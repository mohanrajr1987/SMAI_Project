<p>I have designed and tested a report and it's working fine.<br> After some refinements, we manage to reduce it so it takes only 1/8 of a page, so at 2 per "row" we can fit 4 rows in a regular A4 page.<br> Now, a requirement dropped out of nowhere saying that this report must be printed multiple times in a same page.  </p>  <p>Is there a way to re-utilize my previous report as a template, maybe throw it into a "foreach"?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 1</strong><br> I've managed to use the "subreport", what i need now is a way to add them on the fly, based on how many rows the dataset returns...</p>
