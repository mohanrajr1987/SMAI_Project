<p>I would like to ask your opinion and give feedback on my solution. If possible, someone could advise anything, way around and how to make things work effectively. </p>  <p><strong>1. Let me first explain what is needed and what we have.</strong></p>  <p>My employer has audit management system which helps working with control projects that contains all the data of projects (information, work done, dates, issues found, recommendations). After completion of every project a complex report is to be generated.</p>  <p>Report is formatted Word document containing heading, body, couple of tables to be filled manually and list of field, which are to be filled with project data automatically. </p>  <p>The system has built-in report constructor based on XML and Word template (.dotx), but its capabilities are not enough to generate large and complicated reports (takes too long time).</p>  <p><strong>2. What I've come to and decided to implement:</strong></p>  <p>1) I've created and formatted a Word template and XML links to fill         easy data (like project code, aim, background, dates)</p>  <p>2) The main body I've managed to extract only from database         directly. So, I've written my SQL code. Then, to present it in         readable way I've decided to use SSRS. So, the person types his         parameters and get output from DB directly.</p>  <p>3) Then a person exports SSRS report into Word/Excel and copy-pastes         it into generated Word template.</p>  <p><strong>3. The problems are:</strong></p>  <p>1) You have 2 split documents (Word report generated from     template and SSRS export file Word/Excel). </p>  <p>Are there any workarounds to merge them automatically? (End users     need the process of report generation to be as easy as possible, one     button click desired).</p>  <p>2)  From SSRS you get table, but the data needs to be formatted as     text (or at least 1 column, 1 row table with transparent borders).     Okay, I've managed to get 1 column, but still multiple rows.</p>  <p>3) The formatting of result export file from SSRS may be very ugly     and quite different from Word report, which requires manual     formatting.</p>  <p>I hope someone could help me solve any of these or propose a different solution.</p>
