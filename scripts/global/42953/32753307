<p>I am trying to read an SSRS-generated Excel file using C# and it is giving me issues when trying to connect using OLEDB. I am using the connection string: </p>  <pre><code>string connStr = String.Format("Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source={0};Extended Properties=\"Excel 12.0 Xml;HDR={1};IMEX=1\";", this.Path, hdr); </code></pre>  <p>The above works perfectly when I create an Excel sheet of my own but with an SSRS generated Excel sheet I am getting the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An unhandled exception of type 'System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException' occurred in System.Data.dll</p> </blockquote>  <p>Additional information: External table is not in the expected format.</p>  <p>Is there a step I am missing somewhere? </p>  <p>Update: It seems to work when I delete the headers manually after it has been generated from SSRS. I am not sure why the headers will cause the error when trying to connect.</p>
