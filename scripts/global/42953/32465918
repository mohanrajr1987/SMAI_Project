<p>I am rendering ssrs report on button click event and also downloading pdf document which contains expenses receipts.</p>  <p>Requirement is to show report on screen and download pdf.</p>  <p>If i use the following code then reportviewer doesn't render report but i can download pdf.  </p>  <pre><code> content = myMemoryStream.ToArray();    Response.ContentType = "application/pdf";   Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment;filename=" + "hello" + ".pdf");   Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);   Response.Write(content); </code></pre>  <p>I have tried rendering reporting after response.write but no luck. Also Response.End didn't make a difference either.</p>
