<p>Can someone please point me in the right direction? I'd like to generate a list of help desk tickets, with their respective child tickets (if exists) listed directly below them. This will ultimately be an SSRS report, but I just don't know if the logic is best handled in the SQL query or in SSRS (grouping/sorts/etc).</p>  <p>Our Help Desk system allows for tickets to be designated as child tickets of a parent ticket (i.e., a ticket is generated by a user, and the tech then creates a related new ticket (child ticket) for some back-end work from our network guys). I'm working on a SSRS report that lists all open tickets over 60 days old. I'd like any child tickets to be located directly beneath the parent ticket and sorted by date created.</p>  <p>The report is grouped, initially, by location. Each ticket record, whether the ticket is a child or parent, will display the same data (Ticket No, Ticket Subject, Contact, Date Started, Status, etc.), and all tickets will have a unique ticket number. So, this is largely a grouping/sorting issue. Ideally, once in SSRS, I'll be able to format the group heirarchy, so that child tickets are visually distinct in some way (indented, borders/lines/etc.)</p>  <p>I just can't wrap my head around the logic. I can provide code if it helps, so you can see the existing query, but I primarily just need an idea of which direction to go.</p>  <p>EDIT: I should add that all tickets have a PARENTID field, which is NULL if the ticket is not the child of another ticket.</p>  <p>2ND EDIT: Read up on CTE recursion, felt good about it, then was reminded that I'm working with SQL Server 2000. I might have to get creative. Maybe this will be the motivation required to upgrade to 2008R2. Any ideas for this type of recursion on a turn of the millennium database management system?</p>  <p>Thank you,</p>  <p>Robert</p>
