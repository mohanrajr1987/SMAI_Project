<p>Ive got data that has 3 different grouping levels.  Lets call them A, B and C.  Then the details.  I always seem to have trouble when I want to put 3 or more "levels" in one column.  What is the trick to doing this.  I cant remember, but I know ive done it before.</p>  <p>A   - group sum<br/> B   - group sum<br/> C   - group sum<br/> </p>  <h2>      Details</h2>  <p>Grant total<br/></p>
