<p>I have a table that looks something like this</p>  <pre><code>Product | Language | Cost ---------------------------- X       | En       | 5 X       | D        | 5 Y       | Jp       | 10 Y       | Sp        | 10 </code></pre>  <p>And I want it to look like this</p>  <pre><code>Product | En | D | Jp | Sp ------------------- X       | 5  | 5 | 0  | 0 Y       | 0  | 0 | 10 | 10 </code></pre>  <p>So what I want to do is to take all the values in the Language column and use them as column headers (done by printing the column as a row) and then match the Cost value to the new table where the the different languages are headers instead of values in a column. </p>  <p>How to do this in Reporting Services? Thanks</p>
