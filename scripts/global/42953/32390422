<p>I developed a SSRS tabular report using below query</p>  <pre><code>select Department,  CONVERT(DECIMAL(10,2), sum(si.GrossPrice) / 100.0) gross  from SaleItem si, Sale sa where GrossPrice != 0 and sa.SaleID = si.SaleID and sa.StartDate between '2015-01-03 04:00:01' and '2015-08-04 04:00:00' group by Department  order by Department </code></pre>  <p>and it give the o/p like below screen </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykVtZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykVtZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now I need to show the grand total of the amount. How can I do it. I done grouping of the items in first column then include sub total but that give me subtotal after each line of the item. I need grand total of entire amount. I am new to SSRS.</p>
