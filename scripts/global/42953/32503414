<p>I am attempting to control the visibility of an error message with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>=IIf((Lookup(Parameters!FA.Value, Fields!fa_num.Value,Fields!LastName.Value,"Advisor_Numbers")=""),False, True) </code></pre>  <p>What this theoretically should do is look at the FA # inputted by the user, then look within the "Advisor_Numbers" dataset for a match in fa_num...and once found to check if the last name of the advisor is empty.  If this is true: return false. Otherwise, return true.</p>  <p>This code always returns false despite the sample FA numbers I use existing in the Advisor_Numbers table. Is my syntax for writing a parameter within a lookup incorrect?</p>  <p>Ideally I'd just like to lookup if the parameter exists within the table without involving the last name.</p>
