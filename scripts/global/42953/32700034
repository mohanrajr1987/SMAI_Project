<p>I need to migrate a CR report to RS. </p>  <p>I have two Methods, that are basically two queries, one is called "Products" the other one is called "Volume".</p>  <p>Both these datasets have a field called ID. The idea is to count ProductsID = VolumeID. Can I use a lookup as an expression inside RS that counts when lookup is not equal to Nothing? Or I have to do a code to do that?</p>  <p>EDIT: Let me add more information. Crystal Report is managing these in the Data Layer of the web app like this:</p>  <pre><code>                DataRow drVol = vols.Rows.Find(new Object[] { id, idEzd });                 if (drVol != null)                 {                     if (drVol["Volume"] != System.DBNull.Value)                         cRow.Volume = (isNormalReport ? Convert.ToDecimal(drVol["Volume"]) : Convert.ToDecimal(drVol["Volume"]));                     else                         cRow.Volume = 0;                      dset.Compradores.Rows.Add(cRow);                 } </code></pre>  <p>So in this case I verified that RS is giving me an X amount of rows while CR is giving me another amount of rows.</p>  <p>The Idea is to duplicate this on an expression or VB code inside RS. As you can see, we have to filter the <code>drVol != null</code>, RS is bringing all the rows. </p>  <p>I know a Lookup function can be used in this case as:</p>  <pre><code>Lookup(Fields!id.Value &amp; Fields!idEzd.Value, Fields!id.Value &amp; Fields!idEzd.Value,Fields!Givemethisfield.Value,"Dataset") </code></pre>  <p>But can I use this Lookup expression inside a code to count? The counter should be something like this (Then I should add the lookup or an if that equals that vlookup, can the code see the two datasets?):</p>  <pre><code>Dim count=0 as integer Public Function Counter() as Integer  count = count + 1 return count  End Function  Public Function GetCounter () as integer  return count  End Function </code></pre>  <p>Then create a Calculated Field for example "Counter" with the expression</p>  <pre><code>=Code.Counter() </code></pre>  <p>And then make the sum of that calculated field:</p>  <pre><code>=Sum(Fields!Counter.Value) </code></pre>  <p>But is not working, not even the counter, is giving me 0.</p>  <p>Sorry if I made a mistake in the Visual Basic code, I don't program in Visual.</p>  <p>EDIT2: I saw some workaround on MSDN, something like:</p>  <pre><code>Lookup(Fields!id.Value &amp; Fields!idEzd.Value, Fields!id.Value &amp; Fields!idEzd.Value,Fields!Givemethisfield.Value,"Dataset").Lenght </code></pre>  <p>It makes sense as a lookup is an Array.</p>  <p>The problem is, either if I choose one scope or the other, I still have the problem that some fields can't be seen for example if the fields <code>id</code> and <code>idezd</code> are on Dataset1 and <code>Givemethisfield</code> is on Dataset2, it will either not see the id,idEzd or Givemethisfield.</p>
