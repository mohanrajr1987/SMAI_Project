<p>So I am attempting to reorganize a report I put together. I had the running totals working before the redesign, but I have been pouring over this for a day and can't figure out why it is no longer functioning as I had thought.</p>  <p>The sum values are correct here, but it keeps accumulating them and not spreading them out over the area paths I've defined (which are populating obviously).</p>  <p>I have the sprint and area name linked in a hierarchy for the row groups then followed by this expression:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bMvHl.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bMvHl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code> =RunningValue(Fields!Sev_1_Count.Value, SUM, "RowGroup") </code></pre>  <p>Each column after the area name is defining a severity level of defects, just for context. The Sev_1_Count expression should take the count of all defects in this severity level then spread them across their associated area names. Which worked in the previous version... I just can't for the life of me figure why it won't work now. Thoughts? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v9Wz7.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v9Wz7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
