<p>I know this seems like a duplicate question, but for some reason I can't get it to work. </p>  <p>In my matrix, I'm trying to <strong>freeze my row headers</strong> so when I scroll right I can still see them. </p>  <p>I've tried clicking the small arrow to go into <code>advanced mode</code> and set <code>FixedData</code> to <code>True</code> on the top most static property, but that didn't work. </p>  <p>I've also tried right clicking the tablix, going into the properties and checking <code>keep header visible while scrolling</code>, and I still get the same error. </p>  <p>The exact error says, </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"The table "matrix1" includes a table header or column with   FixedHeader set to true. This is not allowed on data regions inside   other data regions."</p> </blockquote>  <ul> <li>What does this error mean exactly? </li> <li>Am I setting the wrong property to True? </li> <li>Do I need to create another row or column? </li> </ul>  <p>This has been bugging me for awhile, and any advice would be appreciated, thanks.</p>
