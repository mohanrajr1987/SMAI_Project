<p>SSRS - SQL 2008 SSRS Version 3.0. Need to run a NOT IN, but takes an extremely long time to run</p>  <p>Have seen the "Stacia" post about using a filter and I don't seem to have it right. <a href="http://blog.datainspirations.com/2011/01/20/working-with-reporting-services-filters-part-4-creating-a-not-in-filter/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.datainspirations.com/2011/01/20/working-with-reporting-services-filters-part-4-creating-a-not-in-filter/</a></p>  <p>In the Tablix of the report, I have put in the for the Filter the following:</p>  <pre><code>=Iif(InStr(Join(Parameters!FilterList.Value,","),Fields!Status.Value)=0,True,False) </code></pre>  <p>What I am trying to do is to show records that are not Cancelled.</p>  <p>Even doing a simple filter:</p>  <ul> <li>Expression: [Status]</li> <li>Operator &lt;></li> <li>Value Cancelled</li> </ul>  <p>Still seems to take an extremely long time.</p>  <p>We could have the following Status conditions:</p>  <ul> <li>Cancelled</li> <li>Closed</li> <li>Open</li> <li>Resolved</li> </ul>  <p>If I take this the opposite way and look for all tickets that are cancelled (filter) in SSRS, the results come back pretty quickly.</p>  <p>UPDATE: if I put in the Filter for the Query for the Report:</p>  <ul> <li>Closed</li> <li>Open</li> <li>Resolved</li> </ul>  <p>And just simply leave Cancelled out, that should work OK. Thanks.</p>
