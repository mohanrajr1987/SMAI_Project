<p>I started using BIDS to create SQL reports. I have been taking previously created queries and doing some minor edits to them to make them work. I ran into a problem with this query and do not know how to solve the problem. </p>  <p>When I run the report every single parameter is repeated for how many times the query returns that value as seen in the screenshots below. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a4RCZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a4RCZ.png" alt="selling location"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NcAPI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NcAPI.png" alt="written by"></a></p>  <p>I just want the parameter to return one instance of each possible value. That way when those values are selected all records matching those parameter values are returned. </p>  <p>Here is my query:</p>  <pre><code>Declare @writtenby varchar(20) Declare @sellinglocation varchar(6)  Select DISTINCT      so.sonumber     ,so.customerpo     ,so.customershipto     ,cst.name     , so.quotenumber     ,so.type     ,so.dateadded     ,so.acktoname     ,so.writtenby     ,so.sellinglocation     ,vw.totalvalue From       tblsoso so     ,tblarcustomershipto cst     ,vwsoSOTotalvalue vw where      vw.sonumber = so.sonumber      AND so.status ='Open'     AND cst.customershipto = so.customershipto      AND so.writtenby IN ('fredmond','jdilsaver','jmentzer')      AND so.sellinglocation IN ('01','02') </code></pre>  <p>I've tried putting the <code>where</code> clause as </p>  <pre><code>AND so.writtenby IN (@writtenby)  AND so.sellinglocation IN (@sellinglocation) </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>AND so.writtenby = @writtenby  AND so.sellinglocation = @sellinglocation </code></pre>  <p>but neither worked. I generally have been able to get by with the help of google, but most scenarios I run into are saying the query is going to have to be rewritten because you can't use <code>group by</code> with this query. My SQL skills are very limited and I am trying not to have to rewrite this just because of my parameter issue. </p>  <p>Any tips or tricks or general know how is more than welcome.</p>
