<p>I'm trying to create a report in SSRS which has to export nicely to Excel without merged / hidden columns and rows. To do that I've learned I have to for instance align my subreport width and height with my cell width and height and don't use width and height with more than 2 decimals (e.g. 0,55398cm).</p>  <p>But SSRS in some cases won't let me? When I enter a width (cell level) of 4,5cm; 0,55cm it keeps changing it to 4,5cm; 0,55001cm?</p>  <p>Not sure if this will influence my row / column behaviour in Excel..</p>  <p>Regards,</p>  <p>Mike</p>
