<p>I have a report with two date: <code>ProductCreatedDate, ProductSoldDate</code>. User need to be able to filter either on <code>createdDate</code> or <code>SoldDate</code> not both. How can I do this? I am thinking of creating three parameters. First one will give user an option to select which date they want to filter on. For example:</p>  <pre><code>First Parameter- Pick Date type: Product Created Date Product Sold Date Second parameter based on first parameter value- Start Date (calendar form) Third parameter based on first parameter value- End Date (Calendar form) </code></pre>  <p>Let's say user selects value <code>Product Created Date</code> as a first parameter </p>  <p>Then second and third (start and end date calendar) parameter should be based on <code>ProductCreatedDate</code> filter</p>  <p>Any suggestion, on how to do this?</p>  <p>What I have tried hoping it will work:</p>  <pre><code>WHERE (CASE WHEN @Type = 'Created' THEN ProductCreatedDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate END) OR (CASE WHEN @Type = 'Sold' THEN ProductSoldDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate END) </code></pre>
