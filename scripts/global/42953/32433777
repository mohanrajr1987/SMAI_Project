<p>Sometimes I receive the following error, when I try to open reports on browser. More interestingly, this problem is solved by itself and occurs from time to time. What is the reason for that? I've read some other posts, users there restart the service to solve the issue. But how can I prevent this error? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gAQgf.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gAQgf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>One more question: I'm developing Reports on Visual Studio 2008, how can I find Report Server name, so that to restart it?</p>
