<p>I have a custom code that performs a calculation to calculate the difference between specific columns, the code works perfect and there is no issues with it.</p>  <p>However, I am updating a number of my reports to dynamically switch between two versions.  Due to this the call to the custom code needs different parameters.</p>  <p>I attempted to solve this by wrapping the functions in an IIF statement however, doing this causes it to run the code twice regardless of the evaluation of the IIF statement.  So when I call my function to return the difference, it is an oddly doubled value.</p>  <p>I can solve this by editing my custom code but I would prefer not to since it would involve a large update of previously created reports.</p>  <p>The expression that I am using is located below:</p>  <pre><code>=IIF(Today() &lt; Fields!StartDate.Value, Nothing,      IIF(Parameters!LaunchID.Value = 0, Code.ChangeCalc(SUM(Fields!Customers.Value), Fields!Grouped.Value),         Code.ChangeCalc(SUM(Fields!Customers.Value), Fields!Grouped.Value, Fields!IsVSegment.Value)     ) ) </code></pre>  <p>I have changed the second call to the custom code to a static value and it returns the correct values.</p>  <p><strong>Example of the problem:</strong></p>  <p>Column 1 = 4</p>  <p>Column 2 = 42</p>  <p>Change = -80</p>  <p>Column 3 = 198</p>  <p>Column 4 = 205</p>  <p>Change = -410</p>  <p><strong>It should be:</strong></p>  <p>Change = -38</p>  <p><strong>The incorrect calculation it is performing:</strong></p>  <p>4 - 42 - 42 = -80</p>  <p>198 - 198 - 205 - 205 = -410</p>  <p>For some reason the first column only takes the first value once but any subsequent column doubles the values.</p>  <p>Any assistance on what I would consider odd behavior would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>If you need any more clarification, please let me know.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
