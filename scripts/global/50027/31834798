<p>I have published a <code>Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight</code> application to the market. And among many users, some of them are getting (<code>3 or 4 were reported out of 8000 users</code>) <strong>app crash issue</strong>.</p>  <p>I checked with the issue on our end and provided all possible steps to prevent the crash. But unfortunately the users are getting the same app crash. <em>AND THE USERS AND ME ARE EQUALLY WORRIED.!! :(</em></p>  <p>When I checked with the dev center crash reports I found the following exception details which I never get on debugging the device</p>  <blockquote>   <p>unknown!{0DFF7A2F-51F8-4DE8-8E37-5E97FAB540C0}_Task_disconnected_while_still_running:_server_task_currentState_=_Active,<em>targetState</em>=_Active.</p>      <p>MISSING_DUMP_EM_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_DEADA444_unknown.dll!{0DFF7A2F-51F8-4DE8-8E37-5E97FAB540C0}_Task_disconnected_while_still_running:_server_task_currentState_=_Active,<em>targetState</em>=_Active.</p>      <p>aghost.exe!{0DFF7A2F-51F8-4DE8-8E37-5E97FAB540C0}_Quiesce_Hang</p> </blockquote>  <p>And I noticed that most users are getting the crash on navigating in to <strong>a page where all phone contacts with images are displaying</strong>. Will it kill the app by any chance?</p>  <p>Can anyone please explain when these above crashes occurs and how can I resolve it ? Since it is not replicated on our end till now.</p>
