<p>I am trying to access the appointments from the Windows Phone calendar</p>  <pre><code>public async Task &lt;AppointmentStore&gt; getAppointments()     {          AppointmentStore appointmentStore = await  AppointmentManager.RequestStoreAsync(AppointmentStoreAccessType.AllCalendarsReadOnly);         return appointmentStore;      } </code></pre>  <p>I have already the "enabled" the "Appointments" in the Capabilities tab of PackageManifest file. In the other solutions on the stack overflow it was suggested to enable the required permission which I did. I have also ran the Visual Studio as an administrator. However, the system continues to throws the same unauthorized access exception.</p>
