<p>So I have two ListPickers, <code>Device Type</code> and <code>Device Name</code>.</p>  <p>If I select <em>Tablet</em> in <code>Device Type</code>, I want the <code>Device Name</code> ListPicker to show options like <em>Ipad</em>, <em>Dell Venue 8</em>, etc.</p>  <p>If I select <em>Phone</em> in <code>Device Type</code>, I want the <code>Device Name</code> ListPicker to show options like <em>Iphone</em>, <em>Samsung Galaxy</em>, etc and so on.</p>  <p>So how can I go about making a data binding between these two ListPickers and also implement <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> so changes in one ListPicker are dynamically reflected in the other?</p>
