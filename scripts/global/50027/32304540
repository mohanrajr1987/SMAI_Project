<p>I am developing a Xamarin form application. I want to create a custom progress bar. A slider which increments it's according to the progress. Initially the slider value should be minimum and should increment it's value according to the progress. When the task is finished the slider should have maximum value. How can I achieve this? is there any windows phone custom progress bar like this? please help me?</p>
