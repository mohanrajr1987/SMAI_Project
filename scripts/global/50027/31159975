<p>I am developing a WP8 application where i need to post some tweets. The tweet should contain text and image url where the image should be automatically loaded from the image url. </p>  <p>Right now I can able to share only the text. I dont find any thing to share the image url as well. </p>  <pre><code>var restRequest = new RestRequest             {                 Credentials = credentials,                 Path = "/1.1/statuses/update.json",                 Method = WebMethod.Post             };              restRequest.AddParameter("status", "test4");             restClient.BeginRequest(restRequest, new RestCallback(PostTweetRequestCallback)); </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions will be appreciated. </p>
