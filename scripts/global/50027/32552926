<p>Good day<br> I recently downloaded <i>Visual Studio 2013 Update 5</i>, and then realized that I needed Hyper-V to run the emulator. I can't afford to upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro right now, so which version of visual studio would I have to install on my computer to be able to develop for windows phone 7 without Hyper-V.<br> And would I still be able to get it?(<i>Visual Studio 2013 Update 5</i> is the earliest version I'm seeing for download on the VS website) <br><br> Thanks in advance for any help</p>
