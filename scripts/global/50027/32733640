<p>Have to create a ListBox or similar control with expandable items for WP8 SL:</p>  <ul> <li>Only one item can be expanded at the same time</li> <li>Animation should apply on expanding of the item</li> <li>Animation should apply on collapsing of the item</li> <li>Animation of a new selected item should start only after the collapsing animation of the previous item</li> <li>Collapsed area should have it's own MouseOver state (Highlighting)</li> </ul>  <p>I tried to use <a href="https://phone.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Toolkit</a> and <a href="http://bewisephonecontrols.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Bewise Phone Controls</a> for the expandable items. In first case the ExpanderView is holding a collection in second case it looked perfect for our case.</p>  <p>Now about the control that is going to represent the collection of expandable items on the screen. I tried to use ListBox but it's impossible to "unselect" an item if the selection mode is set to Single. Decided to go with ItemsControl. </p>  <p>Current problem is Animations, all examples that I found deal only with scaling and rotating, but I have to use slide down animation which will incrementally increase the size of the parent (to move down the other elements).</p>  <p>Maybe someone solved this kind of problem in the past and can share the experience with me.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>  <p>P.S.: The code sample is quite long, however if needed I could post part of it.</p>
