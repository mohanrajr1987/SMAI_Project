<p>I am developing a app for windows Phone having div's fixed as header and footer. In middle div with content overflow: auto is given for scrolling but the scroll in windows appears very jerky while doing touch movements. iscroll.js has also applied in content area but the scroll is again very jerky.  I have tried various solutions on net but couldn't find the solution. How to overcome this windows overflow issue either with css or with J'S? </p>
