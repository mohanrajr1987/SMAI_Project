<p>I have an App targeted for <code>WP7</code> and the <code>push notification</code> which triggers <code>sqlite</code> code to insert messages into <code>sqlite DB</code>. This works fine when the App is in the foreground, but not work when App is the background.</p>  <p>What is the best approach to take so that when user received <code>push notification</code>, it can execute <code>sqlite</code> code in the background?</p>  <p>I read up on <code>background agent</code>, but wasn't sure how <code>background agent</code> can receive data from <code>push notification</code>. </p>  <p>Any example or idea will be very helpful.</p>
