<p>I am building a music app in windows phone 8.1 silverlight. I used medialibrary and songcollection to access music library in device. I also use mediaplayer to play/pause/next/ song. But I want to use slider to change positon of active song but I have no idea to solve it. Please help me, thanks a lot!</p>  <pre><code>private void changed_possition(object sender, System.Windows.Input.ManipulationCompletedEventArgs e)//slider event      {         if (MediaPlayer.State== MediaState.Playing)         {             TimeSpan ts = new TimeSpan(0, 0, (int)music_slider.Value);             MediaPlayer.Queue.ActiveSong.Duration = ts;         }      } </code></pre>  <p>I try use this code but it doesn't work.</p>
