<p>I'm building my first PhoneGap app and I have problem with WP 7 WebBrowser encoding. It doesn't correctly display Armenian symbols. My index.html is encoded in UTF-8 (Notepad++: Encoding -> Convert to UTF-8), <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /&gt;</code> presents, in Assembly Information... I changed Neutral Language to Armenian, also I tried to replace all Armenian symbols with their HTML encoded equivalent (e.t.c &amp;#****;) but the result is <a href="http://tinypic.com/r/mi1mvo/8" rel="nofollow">shown in this screenshot.</a></p>  <p>I tried different PhoneGap versions (1.5.0 and 2.5.0) but without any positive changes. And one more thing. Greek and Russian (for example, I tried those two) symbols are encoded correctly.</p>  <p>Some technical information: Desktop OS: Windows 7 x32, Mobile OS: Windows Phone 7.8 (7.10.8862.144), Development Environment: MVS 2010 for Windows Phone + Windows Phone SDK for 7.8 update.</p>
