<p>I am trying to write a qr code onto a bitmap image however its seems like SetPixel wont work at all, I don't know whether its a refrence am missing however is the code</p>  <pre><code>    WriteableBitmap wbmi = new    System.Windows.Media.Imaging.WriteableBitmap(width, height);  for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) {     for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) {     int grayValue = bMatrix.Array[y][x] &amp; 0xff;     if (grayValue == 0)                                 wbmi.SetPixel(x, y, Color.FromArgb(255, 0, 0,0));                                                          else          wbmi.SetPixel(x, y, Color.FromArgb(255, 255, 255, 255));  }  }  image1.Source = wbmi; </code></pre>  <p>I really need help on this or an equivalent in windows phone 7</p>
