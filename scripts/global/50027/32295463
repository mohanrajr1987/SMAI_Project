<p>I have in my wp8 app two longlistselectors and I got them scroll togheter using the instruction I found in Shawn Kendrot answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20999565/bind-tie-scroll-position-of-two-longlistselectors?answertab=votes#tab-top">here</a>. But now I need to activate and deactivate the joint by a button, so I tried to write the binding in code:</p>  <pre><code>Binding b=new Binding("ScrollPosition"); b.Source = verseList1; //b.Path = new  PropertyPath(SynchedLongListSelector.ViewPortProperty); //b.Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay; verseList2.SetBinding(SynchedLongListSelector.ViewPortProperty, b); </code></pre>  <p>Nothing happened, and if I un-comment the lines 3 and 4, a got a catastrophic error.</p>  <p>Someone can help me?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
