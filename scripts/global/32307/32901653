<p>I am trying to import ckChangeLog as a gradle project in Eclipse. I have Eclipse Mars and build tool 23.0.1 Android API is installed and is clearly available for other projects. Following is the error</p>  <p>FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.</p>  <ul> <li>Where: Script 'C:\ckChangeLog-master (2)\ckChangeLog-</li> </ul>  <p>master\android-mvn-push.gradle' line: 57</p>  <ul> <li><p>What went wrong: A problem occurred configuring project ':ckChangeLog'.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>failed to find target android-21 : C:\Android SDK ADT Bundle - Windows 64 Bits</p> </blockquote></li> <li><p>Try: Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
