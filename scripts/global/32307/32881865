<p>I just downloaded and installed the latest version of android studio (v 1.4). After creating a new project, I see this error about the gradle refresh failure:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: Could not create an instance of Tooling API implementation using the specified Gradle installation '/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/gradle/gradle-2.4'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've tried so many different things that I have found online and no fix. When I open the layout window of the project it says "Gradle project sync failed..."</p>  <p>I am not sure what the error means at all and also do not know how to use any other different version of it.</p>
