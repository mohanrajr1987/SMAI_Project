<p>I have included below libraries to my app's lib folder:</p>  <ol> <li>compile files('libs/retrofit-2.0.0-beta2.jar')</li> <li>compile files('libs/converter-gson-2.0.0-beta1.jar')</li> </ol>  <p>When going to run app it gives me such an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error:(17, 17) error: cannot access HttpUrl class file for   com.squareup.okhttp.HttpUrl not found</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have created app including retrofit as said here: <a href="http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/retrofit-2.0/en" rel="nofollow">The biggest update yet on the best HTTP Client Library for Android</a></p>  <ol> <li><p>As there said: But in Retrofit 2.0, OkHttp is now required and is automatically set as a dependency. </p>  <p>-- So, did not add OkHttp to my project</p></li> <li><p>As there said: But in Retrofit 2.0, Converter is not included in the package anymore. You need to plug a Converter in yourself or Retrofit will be able to accept only the String result. As a result, Retrofit 2.0 doesn't depend on Gson anymore. </p>  <p>-- So, i decided include <strong>Gson: com.squareup.retrofit:converter-gson</strong> to my app, not <strong>'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.3.1'</strong></p></li> </ol>  <p>Any advises how to use retrofit will be helpful. And please advice me how to correct this main Error?</p>  <p><strong>Solved:</strong> I searched and find this solution. If you are using proxy to connect internet then simply add it to gradle.properties file:</p>  <p>systemProp.http.proxyHost=xxx systemProp.http.proxyPort=xxx systemProp.http.proxyUser=xxx systemProp.http.proxyPassword=xxx systemProp.http.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost</p>  <p>systemProp.https.proxyHost=xxx systemProp.https.proxyPort=xxx systemProp.https.proxyUser=xxx systemProp.https.proxyPassword=xxx systemProp.https.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost</p>  <p>Thanks to @ilya. It was just network issue</p>
