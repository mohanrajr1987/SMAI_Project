<p>We use <strong>clover</strong> for code coverage testing but it interferes with stack traces and error information. I want to be able to use <code>cloverGenerateReport</code> when doing automated builds via <strong>jenkins</strong> but to skip this step <em>entirely</em> when doing local builds.</p>  <p>I've tried the various suggestions from searches for 'gradle optional dependencies' but I can't seem to get <strong>clover</strong> completely out of the way.</p>  <p>Suggestions?</p>
