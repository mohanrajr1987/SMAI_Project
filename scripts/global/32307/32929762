<p>I have PMD and FindBugs configured in eclipse as well as Gradle. The Gradle reports are consumed by Jenkins, which lists a set of violations, which seem to be different than those reported by Eclipse.</p>  <p>I would like to set my Eclipse FindBugs and PMD settings to be the same as the defaults for the corresponding Gradle Plugins.</p>  <p>What are the default PMD RuleSets and FindBugs effort configured for the Gradle Plugins ?</p>
