<p>I work with Gradle plus the Java plugin and I run the following tests:</p>  <pre><code>@Test     public void testBufferedReader() throws URISyntaxException {          File newFile = new File(PersonDataProcessor.class.getResource("DataCSVerrors.txt")                 .toURI());          BufferedReader br;         try {             br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(newFile));             String line = null;             while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {                 System.out.println(line);             }         } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {             // TODO Auto-generated catch block             e.printStackTrace();         } catch (IOException e) {             // TODO Auto-generated catch block             e.printStackTrace();         }     }      @Test     public void testScanner() throws URISyntaxException {          File newFile = new File(PersonDataProcessor.class.getResource("DataCSVerrors.txt")                 .toURI());          Scanner br;         try {             br = new Scanner(newFile);             while(br.hasNextLine()) {                 System.out.println(br.nextLine());             }         } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {             // TODO Auto-generated catch block             e.printStackTrace();         }      } </code></pre>  <p>In both tests the File is found without any problem. What I really don't get is the difference between the BufferedReader and the Scanner here, because while the BufferedReader works totally properly, the file reading with the Scanner doesn't work at all. The program does not enter the while loop.. </p>  <p>Actual there shouldn't be a difference between the two, should it? What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>  <p><strong>ANNOTATION:</strong></p>  <p><strong>I found out the following:</strong> <strong>The file I use was created on a Windows PC. I use a Mac. With a file I created by myself on my machine it works.</strong></p>
