<p>In my app the user can send email when the app has crashed. But I do only see a shorten stacktrace (without linenumber) e.g.</p>  <pre><code>at com.bla.blub.activities.ai.onItemSelected(Unknown Source) at android.widget.AdapterView.fireOnSelected(AdapterView.java:895) at android.widget.AdapterView.selectionChanged(AdapterView.java:882) </code></pre>  <p>Of course this means the build was build without debug symbols.</p>  <p>But how can enable the line number and full classname when I build the relase? I mean is there any gradle flag, that I can use ? When I build a bormal debug app (buildTypes=debug), google play store telling me that they do not accept this kind of build</p>  <p>Thanks for helping</p>
