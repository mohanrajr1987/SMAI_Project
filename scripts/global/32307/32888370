<p>I am using Jenkins with gradle build on windows system. Jenkins is internally using maven.I have folder structure as blow C:\users\.m2\repository\\ Inside the modulename folder I have multiple folder with version as below 1.0.1 1.0.2 ... 1.0.50. Can anybody let me know why we have these folders created each day. Is it a good idea to discard or reduce the folder.if yes how we can achieve this.</p>
