<p>I have successfully modified my build.gradle to work with gradle-experimental however when trying to add a signingConfigs block it fails.  I followed the instructions from <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental" rel="nofollow">http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental</a> as best I can but i always get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.</p>      <blockquote>     <p>The following model rules are unbound:         model.android.signingConfigs > named(release)           Mutable:             - android.signingConfigs.release (com.android.build.gradle.managed.SigningConfig)</p>   </blockquote> </blockquote>  <p>I search for the error but couldn't find anything relevant.  What does "The following model rules are unbound" mean?</p>  <p>Here's what my signingConfig block looks like, it's outside the android block and modified to use = as is the case when using gradle-experimental.</p>  <pre><code>android.signingConfigs {     release {         storeFile = file("myreleasekey.keystore")         storePassword = "password"         keyAlias = "MyReleaseKey"         keyPassword = "password"     } } </code></pre>
