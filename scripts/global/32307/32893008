<p>Hi I am working on a project and have reached a stage where it would be unwise to continue without unit testing. I thought unit testing in Android Studio would be straight forward but I can't run my tests.</p>  <p>Here are my dependencies. Everything works fine until I add the last line of code. I then receive the error message that is in the title.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WpnLH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WpnLH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>How do I fix this and run my tests? </p>  <p>Here was the tutorial I was following: <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support" rel="nofollow">http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support</a></p>
