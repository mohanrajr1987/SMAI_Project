<p>Very weird bug appears in my Cordova project when I updated Cordova and Android SDK (all are in the last versions).</p>  <p>Since the update I got the following error with gradle : Error: more than one library with package name 'com.google.android.gms'</p>  <p>Cordova plugins have not changed and this was working well before the update. Removing/adding the Android platform or cleaning it doesn't fix this error.</p>  <p>It seems due to the version 8.1 of com.google.android.gms</p>  <p>I use the cordova-plugin-google-analytics which uses :  com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:+ (I assume the + means last version?)  Due to this line and with the update the project don't build anymore Replacing the + with a value (7.5.0, etc for example) works well </p>  <p>Does 8.x has a breaking change? </p>  <p>I saw this post too: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=187464" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=187464</a></p>  <p>For now I will force a value but if you have a better solution you are welcome </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
