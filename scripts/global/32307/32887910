<p>I know this is a widely discussed argument, but even if I applied every single tip found on the web I'm still not satisfied of gradle build time: on a project with 3 modules and a bounch of libraries it takes about 1 minute to build, even if I change just one line of code. Most of the time is taken by the task dexDebug (about 50 seconds)</p>  <p>Here is what I did:</p>  <p>on app's build.gradle file is</p>  <pre><code>dexOptions {     incremental true     javaMaxHeapSize "4g"     preDexLibraries = false } </code></pre>  <ul> <li>parallel build and daemon enabled in the IDE  </li> <li>under .gradle folder I created the file gradle.properties with this parameters</li> </ul>  <blockquote>   <p>GRADLE_OPTS="-Xmx2048m -Xms1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=4096m   -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError" gradle grails-run-app</p> </blockquote>  <ul> <li>the jvm has -Xmx2048m -Xms1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=4096m </li> </ul>  <p>Everything is running on a macbook pro with intel core i7, 16gb of ram and SSD disk, with the last android studio release and gradle 2.4</p>  <p>is that normal or is there something I'm missing???</p>  <p>many thanks for any help</p>
