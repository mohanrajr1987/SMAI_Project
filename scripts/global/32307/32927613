<p>I have a Folder Structure like this</p>  <pre><code>/A/B/MyAndroidApp/ /ExoPlayer </code></pre>  <p>and I have sucessfully compiled ExoPlayer (using gradle) but whatever I try I cannot get the exoplayer library referenced in the MyAndroidApp. I don't really care either whether I reference the whole library project or just the jar.</p>  <p>I have tried: adjusting the gradle scripts to include the external project, copying the library to the local folder structure, adding the ExoPlayer Project as a Module to the MyAndroidApp module, whatever I do, it will either throw errors when compiling or won't find the library package.</p>  <p>I am very new to gradle and very confused by the concept. I used to just work with the IntelliJ settings to configure dependencies. I don't even know if gradle and the intelliJ settings are compatible.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
