<p>I am working on an Android library (aar) project. The project contains a README.md file which in turn contains these lines:</p>  <pre><code>   ... declare library dependency:     Gradle: `compile 'com.acme:mylibrary:1.0.0@aar'` </code></pre>  <p>My <code>gradle.properties</code> file contains:</p>  <p><code>VERSION_NAME=1.0.0</code></p>  <p>The problem is that currently I have to keep two files manually in sync. What I would like to do is keep the <code>VERSION_NAME</code> property and substitute it's value into <code>README.md</code></p>
