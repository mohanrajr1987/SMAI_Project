<p>I was trying to integrate v1.4.0-beta1 of the android gradle plugin in my app when I hit the following exception:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>java.lang.IllegalStateException: Task with type   com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.AndroidReportTask_Decorated   does not include a variantName 00:20:36.904 [ERROR]   [org.gradle.BuildExceptionReporter]        at   com.android.build.gradle.internal.profile.RecordingBuildListener.afterExecute(RecordingBuildListener.java:90)   00:20:36.904 [ERROR] [org.gradle.BuildExceptionReporter]        at   sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor410.invoke(Unknown Source)   00:20:36.904 [ERROR] [org.gradle.BuildExceptionReporter]        at   sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)</p> </blockquote>  <p>This issue seems to be related with the android-reporting plugin. Our build server runs the following command:</p>  <pre><code>clean check connectedCheck mergeAndroidReports assembleRelease </code></pre>  <p>This works perfectly fine in pre 1.4.x versions. All I could find was <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/36f28e8%5E!/" rel="nofollow">this</a> changeset, but it was not very helpful. Currently, our app has 2 different build types (debug, release) and 2 product flavors (flavor1, flavor2).</p>  <p>Does anyone have any ideas on what might be going on?</p>
