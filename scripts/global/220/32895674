<p>I have a password protected excel file that I need to use in a macro, but I am afraid that the password will change from month to month. In order to access the file, I would like to create a user form to enter the password each time the macro is run. Here are my objectives for this sub:</p>  <ol> <li>Select the file to open</li> <li>Enter the password in a user form (If the file is protected)</li> <li>Open the file using the selected path and password.</li> </ol>  <p>I can complete steps 1 and 3 on their own, but I am not sure how to incorporate the user form into this sub. How would you solve this problem?</p>
