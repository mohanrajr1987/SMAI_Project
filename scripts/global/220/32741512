<p>In C# code, I have an app that uses the WinSCP API. (it isn't important if is WinSCP or whatever).</p>  <p>To open a session, I need a user and a password; since that user/password is not introduced by any external user, it is directly taken from a config file like app.config and inserted directly by code, I need a way to store it securely in the config file.</p>  <p>I've used this hash generator: <a href="http://www.danstools.com/md5-hash-generator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.danstools.com/md5-hash-generator/</a> to generate a MD5 hash string from my password string and it is stored at the app.config file.</p>  <p>So my question is: how can I get the original password from the "hash" string?</p>  <p>Just in case:</p>  <p>If it is not the proper way to implement what I need, please show me the good way to securely store a password and when needed, get back the original password to use it in code.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
