<p>there is very simple question - can you normalize for me some password, because I can't understand how it works? So, there is password: "IDoMdGuFE9S0", how it looks in "normalized" view? There are only alphanumeric ascii characters. Does result and original be equal?</p>  <p>PS: Sorry for my bad English.</p>
