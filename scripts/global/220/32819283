<p>I use google chrome since quite some time as one of my main browsers. So far, when I saved my passwords in chrome they were added to my keychain in OSX. Somehow this is not the case anymore. I have the Option ticked in the chromes settings, where it says that it can save passwords (it even indicates, that chrome may save it to keychain on macs), but they are only saved to the internal password manager in chrome. (chrome://settings/passwords)</p>  <p>Did anyone experience the same behaviour? I really would like to have them saved in my keychain again.</p>  <p>Thanks for any hints on that matter.</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
