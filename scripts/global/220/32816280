<p>I want to execute a bash script which remotely changes the postgresql's user's password with the new one specified. I have already written a bash script which can change the user password locally on the same machine. The command that I used was:</p>  <pre><code>sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d postgres -p 5433 -c "alter user test with password 'newpass';" </code></pre>  <p>This is working fine for localhost connecting to the cluster on port 5433. However I want to execute the bash on one EC2 instance whereas the postgresql cluster is located on another ec2 instance i.e., remote</p>  <p>I tried using this from my Linux instance</p>  <pre><code>sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d postgres -h hostname -p 5433 -c "alter user test with password 'newpass';" </code></pre>  <p>It gives me the error saying </p>  <blockquote>   <p>unknown user: postgres</p> </blockquote>  <p>The error is self-explanatory saying it cannot find the user postgres and hence cannot login on that machine. But then what would be the correct syntax to change the pass remotely</p>
