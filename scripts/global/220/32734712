<p>My question is little special to my situation. I have done some research but maybe i'm doing some errors. I want to change user (not admin) password in C# and i want to change the password 's indication (text to remenber password) in the same time. All that in C#. I have write codes that works when i'm in admin account but not in user account, i don't know why.  That is my code :</p>  <pre><code>//conversion password to secure password start string password = "admin"; System.Security.SecureString sec_pass = new System.Security.SecureString(); Array.ForEach(password.ToArray(), sec_pass.AppendChar); sec_pass.MakeReadOnly();  //End of conversion   System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo psi = new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo(); psi.Verb = "runas"; psi.FileName = "cmd.exe"; psi.UseShellExecute = false; psi.Password = sec_pass; psi.Arguments = "/C net user Utilisateur new"; System.Diagnostics.Process p = new System.Diagnostics.Process(); p.StartInfo = psi; p.Start(); </code></pre>  <p>My user is called Utilisateur and my admin password is admin</p>  <p>In this code i just try to change password, but that does not work. and i don't know how to change the indication text. If some one may help me go throw.</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
