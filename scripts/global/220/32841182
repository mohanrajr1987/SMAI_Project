<p>I created a contact form and have a security question for this form.</p>  <p>I did some research for my question already, but I want to double-check before I make any mistakes...</p>  <p>Basically, I created my contact form in my code behind as follows. </p>  <p>In there, I would have to include my Email address and my password to get connected to the smtp server.</p>  <p>I am afraid it's easy to find out my credentials.</p>  <p>Does anybody have a recommendation for how to secure this code? (Or am I dead wrong with this solution anyways?)</p>  <pre><code>Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)  End Sub Protected Sub Button_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)     Try         If Page.IsValid Then             Dim mailMessage As New MailMessage()             mailMessage.From = New MailAddress("MYEMAILADRESS")             mailMessage.To.Add("MYEMAILADRESS")             mailMessage.Subject = txtSubject.Text              mailMessage.Body = "&lt;b&gt;Sender Name : &lt;/b&gt;" &amp; txtName.Text &amp; "&lt;br/&gt;" &amp; "&lt;b&gt;Sender Email : &lt;/b&gt;" &amp; txtEmail.Text &amp; "&lt;br/&gt;" &amp; "&lt;b&gt;Phone &lt;/b&gt;" &amp; txtPhone.Text &amp; "&lt;br/&gt;" &amp; "&lt;b&gt;Comments : &lt;/b&gt;" &amp; txtComments.Text              mailMessage.IsBodyHtml = True               Dim smtpClient As New SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com", 587)             smtpClient.EnableSsl = True             smtpClient.Credentials = New System.Net.NetworkCredential("MYEMAILADRESS", "PASSWORD")             smtpClient.Send(mailMessage)              Label.Text = "Thank you for contacting us"              txtName.Enabled = False             txtEmail.Enabled = False             txtComments.Enabled = False             txtSubject.Enabled = False             txtPhone.Enabled = False             Button.Enabled = False         End If     Catch ex As Exception         'Log - Event Viewer or table         Label.Text = "There is an unknown problem, please try later"     End Try End Sub </code></pre>
