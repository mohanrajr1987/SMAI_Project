<p>I've read that for security purposes, it is a good idea to have the same flash message whether or not the user exists when someone submits an email for forgot password.</p>  <p>How do I achieve this with devise?</p>  <p>I was looking at the create action of the passwords controller but I can't figure out how to change it.</p>  <p>Here is the action:</p>  <pre><code>def create     self.resource = resource_class.send_reset_password_instructions(resource_params)     yield resource if block_given?      if successfully_sent?(resource)       respond_with({}, location: after_sending_reset_password_instructions_path_for(resource_name))     else       respond_with(resource)     end   end </code></pre>  <p>I think I would also need to make it so this bypasses validations so error messages are not generated.  Is this even possible with devise?</p>
