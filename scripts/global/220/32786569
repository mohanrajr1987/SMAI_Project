<p>Salesforce.com's client IDs are over 80 alphanumeric characters with an underscore. Their client secrets are 20 numbers or less.</p>  <p>Google's client IDs are over 40 characters, their client secrets are 24 characters or so. </p>  <p>According to the Oauth spec, the client id is not meant to be kept secret, so you'd have to assume it is as public as a username. </p>  <p>My question is, shouldn't the client secrets be longer so they're harder to guess vs. the ids? Especially with the client_credentials grant type, which only requires a client id and secret - wouldn't shorter client secrets with known character sets make it much easier to perform brute force attacks if someone got a hold of a client id, or am I missing something here?</p>  <p>Note, I understand that in a real production scenario, you could mitigate this risk in quite a few ways - requiring multi factor authentication, or disabling accounts after too many invalid attempts for example. Is there some logic I'm missing as to why these implementations of OAuth haven't made their client secrets longer?</p>
