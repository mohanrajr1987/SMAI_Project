<p>I'm trying to change the wordpress admin password(I lost the password and can't access the email), but currently I could access the phpmyadmin, I want to change the admin password through db, but I don't know which kind of encryption the back-end used.Could anyone help me figure it out? Or is there any other way to change the admin password through db? I can't post images, the password likes "$P$BOZMgyp.M.2Zy1zj3R7WFrJfc/nQPG1" or "$P$BPsJKQdT99XsX/C5PfHg4w4QMEVvS40" after encryption. It looks like it always start with "$P$B" sth. Thanks</p>
