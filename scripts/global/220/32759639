<p>I'm writing a Windows Forms application in C# in which users have to connect to a SQL Server database. The potential users receive randomly built passwords from the customer and the customers policy enforces that users are required to change the password (SQL Server - option MUST_CHANGE).</p>  <p>I'm having difficulties in providing a function which allows the users to change the given password on their first attempt to login: every attempt to connect to SQL Server with the provided credentials leads to a <code>SqlException</code> with error number 18488 stating that the user has to change the password - which is exactly what I'm trying to do.</p>  <p>I've tried to use:</p>  <ol> <li><p>an <code>ALTER LOGIN</code> statement as a <code>SqlCommand</code></p>  <pre><code>ALTER LOGIN 'someLogin' WITH PASSWORD = 'newPassword', OLD_PASSWORD = 'oldPassword' </code></pre></li> <li><p>a <code>ServerConnection</code> with a <code>Server</code> and <code>Login</code> object issuing a  <code>ChangePassword(oldPassword, newPassword)</code> request</p>  <pre><code>var serverConnection = new ServerConnection(someSQlConnection); serverConnection.Connect();  var server = new Server(serverConnection);  var login = new Login(server, 'someLogin') { LoginType =  LoginType.SqlLogin }; login.ChangePassword(oldPassword, newPassword); </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>The Problem is that already the attempt to connect to the SQL Server fails, the password changing query doesn't even get executed.Anybody can provide a hint how to solve this issue ?</p>
