<p>I have set up an ssh key for my work, and have used it a couple times. Then, all of the sudden, when I attempt "git push" instead of working it lags for a second then a pop up appears saying:</p>  <p>"Enter your password for the SSH key "id_rsa". </p>  <p>I did NOT set up a password for my usual ssh key. Any advice on how to get it working again?</p>
