<p>I have the following curl command which works perfectly fine:</p>  <pre><code>curl --silent --location -cookie "$COOKIE" --cookie-jar "$COOKIE" \ --form 'username=xxx' --form 'password=yyy' 'http://example.com' </code></pre>  <p>It logs into site <a href="http://example.com" rel="nofollow">http://example.com</a> posting a form with variable names username and password.</p>  <p>Problem is: I do not want to pass the password in clear.</p>  <p>I have also tried to save the password in a file called passwd in the working directory (chmod 600 passwd) and used the following curl command (this is why I used --form instead of --data, which would have been worked fine with the password in clear), however, it does not work:</p>  <pre><code>curl --silent --location -cookie "$COOKIE" --cookie-jar "$COOKIE" \ --form 'username=xxx' --form 'password=&lt;passwd' 'http://example.com' </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestion about how to solve this?</p>  <p>Regards, Stefano</p>
