<p>I run a localhost server for MySQL and PHP, in the phpMyAdmin I get the message on pink background:</p>  <p>"Your configuration file contains settings (root with no password) that correspond to the MySQL privileged default account. Your MySQL server is running with this default, is open to intrusion, and you really should fix this security hole by setting a password for user 'root'."</p>  <p>Can anybody please tell me about the risks? Are there any? Like what?</p>  <p>Best regards</p>
