<p>two salts will be sent to the user. The one generated on registration stored in the database and a salt used one time generated during sign in. The user will send the password hashed with both salts (stored one first) to the server. The sever will hash the stored hash( one built from hasing password with stored salt) with the challenge salt and compare the two. This is the diagram... <a href="http://postimg.org/image/9j92u4knp/" rel="nofollow">http://postimg.org/image/9j92u4knp/</a></p>  <p>Does this work well and how can I improve this. I was thinking for hashing the password with the salt I would use  PBKDF2 and for hashing the first hash with the challenge I would use sha-256</p>
