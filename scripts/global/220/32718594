<p>I drive into the following problem that I am not able to clear a password field via the AppiumDriver (AndroidDriver). The 'clear()' command does not clear the field and then the new text will be set in front of the old one. </p>  <p>Strange is also the clear behavior of a simple text field (appium log):</p>  <ol> <li>Clearing text not successful. Attempting to clear by selecting all and deleting. </li> <li>Clearing text not successful. Attempting to clear by sending delete keys.</li> </ol>  <p>After that the text was really cleared.</p>  <p>Back to the password field. Could be the problem that Appium is not able to see any charakters in the password field and then act as if the field is not filled?</p>  <p>I found some workaround here in other posts to mark the entire field and send a delete command, but AppiumDriver itself does not support the command sendKeyEvent(). So this will not work for me.</p>  <p>Used: Appium 1.4.8, appium java-client 3.0.0</p>
