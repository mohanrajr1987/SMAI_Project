<p>I need the user to input their password into my script so that I can then use that password to perform an LDAP operation on their account.  It's very simple:</p>  <pre><code>password = getpass.getpass()     ldapconn.simple_bind_s(binddn, password) </code></pre>  <p>Even though the password is never leaving the script and is never displayed in plain text, isn't it still vulnerable to something like a memory dump?  What's the best way to secure this password within the script, but still make use of it?</p>  <p>This post is interesting: <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29019/are-passwords-stored-in-memory-safe">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29019/are-passwords-stored-in-memory-safe</a></p>  <p>Primarily because the answers confirm my suspicion that passwords stored in RAM are not safe.  My question is, how is one supposed to do work that requires that sensitive information be stored in RAM?  No one on that post really posts a practical real-world solution, just a lot of a confirmation and details as to why RAM is not safe.  Using my short example of an LDAP connection above, what concrete changes could you make to better secure the password variable?</p>
