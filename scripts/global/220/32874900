<p>I'm new to python and I'm having a problem. I need to check a password on its upper, lower, numbers and symbols. It needs 1 of each class and the whole password needs to be longer then 6 characters. I have upper and lower case so far. <code>raw_input</code> inputs as a string so how can I then check for numbers and symbols in that string?</p>  <p>My code so far:</p>  <pre><code>p = raw_input(("plz enter a password to check it's strength"))  if len (p) &lt;= 6:     if p.isupper() or p.islower() or int(p):         print"This is a weak password  " elif len(p) &gt; 6 and len(p)  &lt;26:     if p.isupper() or p.islower() or isdigit():         print "wea2k"     else:         print "good" </code></pre>  <p>So what I need to know is how to check the input for numbers and symbols.</p>
