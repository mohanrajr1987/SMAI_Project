<p>So I have a question for homework in my secure programming and testing class. The question is considering Windows NT or UNIX shell account.  "How many bits of information are possible in an eight-character password if any character can be used?" So the way I see it there are 95 possible characters on a standard keyboard. but doesn't it depend on the encoding as to how many "bits of information" are in a single character?  I'm not asking for the answer, I just need help understanding the bit-character part, and then I can figure out the math on my own.</p>
