<p>I have a DataTable, dt, that I am attempting to convert to an observable collection. <strong>I have included the reference to System.Data.DataSetExtensions.</strong>  I am first converting the dt to to a DataView so that I can sort the data. I then convert back to a table. After I try to convert to IEnumerable. When I do this I get the error: <strong>Error  CS1929  'DataTable' does not contain a definition for 'AsEnumerable'</strong></p>  <p>Below is what I am trying. I am sure that I am missing something basic here. Again, I have double checkded the references. I have even removed and added the references back in again as my searches so far have indicated that this is the primary problem with this. </p>  <pre><code>DataTable dt = GetData(); DataView dv = dt.DefaultView; dv.Sort = "URLId desc"; //URLId is Column1 dt = dv.ToTable(); IEnumerable&lt;MyClass&gt; items = dt.AsEnumerable&lt;MyClass&gt;();  //Error occurs here IList&lt;MyClass&gt; myItems = new ObservableCollection&lt;MyClass&gt;(items); </code></pre>  <p>MyClass is a simple collection of string and date fields. Below is the constructor for the class. </p>  <pre><code>public MyClass(string urlId, string urlAddress, string displayName) {     URLId = urlId;     CommonName = displayName;     URLAddress = urlAddress;     DateLastTouched = DateTime.Now;     Preview = urlAddress;     Publish = false;                           } </code></pre>
