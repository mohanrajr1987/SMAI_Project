<p>I want to have multiple sort on datatable. I find below link that seems more match on my case. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15199805/initial-sortorder-for-primeface-datatable-with-multisort">Initial sortorder for Primeface datatable with multisort</a>  But I have one field that have specified sorting. I have only three different values. e.g. TCS(first in sorting), School-input (second), self-input (third). Their sorting are not on letters as you see. How to handle this?? Do you have any suggestions to help me??</p>
