<p>I have an application with a huge DataTable (as in large number of columns) that is receiving high frequency updates and is currently running too slowly. My profiling shows a disproportionate amount of time is being spent on the BeginEdit and EndEdit calls on the DataRows. I understand these calls are slow because BeginEdit involves checkpointing the DataRow in case the changes are cancelled, and EndEdit triggers validation. </p>  <p>Given I'm happy to exchange transactionality and validation for performance, is there any way to disable either or both? Or is my only bet to "roll my own"?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
