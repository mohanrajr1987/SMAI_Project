<p>I have a datatable which has 3 columns "Name","Type","ID" i want to use only one column in it for comparison. Which is "Type". I wanted to take that column put it in a DataColumn separated from the datatable, compare the values of the cells in it with a string and then pass a string if it matches. I am not sure if this method is right or wrong, i even dont know how to get the string value of the cells (rows) in this Datacolumn to be compared</p>  <p>Here is my code for it :</p>  <pre><code>DataTable Griddetails; Griddetails = RxMUaClient.BrowseGrid("2", "127.0.0.1:48030", nodepassed);  var myColumn = Griddetails.Columns.Cast&lt;DataColumn&gt;()                           .SingleOrDefault(col =&gt; col.ColumnName == "Type");  return Json(myColumn); if (myColumn != null) {     for (int i = 0; i &lt;= myColumn.; i++ )     {      } } </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to get the datarow count in the dataColumn either by a for loop or foreach, the foreach is not working for some error and the i don't know how to get the value of the datacolumn for the for loop.</p>  <p>Any help ?</p>
