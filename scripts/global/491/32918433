<p>I am trying to get the user selected rowsPerPage in the primefaces datatable. I have looked at the post here and tried: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7413662/how-to-update-other-components-when-rowsperpage-or-page-changes-in-pdatatable">How to update other components when rowsPerPage or page changes in &lt;p:dataTable&gt;</a> but it gives me the previous reading. </p>  <p>E.g. when page is at 10 rows per page, user clicks 5 rows per page and the logger printout is at 10. Only the next change it displays 5. The bean i am using is at ViewScoped, i am not sure if this will affect.</p>
