<p>I'm new to VB.NET. I got some data inside a text file and i wanna load these data into datatable so that i can export it to .csv file. As i know, there are 3 steps to do it: 1 read file to datatable 2 populate DGV with the DataTable 3 export the DGV to a CSV file or directly to an excel .xls or xlsx file</p>  <p>I have the source code but it doesn't work for my program. It gives me an error saying "Cannot find column 1".  Your help is much appreciated, Thanks in advance!</p>  <pre><code>  Dim myTable As DataTable = New DataTable("MyTable")     Dim i As Integer     Dim myRow As DataRow     Dim fieldValues As String()     Dim f As IO.File     Dim myReader As IO.StreamReader      Try         myReader = File.OpenText(fileFullPath)         fieldValues = myReader.ReadLine().Split("#")          For i = 0 To fieldValues.Length() - 1             myTable.Columns.Add(New DataColumn("Field" &amp; i))         Next         myRow = myTable.NewRow          For i = 0 To fieldValues.Length() - 1             myRow.Item(i) = fieldValues(i).ToString         Next         myTable.Rows.Add(myRow)          While myReader.Peek &lt;&gt; -1             fieldValues = myReader.ReadLine().Split(" ")             myRow = myTable.NewRow              For i = 0 To fieldValues.Length() - 1                 myRow.Item(i) = fieldValues(i).ToString             Next             myTable.Rows.Add(myRow)         End While      Catch ex As Exception         MsgBox("Error building datatable:" &amp; ex.Message)         Return New DataTable("Empty")     Finally         myReader.Close()     End Try      Return myTable </code></pre>
