<p>I'm trying to map the following DataModel to a SQL database. The structure (currently) is hierarchical in nature, with some properties being DataTables as well. The hierarchical structure is handled great using Entity Framework code first, but I'm having a very hard time mapping the DataTable properties. The model looks as follows (specific focus on "InformationTable" in Employee class):</p>  <pre><code>    public class Employee {     public Employee()     {      }      public int EmployeeID { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }      public List&lt;SubEmployee&gt; Employees { get; set; }      public DataTable InformationTable { get; set; } }      public class SubEmployee {     public SubEmployee()     {      }      public int SubEmployeeID { get; set; }      public string Name { get; set; }      public List&lt;SubEmployee&gt; SubEmployees { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to map something like this to a SQL database, and if so, how can I go about doing it?</p>
