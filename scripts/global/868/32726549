<p>When running <code>gwt:compile</code> my application is throwing this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[INFO]    at com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler.main(Compiler.java:127) [INFO]    [ERROR] Could not find   org.jboss.errai.bus.client.framework.RpcProxyLoaderImpl in types   compiled from source. Is the source glob too strict? [INFO]    [ERROR]   Errors in   'org/jboss/errai/bus/client/framework/ClientMessageBusImpl.java'   [INFO]       [ERROR] Line 985: Rebind result   'org.jboss.errai.bus.client.framework.RpcProxyLoaderImpl' could not be   found</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can't seem to find the root cause of this error, what could be causing this? And what is this "Is the source glob too strict?"</p>  <p>Using maven and GWT 2.7.0</p>
