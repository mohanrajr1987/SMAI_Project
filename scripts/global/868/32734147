<p>I have a GWT project and its BasePageURL is <a href="http://localhost:1010/App" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:1010/App</a></p>  <p>When I used GWT-Voice lib for playing audio in this project as below code</p>  <pre><code>sound = sc.createSound(Sound.MIME_TYPE_AUDIO_WAV_PCM, "/audio/test.wmv"); sound.setLooping(true); sound.play(); </code></pre>  <p>It will gets 404 not found, due to it will loading from <code>http://localhost:1010/audio/test.wmv</code> whereas the audio is located at <code>http://localhost:1010/App/audio/test.wmv</code></p>  <p>Is there something I had missing or need some other settings?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
