<p>Currently we have Smart gwt 2.5 panel embedded in jfx webview. The panel works pretty well on IE and chrome and  jfx webview using java 7. After upgrading to java 8, the panel is not rendering properly within the jfx webview, but still works properly on IE and chrome.</p>  <ol> <li>Icons, buttons and dropmenus don't appear properly unless hovered over.  </li> <li>Scrollbars don't change position with scroll.</li> </ol>  <p>We tried upgrading to the latest gwt release, but the problem remains.</p>
