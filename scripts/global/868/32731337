<p>I am writing a simple web page, which shows some widgets based on user permission. If user has EDIT permission, the page renders EDIT widget else EDIT widget doesn't shows up. </p>  <p>What is the best way to achieve this? </p>  <p>I, first called a service to get logged in user's permission and then set <strong>visibility: none or block</strong> based on the permission. But, I see that user can "inspect element" on browser and set visibility accordingly. However, on server-side, I am using @PreAuthorize annotation on DAO to control the user actions.</p>  <p>How to control visibility of UI widgets without user being able to make changes, maybe from server side?   </p>  <p><strong>Update : I am looking for JSTL equivalent in GWT</strong></p>
