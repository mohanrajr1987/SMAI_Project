<p>I am working with a Google form with multiple pages. At the end of the form when someone submits the data a message appears to confirm the successful submission. But in there in the last message that appears I need to include an auto generated number as a reference for the user who fills the form. Like, "Thank you for your request. Here is your reference number ABC-XXX."</p>  <p>How can I add such a generated dynamic value to the forms final message?</p>  <p>P.S. I am using this Google form in a Wordpress site.</p>
