<p>I am using Google web toolkit. I have a widget which performs an operation when a user does a mouse over. I want to ensure that if he did mouseover on the widget for a certain time period, only then the mouseover event handler should perform the action else not.</p>  <p>E.g if he mouse overs an HTML for 1s only then the action should occur, else if the mouse over duration is less than 1s, i will take no action.</p>
