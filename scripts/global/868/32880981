<p>On analyzing my website on google pagespeed insight tool I have just got the score of 57/100 for desktop with 7 rules passed.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RMIjH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RMIjH.png" alt="SnapShot of the pageinsight "></a></p>  <p>but when I tested for other blank project on pageinsight I got 96/100 with 8 rules passed.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4gsJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4gsJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I am still unaware how the rules are being passed and how the increase in score is related to the rules passed.</p>  <p>If you analyze stackoverflow it will only have 3 rules passed and 87/100 score.</p>  <p><strong><em>My question</em></strong>  1) Now what else is left so as to increase my gwt web application score on pageinsight tool so to get an optimized website with perfect speed.</p>  <p>2) How are the no of rules related to the score?</p>  <p>Why we with higher no.of rules passed still have lower rank.</p>
