<p>I have to add or remove some classes when vertical scroll appears or goes away. Is there a way to get notification in terms of events?</p>  <p>I have found a lot of fiddles which show how to determine if scrollbar is appearing or not like </p>  <pre><code>&lt;http://jsfiddle.net/vvdb0292/2/&gt; or  &lt;http://jsfiddle.net/kasperfish/GrZp4/3/&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>but here the functions have to be called manually. But I want an event to be triggered in case scroll appears so that I will handle further logic</p>
