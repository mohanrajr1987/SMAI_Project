<p>How can I upgrade from V3 to V4 (and ultimately 5).</p>  <p>Following the upgrade instructions, I get an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to find Objectify.gwt.xml on your classpath</p> </blockquote>  <p>Adding objectify-gwt-1.2.1.jar to my classpath solved that, but then I get the servlet filter error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>NoClassDefFoundError: javax/servlet/Filter</p> </blockquote>  <p>Filters were working fine before, so I assume objectify-gwt is the cause. Do I have the wrong version? How can I resolve this?</p>  <p>This is using the com.google.appengine.tools.development.gwt.AppEngineLauncher developer mode server</p>  <p>EDIT:  This is hell.  Adding the servlet-api jar to the bootclasspath of the Appengine Developer Server gave me an error that some appengine jar couldn't be found . I changed and then re-added the AppEngine version in the project set up to make sure they were there but the error remained so I added the AppEngine libraries to the bootclaspath list instead of the client list (in the run configurations [for the Appengine Dev Server] classpath tab).  Now I have a:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError     at   com.google.appengine.tools.util.Logging.initializeLogging</p> </blockquote>
