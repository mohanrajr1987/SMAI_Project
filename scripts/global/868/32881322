<p>I am writing a GWT client that communicates using REST/Json with .NET services running on IIS.</p>  <p>I have experience using GWT with Java servlets and normal RPC and I know it is possible to send Logger.log output to the remote java server by specifying </p>  <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;set-property name="gwt.logging.simpleRemoteHandler" value="ENABLED" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>in the .gwt.xml module file. And by configuring the servlet in the web.xml file.</p>  <p>I know that this SimpleRemoteHandler uses GWT/RPC for communication. Now my question is, can I write my own RemoteHandler for storing messages on the server, that doesn't use GWT/RPC but just REST/JSON using RequestBuilder ?</p>  <p>A getting started guide of how to do this with a normal Java Servlet or a PHP page, should also be a big help to see which way I have to go to develop this in .NET.</p>
