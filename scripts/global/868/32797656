<p>I have my project of web application in GWT that interact with PayPal Express Checkout sandbox mode. Clicking on the button from the basket page, it is load the page at URL <a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?useraction=commit&amp;token=" rel="nofollow">https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?useraction=commit&amp;token=</a>. The URL until last time worked perfectly. Now I think there is a problem with the https security beacause if you try load <a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?useraction=commit&amp;token=" rel="nofollow">https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?useraction=commit&amp;token=</a> many times at the end it will works. I know that <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/express-checkout/integration-guide/ECGettingStarted/" rel="nofollow">PayPal Express Checkout Documentation</a> say to use the URL: <a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=" rel="nofollow">https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=</a> but I don't like the old graphic and besides it requires confirm payment on my web site, instead I would want the Pay Now button as the last graphic, so I would use that URL. How can I solve it? Thanks!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AQ8Ts.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AQ8Ts.png" alt="old graphic"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5l7R7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5l7R7.png" alt="new graphic with pay button "></a></p>
