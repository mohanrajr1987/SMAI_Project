<p>Gwt Application with Place, Activities etc. </p>  <p>Has anyone else encountered Firefox 41.0 repetitively encoding % in the token of URL - looks like when PlaceController goto() is called? Loops until it crashes!! Token starts out with pipes: #search:advanced|METER|001|false</p>  <p>Encoded to #search:advanced%7CMETER%7C001%7Cfalse</p>  <p>Chrome opens it perfectly, but latest Firefox starts looping, adding an extra 25 (repetitively encoding the % ??)....</p>  <p>Example (from logger): INFO: Tokenized searchPlace: SearchPlace: searchType:advanced%25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525257CMETER%25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525257C001%25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525257Cfalse%252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525257C%252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525257C%252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525257Cfalse%252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525[â€¦]</p>  <p>Did NOT happen in previous version of Firefox - only when we upgraded to 41.0 last weekend! Have checked out the add-ons ... no luck.</p>  <p>Tried messing with the standard-url settings in about:config ... also no luck. </p>  <p>Have gotten around it by adding application code to "decodeURIComponent" when the user.agent contains "gecko" every time getPlace() is called .... but surely there is an easier fix - is it a setting in Firefox that got reset?</p>
