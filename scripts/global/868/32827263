<p>I have an existing GWT project built for a client and it has feature to upload multiple files through a good old file dialogue. It works nicely in all browsers.  I wanted to add a feature to provide a little drop area where the user can drop file(s) and expect them to be uploaded. I wanted to do this with minimal changes to existing code so I ran quick searches on GWT support for File API. It seems that it is still in experimental state.</p>  <p>Then I have reviewed the questions  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19753758/drag-and-drop-file-upload-with-gwt">Drag and Drop file upload with GWT</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17728129/gwt-drag-and-drop-file-upload-not-working">GWT Drag and Drop File Upload not working</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21088340/file-upload-with-a-progress-bar-or-accessing-the-html-5-file-api-from-google-we">File upload with a progress bar, or accessing the Html 5 File Api from Google Web Toolkit?</a></p>  <p>Thanks to the first question I found a gwt-uploader library from Moxie group. I implemented it in my code and it worked like a charm on Firefox.  It also worked fine on Chrome. Unfortunately failed to work on IE 11 and MS Edge browsers. </p>  <p>I have used the show case example Multi-File Upload with Progress Bars and Drag and Drop presented here <a href="http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-uploader/showcase/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-uploader/showcase/index.jsp</a> as the basis for my code. This example also does not work on IE 11 and MS Edge.</p>  <p>Any ideas what may be wrong ?</p>
