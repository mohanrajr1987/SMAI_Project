<p>I'm trying to build a dynamic web app in GWT, when widgets are added to the screen I remember their 'name' by setting the Widget.setId, when I want to replace part of the page, I can find the element in question via DOM.getElementById('name'), and its parent using DOM.getParentElement(), and then remove its children.  </p>  <p>Now I have a com.google.gwt.dom.client.Element object (the parent).  What I want to do is turn this back into a GWT object - in fact it'll be something derived from Panel, so I can add additional Widgets.</p>  <p>How do I go from the Element object back to a Panel object ?</p>  <p>I totally accept I could be going about this the wrong way, in which case is there a better way?</p>
