<p>Hi I am working on project using java GWT using GAE. I am new in GWT. I want to use Task Queue in my project. I understood how to create task by reading <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/" rel="nofollow">these</a> docs. To Create Task we create servlet. So to use task queue first user must initiate the request So how can user initiate the request to Servlet which create the Tasks. shall I initiate request by RPC call or anything else. Any help.</p>
