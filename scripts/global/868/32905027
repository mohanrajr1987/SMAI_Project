<p>I'm trying to use a third party javascript library in GWT. The library I'm using is dhtmlxGantt v3.3.</p>  <p>I know that you need to use $wnd instead of "window" inside native javascript functions in your GWT client code. But the third party library uses "window" inside the .js file. This causes that the library is not working correct.</p>  <p>Is there a way around this problem?</p>
