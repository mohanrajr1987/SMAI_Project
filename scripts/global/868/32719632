<p>So there's a huge, completely unknown GWT project. GWT and Spring are also unknown to me. I really just need to tweak a simple thing. When a request is sent to the server the content type header says:</p>  <pre><code>Content-Type: text/x-gwt-rpc; charset=utf-8 </code></pre>  <p>However server replies with:</p>  <pre><code>Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure why. I wanted to use Filter on that as explained in this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3541165/607407">http://stackoverflow.com/a/3541165/607407</a></p>  <p>I added a filter and when I've put a breakpoint in it, it triggered. This is the code:</p>  <pre><code>      String contentType = httpRequest.getHeader("Content-Type");        if (contentType!=null &amp;&amp; contentType.contains("utf-8") &amp;&amp; contentType.contains("text/x-gwt-rpc") ) {         httpResponse.addHeader("Content-Type", "text/x-gwt-rpc; charset=utf-8"); </code></pre>  <p>So apparently, my header is being overriden, which kinda breaks the point of the filter. There are no other filters specified. Also search for <code>addHeader</code> did not reveal any conflicting usages of that function. So is there yet another XML configuration file I need to dig in?           }</p>
