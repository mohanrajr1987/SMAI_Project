<h2>Overview</h2>  <p>I have an application that consists of a SplitLayoutPanel that has a StackLayoutPanel with two menu selections on the left and a DeckLayoutPanel on the right.  The DeckLayoutPanel has two subpanels, one a SimpleLayoutPanel containing a Label and one a DockLayoutPanel containing a Label and another SimpleLayoutPanel.  The last SimpleLayoutPanel contains a DataGrid.</p>  <p><code> SplitLayoutPanel (TestUI)   |   + StackLayoutPanel   |   |   |   + CellList (Profile)   |   |   |   + CellList (Admin)   |   + DeckLayoutPanel       |       + SimpleLayoutPanel       |   |       |   + Label       |       + DockLayoutPanel (BudgetPanel)           |           + Label           |           + SimpleLayoutPanel (LedgerPanel)               |               + DataGrid </code></p>  <p>All subpanels have their height and width set to 100% by their containing panels.</p>  <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>  <p>The expected behavior is that clicking on the "Budget" menu item in the StackLayoutPanel will show the BudgetPanel, including the LedgerPanel's DataGrid.</p>  <h2>Observed Behavior</h2>  <p>When the "Budget" menu item is clicked, the DockLayoutPanel is displayed, with its header Label, the DataGrid column headers are displayed, but the DataGrid rows do not appear.</p>  <p>When a Label is added to the south area of the DockLayoutPanel, the application compiles but nothing is displayed, not even the top level StackLayoutPanel.</p>  <p>When the DataGrid is replaced with a CellTable, the data is displayed (although the height of each row is much more than necessary to hold the data).</p>  <h2>Questions</h2>  <p>What needs to be done to get the DataGrid to display as expected?</p>  <p>How can the rows be styled to have a smaller height?</p>  <h2>Source Code</h2>  <p>The full source code demonstrating this problem is available on <a href="https://github.com/patrickmay/data-grid-issue/tree/master/TestUI" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>.</p>
