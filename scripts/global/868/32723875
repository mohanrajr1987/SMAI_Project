<p>I'm new to GWT and am doing my first tutorial at <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/create.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/create.html</a>.</p>  <p>I began the tutorial, installed the project in eclipse and deleted it.  I reinstalled the project and now I'm trying to run the development code server  - I got an error and it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>the class JavaLaunchHelper is implemented in both    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java   and   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/libinstrum   One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What can I do now? I really need some help on this!</p>
