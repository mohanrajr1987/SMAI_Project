<p>I'm trying to load a database into iPython so that I can run loops over the data with Python. So far I have the below query that will load the data, which can be printed to iPython: </p>  <pre><code>&gt; sql = %sql SELECT * FROM products  &gt; print sql  +----+--------------+---------------+-------+ | id |    Product   |      Make     | Price | +----+--------------+---------------+-------+ | 0  |    Product1  |      Make1    |   5   | | 1  |    Product2  |      Make2    |   1   | | 2  |    Product3  |      Make2    |   8   | </code></pre>  <p>However I'm having trouble imputing these results into Python. Is there a good way to store data like this into python variables so that I can run loops over the data? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
