<p>I'm trying to understand converting ER diagrams into SQL CREATE statements, but I am having a hard time with understanding how participation constraints work. In an ER diagram a participation constrain is represented by a bold line which means that every tuple in the table must appear in the relationship table. If there is a participation constraint and a key constraint (total) it is possible to fulfil the key constrain.</p>  <p>Is there ever a situation in which there is a way to enforce a participation constraint that isn't also a key constraint without using assertions or check constraints?</p>
