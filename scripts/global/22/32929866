<p><code>state(code, name, country, population) statelanguage(statecode, statelanguage, isofficial, percentage) </code> In table state, code refers to the code of a state, the rest of the attributes are trivial. In table statelanguage, statecode refers the code for a particular state, statelanguage is a language that is spoken in this state, isofficial is a boolean on whether this language is the states official langauge and percentage is the percentage of people who speak the state language. </p>  <p>What I am trying to do is write an SQL statement to select the statecode where atleast two different languages are spoken. </p>  <p>My idea was to first get the statecode for the states that speak only 1 language then subtract this from the original table and project only the statecode. But I am struggling on how to do this.  Thanks</p>
