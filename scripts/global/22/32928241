<p>After researching over and over, (perhaps I am not asking the right question) I am at my wit's end. What I am trying to do is to connect a DB with a page. The page simply collects all of the employee records, and then lists them as hyperlinks. This part I figured out. However, I cannot get the link to produce what I need.</p>  <p>At that point, there should be a listing of all of the attributes of THAT RECORD only. In other words, when you click on 'Mary Smith', everything disappears, and then a record for just her appears - showing name, ID, etc.....</p>  <pre><code>?php $db = new SQLite3('MicroUniversity.db3'); echo "&lt;fieldset style='width: 450px'&gt;"; echo "&lt;h2&gt;Listing Employees&lt;/h3&gt;"; $results = $db-&gt;query('SELECT * from EMPLOYEE ORDER BY EMP_LNAME'); while ($row = $results-&gt;fetchArray()){     $strName = $row['EMP_LNAME'].", ".$row['EMP_FNAME'] . "," . $row['EMP_NUM'];     //$strLink = "&lt;a href = 'person.php? = " . $row['EMP_NUM'] . "'&gt;" . $strName . "&lt;/a&gt;";     $strLink = "&lt;a href =?func=true" . $row['EMP_NUM'] . "'&gt;" . $strName . "&lt;/a&gt;";     echo "&lt;li&gt;".$strLink."&lt;/li&gt;";        }     echo"&lt;/fieldset&gt;"; ?&gt; </code></pre>
