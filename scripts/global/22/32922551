<p>I want <strong>not</strong> update a record when the variable is empty when executing a UPDATE query in SQL. However, when the variable is filled, the record should be updated.</p>  <p>So in example, the myAge field in the database have currently a value of 20 (type int). After executing the following query, the record should still be 20.</p>  <pre><code>$age = '';  db_con-&gt;query("UPDATE info SET myAge = ".$age." WHERE account_id = 1"); </code></pre>  <p>Ps: I know I could check if the variable is empty with PHP, but I was wondering If this could be archieved within SQL?</p>
