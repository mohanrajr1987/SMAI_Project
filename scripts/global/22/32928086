<p>I'm studying some topics of software security and I found this site :  <a href="http://teachcryptography.blogspot.com.br/2015/03/badstore-funway-of-exploiting-web.html" rel="nofollow">http://teachcryptography.blogspot.com.br/2015/03/badstore-funway-of-exploiting-web.html</a></p>  <p>I'm trying to leak data using SQL inject in Quick Item Search form. Here is the query :  </p>  <pre><code>"SELECT itemnum, sdesc, ldesc, price FROM itemdb WHERE '$squery' IN (itemnum,sdesc,ldesc)"; </code></pre>  <p>I got the right answer with this input : <code>1=1'/*</code> but the input <code>'-'</code> is also right. Could someone explain to me why?</p>
