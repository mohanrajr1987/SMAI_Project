<p>I'm getting hung up trying to count records from one table based upon the results of a query.  My table looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>parent_id |  site_id  | description ----------------------------------- A1           1          FL A1           2          NJ A1           A1         Company_A </code></pre>  <p>First I created a query to give me the company name on the same row as the state (description).  My initial query is:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT master.description, sites.description, sites.site_id  FROM sites sites INNER JOIN sites master    ON sites.parent_id = master.site_id </code></pre>  <p>Which results in:</p>  <pre><code>Company_A     FL    1 Company_A     DE    2 </code></pre>  <p>So far so good.  What I want to do, though, is count the number of orders from the <b>ORDERS</b> table for each <b>site_id</b>, even where the number of orders are 0.  </p>  <p>I'm stumped on how to count from the <b>ORDERS</b> table based on the results of my query?  Any help on this join would be appreciated. </p>  <p>UPDATE:   Almost there!  Here's what is working:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT master.description, sites.description, count(order_id) orderCount FROM sites sites INNER JOIN sites master ON sites.parent_id = master.site_id LEFT JOIN orders o ON sites.site_id = o.site_id WHERE sites.site_type = 3 GROUP BY master.description, sites.description, sites.site_id ORDER BY master.description </code></pre>  <p>The only issue I have left is if I add a date range I get the correct results, but any sites with ZERO orders for that period are not shown.  So if I add:</p>  <pre><code>WHERE sites.site_type = 3 AND o.order_date &gt; '2015-10' </code></pre>  <p>I get the correct result but only for sites with orders during that period.  What am I missing?</p>
