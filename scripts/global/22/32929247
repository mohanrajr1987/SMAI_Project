<p>I am working on my assignment which uses this schema (simplified) :</p>  <pre><code>parts(pid,color) catalog(seller_name,pid) </code></pre>  <p>I have to write two queries :</p>  <pre><code>&gt; Find the seller that sell every red part or every green part? </code></pre>  <p>So, from  my understanding,  I have to find sellers that sell every red part, then sellers that sell every green part and do the union.</p>  <p>Another query is :</p>  <pre><code>&gt; Find the seller that sell every red or green part? </code></pre>  <p>How is this query different from the query above?</p>
