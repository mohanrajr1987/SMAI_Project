<p>There is something going wrong with my java configuration and it is really bugging me. I am using IntelliJ IDEA and after downloading and installing java 8 I tried to configure my project to use that SDK but I could only locate version 1.6 under <code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/</code>. I am new to OS X and I am really confused with the paths. Looking on my Java control panel I can see I got installed Java 8 but after running <code>java -version</code> on the terminal I get <code>1.6.0_65</code>. And the <code>which java</code> gives back <code>/usr/bin/java</code>. Please help I am completely lost</p>
