<p>There are similar questions (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13457693/php-find-images-and-links-with-relative-path-in-output-and-convert-them-to-abso">PHP: Find images and links with relative path in output and convert them to absolute path</a>) but I'm not sure they solve this problem. </p>  <p>I am developing a jQuery plugin which could be installed in any directory. It uses images which also could be installed in any directory. The path to the image is set in a data attribute like so:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="pr-preview"     data-img-src="img/example.jpg"     data-savepath="img/resized/"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This is passed to a PHP file with and AJAX function. In my PHP file I need to get the dimensions of the image like so:</p>  <p><code>list($width, $height) = getimagesize($this-&gt;data['img']);</code></p>  <p>But obviously I am getting an error: </p>  <p><code>getimagesize(img/example.jpg): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in ...</code></p>  <p>The PHP file resizes the image and needs to save it to the predefined save path (<code>data-savepath="img/resized/"</code>). I'll also face the same problem here. </p>  <p>So taking into account I won't know where this plugin will be installed when in use, how can I ensure these paths are correct? </p>  <p>If possible I would like to avoid having to put the full paths in the data attributes. </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>This is the plugin folder structure. This folder could be installed anywhere in <code>public_html</code>. And the images directory could be anywhere too:</p>  <pre><code>public_html/             img/                example.jpg             pluginName/                   css/                   js/                   php/                      PluginName.php // where getimagesize() is called </code></pre>
