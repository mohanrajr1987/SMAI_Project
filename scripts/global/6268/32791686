<p>I am trying to install android studio, and it is asking for <code>JAVA_HOME</code> and <code>PATH</code> to be set for my jdk (jdk 1.8.0.60). My issues is I am also using ROR and have RVM set for <code>PATH</code>. How can I add another folder to <code>PATH</code> so I can run android studio?</p>  <p>This currently what my exports look like on .bashrc:</p>  <pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/java/jdk1.8.0_60 </code></pre>
