<p>I want to get path from all images on phone. I used this code but that gives me every file that is in dcim/camera/ directory (it includes videos(.mp4) files which I don't want to get). I want to get path to image in every directory.</p>  <pre><code>String targetPath = ExternalStorageDirectoryPath + "/DCIM/Camera/";  File targetDirector = new File(targetPath);  final File[] files = targetDirector.listFiles(); for (File file : files){     // file is path to file } </code></pre>
