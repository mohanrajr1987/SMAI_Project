<p>I'm having some trouble with glob in php and although I did some research, I just couldn't seem to find an answer to my problem.</p>  <p>First of all to my directory structure:</p>  <pre><code>/ (root)  /images (folder)        - gallery/ (sub folder containing image files)  /pages (folder)        - gallery.php </code></pre>  <p>I want to access the subfolder 'gallery' in the folder 'images'. So: In my gallery.php file I got the following line:</p>  <pre><code>$images = glob("/images/gallery/*.*"); </code></pre>  <p>And this doesn't work.</p>  <p>What does work is, if I change the path to "<strong>../</strong>"</p>  <pre><code>$images = glob("../images/gallery/*.*"); </code></pre>  <p>or if I change the code to:</p>  <pre><code>define('BASE', $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']); $images = glob(BASE."/images/gallery/*.*"); </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunatly the sourcecode then shows some info I'm not sure I want to actually make public</p>  <pre><code>e.g.     /home/scecjwkh/htdocs/images/gallery/3.JPG </code></pre>  <p>I hope the information I provided is enough to actually understand my problem. Not sure why I have so much trouble with a relative path o.O</p>  <p>Thank you in advance, Stuben</p>
