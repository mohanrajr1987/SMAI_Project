<p>I made the switch to Ubuntu a couple of months ago and still do not have very much experience with unix and fish aside from the basic/often used commands. For a C class that I am taking I constantly need to SSH onto a remote linux machine run by my university called Zeus. The command to ssh onto it is a bit lengthy, and I would like to be able to make the process faster with a fish script.</p>  <p>I wrote a file called "zeus.fish" that essentially just calls my ssh command, among a few other things. Currently I can only run it by calling "fish zeus.fish" within the directory of the file. I would like to be able to run the script from within any directory, just like any other command. IE just typing "zeus" would attempt to log me into the remote machine. I'm assuming that I have to do something with PATH. How can I do this? Thanks!</p>
