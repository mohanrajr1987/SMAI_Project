<p>Been Googling and searching here to no avail, so forgive me if this is a duplicate.</p>  <p>Basically, I installed Python 3.4 on my machine (Mac running Yosemite 10.10.2), but when I run <code>python</code> in Terminal, it starts up Python2.7.whatever, which I'm assuming is the version that is often mentioned as coming pre-installed on Macs. I've checked my ~/.bash_profile using vim, and here's what it currently contains:</p>  <pre><code># Setting PATH for Python 3.4 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:${PATH}" export PATH  # Virtualenv Wrapper stuff export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh </code></pre>  <p>Which, according to all the reading I've been doing, should work. But it isn't. Any and all thoughts as to why are appreciated.</p>
