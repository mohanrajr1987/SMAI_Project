<p>I have an assignment with school and they are asking us to create a few directories to put class files. I have the "driver" file in the main directory and then a sub-directory employeeType. Then two subs employee subTypes.</p>  <p>When I try to compile the EmployeeTest.java (the driver) I get the following error.</p>  <p>import employeeType.subTypes.HourlyEmployee;                             ^   bad class file: ./employeeType/subTypes/HourlyEmployee.class     class file contains wrong class: HourlyEmployee     Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.</p>
