<p>I'm trying to open up a file in Android Studio. I created an asset folder that has the path:</p>  <pre><code>app_name\app\src\main\assets\file.csv </code></pre>  <p>When I try to open it using </p>  <pre><code>FileReader file = new FileReader("assets/PlayerDB.csv"); </code></pre>  <p>I get an error that file is not found. To try and figure out the location of the root directory for getting files, I used the following:</p>  <pre><code>File f = new File("test/test.txt"); String Path = f.getAbsolutePath(); Log.v("File Path",Path); </code></pre>  <p>However, this just prints "test/test.txt" to the log. Any ideas on how to get absolute path to work &amp; how to open the file from the assets folder?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
