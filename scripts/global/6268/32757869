<p>I wish my app to write a file in a specified location, and therefore create the appropriate directory if needed. The create dir operation isn't a problem for me, but I need the dir path. I could extract if from the file path, but maybe is there a quick/concise/convenient way of doing the full operation?</p>  <p>I repeat, I'm not searching the basic makedir function, but one which would take the filename of a possibly non-existing file, or a simple qt function to extract the dir path string from the file path string, so I dont' have to write a func for such a basic task.</p>
