<p>I have installed boost libraries. I am using Eclipse to make a simple boost project. </p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;boost/filesystem.hpp&gt;  int main() {     boost::filesystem::path path("/Users/schoen"); // random pathname    bool result = boost::filesystem::is_directory(path);     printf("Path is a directory : %d\n", result);     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I have already set the path of include folder and library folder in the properties of this project. But I was getting a runtime error: <code>dyld: Library not loaded: libboost_system.dylib</code>. To solve this problem, I went to <code>run configuration</code> and set the environment variable <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to <code>/Users/myName/Documents/Softwares/boost_1_59_0/stage/lib</code>. This has solved my problem.</p>  <p><strong>What I need:</strong> I don't want to set the <code>environment variable</code> for each Boost-based project. Therefore, I tried to set my <code>.bash_profile</code>. I wrote the following lines in <code>.bash_profile</code>.</p>  <pre><code># Following lines are for Boost Library DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/myName/Documents/Softwares/boost_1_59_0/stage/lib export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH </code></pre>  <p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> By setting the variable in <code>.bash_profile</code>, I am able to run my program through the terminal. The program also runs if I open the IDE (e.g. Eclipse) via terminal and then run the application. Apparently, <code>.bash_profile</code> can set the variable for terminal applications. <strong><em>How can I set the path for windowed applications too?</em></strong> </p>  <p><strong>PS:</strong> This path setting problem is not just for Boost only, but I have to do similar things for other libraries too (such as OpenCV which is build/installed in a local directory).</p>
