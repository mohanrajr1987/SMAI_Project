<p>How to write a file path that will point to a directory. </p>  <p>From what I have googled,  /path means root,  ./path means current directory,  ../path means parent directory</p>  <p>I am playing with Framer.js + Yeoman.</p>  <p>If you look at the screenshot attached: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wo72b.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wo72b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><code>myLayers = Framer.Importer.load("../imported/test1")</code> is not working? When I put the "imported" folder under the "app" folder it is working.</p>
