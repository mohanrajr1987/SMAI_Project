<p>I'm trying to add the folder <code>~/local/bin</code> to my <code>$PATH</code>, but it does not work. I have tried everything. I have followed every guide on Google and YouTube, I have read dozens of similar questions on StackExchange, I have asked several computer experts I know, I have copied friends' files that works fine for them -- but nothing helps here.</p>  <p>I have tried:</p>  <ul> <li>Adding <code>~/local/bin</code> to <code>/etc/paths</code></li> <li>Adding the path to both <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile</code></li> <li>Written both <code>export PATH=$PATH:~/local/bin</code> and <code>export PATH="$~/local/bin:$PATH"</code></li> <li>Both with and without <code>export</code></li> <li>Tried with both <code>~/local/bin</code>, <code>/Users/Nachos/local/bin</code>, and <code>HOME/local/bin</code></li> </ul>  <p>I have tried every single possible combination of these, and more. That is, I have tried with just the first thing, then just the second thing, then the first and second thing together, then just the third thing, etc etc. I have literally tried more than 50 different things now, and <code>echo $PATH</code>still gives me absolutely nothing but <code>/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin</code>in return. </p>  <p>I have of course also used <code>source [file]</code> after every single change, and also tried restarting the terminal after every change. Nothing helps.</p>  <p>This really frustrates me, as I've used a lot of time trying to fix this, and I find very little help about this online, because this apparently shouldn't ever be an issue to anyone. Well, it doesn't work here. Please, someone, help me. :-(</p>
