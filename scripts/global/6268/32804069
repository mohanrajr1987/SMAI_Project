<p>I used the breeze TempHire sample project (found here: <a href="http://breeze.github.io/doc-samples/temp-hire-angular.html" rel="nofollow">http://breeze.github.io/doc-samples/temp-hire-angular.html</a> ) as a starting point for my project. Upon booting this sample project, i already get a path error in the console (at serializeInstruction ), but the app seemed to run fine so i went with it. Quite some time later, i got to the point where i needed a link with parameters (/:id), and i cannot for the life of me get the router to do it.  Tried with ng-link and the breeze apps method</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="/#/contacts/{{contact.id}}"&gt;{{contact.name}}&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>along with some other attempts, all in vain.  I have tried multiple versions of the router, all the workarounds people found but nothing seems to work. I keep getting the following errors:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'canonicalUrl' of undefined</p>      <p>TypeError: Cannot read property 'canonicalUrl' of undefined       at Grammar.recognize</p> </blockquote>  <p>and while routing on the navbar</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TypeError: Cannot read property 'path' of undefined       at serializeInstruction</p> </blockquote>  <p>To clarify, it appears that only the Grammar.recognize error actually blocks the routing.</p>  <p>Here is the code that causes that error: Initial router config in my shell.js:</p>  <pre><code>self.navigations = [             { href: '/#/home', title: 'Home' },             { href: '/#/contacts', title: 'Contact Management' }         ];          self.$router.config([            { path: '/home', component: 'home' },            { path: '/contacts', component: 'contacts' },         ]);         self.$location.path('/home'); </code></pre>  <p>In contacs.js:</p>  <pre><code>function controller($q, $router, errorhandler, unitofwork, $modal, logger) {     $router.config([         {             path: '/:id',             component : 'tags'         }     ]); </code></pre>  <p>In contacts.html:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;tr class="selectable-row" ng-repeat="contact in contacts.contacts track by $index"&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="/#/contacts/{{contact.id}}"&gt;{{contact.name}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Note: contacts in my project are not related to contacts in the sample app.</p>  <p>Please let me know if more code or clarification is needed. </p>  <p>If somebody has an idea about solving this, i would greatly appreciate your input.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
