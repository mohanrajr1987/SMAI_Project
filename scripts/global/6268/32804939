<p>phpStorm and I agreee this is crazy but "wrong" file paths work while "right" ones fail. Basic structure.</p>  <pre><code>  |   |------classes(directory)   |         |   |         |   |         Person.php   |   |------include(directory)   |         |   |         |   |         db-connect.inc.php   |         autoloader.inc.php   |         helper.inc.php   |   |   |index.php   |etc.php </code></pre>  <p>In index I use: (1)</p>  <pre><code>include_once "include/autoloader.inc.php"; include_once "include/db-connect.inc.php"; include_once "include/helper.inc.php"; </code></pre>  <p>and in Person.php I would expect to use: (2)</p>  <pre><code>include_once "../include/autoloader.inc.php"; include_once "../include/db-connect.inc.php"; include_once "../include/helper.inc.php"; </code></pre>  <p>But that gets is:</p>  <pre><code>"Warning: include_once(../include/autoloader.inc.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in C:\xampp\htdocs\dummy\classes\Person.php on line 2" </code></pre>  <p>Bizarely (3)</p>  <pre><code>include_once "/../include/autoloader.inc.php"; include_once "/../include/db-connect.inc.php"; include_once "/../include/helper.inc.php"; </code></pre>  <p>works and even more bizarely so does (4)</p>  <pre><code>include_once "include/autoloader.inc.php"; include_once "include/db-connect.inc.php"; include_once "include/helper.inc.php"; </code></pre>  <p>even though we are up one directory level!</p>  <p>phpStorm flags 3 and 4 as errors (says "Path include/autoloader.inc.php not found" and "Include expression is not resolved") while (2), which is what I thought was "right", gets a nice big green tick but fails at debug or if directly accessed via <a href="http://localhost" rel="nofollow">http://localhost</a> etc.</p>  <p>I always struggle with these path things but how come phpStorm and I agree and the real world say nope!</p>  <p>Guess I will have to put <code>$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']</code> in all over the place (lot easier with Storm instead of longhand!) but still a pain!</p>
