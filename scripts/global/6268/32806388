<p>Suppose I have network with 4 nodes and 4 edges as shown below<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8XD0E.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8XD0E.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>All possible paths from source node <strong>1</strong> to destination node <strong>4</strong> are </p>  <blockquote>   <p>{{A,C}, {A,B,D}}</p> </blockquote>  <p>From these possible paths, I want to create a zero-one matrix, where number of rows represents the number of paths and number of columns represents the number of edges in a network. The matrix takes <strong>1</strong> as entry if the edge is present in the path to reach destination node, and <strong>0</strong> as its entry if it is not. For above network, path matrix is </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[1 0 1 0; 1 1 0 1]    This is because all possible paths are two and hence two rows, and there are 4 edges and hence 4 columns.   I have a large complex network with 15 nodes and 107 paths to which I need to apply this technique. Please help.</p> </blockquote>
