<p>so I'm looking towards porting a .jar to an executable and am cleaning my code up a bit before I do that. Right now I have the following:</p>  <pre><code>BufferedImage bgImg = null; //Grabs the background image     try {         bgImg = ImageIO.read(new File(""));     } catch (IOException e1) {         e1.printStackTrace();     } </code></pre>  <p>I have several other images that I can just use:</p>  <pre><code>new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("imagename.png"))); </code></pre>  <p>However, since the former is a File object it does not take the same type of argument. I was wondering if there is something similar that I can use for that, or if there is some other way to make the File absolute so that there are no errors when porting to an executable. Thanks!</p>
