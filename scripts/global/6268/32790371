<p>I am able to read and alter a text file whilst in Eclipse, however when exported as a "Runnable JAR" it no longer works, it seems to me that the relative path is from inside the JAR, not to the JAR.</p>  <pre><code>BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("RELATIVE PATH")); </code></pre>  <p>I want it so that if I export my program as program.jar, and have file.txt in the same folder as program.jar, it opens file.txt if that is the relative path set.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
