<p>I am working on a cordova app, and would like to set the the splashscreen in portrait mode. I am using the cordova screenorientation plugin to achieve the same. But when I open the app, the splash screen shows up in landscape mode and in few seconds moves to portrait mode. I am guessing this happens because the plugin is not yet loaded.I am calling screen.lockorientation('portrait') only after 'deviceready' is fired. </p>
