<p>When the device is in portrait orientation I have tableView and graphView in a viewController. When i change to landscape mode, i want to display only graphView. I am using size classes to do it. It works for all iPhones. </p>  <p>But for iPad, Size classes for portrait and landscape are same (regular width and height). </p>  <p>I need to set different constraints for portrait and landscape mode.How do i remove tableView when the device is in landscape.</p>
