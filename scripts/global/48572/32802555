<p>I have a game that I created in Unity 5 on my pc. It implements the Vungle Unity plugin for video ads. It runs perfectly fine on Android but as soon as I copied the project, moved it to my mac, switched the platform to iOS, and tried to build it, I get the error: <strong>symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64</strong>.</p>  <p>I have been researching this for days and have had zero luck figuring out a resolution. The architecture in Unity was set to universal and it is set to build a device sdk. I am trying to test on an iPhone 5. It runs fine on simulators, just not when trying to launch it on a real device.</p>  <p>Here is the full error I get:</p>  <pre><code>Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: "__vungleClearCache", referenced from:   _VungleBinding_clearCache_m756 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o   _VungleBinding__vungleClearCache_m755 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleClearCache_m755) "__vungleClearSleep", referenced from:   _VungleBinding_clearSleep_m758 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o   _VungleBinding__vungleClearSleep_m757 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleClearSleep_m757) "__vungleEnableLogging", referenced from:   _VungleBinding_enableLogging_m746 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o   _VungleBinding__vungleEnableLogging_m745 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleEnableLogging_m745) "__vungleGetEndPoint", referenced from:   _VungleBinding__vungleGetEndPoint_m761 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleGetEndPoint_m761) "__vungleIsAdAvailable", referenced from:   _VungleBinding_isAdAvailable_m748 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o   _VungleBinding__vungleIsAdAvailable_m747 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleIsAdAvailable_m747) "__vunglePlayAdEx", referenced from:   _VungleBinding__vunglePlayAdEx_m750 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vunglePlayAdEx_m750) "__vunglePlayAdWithOptions", referenced from:   _VungleBinding__vunglePlayAdWithOptions_m749 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vunglePlayAdWithOptions_m749, _VungleBinding__vunglePlayAdWithOptionsEx_m751 ) "__vunglePlayAdWithOptionsEx", referenced from:   _VungleBinding__vunglePlayAdWithOptionsEx_m751 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vunglePlayAdWithOptionsEx_m751) "__vungleSetEndPoint", referenced from:   _VungleBinding__vungleSetEndPoint_m759 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleSetEndPoint_m759) "__vungleSetSoundEnabled", referenced from:   _VungleBinding_setSoundEnabled_m744 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o   _VungleBinding__vungleSetSoundEnabled_m743 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleSetSoundEnabled_m743) "__vungleStartWithAppId", referenced from:   _VungleBinding__vungleStartWithAppId_m741 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_0.o  (maybe you meant: _VungleBinding__vungleStartWithAppId_m741) ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>  <p>I have been working on this for way too long and it is just not working out very well. Here are a few things I have tried:</p>  <p>1) Change architectures to Standard Architectures (armv7 arm64)</p>  <p>2) Change "Build active architecture only" to NO</p>  <p>3) Change "Dead code stripping" to NO</p>  <p>4) Add $(inherited) to "Other Linker Flags"</p>  <p>5) Make sure the VungleSDK.framework is added to the binary links</p>  <p><strong>9/26/15</strong></p>  <p>From everything that I have read online, these errors mean that I should be missing a framework, most likely one that would have the VungleBinding file in it. The VungleBinding.m file is not part of the framework though and if I link the VungleBinding.m file by itself, I still get these errors. However this VungleBinding.m file does contain the methods that are referenced in the error message provided.</p>  <p><strong>9/27/15</strong></p>  <p>Well this is just great...I now realize that the only simulators that are working are for the iPhone 5 and older. Anything newer than that gives me this error:</p>  <pre><code>dyld: Symbol not found: _CloseZStream </code></pre>
