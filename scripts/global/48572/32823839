<p>My Employer would like me to take a web application written entirely in PHP to be accessible while offline. (it has to be accessible by an ipad without internet connection.) </p>  <p>I have tried the following things:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://solesignal.com/draftcode/" rel="nofollow">http://solesignal.com/draftcode/</a></li> <li><a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/codereviewer/15-code-editors-for-the-ipad-for-free-or-very-cheap/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.smartbear.com/codereviewer/15-code-editors-for-the-ipad-for-free-or-very-cheap/</a></li> <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/offline-pages-save-complete/id364859644?mt=8" rel="nofollow">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/offline-pages-save-complete/id364859644?mt=8</a></li> </ul>  <p>Before I'm going to spend <strong>any</strong> money i have to be 100% positive it works.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how i can achieve this? </p>
