<p>I am designing a 3D game for ipad and iphone using SceneKit. I noticed that the ipad 3 cant handle the game, although I only use less than 3k vertices and 2 lights. Pretty strange. Could someone give approximate numbers of how how much vertices counted by sceneKit statistics can various Aplle devices handle? </p>  <p>EDIT: I'm down on 500 vertices. It STILL cant handle it :O</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bo2Cu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bo2Cu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
