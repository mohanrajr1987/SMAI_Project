<p>Can anyone tell me if there is a way to change the default file size of photos when they are taken on an Ipad v 8.4, without having to get 3rd party software. I have a website that people upload images too, using an Ipad. The current default file size of the photo's taken on the Ipad are just over 1mb per photo. The users of the service are only allocated a small amount of file space on the server, and I am concerned with photos this large they will go over their allocation. Any help would be appreciated</p>
