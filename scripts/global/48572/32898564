<p>Just completed converting my first iPhone-only app to a universal app.  Began work converting my second iPhone-only app that's been in the app store for some time to universal.  Changing Devices from iPhone to Universal under General/Deployment Info section of my target doesn't produce the iPhone and iPad selectors as it did in the first app I converted.  I've added a second storyboard and the Main storyboard file base name (iPad) = iPad property to my plist.  I need to use two storyboards, and need the iPhone/iPad selectors to appear.  I'm using Xcode v7.0. Sorry I can't post a screen shot, as my rep isn't high enough.</p>
