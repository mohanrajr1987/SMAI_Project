<p>I have written an iPad app for use in browser, but I am having difficulty scaling the screen to precisely the size of the device.</p>  <p>I have set my game's viewport div width to 1520px by 1024px, but it still isn't right.</p>  <p>Additionally I have used <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no,maximum-scale=1,height=device-height"&gt;</code> in an attempt to scale it to size again.</p>  <p>The website is located here: <a href="http://charlieharding.com/settlers/" rel="nofollow">http://charlieharding.com/settlers/</a></p>  <p>Any advice is appreciated</p>
