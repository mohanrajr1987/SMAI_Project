<p>I'm trying to convert a portrait-only iPhone calculator app to universal to gain app store acceptance using Xcode 7.  I'm looking at the storyboard and iPhone and iPad storyboard previews side-by-side (my rep isn't high enough to post screen shots).  The iPhone storyboard preview shows the correct layout, but the app fills only about 25% of the top left corner of the iPad storyboard preview.  After much trial-and-error setting constraints, I now have the background image of the calculator filling the iPad storyboard preview.  However all the calculator buttons remain in the top left of the iPad preview.  I'm at a complete loss for how to change the button size and locations in the iPad storyboard preview without affecting the iPhone storyboard preview.  I've tried changing the "w" and "h" settings at the bottom of the storyboard.  The w = REGULAR and h = REGULAR settings allow me to change button locations in the iPad preview only by dragging, but the storyboard has a square aspect ratio, so I can't move the bottom row of buttons low enough to fit the iPad screen in portrait mode.  Other "w" and "h" storyboard settings will change both iPhone and iPad storyboard previews.  Can anyone provide a suggestion for what I'm doing wrong, what I'm missing or a link to a tutorial that would actually help me with this?</p>
