<p>I'm having a problem with making roll overs work in an interactive pdf for iPad and mobile devices. I've spent hours looking for a resolution, but have found nothing for this specific issue...</p>  <p>What I have is sections in the document where the viewer can answer questions via check boxes. The check boxes work fine. However the check boxes for the incorrect answers trigger, on roll over, a 'pop-up' window that will nudge them to the correct answer. I have tried doing this through InDesign at the design stage and through Acrobat. Right now the functionality is primarily through Acrobat (seems to be closer to the end goal).</p>  <p>I'm not sure if it's as simple as a setting or what? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. More specific information can be given if needed. Thanks!</p>
