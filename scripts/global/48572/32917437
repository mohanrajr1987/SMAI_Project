<p>I have a game where the settings are landscape only. When I run it on an iPhone simulator in Xcode, it runs in landscape mode like it should. When I run it on an iPad simulator, the iPad doesn't go to landscape mode when it opens the app.</p>  <p>Why is this and how can I fix it? I have looked for an answer but was unable to find one.</p>  <p>In addition to the landscape problem the frames per second on the iPad is extremely low, at about 18 whereas the iPhone 6 is about 30 and the 4s is 55, is there anyway to get the frame rate of the bigger devices up? I am running Xcode 6.4</p>
