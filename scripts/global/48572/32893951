<p>i've got a problem with TestFlight.</p>  <p>My app works fine in iOS simulator (8.1 &amp; 9.1) and on my iPad (9.0.2) when connected over USB cable. Now i want to share my app over TestFlight with some friends. After download and install via TestFlight the same app don't work on the same iPad it worked fine before.</p>  <p>When i start the TestFlight version it takes some seconds then the screen turns black and after a few more seconds i get back to the home screen. After connecting the iPad again there are no crash logs on device.</p>  <p>What can i do to find the error? Is there a possibility to debug TestFlight apps with the debug console from xcode?</p>
