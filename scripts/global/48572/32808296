<p>How does someone check if an Apple device is suitable for playing a game a developed. I realised that in some cases, the devices that are 3 years old have too humble performance and my games have a lag because of that. Is there a test I can run to determine if my app can be played on for example iPad3 or iphone 5. </p>
