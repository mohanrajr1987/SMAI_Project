<p>I have an iPhone app built with <code>Xcode 7</code>. Its deployment target is 7.0. At first, when running the app on the <code>iPad</code>, there no launch images.</p>  <p>I later solved it by checking iOS 6.0 and Prior so launch images would appear on the <code>iPad</code>. But now i get " An iphone retina (4-inch) launch image for ios 7.0 and later is required. " in the <code>Assets.xcassets</code>.</p>  <p>Whenever I try to add the images for <code>iPad</code> Portrait, Landscape and iPhone Portrait in <code>iOS 7.0</code> and later, the error disappears, however no launch images appear on my iPad 3rd gen. How can i fix that?</p>
