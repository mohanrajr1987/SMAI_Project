<p>I have a question regarding the iOS9 keyboard.</p>  <p>The keyboard works fine in the simulator in terms that the hide button hides the keyboard and so forth. However, when using my app - it's not alike. </p>  <p>It does work fine within the first view controller, but when pushing all of the next ones - it just simply doesn't hide the keyboard.</p>  <p>Moreover, the gestures seemed to be quite confused as well. Namely by defining a     UILongPressGesture and its minimum tap duration to 10, it activates its associated method after a second. The same applies when using the keyboard - when it opens, the paste option activates itself immediately.</p>  <p>I know it's hard to tell from this description, however I cannot paste the entire app ;) </p>  <p>Any clue what could be going on? Any similar experience?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
