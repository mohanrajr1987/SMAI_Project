<p>Suppose I have a integer number 10. and my NSMutableArray contains 1 to 20 values. So I have to find maximum of 10 from NSMutableArray means the answer is 11.</p>  <p>I know how to find maximum number.</p>  <pre><code>int max = [[numbers valueForKeyPath:@"@max.intValue"] intValue]; </code></pre>  <p>But I don't know how to compare and find maximum number from array. I can use for loop to find but is there any faster solution like above?</p>
