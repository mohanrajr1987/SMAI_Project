<p>I have an <code>iPad</code> app that uses thousands of <code>UITextFields</code> and <code>UITextViews</code> throughout it. When text is being entered into these elements, the iOS default <code>keyboard</code> is used. However, because my app does not provide <code>dictation</code> support, it crashes whenever the user attempts to dictate. Some research into the subject has shown that it isn't possible to disable the <code>dictation</code> feature on the default <code>keyboard</code>. </p>  <p>Instead, I found that it is recommended to use a change the type of <code>keyboard</code> to one that doesn't offer a <code>dictation</code> option. The problem is that I have thousands of <code>UITextFields</code> and <code>UITextViews</code> throughout my app, so manually going in and changing the keyboard type of each of these is unfeasible. My question is this: is there a way to change the default <code>keyboard</code> used within an app? </p>
