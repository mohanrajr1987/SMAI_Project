<p>I'm developing drawing app for iPad. I make my drawings in drawRect and everything work fine on iPad Mini 1/2/3, iPad Air but on iPad Air 2 is extremely slow. I'm drawing rectangle on iPad Mini 1 it takes 0.01 seconds but on iPad Air 2 it takes more than 2 seconds.</p>  <p>All of the iPads are with iOS 9 (I've tested with 3 iPad Air 2)</p>  <p>Do you have any suggestions why on the fastest iPad drawing is slow?</p>
