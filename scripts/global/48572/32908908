<p>So basically I'm trying to make an old website mobile by injecting CSS/js via a UIWebview on the iPad. I would like to be able add local images that are present in the bundle/iPad and inject that into the view. Yet it doesnt seem to work. I believe the issue is that the UIWebview is pointed to my website URL so when the HTML attempts to look up the file its doing it on the server instead of the local iPad?</p>  <p>Of course hosting the image on the server is an obvious work around for this and I will fall back to that option if needed but its not what I really want to do. Is there a way to accomplish this?</p>  <p>So far I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>        var imageFileName: String = "myImage"         var imageFileExtension: String = "png"          // load the path of the image in the main bundle          var imagePath: String = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource(imageFileName, ofType: imageFileExtension, inDirectory:"img")!          // generate the html tag for the image          let imgCSS: String = "div.landingIcon{width:100px;height:100px;background-size:100% 100%;margin:0 auto;opacity:0.03;background-image:url('file://\(imagePath)')}"             "div.landingIcon {" +                "width: 100px;" +                "height: 100px;" +                "background-size: 100% 100%;" +                "margin: 0 auto;" +                "opacity: 0.03;" +               "color: white;" +               "background-image: url('file://\(imagePath)');}"          //Add the CSS between style tags.             var siteStyleContentString3 = String(format:                 "var link = document.createElement('style');\n" +                     "link.innerHTML = '%@';\n" +                     "link.setAttribute('class', 'myImageClass');\n" +                     "link.id = 'iconImage';\n" +                 "document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(link);", imgCSS)  theWebView.stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString(siteStyleContentString3); </code></pre>
