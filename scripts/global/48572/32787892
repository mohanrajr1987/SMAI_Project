<p>I have an issue to login in my Magento dashboard with my Apple devices (iphone 6 and iPad) which occurred 2 weeks ago. <strong>What is strange is that last month I had no issue to connect to Magento</strong> thus I used the saved backup of my website back at the time before the issue occurred but the issue still remain. Then I browsed over several discussions on that topic such as: - <a href="http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/31933/customer-login-doesnt-work-in-1-9">Link 1</a>, - <a href="http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/52088/cant-login-with-safari-on-ipad-magento-1-8">Link 2</a> (related to system->configuration->general->web->session cookie management), - <a href="http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/49134/customers-couldnt-login-from-safari-in-magento-1-9">Link 3</a>, But none of them help me to solve my login issue with Apple devices only.</p>  <p>If anyone has an idea please let me know. Thank you for your help.</p>
