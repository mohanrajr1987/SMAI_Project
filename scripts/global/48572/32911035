<p>I'm trying to submit an app to TestFlight, but have been rejected twice for this reason:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>2.3 Details</p>      <p>However, we attempted to review your app but were unable to install   the app on iPad. The UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities key in the   Info.plist is set in such a way that the app will not install on an   iPad.</p>      <p>Next Steps</p>      <p>Please check the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities key to verify that it   contains only the attributes required for your app features or the   attributes that must not be present on the device. Attributes   specified by a dictionary should be set to true if they are required   and false if they must not be present on the device.</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I try to launch the app on the ipad simulator, I'm getting the error:</p>  <pre><code>Oct  2 11:32:04 exploiter.local com.apple.dt.Xcode[59574] &lt;Error&gt;: Error   Domain=LaunchServicesError Code=0  "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.
