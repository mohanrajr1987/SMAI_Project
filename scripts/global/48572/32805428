<p>I made an iPhone app using Apple's SceneKit. On iPhone 5s the app runs with 60fps with very occasional drops to 40fps (I think that happens when not much is changing in the scene). I tried to run the same app, made absolutely no chnages to the code, on an iPad 3 and the app has a huuuuge lag. fps never go above 16. I was comparing the gpu models of 5s and iPad 3 and they are both A7. Why am I experiencing such drastic drop in fps? Is this a hardware problem and I need to lower the graphical intensity of my app?</p>  <p>Edit: the iPad is 3 years in use iOS9, 5s 7 months and runs iOS8.4</p>
