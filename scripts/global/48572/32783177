<p>I am dealing with quite a conceptional problem.</p>  <p>In my "universal" app i have a "table-view-controller" with a list of records which segueÂ´s to a "view-controller".</p>  <p>On iPad Version of this app it behaves exactly like on the iPhone.</p>  <p>What i wanted to implement on iPad Version:</p>  <p>One View with "table-view-controller" on the left side and "view-controller" on the right side.</p>  <p>And when users selects a record from "table-view-controller" on the left side, this record is loaded directly in the "view-controller" on the right side.</p>  <p>Should i create a different storyboard to achieve this or create some:</p>  <pre><code>if (iPhone) {     // iPhone     // do this } else {     // iPad     // do this } </code></pre>  <p>conditions directly in code?</p>  <p>Thanks and Greetings!</p>
