<p>is it possible to create a bundled Jar and add it to the shared-libs folder at my tomcat installation?</p>  <p>I have multiple projects that are using the camel packages, so i tried to put the jars to tomcat/libs and it works fine. But it would be nicer if i could add all the single jars to a bundled one.</p>  <p>I tried already with the one-jar-plugin: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/onejar-maven-plugin/" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/onejar-maven-plugin/</a> But there, the output of tomcats says that it couldn't find the cxfservlet class.</p>  <p>With the Maven-Assembly-Plugin i get the error message that it couldn't find the namespacecontext of camel-cxf.</p>  <p>Do you have any other ideas what i can do? Or is it impossible?</p>  <p>Thanks, Chris</p>
