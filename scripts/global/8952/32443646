<p>clang++ and g++ are ABI incompatible, even for things as core as standard containers, according to, e.g., the clang++ website.</p>  <p>Debian ships with C++ shared libraries, i.e. libboost, etc... that are compiled with ~something and user programs using both compiler generally work, and the library names aren't mangled with the compiler that was used for them. When you install clang, debian doesn't go and pull in duplicate versions of every C++ library installed on your system.</p>  <p>What's the deal?  Is the ability of clang to link against distro-provided C++ libraries just way stronger than the (thankfully cautious) compiler devs describe it to be?  </p>
