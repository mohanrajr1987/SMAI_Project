<p>I am trying to build a Linux uImage and device tree for the zynq but my computer cant find the aio_abi.h file. I have moved the Linux folder which contains the file into the shared library folder that my system is looking but the file is still not being found. I think this is because there is no .so file for the folder containing the aio_abi file. I installed libaio-dev using the Ubuntu software installer tool because get-apt isn't working on my machine because of a proxy. </p>  <p>Is there a way to directly create a .so file for the folder I need to include or is there something wrong with the libaio-dev install? I have an older libaio1.so file but the older version doesn't contain the aio_abi file required.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
