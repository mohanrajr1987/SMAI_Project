<p>I recently took over some RPM work while one of our colleagues is away. During the post installation step, the RPM installs some libraries in a particular location, writes a file to /etc/ld.conf.so.d/ containing the path to these files, and then runs "ldconfig". But when the call is made, there are quite few messages stating that: "libXYZ.so* is not a symbolic link". </p>  <p>I looked at the files and the sym links are not set up correctly. E.g., libA.so.1 and libA.so.1.1 are identical files, instead of libA.so.1->libA.so.1.1. Whenever ldconfig is run on a system with the RPM installed, these messages are shown.</p>  <p>Now for no particular reason, I tried replicating this by creating a shared library called libmylib.so.1.1. Then I created another file called libmylib.so.1 which was identical to the previous file. I added a test.conf file to /etc/ld.conf.so.d which contains the path to these shared libraries, and then ran ldconfig. But I didn't see any of these "not a symlink" messages. Instead ldconfig set up two symlinks to both these files. Is that message displayed only under particular circumstances?</p>  <p>Also, when I'm installing shared libraries, do I need to setup the links such as:</p>  <p>linker name -> so name -> real name</p>  <p>manually? And then run ldconfig?</p>  <p>This is my first time working with RPM and installing shared libraries, so any input would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
