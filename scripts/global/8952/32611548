<p>I have below error when starting my android app:</p>  <pre><code>dlopen failed: Cannot locate symbol "rand" referenced by  libjninice.so </code></pre>  <p>I Searched on internet for the solution and I got to know that if I change my Android-platform to 19 and my Toolchain-version to 4.8 ,it will work. But in my case I need some workaround for this, becauase I have to make it work for android-platform 21 . </p>  <p>PS- I have built all my libraries using Android-ndk r10e Toolchain-version-4.9 and Android-platform=21</p>
