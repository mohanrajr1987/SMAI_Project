<p>I have to migrate a C++ win desktop app to a mobile one (android first then iOS) using VS2015. The UI will be revamped but, in order to minimize the cost, I have to re-use all the libraries (static and dynamic) coded in C++. </p>  <p>I'm wondering what is the proper way to do that : in my current Win C++ project, the linking chain of the libs I want to reuse is the following :  <strong><em>Lib1</strong> is linked by <strong>Lib2</strong> that is linked by <strong>DLL1</em></strong>. DLL1 is used by the main program</p>  <p>In my new vs2015 cross-platform project, the final library will be apparently a .so file. What's the best way to do this job : </p>  <ul> <li>Create 2 .a libs and 1 .so lib and add respectively the code of Lib1, Lib2 and DLL1 in these new projects</li> <li>Keep the <strong>LIB1</strong> and <strong>LIB2</strong> and create just 1 .so lib that will link the 2 .lib files and that will contain the <strong>DLL1</strong> code</li> <li>Keep the <strong>LIB1, LIB2 and transform DLL1 into a static LIB3</strong> and create a .so lib that links and wrap the LIB3</li> <li>Another proper way I don t know about</li> </ul>  <p>Thanks for your appreciated help </p>
