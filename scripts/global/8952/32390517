<p>I have an application say App.exe which is dependent on dlls</p>  <p>A, B, C and D. D is also dependent on A.</p>  <p>I run my application and view my App.exe expect in Process explorer. In process explorer lower pane with dll info shown, I expect to see only one instance of A.dll as its code is supposed to be shared by both App.exe and D.dll. But instead I see two instances. Does the sharing happen only across applications and not withing the same application?</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?  </p>
