<p>I am facing one problem, when searching any concept on web is : Including libraries i.e, <code>var Reac= require('react');</code>  I think they use npm to install libraries and import it syntax like <code>require('...')</code></p>  <p>I want to use in webstorm, so probably i need to copy react.js in lib and import it when i build any React component.</p>  <p>for example: to use </p>  <pre><code>import React from 'react' class Dropdown extends React.Component { </code></pre>  <p>where i have to keep the react.js file.</p>  <p>Could you please suggest any example or folder structure for projets and library.</p>
