<p>I'm looking for an alternative way to share singleton instances between the main executable and dll's.</p>  <p>My project currently consists of several static libs which are linked into executables as shown below:</p>  <pre><code>  common.lib (holds singletons)       /             \      /               \     v                 \ tools.exe              \                         V                   database.lib (holds singletons)                         |                         V                    shared.lib (holds singletons)                      /                     /                    |                    v                game.lib (holds singletons)                    |                    v           I-- Extension.dll                 server.exe &lt;---I-- Extension.dll (dynamic loaded extensions)                                I-- Extension.dll                                        ^                                        | +--------------------------------------------------------+ I Extensions loaded through LoadLibrary &amp; dlopen         I I need to have access to the singletons instantiated in: I I common.lib, database.lib, shared.lib and game.lib      I </code></pre>  <p>The static lib's provide several singletons which i want to expose to dynamic loaded dll's, <strong>which are always binary compatible to the main exe</strong>.</p>  <p>I can't just convert the static libs into dynamic libs because it would break a lot and is too much effort. My current approach is to turn the static singleton getters:</p>  <pre><code>class Log { public:     static Log* instance(); }; </code></pre>  <p>into something like:</p>  <pre><code>class Log { };  __declspec(dllexport) Log* instance(); </code></pre>  <p>and export the singleton instances though seperate dynamic libs for example:</p>  <p><code>common_inst.dll</code> exports singletons for <code>common.lib</code>.</p>  <p><code>game_inst.dll</code> exports singletons for <code>game.lib</code>.</p>  <p>This approach works but i'm not satisfied with it.</p>  <p>Is there another crossplatform compatible possibility to share singletons to shared lib's without exporting it through dllexport?</p>
