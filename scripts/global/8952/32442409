<p>I created an Android Library in Android studio. I now want to make it available for others to use it. It uses Google Play Services and a drawable (drawable isnt necessary). My issue is I can only find reading on importing libraries, not exporting them.</p>  <p>I want to make this library downloadable. Does anyone have steps to exporting it and packaging it so people can reference it in a build.gradle file.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
