<p>my name is Alex. I wonder how I install a library in CodeBlocks. I know this is obvious. But I find it hard and decided to ask the wonderminds on stack.</p>  <p>So I have this library <a href="http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/</a> that I want to install in the CodeBlocks IDE for C++. How do I do it? Does anybody know a <strong>detailed</strong> tutorial for this. Thank you.</p>
