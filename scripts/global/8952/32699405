<p>While I was working on a small shared library, in which I'm using enums as flags, as usual, and as I'm using Qt, I'm using the <code>Q_DECLARE_FLAGS</code>, <code>Q_FLAG</code> and the <code>Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS</code> macros. Now I've been wondering, as normally the <code>Q_DECL_EXPORT</code> macro has to be put in front of every class/function that should be exported from the shared library, what about inline functions fully defined in a public header file, to be used by the user, like <code>Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS</code> does? Is it needed to put the export macro there too?</p>
