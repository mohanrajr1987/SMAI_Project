<p>I have a jquery library in my project but need to put it in linux /usr/share/js directory and not inside of my project directory.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do a linking in the index.html?   </p>  <p>Including in the index.html:</p>  <pre><code>   &lt;script src="/usr/share/js/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;       </code></pre>  <p>doesn't help, as it looks into my working dir and I don't have a 'usr' dir</p>  <p>/usr/share is in the root directory and not in my working one. I don't use any php or the stuff, is there a simple way to solve this?</p>
