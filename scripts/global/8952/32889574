<p>I need to include a framework on </p>  <pre><code>General -&gt; Embedded Libraries </code></pre>  <p>to make my application works. There are two ways (known by me) to do this: drag and drop or clicking button "+" and choosing the framework. In both cases, Xcode put an absolute path.</p>  <p>There is a way to put a relative path? </p>  <p>I'm thinking to do from terminal with nano editing:</p>  <pre><code>ProjectName.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj </code></pre>
