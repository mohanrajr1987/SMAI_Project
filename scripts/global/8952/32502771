<p>does it mean </p>  <blockquote>   <p>multiple android apps sharing the same code at runtime</p> </blockquote>  <p>or </p>  <blockquote>   <p>other way around?</p> </blockquote>  <p>i am thinking that it is the concept though which multiple apps sharing the common code before building process but after building process all app binary(i.e  .apk) files have their own copy of the same shared library code.</p>  <p>am i thinking right?</p>  <p>if i am right what are the possibilities to achieve this(i.e to share a library between two or more apps at run time)?</p>
