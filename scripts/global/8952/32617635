<p>I am trying to create a shared C++ shared library. I am able to compile the library. But calling any class member function(static or not) is failing with "undefined reference"</p>  <p>I did some search and found out that I should be defining the methods in the class definition itself. Is that true ? Currently I am not doing that. I am using .hpp and .ccp for declaring and defining class methods.</p>
