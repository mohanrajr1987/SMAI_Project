<p>I have a binary 'program' which links against several shared libraries 'library1.so', 'library2.so' and 'library3.so'.</p>  <p>With ldd I can see that libary3.so cannot be found even though it is in /usr/local/lib:</p>  <pre><code>$ ldd program         library1.so.1 =&gt; (0x00007fff26ffe000)         library2.so.10 =&gt; /usr/local/lib/library2.so.10 (0x00007fa67087d000)         library3.so =&gt; not found </code></pre>  <p>The strange thing is that the other lib 'library2.so' is found at exactly the location where 'library3.so' is. </p>  <p>I <em>could</em> fix this using LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but I would like to avoid that.</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong>: Which other options do I have to fix a missing library?</p>
