<p>Why is ndk-build producing two different libraries, one very large and one smaller?  And which should I use?</p>  <p>The smaller one is written in a <code>libs/armeabi-v7a</code> folder (the build process creates the folders) and the <code>libs</code> folder is at the same level of the <code>jni</code> folder containing the source being built. The .so file is 747 KB</p>  <p>The bigger one is written in an <code>obj/local/armeabi-v7a</code> folder (again, all created by the build process) and the <code>obj</code> folder is at the same level of the <code>jni</code> folder containing the source being built. The .so file is 6.7 MB.</p>
