<p>Is there a way to <em>quickly</em> find all svn:externals references to a URL on-demand, among repositories that we control, using svn, TortoiseSVN, and/or some other tool? (e.g. Plugin/extension, hook scripts, etc.)</p>  <p>If not, would the correct/best way be to create a post-commit hook script that "registers" any added or modified svn:external references in a file or database somewhere, and then finding the external references would reference that info? And we could seed the file/database with <code>svn propget -R svn:externals</code> (perhaps with some text mangling), right?</p>  <h1>Details</h1>  <p>We're getting ready to start using svn:externals internally among our developer team for shared source libraries. We'll peg our revs<sup>1</sup> in any svn:external reference, to ensure that we can roll back to prior repo states. Most of us use TortoiseSVN as our frontend, most of the time.</p>  <p>As a point of comparison, I've heard that the much (and rightly) maligned Visual SourceSafe had such a feature, something like right-click &rarr; "where used". With such a feature, when we want to change a shared module, we can see which projects it may potentially affect.</p>  <hr>  <p>Note: This question is not a duplicate of any of these, because I'm asking about how to do it quickly, which would require having the info cached. It has been noted that <code>svn propget</code> can take hours or even days to return, depending on the repository.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/681833/list-all-svnexternals-recursively">List all svn:externals recursively?</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3725266/how-to-find-all-entries-in-svn-repo-with-an-external-to-a-given-url">How to find all entries in SVN repo with an external to a given URL [duplicate]</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5118320/find-paths-with-svnexternal-properties-with-certain-string">Find paths with svn:external properties with certain string?</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14213152/get-all-projects-in-svn-that-have-svnexternals-to-a-certain-repository">Get all projects in SVN that have svn:externals to a certain repository</a></li> </ul>  <hr>  <p><sup>1</sup> Pegging revisions, a.k.a.
