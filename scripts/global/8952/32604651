<p>I have a shared library of which the header file contains two stuctures</p>  <pre><code>typedef struct { int check; } test_ts;  typedef struct { test_ts new_s; } new_ts; </code></pre>  <p>So I load the library in Matlab and try to create a structure pointer to the shared library, like below</p>  <pre><code>libMasterStruct = libstruct('test_ts'); </code></pre>  <p>This works perfectly, where as the below doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>libMasterStruct = libstruct('new_ts'); </code></pre>  <p>I know this is because of the nested structure within, is there any way i can make this work?</p>
