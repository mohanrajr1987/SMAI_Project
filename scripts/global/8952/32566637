<p>I'm deploying applications to a WAS 8.5 and wanted to configure multiple shared libraries.</p>  <p>In my case, I want some specific applications to use shared library LibraryA version 1. All other applications on the server must use shared library LibraryA version 2. Is there a way to configure a default shared library and override this configuration for just some applications?</p>  <p>I've searched documentation <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tcws_sharedlib.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tcws_sharedlib.html</a> and found out that each application can specify which isolated shared libraries that it wants to reference. I don't want to specify the shared lib for each application, just for few ones.</p>
