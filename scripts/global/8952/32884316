<p>I have built some example c++ application using gcc 4.9.2 (libstdc++.so.6.0.20). I can run that program on a virtual machine which is equipped with gcc 4.6.3 ((libstdc++.so.6.0.16). Sometimes an application can't be run on the environment which differ from the build environment (for example libstdc++.so.6.0.16 vs libstdc++.so.6.0.20). When a program has to link to libstdc++ version which is using on build machine ? Could you give me some examples (with source code) ?</p>
