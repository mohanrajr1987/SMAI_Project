<p>I am compiling a dynamically generated C++ file as shared object which contains references to symbols available only in it's full build.</p>  <pre><code>g++ -o tmp_form.so -fPIC -shared -lsomelib -std=gnu99 tmp_form.cc </code></pre>  <p>I don't need the missing symbols for my current program, only those from the linked library. But dlopen does require them to be available or fails otherwise. The missing symbols are all variables which are being referenced in structs.</p>  <p>One option would be to add the weak reference attribute to the missing symbols in the generated code. But I would like to avoid making changes to the code generator if possible.</p>  <p>Any advise is appreciated.</p>
