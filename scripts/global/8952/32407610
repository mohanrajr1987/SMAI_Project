<p>The Teigha documentation lists two sample applications, OdPdfExportEx  and OdaMfcApp, which "show how to use PDF export features in client applications". However, the code which I downloaded from their site does not have them!</p>  <p>Indeed, the documentation claims that these apps are "located in Core\Examples\OdPdfExportEx" but there is no such directory in Core\Examples.</p>  <p>Additionally, the documentation refers to something called  ODAProjectFileGenerator.exe which seems to have something to do with it, but I can't find it either.</p>  <p>I've built the solution but it did not generate any of those files, as I hoped it might do.</p>
