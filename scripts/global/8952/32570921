<p>I am looking for the equivalent feature of using shared libraries in Glassfish 4.1 that is found in Weblogic (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E21764_01/web.1111/e13706/libraries.htm#WLPRG325" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E21764_01/web.1111/e13706/libraries.htm#WLPRG325</a>).  </p>  <p>The shared libraries is an EAR packaged with EJBs and JPAs. Several applications need to be deployed in the same glassfish domain with references to the shared library. I want to avoid using remote JNDI calls--I can already do that.  Is anyone familiar with documentation on how to do this?</p>
