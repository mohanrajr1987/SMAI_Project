<p>Say you have plain text input. Within that text you have key words to look for. Say 'cost', 'location' and 'materials' you want to filter out the words that come after these key words so you can store them later in DB under columns with those key words.</p>  <p>How would you do that? I was thinking of converting the string to an array then searching that and using the key value to work out the ranges of words between the key words. This is just an idea anyone got any better one?</p>  <p>Example input:</p>  <pre><code>Cost £45 Materials glue, plastic, wood and nails Location Sale, Manchester North England. </code></pre>  <p>Content the grouped like this in vars:</p>  <pre><code>$cost = "£45"; $materials = "glue, plastic, wood and nails"; $location = "Sale, Manchester North England"; </code></pre>
