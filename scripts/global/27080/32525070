<p>I want to convert a URL to regular expression to match it with current URL. For example, I have a URL <strong><a href="http://www.example.com/example.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/example.php</a></strong> I want it to convert to  <strong>^(https?://)?(www\.)?example\.com\/example\.php/?(\?.<em>)?(#.</em>)?$</strong></p>  <p>So that I store it and whenever a user hits this url with any number of parameters attached to it, I will match that url with my regular expression and will perform some action based on the results.</p>  <p>I have found many questions but they all are either to match general URL (with any domain name) or with regular expressions given. But I want a function to which I will pass URL and it will return its regular expression and I will use it to match that specific domain.</p>
