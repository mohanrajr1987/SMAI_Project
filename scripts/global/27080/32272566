<p>I am trying to match some text with mb_ereg_match of php and I am using this piece of regex to match all non Word chats:</p>  <pre><code>/[^-\w.]|[_]/u </code></pre>  <p>I want to be able to look up unicode chars that's why I am using mb_ereg. With this input:</p>  <pre><code>'γιωρ;γος.gr' </code></pre>  <p>Which containes chars from Greek alphabet. I want to match the ';' and if it is matched to return -1 else return the input.<br /> Whatever I do it doesn't match the ';' and returns the input.<br /> I tried to use preg_match but it doesn't work as I work.<br /> Any suggestions?</p>  <p><strong>Edit 1</strong><br /> I did a test and I found that it matches corectly if I convert my input to:</p>  <pre><code>';γος.gr' </code></pre>  <p>Also works fine with latin chars.</p>  <p><strong>Edit 2</strong> <br /> If I get one of the following I want to print -1.</p>  <pre><code>'γιωρ;γος.gr' ';γος.gr' 'γιωρ;.gr' ';.gr' </code></pre>  <p>Else I want to get whatever the input is.</p>  <p><strong>Edit 3</strong> <br /> I did some more tests and it doesn't match any special char that is surounded of utf-8 chars.</p>
