<p>I'm having an issue with my register page, <strong>i noticed that people can register with alt codes like this "ªµµª"</strong> and i tried to fix it by using preg_replace but when i did that i couldn't register anymore, atleast not with the worldwide alphabet</p>  <pre><code>    final public function validName($username)   {     if(strlen($username) &lt;= 25 &amp;&amp; ctype_alnum($username))        {                    return true;             }                     return false;    }        </code></pre>  <p>Tried to fix it by replacing it with this</p>  <pre><code>if(strlen($username) &lt;= 25 &amp;&amp; preg_match("/[^a-zA-Z0-9]+/", $username)) </code></pre>  <p>But i'm obviously doing something wrong...</p>
