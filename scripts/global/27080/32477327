<p>I'm working on some data loaded from an Excel file using PHPExcel. Everything is working fine with every fields but I'm having some troubles with a field which should contain a pattern.</p>  <p>The pattern is </p>  <pre><code>(([0-2]?[0-9]\:[0-5]?[0-9]\:([0-5]?[0-9])\/([0-2]?[0-9]\:[0-5]?[0-9]\:([0-5]?[0-9])))\s?)* </code></pre>  <p>that should check for time intervals such as "00:30:45/01:40:12 01:10:34/1:07:12" and so on.</p>  <p>My problem is that preg_match fails to check this pattern against the sting "1:00". If I add a variable to store the matches returns an one element array with the value "".</p>  <p>I check the pattern with an online tool (<a href="http://regexpal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://regexpal.com/</a>) and work as expected but for an to me unknown reason, preg_match doesn't.</p>  <p>Is there something I am missing?</p>
