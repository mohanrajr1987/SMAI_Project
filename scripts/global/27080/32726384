<p>I have several HTML pages with codes that look like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!-- ID: 123456 --&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I need is a PHP script that can pull that ID number. I have tried the following:</p>  <pre><code>if (preg_match('#^&lt;!--(.*?)--&gt;#i', $output)) {                 echo "A match was found.";             } else {                 echo array_flip(get_defined_constants(true)['pcre'])[preg_last_error()];                 echo "No match found.";             }` </code></pre>  <p>That always gives "No match found", with no error reported. I have also tried the preg_match_all and the same results. The only thing I have found to work is to create an array based on spaces, but that is very time consuming and waste of processor power.</p>  <p>For reference, I have looked and tried just about every suggestion on these pages:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1792950/explode-string-by-one-or-more-spaces-or-tabs">Explode string by one or more spaces or tabs</a></p>  <p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-split.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-split.php</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6051485/how-to-extract-html-comments-and-all-html-contained-by-node">How to extract html comments and all html contained by node?</a></p>
