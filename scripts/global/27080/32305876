<p>I have a function which uses preg_match to check for if a substring is in another string. Today I realize that if substring has trailing special characters like special regular expression characters (. \ + * ? [ ^ ] $ ( ) { } = ! &lt; > | : -) or @, my preg_match can't find the substring even though it is there.</p>  <p>This works, returns "A match was found."</p>  <pre><code>$find = "website scripting"; $string =  "PHP is the website scripting language of choice.";  if (preg_match("/\b" . $find . "\b/i", $string)) {     echo "A match was found."; } else {     echo "A match was not found."; } </code></pre>  <p>But this doesn't, returns "A match was not found."</p>  <pre><code>$find = "website scripting @"; $string =  "PHP is the website scripting @ language of choice.";  if (preg_match("/\b" . $find . "\b/i", $string)) {     echo "A match was found."; } else {     echo "A match was not found."; } </code></pre>  <p>I have tried preg_quote, but it doesn't help.</p>  <p>Thank you for any suggestions!</p>  <p>Edit: Word boundary is required, that's why I use \b. I don't want to find "phone" in "smartphone".</p>
