<p>I know that question has been asked more than once but even after several tries thanks to the pieces of information I had seen in the other topics I still can't execute the following preg_match regex due to this error message: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning: preg_match(): Unknown modifier '/' in C:..../blabla.php"</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  if (preg_match('/&lt;ns3:contenu xmlns:ns3="http://www.blabla.fr/bla/bla/bla/bla/bla/bla"&gt;?(.*)?&lt;\/ns3:contenu&gt;/', $fileContent, $matches))      {         $content = $matches [1];         var_dump($content);     } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have to escape the "/" characters but I can't manage to get a result when I try.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance,</p>  <p>Augustin.</p>
