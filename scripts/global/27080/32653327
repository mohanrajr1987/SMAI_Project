<p>I have a little problem with getting some numbers from a string.</p>  <p>For example I have this kind of str:</p>  <pre><code>qweqeqe (qweqwe) AASD 213,21 ( -1201,77 EUR ) </code></pre>  <p>I need the numbers with comma that are between brackets Result: <code>-1201,77</code> The value also can be positive. I have already managed to get float value, but from all string. I have this: <code>!\d+(?:\,\d+)?!</code> but it gets all numbers in a str.</p>
