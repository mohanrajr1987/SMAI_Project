<p>I'm trying to get a part of my url using PHP preg_match but it's not working. I followed some instructions but no luck.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far.</p>  <pre><code>$url = 'http://chris.mydomain.com/d/3542re6s/somthing.html'; $pattern = '/\/\/(sub1\.)?mydomain.com\/(\d+)($|\/)/'; preg_match($pattern, $url, $matches); if (count($matches)){   return $matches[2]; } </code></pre>  <p>I also need it to validate for chris, terry and jack only. </p>  <p>UPDATED:</p>  <p>eg: chris.mydomain.com terry.mydomain.com jack.mydomain.com</p>  <p>And I need to get the second query</p>  <p>eg:</p>  <p>chris.mydomain.com/d/3542re6s/somthing.html</p>  <p>would return</p>  <p>3542re6s</p>  <p>Any help is very much appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance C</p>
