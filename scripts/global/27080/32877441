<p>I have Googled and looked at a lot of threads on this subject but none answers this issue for me. I have even copied several different filter strings that do the same thing into do my simple validation. They all work on www.functions-online.com/preg_match.htm but none of them are working in my if() statement.</p>  <p>PHP ver. 5.3.3 My code to allow for only Alpha-Numaric and spaces: </p>  <pre><code>  $myString = 'My Terrific Game';   if (!preg_match('/^[a-z0-9\s]+$/i', $myString)) { "$errorMessage } </code></pre>  <p>I have even reduced the filter to '/^[a-z]+$/' and the test string to 'mytarrificgame' and it still returns zero. It's as if preg_match() isn't functioning at all.</p>  <p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>
