<p>So I am trying to determine if someone is using a temporary email made by our system. If a user tries to login with a social account (Twitter / Facebook) and they decline access to email I generate an email for our system which is AccountID@facebook.com or AccountID@twitter.com so an example would be 123456789@facebook.com. This is a temporary email until a user enters a real email. I am trying to compare this using regex.</p>  <pre><code>    if (preg_match("/^[0-9]@twitter.com/", Auth::user()-&gt;email, $matches)) {     } </code></pre>  <p>However I think my regex is incorrect. How would one check if the format of a string is N Number of digits followed by @twitter.com or @facebook.com</p>
