<p>I've been wrapping my head around this for days now, but nothing seems to give the desired result.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>$var = "Some Words - Other Words (More Words) Dash-Binded-Word"; </code></pre>  <p>Desired result:</p>  <pre><code>array( [0] =&gt; Some Words [1] =&gt; Other Words [2] =&gt; More Words [3] =&gt; Dash-Bound-Word ) </code></pre>  <p>I was able to get this all working using preg_match_all, but then the "Dash-Bound-Word" was broken up as well. Trying to match it with surrounding spaces didn't work as it would break all the words except the dash bound ones.</p>  <p>The preg_match_all statement I used (which broke up the dash bound words too) is this:</p>  <pre><code>preg_match_all('#\(.*?\)|\[.*?\]|[^?!\-|\(|\[]+#', $var, $array); </code></pre>  <p>I'm certainly no expert on preg_match, preg_split so any help here would be greatly appreciated.</p>
