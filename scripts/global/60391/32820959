<p>So yeah, I need the camera to be shaded except in this particular rectangle.</p>  <p>Also, after the photo is taken, I need all the shaded parts of the photo to be disregarded and only the part in the rectangle to be intact.</p>  <p>So far I have implemented my camera instance and I am able to make the shaded background using <code>android:background="#88000000"</code> in my <em>surfaceView</em>, but I can't make that transparent rectangle in the middle.</p>  <p>What is the best approach towards that guys? Any help is appreciated.</p>
