<p>After this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32396177/warp-texture-with-opengles">Warp texture with opengles</a> I tried to unwrap donut shape texture to a rectangular. but I have some problems to do this.</p>  <p>To decide the enter, inner radius, outer radius of the donut shape I took a screenshot of the current camera preview and got the actual bitmap/jpg file. Then pick each coordinates for calculating above values then normalize it for texture.</p>  <p>But in Android the Camera Preview is not 1:1 ratio so my screenshot size like 1920x1080 etc..</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O4N1i.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O4N1i.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>As you see the donut shape looks just a circle not an ellipse.. but the radius for actual warping is different at horizontal and vertical so when I warp it the result is weired. But If i choose the camera preview in 1:1(I'm using galaxy s6 for this and it supports 1:1 preview size(1088, 1088)) and it correctly warp.</p>  <p>My question is how to get the correct radius? or Is there any different way to warp it in not 1:1 aspect ratio or do I have to only use the camera preview that has 1:1 ratio?  Thanks in advance.</p>
