<p>I'm trying to capture images with 30 seconds exposure times in my app (I know it's possible since the stock camera allows it).</p>  <p>But SENSOR_INFO_EXPOSURE_TIME_RANGE (which it's supposed to be in nanoseconds) gives me the range :</p>  <pre><code>13272 - 869661901 </code></pre>  <p>in seconds it would be just</p>  <pre><code>0.000013272 - 0.869661901 </code></pre>  <p>Which obviously is less than a second.</p>  <p>How can I use longer exposure times?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!.</p>
