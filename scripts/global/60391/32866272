<p>I know there are many threads in relation to this topic as to how to customize the size of the window/frame of the camera (Is aspect ratio the correct term?) that shows preview of the image/environment before committing it (or clicking it) as an image. </p>  <p>I have tried <a href="http://android.okhelp.cz/java_android_code.php?s=setPreviewSize" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11121963/how-can-i-set-camera-preview-size-to-squared-aspect-ratio-in-a-squared-surfacevi">this</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21404429/setpreviewsize-bug-in-android">this</a>,<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2751420/why-camera-setparameterscamera-parameters-does-not-work-on-sony-ericsson-x10-a">this</a> &amp; especially another one from user Carlos, link for which I am unable to retrieve.</p>  <p>Thing is i just know the following lines of codes:</p>  <pre><code> camera.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {         @Override         public void onClick(View v) {              Intent cam = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);             startActivityForResult(cam, CAMERA_REQUEST);         }      });    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {     if (requestCode == CAMERA_REQUEST) {         Bitmap photo = (Bitmap) data.getExtras().get("data");         thumbView.setImageBitmap(photo);           }     } </code></pre>  <p>That's it. I have tried typing from above links inside <code>onCreate()</code> but I have no clue. </p>  <p>Please guide from basics as to what will help me achieve a camera screen with a contracted square frame?</p>
