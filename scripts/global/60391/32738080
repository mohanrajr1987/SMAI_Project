<p>I have an android app in which the screen orientation is set to portrait in manifest file. It uses a custom camera in b/w , to take a photo and I need to save the photo.</p>  <p>Before I save the image I have to rotate the image depending on how the user is holding the camera, so that the image gets saved in the right orientation. </p>  <p>So, is there any way by which I can get the device orientation even when my app is running in portrait mode and android "auto-rotation" feature is ON. How can I achieve this?</p>
