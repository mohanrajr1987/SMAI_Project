<p>I am using mediaRecorder and camera to try and record a video, following the guide at <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html</a></p>  <p>On the mediaRecorder I set sources, set file, prep, and start the camera...which all works great.</p>  <p>I then call mediaRecorder.stop, which according to the guide is the first call you make during the stop process, and the application just hangs. No error, no exceptions, nada.</p>  <p>It's wrapped in a try/catch and nothing is thrown or caught.</p>  <pre><code>    Log.d(TAG, "try mediaRecorder stop");     try { mMediaRecorder.stop(); }     catch (Exception e) {...} </code></pre>  <p>logcat doesn't seem to have anything useful either</p>  <pre><code>09-18 08:34:28.079  D/MyCameraApp﹕ **try mediaRecorder stop** 09-18 08:34:28.273  D/jdwp﹕ processIncoming 09-18 08:34:28.273  D/jdwp﹕ handlePacket : cmd=0x1, cmdSet=0xC7, len=0x14, id=0x40001414, flags=0x0, dataLen=0x9 09-18 08:34:28.273  D/jdwp﹕ sendBufferedRequest : len=0x34 09-18 08:34:28.774  D/jdwp﹕ processIncoming ...repeat same messages forever... 09-18 08:34:43.374  I/AndroidRuntime﹕ VM exiting with result code 1, cleanup skipped. </code></pre>  <p>When I view fileManager the video is indeed created and its size grows based on how long I left it alone before killing the app. If I try to open the video I get "Can't play this video" error.</p>  <p>Why is the application hanging up? I can't find a way to even see any useful error messages.</p>  <p>--start camera code incase I'm doing something wrong here--</p>  <pre><code>    mCamera.unlock();     mMediaRecorder.setCamera(mCamera);      mMediaRecorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.CAMCORDER);     mMediaRecorder.setVideoSource(MediaRecorder.VideoSource.CAMERA);      mMediaRecorder.setProfile(CamcorderProfile.get(1));     mMediaRecorder.setOutputFile(getOutputMediaFile(MEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO).toString());      try { mMediaRecorder.prepare(); }     catch (IOException e) {...}     catch (IllegalStateException e) {...}      try { mMediaRecorder.start(); }     catch (Exception e) {...} </code></pre>  <p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>  <p>I have tried resetting device and adding a release to caught errors, still no clue where or why it might be failing.</p>  <p>Still no dice, any clues on how I can even attempt to get more information? About where/why it's crashing? </p>  <p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>  <p>I have tried on another device and am getting an illegalstateexception during mediarecorder start. Perhaps this sheds some light onto the issue? I opened another question since I'm not positive the two are the same: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32694810/android-video-recording-illegalstateexception-on-mediarecorder-start">Android video recording - IllegalStateException on mediaRecorder.start</a></p>
