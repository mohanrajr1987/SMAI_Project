<p>I have an android app, which doesn't work with audio or music player, but it can take pictures from my custom wrapper around Camera class and from calling MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE intent, but sometimes, when I try to open this intent my mediaplayer in background starts to play music! If I leave and enter this Intent again my music "pauses", so looks like switching to this Intent switches my music! Why does it happen?</p>  <p>here is how I start intent, just like in tutorial (<a href="http://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html</a>):</p>  <pre><code>private void dispatchTakePictureIntent() {     releaseCameras(); //here I clear all reserved shared cameras     Intent takePictureIntent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);     if (takePictureIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {         startActivityForResult(takePictureIntent, REQUEST_IMAGE_CAPTURE);     } } </code></pre>
