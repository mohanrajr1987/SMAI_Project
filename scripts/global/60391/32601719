<p>I'm working on a custom camera app for Android.  The camera is windowed (NOT fullscreen).  So far, it's working pretty well in that I can see a camera preview, take photos &amp; video, switch cameras (front &amp; back).  However, what I need is when the device is in portrait mode, I need my SurfaceView to be landscape along with the photos taken.  Right now, on my test device, I have a SurfaceView set to an aspect of 5:3, with a supported preview size of 800x480 (also 5:3).  BUT, the camera preview looks stretched horizontally AND the photos taken end up 480x800 (3:5 aspect).</p>  <p>Is there any way to force the camera to take the photos as 800x480 while the device is in portrait mode, such that the camera preview is also a scaled version of 800x480?</p>  <p>Environment: Android Studio 1.3.1 on OSX 10.10 Targeting API 15-23</p>  <p>Using Camera API, NOT Camera2.</p>
