<p>In My app I am taking picture using the Native android camera app. I am taking picture and then fetching this picture making some changes in it and then again on user interaction I am saving picture into the gallery inside my app folder.</p>  <p>But after doing this I have seen that camera is also saving the picture in the camera roll folder. So in this way there are two pictures saved in the end. One which is taken by the camera and other which is loaded and edited by the user and saved by the user. </p>  <p>So can this be done that camera skip to the save the picture permanently, so and still I am be able to fetch the picture captured by the camera and after making change it should be saved. So in this way only one picture would be saved. </p>  <p><strong>What I have done so far</strong> well there is no need to show some code as I am taking suggestion but I am sharing some part of relevant coding which is showing how I am fetching picture from the gallery after taking picture through camera. </p>  <pre><code>@Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {     super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);      if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {          switch (requestCode) {              case REQUEST_CODE_HIGH_QUALITY_IMAGE:                   if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {                     Intent mediaScanIntent = new Intent(                             Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE);                     Uri contentUri = Uri.fromFile(output); //out is your output file                     mediaScanIntent.setData(contentUri);                     this.sendBroadcast(mediaScanIntent);                     //  sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE, mHighQualityImageUri));                      //refreshing gallery                     Intent mediaScanIntentKitKat = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE);                     mediaScanIntentKitKat.setData(Uri.fromFile(output));                     sendBroadcast(mediaScanIntentKitKat);                      Intent intentActivityKitKat = new Intent(MyCameraActivity.this, PhotoEdititngActivity.class);                     intentActivityKitKat.putExtra("data", Uri.fromFile(output));                      startActivity(intentActivityKitKat);                 } else {                     sendBroadcast(new Intent(                             Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED,                             Uri.parse("file://"                                     + Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory())));                      //refreshing gallery                     Intent mediaScanIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE);                     mediaScanIntent.setData(Uri.fromFile(output));                     sendBroadcast(mediaScanIntent);                      Intent intentActivity = new Intent(MyCameraActivity.this, PhotoEditingActivity.class);                     intentActivity.putExtra("data", Uri.fromFile(output));                     Log.v("Uri before Sending", Uri.fromFile(output) + "");                     startActivity(intentActivity);                 }                   break; </code></pre>  <p>so this is how I am loading picture and then taking it to the other activity. </p>  <p><strong>> What I want ?</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>I want to know How can I cure my picture to be saved two times , one   by the camera and other after editing ?  Please share me some ideas   and show me some code if you have done this before ::</p> </blockquote>
