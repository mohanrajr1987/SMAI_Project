<p>I'm trying to build an app which will periodically call the Camera to take a picture and save it. My problem is that unless I put the 'takePictuce' call in the 'onCreate' the response to 'takePicture' (onPictureTaken) is never called.</p>  <p>I've broken down the app as simply as possible to illustrate.</p>  <p>if a class to handle the camera is partially defined as:</p>  <pre><code>public class CameraHandler {     private Camera mCamera;      public CameraHandler(){         mCamera = Camera.open();         mCamera.setPreviewTexture(new SurfaceTexture(10));          mCamera.startPreview();         mCamera.takePicture(null, null, mPicture);     }      Camera.PictureCallback mPicture = new Camera.PictureCallback() {         @Override         public void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) {             File pictureFile = getOutputMediaFile();             if (pictureFile == null) {                 return;             }             try {                 FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pictureFile);                 fos.write(data);                 fos.close();             } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {             } catch (IOException e) {            }         }     }; </code></pre>  <p>Then when I put the following code into MainActivity.java, 'onPictureTaken' IS called when CameraHandler is instantiated.</p>  <pre><code>@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);     setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);     CameraHandler cameraHandler = new CameraHandler(); } </code></pre>  <p>However, putting the call to instantiate CameraHandler in a click event in the MainActivity.java will NOT call 'onPictureTaken' in response to the takePicture call.</p>  <pre><code>(This snippet is located in MainACtivity.java)   public void onClickListener(View view){         CameraHandler cameraHandler = new CameraHandler(); } </code></pre>  <p>So why is this occurring, and how can I get the call to take a picture in the class where it belongs and not in the 'main' of the program?</p>  <p>All help welcome</p>
