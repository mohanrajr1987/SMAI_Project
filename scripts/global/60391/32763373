<p>Video is recorded when Android phone is in portrait mode.The preview and viewing the recorded video on the phone are all normal by using Camera.setDisplayOrientation and MediaRecorder.setOrientationHint.(Many solutions provided to similar problem just go here.)</p>  <p>The problem is our player using to play the uploaded video doesn't support the orientation composition matrix. I know we can change the player or convert the video before playing it. But is there a good solution when recording the video?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
