<p>I am new to android and have managed to run my app where I can use the camera to capture the image. However I want to know the best solution to store and retrieve the images.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Is it good to store the images in SQLlite or External Memory</p></li> <li><p>Can I store the image with multiple comma separated names in sqllite and then retrieve it as per those names.</p></li> </ol>  <p>For e.g. I have a capture button where I can click to capture an image and then if the image is okay i can press next where it shows me a text box and save button. In the text box I can enter multiple  names of image say - x1, x2, x3 etc. and then i want to retrieve the image by using any of these names.</p>  <p>any good idea will be much appreciated.</p>
