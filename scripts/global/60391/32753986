<p>I want to built my own camera app in android including the following options pinch to zoom and autofocus without using camera intent. I already gone through some samples from Git hub but I couldn't make use of them.So, I decided to start learning Camera API from Google developers. Here I need a complete steps to develop my app and what to learn like camera,  surface view and anything else.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
