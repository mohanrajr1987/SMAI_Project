<p>I am developing a android camera application to record videos. My application was working well in other devices but it failed on the Samsung s3 mini (GT-I8200Q). As I stated in the header, camera preview is frozen and video recording is failed. When the app is not recording preview is working well.</p>  <p>I am choosing the preview size 800*640 to keep the aspect ratio well. It is working below 800*640 sizes. However it is failing above the 800*640 such as(720*480 and 1280*720).</p>  <p>What could be the reason? Or is it just a device specific error. </p>  <p>By the way there is no info on the LogCat.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
