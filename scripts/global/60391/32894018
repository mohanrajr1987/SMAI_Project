<p>I am developing an app for the Samsung Galaxy Camera 2. Unlike most android devices, this device has a hardware button to open and close the camera's flash. I would like the app to tell the user to open the flash before they take a picture, if the flash mode is on.  However i can not detect if the camera's flash is opened or closed. The flash button does not register as a key event so I do not know how else to detect when this hardware button is being used. </p>
