<p>The below code exports data correctly however my <code>debug.print</code> line always gives  -1. I would like to retrieve the count of rows in <code>debug.print</code> statement. Please suggest what is wrong.</p>  <pre><code>Sub TEST()          Dim rs As Object         Dim iCols As Integer         Set rs = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")         On Error GoTo ERR         Dim SQLSTR As String, MYVAL As String         MYVAL = InputBox("Enter Query")         SQLSTR = " " &amp; MYVAL &amp; ""         CONNECT_TO_DWHS         rs.Open SQLSTR, PERSONALDBCONT              For iCols = 0 To rs.Fields.Count - 1                 ActiveSheet.Cells(1, iCols + 1).Value = rs.Fields(iCols).Name             Next          Debug.Print rs.RecordCount         ActiveSheet.Cells(2, 1).CopyFromRecordset rs         ActiveSheet.Cells(1, 1).Select          CLOSE_CONNECTION_TO_SQL              With ActiveWindow                 .SplitColumn = 0                 .SplitRow = 1                 .FreezePanes = True             End With          Exit Sub     ERR:         CLOSE_CONNECTION_TO_SQL         MsgBox "There was an error"    End Sub </code></pre>
