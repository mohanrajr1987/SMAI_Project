<p>Hey I have scoured the forum for something similar to this, but can't quite find anything. I am trying to get a conversion percentage, so a count from the bottom of funnel divided by a count from top of funnel. These two counts live on two separate tables in my database that are not joinable. </p>  <p>I wrote this code but keep getting 0 when I know it should not be 0</p>  <pre><code>SELECT ((( SELECT COUNT(p.id) FROM partner_subscriptions AS p) / ( SELECT COUNT(a.id) FROM salesforce_leads AS a)) * 100) as percentage </code></pre>
