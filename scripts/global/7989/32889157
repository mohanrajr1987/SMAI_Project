<p>I was trying to count the occurrences of words which end with several suffixes. I thought that <code>endswith</code> would accept an iterable; unfortunately, it did not. Below is the code snippet:</p>  <pre><code>s = 'like go goes likes liked liked liking likes like' lst = s.split() suffixes = ['s', 'es', 'ies', 'ed', 'ing']  counter = 0 prompt = 'like' for x in lst:     if x.startswith(prompt) and x.endswith(any(suffix for suffix in suffixes)):          counter += 1 </code></pre>  <p>The value of <code>counter</code> should be <code>4</code> at the end of the execution. This is the error message which is displayed:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: endswith first arg must be str or a tuple of str, not bool </code></pre>  <p>How can I get the above code to work?</p>
