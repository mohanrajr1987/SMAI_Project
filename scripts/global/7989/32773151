<p>I dont know if is possible with single query.</p>  <p>Here is my table:</p>  <pre><code>id  name        body ------------------------------ 1   Toyota      SUV 2   Mazda       Sedan 3   Crysler     Wagon 4   Mercedes    Van 5   Merceds     SUV 6   Mazda       SUV  etc... </code></pre>  <p>and here is the query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT    name,   COUNT(name) AS make_total,   COUNT(body) AS body_total  FROM   cars  GROUP BY name; </code></pre>  <p>If I group by name "make_total" is correct, if I group by body than "body_total" count is correct, but never the both.</p>  <p>The expected result should produce correct count for each name and body fields.</p>
