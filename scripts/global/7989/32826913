<p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>$host = "localhost"; $user = "root"; $pw = "";  $dbName = "mathgame"; $tblName = "fragen"; // mit mysql db verbinden  $con = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $pw, $dbName); if ($con-&gt;connect_error) { die ("Connection failed: " . $con-&gt;connect_error);}  // Datenanfrage an db  $result = mysqli_query($con, "select id from $tblName"); $array = mysqli_fetch_array($result); echo count($array["id"]); </code></pre>  <p>Comments are in German, but I think you get what the program does. So my problem is, that there are 8 "elements" in the fragen table. But when I count the array it returns one. What did I do wrong?</p>
