<p>I have a "Assessment Test" form in my website where users answers some questions with 4 options (and only 1 is correct)</p>  <p>I have 3 tables:</p>  <p>Users, Questions and Answers.</p>  <p>I need to know the total of correct answers "ALL COMPANY" and "by groups" - like Business Unit (Marketing, Sales..)</p>  <p>This is the syntax:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT  COUNT(DISTINCT ANSWERS.USERID) as TOTAL, sum(case when ANSWERS.A1 = QUESTIONS.CORRECT AND ANSWERS.LAST = 16 AND QUESTIONS.QUESTIONNUM = 1 then 1 else 0 end) TOTALANSWERS1, sum(case when ANSWERS.A2 = QUESTIONS.CORRECT AND ANSWERS.LAST = 16 AND QUESTIONS.QUESTIONNUM = 2 then 1 else 0 end) TOTALANSWERS2, </code></pre>  <p>... until 16..</p>  <pre><code>FROM QUESTIONS INNER JOIN ANSWERS ON QUESTIONS.QUESTIONGROUP = 1 INNER JOIN USERS ON USERS.USERID = ANSWERS.USERID WHERE ANSWERS.LAST = 16 AND USERS.BU = 'SALES' ORDER BY USERS.ID DESC </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>ANSWERS.LAST = Is the number of the Last Question completed. (the form has 16 questions, then with this I just count completed assessments)</p>  <p>QUESTIONS.CORRECT = Is the correct option of each question ("A", "B", "C" or "D")</p>  <p>QUESTIONS.QUESTIONNUM = Is the question number (1 to 16)</p>  <h2>QUESTIONS.QUESTIONGROUP = 1 (is the "ASSESSMENT ID")</h2>  <p>With this I got the CORRECT TOTAL, but all other totals are incorrect, because they are counting duplicated USERID..</p>  <hr>  <p>TOTAL  TOTALANSWERS1   TOTALANSWERS2</p>  <p>15            16                    18</p>  <hr>  <p>Its wrong.. TOTALANSWERS is bigger than TOTAL..</p>  <p>(TOTAL is the number of correct answer for entire company - TOTALANSWERS1, TOTALANSWERS2.. are the number of correct answer for the business unit "SALES" - part of the company)</p>  <p>If I put a "GROUP BY USERS.USERID"</p>  <p>I got 15 rows in TOTAL with number 1. (correct)</p>  <p>but I got 15 rows on others some with 1 and others with 2 (duplicated USERSID)</p>  <p>How can I make a DISTINCT here?</p>  <p>I try a lot, but always with some SQL error..</p>  <p>tks a lot!</p>
