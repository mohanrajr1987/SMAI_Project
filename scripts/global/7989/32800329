<p>I am trying to get the count of employees in a project but I am stuck on getting the count using the 3 tables. I am able to get the count of employees with the same job but I cant wrap around getting the "total" count of employees with those jobs in that project.</p>  <p>I have 3 tables</p>  <pre><code>employees | job | project </code></pre>  <p>The table employees_ looks like:</p>  <pre><code>emp_id | emp_name | emp_job    1       phil        1    2       scott       4    3       alex        3    4       bob         1    5       dave        2 </code></pre>  <p>The table job_ looks like:</p>  <pre><code>job_id |  job_name  | job_req | proj_id    1     programmer    cert        1    2       manager      ba         1    3       manager       n/a       2    4     programmer     ba         2 </code></pre>  <p>The table project_ looks like:</p>  <pre><code>proj_id | proj_name | proj_info     1        dev1       lalala     2        dev2       tralala </code></pre>  <p>so the query should output</p>  <p>project 1 has a total of 3 employees</p>  <p>project 2 has a total of 2 employees </p>  <ul> <li>edit more info added below i have also added some table data above.</li> </ul>  <p>i am trying to do this in PHP i have looked up a few examples online and looking at it now they weren't what i needed.</p>  <p>this is the query i am using to count employees with jobs but i need it to be # of employees for said project. I would use a WHERE but thats not how my tables are set up.</p>  <p>// $jon = mysql_query("SELECT COUNT(<code>employee_job</code>) FROM ".DB_EMP." ");         $emp = mysql_free_result($jon);</p>  <p>I was trying to expand this query using  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp</a></p>  <p>with no luck because i now think thats now going to solve my issue.</p>
