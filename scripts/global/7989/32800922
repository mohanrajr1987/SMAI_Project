<p>Counting Definite and Indefinite articles</p>  <p>This is what I have right now. I am new to this and I think i have to do something with array?? So my first question is how to turn the input into a list. </p>  <pre><code>import sys     def main():         indefinite = 0         definite = 0         article = ""          for line in sys.stdin:             line  = line.strip()              for word in line.split():                 if article == 'een' in line:                     indefinite = indefinite + 1                 if article == 'het' in line:                     definite   = definite + 1                 if article == 'de' in line:                      definite   = definite + 1          print(indefinite)         print(definite)     main() </code></pre>
