<p>It's still old school JS week for newbies at the academy.</p>  <p>I have created an input that makes it possible for a user to put some numbers in a input to write out an array.</p>  <p>Now what I'm trying to do next is writing out a paragraph with a counter for each number, like with how many times the number has been used.</p>  <p>If the array was <code>[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2];</code></p>  <p>And I want it to write it out something like this:   </p>  <p>"How many times does your number appears in your array:"<br> 0: 2<br> 1: 3<br> 2: 4   </p>  <p>So far I got it to print out the numbers from the input, but I can't find a way to make it write out like above.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>    var numbers = [];          function numbarray() {         numbers.push(document.getElementById("box").value);              document.getElementById("text1").innerHTML = "";         document.getElementById("text1").innerHTML += numbers.join(", ");              }</code></pre> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>       &lt;input type="text" id="box" placeholder="0-9 with comma" /&gt;        &lt;input type="button" value="Click" onclick="numbarray()" /&gt;        &lt;br&gt;        Your array:&lt;span id="text1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>After tinkering, failing and googling since yesterday morning I've figure I try out SO again, since I've learned more from this site then I could ever imagine.</p>  <p>Thank you so much in advance</p>
