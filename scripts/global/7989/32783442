<p>This web site has been so useful to me for years. There was always the question (and the answer) to my SQL questions. This time, I couldn’t find it. So here is my question:</p>  <p>For a search engine with numerous criteria, I have several columns containing several data / substrings in each.</p>  <p>Say :</p>  <pre><code>Ref    |    application         |        type     |             source _______________________________________________________________________________     A      |      ak, bct, rg-t     |rega, mann, itr  | abc, ghf, eeerr, lam, rmn     B      |      ak                |rega, aze        | null         C      |     rg-t               | null            |         abc, ghf, D      |     ak                 |rega, mann, itr  | abc, ghf, eeerr, lam, rmn     E      |    null                |rega             | lam, rmn </code></pre>  <p>Each code / substring is supposed to be unique</p>  <p>In only one request, I would like to know how many occurrences there is of <code>ak</code>, how many occurrences of <code>bct</code>, how many occurrences of <code>rg-t</code>…</p>  <p>Is there a way that would correspond to:</p>  <pre><code>Select     count(application(ak)),     count(application(bct)),     count(application(rg-t)),    …     count(type(rega)),     count(type(aze)),     …     count(source(abc)),    count(source(eeerr))    … </code></pre>  <p>And would give one line:</p>  <pre><code>3   |1  |2  |…  |4  |1  |…      |3  |2  |… </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
