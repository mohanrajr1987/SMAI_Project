<p>I am new to java and working on a Tip Calculator where I need a counter to determine the tip outcome if there are multiple customers splitting a check. </p>  <p>The output question is stated as</p>  <p>"What was customer  1's bill amount (in dollars)?"</p>  <p>If the user is to enter that there is more than one customer, How would I change the statement to have the output of </p>  <p>"What was customer 2's bill amount (in dollars)?</p>  <p>and so on and so forth.</p>  <p>I have tried to input the counter in the center of my statement to increase the number by one but I keep getting a syntax error. </p>
