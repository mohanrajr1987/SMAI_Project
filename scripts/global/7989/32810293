<p>Ok this is where it gets complicated if you could potentially take a stab at this.</p>  <p>I want to achieve conversion rates based upon quarters. For example, # of subscribers who applied in Q1 2015 / # of applicants in Q1 2015.</p>  <p>I have each grouping but i don't know how to join and divide based upon quarter:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT      cast(EXTRACT(year FROM a.start_at) as varchar)  ||  ' - Q'  ||  cast(EXTRACT(quarter FROM a.start_at) as varchar)  AS "partner_subscriptions.start_quarter",     COUNT(*) AS "partner_subscriptions.count" FROM partner_subscriptions AS a  GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1  LIMIT 500 </code></pre>  <p>/</p>  <pre><code>SELECT      cast(EXTRACT(year FROM o.date_of_partnership_application__c) as varchar)  ||  ' - Q'  ||  cast(EXTRACT(quarter FROM o.date_of_partnership_application__c) as varchar)  AS "salesforce_opportunities.partnership_application_quarter",     COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) AS "salesforce_opportunities.count" FROM salesforce_opportunities AS o   GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 500 </code></pre>
