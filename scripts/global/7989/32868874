<p>I am looping over objects called events. Each event has a particular object in it. I am calculating the fraction of objects that have a particular characteristic. Imagine the approach as being something like the following:</p>  <pre><code>for event in events:     countCars =+ 1     if event.car.isBlue() is True:         countCarsBlue =+ 1  print("fraction of cars that are blue: {fraction}".format(     fraction = countCarsBlue / countCars)) </code></pre>  <p>Now, imagine that I want to calculate the fraction of objects that have the particular characteristic <em>in regions of another of the object's characteristics</em>. So, in my example, I am counting the fraction of cars that are blue. Now, I want to calculate the fraction of cars that are blue in the range of car lengths from 0 m to 1 m, the fraction of cars that are blue in the range of car lengths from 1 m to 2 m, from 2 m to 3 m and from 3 m to 4 m and so on.</p>  <p>Given that I am dealing with a lot of statistics and many more bins than the 4 bins of my simple example, what would be a good way to structure the code for this type of calculation, assuming a constant bin width?</p>  <p>(Would there be a sensible way to do this for <em>variable</em> bin widths?)</p>
