<p>Let's say, that I have a variable which has a random number of words. For example, if variable has 2 words, then it should be <code>echo</code> with one style. If has 3 words, then <code>echo</code> it with other style... etc...</p>  <pre><code>$mywords = "some sentence goes here";  if ... { // what to do next?          echo '&lt;span style="style1"&gt;$mywords&lt;/span&gt;'; }     elseif ... // ? </code></pre>  <p>Ideas on how to accomplish this?</p>
