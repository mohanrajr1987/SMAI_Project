<p>I have to run the following two queries on a Sybase engine:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) AS BTB_YES FROM FXMM_EVT_DBF WHERE M__INTID_ = '1.511' AND M_ISHEDGE = 1 SELECT COUNT(*) AS BTB_NO FROM FXMM_EVT_DBF WHERE M__INTID_ = '1.511' AND M_ISHEDGE = 0 </code></pre>  <p>Since I basically select the same set of information, i.e. : </p>  <pre><code>SELECT M_ISHEDGE FROM FXMM_EVT_DBF WHERE M__INTID_ = '1.511' </code></pre>  <p>and then I count on this column twice with two separate conditions, I kinda feel there is a way to have the result on the same single query, which would be great since the above queries must be run on several databases. </p>  <p>However, I'm being unable to get a joint result, probably because I'm not very good at SQL. My try was: </p>  <pre><code>SELECT M_ISHEDGE FROM FXMM_EVT_DBF WHERE M__INTID_ = '1.511' CASE WHEN M_ISHEDGE = 1     then count(*)     else 0 END AS BTB_YES CASE WHEN M_ISHEDGE = 0     then count(*)     else 0 END AS BTB_NO </code></pre>  <p>but the above fails with the following error: </p>  <pre><code>An error occurred when executing the SQL command: SELECT M_ISHEDGE FROM FXMM_EVT_DBF WHERE M__INTID_ = '1.511' CASE WHEN M_ISHEDGE = 1     then count(*)     else 0 END AS BTB_Y... Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'CASE'. [SQL State=ZZZZZ, DB Errorcode=156]   Execution time: 0s  1 statement(s) failed. </code></pre>  <p>and the SQL editor does not seem to recognize the keyword <code>THEN</code>, although it is part of the documentation, so probably because of some syntax mistake. </p>
