I would like the result to resemble that in the data frame <code>RESULT</code>.</p>  <p>I´m collecting data on patient’s progress (<code>Variable_x</code>) and I want to use the “number of days” variable as the time variable in a mixed model.</p>  <p>Here are the variables: </p>  <pre><code>Id &lt;- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,5,5,5,5,5) Date &lt;- as.Date (c("2015-01-01", "2015-01-10", "2015-01-15","2015-01-25","2013-02-01", "2013-03-20", "2013-04-03","2014-05-06","2014-06-07","2014-06-08","2014-08-09","2014-10-10")) Variable_x &lt;- c("70","NA","55", "30", "70", "60", "NA", "80", "60", "70", "50","20") Days &lt;- c(0,9,14,24,0,47,61,0,32,33,95,157) </code></pre>  <p>Here are the data I have: </p>  <pre><code>DATA &lt;- data.frame(Id, Date, Variable_x) </code></pre>  <p>Here is the data i want: </p>  <pre><code>RESULT &lt;- data.frame(Id, Date, Days, Variable_x) </code></pre>  <p>Hope someone can come up with an answer or point me in the right direction. </p>  <p>Help would be much appreciated.</p>
