<p>Context: This is for a hypothetical car rental company. There are two tables concerned with this question. They are called 'Staff Table' and 'Sale Staff Member Table'. The first table includes information regarding staff members such as DOB and whatnot. The second table includes the following information:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qivk9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qivk9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Staff_ID = The Staff member's unique code Sale_ID = The specific sale's unique code SaleStaffMember_AssociatedWithPurchase = whether or not the staff member was involved with the initial sale or just the return of the car.</p>  <p>The two tables have the same Staff_ID.</p>  <p>I have written the following SQL:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [staff table].staff_id as [Staff ID], Count([sale staff member table].staff_id) AS [Number of Rentals] FROM [staff table] LEFT JOIN [sale staff member table] ON [sale staff member table].staff_id = [staff table].staff_id WHERE [sale staff member table].staff_id IS NULL or [sale staff member table].staff_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY [staff table].staff_id </code></pre>  <p>What this does is that it lists every staff member (some staff members have not made any sales and hence are not in the sale staff member table) and beside them it lists the amount of sales they have made:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J6ahF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J6ahF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My issue is that the staff member pointed to here has technically NOT made any sales, however he is listed as having made 1 when he should have 0. I understand why, as i have not written anything concerning the associated with purchase field in the SQL. I tried doing so and the furthest I could get was completely removing that member from the query result. However, what I want to do is essentially say:</p>  <p>'If the staff member is not associated with the purchase, do not include this specific entry in the count'</p>  <p>But I have no idea how to do so. I tried a few ridiculous solutions and looked this up but I ultimately could not find a solution. I'm sure it's relatively simple, but I've just picked up SQL over the past few days so I do not know yet.</p>  <p>Edit: Just realised my where statement literally does nothing haha, but that doesn't solve anything, it just makes the code a bit neater:</p>  <p>my revised code:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [staff table].staff_id as [Staff ID], Count([sale staff member table].staff_id) AS [Number of Rentals] FROM [staff table] LEFT JOIN [sale staff member table] ON [sale staff member table].staff_id = [staff table].staff_id GROUP BY [staff table].staff_id </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>Edit: FINAL ANSWER</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [Staff Table].Staff_ID AS [Staff ID], SSM.[Number of Rentals] AS [Number of Rentals] FROM [staff table]  LEFT JOIN (SELECT Staff_ID, nz(COUNT(Staff_ID),0) as [Number of Rentals]  FROM [Sale Staff Member Table]  WHERE SaleStaffMember_AssociatedWithPurchase = 1 GROUP BY Staff_ID) AS SSM ON [Staff Table].Staff_ID = SSM.Staff_ID </code></pre>
