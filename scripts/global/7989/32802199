<p>Here is some part of my code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php                 $terning1 = rand(1,6);                 $terning2 = rand(1,6);                 $terning3 = rand(1,6);                 $terning4 = rand(1,6);                 $terning5 = rand(1,6);                 $terning6 = rand(1,6); //Here i need a system to check how many of them that gets number 6 ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>soo what i need is way to check how many of $terning1-6 that returns the number 6. lets say $terning1 and $terning4 is  then i need a way to tell me that 2 of them are 6. i dont know how i can do this as ive never done something like that before.</p>
