<p>I'm a bit of a noob with dplyr, and I know it's an easy fix. I have data of certain events, "X","Y",and "Z" and a list of dates on which those events occured. An example can be generated by the following:</p>  <pre><code>days.14&lt;-seq(as.Date("2014/1/1"),as.Date("2014/12/31"),by="days") X&lt;-c("X","") Y&lt;-c("Y","") Z&lt;-c("Z","") data&lt;-as.data.frame(sample(days.14,200,replace=TRUE)) data$X&lt;-sample(X,200,replace=TRUE) data$Y&lt;-sample(Y,200,replace=TRUE) data$Z&lt;-sample(Z,200,replace=TRUE) names(data)[1]&lt;-"date" data&lt;-data[order(as.Date(data$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")),] </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to use the dplyr package to take counts for each event grouped by the day. So, rather than a row in the data representing the days where events happened it would be all the days in the data set with the number of times each event happened. So instead of something like this:</p>  <pre><code>2014-01-01     Z 2014-01-01   Y Z 2014-01-01 X 2014-01-02 X Y Z </code></pre>  <p>I'm tryig to use dplyr to get :</p>  <pre><code>  date        X Y Z -------------------- 2014-01-01    1 1 2 2014-01-01    1 1 1 </code></pre>  <p>The code I've used to accomplish this doesn't work for character vectors.</p>  <pre><code>counts = data%&gt;% group_by(factor(date))%&gt;% summarise(X=sum(X), Y=sum(Y), Z=sum(Z)) </code></pre>  <p>The way I usually generate counts is through the table function but that doesn't work for dplyr.</p>
