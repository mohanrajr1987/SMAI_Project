<p><strong>Problem:</strong> <em>I want to know what are the most popular categories based on their records which are assigned to each category</em></p>  <p><strong>Database structure:</strong> </p>  <pre><code>categories.id categories.title  records.id records.category_id records.title records.views </code></pre>  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <em>Let's say there are 1000+ items in <code>records</code> table, which are assigned differently to each categories, and have random number of <code>records.views</code>. I know how to JOIN multiple tables, but I have no idea how to count all views of records in each category and show that.</em></p>  <p><strong>Expected results:</strong> <em>I expect to have output something like this, shown below:</em></p>  <pre><code>CATEGORY #1     id = 21     title = Fruits     views = 381  CATEGORY #2     id = 24     title = Snacks     views = 8875  CATEGORY #3     id = 47     title = Toys     views = 381  CATEGORY #4     id = 25     title = Milky-wilky products     views = 8875 </code></pre>  <p>Any tips how to achieve that ?</p>
