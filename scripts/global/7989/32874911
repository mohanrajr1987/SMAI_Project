<p>I normally work in Access but cannot figure this logic within it. I'm now branching to MySQL in hopes i can do this. </p>  <p>Have table Visits with CUSTOMERID, VISITDATE</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>CUSTOMERID        VISITDATE   1001            7/6/2015       2315            9/1/2015   2315            12/30/2014   9851            5/5/2013   9851            1/7/2014   9851            3/21/2014  </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to add a column called 'Visit Number' so I can label in ascending order each Customer's visitdate as his first, second, etc... </p>  <h2>It would look like:</h2>  <pre><code>CUSTOMERID        VISITDATE      VISITNUMBER   1001            7/6/2015            1   2315            9/1/2015            1   2315            12/30/2014          2   9851            5/5/2013            1   9851            1/7/2014            2   9851            3/21/2014           3  </code></pre>  <p>It's an incrementation based on the ascending dates, but also grouped by CUSTOMERID.</p>  <p>Would seriously appreciate any tips on this. Thanks.</p>
