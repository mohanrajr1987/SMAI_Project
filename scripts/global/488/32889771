<p>I am trying a show a console like screen in the ios app for ongoing current activities. I was able to make the GUI and other process. The data constantly written to a text file and textview parallel. As the textview has a limit to get max characters in its container, I am braking the data into chunks and fetching 10000 characters of old data if scrollbar goes towards top navigaitonbar and latest if goes downwards. The problem is, the scrolling becomes and handling data is difficult. Is there any plugin or working solution which works like xcode log console screen without any issue.</p>
