<p>I have a py2exe-built program which is executed directly from the console (Windows Powershell). Involved modules are: xlrd and PrettyTable.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, each time the program is called, Windows asks the user for a confirmation, as the program would need particular privileges.</p>  <p>This is undesirable as the script is "safe" for the system. It just gets text files as arguments and outputs a text file, in the same folder. I don't want the user to be scared by this permission request.</p>  <p>Is there any way to avoid such behaviour? </p>
