<p>I need some help with my code. Here is how the task looks like:</p>  <p>Develop a console program "Calculator", which reads arithmetic operators in loop iteration,  which user inputs  ("+", "-", "*", "/") and its operands (real numbers), and then calculates,  bringing to Screen result of the operation, which is then used in the next operation as the first operand (as a result, program will be something like a chain of successive calculations). The program must correctly handle errors (division by zero, entering the number instead of  arithmetic operators, etc.) and notify the user, without interrupting the work.</p>  <p>This is what I've got so far:</p>  <pre><code>Console.WriteLine("Введите число x");             double x = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());       while (true)          {   Console.WriteLine("Введите число y");             double y = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());             Console.WriteLine("// Выберите операцию //");             Console.WriteLine("+ - сложение");             Console.WriteLine("- - вычитание");             Console.WriteLine("* - умножение");             Console.WriteLine("/ - деление");             string z = Console.ReadLine();                 switch (z)                 {                     case "+":                         Console.WriteLine("// Результат //");                         Console.WriteLine(x + y);                         break;                     case "-":                         Console.WriteLine("// Результат //");                         Console.WriteLine(x - y);                         break;                     case "*":                         Console.WriteLine("// Результат //");                         Console.WriteLine(x * y);                         break;                     case "/":                         if (y == 0)                         {                             Console.WriteLine("Не дели на 0");                         }                         else                         {                             Console.WriteLine("// Результат //");                             Console.WriteLine(x / y);                         }                         break;                 } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>I've successfully added division by zero restriction, but that's about all. I don't know, how to make this "chain of calculations". Of course, I understand that I must use loop, but can't come up with anyting. What I've got not is - two numbers are getting operated and that's all, program stops. I tried adding</p>  <pre><code>do   {     //main program body     Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to continue");     keyInfo = Console.ReadKey(true);   } while (keyInfo.Key == ConsoleKey.Enter); </code></pre>  <p>but that only makes the program start from the beginning. I need the result of the first operation to become the first operand and so on. Then user must type something for this program to end.</p>  <p>Sorry for my English, and sorry for my poor c# knowledge, unfortunately, I'm a beginner. Hope to hear soon, thanks in advance.</p>
