<p>I have very weird problem with own Rails console. I know, it sounds strange, but it (rails console) doesn't define "e" (in lowercase) letter. Even I paste whole word. E.g: if I put something like "Every Exchange and else", it will show me: "Evry Exchang and ls".</p>  <p>I guess I have some problem with by zsh profile file (I use oh my zsh), but can't figure out what exactly is wrong.</p>  <p>If someone had same problem before, please help me.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
