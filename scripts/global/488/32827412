<p>I use a simple jquery command in the Google Chrome console to manage my site. Basically, I have to approve a number of new requests every day, so I use:</p>  <pre><code>$('.approve').click(); </code></pre>  <p>where 'approve' is the class name of the button that needs to get clicked. This saves me hours. However, this crashes my browser every time, and sometimes doesn't work, mainly because of the resource taxing it put on my laptop. I was looking for a way to slow down the actions of the function. I tried... </p>  <pre><code>$('.approve').click().delay(1000); </code></pre>  <p>to try and slow it down by 1 second between button clicks. This didn't seem to work (it ran without errors but I don't think it slowed down the clicking. </p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Edit:</p>  <p>Someone pointed out that this may be a duplicate of another question. The reason it isn't is that the other top answer focuses on using JS to define a function that uses setTimeout(), where I am looking for a native jquery method of doing it. I understand jquery is written in JS, but because I'm using it in a command console, I don't have the luxury of multiple lines of coding space.</p>  <p>Can anyone also tell me why the above function wouldn't work? It seems like it should, based on my research.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
