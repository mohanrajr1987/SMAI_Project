<p>I had two custom domains on my setup. Now one is not there, the domain in question, www.emlakair.com is still working and pointing to the app engine code, but missing from the developers console. The other domain is www.catchamove.com. This is working also and visible under custom domains. </p>  <p>I have not done anything with the custom domains since they have been working so no changes on my part there. However, I have recently setup an account on with Google's search console and both the same domains are listing on there. My domain settings remain unchanged since verification of the domain first time around and everything seems fine that end. </p>  <p>Does anyone have a clue, I could try to re-verify the missing domain but that will mean changing the CNAME record and that will take the domain down for a while. </p>  <p>Here is the CNAME record data: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxudA.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxudA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Can anyone from Google or anyone else for that matter explain this or provide a solution.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
