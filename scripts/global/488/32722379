<p>I have my c# Console application Project MyApp01, wihch uses <code>mydll.dll</code> (used as private assembly in same project folder) for accessing database.</p>  <p>Now I am using same dll for my another project i.e. MyApp02. Additionally, I am keeping my exe and other supporting file in same folder for giving to my end user. So now its conflicts because there are two <code>Introp.mydll.dll</code> which I have used in my two projects i.e. myApp01, MyApp02.</p>  <p>What should I do to avoid this? I want to give only final exe file to end user.</p>
