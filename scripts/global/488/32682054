<p>I am trying to solve this problem <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/simon" rel="nofollow">https://open.kattis.com/problems/simon</a> on open.kattis.com and I have this piece of code and it does exactly what it is supposed to, if the string starts with simon says then it the rest of the string is outputed, and if it doesn't start with simon says then output a blank line.</p>  <pre><code>using System;  namespace Tester {     internal class Program     {         private static void Main(string[] args)         {             int lines = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());             string[] inputs = new string[lines];             for (int i = 0; i &lt; lines; i++)             {                 inputs[i] = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();                 if (inputs[i].StartsWith("simon says"))                     inputs[i] = inputs[i].Substring(10);                 else                     inputs[i] = "";             }              for (int i = 0; i &lt; lines; i++)                 Console.WriteLine(inputs[i]);         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>Input:</p>  <pre><code>4 simon says write a program print some output simon whispers do not stress simon says get balloons </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>write a program   get balloons </code></pre>  <p>The testcase works fine in VS. No exceptions there. But when I submit it for testing, I get Runtime Error. Any ideas what it could be caused by? The platform says that it is an uncaught exception, but does not specify what exception</p>  <p>Edit: So now I have wrong answer although the output is correct when testing in VS.</p>  <p>Edit: Test case works in kattis.com but not their hidden test case</p>
