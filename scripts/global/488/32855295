<p>I have setup a serial port on a linux virtual machine (on VMWare ESXi 5.5) to the following options</p>  <ul> <li>Use Network  <ul> <li>Server(VM listens for connection)</li> <li>Port URI : telnet ://:26000</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>From my MAC client, I am able to telnet to the virtual machine using </p>  <ul> <li>telnet ESXi Server IP Address 26000</li> </ul>  <p>The problem is that I am not able to see console output when the virtual machine is booting up. The Telnet connection from my MAC OSX laptop only starts taking input and displays output after the virtual machine is fully booted.</p>  <p>I wanted to capture output of the boot process and then halfway through the boot process, supply some variables to control the linux virtual machine's install. </p>  <p>Does anyone have any suggestions ?</p>  <p>Regards</p>
