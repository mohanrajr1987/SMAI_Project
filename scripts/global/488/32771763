<p>My question is about Java.</p>  <p>Is there a way to print out a String in the console when using Scanner so the user can edit and/or add more to it?</p>  <p>For example...</p>  <pre><code>String aString = "Hello!" System.out.println("Write some text, please."); aString = scanner.nextLine(); </code></pre>  <p>And now I want some sort of System.out of aString but editable. I want the user to be able to simply edit aString. When user finish editing, Scanner will save everything to aString again.</p>  <p>My solution right now is I let the user input some new text and then just add it to the end of the String using:</p>  <pre><code>    aString += scanner.nextLine(); </code></pre>  <p>Appreciate any help. Thank you.</p>
