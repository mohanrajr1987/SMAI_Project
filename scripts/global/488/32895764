<p>So basically I am experimenting with writing a path finding program that find a path from some point in a 10*10 grid to another, that is fine. </p>  <p>I have a class <code>Path</code> that is an ArrayList of <code>GridSquare</code>s (which are just glorified co-ordinates).</p>  <p>I have written a small method within the <code>Path</code> class to display the path, and this is where the problem, which is so minor but so very infuriating, arises.</p>  <p>When I try to run the code, and call <code>displayPath</code>, <em><b>nothing</b></em> is output to the console and the program terminates with no errors.  </p>  <p>Here is the code for <code>displayPath</code>:</p>  <pre><code>public void displayPath(){     System.out.println("This is displayPrint"); //This line is included to make sure the program calls the method correctly.     for(int i=1; i==10; i++){         for(int j=1; j==10; j++){             if(this.includesSquare(i, j)){                 System.out.print("[x]");             } else {                 System.out.print("[ ]");             }         }         System.out.print("\n");     } } </code></pre>  <p>I included the first line to ensure that the console/System.out.print() was working correctly and this gets displayed every time the method is called.</p>  <p>Here is the code for <code>includesSquare</code>:</p>  <pre><code>public boolean includesSquare(int x, int y){     for(GridSquare square : this.path){         if(square.getX()==x &amp;&amp; square.getY()==y){             return true;         }     }     return false; } </code></pre>  <p>I have uninstalled and re-installed Eclipse, copied the java files into a new project ect and nothing seems to make any difference. I know the console is working fine as it displays the first line of <code>displayPath</code> correctly. </p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
