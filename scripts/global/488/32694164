<p>Hi this is my first post here,</p>  <p>when i am using for example the MYSQL command line tool with a simple query like "select * from table", i obviously get the table content printed to the command line. If i am missspelling the query i obviously get a MYSQL error printed.</p>  <p>Now, i was wondering if there is any way i can get these kind of outputs from the command line, when i am executing a query via JDBC, and put them in string.</p>  <p>My goal is to implement two textfields in a Java GUI, one as input for executing a MYSQL query, one for displaying the output that i would get if i were using the command line tool. It is basically a command line tool implemented in Java.</p>  <p>I looked thoroughly via google but couldnt find anything. (I wasn't too shure what exactly to look for anyway. How do you call the output of the command line tool? I tried trace, stacktrace but i wasn't sure)</p>  <p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
