<p>I am wondering which is the best practice to read a matrix entered directly to the console as string with copy/paste from a text file?</p>  <p>This is an example of the matrix, however as a whole sting with the new lines at the end and without newlines between the rows (I do not know how to represent a matrix here, sorry):</p>  <p><i> 5 6 8 12 34</p>  <p>13 4 9 20 3</p>  <p>8 17 2 2 5 </i></p>  <p>It would be great to have a int[,] as a result which would be able to be written on the console with something like nested loops.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, and sorry for the novice question (may be)!</p>
