<p>I am new to visual basic at college and I am using the purely console-based version of the software. I have been set a task to, without using an array, allow the user to input 5 student names and their respective test scores and store them in 10 separate variables, using a loop. The program must then output the highest test score and the student it is assigned to. </p>  <p>I know that I have to use a for loop for this and have been trying to concatenate the i (assuming for i = 1 to 5) with variable names and then using console.readline to assign the variables to a value. This has been to no avail so far and I don't know what to do. Any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>George </p>
