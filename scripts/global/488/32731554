<p>I'm attempting to create an arena style game in the console but I need a little help. I've got the grid and I'm now able to move the player around but I don't think I'm doing it the best way that I could be. What would be a better way?</p>  <pre><code>import subprocess as sp plyr_x, plyr_y = (9,5)  def create_board():     board = []     for _ in range(10):         board.append(['-']*10)     board[plyr_x][plyr_y] ='o'     return board  def print_board(board):     tmp = sp.call('clear')     for row in board:         print ' '.join(row)  board = create_board() print_board(board) while True:     direction = raw_input('Which way do you want to move? ')     if direction == 'up':         plyr_x += -1         print_board(create_board())     elif direction == 'down':         plyr_x += 1         print_board(create_board())     elif direction == 'right':         plyr_y += 1         print_board(create_board())     elif direction == 'left':         plyr_y += -1         print_board(create_board()) </code></pre>
