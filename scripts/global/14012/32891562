<p>My datagrid has a depth-dimensions column that shows fractions (one dimension used for example is 24 3/8). I have the ability to choose the text (fraction or decimal), but essentially I would need to be able to convert back and forth from <strong>24 3/8</strong> to <strong>24.375</strong>.</p>  <p><strong>Why the Decimal format is needed</strong>: I have checkboxes to filter the depth-dimensions column, so I'll need decimal form for that logic (e.g. checkbox to see filter depth-dimensions between 20 and 26). </p>  <p><strong>Why the fraction format is needed:</strong> I'll need the fraction format because that depth-dimension data will be referenced as a string in another part of the application. The filter doesn't work when in this format is used in the dataGrid, because it won't recognize 24 3/8 as a number/int.</p>  <p>So basically I'm looking for a way to convert between the two formats, <strong>24 3/8 to 24.375</strong> and <strong>24.375 to 24 3/8</strong>.  </p>  <p>Again, my apologies for the confusion - I'm able to re-edit and/or add more details if needed.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>--moe  </p>
