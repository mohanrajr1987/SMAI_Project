<p>I am needing to create a typing test that I can integrate in with an Abode Captivate training simulation I have created. I am having to create a widget in flash professional. I have been able to create one in HTML and was just going to try and replicate it in Flash Professional. Is that even possible or would I have to completely re-write my code in flash professional?</p>  <p>Here is my HTML code and I am wanting it in Flash Professional using ActionScript 3.0.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt;  &lt;HEAD&gt;    &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;     msg = new Array("After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!
