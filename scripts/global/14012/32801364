<p>I'm redesigning a user registration form to decouple my UI from my SQL back-end by using value objects(VO). I know how to pass form fields into a CFC through use of a remote object using <code>&lt;mx:RemoteObject&gt; &lt;mx:Method&gt;&lt;/mx:RemoteObject&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;mx:Method&gt;</code> references the function in the CFC that flex form elements are being passed to. </p>  <p>What I want to do is pass my entire VO into my CFC service to be inserted in the DB table. Most of the code I've seen attempting to do that doesn't seem to work. Can someone recommend how to best pass a VO from flex to Coldfusion?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
