<p>My problem after building the project in flash builder 4.7 with sdk version 4.0A is as follows:-  </p>  <p>1) when i run build-release folder from within flash builder the request from app to server works (the request is initiated in click event).  </p>  <p>2) when i run the .html file from projects build-release folder the request is not even initiated in browser network log.  </p>  <p>I'm using flash builder 4.7 with sdk 4.0A installed and selected. Since I'm new to actionscript and flash builder sdk, please a detailed answer will be heartly appreciated.   </p>  <p>delete request not being sent from browser the code is like:-  </p>  <pre><code>public function sendDelete(params:Object):void{         var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(url);         request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;         request.contentType = "application/json";         request.requestHeaders = [new URLRequestHeader('X-HTTP-Method-Override', 'DELETE')];         request.data = JSON.stringify(params);         loader.load(request);     }   </code></pre>  <p>app when run/debug from flash builder the request get issued (seen in browsers network log), but when the app is build and run from build-release folder (i.e. running .html file) the request does not get issued (not seen in browsers network log). But if I remove the line "        request.requestHeaders = [new URLRequestHeader('X-HTTP-Method-Override', 'DELETE')];" the request works even from build-release folder.</p>
