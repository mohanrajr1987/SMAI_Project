<p>Similar to how you can launch the iOS simulator from Flash Builder 4.7 and get debug (console) output, is there a way to do the same thing with the Android Emulator?</p>  <p>Specifically, I'd like to be able to launch my AIR app from Flash Builder in the Android Emulator and have the console output show up in Flash Builder.</p>  <p>Failing that, I'll research how to launch the emulator from the commandline and do it that way.</p>
