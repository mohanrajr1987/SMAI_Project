<p>Hey im looking for a date-field component since 2 days now </p>  <p>and i finally find a library able to give me one : </p>  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/as3-date-picker/source/browse/trunk/v4/src/nid/ui/controls/DatePicker.as?r=51" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/as3-date-picker/source/browse/trunk/v4/src/nid/ui/controls/DatePicker.as?r=51</a></p>  <p>I put in my AS3 :</p>  <pre><code>import flash.events.MouseEvent; import flash.net.navigateToURL; import nid.ui.controls.DatePicker; var mainInstance;     var date:DatePicker = new DatePicker();     date.months =   ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"];     addChild(date);     date.font = "Helvetica Neue";     date.iconPlacement = "right";     date.dateFormat = "D/M/Y";     date.selectedDate = new Date(); </code></pre>  <p>But in the library u can see at line 172-179 a setter to change the Calendar Placement in this [Inspectable] function that i don't understand.</p>  <p>I just want to change this field by "top" like this when i'll click on my Datefield the Calendar will pop on the top of the component and not on the right like as default..</p>  <p>(I've never worked with Inspectable before be gentle o/ Thx :)</p>
