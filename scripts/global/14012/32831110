<p>I have two sets of ranges that I need to be translated from one to the other.</p>  <p>The first range is <code>-100 ↔ 100</code> with <code>0</code> being default.</p>  <p>The second range is <code>0.0 ↔ 10.0</code> with <code>1</code> being default.</p>  <p>I am working in AS3 with the first range and the second range is a python class and I need these numbers to line up.</p>  <p>I am adjusting brightness of a video in realtime with a slider. The video filter accepts values between <code>-100 ↔ 100</code>. I need to then take that value and pass it to a python script but it only accepts values from <code>0.0 ↔ 10.0</code> </p>  <p>I tried this function I found on the net, but it doesn't translate the values correctly in this particular case.</p>  <pre><code>private function convertRange(originalStart:Number,originalEnd:Number,newStart:Number,newEnd:Number,value:Number):Number {     var originalRange:Number = originalEnd - originalStart;     var newRange:Number = newEnd - newStart;     var ratio:Number = newRange / originalRange;     var newValue:Number = value * ratio;     var finalValue:Number = newValue + newStart;     return finalValue; }        </code></pre>  <p>Is this even possible? Hopefully my question is clear, please let me know if it needs clarification.</p>  <p>This is the python class I am referring to: <a href="https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-adjust" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-adjust</a> It uses the second range whereas AS3 uses the first range.</p>
