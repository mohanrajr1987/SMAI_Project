<p>Library: host - Host fileicon - file</p>  <p>Information: Host is a container, it has a mask and I will use this to have lot's of child objects called files. Later in the code I wish to have a removeChild(Host) so when I activate this, it will remove the Host thus removing all the files too. Clean slate. </p>  <p>The file itself is just an object, i have the rest of the code working fine but whenever it comes to adding these to the host, it just wont work...  Obviously here you see the Host is actually created in a hostSetup function and the files will be created in the addfiles function but i need to communicate between the two to add the file into the host.  -Re wrote this to hopefully make it a little more understandable.</p>  <p>(sorry its it confuses you)</p>  <pre><code>function hostSetup() {     addChild(Host);     addChild(HostMask); } function addFiles() {     Host.addChild(file); } </code></pre>
