<p>I have an object on my stage that can be dragged. On release, it snaps back into its orginal position. I want to be able to tween it back into its original position so that it will look smooth and not choppy.  Here is the code that I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>var startPosition:Point;  blockSmallz.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, dragz); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dragStopz);  function dragz(e:Event):void { blockSmallz.startDrag(); startPosition = new Point( blockSmallz.x, blockSmallz.y); }  function dragStopz(e:Event):void { blockSmallz.stopDrag(); //set back or tween position  blockSmallz.x = startPosition.x; blockSmallz.y = startPosition.y; startPosition = null;  } </code></pre>
