<p>I'm developing a game where I have lots of collisions, and it rapidly came to notice that my bottleneck is this line:</p>  <pre><code>if(Point.distance(_point1, _point2) &lt; collisionDistance){   //do stuff } </code></pre>  <p>where _point1 and _point2 are static variables that store the positions of objects that could collide if the collisionDistance is low enough. </p>  <p>Do you know of any more performant method to check a simple collision between two circles?.</p>
