<p>Making a game. My folder tree looks like this: ClassHole\ContentDB, Screens, Utilities. and ClassHole\Graphics\Characers, Items, Effects, etc. HeroSelect_scn is in the Screens folder. I want to make a character select screen with a TileList. My character MovieClips are in ClassHole\ContentDB\Characters. They are made with the graphics from Graphics\Characters. I'd like to use the single image from ClassHole\Graphics\Characters\Playable\Pokemon\RbySphHeros and they images are 0.png, 1.png, etc. At first I thought that I could just reference the character MovieClip but that didn't work. I think that you have to rip the first frame in a bitmap and all that. I'd rather not if I can just use the original image. </p>  <pre><code>package  ClassHole.Screens{  import flash.display.MovieClip; import fl.controls.TileList; import fl.controls.ScrollBarDirection; import fl.data.DataProvider;  public class HeroSelect_scn extends MovieClip  {     private var HeroList:Array = [RbySphHero, RedMage];     public var dp:DataProvider = new DataProvider();      public function HeroSelect_scn()      {         dp.addItem({label:"RbySphHero", source:"Graphics/Characters/Playable/Pokemon/RbySphHeroes/0.png"});         dp.addItem({label:"RedMage", source:""});          Heros_tilelist.dataProvider = dp;         Heros_tilelist.columnWidth = 125;         Heros_tilelist.rowHeight = 85;         Heros_tilelist.columnCount = 4;         Heros_tilelist.rowCount = 1;     } }} </code></pre>  <p>I figure it's a problem with how I'm trying to reference the image file. Is it because the Graphics folder isn't within the scope of HeroSelect_scn? It won't let me import ClassHole.Graphics... What am I doing wrong?</p>
