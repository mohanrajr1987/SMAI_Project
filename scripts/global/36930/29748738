<p><br /> I'm using Java to create dinamically images and put them into a jsp page. This works fine in all browsers, except for IE 7. <br /> I'm using Data URIs in my jsp to populate  tags (I'm using a base64 string). I've found many solutions for IE, but no one refers to images dinamically created in Java. <br /> This is one of the solutions found with css:</p>  <pre><code>/* Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="MYSEPARATOR"  --MYSEPARATOR Content-Location: myimage Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64  iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAIAAAA7ljmRAAAAGElEQVQIW2P4DwcMDAxAfBvMAhEQMYgcACEHG8ELxtbPAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC  --MYSEPARATOR-- */  #test1 {     width: 100px;     height: 100px;     background-image:url(mhtml:http://......./test.css!myimage); } </code></pre>  <p>It works but I can't change in css the base64 string dinamically. <br /> How can I solve this problem for explorer 7?<br /> Thanks in advice.</p>
