<p>I need to pass a message from an iframe to the parent window. The parent window and iframe window are from different domains so I am running into difficulty with same origin restrictions (i.e., my attempts to access <code>window.parent</code> from the iframe are blocked).</p>  <p>I have been able to pass messages from the parent window to the iframe using the <code>window.location.hash</code> method as described in <a href="http://mattsnider.com/hash-hack-for-cross-domain-iframe-communication/" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. However, the method does not appear to work for sending messages from the iframe to the parent window.</p>  <p>I must also find a solution that works in IE7 and IE8.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to do this?</p>  <p>I'm about to give up and build a web API to facilitate messages from the iframe to the parent window.</p>
