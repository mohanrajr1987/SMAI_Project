<p>I have an unordered list. The list items are <code>inline-block</code>. I can't and won't use <code>float:left</code> because I need to align them to the bottom vertically. Everything's fine. The whole layout works across every browser except IE7 which seems to apply the <code>whitespace:nowrap;</code> property on the <code>ul</code> in <strong>IE Inspector</strong> but doesn't really apply it. The list items still get stacked when browser's width is small.</p>  <pre><code>div#container {     display: inline-block;     *display: inline;     zoom: 1; } div#container &gt; ul {     white-space:nowrap; } div#container &gt; ul &gt; li {     display: inline-block;     *display: inline;     zoom: 1;     vertical-align: bottom; } </code></pre>  <p>Can't post a fiddle. Because jsFiddle itself doesn't work on IE7.</p>
