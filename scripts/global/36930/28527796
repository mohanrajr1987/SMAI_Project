<p>I need to install IE 9 on a Windows 7 VM for testing but I can't find Internet Explorer 9 download. The links to Microsoft to download IE 9 are pointing to IE 11. I saw some other links in Microsoft social and those are gone too. I even tried installed IE 7 and then patch it up and remove IE 11 from Programs and Features like some suggested and it reverted to IE 8. Help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
