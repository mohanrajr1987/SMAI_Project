<p>Is there a way how to correctly upload a file to Asp Net Mvc application in Internet Explorer 7?</p>  <ol> <li>I would like to customize button text, so a pure input type="file" isn't applicable</li> <li>I would like my browse button to have the same style as other buttons, that is be a button, not div, so e.g. valums fileuploader isn't applicable</li> <li>I don't want to get "Access denied" exception (ie7) when submittig a file, so input type="file" somehow should be accessible</li> <li>When uploading a file I don't want the form to be submitted, because other inputs may not be filled by user yet.</li> </ol>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. Examples would be awesome!</p>
