<p>Normally in an HTML file you can use the mouse to select and copy text or by pressing CTRL+A and CTRL+C. This even works in HTA programs on Windows systems.</p>  <p>However, I am unable to do this when I create a modeless dialog window using <code>window.showModelessDialog()</code> in the HTA file. The HTML document is loaded and displayed properly, but I am unable to select/highlight any text in the child window using the mouse or CTRL+A and CTRL+C.</p>  <p>Is there a workaround? If I try to use <code>window.open()</code> instead, then it opens a full-blown browser window including address bar, tabs, menu bar, etc. Also, the child window uses IE version 11 instead of version 7 used for the HTA program. I want to avoid doing this.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>  <p>[edit]</p>  <p>Here are the top few lines of the child HTA file.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt; &lt;HTML&gt;     &lt;HEAD&gt;         &lt;meta http-equiv="MSThemeCompatible" content="Yes" /&gt;         &lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;         &lt;link rel="icon" href="../toee_raw_checker.ico" type="image/x-icon" /&gt;         &lt;TITLE&gt;Calculations&lt;/TITLE&gt;         &lt;HTA:APPLICATION             ID = "oApp"             APPLICATIONNAME = "ToEE RAW Checker Calculations"             BORDER = "thick"             CAPTION = "yes"             ICON = "toee_raw_checker.ico"             SHOWINTASKBAR = "yes"             SINGLEINSTANCE = "no"             WINDOWSTATE = "normal"             SCROLL = "no"             SCROLLFLAT = "yes"             VERSION = "0.6.1"             INNERBORDER = "no"             SELECTION = "yes"             SYSMENU = "yes"             MAXIMIZEBUTTON = "yes"             MINIMIZEBUTTON = "yes"             NAVIGABLE = "yes"             CONTEXTMENU = "yes"             BORDERSTYLE = "thin"         /&gt; </code></pre>
