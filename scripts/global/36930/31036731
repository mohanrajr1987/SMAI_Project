<p>We use Telerik RadMenu in our ASP.net application.  When I use IE7 compatibility mode, RadMenu displays fine in Chrome and IE browsers. But when I remove IE7 compatibility mode, RadMenu display in IE is changed to have a unpleasing height. But it still works fine in chrome. See the image below.</p>  <p>RadMenu is using the Default skin.  Any ideas in making it work when IE7 mode is removed?.  </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lJcdH.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
