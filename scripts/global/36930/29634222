<p>We are using <code>ASP.NET MVC 3.0.0.1</code>. The server was having <code>3.0.0.0</code>. So, during the recent Production release, we applied updates to the server and restarted it (to have <code>MVC</code> version <code>3.0.0.1</code> on the server). </p>  <p>After that, everything is running properly on <code>IE9</code> (<code>Internet Explorer 9</code>). But, for the users using <code>IE8</code> and <code>IE7</code>, there are issues like not able to enter text in one of the <code>textbox</code>es on pop up and some other display issues, like alignment issues.</p>  <p>How can this be fixed for <code>IE7</code> and <code>IE8</code>?</p>
