<p>We are developing a website on ASP.net 2.0, everything seem fine until we have to develop a project which uses the existing project but runs on IE7 and problems showed up in no time. </p>  <p>Now in IE7, I can't login into the website by clicking the button : </p>  <pre><code>&lt;p class="logout"&gt;     &lt;asp:Button ID="btnLogin" runat="server" Text="ログイン" Height="36px" TabIndex="40" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It gives me this error : </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Object doesn't support property or method 'attachEvent'</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have added this line in the <code>head</code> tag : </p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there anyway to solve this? </p>
