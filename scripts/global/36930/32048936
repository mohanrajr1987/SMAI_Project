<p>What I have is a page with tables and data in those grids. In the webpage I am need to show in a single page and when printing each tables needs to be in different pages.</p>  <p>I am using </p>  <pre><code> &lt;style type="text/css" media="print"&gt;      table.page     {        page-break-before: always;         /*page-break-after: always;*/      } &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;table class="page" border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have made it work till IE8. But there is need for it to work with IE7 too. There are some post regarding the same. But I didn't get a working answer for the issue. <strong>Does anyone have a solution for this? Does IE7 support page-break-after and page-break-before?</strong></p>
