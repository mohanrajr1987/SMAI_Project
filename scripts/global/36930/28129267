<p>I've been searching for permanent solution to make the existing pages(ASP.Net) which are working perfect in IE7 to work in IE11 as well. I've seen some solutions to manipulate meta tag.</p>  <p><b> meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" </b></p>  <p>could someone please provide some real solutions to fix these problems?</p>  <p>Right now i see too many CSS Issues &amp; Javascript errors in IE11 which worked good in IE7.</p>  <p>It would be really helpful it someone provides a solution without CSS Hacks or manipulating content of meta tag. I'm not targeting my website to be cross browser but it atleast should work in Internet explorer irrespective of its version.</p>  <p>I saw below references from MSDN: but it didn't give any solution to make websites render in all versions of IE, it was addressing issues about legacy browser.</p>  <p><b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee318404.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee318404.aspx</a> </b></p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.</p>
