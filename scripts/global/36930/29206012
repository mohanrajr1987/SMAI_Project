<p>Because of client requirement, I need my website to be able to work with IE 7. Actually, to be able to work with <em>IE 11 in compatibility mode set to IE 7</em>. <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;</code> is not enough for the client because they want to be able to switch to whichever IE they want in the compatibility mode.</p>  <p>The problem is, after I add the site's address, which I uses external IP address, to the compatibility view:</p>  <ul> <li>If I set the compatibility mode to <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=7"&gt;</code> directly at the HTML header code, the page result just fine. (I open the developer tools and check on the document mode, the "7 (default)" is selected automatically).</li> <li>But if I start with <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;</code>, and then I open developer mode and change the document mode from EDGE to IE 7 manually, the site is reloading, but then the site's layout will be messed up.</li> </ul>  <p>Can I ask why this can happen? Why it's different? Where the difference is? How can I eliminate these differences? Thanks.</p>
