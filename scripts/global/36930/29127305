<p>I'm trying to demonstrate to some folks in a seminar how particular elements (be they html tags, css defined styles or JavaScript behaviors) that were coded to work properly in IE7, also works in IE8, but fails in IE11.</p>  <p>Currently the intranet I'm showing works properly in IE11, but I want to change the code so that it doesn't. In other words, what can I add/change to my code that will allow it to continue rendering correctly in IE8 but breaks in IE11?</p>
