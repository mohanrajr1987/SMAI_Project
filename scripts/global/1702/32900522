<p>The <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/libs/graph/doc/compressed_sparse_row.html" rel="nofollow">Boost docs for compressed sparse row graph</a> mention:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>...CSR graphs have much less overhead than many other graph formats (e.g., adjacency_list)...</p> </blockquote>  <p>What exactly is the improvement on overhead with CSR compared to an adjacency list? Both require O(|V| + |E|) memory to store the graph. I think time complexity for edge existence operations is the same as well.</p>  <p>What is this overhead referring to?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> after some thought, I have a feeling that it could be because each element in each row of the matrix are stored in contiguous memory locations?</p>
