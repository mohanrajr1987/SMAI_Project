<p>I am attempting to include specific header files in a yocto build that are found in dev packages. The packages are boost and alsa.</p>  <p>I have included the bitbake recipe files into my image recipe which is a bbappend of a core recipe (console-trdx-image.bb) as an IMAGE_INSTALL += and bitbaked the image.</p>  <p>When I look in my build work directory, in the packages for alsa and boost all the files are resident where I want them to be - usr/include/alsa as an example.</p>  <p>I am having difficulty getting the built/installed package material into the rootfs of the image itself.</p>  <p>My .bbappend for alsa is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>    do_install_append() {      # Create alsa dirs     install -d ${D}/${includedir}/alsa     install -d ${D}/${includedir}/alsa/sound     # Install headers     install -m 0755 ${S}/include/*.h ${D}/${includedir}/alsa     install -m 0755 ${S}/include/sound/*.h ${D}/${includedir}/alsa/sound  }  # Include these files in the install on the target FILES_${PN} += "${includedir}/alsa/*.h" </code></pre>  <p>When I look in /usr/include in the rootfs of the created image there isn't anything there. Not a sausage.</p>  <p>Anyone any ideas why?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
