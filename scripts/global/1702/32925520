<p>I cannot see the reason for using strand for synchronization in Boost.asio HTTP Server3 example. As far as I can see in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/cpp03/http/server3/connection.cpp" rel="nofollow">connection.cpp</a> there is always just one IO operation pending, consequently no simultaneous read/write access to the buffrer. So it seems that any synchronization attempt is unnecessary here. What am I missing here?</p>
