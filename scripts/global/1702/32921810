<p>My demo c++ app is using boost log library, it works fine before. Recently, I upgrade my Ubuntu to 15.04 and install gcc 4.9.2 and clang++ 3.6. I compile boost 1.59 using clang tool first. Then recompile my demo c++ app, it reports compilation errors as following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>clang++ -g -std=c++11 -I../include  -Wall -DBOOST_LOG_DYN_LINK -o</p>      <p>./object/main.cc.o -c ../src/main.cc In file included from</p>      <p>../src/main.cc:8: In file included from ../include/helper/logger.h:16:</p>      <p>In file included from /usr/include/boost/log/sinks.hpp:25: In file</p>      <p>included from /usr/include/boost/log/sinks/async_frontend.hpp:42: In</p>      <p>file included from</p>      <p>/usr/include/boost/log/sinks/unbounded_fifo_queue.hpp:29: In file</p>      <p>included from /usr/include/boost/log/detail/event.hpp:25: In file</p>      <p>included from /usr/include/boost/atomic/capabilities.hpp:18: In file</p>      <p>included from /usr/include/boost/atomic/detail/platform.hpp:22:</p>      <p>/usr/include/boost/atomic/detail/gcc-atomic.hpp:35:67: error: unknown</p>      <p>type name 'memory_order' BOOST_FORCEINLINE BOOST_CONSTEXPR int</p>      <p>convert_memory_order_to_gcc(memory_order order) BOOST_NOEXCEPT</p>      <p>/usr/include/boost/atomic/detail/gcc-atomic.hpp:37:22: error: use of</p>      <p>undeclared identifier 'memory_order_relaxed'</p>      <p>return (order == memory_order_relaxed ? __ATOMIC_RELAXED : (order == </p>      <p>memory_order_consume ? __ATOMIC_CONSUME</p> </blockquote>
