<p>I'm compiling the <strong>iostreams</strong> library in Boost in Windows. It appears that it creates a <strong>boost_zlib*.dll</strong> file automatically. I want to create two versions of the iostreams <strong>.lib</strong> and <strong>.dll</strong> files with separate names for both 32 and 64 bits to put into the same folder. I can easily rename the "iostreams" files. I also need to place the "boost_zlib" files in the same folder. However, since "boost_zlib" file are created automatically, I can't just rename them. </p>  <p>Is there a way to specify the "boost_zlib" output file name so that I can append a "32" or "64" to the file name in order for me to place both files in the same folder?</p>
