<p>I get this error when using gcc to compile a file called <code>evr.cpp</code>. </p>  <pre><code>evr.cpp:4:10: fatal error: 'boost/interprocess/ipc/message_queue.hpp' file not found #include &lt;boost/interprocess/ipc/message_queue.hpp&gt;          ^ 1 error generated. </code></pre>  <p>I placed the boost library in the <code>/usr/local/include</code> folder. I did in fact check that the that file does exist. Is gcc looking in the wrong place. Did I place the library in the wrong place?</p>  <p>I'm running OSX Yosemite 10.10.5.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
