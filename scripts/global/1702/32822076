<p>I'm writing a C++ application <em>A</em> that calls another application <em>B</em> in the background. Some command line options are for application <em>A</em>, but some should be forwarded to <em>B</em>. Separation should work with a double dash <code>--</code>.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>./my_executable_A -a --long_b some_file -- -c --long_d </code></pre>  <p>should parse <code>{"-a", "--long_b", "some_file"}</code> in application <em>A</em> and forward <code>{"-c", "--long_d"}</code> to application <em>B</em> when it is called by <em>A</em>.</p>  <p>I thought it might make sense to use <code>boost::program_options</code> for the task, but I didn't find this functionality. Is this possible?</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The use case is a <code>libfuse</code> file system where some of the options are to be forwarded to the <code>fuse_main()</code> function.</p>
