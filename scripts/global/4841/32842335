<p>I have recently upgraded a framework I am developing with and one of the jars from the old install has been upgraded to a newer version (i.e. the name of the jar is different).</p>  <p>All of the (200+) projects in my workspace depend on this jar and so now are displaying the following two errors:</p>  <ol> <li>"Project 'Blah' is missing required library"</li> <li>"The project cannot be build until build path errors are resolved"</li> </ol>  <p>It will take me a substantial amount of time to modify the build path of every project in my workspace, firstly removing the incorrect jar and then adding the new one.</p>  <p><strong>Is there a way to add/remove a jar to all (or a group of) projects in one go?</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911554/how-to-tell-eclipse-to-include-standard-jar-library-for-all-projects">This question</a> illustrates adding jars using libraries - something I could use going forward but doesn't fix my current problem.</p>  <p>I am running Eclipse Mars 4.5.0</p>
