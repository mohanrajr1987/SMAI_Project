<p>I am editing a report in iReport that someone else has previously made and I am wondering as to how i could figure out which .jar files they were referencing to compile the report. Is there a way to do this in iReport or am I just going to have to ask? Also- if I can figure it out where do I find a collection of .jar files to download and use?</p>  <p>There is no code with this, I'm simply trying to learn my way around iReport.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>  <p>-Colt</p>
