<p>I have created for a first time a programm in Java SWING including RMI Connection with PORT (Server - Client) in Eclipse.</p>  <p>Now I want to export only the Client (to a jar File if its possible ) and test it (via install it) to another computer so I could see if it works and how it works. </p>  <p>The Structure of my project in Eclipse is like :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dspST.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dspST.png" alt="Client"></a></p>  <p>From there I want only the Client to export and install it to another PC and start the Programm with the LoginForm.java. The .jar export files that have tryed and created they dont do nothing at all. Also dont know if I have to do something specific with the Build Path or the folders (like Image folder) that I have extra create.</p>
