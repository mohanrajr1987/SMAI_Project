<p>Should you use .class files or .java files in a .jar library?</p>  <p>I want to take a class that I've written in a .java file and add it to a jar so I can use it as a library in my tomcat's WEB-INF/lib directory.</p>  <p>I understand that jars can contain .class files, .java files, or both (or just about anything else). I'm wondering what is specifically needed at runtime for my jar to be readable by the JVM. The answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7232448/new-to-java-libraries-what-to-include-in-a-jar-file">this question</a> told me that .class files will work, but will .java files work as well? </p>  <p>I've found many descriptions of how to create a jar, and lots of information on the differences between .java files and .class files. What I'm lacking, I guess, is an understanding of how the jar libraries are interpreted by the JVM. Are they compiled at runtime?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
