<p>I have a .jar file that I've compiled and the class is inside many folders levels. </p>  <p>For instance, my class is on: mainFolder/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/MyClass.class  while my Manifest.mf file contains the "Class-Path: ." .</p>  <p>In my understanding the "." means that my class-path is in the source. </p>  <p>Do we need to specify in class-path that the class is actually on mainFolder/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/MyClass.class instead of only using the "." ? </p>
