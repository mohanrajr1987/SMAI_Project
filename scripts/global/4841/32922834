<p>In order to run this github project <a href="https://github.com/HIIT/maui-2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/HIIT/maui-2</a>, I need to build its jar. I see that Apache Ant is being used.</p>  <p>So I go to <code>/ant</code> directory and by command line I run:</p>  <p><code>ant package</code></p>  <p>but the build fails, as the following output reports:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R2AXm.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R2AXm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>any idea on how to fix this issue? Might it be related to the Java version being used?</p>
