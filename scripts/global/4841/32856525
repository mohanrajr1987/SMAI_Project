<p>i have created an IntelliJ Idea (Community Edition) java project. the project is quite simple. it only contains a main() method, but uses another 2 jars as dependencies. I also created an artifact to the project to build it to a jar.</p>  <p>My question is there any way to build the jar using script? because I want to add the build process to an existing build script.</p>  <p>thanks</p>
