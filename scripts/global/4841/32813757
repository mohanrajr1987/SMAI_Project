<p>I want to be able to use Ant to build a jar file based on a single class within a larger Java project and have it automatically determine dependencies.</p>  <p>I can happily create an Ant build.xml file to create a jar for the project which contains all classes, though this contains many things not required in the jar.</p>  <p>When I include just a single source file, i.e.:</p>  <p><code>&lt;patternset id="source.pattern"&gt;         &lt;include name="MyProject/src/java/com/myproject/cow.java" /&gt; &lt;/patternset&gt;</code></p>  <p>then build the jar I get the obvious complaints about <code>cannot find symbol</code> (regarding objects within the project that are used in <code>cow.java</code>), which indicates it is ONLY including the file I specified.</p>  <p><s>The fact that it can detect the missing symbols / classes / objects suggests it is capable of doing what I require.</s></p>  <p>I don't want it to build from Eclipse. I just want to create a <code>build.xml</code> to run from the command line.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
