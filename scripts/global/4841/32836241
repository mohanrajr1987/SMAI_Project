<p>Its tricky to explain. I have a JAR file framework.jar which loads a class <code>sikuli.class</code> from a folder Libraries and executes a function <code>xyz()</code>  Now this <code>sikuli.class</code> file uses some other JAR files which are API</p>  <p>I have added these APIs while creating the framework.jar and bundled them inside it.</p>  <p>but when I am executing the JAR file it says <code>ClassNotFound</code> for all the import statements inside the <code>sikuli.class</code> file</p>  <p>I tried adding the API JAR files to CLASSPATH also, even that didn't work.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Edit</p> </blockquote>  <p>it is the <code>Class cls= Class.forName(sClassName,true,classes);</code></p>  <p>which is failing to load classes after creating a JAR file  the same code works when I run it through eclipse</p>
