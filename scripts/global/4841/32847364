<p>I am trying to build an installer for a Java application and would like to build a JAR which extracts itself.  The JAR will be built using Maven assembly and will have a main class specified in the manifest.  I want the main class to extract the rest of the JAR into a specified directory.  The JAR will contain other JARs and some docs.  I have found other questions, for example, (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10308221/how-to-copy-file-inside-jar-to-outside-the-jar">How to copy file inside jar to outside the jar?</a>) but they don't address a self extracting JAR.  I would like to know how to 1) obtain the location and name of the JAR from which the main is being executed, 2) copy the contents of the JAR into a specified directory.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I would also appreciate answers which address how to build an installer for a Maven Java application (using Eclipse) in general. </p>
