<p>I am reading XML files that are validated via XSD files into XJC generated classes. That all works fine when I reference the XSD in the normal file system. Now I want to bundle the XSD into my JAR. That also works fine as long the XSD is standalone with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>//Use the schema factory to get the schema SchemaFactory sf = SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI);  //Get XSD from JAR InputStream schemaStream = getClass().getResourceAsStream("/schema/myschema.xsd"); Schema schema = sf.newSchema(new StreamSource(schemaStream));  //parse the XML file and fill the data model Class&lt;T&gt; c = getXmlDataModelClass(); JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(c);  m_JaxbUnmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();  //set the schema to be considered m_JaxbUnmarshaller.setSchema(schema);  return (T)m_JaxbUnmarshaller.unmarshal(file); </code></pre>  <p>Now the problem: if myschema.xsd includes another XSD:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;xs:include schemaLocation="BaseTypes.xsd"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The types in the included XSD are not found.</p>  <p>I also tried to pass an array of two <code>StreamSource</code> with both XSDs into <code>sf.newSchema()</code>, but that did not help.</p>
