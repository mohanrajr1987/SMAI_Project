<p>There is a specific class in a spring jar that I wanted to edit. I created a jar file of my with only this class in it. I have to add my jar file to the classpath in such a way that my jar file is used instead of the original spring jar file. I am working on ubuntu.</p>  <p>What I tried to sort the issue:</p>  <ol> <li>mention the classpath in setenv.sh in /bin of tomcat folder as  setenv CLASSPATH /home/c/C/OwnJars/MyJar.jar</li> </ol>  <p>When I try to debug the code in eclipse, the debugger uses the original spring jar and not the jar that i have set in CLASSPATH.</p>  <p>My question is, how can I make my Jar file to be used instead of the original spring jar?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
