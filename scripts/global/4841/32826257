<p>I am designing a system using Spring where some users should able to implement some classes, submit a JAR and be able to execute their submission provided that the classes inside the Jar comply with the interfaces that are supposed to be implemented. The idea is to have a framework for extensiblility using jars (and some xml configuration files).</p>  <p>My questions is, is this possible? How should I approach the execution of the mentioned Jars and can I validate that the content of the jars complies with the API during submission?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
