<p>I am using Android Studio to create a non-android Java application which is also a module of an android application at the same time.</p>  <p>I need to make a portable package including the dependencies for my application. In this case, I aim for creating a JAR file, however, i couldn't find a proper way to achieve this.</p>  <p>Although creating a Jar from IntelliJ IDEA (which Android Studio is based on) is described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1082580/how-to-build-jars-from-intellij-properly">here</a> , the necessary options appears to be removed from Android Studio.</p>  <p>Does anyone know a way of doing this?</p>  <p>I would really appreciate your guidance.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Note that "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16763090/how-to-export-library-to-jar-in-android-studio">How to export library to Jar in Android Studio?</a>" aims for exporting an android library, on the other hand, my application doesn't have android dependence. None of the solutions there work for directly running a java application.</p>
