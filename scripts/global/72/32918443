<p>I'm working on a website with about 500,000 users, the issue im having is that when a user goes to create a new account the wait time is extremely long because i check if a user exists using this query.</p>  <pre><code>select count(userName) as userNameTotal from user_table where userName = 'hellokitty' </code></pre>  <p>I then decide if they can create account based on if the userNameTotal is greater then 0.</p>  <p>I was going to index the column but i think this would also be slow when it i try to add a user to the table, as the indexed column table will need to be recreated every time a user is added.</p>  <p>Is there a faster way to do this and should this column be indexed?</p>
