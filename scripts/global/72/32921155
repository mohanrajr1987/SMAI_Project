<p>I am utilizing the FocusJoinsAndLeaves/McuJoinsAndLeacves Tables in the Lync database to create a report that is supposed to contain all users that attended at any conference including the (as far as possible) exact join/leave times. Unfortunatly the Join-/Leavetime columns in both tables contain a huge amount (around 20%) of null values. Is this normal Lync-Server behaviour or is there some misconfiguration? Would there by any possibility to get the data from another table?</p>
