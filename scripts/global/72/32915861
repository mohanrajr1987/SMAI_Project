<p>Does anyone know of a good way, programmatically, to determine if a sql server is a mysql or mssql installation?</p>  <p>I've got an app in c# that has to be able to connect to either mysql or mssql. I can connect to either if I know which it is, but I can't tell from the connection settings because all I get are the server name, userid, password, and database name.</p>  <p>I can have the settings file store the type of server, but this opens up an avenue for user error that I'd like to avoid.</p>
