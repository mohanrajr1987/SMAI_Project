<p>Are there any rules/preferences that SQL Server (or perhaps other database server) would choose some index over others when querying ? For example index on <code>JOIN/WHERE/ORDER BY/GROUP BY</code>, etc. columns versus index on <code>SELECT</code> columns; <code>clustered</code> over <code>nonclustered indexes</code>; single-column index versus composite ones; etc.</p>  <p>Taking for example</p>  <pre><code>SELECT col1, col2 FROM myTable WHERE col3 = 'val3' AND col4 = 'val4' GROUP BY col5, col6 ORDER BY col7, col8 </code></pre>  <p>and perhaps some more complex spices, such as <code>OVER (PARTITION BY col9 ORDER by col10)</code> etc. Assume we have a lot of indexes (single and composite ones).</p>  <p>How about when columns are referred to more than others, such as</p>  <pre><code>GROUP BY col5, col6 ORDER BY col5, col7 </code></pre>  <p>will it play any role and put any preference on index of <code>col5</code> ?</p>  <p>Perhaps this kind of scenario with such column combinations is not real (for example <code>GROUP BY col5, col6 ORDER BY col7, col8</code>) but the idea is I mean a general combination in a query. Consider it like a thought experiment.</p>
