<p>I want to store time in Table and i take time(7) DataType for storing Time.</p>  <p>When i Subtract two DateTime, i got "1.18:36:36.7484253" value in my TimeSpan variable.</p>  <p>But the problem is that when i insert this value in my table i got this Error.</p>  <pre><code>SqlDbType.Time overflow.  Value '1.18:36:36.7484253' is out of range.  Must be between 00:00:00.0000000 and 23:59:59.9999999 </code></pre>  <p>I knew about this error and my question is that what type of datatype i use for this type of value for storing time.</p>  <p>I am using SQL Server 2008 and C#.</p>
