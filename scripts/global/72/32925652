<p>I'm in an SQL course for the first time and was having trouble with writing a query using the <code>leebooks.sql</code> file. I came across a solution, however I am curious because the solution I found has all the tables and columns abbreviated. When I tried to rewrite the query without abbreviations as my professor prefers, I get an error saying table doesn't exist.  I thought I rewrote it correctly, the query with the abbreviations works fine. I don't know where to upload the SQL file on here if needed?  Here are the queries:</p>  <p>With Abbreviations:  </p>  <pre><code>SELECT b.Title, bo.OrderDate,bo.OrderID FROM BOOKS b LEFT OUTER JOIN ORDER_ITEMS oi    ON b.BookID = oi.BookID LEFT OUTER JOIN BOOK_ORDER bo    ON oi.OrderID = bo.OrderID ORDER BY oi.BOOKID DESC; </code></pre>  <p>Without Abbreviations:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT BOOKS.Title, BOOK_ORDER.OrderDate, BOOK_ORDER.OrderID  FROM BOOKS  LEFT OUTER JOIN ORDER_ITEMS.OrderID    ON BOOKS.BookID = ORDER_ITEMS.BookID  LEFT OUTER JOIN BOOK_ORDER    ON ORDER_ITEMS.OrderID = BOOK_ORDER.OrderID  ORDER BY ORDER_ITEMS.BookID DESC; </code></pre>  <p>I don't understand why the second one doesn't work while the first one does if they're basically the same thing.  What am I missing?</p>
