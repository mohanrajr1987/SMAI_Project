<p>This is my table:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ohzr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ohzr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have a table named <code>term calendar</code> that has the following columns</p>  <pre><code>id         = record number schoolyear = year specificed tstart     = term start tend       = term end regenroll  = advance enrollment regend     = end of advance enrollment nenroll    = normal enrollment nend       = end of normal enrollment ienroll    = late enrollment iend       = end of late enrollment </code></pre>  <p>the dates are in format of <code>DateTime</code> on my SQL table.</p>  <p>What i want to happen is that, when the action is first called aka when the user logged in. The server's current <code>DateTime</code> will be used to compare if they are within the range of <code>tstart</code> and <code>tend</code> and i will get the <code>schoolyear</code> and <code>term</code> from that.</p>  <p>Now my question is, what should my sql/linq query be? </p>  <p>I researched about <code>DateTime</code> earlier and the examples that i found relies on the <code>where</code> clause with a pre-specified set of range but my range is from the database itself. Do i need to redesign my table?</p>
