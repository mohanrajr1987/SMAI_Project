<p>We have a web application that is hosted in IIS. In our database that serves the application we have all kinds of different data values. We are trying to figure out a way to have an email sent to a client if a certain data value exists or exceeds a threshold value.</p>  <p>Generic Example: Say we have a table that lists widgets and their 'in inventory' quantity. Every time someone sells a widget, this quantity value would be depleted. We want to send an email to the manager when the widget quantity gets below 5 and tell him to reorder more widgets.</p>  <p>We don't want to have sql triggers that check the quantity any time a 'depletion' transaction takes place. Instead, we want some type of background monitoring process that checks the level of the widgets on a timed basis. How can we accomplish this? Windows Service / WinForm application? Something built into IIS that will run ASP.net C# code?</p>
