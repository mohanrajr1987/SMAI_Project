<p>In my application I am using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>Set oRs = oConn.Execute("SET NOCOUNT ON; EXECUTE mySp;") </code></pre>  <p><code>mySp</code> returns <code>PRINT</code> messages and my application is returning them as errors.</p>  <p>How do I make it so the <code>PRINT</code> messages don't show up so it won't trigger an error in my application?</p>  <p>I tried to set <code>SET NOCOUNT ON;</code> but that doesn't seem to fix it.</p>
