<p>I have a SQL Server database, and I want to move it into the cloud and create a simple browser-independent UI for it. The details are:</p>  <ul> <li>The database is about 2GB in size. It uses SQL Server 2008, however I am happy using any later version. I have successfully restored and tested the database in more recent versions of SQL Server.</li> <li>I considered using Amazon RDS or Microsoft SQL Azure for hosting the database. Obviously I have to upload the database into the cloud, I don't mind whether this is by scripting it or restoring a BAK file, and I don't mind what version of SQL Server is provided in the cloud (as long as it's 2008+)</li> <li>The interface to the database is via one stored procedure. Information is sent to the stored procedure using an input parameter, then the SP returns a result set of 1 column and several rows.</li> <li>The database is currently hosted on a single computer, and has a simple UI where you type into an entry field and it returns several lines of text. I want to create a similar browser-based interface, eg with an entry field, a submit button to call the stored procedure, and an output area for the SP's response.</li> <li>Database connections will use SQL Server authenticated logins, as this is the only type of login available to Amazon RDS. The logins will map to a database user that has <strong>exec</strong> permission on the stored procedure, also the database user will be in the <strong>denydatareader</strong> and <strong>denydatawriter</strong> as a security measure.</li> <li>My experience is with SQL Server development, TSQL coding and database security. But beyond basic knowledge of XML / HTML, I'm not familiar with the best way of accessing the database from the cloud.</li> </ul>  <p>I welcome anyone's ideas or thoughts, or links to suitable articles if this has been asked before.</p>
