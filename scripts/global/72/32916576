<p>I'm starting a LightSwitch application using an existing SQL database.  When I bring in the tables from the database, all of the non-null columns in my tables are being interpreted as primary keys and I am not given the option to change this in the property settings.  This is not the case for an SQL view; though it will import most of my columns as primary keys, I am given the option to change the key property.</p>  <p>This has become a problem for me because it seems that when I assign one of the tables to a screen, the SQL server is bouncing back an error because lightswitch is trying to sort all of my primary keys, and some of my primary keys are strings and other non-sortable fields.  It's possible I can get away with creating multiple views to get all my read data, but I'm imagining I'm going to run into more primary key related problems when I start to do CUD operations.</p>  <p>The existing database is used for our ERP system so I am not going to be able to change any of the database configuration.</p>
