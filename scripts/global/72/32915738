<p>I’m trying to find a way to paste a dynamic list of 6800+ PersonIds from my excel spreadsheet in my SQL Server query in one go. Currently I insert them into a temp table but that requires me to break it up into sets of 1000. I’m trying to get around that. I’ve only been using SQL for about 10 months so my knowledge of what’s possible is still a work in progress.</p>  <p>I thought about a sort of reverse on an IN clause like</p>  <pre><code>Where(F.DS_ID_Key,S.DT_ID,T.DPH_ID) IN (‘00001’,’00002’,’etc’) </code></pre>  <p>but that method only allows 2 fields (as far as I know)and I need to use the 3 fields listed above. I also considered creating a variable that would pass the entire list as a string, but the string has a max character limit that is far less than what my character total would be. </p>  <p>Here is my current query. It’s actually a combination of 3 queries pulling data from 4 different tables. I have joined these 3 queries together so that the results are combined onto 1 table. All 3 queries reference the list of uniquely identifying PersonIds I mentioned above.</p>  <p>I don’t know what else to try from here.  Is there a way to pass my entire list in one go?</p>  <pre><code>IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb.dbo.#PersonIds')IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE #PersonIds CREATE TABLE #PersonIds ( Ids VarChar( 30 )) INSERT INTO #PersonIds (Ids)  VALUES ('00001'),('00002'),('00003'),etc;  SELECT F.*,S.*,T.* FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT [DS_ID]  ,[DS_ID_Key]   ,ISNULL([Original_Debt],0) AS 'ORIGINAL_OVERPAYMENT'   ,ISNULL([Current_Balance],0) AS 'CURRENT_BALANCE'   ,(ISNULL([Original_Debt],0)-ISNULL([Current_Balance],0))- ISNULL([Debt_Writeoff],0)AS 'TOTAL_COLLECTED_TO_DATE'   ,[Person_Key]   ,[First_name]   ,[Last_Name]  FROM [DATABASE1].[dbo].[DEBT_SUMMARY] JOIN [DATABASE1].[DBO].[Person_Data] ON DEBT_SUMMARY.DS_ID_Key = Person_Data.Person_Key WHERE DEBT_SUMMARY.DS_ID_Key IN (SELECT * FROM #PersonIds)  )F full outer join  ( SELECT  DISTINCT DT_NUM ,DT_ID ,SUM(ISNULL([DT_TOTAL_AMT],0)) OVER (PARTITION BY DT_NUM)AS 'FRAUD_OVERPAYMENT'  FROM [DATABASE1].[DBO].[DEBT_TYPES] WHERE DT_CAUSE_CD = '1' AND DT_ID IN (SELECT * FROM #PersonIds) GROUP BY DT_NUM,DT_ID,DT_TOTAL_AMT )S on F.DS_ID_KEY= S.DT_ID FULL OUTER JOIN  ( SELECT  DISTINCT[DPH_ID]   ,[DPH_NUM]   ,SUM(CASE WHEN DPH_POST_DT &gt;= '2015-01-01' THEN DPH_PAYMENT_AMT ELSE 0 END) AS '2015_PAYMENTS'   ,SUM(CASE WHEN DPH_POST_DT &gt; '1900-01-01' THEN DPH_PAYMENT_AMT ELSE 0 END) AS 'TOTAL_PMTS'  FROM [DATABASE1].[dbo].[DEBT_PAYMENT_HISTORY] WHERE DPH_ID IN (SELECT * FROM #PersonIds) and DPH_PAYMENT_TYPE IN ('10','20','30') GROUP BY DPH_NUM, DPH_ID )T ON S.DT_ID = T.DPH_ID ORDER BY DS_ID </code></pre>
