<p>I have been working on back end a lot lately. I find it a lot easier to directly put the JavaBeans objects in the HttpSession object on the back-end and retrieve the data using the for-each JSTL tag on the front-end, than creating JSON objects and using the getters and setters, and then parse the JSON object on the front-end.</p>  <p>Is JSON really efficient and in what way? I find it really tedious to set the JSON object and parse it.</p>
