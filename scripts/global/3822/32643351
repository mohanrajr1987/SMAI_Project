<p>I'm trying to display 2 random products to the user when he visits a product page he has previously selected. Kind of like a suggestion box.</p>  <p>To accomplish this I'm using <code>&lt;c:forEach var="product" items="${categoryProducts}" begin="0" end="1" step="1" varStatus="iter"&gt;</code></p>  <p>It works fine at displaying the first two products but it is very limited because it will always display the same two products (the first and  the second). </p>  <p>How can I give the tag a boost and make it smarter? I want the program to display 2 different products every single time... Something like <code>first-second</code> <code>third-fourth</code> and so on...</p>
