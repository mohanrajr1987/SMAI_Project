<p>I am learning how to use JSTL in my application.   </p>  <p>When i was ready download it from Internet, I found there are <strong>two kinds of JSTL</strong>. The first one is from <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/taglibs.html" rel="nofollow">http://tomcat.apache.org/taglibs.html</a>, another is <a href="https://jstl.java.net/" rel="nofollow">https://jstl.java.net/</a>. Though files' names are different, it seems they both works.    </p>  <p>What's the different between them? Which one should I use?</p>
