<p>I have a div block that uses an ng-repeat.  Within this angular loop, I need to have a  loop in JSTL, but for this inner loop I will need the current index of the angular loop.</p>  <p>So imagine that this is the basic structure:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat="foo in fooBarCtrl.blah | orderBy: '_order' track by $index"&gt;     &lt;c:forEach var="element" items="${JSTLarray[**NEED_ANGULAR_INDEX_HERE**]}"&gt;         &lt;c:out value="foobar" /&gt;     &lt;/c:forEach&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Due to the way angular and JSPs operate, I'm not sure it's even possible to gain direct access to the $index variable in my JSTL code.  However, I am trying to think of some other solution to this problem.  </p>  <p>How do I get the current index of the angular loop inside of my JSTL/EL parent loop?</p>
