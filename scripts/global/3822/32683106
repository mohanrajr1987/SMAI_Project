<p>My basic question is with JavaEE, JSP, and JSTL, how do you get user-updated information to update a bean on the controller side (i.e. in the serlvet)? </p>  <p>I am fairly new to web apps and I have read several different approaches, but I have a feeling the way I am going about it is really outdated or has some significant flaws I am overlooking.  My solution is as follows:</p>  <p>My particular bean is a Task bean with properties taskID, title, and instructions.  It actually has many more properties, but I scaled it down for the sake of the question.</p>  <pre><code>public class Task {     private int taskID;     private String title;     private String instructions;      constructor here...      getters and setters defined here... </code></pre>  <p>In the servlet I get the bean from the DAO and put it in the request:</p>  <pre><code>Task task = dao.getTaskByID(taskID); request.setAttribute("task", task); </code></pre>  <p>In the JSP page I set the corresponding inputs to the beans properties, using a hidden input for taskID.  The user sees the data, makes changes to it, and submits:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form action="./UpdateTask" method="POST"&gt;     &lt;input type="hidden" name="taskID" value="${task.taskID }"&gt;     &lt;input type="text" id="taskTitle" name="taskTitle" value="${task.title }"&gt;     &lt;input type="text" id="taskInstructions" name="taskInstructions" value="${task.instructions}"&gt;     &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Back in the controller I am get all the parameters from the request and build a bean with the updated data and then send it back to the DAO to update in the database.</p>  <pre><code>int taskID = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("taskID)); String title = request.getParameter("taskTitle"); String instructions = request.getParameter("taskInstructions");  Task updatedTask = new Task(taskID, title, instructions);  dao.updateTaskInfo(updatedTask ); </code></pre>  <p><strong>So a couple of specific questions:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Am I misunderstanding how JSTL and beans are used together?</li> <li>Is there a way to just grab the whole bean from the request without having to rebuild it like I did?</li> <li>If I do end up rebuilding the bean from request data, what if I don't want to expose some of the property values to the user (such as foreign key ids)?</li> </ul>  <p>I know asking about best practices is frowned upon, so I am not asking for the "best" way, but simply if what I've describes is an unorthodox way that deviates from standard practices.   Or if there something I am not doing that would make it simpler, or more up to speed with current practices.  </p>  <p>I have also considered making the task bean a session variable to maintain sate of the object and then just getting it back from the session after the request and updating the fields that could have changed based on user input but I worry about concurrency issues with that approach.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help.  SO is amazing in helping newbies.  There is sooooo much information out there and it changes so quickly it sure can be overwhelming to figure out what approaches to learn.</p>
