<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;ICode:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="sidebar-row"&gt;${accOverview.accDetails.iCode}&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The Above piece of code in a JSP is displaying the following outuput as ICode: xxxxxxxxxxxx(Some code here)</p>  <p>I am wondering how the piece of code is pulling the data from the tables? From my search here and there I figured out that, that might be Jquery. I tried to go through lot of manuals, nothing helped. Also I know that we are using JSTL, but I have no idea what JSTL is. This is the first time am working on UI. Can any one please explain that ?</p>
