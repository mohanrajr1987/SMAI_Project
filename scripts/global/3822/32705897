<p>Is it possible to make a forEach from the "other end" of a map? I've got a servlet that gets xml data into a map, to display it in jsp. But I need it to be shown in reverse order as I want the latest data inserted into the xml file to be the first displayed on my page.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;c:forEach var="type" items="${fetchAllWorks.allWorks}"&gt;  ${type.value.subject}  &lt;/c:url&gt;"&gt; </code></pre>
