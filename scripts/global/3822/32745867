<p>I am writing code to add a "Help" menu item if a help text file exists for a given webpage and contains a non-empty string. For some reason, I can't get the test line to work. Here is the simplified code I'm using to debug the problem:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;c:import var="data" url="${file}" /&gt; alert(${data}); &lt;c:if test="${data == 'Hello'}" /&gt;     (code to add "Help" menu item) &lt;/c:if&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The file that is being read contains 'Hello' (including the single quotes), so the test line should return true and the code to add the Help menu item should execute. The alert line displays Hello, indicating that the file has been successfully read; but the test fails, and the code to add Help menu item DOES NOT execute. I would appreciate any ideas on what I am doing wrong. As a side note, I thought that the alert line should be alert("${data}"); but it doesn't work with the quotes. </p>
