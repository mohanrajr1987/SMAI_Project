<p>I have table "Temp" and table "Today", with same column names ("url" and "date").</p>  <p>I want to update "date" column of "Temp" table when url match. But my tables are quite big (30K elements) and phpmyadmin does not want to execute the following - right - query :</p>  <pre><code>update Temp Tp inner join Today Ty on     Tp.url = Ty.url set Tp.date = Ty.date </code></pre>  <p>I get a "Query execution was interrupted, error #1317" Why ? I expect this is because I pay for a mutualized server (OVH) and I am not able to execute queries longer than 2-3 seconds.</p>  <p>Anyway, now I want to execute this query range by range. First 1000 rows, 1000-2000 etc.</p>  <p>I tried the following :</p>  <pre><code>update Temp Tp     inner join      (         select Tp2.date         from Temp Tp2             inner join Today Ty2                  on Tp2.url = Ty2.url         limit 1000     ) Ty on Tp.url = Ty.url                      set Tp.date = Ty.date </code></pre>  <p>BUT I get the following error : #1054 - Unknown column 'Ty.url' in 'on clause' </p>  <p>I couldn't find out why ?</p>
