<p>I have a sheet which calculates the total numbers for whole year. I plan to create separated sheets for each month.  </p>  <p>How can I make the Year sheet, so its calculations would automatically count the new sheet? </p>  <p>Example: 1. January - I've got general sheet/tab called YEAR 2016 and another called JAN.  2. February - at the end of February I create sheet called FEB. I want YEAR 2016 to sum positions in these two sheets by automatically expanding formulas range.</p>  <p>Preferably without VBA.</p>
