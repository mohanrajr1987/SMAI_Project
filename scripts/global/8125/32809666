<p>I am trying to generate large volume numbers (In serial) between 2122334690000166340863 and 2122396090000914537739. I used range function but it cannot do such due to memory failure. Instead I used xrange function but It gives me incorrect numbers like 2147483648 2147483647 2147483646 2147483645. </p>  <p>Can someone tell me how to achieve this? Below is what I tried. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;? foreach (xrange(2122334690000166340863, 2122396090000914537739) as $number) {     echo "$number "; } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>EDIT: To be very precise, How do I generate arbitrary numbers between a range?</p>
