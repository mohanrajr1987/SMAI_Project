<p>I've been looking on StackOverflow for a solution to this problem and I'm almost there but I can't seem to solve my last problem: saving only a specific worksheet to a new file. Basically, what I want to do is the following:</p>  <ol> <li>User clicks and "Archive Data" button</li> <li>User is prompted to choose a filepath and "SaveAs" a new Excel workbook</li> <li>Code will copy the range of data in the current worksheet</li> <li>Code will paste that range to the new Excel workbook specified in the "SaveAs"</li> </ol>  <p>My problem is that it saves the whole workbook and I have no way of copying and pasting/saving the specific range in the desired worksheet. Please see the code for reference and let me know if you have any questions.</p>  <pre><code>Sub ArchiveData()  Dim ThisFile As String Dim NewFile As String Dim ActBook As Workbook Dim NewShtName As String Dim NewFileType As String NewShtName = "Archived Data on " &amp; Format(Date, "MM.DD.YYYY")  'Copy ThisFile = ThisWorkbook.FullName NewFileType = "Excel 1997-2003 (*.xls), *.xls,Excel 2007-2013 (*.xlsx), .*xlsx,Excel 2007-2013 Macro-Enabled (*.xlsm), .*xlsm)" NewFile = Application.GetSaveAsFilename(InitialFileName:=NewFileName, FileFilter:=NewFileType)  'Paste If NewFile = "False" Then     MsgBox ("File unable to be saved")     Exit Sub Else     ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(2).SaveAs Filename:=NewFile, FileFormat:=51 'Need to save as .xls and/or .xlsx     ThisWorkbook.Sheets(2).range("A4:S65536").Copy     ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(1).range("A4:S65536").PasteSpecial (xlPasteValues)     ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(1).Name = NewShtName      'Close new book     Set ActBook = ActiveWorkbook     Workbooks.Open ThisFile     ActBook.Close  End If MsgBox ("File saved") End Sub </code></pre>
