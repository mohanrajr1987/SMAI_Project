<pre><code>// Input array $arr = [     'A' =&gt; '9-11',     'B' =&gt; '9-12',     'C' =&gt; '12-14',     'D' =&gt; '13-14',     'E' =&gt; '15-16',     'F' =&gt; '15-16',     'G' =&gt; '13-14',     'H' =&gt; '14-16' ];  // ranges $start = 9; $end = 16;  // Desired outputs: A + C + E (9-11, 12-14, 15-16) A + C + F (9-11, 12-14, 15-16) A + C + H (9-11, 12-14, 14-16)  B + D + E (9-12, 13-14, 15-16) B + G + F (9-12, 13-14, 15-16) B + G + H (9-12, 13-14, 14-16) </code></pre>  <p>So it means, Every combination MUST start with 9 ( as we <code>$start = 9</code> ) and try to get upto 16 ( ie. the <code>$end = 16</code> IF AVAILABLE ) with <code>n</code> elements in each combination( here, <code>n = 3</code>).</p>  <p>I googled many problems and tried something of myself. But unfortunately, they didn't even get a lil bit closer of the solution. The problem I'm working is different from above example and complex. But if I get your precious help on above case, I will be able to fix actual problem.</p>  <p>Please Help me with this.</p>  <p>Note: Kindly request, I don't need down votes, I need the solutions. So I'm begging for solution.</p>
