<p>I am perplexed why my global variable within a module fall out of scope at the conclusion of a sub procedure. </p>  <p>I declare the range at the top of the module out side of all subproc and functions  as below </p>  <pre><code>Option Explicit  Dim TIMEDATA As Range Dim FREQDATA As Range  Const StartLoc = "B4" Const flowLoc = "F4" Const dtLoc = "J8" </code></pre>  <p>In my subproc I define one of the ranges. </p>  <pre><code>Public Sub PortandConvertData()  &lt;SNIP&gt;  Set TIMEDATA = calcSheet.Range(Cells(2, 2).Address, Cells(2 + dataSize, 2).Address)  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>After the sub completes in the watch window I see the variable TIMEDATA go from  Range/Range to Range and the value go from correct to simply out of context. </p>  <p>I want to store data in the module rather than pasting in a sheet or something. </p>  <p>Any help is much appreciated</p>
