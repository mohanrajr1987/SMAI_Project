<p>Tech specs: ruby 2.1.5p273, Rails 4.2.3.</p>  <p>I have an array of Days that I want to loop through to pick the right Exits (model) that fall within a date range. </p>  <ul> <li><p>@exits has :start_date and :end_date</p></li> <li><p>@days is an array of dates like:</p>  <p>=> [Sun, 06 Sep 2015, Sat, 12 Sep 2015, Tue, 15 Sep 2015, Fri, 18 Sep 2015, Sat, 19 Sep 2015, Sun, 20 Sep 2015, Wed, 23 Sep 2015]</p></li> </ul>  <p>I thought something like this would work: </p>  <pre><code>@days.each do |day|   @exits.where(:start_date..:end_date).include?(day) end </code></pre>  <p>but I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: Cannot visit Range </code></pre>  <p>What is the best way to query an object that has a date range (between two fields) by comparing it against a single date? Thanks!</p>
