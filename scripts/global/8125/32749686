<p>So, Im trying to make a query that will count how many days belong in different seasons. Its for site that's about booking apartments and it can have multiple seasons one after another. For example:</p>  <p>| Season_id |   From     |   Till     |</p>  <p> |   1    | 2015-09-01 | 2015-09-30 | </p>  <p> |   2    | 2015-09-30 | 2015-10-20 | </p>  <p> |   3    | 2015-10-30 | 2015-12-30 | </p>  <p>So when someone is searching to book for date ex.:</p>   <p>2015-09-25 - 2015-10-10.</p>  <p></p>  <p>I want to get result like: </p>  <p> Seasons:   1, 2 </p>  <p> Count days:  5, 10 </p>      <p>Is it possible to do that with one query or it must be multiple??</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
