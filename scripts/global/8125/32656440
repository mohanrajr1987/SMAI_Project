<p>I have hundreds of thousands of IP's and want to identify which ones are within a certain range.  Ranges:</p>  <pre><code>64.233.160.0 /  8192 66.102.0.0 / 4096 66.249.64.0 / 8192 72.14.192.0 / 16384 74.125.0.0  / 65536 209.85.128.0 / 32768 216.239.32.0 / 8192 </code></pre>  <p>So I converted these ranges to the following:</p>  <pre><code>64.233.160.0    -   64.233.192.0 66.102.0.0      -   66.102.16.0 66.249.64.0     -   66.249.96.0 72.14.192.0     -   72.15.0.0 74.125.0.0      -   74.126.0.0 209.85.128.0    -   209.86.0.0 216.239.32.0    -   216.239.64.0 </code></pre>  <p>So now I want to query if an IP address is within any of these ranges. SQL isn't going to understand the octets so I don't know what to do.</p>  <p>Could use some Hex2Dec/Dec2Hex conversions?</p>  <p>I figure this should be something that has been done before, I'm sure I'm not the first person to try and identify particular ip's in a list using an ip range.</p>  <p>I will be doing look ups on multiple IP addresses so some might be 20.0.1.123 and another might be 124.123.123.1 ie the format of the octets won't be the same</p>
