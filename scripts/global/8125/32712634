<p>I am trying to make a graph in OpenOffice Calc of soil properties versus depth. There are different layers of soil with different properties. I do this analysis to know the extent of these layers, i.e. I don't know the extent yet.  </p>  <p>I am wondering, if there is a way / how to, instead of manually typing the data range for the graph in a pop-up window, just input a link to a particular cell, where the data range is generated automatically by a function?  </p>  <p>In other words, I input two numbers into two cells, which correspond to the upper and lower limits in the table of values, and this generates a data range in a third cell which is used for generating the graph.</p>
