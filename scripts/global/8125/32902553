<p>Is it possible to assign ranges to a matrix. If you consider the below zeros matrix as a 'grid' for plotting:</p>  <pre><code>R = zeros(5,8); R = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 </code></pre>  <p>So can you treat this matrix as a grid so each x-axis zero can considered as a range? for example <code>R(5,1)</code> is a range <code>0-0.1 seconds</code>. <code>R(5,2)</code> is a range <code>0.1-0.2 seconds</code> etc.</p>  <p>Can the range idea also be applied to the columns? </p>  <p>The purpose for this is so I can read cell array data I have already organised into ranges into the zeros matrix to produce a 2d histogram.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0mkZf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0mkZf.png" alt="Example of my output"></a></p>
