<p>I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 with multiple NICs, each NIC is connected to a different server, so each NIC is a completely isolated network, but they have the same IP range (192.168.10.X). I've created several static routes (see the image bellow) for when I do a ssh session I can connect without any issues.</p>  <p>The issue I'm facing is even with the static routes the only server I can connect is the first one (192.168.10.4)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FafP.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FafP.png</a></p>  <p>To add a route I used the following command: route add 192.168.10.X mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.10.Z metric Y if xy</p>  <p>wy - interface number X - Interface of the server I'm trying to reach Z - The local server interface connected to the other server Y - the metric I used is N+1 (first route I used metric 1 and the metric 2, etc)</p>
