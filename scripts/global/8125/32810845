<p>Can someone please help getting the right formula for situation as this below:</p>  <ul> <li>10 boys get 10 apples - results in 0</li> <li>10 boys get 8 apples - below 0, but max -1 </li> <li>10 boys get 14 apples - above 0, but max 1</li> </ul>  <p>I can get first two parts of formula right: </p>  <ul> <li>when 10 boys get 10 apples, results in 0</li> <li>when 10 boys get 8 apples, -0.2, </li> </ul>  <p>formula <code>=IF(B1&gt;A1,(A1-B1)*(-1/A1),</code><strong><em>(B1-A1)</em>(1/A1)*</strong><code>)</code></p>  <p>However, when 10 boys get 14 apples (bolded in formula), the result is nonsense because it exceeds 1 (if the number of apples are over 20), but it should at all times be in range from 0 to 1 (proportionally).</p>  <blockquote>   <p>UPDATED: thank you guys for insights, final formula below   <code>=IF(A1&lt;B1,B1÷A1−1,A1÷B1)</code></p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>tigeravatar</strong>, thank you! I will use your formula too:  <code>=IF(A1&gt;B1,B1÷A1−1,1−A1÷B1)</code></p>
