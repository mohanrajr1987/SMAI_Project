<p>For a programming class, I have to convert a range of values to a switch statement without using if/else ifs. Here are the values that I need to convert to cases:</p>  <p>0 to 149 ............. $10.00 <br> 150 to 299 .........$15.00 <br> 300 to 449 .........$25.00 <br> 550 to 749..........$40.00 <br> 750 to 1199........$65.00 <br> 2000 and above.....$85.00</p>  <p>I am having difficulty finding a way to separate the values since they are so close in number (like 149 to 150). </p>  <p>I have used plenty of algorithms such as dividing the input by 2000, and then multiplying that by 10 to get a whole number, but they are too close to each other to create a new case for. </p>
