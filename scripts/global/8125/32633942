<p>I am trying to write a function in Excel that will return what the Section Number for a given value would be. For instance the <code>1200</code> value would fall in Section Number 1, and so on. I am trying to stay away from writing a VBA function to do this.  </p>  <p>So what would be a good way to do this? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vP6P8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vP6P8.png" alt="Section Number"></a></p>
