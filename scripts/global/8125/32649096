<p>The problem I have is the following : I have a set of subtitles, each with a start and end time. I'm looking for an efficient way to determine, given a time value, which subtitle should be displayed.</p>  <p>Ranges and TreeRangeSet quickly emerged as the way to go, but unfortunately the Range class turned out to be not "extendable", in order for me to add a String attribute to it. The idea was :</p>  <ol> <li>Constructs all customRanges, CustomRange(startTime, endTime, subtitle), and add those to my TreeRangeSet</li> <li>Given a timePosition, get the CustomRange : treeRangeSet.rangeContaining(timePosition)</li> <li>Finally, if customRange is not null, return customRange.getSubtitle()</li> </ol>  <p>Now I could do something like wrap my Ranges in CustomRanges and store those in a list beside my TreeRangeSet. This way after receiving a Range from my treeRangeSet I could lookup the corresponding CustomRange and therefore obtain the subtitle String. But this would make using a TreeRangeSet completely useless ^^</p>  <p>My question is can I still use Range and TreeRangeSet to solve my problem, but maybe in a more clever way ? Or are their other alternatives to those classes ? My goal is to avoid having to implement from scratch the tree structure myself.</p>
