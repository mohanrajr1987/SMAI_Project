<p>I have the following code written in VBA:</p>  <pre><code>For Each W In Range("B5:B15000").Cells     If W.Offset(-1, 0).Value - W.Value &gt; 1.5 Then         W.Offset(-1, 0).EntireRow.Delete     End If Next W </code></pre>  <p>The intent is to iterate down 'Column B', between Rows 5 and 15000, subtracting each of the current 'W' values from the Offset 'W' values. If the resultant difference from the equation is greater than 1.5 then delete the entire following 'W'(Offset) row. If the difference is less than or equal to 1.5, move on to the next 'W'.</p>  <p>For a better understanding of the data set, column B is essentially a time stamp series. As you go further down the column, the time stamp increases in varying amounts of seconds. I need to pick out the gaps (so to speak) that are greater than 1.5 seconds and delete them. </p>  <p>Here is a sample of the column data:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rsthy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rsthy.png" alt="data sample"></a></p>  <p>The task seems simple enough, but I am receiving a 'Type Mismatch' error. I am relatively new to the For Each loop, so I do not quite understand what portions are mismatched.</p>
