<p>I have a Waveform Chart in Labview. I know that I can change its range using the "Plot History Length" property. The problem is that I don't add the points to the plot regularly, so I can't compute the number of point I want to be displayed.</p>  <p>Is there a way to inform Labview that I want only the points from last, let's say, 20 minutes to be displayed?</p>  <p>I want to display an absolute time, so setting range to 20 min won't help.</p>
