<p>I'm trying to replace the just first character of a string. Using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24200888/any-way-to-replace-characters-on-swift-string#">this answer</a>, I'm able to replace all current characters with the one I want, but what I really need is to only replace the character if it's at the start of a word.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>For example, replace c with t:</strong>  </p>  <p>Original String: Jack is cool<br> New Sting: Jack is tool  </p>  <hr>  <p><strong>My Current Code:</strong></p>  <pre><code>let aString: String = "jack is cool" let toArray: Array = aString.componentsSeparatedByString(" ") let newString: String = aString.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString("c", withString: "t", options: NSStringCompareOptions.LiteralSearch, range: nil) </code></pre>  <p>This would print out as:</p>  <pre><code>"jatk is tool" </code></pre>  <p>I assume I have to do something with the range attribute in the newString.</p>
