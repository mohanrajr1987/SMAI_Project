<p>I have the following code which scans a list of raw data and for each line and if date and var (a variant I defined) are correct the row is copied and placed into the correct destination. This line to copy row is commented out. The macro worked but instead of copying the whole row I've now attempted (in the 2 lines above the commented out .copy row) to select only specific cells in the row (cells in iRow and columns M,N,O,Q,R,U,V,AB). I get the error: Wrong number of arguments or invalid property assignment. I know this is related to the 2 new lines of code I input because previously the code worked fine. Any help is appreciated, thanks!</p>  <pre><code>Sub currentMonthDetail()  Dim csCount As Range Dim b As Variant Dim shrow As Long Dim iRow As Long, iRowL As Long, var As Variant, iDate As Variant Dim bln As Boolean Dim s As String Dim eRow As Integer Dim i As Integer  'Import monthly data from GL008 tab to detail-----------------------------------------------------------------  Set csCount = Worksheets("Input").Range("csCount")  Sheets("GL008").Activate  iRowL = Cells(rows.count, 1).End(xlUp).Row  For iRow = 2 To iRowL     Sheets("GL008").Activate     If Not IsEmpty(Cells(iRow, 35)) Then         bln = False         var = Application.Match(Cells(iRow, 35).Value, Worksheets("Input").Columns(3), 0)         iDate = Sheets("GL008").Cells(iRow, 34)         If Not CVErr(var) = CVErr(xlErrNA) And iDate = Worksheets("Input").Range("E3") Then         Sheets("GL008").Activate         Range("M" &amp; iRow, "N" &amp; iRow, "O" &amp; iRow, "Q" &amp; iRow, "R" &amp; iRow, "U" &amp; iRow, "V" &amp; iRow, "AB" &amp; iRow).copy         'Sheets("GL008").rows(iRow).copy         s = Sheets("GL008").Cells(iRow, 35)         Sheets(s).Activate         eRow = Sheets(s).Cells(rows.count, 1).End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).Row         ActiveSheet.Paste Destination:=Sheets(s).rows(eRow)         End If     End If   Next iRow </code></pre>
