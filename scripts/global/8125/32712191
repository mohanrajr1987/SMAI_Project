<p>I'm very new to coding and really confused about this. I'm supposed to take exactly two arguments, which are a first and last value for a range of integers, and print out all of the squares of that range. I know how to calculate the square but I keep getting the ArrayOutOfBoundsException which I am not suppose to get and I don't understand how you are supposed to declare the 2 arguments and calculate all of the numbers in the range. I would post my code but my professor has a really strict policy about posting code online. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
