<pre><code>public class Dash {     public void readFile(String fil) throws FileNotFoundException {         try {             Scanner input = new Scanner(new File(fil));             String text = input.next();             input.close();         } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {         }     }      public int getNumDashes() throws FileNotFoundException {         readFile(fil);         String text = input.next();         // code to find number of dashes from the string of the read file.     } } </code></pre>  <p>As indicated in the title, I would like to read the file in one method. Since I cannot return a string from <code>readFile</code> method, I would have to obtain the string from within the <code>getNumDashes</code> method. However, I'm not sure how to do this. I would like my second method's return value to be based of off whatever file name is passed into <code>readFile()</code>.</p>
