<p>I am trying to create a file named "test.txt" in a folder named "test" in the current directory and append some lines of text into it.  </p>  <p>I am using this code segment in a program but getting an exception saying that the <code>file is already in use by another process</code>. Is there any problem in this segment?</p>  <pre><code>DateTime now = DateTime.Now;              string time = now.ToString(); string id="test"; string path2 = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, id); string path=Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(); string FileName = Path.Combine(path2, id + ".txt"); File.Create(FileName); string fullPathName2 = Path.GetFullPath(FileName);              File.AppendAllText(fullPathName2, time + Environment.NewLine); </code></pre>
