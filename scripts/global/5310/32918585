<p>I have read many posts on here and done many Google searches but I am still unable to read a file from another java package within my current project.</p>  <p>In one of my classes I have the following code, however the input stream is always null. I have tried using the context class loader, as well as many other solutions but to no avail.</p>  <pre><code>InputStream is = this.getClass().getResourceAsStream( "opcodes.txt" );   System.out.println(is); </code></pre>  <p>Another attempt was:</p>  <pre><code>InputStream is = ClassName.class.getResourcceAsStream("/resources/opcodes.txt"); </code></pre>  <p>which also returned null.</p>  <p>Any help or explanation for why I can not find the file within a resource package would be great.</p>  <p>p.s. I am using eclipse if that makes a difference.</p>  <p>EDIT: If I use an OpenFileDialog to find the file, I am able to open and read it, so the file does exist and is not corrupt.</p>
