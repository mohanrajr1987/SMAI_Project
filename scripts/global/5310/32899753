<p>I've been working for quite a while on this, but can't seem to get why the files sample_uc_students.txt and sample_smc_grads.txt are not being read. They're premade documents I put into my documents folder but they're not opening.</p>  <pre><code>Student* readStudentsFromFile(string filename, int num) { ifstream studentsStream; studentsStream.open(filename.c_str()); if (!studentsStream.is_open()) {     cerr &lt;&lt; "Couldn't open the file " &lt;&lt; filename &lt;&lt; endl;     return NULL; } // create a new array of students with size 'num' Student* students = new Student[num]; string name, school, sid; int id; // read student records from file for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) {     getline(studentsStream, name, ',');     getline(studentsStream, sid, ',');     getline(studentsStream, school);     istringstream idConv(sid);     idConv &gt;&gt; id;     // create a student object from the record and store it in the array     students[i] = Student(id, name, school); } studentsStream.close(); return students; }  int main() {  const int SIZE = 10; const int SMC_SIZE = 5; const int SMC_UC_GRADS_SIZE = 2; Student* uc = readStudentsFromFile("sample_uc_students.txt", UC_SIZE); Student* smc = readStudentsFromFile("sample_smc_grads.txt", SMC_SIZE);  \Time it will take time_t start, end;  time(&amp;start); Student* common1 = findCommonStudents1(uc, UC_SIZE, smc, SMC_SIZE,                                        SMC_UC_GRADS_SIZE); time(&amp;end); cout &lt;&lt; "Using linear search it took " &lt;&lt; difftime(end, start) &lt;&lt; " seconds." &lt;&lt; endl;  /*  * library sort function to sort an array: sort(arr, arr+size)  * Note that values must be comparable with the &lt; operator  */    sort(common1, common1 + SMC_UC_GRADS_SIZE); writeStudentsToFile(common1, SMC_UC_GRADS_SIZE, "smc_grads_at_uc_1.txt");  time(&amp;start); Student* common2 = findCommonStudents2(uc, UC_SIZE, smc, SMC_SIZE,                                        SMC_UC_GRADS_SIZE); time(&amp;end); cout &lt;&lt; "Using binary search it took " &lt;&lt; difftime(end, start) &lt;&lt; " seconds." &lt;&lt; endl;  sort(common2, common2 + SMC_UC_GRADS_SIZE); writeStudentsToFile(common2, SMC_UC_GRADS_SIZE, "smc_grads_at_uc_2.txt");  delete[] smc; delete[] uc; delete[] common1; delete[] common2; return 0;  } </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions on how to get these to open or perhaps I should try to open them through a path?</p>
