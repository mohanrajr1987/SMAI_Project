<p>I am trying to use the StringTokenizer to set a comma as the delimiter with lines from a file, each consisting of a zipcode and city (e.x. 01221, Washington, DC), but I don't want the second comma to be a delimiter since it is part of the city name.  I have 2 classes in which I read in the zip code and city name, but I'm not sure how to correctly use the tokenizer to set the zip code and city apart.  I want to return 1 array of each the zip code and city from each class so I don't want to combine them into one class.  I am also not sure if I should put the tokenizer in my main method or not.</p>  <pre><code>public static String[] getZipCodes (File zips, Scanner hi, int d) {     //creating array of zip codes with the length of the number of lines     String[] zipCodes=new String[d];     //Loops through each zip code to fill the array     for (int i=0; i&lt;d; i++)     {         zipCodes[i]=hi.next();         System.out.println(zipCodes[i]);     }     return zipCodes; }  public static String[] getCities (File zips, Scanner hi, int d) {     //creating array of cities     String[] cities=new String[d];     //fills array with city names, parallel to its zip code     for (int i=0; i&lt;d; i++)     {         hi.next();         cities[i]=hi.next();         hi.nextLine();     }     return cities; } </code></pre>  <p>Here is the main method:</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {     File zips=new File("ZipCodesCity.txt");     //Scanner to count number of lines in file     Scanner in=new Scanner(zips);      //Counting number of zip codes     int codenum=0;     while (in.hasNextLine())     {         codenum++;     }      //making a second scanner to read in the zip codes     Scanner hi= new Scanner(zips);      //initializing array of zip codes     String[]zipCodes=getZipCodes(zips, hi, codenum);      //Tokenizer     StringTokenizer wrd=new StringTokenizer(hi.nextLine(), ","); } </code></pre>
