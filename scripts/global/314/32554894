<p>I've run into an issue where I need to communicate between a class that is a subclass of nstextfield and the view controller I am using in a cocoa swift project.</p>  <p>The subclassed nstextfield changes the size of it's frame. The field itself is within a table within the view controller. Essentially, when the nstextfield changes its frame size, I want the view controller to become aware of that. I'm able to signal to the view controller that the frame has changed via the use of Nsnotification Centre where an observer in the view controller listens for the notification, that works fine. But now when that notification is triggered, I need to view controller to return to the subclassed nstextfield in order to retrieve the size of the frame. I don't believe that I can pass for example a frame size with the notification message.</p>  <p>Can anyone give me an idea as to how I retrieve the frame size of the nstextfield from within the view controller?</p>  <p>Thanks for your assistance in advance.</p>
