<p>I have a problem with QTextDocument::size()</p>  <p>The size of the document is updated every time user enters something to TextEdit manually. (So in SIGNAL <strong>textChanged</strong> it works fine). However, I insert some text by code.</p>  <pre><code>textEdit-&gt;insertPlainText("blablablabla\n"); </code></pre>  <p>When I use this:</p>  <pre><code>int iHeight = textEdit-&gt;document()-&gt;size().height(); </code></pre>  <p>The iHeight is always equal to 21, even though the textEdit has multiple lines of text. When I use the same line of code in the SIGNAL i talked about, the iHeight magically turns into the correct number.</p>  <p>So basically, my question is how to update the document's size so it returns proper number?</p>
