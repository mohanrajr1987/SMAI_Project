<p>I have tried this with an empty project. Integrating the FacebookSDK.a lib which is linked by the official Unity Facebook plugin makes the size of the <strong>installed app</strong> (appname.app) jump from 8~9MB to 70MB.</p>  <p>Note that I am not talking about ipa size which stays normal, but really the installed app size.</p>  <p>I don't think this is normal and I am wondering if there is a way not to link the FacebookSDK.a and do it with the normal FBSDKCoreKit.framework instead ? or actually any other way that doesn't have such a huge impact on installed app size.</p>
