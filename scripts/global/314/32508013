<p>I created an iPhone app and after archiving it, adding it to iTunes, showing it in the Finder, I got the ipa file that is 23.9 MBs in size. I un-archived it using The Unarchiver and got the Payload folder. Inside it, along other files, i got a 7.1 MB Assets.car file, a 9.5 MB exec file (project's name) and a 40.1 MB Frameworks folder. I used different softwares to compress my PNGs (ImgOptim, ImgAlpha, TinyPNG), and I also tried changing COMPRESS_PNG_FILES to no, but it didn't affect the size</p>  <p>Is this normal? I used import UIKit, Foundation and AVFoundation inside my classes. (currently using Xcode 7 Beta 3, waiting for the GM download to finish)</p>  <p><strong>EDIT :</strong> I'm going to add the StartApp SDK for ads later on. Will the size increase a lot? And do you recommend StartApp or other websites to display ads on the app with a high revenue for me?</p>
