<p>I want to make my players become bigger or smaller in diameter when they eat a good(theBall2) or bad ball(theBadBall) respectively. ive created a hitTestObject function where I tried to make the ball get smaller and bigger but it doesnâ€™t work. </p>  <pre><code>          var player1;           var player2;           var player3;           var theBall2;           var theBadBall;           player1 = new player(50,384, 1);           player2 = new player(944,384,2);           player3 = new player(488,84,3);           stage.addChild(player1);           stage.addChild(player2);           stage.addChild(player3);           var player.width: player.width * 2; // 1086 syntax error: expecting semicolon before dot.           var player.height:player.height * 2;// 1086 syntax error: expecting semicolon before dot.          //this function checks to see if theBall2 has collided with a player         if(theBall2.hitTestObject(player1) || theBall2.hitTestObject(player2) || theBall2.hitTestObject(player3))         {             //removes the ball from the stage             trace("a player has eaten a ball");             stage.removeChild(theBall2);             //adds new ball             theBall2 = new ball2();             theBall2.x = stage.stageWidth/2;             theBall2.y = stage.stageHeight/2;             stage.addChild( theBall2 );             //makes player larger             player.width =  player.width * 4; // do I have to define player1, player2, player3, instead of their class player?             player.height =  player.height * 4;         }          //this function checks to see if theBadBall has collided with a player         if(theBadBall.hitTestObject(player1) || theBadBall.hitTestObject(player2) || theBadBall.hitTestObject(player3))         {             //removes thebadball from the stage             trace("a player has eaten bad ball");             stage.removeChild(theBadBall);             //adds new ball             theBadBall = new badball();             theBadBall.x = stage.stageWidth/2;             theBadBall.y = stage.stageHeight/2;             stage.addChild(theBadBall);             //makes player smaller             player.width =  player.width / 2;             player.height =  player.height / 2;         } </code></pre>  <p>How do I make it work?</p>
