<p>Please may I ask if anyone would recommend a sample size calculator for a survey?  I am looking to sample a selected portion of the overall organization.  As I know there are statistical differences in the survey results based on demographic and location factors (from past surveys), I plan stratified sampling.  However, to determine the margin or error of using sample of 20% (denominator is full organization population)  vs. 40% vs. 60% are there any reliable calculators out there? In addition, to which specific calculators, it would be great to understand whether there is empirical support that these calculators produce reliable results? Thanks,   </p>
