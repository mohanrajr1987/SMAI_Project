<p>I am creating a landing page using the "The Landing Page" theme in Wordpress. <a href="http://www.seniorcarecompliance.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.seniorcarecompliance.com</a> The issue I am having is regarding any photos I add, either upload directly to Wordpress or using links from Photobucket, and when I add media using the Visual Editor widget in Page Builder it is not letting me resize images at all. In fact it is forcing the image size, whether I have cropped before using a different program or in Wordpress, to the largest it can go and making my images way too big. Any time I try to resize using the Media Manager whether it is Full Size, Thumbnail, or Custom nothing happens. Even if I drag the size smaller or larger in the visual editor nothing happens. And again I have tried changing the size and dimensions with Photoshop and re-uploading with the new file size and still the same thing happens.</p>  <p>I have been googling all morning and haven't found a solution to my problem. Maybe I am typing the wrong phrases in. I don't know. I also am not sure if this is a Page Builder issue although I have built many sites without Page Builder and have never seemed to have this problem using Wordpress' Visual Editor. Is there an easy solution to this problem? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>  <p>URL: <a href="http://seniorcarecompliance.com/" rel="nofollow">http://seniorcarecompliance.com/</a></p>
