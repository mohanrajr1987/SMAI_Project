<p>I've a macro that I used with some ppt's in office 2007 to reduce the size of some links within the ppt to an excel file. Recently I've installed the Office 2013 and the macro crashed with the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Shape.select: invalid request. To select a shape, its view must be active </p> </blockquote>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub reduce()  For Each curr_slide In ActivePresentation.Slides      curr_slide.Select        For Each oSh In curr_slide.Shapes            If oSh.Type = msoLinkedOLEObject Then             Set oSh = curr_slide.Shapes(3)               With oSh                    '.LinkFormat.BreakLink                     .Select                    .LockAspectRatio = False                    .Height = 14 * 28.33                    .Width = 33.5 * 28.33                    .Cut                    Set oSh = curr_slide.Shapes.PasteSpecial(DataType:=ppPastePNG)                    .Height = 10 * 28.33                    .Width = 23 * 28.33                    .Left = 1.2 * 28.33                    .Top = 1.85 * 28.33                    .ZOrder (msoSendToBack)                End With            End If        Next oSh    Next curr_slide End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I believe now, I've to activate each shape in every slide but I don't know how to do it.</p>
