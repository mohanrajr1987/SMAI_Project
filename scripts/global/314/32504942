<p>I'm a new Python user (this is my first post at stackoverflow) and have some problems understanding the different types of variables in python. Previously I have mostly used Matlab for the tasks I want to do but there are some differences in Python, I think.</p>  <p>I do some matrix operations, resulting in array (list?) "ahs", then the three first elements of "ahs" are stored in scalar variables "a, b, c" (scalar is what I call them, may not be correct.., their content is just different numbers, 2, 3e6, -10 etc).</p>  <p>Then I want to plot a quadratic curve, but the two arrays (?..) "xh" (from linspace) and "sh" (from quadratic expression) have different size (or type?) and can't be plotted. When examined individual elements of "sh" seems to be correct and my guess is that the plot problem refers to size issues.</p>  <pre><code>  a=ahs[0]   b=ahs[1]   c=ahs[2]                xh=np.linspace(0,x3,num=100)   sh=a*xh**2+b*xh+c    print(np.shape(xh))   print(np.shape(sh)) </code></pre>  <p>The output I get:</p>  <pre><code>(100,) (1, 100) raise ValueError("x and y must have same first dimension") ValueError: x and y must have same first dimension </code></pre>  <p>This is most likely very simple to fix, but I just can't figure it out how to get variable "sh" to be of shape (100,).</p>  <p>Thanks, Erik</p>
