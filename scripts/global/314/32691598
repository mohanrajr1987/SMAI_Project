<p>I wanted to download an Excel from the .jsp file in my application. I have added the following lines to all my JSP's:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;%@ page contentType="application/vnd.ms-excel" %&gt;    response.setHeader("Pragma", "No-cache");   response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");   response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); </code></pre>  <p>I am able to download now but, in some pages I am able to see the size while downloading and in some not able to. I want all the pages with the size.  </p>  <p>Can anyone please help me?</p>
