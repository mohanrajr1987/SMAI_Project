<p>Icon sets keep coming out huge, is this standard? The files within the ico container are very small.  Is there anything I can do to reduce the file size of the icon set?</p>  <p>icoconvert.com --  multi-image to one icon, 6 very small files, ico came out to 135k!!</p>  <p>ImageMagick --  convert.exe image-16.png image-32.png fancy.ico --  individual file sizes total 1.5k, ico size 5.3k!</p>  <p>-- convert.exe sfp-16.png sfp-32.png sfp-48.png sfp-64.png sfp.ico --  4 individual file sizes tiny, largest is 835 bytes, ico file size 31.2k!</p>  <p>While ImageMagick obviously did a better job than icoconvert as far as bucket size goes, still it seems like it is using a moving van to hold what should fit in a standard envelope.  New project is counting every byte for mobile-first dev data considerations.  </p>  <p>Any help please?</p>  <p>Thank you, Beth</p>
