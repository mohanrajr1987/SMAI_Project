<p>I just recently got familiar with eclipse and all I'm trying to do is change the color and font size for some text files. </p>  <p>I have a simple project and it has some menu buttons. when I click on them they load some text files saved in a folder (obviously in .txt format). I searched everywhere for the answer and I was hoping to find it right away but all those questions out there regarding the font size and color are either the eclipse overall font change or the coding text color changes.</p>  <p>The question is, how can I change the color and font size for each and every part of the text ? I even tried some html code inside the text file but it didn't work...</p>  <p>any idea ?</p>
