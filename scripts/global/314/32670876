<p>I have some labels and a textview that are set to be uninstalled for compact width and installed for any other size class. They are part of a cell in a tableview. Using the app on the simulator, they are correctly uninstalled for iPhone in portrait. By clicking on the cell, the app navigates to new view. Upon navigating back, with the iPhone still in portrait, the labels and text views are now visible, even though they should be uninstalled for the current size class. Navigating forward (by clicking on a cell) and back again shows the correct display. Repeated back and forth navigation alternates between correct and incorrect display of these components.</p>  <p>The correct landscape and portrait look as follows.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9fM0h.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9fM0h.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wDLqI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wDLqI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>After navigating back the portrait incorrectly looks as follows: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RKGWv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RKGWv.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Finally, I should mention that switching to landscape and back to portrait corrects the error and returns the view to the correct constraints. </p>  <p>Any idea why this happens or how to fix it? Thanks</p>
