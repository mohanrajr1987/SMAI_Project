<pre><code>1 Byte = 8bits 1 Halfword = 16bits = 2 Bytes 1 Word = 32 bits = 4 Bytes 1 Long = 64 bits = 8 Bytes </code></pre>  <p>But then in x86 Assembly (AT&amp;T syntax), I use movw (move word) to move a Halfword to a 16 bit register, movl (move long) to move a word to a 32 bits register. I'm using a virtual machine on a 64 bits OS running a 32 bits OS.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong? </p>  <p>Does that mean in the OS running in my VM the sizes are:</p>  <pre><code>1 Byte = 4bits 1 Halfword = 8bits = 2 Bytes 1 Word = 16 bits = 4 Bytes 1 Long = 32 bits = 8 Bytes </code></pre>  <p>I checked on GDB the sizes and I think they were:</p>  <pre><code>1 Byte = 8bits 1 Halfword = 16bits = 2 Bytes 1 Word = 32 bits = 4 Bytes 1 Long = 64 bits = 8 Bytes  </code></pre>  <p>Thank you.</p>
