<p>In RSA algorithm the plain text length is 6, encrypted text length is 128. how the file size increases after encryption? If you want more security then you got much bigger encrypted files sizes,comparatively than the original! is it true?. AES don't have that much changes on file size after encryption. What are all the other standards increases the file size after encryption? kindly help me</p>
