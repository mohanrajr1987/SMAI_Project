<p>The goal of my code is to find useful frames in a video. It currently works, but it's annoyingly truncating the labels on my two trackbars. </p>  <p>This is how I create the trackbars:</p>  <pre><code>capFrameFind = cv2.VideoCapture(videoFile) length = int(capFrameFind.get(7)/capFrameFind.get(5)) FFwinName = 'Video ' + str(videoNum) cv2.namedWindow(FFwinName) cv2.createTrackbar('start time(s)', FFwinName, 0, length, onChange) cv2.createTrackbar('end time(s)', FFwinName, length, length, onChange) </code></pre>  <p>I use the trackbars to scroll through the frames of the video (really, it's scrolling through time) until I find a time interval that looks good to me.</p>  <p>For a 359 sec video the trackbars are currently displayed something like this:</p>  <p>start ...s): 0 ||---------------------------------------------------------------</p>  <p>end ti...s): 359 -------------------------------------------------------------||</p>  <p>instead of looking like this:</p>  <p>start time(s): 0 ||---------------------------------------------------------------</p>  <p>end time (s): 359 -------------------------------------------------------------||</p>  <p>I find that for videos of different lengths the trackbars will change their appearance, but the labels always stay the same. Also, changing the image size of the frames being displayed doesn't change how the trackbar labels are displayed. This is what I mean:</p>  <pre><code>err,img = capFrameFind.read() img = cv2.resize(img, (640,360)) cv2.imshow(FFwinName, img) </code></pre>  <p>Increasing the size of img so that the trackbar can cover a larger area doesn't allow any more of the trackbar label to be shown. </p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
