<p>I have created simple app that is warning me, from time to time, to do something. There is a sound that alarms me to do that particular thing and buttons to mark it as done, or to postpone action. It is running in a background normally. When time comes, I can hear a sound, but I cannot see and app in foreground to push buttons. How can I bring application in foreground programmatically instead of clickcin on icon at android desktop? I found many samples for java, but how to do it (if it is possible) in AS3?</p>
