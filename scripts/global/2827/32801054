<p>I'm trying to create a webpage that's background changes color. The general idea is that the entire webpage is a single page. The text'll be loaded via jQuery, and the background fades from color to color. So 'articles' may have a blue background, and 'contact' may have a red background. </p>  <p>The difficulty I'm having is figuring out how to have a CSS Animation that can load from a non specific starting point. i.e., go from 'green' to any of the other ones. </p>  <p>All of the CSS Animation examples I've come across have been 'from' and 'to,' but I was looking for something along the lines of onClick GoTo, with a list of keyframes. </p>  <p>Somebody asked from code examples. I can put together some psuedo code.</p>  <p>instead of </p>  <pre><code>onClick { from: stateA to: stateB } </code></pre>  <p>something like</p>  <pre><code>onClick { from: currentState to: stateB } </code></pre>  <p>Thank you!</p>
