<p>I'm working on a smart phone application that pulls information from a website and displays it on the phone. When there is a new image on the site a notification is sent to the phone and smart watch. What I want to know, is there a way of setting the notification background image to the new image using the URL. To make the application faster I don't want to go downloading the Image straight to storage on the phone. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>
