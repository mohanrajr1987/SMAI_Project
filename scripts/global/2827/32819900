<p>I'm developing an app that listens the beacons, I want while app is in  background and is near a beacon want the app opens. How can it be done? I can put the moment of opening in one of these two methods:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager     didRangeBeacons:(NSArray *)beacons inRegion:(CLBeaconRegion *)region {  //.......... </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <pre><code>-(void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager         didEnterRegion:(CLRegion *)region {      //.........  } </code></pre>
