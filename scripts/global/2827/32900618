<p>I've asked this before but I guess it wasn't clear enough or I added too much detail....</p>  <p>Simply put, I need to put in the coding of a mute/un-mute button into this background music script I have here. I'm using weebly as a free host domain atm and their html/css set up is a lil limited, but gets the job done. I've tried alot of the answers on this site for setting up a mute toggle button, but they don't seem to work or I'm not putting them in right.... some are even weird checkboxes(and still didn't mute/unmute the music). Weebly is a lil weird but here's my script for the music.</p>  <pre><code>        &lt;audio preload="auto" src="MYMP3.mp3" loop="true" autobuffer&gt; Unsupported in Firefox &lt;/audio&gt; </code></pre>  <p>That's just the music.. the loop script(which I did find here thankfully &lt;3) is this.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;  function setCookie(c_name,value,exdays) {     var exdate=new Date();     exdate.setDate(exdate.getDate() + exdays);     var c_value=escape(value) + ((exdays==null) ? "" : "; expires="+exdate.toUTCString());     document.cookie=c_name + "=" + c_value; }  function getCookie(c_name) {     var i,x,y,ARRcookies=document.cookie.split(";");     for (i=0;i&lt;ARRcookies.length;i++)     {       x=ARRcookies[i].substr(0,ARRcookies[i].indexOf("="));       y=ARRcookies[i].substr(ARRcookies[i].indexOf("=")+1);       x=x.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,"");       if (x==c_name)         {         return unescape(y);         }       } }  var song = document.getElementsByTagName('audio')[0]; var played = false; var tillPlayed = getCookie('timePlayed'); function update() {     if(!played){         if(tillPlayed){         song.currentTime = tillPlayed;         song.play();         played = true;         }         else {                 song.play();                 played = true;         }     }      else {     setCookie('timePlayed', song.currentTime);     } } setInterval(update,1000); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have the images for the speaker on/off to be put in still...  So my question is this. <strong>What code do I need and where do I put it, to add a simple mute icon you can click and toggle on/off?</strong> </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6442427/muting-a-html5-audio-element-using-a-custom-button">Muting a HTML5 audio element using a custom button</a></p>  <p>I tried this and I have the toggle on/off working now.. but now the question is, how can I turn the text that says "toggle sound" into just a button?</p>
