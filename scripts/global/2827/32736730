<p>Sorry for my bad English... My application downloads the MP3-files and writes them to musicLibrary. Downloading files performed through BackgroundDownloader. The problem is the following: downloading is completed without problems in the internal phone memory, but is not completed on the SD-card. File on the SD-card has a size of 0 bytes.  In the manifest, the application has permission to internetClientServer, musicLibrary and removableStorage.</p>  <pre><code>public async void HandleSelectDownload(string urlDownload, string fileNameSave)     {         try         {             // Thông số tải nhạc             var requestUri = new Uri(urlDownload, UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute);              downloadTo = await KnownFolders.MusicLibrary.CreateFileAsync(fileNameSave, CreationCollisionOption.GenerateUniqueName);             BackgroundDownloader downloader = new BackgroundDownloader();             DownloadOperation operation = downloader.CreateDownload(requestUri, downloadTo);              //progressbar             Progress&lt;DownloadOperation&gt; downloadProgress = new Progress&lt;DownloadOperation&gt;(DownloadProgress);             // start download             await operation.StartAsync().AsTask(downloadProgress);             }          }         catch (Exception ex) { Debug.WriteLine("HandleSelectDownload Error : \n" + ex); }     }      public void DownloadProgress(DownloadOperation operation)     {         try         {             if (operation.Progress.TotalBytesToReceive == 0) return;              int progress = (int)(100 * ((double)operation.Progress.BytesReceived / (double)operation.Progress.TotalBytesToReceive));              Debug.WriteLine(String.Format("{0} of {1} kb. downloaded - %{2} complete.", operation.Progress.BytesReceived / 1024, operation.Progress.TotalBytesToReceive / 1024, progress));              if (progress &gt;= 100)             {                 Debug.WriteLine("Finish!: {0} ", operation.ResultFile.Name);             }         }         catch (Exception ex) { Debug.WriteLine("DownloadProgress Error :" + ex); }     } </code></pre>
