<p>I've written an iOS application which connects to a BLE device and exchanges  data in background. I carefully followed <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/CoreBluetoothBackgroundProcessingForIOSApps/PerformingTasksWhileYourAppIsInTheBackground.html" rel="nofollow">apple documentation</a> and set the background mode support with BLE accessories. Everything works as it should work except for one very specific scenario:</p>  <ol> <li>I start my application while my BLE device is off</li> <li>Start scanning for that specific BLE service</li> <li>Launch other apps on the phone i.e. games, youtube videos etc. to be sure that my app's resources are deallocated</li> <li>Open an app that has navigation (e.g. Apple Maps or Google maps)</li> <li>Start a navigation to any destination</li> <li>Turn on BLE device</li> </ol>  <p>I will never connect to that BLE device unless I lock-unlock the screen or bring my app to the foreground. That problem repeatedly happens in iOS7 and iOS8 for iPhone5, 5S and 6. In all other cases it works as expected. </p>  <p>Does anyone has experienced similar problem?</p>
