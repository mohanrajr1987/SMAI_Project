<p>I am implementing an App with continuous background updates on iOS 9. Even with allowsBackgroundUpdates set to YES, AlwaysUsage Description and with proper authorisation i am not getting location updates continuously. I am using Standard Location Services and Significant Location Services but not receiving any location updates when App is in Background. (App is in background/suspended but not terminated). Can anyone let me know if i have missed anything? Thanks in advance.</p>
