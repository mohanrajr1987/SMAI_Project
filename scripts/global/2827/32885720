<p>I was trying to open a URL session for a chunked response, I am able to achieve this by setting backgroundSessionConfigurationWithIdentifier in NSURLSessionConfiguration object. The URL session still runs if app goes to background, but the session terminates once I quit the app by swapping out from multitask view. Is there a way to restrict quitting the app till didFinishDownloadingToURL delegate called.</p>  <p>I have achieved the similar functionality in my android app using a native thread (boost thread reside in a .so called by UI thru JNI) which does not terminate if the UI is swapped out from the multi task view. Is there a way to achieve same in IOS app?</p>  <p>regards, Birajendu</p>
