<p>I  am using Alamofire for all my network purposes. I wish to add upload/download file operations that can run in the background. Apart from doing upload/download I should be able to query the process and be able to get progress information. This way I can either update Today's notification widget or update user, when the application is foregrounded.</p>  <p>Any suggestion/advice is most welcome. Size of the file I deal with may vary from 10KB to 2 GB.</p>  <p>I am using SWIFT for developing this application</p>
