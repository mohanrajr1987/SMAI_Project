<p>Hi I'm adding a background image through jQuery, but in chrome, when I do <code>.css("background", "url(foo/bar.jpg)")</code> it adds the full path like <code>http://localhost/project/foo/bar.jpg</code>. Anyone knows about this issue?</p>  <p>Here's the actual code I'm using:</p>  <pre><code>$("#"+id, opener.window.document).css("background", "url(&lt;?=$folder?&gt;/"+arquivo+")"+bgattr); </code></pre>  <p>It's a popup that changes the opener background.</p>  <p>In Firefox it adds just the relative path, as it was supposed to. Just tested on Chrome and Firefox.</p>
