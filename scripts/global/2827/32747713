<p>I have a pretty standard bootstrap layout with a fixed size container going down the page.  I'm wondering, however, if there is some way of decorating the areas to the left and right of the container in order to make it look less bland, such as with background images/colors/css styling etc.  I know the point of the container is to allow for responsive design, but is there a way that I can do this customization or does it go against the point of having the container in the first place?</p>
