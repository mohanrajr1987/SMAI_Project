<p>I load video with URL, like this: </p>  <pre><code>_videoURL = @"http://example.com/examplevideo.mp4"; self.playerView = [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:videoURL];             [self.playerView.view setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100)];             [self.playerView.moviePlayer prepareToPlay];             [self.view addSubview:self.playerView.view]; </code></pre>  <p>And everything is great: I could play/stop/pause/scroll video.  But then I hide my app, and after restoring app I receive a black screen of MPMoviePlayer(without the possibility of play/stop/scroll).</p>  <p>How can I resume playing video since the last time after background?</p>
