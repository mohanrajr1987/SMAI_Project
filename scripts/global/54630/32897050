<p>I'm trying to make several buttons using this script I found. Since I want several buttons with output in different cells I tried adding a variable, which I could set when adding the function to a drawing. This however doesn't seem to work and I have no idea how to do it.  So, the button works if I set a cell like "B2" in var activeRange = ss.getRange(DesiredCell); but when I try to use the variables I get "Script function incrementCellValuesByOne() could not be found"</p>  <p>The script I'm using</p>  <pre><code>function incrementCellValuesByOne(DesiredCell) {   // Increments the values in all the cells in the active range (i.e., selected cells).   // Numbers increase by one, text strings get a "1" appended.   // Cells that contain a formula are ignored.    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var activeRange = ss.getRange(DesiredCell);   var cell, cellValue, cellFormula;    // iterate through all cells in the active range   for (var cellRow = 1; cellRow &lt;= activeRange.getHeight(); cellRow++) {     for (var cellColumn = 1; cellColumn &lt;= activeRange.getWidth(); cellColumn++) {       cell = activeRange.getCell(cellRow, cellColumn);       cellFormula = cell.getFormula();        // if not a formula, increment numbers by one, or add "1" to text strings       // if the leftmost character is "=", it contains a formula and is ignored       // otherwise, the cell contains a constant and is safe to increment       // does not work correctly with cells that start with '=       if (cellFormula[0] != "=") {         cellValue = cell.getValue();         cell.setValue(cellValue + 1);       }     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>Am I doing this completely wrong? </p>
