<p>First: I am not GAS savvy.  About 3 years ago, I got some help to make one of my Sites pages retrieve the contents of one of my Drive folders. It basically did this each and every night at about midnight.  Back in April of this year, specifically Apr 23, 2015, the script stopped working.  I assume that the script I was using was calling a service that had been discontinued (Google Docs vs Google Drive, maybe?). It's 6 months later, and I'm just now getting around to attempting to find out what is happening, and hopefully someone can help me get back up and running. </p>  <p>Issue: I have no idea where this script is located, nor how I can open it up to look at it, nor what I would do with it once I did open it up.  It was greek to me then, I'm sure it would be greek to me now. </p>  <p>Since Apr 23, I've been getting the following email every single night. </p>  <pre><code>From: apps-scripts-notifications@google.com Your script, Get FSER Archives, has recently failed to finish successfully.

The desired result is as follows: Every month, I publish a newsletter for my group.  It is in .pdf format.  Every issue is saved to a specific Google Drive folder.  The "current month" is available on my Sites main home page.  I have a link to an "Archives" page.  This archives page lists every monthly issue going back nearly three years. If you click on the issue title, it opens up the pdf file. I would like to re-automate the process of populating this Archives page with the contents of my Drive folder.  i.e. "list all of my archived newsletters".</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
