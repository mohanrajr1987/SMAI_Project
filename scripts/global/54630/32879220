<p>I am trying to detect background color change of two cells. A while back I created the following Google Sheet function and added it as an installable trigger From spreadsheet On change since cell color changes are not detected by on Edit. I thought it worked but I just checked it now, and it is not detecting which cell's background color was changed, Any ideas?</p>  <pre><code>function onChangeInstallable(e) {    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var activeSheet = ss.getActiveSheet();   var activeSheetName = activeSheet.getSheetName();    if (activeSheetName == "Settings") {      if(e.changeType == "OTHER"){        // makes it this far ok but following line returns       // #REF! instead of A1 notation of changed cell.        var editedRange = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveRange().getA1Notation();        if (editedRange == 'B43' || editedRange == 'B44'){          setBackgroundColors();        }     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>Also tried the following, but it returns a "Cell reference out of range" error.</p>  <pre><code>var editedRange = activeSheet.getActiveCell().getA1Notation(); </code></pre>
