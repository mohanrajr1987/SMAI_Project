<p>I have a web-service that I've written.  I'd like that web-service to be consumed from Google Apps Script, or really anywhere, but using a user's Google sign-in (account name/e-mail) to identify them.  </p>  <p>OAuth doesn't really solve this problem (to my knowledge), as it's more about getting access to a user's resources.  In addition, as a web-service, I can't call out to a user's permission page.  SAML has a similar problem.</p>  <p>What I'm looking for, ideally, is a digitally signed document by Google that the person is who they say they are, and that I can verify with a public key that Google provides.  </p>  <p>Does anyone know if Google provides that, and if not, whether there's an alternative means of solving my problem?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
