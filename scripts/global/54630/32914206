<p>I have a google sheet where I've created a form (survey) using scripting. In that sheet, I've assigned x number of users a unique user id (e.g. DR8371 or JH3059) to help keep track of who's taken the survey and what their answers are (this is not meant to be anonymous). However, I can't figure out how to attach the user id from the sheet to the form (the sheet contains the form responses though). The first question on the form asks what the user's ID is, and I don't want the form to submit the responses unless the user ID is correct. Is there a way do this? The user ID's need to stay on the sheet where I currently have them stored.</p>
