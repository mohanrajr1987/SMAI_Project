<p>I'm new to Google Script and decided to try out the documentation code here located at the bottom. The code is located below:</p>  <pre><code>function createAndSendDocument() {    // Create a new Google Doc named 'Hello, world!'    var doc = DocumentApp.create('Hello, world!');     // Access the body of the document, then add a paragraph.    doc.getBody().appendParagraph('This document was created by Google Apps Script.');     // Get the URL of the document.    var url = doc.getUrl();     // Get the email address of the active user - that's you.    var email = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();     // Get the name of the document to use as an email subject line.    var subject = doc.getName();     // Append a new string to the "url" variable to use as an email body.    var body = 'Link to your doc: ' + url;     // Send yourself an email with a link to the document.    GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body); } </code></pre>  <p>The code works just fine, but since I did not want it to create a new document every time I run this, I edited the code to:</p>  <pre><code>function sendDocument() {    // Get the name of the document to use as an email subject line.    var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();     // Get the email address of the active user - that's you.    var email = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();     // Append a new string to use as an email body.    var body = 'Link to your doc: ' + doc.getUrl() + '. Happy editing! :D';     // Send yourself an email with a link to the document.    GmailApp.sendEmail(email, doc, body); } </code></pre>  <p>However, I could not run the above code and an error message popped up saying:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: Cannot call method "getUrl" of null. (line 9, file "") </code></pre>  <p>Here's my execution transcript:</p>  <pre><code>[15-10-03 10:13:26:875 PDT] Starting execution [15-10-03 10:13:26:881 PDT] DocumentApp.getActiveDocument() [0 seconds] [15-10-03 10:13:26:883 PDT] Session.getActiveUser() [0 seconds] [15-10-03 10:13:26:883 PDT] User.getEmail() [0 seconds] [15-10-03 10:13:26:886 PDT] Execution failed: TypeError: Cannot call method "getUrl" of null.
