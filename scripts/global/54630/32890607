<p>I have to organize a Google Form vote for different jobs in my class. There are 1 place available for each job but the same person can ask for different jobs. </p>  <p>So i need to create a form where if a person is selected in one of the multiple choice question, it can appears in another question but can't be selected. </p>  <p><strong>Example :</strong> </p>  <p><em>Q1 : Who would you like to be at the door ?</em></p>  <ul> <li>Person 1 <em>=> Selected</em></li> <li>Person 2 <em>!!! Gray and unselectable</em></li> <li>Person 3 <em>XXX Not Selected</em></li> </ul>  <p><em>Q2 : Who would you like to be at the office ?</em></p>  <ul> <li>Person 1 <em>!!! Gray and unselectable</em></li> <li>Person 2 <em>=> Selected</em></li> <li>Person 3 <em>XXX Not Selected</em></li> </ul>  <p><em>Q3 : Who would like to be at the window ?</em></p>  <ul> <li>Person 2 *!!! <em>Gray and unselectable</em></li> <li>Person 4 <em>XXX Not Selected</em></li> </ul>  <p>Do you have any ideas how i could do it ?</p>
