<p>I was trying to run the sample script of Google Apps Script here:  <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/apps-script-oauth2/blob/master/samples/GoogleServiceAccount.gs" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/googlesamples/apps-script-oauth2/blob/master/samples/GoogleServiceAccount.gs</a></p>  <p>I believe I set PRIVATE_KEY, CLIENT_EMAIL and USER_EMAIL correctly from JSON file downloaded from Google Developer Console. Also I enabled Google Drive API on the project. But still I get an error in the dialog "Error: invalid_client\n no application name".</p>  <p>Is there any code I should add / change to run this sample script correctly? </p>
