<p>I'm working on a script which consist in get members from a group,  the script identifies if the mail whether is a group email or a member email, but, in my job, we have groups in groups !</p>  <p>So here's the script</p>  <pre><code>function getGroupUsers() { var group = sheet.getActiveRange().getValue(); var members = AdminDirectory.Members.list(group).members; for (var i = 1; i &lt; members.length; i++) {   var member = members[i];   var caseUser = sheet.getRange(i+1, 1);   var caseGroupe = sheet.getRange(i+1, 2);       var lastRange = sheet.getRange(sheet.getLastRow(), 3); //  var caseGroupe2 = sheet.getRange(i+1, 4);  switch (member.type) {     case 'USER':       Logger.log('%s is a user', member.email);       caseUser.setValue(member.email);       break;     case 'GROUP':       Logger.log('%s is a group', member.email);       //var group = GroupsApp.getGroupByEmail(member.email);       caseGroupe.setValue(member.email);       break;     default:       Logger.log('nothing');   } </code></pre>  <p>That's workin, as groups going in the second column, but i need them to be auto extended , like what I'm doing with the loop in the begining, but I'm not sure how can it works, I tried loops in loops but when I get members of the group there's only one written in the case instead of all.</p>  <p>If you need more information, or you need me to explain a point you're not sure to understand just tell me</p>
