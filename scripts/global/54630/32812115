<p>I have a Google Form that feeds responses to a spreadsheet with a few custom formulas (filters, SQL queries, other sheets etc).</p>  <p><strong>My users request a copy of this Form (the template) and I would like to automate the process of making a copy of the Google Form and the linked spreadsheet while keeping the custom functionality in that spreadsheet.</strong> </p>  <p>Copying the Form is not a problem but then the user has to create a new spreadsheet for the responses to go to (without the custom functionality).</p>  <p>It looks like making a copy of the sheet manually (in Drive) automatically creates a linked Google Form. But can I do that with scripts? And, if so, how do I get the ID of the newly created Google Form that goes with the newly duplicated spreadsheet?</p>  <p>Any advice is much appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you,</p>  <p>Pierre</p>
