<p>I have a Google Apps Script running that sends me an email if I have more than 20 unread emails. It uses simple HTML tags to format a table with a listing of the details of each email. It also has a link to each unread email to allow me to open it (mail.google.com/mail).</p>  <p>It worked fine until today (why just today?) when I made a very simple change to it (the order of 2 fields in the table). Now I am receiving a phishing notification on the received emails ("<em>Be careful with this message. It contains content that's typically used to steal personal information</em>") with the option to "<em>Report this suspicious message</em>" or "<em>Ignore, I trust this message</em>". If I select "<em>Ignore</em>", it unflags that particular msg and shows the links, however, the next email still gets flagged as a possible phishing email.</p>  <p>It appears that it is the links to the unread emails that cause this (although this has always been in the script). Surely this doesn't mean that Google Mail doesn't trust its own site mail.google.com? Should I report them to themselves as being suspicious? :) </p>  <p>What can I do to permanently remove the phishing notification?</p>
