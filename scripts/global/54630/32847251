<p>Good day I have one spreadsheet that share with 3 users. Each user has its own tab/sheet with its own permission.  ie : sheet1 (user1), sheet2(user2), sheet3 (user3) At the end of the day I have them execute a simple macro which copies values to the top of the sheet It’s been working fine for last 4 years. All of the sudden, I get user2 and user3 unable to execute the macro. They get something like “you trying to modify a cell or protected object…..” and all is trying to do is:</p>  <pre><code>var  a = ss.setActiveSelection("Q139").getValue(); var b = ss.setActiveSelection("R140").getValue();  var c = ss.setActiveSelection("Q141").getValue(); var  d = ss.setActiveSelection("Q142").getValue(); var e = ss.setActiveSelection("R143").getValue(); </code></pre>  <p>Like I said, first user (sheet1) executes with no problem. Just the other two are not able.  I’ve tried to set the values on others cells and it does the same. </p>  <p>Any ideas why this is happening now?</p>
