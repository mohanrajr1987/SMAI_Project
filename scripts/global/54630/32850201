<p>I am trying to get data from a JSON file and use Javascript Code to put it into Google Spreadsheet, I did good with some part of the data but I'm stuck with the other part, where I want to match the User Id and put all the data with it on a same row, </p>  <p>JSON Data:</p>  <pre><code>"m":{"414":{"a":{"0":{"c":38,"p":12812.4},  "4":{"c":35,"p":10559.94},"2":{"c":43,"p":35811.63}, "6":{"c":48,"p":45530}},"d":{"0":{"c":55,"p":5477.06225}, "4":{"c":694,"p":106649.473},"2":{"c":1844,"p":716733.50775000011}, "6":{"c":605,"p":324152.5875}},"i":{"0":{"c":0,"p":0}, "4":{"c":0,"p":0},"2":{"c":0,"p":0},"6":{"c":542,"p":19893.93}}}, "404":{"a":{"0":{"c":15,"p":916.182},"4":{"c":50,"p":12357}, "2":{"c":530,"p":390825.27},"6":{"c":58,"p":4841.55}}, "d":{"0":{"c":10,"p":3145.8},"4":{"c":770,"p":141876.12}, "2":{"c":4854,"p":2173966.6125000003}, "6":{"c":1973,"p":1145077.425}},"i":{"0":{"c":0,"p":0}, "4":{"c":0,"p":0},"2":{"c":0,"p":0},"6":{"c":594,"p":25444.41}}}}, </code></pre>  <p>Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>var testUF = []; var Uid = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(doc1.m);   for (var lp2 = 0; lp2 &lt; Uid.length; lp2++) {     var Ua1 = doc1.m[lp2].a["0"].p;     var Ua2 = doc1.m[lp2].a["4"].p;     var Ua3 = doc1.m[lp2].a["2"].p;     var Ua4 = doc1.m[lp2].a["6"].p;     var Ud1 = doc1.m[lp2].d["0"].p;     var Ud2 = doc1.m[lp2].d["4"].p;     var Ud3 = doc1.m[lp2].d["2"].p;     var Ud4 = doc1.m[lp2].d["6"].p;     var Ui4 = doc1.m[lp2].i["6"].p;    testUF.push([Uid,Ua1,Ua2,Ua3,Ua4,Ud1,Ud2,Ud3,Ud4,Ui4]);} </code></pre>  <p>I am getting the Array on the Uid while Debugging, but all the other Variables don't get the data it stays Undefined. I want all the other variables to match with the Uid's and stay in the same row. I did the JSON parsing and everything.</p>  <p>I am asking for the first time on stackoverflow, please forgive me if I couldn't state everything properly. Thank you for the help. :)</p>
