<p>I'm looking at incorporating the new <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/rest/" rel="nofollow">Google Apps Script Execution API</a> into an existing C# plugin i have already working. I am following the <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/rest/quickstart/dotnet" rel="nofollow">.NET quickstart guide</a> provided as a console application (which i have gotten working without problem).</p>  <p>When porting the code from that into my plugin it will also fail at runtime at the first instance of:</p>  <pre><code>UserCredential credential; </code></pre>  <p>which I slimmed down the code so far to just that line which fails giving:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Could not load file or assembly 'Google.Apis.Auth, Version=1.9.2.27817, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=4b01fa6e34db77ab' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified."</p> </blockquote>  <p>The file is properly referenced (having installed via nuget).</p>  <p>C# is not my normal field and perhaps i'm missing something in the subtlety of it working in a Console App.</p>  <p>What gives?</p>
