<p>I created a script in the script editor, published it as a "Deploy as API executable". Inside this script, I provided a doc_id to my sheet and defined a function to get data from that sheet.</p>  <p>I then went to <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/execution/rest/v1/scripts/run" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/apps-script/execution/rest/v1/scripts/run</a> to test the execution API. I added the scopes, authorized the app and tried it. I am getting the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>"error": {   "code": 403,   "message": "The caller does not have permission",   "status": "PERMISSION_DENIED" } </code></pre>  <p>Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
