<p>I'm using the following to setup a biweekly trigger in my spreadsheet script. </p>  <pre><code>function createBiWeeklyTrigger() {   // Trigger every other Monday at 09:00.   ScriptApp.newTrigger('send_biweekly_feedback_solicitation')       .timeBased()       .everyWeeks(2)       .onWeekDay(ScriptApp.WeekDay.MONDAY)       .atHour(6)       .create(); } </code></pre>  <p>However, when I look at the current project triggers, this trigger doesn't look any different from a weekly trigger (see screenshot below).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9JLtj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9JLtj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>How can I tell if this trigger has in fact been setup correctly -- to run every TWO weeks?</p>
