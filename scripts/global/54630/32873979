<p>Script Editor:  Can I write a script that sends the submitter and myself the completed form questions voiding the unanswered questions?   I have created an order form and I am trying to send the submitter and myself the order confirmation data.  Not just an email that says thank you for your submission, but one that can contain the data of ONLY the entered data fields.   </p>
