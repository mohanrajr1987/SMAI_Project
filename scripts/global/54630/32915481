<p>I have a folder which may or may not contain forms and connected response spreadsheets.  However, the code below returns false even when these files are present.</p>  <pre><code>  //checks the number of Google Forms in the subdomain folder   var files = myFolder.getFilesByType('GOOGLE_SHEETS');   Logger.log(files.hasNext()); </code></pre>  <p>This code returns true:</p>  <pre><code>  var files = myFolder.getFiles();   Logger.log(files.hasNext()); </code></pre>  <p>I'm imagining that I'm somehow getting the MimeType wrong, but as far as I can see <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/mime-type" rel="nofollow">in Google's documentation</a> this is correct.  I'd really rather check specifically for these file types instead of just checking for files.</p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p>
