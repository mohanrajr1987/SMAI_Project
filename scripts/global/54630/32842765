<p>We have a few Google Sheets that pull data from our on-premise databases using a public IP address and JDBC connection. They worked just fine, until about 2 weeks ago, when we started getting messages that the connection failed. Attached screenshot shows the connection details (IP, username and password obfuscated for obvious reasons). Nothing was changed on our network or in the scripts, and we have confirmed that we can connect through means other than Google Apps Script using the same configuration. Does anyone have any idea what's going on here?ï»¿</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jk1wL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jk1wL.png" alt="JDBC_Connection"></a></p>
