<p>I implemented the code from Alexander Ivanov in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10553846/get-link-url-to-an-calendar-event-in-google-apps-script">Get link (url) to an calendar event in google apps script</a> and it worked perfectly. Suddenly, it does not. No explanation, no logs, no error messages, nothing. I am using a corporate account and I have created a changelog and scheduled maintenance calendar to have events added based on form submissions and email the user the link to the calendar event.</p>  <p>Even though the settings are the same for both calendars, it seems that this works on one but not the other (was working fine for both just last week).</p>  <p>Anyone have any ideas? Any other methods of accomplishing this? I've had to disable this highly requested feature of my form as a result :(</p>
