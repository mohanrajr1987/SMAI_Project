<p>I am working on the following thing:</p>  <ol> <li>User saves his car parked location</li> <li>Later, user clicks on "find my car". It should display the distance, and navigate the user to his exact car location.</li> </ol>  <p>I'm doing the following:</p>  <ol> <li>When the user click on "save my car location", the app takes user's current location co-ordinates.</li> <li>When the user clicks on "find my car", app will take user's current co-ordinate and previously saved car co-ordinates.</li> <li>Then, I'm sending these two points to this URL : <a href="http://%@/maps?sourceaddress=%f,%f&amp;destinationaddress=%f,%f" rel="nofollow">http://%@/maps?sourceaddress=%f,%f&amp;destinationaddress=%f,%f</a>",@"maps.google.com  and showing result in web-view.</li> </ol>  <p>The problem is that this is not showing the exact location. Suppose the user parks his car at a specific parking slot at MALL-A, and he clicks "find my car" from MALL-B. The app is only showing directions from MALL-B to MALL-A in general, whereas it should display directions from MALL-B to MALL-A's exact parking spot where the user parked his car.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how I can get the exact location co-ordinates and navigation between two points?</p>
