<p>I have a pin that the user can add on my user location via a long press , it also ads a pin on the point the user pressed on (witch makes two pins on the map but I will eventually delete the one where the user pressed from my code) the annotation witch is on the point the user pressed shows the address of the pin witch is what I also want for the user location however it displays "map" (I thought that adding "annotation.title = title;" to my code would solve it but it doesn't , how could I make this work? my full code is below, thanks !</p>  <pre><code>func action(gestureRecognizer:UIGestureRecognizer) {          if gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerState.Began {              var touchPoint = gestureRecognizer.locationInView(self.Map)              var newCoordinate = self.Map.convertPoint(touchPoint, toCoordinateFromView: self.Map)              var location = CLLocation(latitude: newCoordinate.latitude , longitude: newCoordinate.longitude)              //new code for user location, start ( modify to have it populated )                let annotation = MKPointAnnotation();             annotation.title = title;             annotation.coordinate = self.Map.userLocation.location.coordinate;             self.Map.addAnnotation(annotation);               func mapView(mapView: MKMapView!,                 viewForAnnotation annotation: MKAnnotation!) -&gt; MKAnnotationView!{                     if(annotation is MKUserLocation){                         return nil;                     }                     let pinView: Void = mapView.addAnnotation(annotation);                     let pinAnnotationView = MKPinAnnotationView(annotation: annotation,reuseIdentifier:"MyIdentifier");                     return pinAnnotationView;                      //new code for user location, stop              }               CLGeocoder().reverseGeocodeLocation(location, completionHandler: { (placemarks, error) -&gt; Void in                  var title = ""                  if (error == nil) {                        if let p = CLPlacemark(placemark: placemarks?[0] as!
