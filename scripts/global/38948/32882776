<p>My application has a Scrollview, which remains hidden until the MapView is done rendering. However you can still go back to the home screen before MapView is done rendering.</p>  <p>My issue is that whenever I try to do this while the MapView is loading/rendering the segue doesn't work, and when it does the animation is buggy. </p>  <p>Therefore, I would like to know if there is anyway to interrupt the MapView loading/rendering?</p>
