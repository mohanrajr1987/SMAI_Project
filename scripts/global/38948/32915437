<p>So when I was using Swift 1.2, this function worked fine and gave me the functionality I needed.</p>  <pre><code>func mapView(mapView: MKMapView, rendererForOverlay overlay: MKOverlay) -&gt; MKOverlayRenderer {      if overlay is MKPolyline {         let pr = MKPolylineRenderer(overlay: overlay)         pr.strokeColor = self.lightBlue         pr.lineWidth = 14         return pr     } //I get the error here, because I need to return something     } </code></pre>  <p>Now, I get an error saying "Missing return in a function expected to return 'MKOverlayRenderer'".</p>  <p>Is this still how this method is used? What can I do to remedy this?</p>
