<p>In iOS 9 map annotation is showing up as black pin for current location and other as red pin. My custom assets are missing and also on tap my custom callout view is not showing up. I am not sure what happening. Same code is running in iOS 8 and everything work as expected. Any idea?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cirXI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cirXI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
