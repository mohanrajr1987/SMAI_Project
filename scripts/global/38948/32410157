<p>I am developing an app with a map view. The map view should have annotations, but the pin should always be centred and the map should scroll under it. For that, instead of adding annotation to map, I added a <code>UIView</code>(with a pin image as background) as subview to my view controller's view. Now the map view and the <code>UIView</code> are in the same hierarchy. The <code>UIView</code> is centred and the map will scroll under it. (Is there a better solution?)</p>  <p>Now the problem I am facing with is the callout accessory. I have the tap event on the <code>UIView</code>, where I can create a another <code>UIView</code> as callout accessory. But what would be the best option to create a callout accessory in my case. Any ideas are welcome.</p>
