<p>I'm having some trouble with my code. I have an MKMapView, and I set</p>  <pre><code>showsUserLocation = true </code></pre>  <p>Now, I also added an MKAnnotation, but when I do:</p>  <pre><code>mapView.showAnnotations([myPin]) </code></pre>  <p>the map moves to the pin (naturally). What I would like is the map to zoom out enough so that both my annotation and my blue dot be visible. I tried obtaining mapView.userLocation, but it returns nil, so I don't know how else I could set a region. I'm trying to avoid having to create a CLLocationManager object within my class, cause it's a little overkill.</p>  <p>Anyways to achieve that?</p>
