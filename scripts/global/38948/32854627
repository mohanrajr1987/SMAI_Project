<p>I am drawing a circle on a map with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)createBoundaryWithRadius:(float)radius andCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coord {     MKCircle *circle = [MKCircle circleWithCenterCoordinate:coord radius:radius];     [self.mapView removeOverlays:self.mapView.overlays];     [self.mapView addOverlay:circle]; } </code></pre>  <p>This works fine, however, on the new "Flyover" map, half the circle's boundary is thick while the other half is about 1/2 as thick.  This issue does not occur with any other map type.  How can I get a uniform circle boundary width?</p>
