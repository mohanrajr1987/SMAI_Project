<p>Whenever the user moves my MKMapView, I load more pins on to the map. Right now, I am using this code to detect when they drag it:</p>  <pre><code>- (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)otherGestureRecognizer {     return YES; }  - (void)didDragMap:(UIGestureRecognizer*)gestureRecognizer {     if (gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded){         CLLocationCoordinate2D topLeft, bottomRight;         topLeft = [self.mapView convertPoint:CGPointMake(0, 0) toCoordinateFromView:self.mapView];         CGPoint pointBottomRight = CGPointMake(self.mapView.frame.size.width, self.mapView.frame.size.height);         bottomRight = [self.mapView convertPoint:pointBottomRight toCoordinateFromView:self.mapView];          [self loadMorePlaces:topLeft bottomRight:bottomRight];     } } </code></pre>  <p>However, this only detects when a user stopped dragging. A user can "fling" the map and the map can still be moving AFTER they finish "dragging". Is there a way I can find when the map stops moving? Thanks</p>
