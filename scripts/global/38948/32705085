<p>I have a MapViewController class and I set the</p>  <pre><code>mapView.delegate = self </code></pre>  <p>in viewDidLoad. When I first load the map, annotations are rendered correctly. However, after a refresh (e.g., after I hit a button in callout - say 'delete'), all the other pins lose their images and are rendered 'red'.</p>  <p>In my refresh method, I remove all annotations:</p>  <pre><code>mapView.removeAnnotations(mapView.annotations) </code></pre>  <p>and then recreate the annotations in the same manner I created them on initial load.</p>  <p>This code was working fine until today, when I upgraded to Swift 2.0. Was I simply lucky until now or am I missing a new piece of code?</p>  <p>I even tried forcing the pin to default to Green. But no matter what I do (set an image or change colour), post refresh, all pins are red :(</p>
