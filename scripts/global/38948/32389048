<p>I'm adding a bunch of MKPointAnnotations to my map using this code:</p>  <pre><code>MKPointAnnotation *point = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init]; point.coordinate = myCoord; point.title = [place valueForKey:@"PlaceTitle"]; [self.mapView addAnnotation:point]; </code></pre>  <p>What I want to do is make the Pin's title clickable and open a "Detail" page for that Pin. So, I want to open a new ViewController with the place's ID.</p>  <p>My question is: how can I set a unique ID for the MKAnnotationPoint as well as how can I trigger an event when the Pin's title is clicked? <strong>Note</strong>: I am displaying the user's current location and I do <em>not</em> want that to be clickable.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
