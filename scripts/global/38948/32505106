<p>I created a custom view and I have a map in it, this is how my view is setup.</p>  <pre><code>- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame withPackage:(AftershipTracking *)package andLocation:(CLLocation *)location {     if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) {         self = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"SPShareView" owner:nil options:nil] lastObject];         [self setLabelsWithPackage:package];         _dayLabel.text = _dayLabel.text.uppercaseString;         [self setupMapWithPinLocation:location];      }      return self; } </code></pre>  <p>Inside of the <code>setupMapWithPinLocation</code> I have this.</p>  <pre><code>- (void)setupMapWithPinLocation:(CLLocation *)location {     _mapView = [[MKMapView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 760, 560)];     _mapView.mapType = MKMapTypeStandard;     _mapView.delegate = self;     MKPointAnnotation *annotation = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];     [annotation setCoordinate:location.coordinate];     [_mapView addAnnotation:annotation];      MKCoordinateRegion region = [_mapView regionThatFits:MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance(location.coordinate , 700, 700)];     region.span.latitudeDelta = 3;     region.span.longitudeDelta = 3;     [_mapView setRegion:region animated:NO];  } </code></pre>  <p>However after creating the view, when I look at it in debug I get a blank map that has not been loaded yet, what would be the correct way to go about implementing this? I added the delegate methods for checking if the <code>MapView</code> loaded and they seem to never get called. Also I do not need the map to be interactive, the map can be turned into an image and that would be good.</p>
