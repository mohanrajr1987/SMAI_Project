<p>I have an SWRevealController that has a front view composed of a Navigation controller that contains a container view controller with children: table view controller and map view controller. </p>  <p>Problem: when my map view is the visible child on my front view, I tap the menu button to reveal my menu. When the menu is visible, attempting to do a pan gesture to push the menu back out of view causes the map to pan, but no SW reveal behavior occurs. However, I can tap the menu button to hide menu.</p>  <p>I tried disabling the front views gestures when the menu is visible. This works in allowing me to swipe away the menu, but disables my menu button since it's part of the front view. I would like both to work.</p>  <p>I have an idea: I could make my nav controller overlay it's contents with a clear UIView to block anything underneath from moving (does this work?). But how do I inform my Navigation controller that the menu is visible?</p>  <p>I tried changing the class type of the SWRevealControllers FrontView to a custom class, but it wouldn't let me...not sure why.I'll post the error in a bit. I am also considering issuing a notification when the menu is active to inform my views to disable gestures? Not sure what the best approach is here.</p>  <p>If anyone has any other suggestions, I am open to them!</p>
