<p>I would like to keep the mapView on the users currentLocation, but I would like to hide the currentLocation annotation. When I put</p>  <pre><code> mapView.showsUserLocation = NO; </code></pre>  <p>in my code, I am unable to use:</p>  <pre><code>MKCoordinateRegion region = MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance (userCurrentLocation.location.coordinate, 10000, 10000);     [mapView setRegion:region animated:YES]; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a solution? I may be able to use the following library to set the color to [UIColor clearColor]</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/TransitApp/SVPulsingAnnotationView" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/TransitApp/SVPulsingAnnotationView</a> </p>
