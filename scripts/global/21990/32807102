<p>I just started learning Linux development and for the training purpose I wrote a simple loadable kernel module. When I try to add it by issuing the following command - make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD modules</p>  <p>I get the following error:</p>  <p>error: too many arguments to function ‘netlink_kernel_create’   nl_sk = netlink_kernel_create(&amp;init_net, NETLINK_EXAMPLE, 0, recv_msg, NULL, THIS_MODULE);</p>  <p>Could anyone help me solve this problem. Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance. </p>
