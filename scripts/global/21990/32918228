<p>I'm presently using a Linux command in my c program to show a group of processes. When a process is stopped (suspended) though, this command does not list it. I need to list both running AND stopped jobs. <strong>Note:</strong> When I say stopped, I do NOT mean terminated jobs. The issue is with displaying suspended processes.</p>  <pre><code>execvp("/bin/ps", parmList); </code></pre>  <p>I have to use the ps command. Is there anyway to show both running and stopped (suspended) processes in this situation?</p>
