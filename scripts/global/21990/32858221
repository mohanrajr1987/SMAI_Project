<p>Here's the situation: I am using a mac to compile Linux kernel for an arm board, some how this happened:</p>  <pre><code>arch/arm/vdso/vdsomunge.c:48:10: fatal error: 'byteswap.h' file not found </code></pre>  <p>I googled and find out that mac doesn't have a 'byteswap.h', so I download a 'byteswap.h' version based on 'OSByteOrder.h' write by others, but I don't know where to put that header.</p>  <p>Any one can help?</p>
