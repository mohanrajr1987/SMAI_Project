<p>I have to port a kernel module my coworker and I built in the 2.6.38 to the 2.6.18 kernel.  Everything was going well, until we hit this brick wall. One of the compile errors was:</p>  <pre><code>variable 'desc' does not have predefined size </code></pre>  <p>Doing some looking around I found that it was because it was not defined anywhere due to the fact that it did not exist in this version of the kernel.  The definition is for <code>struct hash_desc</code> which is missing in the Linux 2.6.18 src/include directory but is found in <code>linux/crypto.h</code> of the Linux 2.6.38 src/include directory.</p>  <p>I've searched the the 2.6.18 source as thoroughly as I could, using <code>grep -H -R "struct hash_desc" .</code> being a great help, and I've come to the conclusion that it is not there at least in this form.  Is it possible that it is under some different name or if not, possible to easily reconstruct this struct and it's functionality?</p>
