<p>The main use of cache is to speed up the system (since hard-disk I/O are slow). but i have a system which has <b>only RAM (no hard-disk or anything)</b> so in this case Page cache is become overhead in terms of CPU Cycle and memory(since 2 copy of same page exist in RAM(one in cache part and other in RAM part(since no hard disk))).  How can i <b>disable or remove(delete page cache functionality)</b> PAGE Cache ,just like we have option to disable Swap memory? </p>  <p>i am aware of <b>drop_caches</b> option for clearing caches. but calling drop_caches in some regular interval will end up eating more CPU cycle.</p>  <p>any suggestion will appreciated.  Thanks </p>
