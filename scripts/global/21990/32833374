<p>I have a working linux system that I want to roll a custom kernel.  As it is, everything works, I'm simply branching out into trying to optimize the system as best I can.</p>  <p>Most methods I have found to explore drivers on my system appear to list all drivers loaded (though  I may be wrong about that).  Is there some kind of tool that actually shows what drivers are needed?</p>  <p>Using lsmod gives me a basic idea though many of the modules shown don't seem to be used.  Also, I had thought that lsmod is only for the loadable modules and not the ones built into the kernel itself.</p>  <p>TL;DR:  What is the best way for me to find out what drivers I need to roll my own kernel from a working system?</p>
