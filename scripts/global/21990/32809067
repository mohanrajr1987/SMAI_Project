<p>I am trying to understand how the Android kernel update works.</p>  <p>At the site <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/" rel="nofollow">https://android.googlesource.com/</a> I could notice that there are many people working in the Android OS source code. I saw that patches that fix bugs and vulnerabilities are committed there as well.</p>  <p>I am working in an app that aims to diagnose a device based on its metadata, as Android version, kernel version, build number,  build timestamp (unix epoch timestamp), and so on.</p>  <p>There are a vulnerability that affects several Android versions, including the version running in my device (Jelly Bean 4.1.2), however, according to the "Trustable by Bluebox" app, my device is protected against this vulnerability. The patch that fixes this vulnerability was released in 2013  and the kernel build timestamp of my device was released in 2014. Maybe this explain the fact that my device is not susceptible to this vulnerability. But it is just a speculation, and I would like to make sure.</p>  <p>I would like to know if the updates released at the site mentioned above are automatically installed on my device, as the patch that fixes the vulnerability mentioned above. If this updates changes the build timestamp which can be obtained by the constant Build.TIME in Android SDK. And mainly, if I can guarantee that a device is protected against a vulnerability if the kernel build timestamp is bigger than vulnerability fix patch release date.</p>  <p>If anyone can explain me or point me a reference where I can get these information I would be really grateful.</p>
