<p>I've been working on kernel patches for the first time and I did 6 patches and added them to git. Now, whenever I commit all the files come up in the git commit message as follows: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yi3Ek.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yi3Ek.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now, I just want to send changes about one file at a time. I asked some people, they told I'd have to revert back the entire process and clone the staging repo again. Is there a way to remove the other files or at least revert back the changes to git?</p>  <p>I've used the following:</p>  <ul> <li>git rm --cached</li> <li>git reset</li> </ul>  <p>Please tell if there's a way to do so.</p>
