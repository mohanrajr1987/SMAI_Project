<p>I have a Linux kernel module which calculates network packet statistics among several CPUs (in kernel address space). Periodically I clear the corresponding memory chunk and strongly need this action to take immediate effect for all CPUs, otherwise it will distort the subsequent statistics values. My target CPU is a Power PC, so its cache coherency is very relaxed. Thus I need to manually flush data caches of all CPUs just after zeroing the memory.</p>  <p>So what should I place just after my clearing procedure:</p>  <pre><code>memset(ptr, 0, size); // what's going here? </code></pre>
