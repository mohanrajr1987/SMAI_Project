<p>I want to simulate an interrupt in a Linux module. If I have the following situation:</p>  <pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {      if (i == 5) {         // I want to have an interrupt here which         // tell to a process that it  arrives here     }  } </code></pre>  <p>when <code>i == 5</code>, I want to have an interrupt or something similar. Is it that possible?</p>  <p>BR.</p>
