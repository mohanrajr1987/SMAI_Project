<p>Is it possible to find out who (place in code) locked a <code>spinlock</code>? Some file with statistics or so?</p>  <p>More info about my issue: I have a place in code which is trying to obtain a <code>spinlock</code>. The cpu core which runs the kernel thread with <code>spin_lock_irqsave</code> is 100% loaded. I turned on lockup detection in kernel. However I don't get '<code>BUG: spinlock lockup</code>'. The only info which I get in syslog is 'spinlock waiting more than 120 secs' (I get this from the other threads which are trying to access the <code>spinlock</code>, not from the 100% loaded one). </p>  <p>Thanks Rene</p>
