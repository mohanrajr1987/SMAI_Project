<p>I have a requirement to write a linux device driver in userspace.</p>  <p>How can I write a library which, when linked to an application, can handle system calls to a particular device.</p>  <p>The application should be able to use <code>open()</code>, <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, <code>ioctl()</code> on a device such as <code>/dev/mydev0</code>, but these calls should terminate in a userspace library instead of a kernel module.</p>  <p>Please advise on if this is possible and how can I achieve this.</p>
