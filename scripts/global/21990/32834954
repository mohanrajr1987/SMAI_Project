<p>I checked my apache logs and it turns out that apache is using sysvsem for all its mutex operations. </p>  <p>because of this, I feel I can make some optimizations within linux.</p>  <p>I issued on the command-line:</p>  <pre><code>echo 500 64000 128 256 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/sem </code></pre>  <p>so that I can increase semaphore allocation in general all around since I have 81 apache processes running. I also increased "max ops per semop call" from 32 to 128 because I want the background operations running fast. (aka process 128 operations at a time instead of 32).</p>  <p>I then executed:</p>  <pre><code>ipcs -ls </code></pre>  <p>and received these results:</p>  <pre><code>------ Semaphore Limits -------- max number of arrays = 256 max semaphores per array = 500 max semaphores system wide = 64000 max ops per semop call = 128 semaphore max value = 32767 </code></pre>  <p>The type of load I get is often minimal, however at random times, the load is high for maybe 5 minutes (probably because new content is uploaded and hundreds of people browse the content seconds after). I feel as if everyone wants to visit the site all at once.</p>  <p>So my question then is are these values decent for a server with 81 apache processes or are any of these values too high/low? The server computer is 3.3Ghz with 4 CPUs and 8 GB ram.</p>
