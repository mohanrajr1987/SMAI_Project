<p>An object file is linked to generate an ELF file and its virtual address is determined. For example, the virtual address of .text is 0x8048000. When the ELF file is going to be mapped to virtual space, another ELF has already been mapped to this address.  What the operating system should do? Why the virtual address of ELF can be determined before it is mapped to virtual space.</p>
