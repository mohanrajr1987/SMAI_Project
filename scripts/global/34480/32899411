<p>I am running a local instance of neo4j ("Community" edition) on a Windows 10 laptop.  My client is in Java and uses the REST API (via port 7474) to talk with the neo4j database.</p>  <p>QUESTION:  is there some way to get the equivalent of a <code>MERGE/CREATE</code> directive in cypher to happen via the REST API call to <code>/db/data/node</code> endpoint?</p>  <p>I'm guessing that I could impose a unique constraint on different node types and achieve the desired behavior.  But out of the box, what I am hoping for is a single endpoint -- Eg, <code>/db/data/node</code> -- which either creates or merges the inbound data with any existing nodes in the graph.</p>
