<p>I am trying to implement a recommender using Mahout. My source database is a Neo4j graph database and I am able to fetch {userId,itemId,rates} values from it. However I do not know how to feed this input to Mahout to create a DataModel. Should I implement a Neo4jJdbcDataModel just like what we have for MySQL? I am a little bit confused so any hint would be appreciated.</p>  <p>P.S one workaround is to fetch data from Neo4j and save in into a csv and then feed the csv path to Mahout FileDataModel class. But this is a time consuming thing !! Specially when you have a large dataset !</p>
