<p>I Have relationships where there is a property on the relationship that is an array type. and I'm looking to get all relationships based on the array on the first rel, and then from then on, only find nodes connected where there is at least 1 common element. ie : </p>  <p>[a, b, c, d] ->(node)-[a, f, g]->     would link</p>  <p>but </p>  <p>[a,b,c,d]->(node)-[r,f,g]->           would not link</p>  <pre><code>match (c:Company {RegistrationNumber : 'regNumber'}), c&lt;-[r]-(n) with n, c,r, extract(x in r.AlertIds | x) as alerts  match path= n-[*..7]-p with c, n, path,extract(alertP in rels(path) | alertP.AlertId) as ap,  extract(a in alerts | a) as alert  return distinct n,alert,c,rels(path), ap, nodes(path) </code></pre>  <p>The above cypher is looking a little crazy but basically I'm trying to get where any element in the array alerts (from the top part) is in any relationship found in the array in the rel on the second part.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated </p>  <p><strong>update 1</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://console.neo4j.org/?id=ee23d3" rel="nofollow">http://console.neo4j.org/?id=ee23d3</a></p>  <p>above link is hopefully something that can be used to better understand what i'm looking for.</p>  <p>I want to able to be able to find all links following any path where there are common AlertIds.</p>  <p>so in the example linked I want to only see 1 path being returned with nodes (3,2,1,0) and the AlertIds that were found in the path ie ("e1") </p>  <p>If this would be easier to do to say any paths where the links are followed with the last node being the first company (the one in the initial match). </p>  <p>I hope this helps</p>
