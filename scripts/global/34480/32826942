<p>I need to have vertices be uniquely identified and reached fast by every value in a set of values of one property (i.e. this property possibly have more then one value for one vertex), each value should be unique over all vertices (i.e. intersection of any vertex1.id property value (which is a set of vertex ids) with any other vertex2.id is empty, where vertex1 != vertex2)?</p>  <p>This is VERY powerful feature with far reaching implications and I can't find which graph-db engine have built-in facility providing this. </p>  <p>If there is no such built-in feature then may be there are workarounds to acheive this effects?</p>
