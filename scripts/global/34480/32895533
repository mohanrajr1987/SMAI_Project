<p>Currently, evaluating Neo4j for some data analytic. Where data from different database will be pushed to Neo4j Database periodically. These can have "Addition, modification as well as delete".</p>  <p>As the model how data is store in GraphDB and and in Origin SQL DB is different, we are think how to handle the add modify and delete scenarios?</p>  <ol> <li><p>Are there any standard Rules/Ways?</p></li> <li><p>Are there any tolls for sync? (Other than the CSV or similar imports)</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
