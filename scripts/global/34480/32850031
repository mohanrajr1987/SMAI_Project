<p>I set up a neo4j database on ec2 and am not sure how to access it with my restclient.  Firstly, how do I change the username and password once its on ec2 and running?  Also, what do I change my localhost to so I can access the server?</p>  <p>This is the example statement I want to know how to configure:</p>  <pre><code>from neo4jrestclient import client db = client.GraphDatabase("http://localhost:7474", username="neo4j", password="neo4j") </code></pre>
