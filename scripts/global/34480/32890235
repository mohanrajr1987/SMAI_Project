<p>My neo4j version is 2.1 and I am using neo4j-shell-tools_2.1.zip in order to export data to a csv file in neo4j shell.</p>  <p>In the csv output, I would like to data <strong>without quotes</strong> and the following command does not seem to work. Is the command only for 2.2 version?</p>  <pre><code>import-cypher -d , -o test.csv  match (p:Product)-[s:RELATED_TO]-(q:Product) return toInt(p.Id), toInt(q.Id) limit 3 </code></pre>  <p>The output of the above command in the test.csv looks like below.</p>  <pre><code>"toInt(p.Id)","toInt(q.Id)" "11505932","5944562" "9594143","5944562" "9594203","5944562" </code></pre>  <p>How can I output without quotes? Is it even possible? Thank you.</p>
