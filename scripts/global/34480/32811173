<p>So am trying out a couple of things in neo4j with spring-data-neo4j. Am trying to run the cineasts application - <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/blob/master/spring-data-neo4j-examples/cineasts/src/main/java/org/neo4j/cineasts/domain/Movie.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/blob/master/spring-data-neo4j-examples/cineasts/src/main/java/org/neo4j/cineasts/domain/Movie.java</a></p>  <p>The application works fine. I am trying to find a movie by id and that works fine except that it returns the actors for the movie but not directors. The relationship is exactly the same as specified in the Movie.java</p>  <p>I tried to turn on the DEBUG and I found that the query executed underneath is just  <code> MATCH (<code>movie</code>:<code>Movie</code>) WHERE <code>movie</code>.<code>id</code> = "603" return movie. </code> Could someone help me understand why the movie that is returned comes back with the actors but not directors?</p>  <p>appreciate your help.</p>  <p>thanks</p>
