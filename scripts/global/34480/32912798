<p>I have wikipedia data in a Cassandra table (one row = one wiki article). Now I want to insert this into a graph database so I could see the relations between them. What I tried so far is to get records from Cassandra one by one and add them as nodes in Neo4J but this is very slow. Is there a way using Neo4J/ Titan where the data could be automatically taken from Cassandra and a graph be built?</p>
