<p>I'm using neo4j through java and I was wondering if there's a way to save some metadata with that node. I wanted to be able to have a node from the graph include more information, for instance to have each node have a dictionary associated with it.</p>  <p>edit - A dictionary was just an example, I want to be able to associate also class instances which contain as one of the fields a dictionary for example.</p>
