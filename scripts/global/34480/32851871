<p>Spring Data Neo4j (SDN) 4.0 did away with @RelationshipType and @Labels, among other tools that could be used to implement dynamic typing or runtime polymorphism. In SDN 4.0 all polymorphic possibilities (labels and relationship types) must be modeled explicitly, statically, in Java prior to build time. Given those limitations, I am unable to migrate my SDN 3.x code, which took advantage of those features, forward.</p>  <p>I would appreciate any insight, work arounds, alternative tools, etc. anyone has to offer. The only alternative right now that I see is to unplug SDN and write directly to Neo4j.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
