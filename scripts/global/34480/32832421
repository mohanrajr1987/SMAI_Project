<p>i have a site I'm working on that matches people based on common interests or skills. I can connect them easily enough via Cyper to find others but what I would like to do is order then by the number of common connection they have. If person A's has 10 common interests with person B, I want they ordered above person C that only shares 4 common interests with person A. Bonus points if I can also count the number of common interests. Thanks!</p>
