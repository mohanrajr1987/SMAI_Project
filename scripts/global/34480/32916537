<p>I'm trying to use neo4j embedded in a Java application for a small project of mine. For this, I'm only using JDK Tools, so, there's no Eclipse, Net Beans or IntelliJ IDEA.</p>  <p>I've tried to follow the tutorial supplied by Neo4j (<a href="http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/tutorials-java-embedded-setup.html" rel="nofollow">Include Neo4j in your project</a>) , but I'm somehow doing it wrong, since it doesn't work.</p>  <p>To sum up, I've got a small .java file, let's say it's only composed of the bare necessities to work and an import of org.neo4j</p>  <pre><code>import org.neo4j; // or org.neo4j.*, or anything else that starts with that  public class Application {     // only the bare necessities to work } </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to compile this simple code with javac using -classpath to specify where to find Neo4j libraries, just like it's showed in the tutorial</p>  <pre><code>javac -g -cp "C:/Path/to/libs/Neo4j Community/jre/lib" Application.java </code></pre>  <p>But each time, the compilation fail at the line of the import, saying that the package doesn't exist. And of course, once this line is erased, the compilation succeed.</p>  <p>I've already tried to move the libs inside the project's folder, and I've tried to download the neo4j kernel jar and put it inside the Neo4j's folder and the project's folder, but, none of these solutions have worked.</p>  <p>If anyone could help me, I would be very thankful to him.</p>  <p>Cordially, Jaxon</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> : When I try to compile with the following command :</p>  <pre><code>javac -g -cp "C:\Path\to\libs\Neo4j Community\jre\lib\*" Application.java </code></pre>  <p>The error stays and two warnings appear. I don't know if it's related, but here are the errors :</p>  <pre><code>warning: Supported source version 'RELEASE_7' from annotation processor 'org.neo4j.kernel.impl.annotations.ServiceProcessor' less than -source '1.8' warning: Supported source version 'RELEASE_7' from annotation processor 'org.neo4j.kernel.impl.annotations.DocumentationProcessor' less than -source '1.8' Application.java:4: error: package org.neo4j does not exist import org.neo4j.*; ^ 1 error 2 warnings </code></pre>
