<p>How can we use neoclient without any framework .Because we are not using <code>laravel</code> or <code>symphony</code> even we are  using nothing like these frameworks.Our backend is written pure core PHP. Simply my question is that if we are not using any framework for core purposes then why should we use them to just use a dbms .</p>  <p>When i calculated the size of vendor folder it was of <code>102 MB</code>. So a single request will use up a large part of ram. Its my guess that while using Neo-client the all files contained in vendor folder will be loaded. so please correct me and if neoclient can be used separately I will be very happy to use that, but please must tell what will be the cons of using Neo-Client without dependencies.</p>
