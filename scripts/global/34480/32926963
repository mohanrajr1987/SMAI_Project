<p>I have created a neo4j DB locally and assigned some indices and unique constraint.</p>  <p>Here is the :schema</p>  <pre><code>Indexes   ON :Actor(social_id) ONLINE (for uniqueness constraint)    ON :Category(name)   ONLINE (for uniqueness constraint)   Constraints   ON (actor:Actor) ASSERT actor.social_id IS UNIQUE   ON (category:Category) ASSERT category.name IS UNIQUE </code></pre>  <p>Additionally I do a createIfNotFound() in my java code, where I first do a find and then create if not found.</p>  <p>Inspite of these two checks I still see multiple nodes of Label category and same name existing in the DB. </p>  <pre><code> MATCH (n:Category) WHERE n.name='garden' RETURN n  name    garden name    garden name    garden name    garden Returned 4 rows in 49 ms. </code></pre>  <p>I am not sure what I am missing, and why is the unique constraint not being honored.</p>
