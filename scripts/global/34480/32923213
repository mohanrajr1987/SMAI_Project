<p>I know that I can represent any relation as a RDF triplet as in: </p>  <p><code>Barack Obama -&gt; president of -&gt; USA</code></p>  <p>(I am aware that this is not RDF, I am just illustrating)</p>  <p>but how do I add the time dimension? I mean he is in his second presidential period and any period last only for a lapse of time. And, How about after and before  his presidential periods?</p>
