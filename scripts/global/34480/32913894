<p>How do I apply AllShortestPaths() on certain edges only between two defined vertices?</p>  <p>Here is the query:</p>  <pre><code>MATCH     (from: SHIPPING_NODE {...}),     (to: SHIPPING_NODE {...}),      paths = allShortestPaths((from)-[connection:CONNECT*]-&gt;(to)) WITH     .... RETURN delay_min, delay_max, price, route </code></pre>  <p>When I add <code>WHERE connection.field_value &gt; 10</code> to the query, I get the following:</p>  <pre><code>Type mismatch: expected Map, Node or Relationship but was Collection&lt;Relationship&gt; (line 5, column 7 (offset: 267)) "WHERE connection.field_value &gt; 10" connection has some fields that I need to select specifically </code></pre>  <p>Note: I can clear the error by removing the star (*) from <code>allShortestPaths((from)-[connection:CONNECT*]-&gt;(to))</code> but then nothing gets returned anymore</p>
