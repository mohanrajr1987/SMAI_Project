<p>I am trying to make database of Bookstore where customers can buy books. There is lables Book, BookCategory, Customer, Invoice. I am using relation INVOICEITEM between invoice and books. i added property <strong>netTotal</strong> in invoice to store the sum value of books related in INVOICEITEM with invoice. I tried to get total value of books which is related to invoice.</p>  <pre><code>MATCH (n:Invoice {id:'inv001'})-[:INVOICEITEM]-&gt;m RETURN SUM(m.price) </code></pre>  <p>and i tried to change netTotal propery of invoice by using this command.</p>  <pre><code>MATCH (n:Invoice{ id: 'inv001' }) SET n.netTotal = ((n:Invoice {id:'inv001'})-[:INVOICEITEM]-&gt; m RETURN SUM(m.price)) </code></pre>  <p>but it returns an error. I am new to neo4j and thank you.</p>
