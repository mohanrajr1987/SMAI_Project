<p>I've been trying to writhe the following task in cypher query but I am not getting the right results. Other stackoverflow questions discuss limit or collect but I do not think that is enough to do the following task.</p>  <p>Task:  I have (p:Product) nodes and between two product nodes there is a relationship called "BOUGHT_TOGETHER". That is </p>  <pre><code>(p:Product)-[b:BOUGHT_TOGETHER]-(q:Product) </code></pre>  <p>And the relationship b has a property called "size" which contains some number. I want to return top 3 results for each product relationship which is ordered by the size. For instance, the query result should look like the following.</p>  <pre><code>+------------------------+ | p.id  | q.id | b.size      | +------------------------+    1      2      10    1      3       8    1      5       7    2      21      34    2      17      20    2      35      15    3      5       49    3      333     30    3       65      5    .       .       .    .       .       .    .       .       . </code></pre>  <p>Can someone show me how to write a cypher query in order to achieve the desired results? Thank you!</p>
