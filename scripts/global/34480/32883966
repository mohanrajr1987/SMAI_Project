<p>Is something wrong with this cypher query</p>  <pre><code>MATCH (owner:SidNode)&lt;-[:OWNED_BY]-(acl:AclNode)-[:SECURES]-&gt;(class:ClassNode)  OPTIONAL MATCH (acl)&lt;-[:COMPOSES]-(ace:AceNode)-[:AUTHORIZES]-&gt;(sid:SidNode)  WITH acl, ace, owner, sid, class      WHERE  (acl.objectIdIdentity = {objectIdIdentity1} AND class.className = {className1})    RETURN  owner.principal AS aclPrincipal,  owner.sid AS aclSid,  acl.objectIdIdentity AS objectIdIdentity,  ace.aceOrder AS aceOrder,  ID(acl) AS aclId,  acl.parentObject AS parentObject,  acl.entriesInheriting AS entriesInheriting,  ID(ace) AS aceId, ace.mask AS mask,  ace.granting AS granting,  ace.auditSuccess AS auditSuccess,  ace.auditFailure AS auditFailure,  sid.principal AS acePrincipal,  sid.sid AS aceSid,  class.className AS className   ORDER BY acl.objectIdIdentity ASC, ace.aceOrder ASC </code></pre>  <p>It is returning null values for ace nodes even though there are multiple nodes available in graph db. But some times it is returning proper values like 4 rows if there are 4 ace nodes in db. code i am writing is about spring security acl  reference link: <a href="https://github.com/shazin/spring-security-acl-neo4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/acls/neo4j/Neo4jLookupStrategy.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/shazin/spring-security-acl-neo4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/acls/neo4j/Neo4jLookupStrategy.java</a></p>  <p>Please suggest modifications.</p>
