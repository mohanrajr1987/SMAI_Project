<p>I have problem putting Hebrew string in a variable like this:</p>  <pre><code>wchar_t* hebrewString = L"א"; </code></pre>  <p>The value in unicode of <strong>א</strong> is <code>0x05d0</code> in hex or 1488 in dec.</p>  <p>The problem is that my memory show different value that totally unconnected  to the real value of <strong>א</strong>.</p>  <p>If I write: </p>  <pre><code>wchar_t hebrewChar = 0x05d0  </code></pre>  <p>it is obvious that the right value will be in <code>hebrewChar</code>, but I want to write regular string.</p>  <p>I thought maybe I did something wrong so I looked up in the generate <em>ASM</em> code and even there it was wrong value.</p>  <p>How can I write Hebrew string in a simple way?</p>  <hr>  <h2>Edit 1:</h2>  <p>add source code(in comment above the code is the assembly)</p>  <pre><code>wchar_t d = 0x05D0; // DB 0f3H, 05H, 090H, 00H, 00H, 00H wchar_t *test = L"א"; // mov  eax, 1523               ; 000005f3H wchar_t test1 = L'א'; // mov  eax, -112               ; ffffff90H char test2 = 'א'; </code></pre>
