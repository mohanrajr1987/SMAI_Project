<p>We are shifting a number of projects from Delphi 2007 to XE8 and have a number of the following warning (many hundreds of them):</p>  <pre><code>[dcc32 Warning] X.PAS(1568): W1050 WideChar reduced to byte char in set expressions.  Consider using 'CharInSet' function in 'SysUtils' unit.` </code></pre>  <p>It occurs to me that many of these are of the form</p>  <pre><code>if x in ['1','2','3'] then </code></pre>  <p>which need to be converted to</p>  <pre><code>if CharInSet(x, ['1','2','3']) then </code></pre>  <p>And this looks like there might be some sort of regular expression type search and replace that could be used to do these in bulk.</p>  <p>Can anyone think of a way to convert these in bulk?</p>
