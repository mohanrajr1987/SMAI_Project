<p>So I'm trying to make a table with a csv table that has unicode characters in it:</p>  <pre><code>with open('test1.csv', 'w') as csvfile:     writer = csv.writer(csvfile)     [writer.writerow(r) for r in table] </code></pre>  <p>I get this error every time i try to run my program, though:</p>  <pre><code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 8-10: ordinal not in range(128) </code></pre>  <p>How do I fix this?</p>
