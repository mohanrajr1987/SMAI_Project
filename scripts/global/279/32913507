<p>I'm curious is this possible.  I want to send an SMS message from a web application (AngularJS) and want to be able to send emojis. Is it possible to send the emoji as it's unicode representation as plain text </p>  <p>Example: Hello U+1F601  Would display: Hello üòÅ</p>  <p>Obviously sending this as text will not work. I'll just recieve Hello U+1F601 </p>  <p>Is this possible by somehow prefixing or wrapping the unicode somehow?</p>
