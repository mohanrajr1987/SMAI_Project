<p>I am developing a project where I need to store around 15k <em>Unicode</em> characters. What would be the best way to store this?</p>  <p>The main application is in C# and some other data is stored in a SQL Server DB. This huge amount of text needs to in someway be identifiable by a randomly generated entry key and a category key. Obviously, there may/should be more than one entry that has the same category key.</p>  <p>These entries will be added, retrieved, and also searched using keywords by category key.</p>  <p>I am currently looking at the following 2 ways: (Other ideas more than welcome)</p>  <hr>  <h2>Files</h2>  <p>Each category key represented as a folder and each entry as a file using the entry key as the file name.</p>  <p>To search I would just use the Apache Lucene.Net project to build an index and just search by it.</p>  <hr>  <h2>SQL Server</h2>  <p>Just stored as another column of type <code>NVARCHAR(MAX)</code> in a table.</p>  <hr>  <p>Which of these ways is best? I am looking for other options, and pros/cons about these.</p>
