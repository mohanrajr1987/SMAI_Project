<p>I'm trying to understand the vagaries of printing unicode in R in a windows 7 environment. I'm trying to include a unicode character in a dataframe so that I can get the ≥ symbol in plots and in csv exports.</p>  <p>Using RStudio, I can do</p>  <pre><code>require(dplyr) require(ggplot2)  test &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c(4,5,6), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) test test &lt;- test %&gt;% mutate(x2 = ifelse(x == 1, "1 day",                                      ifelse(x == 2, "2 days",                                            ifelse(x &gt;= 3, "\u2265 3 days", NA)))) test    x y       x2 1 1 4    1 day 2 2 5   2 days 3 3 6 = 3 days </code></pre>  <p>However, if I do </p>  <pre><code>table(test$x2) </code></pre>  <p>I get </p>  <pre><code>≥ 3 days    1 day   2 days         1        1        1 </code></pre>  <p>When I try to export the dataframe to csv, the ≥ symbol is rendered as = when viewing with Excel.  I also want to plot my data in ggplot, with the ≥ symbol as a label. Unfortunately, when I do </p>  <pre><code>ggplot(test, aes(x=x2, y=y)) + geom_point() </code></pre>  <p>The symbol prints as '= 3 days' rather than '≥ 3 days'. I understand that I can successfully specify </p>  <pre><code>+ scale_x_discrete(labels=c("\U2265 3 days", "1 day", "2 days")) </code></pre>  <p>And the symbol will print successfully, but I'd much rather draw the label from the dataframe itself. </p>  <p>I have 3 questions</p>  <ol> <li>How can I get the ≥ symbol to print in ggplot using entries from a dataframe?</li> <li>How can I export a dataframe to csv and retain the desired ≥ symbol, rather than it degrading to '='?</li> <li>What have I failed to understand about printing unicode in windows? (optional, potentially a lot.)</li> </ol>  <p>I understand that these problems don't arise in mac or linux, but unfortunately at work these are not options. </p>
