<p>I have a string in python3 that has emojis in it and I want to treat the emojis as their unicode representation. I need to do some manipulation on the emoji in this format. </p>  <pre><code>s = 'ðŸ˜¬ ðŸ˜Ž hello' </code></pre>  <p>This treats each emoji as its own character such that <code>len(s) == 9</code> &amp;&amp; <code>s[0] == ðŸ˜¬</code></p>  <p>I want to be change the format of the string so that it is in unicode points such that </p>  <pre><code>s = 'ðŸ˜¬ ðŸ˜Ž hello' u = to_unicode(s)   # Some function to change the format. print(u) # '\ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude0e hello' u[0] == '\ud83d' and u[1] == '\ude2c' len(u) == 11 </code></pre>  <p>Any thoughts on creating a function <code>to_unicode</code> that will take s and change it into u? I could be thinking about how strings/unicode works in python3 wrong so any help/corrections would be greatly appreciated.</p>
