<p>I have made a table as a php variable, which includes a bunch of jquery mobile code. I echo this php table variable from another php document (which produces the data for the table). The variable is in an included file.</p>  <p>The table contains the following string: "CO₂, pounds".</p>  <p>The subscript "2" is unicode U-2082.</p>  <p>However, when that variable is echoed into my browser (Chrome),  "CO₂," shows like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yl63z.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yl63z.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>i.e., that weird "a" followed by two commas (the third comma is, I think, the actual comma).</p>  <p>The  tag in the jqm document (which is included as part of the echoed php variable) is the following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta charset='utf-8'&gt;     &lt;meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1'&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I researched the problem, and all suggestions are to make sure the charset is UTF-8, but that is what I already have in the meta tag in the variable which is echoed.</p>  <p>If I display another (identical) jqm document directly in my browser, i.e. NOT by turning that document's script into a php variable, then "CO₂" displays properly.</p>  <p>Anybody have any idea why my browser is behaving this way?</p>
