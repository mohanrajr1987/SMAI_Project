<p>From server, I am receiving a response in HTML unicode characters like <code>&amp;#x9053;</code> . In my device, I need to convert these characters to Java Unicode characters.</p>  <p>I browsed through online. I found some few solutions using <code>StringEscapeUtils.unescapeHtml4()</code> using apache common library. But I don't use this. </p>  <p>Is there any method in JAVA to convert these characters or if we wrote functions that just replaces <code>&amp;#x</code> with <code>\u</code> will it be reliable and consistent ?</p>  <p>Can somebody please help ?</p>
