<p>I need the copyright symbol like this 'â“’'. I did googling how to use this, and got the answer, Unicode <code>\u00a9</code>. But on some (Android) devices, it shows up bold. (I don't know how can explain... 'c' looks good but the circle around it looks bold.) So my colleague says to use <code>\u24d2</code>. Yes, it looks perfect on every device, but I don't know if it's proper. What's the difference between <code>\u00a9</code> and <code>\u24d2</code>?</p>
