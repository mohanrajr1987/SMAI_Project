<p>Is there any way to correctly upload unicode filenames to S3 using s3cmd from an OS X machine? </p>  <p>The problem is the following:</p>  <ol> <li>OS X uses NFD filenames, Linux/BSD and Amazon uses NFC (for static file serving).</li> <li>When using <code>rsync</code>, I can specify the <code>--iconv=UTF8-MAC,UTF-8</code> switch, which does the correct file-name conversion.</li> <li>However when using s3cmd, the file name conversion does not happen, thus non-ascii files cannot be accessed from the web (using their original URL), as their names are now in NFD form. </li> </ol>  <p>The only workaround I know for this issue is to upload the files to a Linux/BSD server and run s3cmd from there. </p>  <p>Is there any solution to this which does not involve using a Linux/BSD host?</p>
