<p>I have this folder with a bunch of csv files, that I want to import into SQL Server. That works fine with BULK INSERT.</p>  <p>However I have a problem with the encoding, getting weird charters in the db - if I open the csv files in notepad, and save them again as unicode, it works perfect.</p>  <p>Is their a way in C# to programmaticly, convert all files in a folder to unicode?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
