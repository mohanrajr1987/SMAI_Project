<p>I'm currently trying to construct a database of chemicals used in a university department, and their hazard classes. I then wish to output to a csv file. One step is to pull all the synonyms for the various chemicals from standard PDFs, such as this for gamma hexalactone:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/MSDS/MSDS/DisplayMSDSPage.do?country=GB&amp;language=en&amp;productNumber=W255602&amp;brand=ALDRICH&amp;PageToGoToURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sigmaaldrich.com%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%3Fterm%3Dgamma%2Bhexalactone%26interface%3DAll%26N%3D0%26mode%3Dmatch%2520partialmax%26lang%3Den%26region%3DGB%26focus%3Dproduct" rel="nofollow">sample PDF</a></p>  <p>At the moment, the code I'm using to extract the text just loses the greek characters which I need to transfer. It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>pdfReader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(inpathf) txtObj = '' for pageNum in range (0, pdfReader.numPages):                  pageObj = pdfReader.getPage(pageNum)                 txtObj += str(pageObj.extractText())              inpathf.close()             outputf.write(txtObj)             outputf.close()              return txtObj </code></pre>  <p>Parameters are extracted from ~2000 PDFs and stored in a dictionary before being transferred to a csv file:</p>  <pre><code>def Outfile_csv(outfile, dict1, length): outputfile = open((outfile) + '.csv', 'w', newline ='')  output_list = []   outputWriter = csv.writer(outputfile) outputWriter.writerow(['PDF file', 'Name', 'Synonyms', 'CAS No.', 'H statements',                        'TWA limits /ppm', 'STEL limits /ppm'])  for r in range (0, length):     output_list =[]      for s in range (0,7):         if s == 0 or s == 3:             output_list.append(str((dict1[s][r])).encode('utf-8'))         else:                        output_list.append(str(dict1[s][r]))      outputWriter.writerow(output_list)    outputfile.close() </code></pre>  <p>I also can't read out to the CSV in cases where there are greek characters - those data are simply not placed in the csv file. Many thanks for any help - a day playing with codecs and the contents of stackexchange has not helped yet. I'm using Python 3.4 and Windows 8.</p>
