<p>We have a C# website that is hosted using Azure Cloud Services and uses PDF Sharp to generate PDF documents.  </p>  <p>We are using the Arial Unicode MS Regular font since we have Japanese fonts to display. When the website is run locally (from Visual Studio on Windows 7) the fonts render correctly.</p>  <p>We use a start-up script for Azure to install the font onto the Cloud Service servers since its not installed by default. I have verified that the font is installed on the Cloud Service servers (Windows Server 2012).</p>  <p>In the Azure hosted website the Japanese fonts appear as squares, even though the PDF properties do indicate that the font used is Arial Unicode MS Regular.</p>  <p>Any ideas why the font is not being correctly used on the Cloud Service servers?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WtqT3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WtqT3.png" alt="The PDF generated by Windows 2012 server running on Azure.
