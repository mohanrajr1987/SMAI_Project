<p>I'm finding Unicode for special characters from <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/search.htm" rel="nofollow">FileFormat.Info's search</a>. </p>  <p>Some characters are rendering as the classic black-and-white glyphs, such as ⚠ (warning sign, <code>\u26A0</code> or <code>&amp;#x26a0;</code>). These are preferable, since I can apply CSS styles (such as color) to them. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mRrUw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mRrUw.png" alt="image of warning glyph"></a></p>  <p>Others are rendering as newer cartoony emoji, such as ⌛ (hourglass, <code>\u231B</code> or <code>&amp;#x231b;</code>). These are not preferable, since I cannot fully style them. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/niqCz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/niqCz.png" alt="image of hourglass emoji"></a></p>  <p>It appears that the browser is making this change, since I'm able to see the hourglass glyph on Mac Firefox, just not Mac Chrome nor Mac Safari. </p>  <p>Is there a way to force browsers to display the older (flat monotone) versions to display? </p>
