<p>I've been doing some research on different encoding techniques and standards, but I have one question, really. </p>  <p>Why would anyone want to use anything other than a Unicode encoding?</p>  <p>I mean, UTF-8 supports practically every ASCII character in a single byte. That's hard to beat. It even handles CJK ideographs! "<em>That means, information that two or more Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters actually represent the same character in slightly different writing methods.</em>" <a href="http://kunststube.net/encoding/" rel="nofollow">[Extracted from kunststube]</a></p>  <p>There has to be a reason. What are its limitations/setbacks?</p>
