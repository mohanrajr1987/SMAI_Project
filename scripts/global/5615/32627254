<p>My task is to disable sslv3 in my jetty-8-1-14. I went through this link: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26382540/how-to-disable-the-sslv3-protocol-in-jetty-to-prevent-poodle-attack">How to disable sslv3 in jetty8 </a> </p>  <p>But to change the code I need to check the current status of sslv3 for jetty8 server.</p>  <p>Is there any command by which I can get whether the sslv3 is enable or not?</p>
