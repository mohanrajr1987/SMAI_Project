<p>I have Solr 5.2.1 running under Jetty on a Linux Server and the application that connects to Solr is running on another server in the same network at Rackspace. I've closed port 8983 on the Solr server to block public access to the Solr Admin, but that means the application cannot connect to Solr.</p>  <p>I've tried using the private network that runs between the two servers, but have not found any way to connect the application to Solr this way without direct access to port 8983. </p>  <p>While I know little about Jetty, I've tried to find a solution there, or reconfiguring localhost, but no success. </p>  <p>Sorry but I don't have any real examples to provide, as I've been casting about in the dark for a solution as I know very little about connecting server to server.</p>  <p>Any helpful advice would be most appreciated.</p>
