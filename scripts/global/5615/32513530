<p>I am trying to find out if it is possible to do proxy authentication in Java using jetty. I have been able to do basic and digest authentication schemes using jetty and there are easy ways in Jetty to set up these authentication schemes using pseudo code as this:</p>  <pre><code>constraint = org.mortbay.jetty.security.Constraint(); constraint.setName(constraint.('__BASIC_AUTH')) constraint.setRoles({'admin'}); constraint.setAuthenticate(true); constraintMapping = ConstraintMapping(); constraintMapping.setConstraint(constraint); constraintMapping.setPathSpec('/*'); securityHandler = SecurityHandler(); securityHandler.setUserRealm(myrealm); securityHandler.setConstraintMappings(constraintMapping ); </code></pre>  <p>Similarly for DIGEST authentication __BASIC_AUTH can be replaced with __DIGEST_AUTH. I am using HttpServlets to handle requests/responses. However if I want to achieve proxy based authentication, how do I do this?</p>  <p>Do I need to use the httpservlet's doGet() and attempt authentication and explicit forwarding to another address or is there a way using jetty itself to setup a proxy based authentication(or a proxy localhost server) as shown in the pseudo above? </p>  <p>Can I get some help for code to do proxy based authentication that authenticates and forwards HttpServlet requests to another servlet/server? </p>
