<p>I'm running a maven dynamic web project, which is deployed in jetty. In order to access COM-Objects, I want to use the Java COM Bridge (JACOB). JACOB comes with a .jar and a .dll. I added the .jar to the build path of the project but I don't know exactly what to do with the .dll. While running the webservice, I always get  </p>  <p><strong>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.jacob.com.ComFailException.</strong></p>  <p>How do I make sure that the .dll will be deployed on the webserver and can be used by the webservice?  Or is it maybe a problem with the .jar, because com.jacob.com.ComFailException is part of jacob.jar?</p>  <p>Thanks, Chris</p>
