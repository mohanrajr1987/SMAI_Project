<p>I have a <code>Jetty</code> client sending request to my <code>Jetty</code> server at <code>localhost:8080</code>.</p>  <p>I'd like to add some proxies between them. It seems that it's not possible to do it with <code>Jetty</code> itself, as it's <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32785018/configuring-jetty-websocket-client-to-use-proxy/32785920#32785920">not supporting the feature</a> </p>  <p>Is there another way to setup proxies? Something that would redirect my requests from my clientto the proxy which would itself send it to the server?</p>
