<p>I would like to use Jetty as a web application server. My deployed application needs to use a https client (my war calls an external web service). I have the Authority certificate (CA) as a file.</p>  <p>What  I have suppose to do, because each time I call the external web service, i get an error (certification path error).</p>  <p>I suppose i have to add the CA to a truststore associated to jetty ?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>
