<p>I am creating a very simple web app. Basically, I have a list of games I can add games to (with a simple HTML form). When you make POST request, game is being created in <code>doPost()</code> and <code>doGet()</code> is called to show new list of games. The problem is when you just refreh a page, the last game is being added again and again, but if you go to the same page via URL and refrest after that, no games are being added. I think some cache is being created, but I haven't found a way to clear it. How to do it and what is being created?</p>
