<p>I wonder if it is possible to start a TLS connection via a SSLSocket and pass the existing connection somehow into my embedded Jetty - does anybody know how I can do this?</p>  <p>My current setup allows to start Jetty and to receive HTTP(S) requests. Jetty starts the handshake and I have a successful secured TLS connection. However, I received the requirement to handle it slightly different.  Jetty shall be started with an already established TLS connection.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
