<p>I have written a filter called RequestFilter (implements Filter interface) to get HTTP headers of each request. And I added this filter using the following code in Dropwizard run function. </p>  <pre><code>environment.servlets().addFilter("RequestFilter", new RequestFilter()); </code></pre>  <p>doFilter doesn't get called on sending a request. </p>  <p>Any hints on why it is not working? </p>
