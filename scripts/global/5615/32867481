<p>I have a problem similar to the one described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17005292/resteasy-bean-validation-not-being-invoked">here</a>. </p>  <p>I am using Resteasy within a Jetty application. When I start the application locally and call a service from my REST API (e.g. <em>localhost:16880/rest/user/login</em>) bean validation works fine; e.g. I get validation errors like this:</p>  <pre><code>[PARAMETER] [UserService#login(arg0).appKey] [app_key may not be null or empty] [] </code></pre>  <p>However, when I deploy my application to a remote host and call the same service (e.g. <em>remotehost:16880/rest/user/login</em>) bean validation is not invoked at all. I am using the <code>@ValidateRequest</code> annotation for the service and <code>@Valid</code> annotation for the bean parameter.</p>  <p>My Resteasy version is 3.0.13.Final, though I have tried earlier versions as well. I have tried to write my custom validator, but that didn't work either.</p>  <p>I am puzzled why the validation works locally, but not on remote server. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. </p>
