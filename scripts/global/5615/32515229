<p>normally figure stuff out but I've been stuck on this one for a couple days now.. building up a simple jetty server. the server runs, and localhost:8080 pulls up the right index.html file. but I'm trying to run a java back-end using @GET and @PATH annotations, but none of the paths I try seem to work. say I have the following:</p>  <pre><code>@Resource @Path("hello") public class AjaxCalls{     @PATH("sayHi")     @GET     public String test(){         return "Hi";   //breakpoint set here to see if we hit the method     } } </code></pre>  <p>I would think that an ajax call to the url: localhost:8080/hello/sayHi would at least hit the breakpoint, but no luck. Anyone take this approach before? I'm sure it's some small detail...</p>
