<p>I have an application served by Jetty and the whole application is secured through  <code>org.eclipse.jetty.security.LoginService</code>. The application layout is something like:</p>  <pre><code>MyApp   |   +--WebContent          |          +--- app.js          |          +--- public/list.xml          |          +--- private </code></pre>  <p>I would like to keep my <em>app.js</em> and <em>private folder</em> content protected against anonymous user access, but I would like anyone be able to access <em>MyApp/public/list.xml</em> file through <a href="http://example.com/MyApp/public/list.xml" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/MyApp/public/list.xml</a></p>  <p>What is the jetty configuration I can use for that?</p>
