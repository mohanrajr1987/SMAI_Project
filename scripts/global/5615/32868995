<p><b>My use case is to configure Dropwizard and / or its embedded Jetty for high volume of REST requests.</b></p>  <p>Jetty tuning is possible for connectors (for instance). I've found that SelectChannelConnector is interesting, but official Dropwizard documentation does not mention it.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.dropwizard.io/manual/configuration.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropwizard.io/manual/configuration.html</a></p>  <p>This connector uses efficient NIO buffers with a non-blocking threading model. Jetty uses Direct NIO buffers, and allocates threads only to connections with requests.</p>  <p>Any suggestions about yaml or java configuration? Thanks.</p>
