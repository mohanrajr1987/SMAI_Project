<p>I am trying to hook up a dropwizard 0.8.* application, and I have used a hello world starter example.</p>  <p>The code is left untouched and the application starts-up normally.</p>  <p>Though when I try to access the path assigned to the hello world GET request, the browser returns a :</p>  <pre><code>HTTP ERROR 404  Problem accessing /hello-world. Reason:      Not Found </code></pre>  <p>This is kinda strange since the app logs say otherwise and return 200 for that request:</p>  <pre><code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [15/Sep/2015:07:33:58 +0000] "GET /hello-world HTTP/1.1" 200 - "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.85 Safari/537.36" 0 </code></pre>  <p>Am I missing anything in terms of configuration or else ? I am running under OSX and google Chrome.</p>  <p>Adding more information I have tried two different hello-world examples and both fail. On top with spring boot and also akka-http I have no problems.</p>
