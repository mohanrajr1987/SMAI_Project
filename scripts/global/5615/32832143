<p>I have built a simple framework with maven, spring, hibernate and RESTEasy, and am using jetty mavne plugin to run/debug it. I am using postman to post a simple test data to my 'PermitAll' url but constantly getting 403 error :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>HTTP ERROR 403</p>      <p>Problem accessing /test/permitall. Reason:</p>  <pre><code>Expected CSRF token not found. Has your session expired? Powered by Jetty:// 9.3.3.v20150827 </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>I guess jetty meddling here. how can i disable it?</p>  <p>Note: I am using spring-security and jwt to store tokens in cookies and it is kind of half me half spring approach. </p>
