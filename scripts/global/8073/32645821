<p>We are looking at the WSO2 Governance Registry tool to help us in enforcing governance - specifically v5.0 (and the dependency graphing is awesome).  When using the publisher to add a server, one of the elements to capture is the type of server.  </p>  <p>Currently it lists the WSO2 server types and 'Generic Server'.  I would like to extend the list of server types to reflect what is being used here.</p>  <p>I managed to find the location of the server configuration using the Carbon browser and have added the types.  </p>  <p>However, the Publisher still shows the original list.  But when I view a specific server's details in the Carbon browser, I can see the values I've added and I can edit a server's details to reflect the applicable type.  </p>  <p>However, the moment I view the server details in the Publisher it shows the updated value, but on editing the field, only the original drop down list without my changes are shown.</p>  <p>Is the publisher's list of server types stored in a different location?  I edited the list found here: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>system/config/repository/components/orgâ€¦governance/configuration/server</p> </blockquote>
