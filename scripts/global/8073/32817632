<p>I am creating a hosted system where multiple customers can send messages. I am receiving thoses messages on a JMS queue.</p>  <p>Now, all processing is done in a similar way and I want my process to poll all incoming queues for messages and handle them. Is there a way in WSO2 ESB to subscribe to multiple queues?</p>  <p>If not possible, the workaround would be to create a seperate listener process for each queue and have this post the message to a central processing queue. But that seems to be a less clean solution (and I think it will scale worse than listening to multiple queues).</p>  <p>Any ideas on this?</p>
