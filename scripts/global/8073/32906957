<p>I am trying to simply host a REST service as a proxy service in WSO2 ESB. I am using Custom Proxy to do this. When I run the created proxy, I am not able to pass parameters to the proxy service at run time. How do I do this?</p>  <p>My REST service will be hit on a URL of format:<a href="http://ip:host/requestMapping/">http://ip:host/requestMapping/</a>{name}</p>  <p>The parameter 'name' has to be passed from the UI through the ESB to the service through a proxy service hosted on the ESB. Can you help me with the steps to follow to make this work?</p>  <p>I tried using this page: <a href="http://wso2.com/library/articles/2013/12/restful-integration-with-wso2-esb/" rel="nofollow">http://wso2.com/library/articles/2013/12/restful-integration-with-wso2-esb/</a></p>  <p>But that is for creating APIs which I have been successfully in creating. But I am unable to do this using Proxy services.</p>  <p>Basically in my program, when the user interacts with the UI, he enters a name as input. This name has to be passed to the proxy service hosted in the ESB which should forward this as a path variable to my REST service.</p>  <p>Right now, my service body is:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;inSequence&gt;   &lt;send&gt;    &lt;endpoint&gt;    &lt;http method="POST" uri-template="http://ip:port/resourceMapping/{uri.var.name}"&gt;&lt;/http&gt;      &lt;/endpoint&gt;    &lt;/send&gt; &lt;/inSequence&gt; &lt;outSequence&gt;   &lt;send&gt;&lt;/send&gt; &lt;/outSequence&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I run this, instead of sending the name as entered by the user, it sends "uri.var.name" to the REST service. On the other hand, if I define a property tag and define a value for it and then do this, the REST service gets the value of the property that I have set. But I need this value to be sent dynamically by the user so I can't define property and value inside.</p>  <p>Please help me.</p>
