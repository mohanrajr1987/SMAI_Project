<p>I'm looking for some guidance about two specific WSO2 products, API Manager and Identity Server and for the best solution to solve the problem I'm going to explain below.</p>  <p>In my company, we are using ADFS 3.0 for Single Sign On support in our applications. However we are now building applications that will require OpenID Connect Specification (SPA's+Rest API's) and ADFS does not support this out of the box so we've decided to use WSO2 products for that purpose.</p>  <p>I already managed to install WSO2 Identity Server 5.0.0 SP1 and configured ADFS as a federated Identity Provider (the new applications will still have to authenticate users using ADFS). I also installed WSO2 API Manager 1.9.1 and configured it to use WSO2 Identity Server as the Key Manager (<a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER420/Configuring+the+Identity+Server+5.0.0+with+API+Manager+1.9.0" rel="nofollow">Configuration tutorial</a>).</p>  <p>Now the problem:</p>  <p>Using WSO2 Identity Server 5.0.0 SP1 I couldn't get the Logout feature to work due to the issue reported <a href="https://wso2.org/jira/browse/IDENTITY-3181" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It seems that this issue has been solved in version 5.1.0M4 so I tried to install version 5.1.0-alpha and managed to make the logout to work with ADFS (I tested it by enabling SSO for the carbon administration). However, now I'm not able to install the Key Manager feature through the carbon repositories due to incompatibilities.</p>  <p>As a result, with the first combination (wso2is 5.0.0 SP1/wso2am 1.9.1) I had the logout issue with ADFS and with the second combination (wso2is 5.1.0-alpha/wso2am 1.9.1), I'm not able to install the Key Manager feature in Identity Server.</p>  <p>Is there any way to apply a patch to solve the logout issue in the first combination? Is there a way to install the key manager feature on WSO2IS 5.1.0-alpha? Or can someone point me to another solution to solve this issue?</p>
