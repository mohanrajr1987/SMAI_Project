<p>The WSO2 Gateway returns this format of error message: </p>  <pre><code>{"fault":{"code":404,"type":"Status report","message":"Not Found",  "description":"The requested resource (/account-info/1.0/) is not available."}} </code></pre>  <p>But we have a standard format for all error messages that our microservices (which implement the APIs served by WSO2) return. We return a simple JSON object with two fields, error &amp; error_description. So that we can present a consistent interface to our users, in this particular case we would like to see the WSO2 Gateway return exactly this: </p>  <pre><code>{"error":"SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE","error_description":  "The requested resource (/account-info/1.0/) is not available."} </code></pre>  <p>and return the HTTP status code only in the header.</p>  <p>Can you please tell me what I need to do to achieve this. Thank you.</p>
