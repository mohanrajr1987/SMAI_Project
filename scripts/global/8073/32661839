<p>Is it possible to generate JWTs without enabling caching on the Key Manager?  If it's not, is it safe to have both Gateway and KeyManager caching turned on?</p>  <p>We are running API Manager with IS serving as the Key Manager.  It appears that if I disable Key Manager Caching (EnableKeyMgtValidationInfoCache=false) JWT tokens are no longer sent to the back end, even though EnableTokenGeneration=true.  </p>  <p>With them both on I get JWTs as expected.  If I set EnableKeyMgtValidationInfoCache=false and change nothing else, the JWTs are absent.</p>  <p>We have Gateway Caching enabled and wish to keep it enabled for performance reasons, but <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM191/Configuring+Caching#ConfiguringCaching-Keycache" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> says that having them both on is "not recommended".</p>  <p>For reference here are the configuration settings I've tried and my results:</p>  <pre> EnableGateway |  EnableKeyMgt  | Enable   | Result   KeyCache    | ValidationInfo | JWTCache |               |     Cache      |          |  --------------+----------------+----------+      true     |     false      |   false  | No JWT      true     |     false      |   true   | No JWT      false    |     false      |   false  | No JWT      false    |     false      |   true   | No JWT      true     |     true       |   false  | Works.  This seems sub-optimal because the JWTs aren't being generated per request and we're double caching.      true     |     true       |   true   | Works.  Enable a separate JWT cache so that it changes more frequently, but those changes won't be seen until GW cache expires.      false    |     true       |   false  | Never tried this combo.      false    |     true       |   true   | Works.  This should produce a different JWT per request, but doesn't have GW caching.   </pre>  <ul> <li>APIM 1.9.1</li> <li>IS 5.0.0 with SP1</li> </ul>
