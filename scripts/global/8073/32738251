<p>I have a requirement where I need to send an alert if N responses are not received within a specified time. </p>  <p>Simply to say, I send the request (5 users) and wait for response from the user. If all the 5 users responded in 5 minutes, I can close the request, else send the alert.</p>  <p>In the case of a non occurrence, how to trigger the particular rule?</p>  <p>Drools has timer, which will repeat based on interval. </p>  <p>Can anyone explain how to achieve this drools /WSO2 BRS?</p>
