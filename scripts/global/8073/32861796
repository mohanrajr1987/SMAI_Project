<p>The default installation of WSO2 IS 5.0.0 includes a web application STRATOS_ROOT and several config files in repository/conf/multitenancy which seem to be related to the old StratosLive stuff (Configuration options like paypal, google analytics, cloud services, <a href="https://cloud.wso2.com" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.wso2.com</a> ...)</p>  <p>My question is: Is it possible to get rid of these files for a simple single tenant installation?<br> I have deinstalled all stratos features, but CloudCommonServiceComponent still gets activated and loads the <em>cloud-services-desc.xml</em> and <em>multitenancy-packages.xml</em> configuration files.  When these files are removed exceptions in wso2carbon.log are thrown.</p>  <p>What is the recommended way to remove/disable the Stratos functionality in a WSO2 product?</p>
