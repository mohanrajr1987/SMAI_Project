<p>I am trying out WSO2 CEP for our new requirement. Currently i have written a query to find timedout events.</p>  <p>from InputStream#window.time(5 minutes) select * insert into TimeoutRequest for expired-events. </p>  <p>But my requirement is, the 5 minutes mentioned in time window will vary from each request. Some request should get timeout in 5 mins and some in 10 minutes. How to pass dynamic value for window.time(n minutes). If we can do via Custom Transformer or Custom Window, i am not getting the right context on how to do this. </p>
