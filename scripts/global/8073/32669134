<p>I have the following  requirement : “Copy a Zip file from a sftp server to a directory on a local server, then unzip the file and extract 2 Xml files from inside it to process in our message service we have setup within our ESB.”</p>  <p>I have done some several searches over the past week on the internet, as well as read several topics in the Wso2 documentation but I cannot find a clean way to implement this requirement. I found this question asked on stackoverflow already - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27806557/wso2-esb-extracting-and-processing-zip-files">WSO2 ESB Extracting and processing .zip files</a></p>  <p>However, I did not see where there were any suggestions/solutions provided. My first thought is to build a sequence with a class mediator to handle the extraction of the 2 xml files I need from the zip file, but maybe there is a better approach?</p>  <p>Is there any recommendations, links, or other references that folks could provide or suggest that would help me move forward with implementing this requirement? Or is this something I will need to handle outside of ESB via script with cron control?</p>
