<p>We are investigating the upgrade path for ESB 4.9.0.  This will be our first major upgrade for wso2 and we wanted to pull some information from the community about managing shared databases.</p>  <p>We run ESB, DSS and GREG that share a single registry Mysql DB, share a different single Mysql user db, and finally have independent Mysql local DBs.  The upgrade documentation from WSO2 provides upgrade scripts for the databases but I read the instructions as they are intended for a single, all-encompassing DB.  Should these scripts ONLY be run on the local DBs or should they somehow  be split across the other three DBs?  I am reading the ESB Upgrade Document from WSO2 - <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB490/Upgrading+from+the+Previous+Release" rel="nofollow">https://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB490/Upgrading+from+the+Previous+Release</a></p>  <p>Our environment is setup like - <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER420/Sharing+Databases" rel="nofollow">https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER420/Sharing+Databases</a></p>  <p>I am hoping this is a simple, easy answer and a lack of experience on my part.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Kevin</p>
