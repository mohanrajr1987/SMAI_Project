<p>I am new to WSO2 API Manager Product, which seems free (open source), I am refereeing to <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM170/Quick+Start+Guide" rel="nofollow">https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM170/Quick+Start+Guide</a> and specifically refereeing to "<strong>Adding interactive documentation using Swagger</strong>" Swagger API definition screen, but they have not given Swagger API definition itself. I am not able to developed anything outoff it later.</p>  <p>Could anyone please provide "Swagger API definition"? Please help.. This is only half Swagger API definition. I need full sample ..</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rRaz0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rRaz0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
