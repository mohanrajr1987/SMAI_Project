<p>I have recently built a proxy service in WSo2 ESB that was not fully implemented. When I saved it generated a fault service message and a link was provided to a faulty service group at the top of the ESB console. Since then, I have corrected the service and it has been transferring files as I have intended. However the service does not show in the initial list of services and I have to click on the link 7 deployed service group(s) to now view it in the proxy list. </p>  <p>Here is what the link looks like: <em>6 active services.  7 deployed service group(s). 1 faulty service(s).</em> </p>  <p>When I click on the 1 faulty service(s) I see the following but cannot delete it in an attempt to clear it.</p>  <pre><code>*Faulty Service     Actions RenZipExtractProxy proxy  Unable to configure the service RenZipExtractProxy for the VFS transport: Service doesn't have configuration information for transport vfs. This service is being marked as faulty and will not be available over the VFS transport.* </code></pre>  <p>How do I clear this faulty service issue? My updated service works fine but I continue to get the faulty service situation as stated above.</p>
