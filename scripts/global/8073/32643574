<p>I'm having trouble importing the right stuff in Eclipse so that I can patch some classes for WSO2 Identity Server 5.0.0.  With that said, what I need to do might be part of the underlying Carbon 4.2.0.  In particular I want to modify stuff in Identity for working with SAML, such as org.wso2.carbon.identity.sso.saml.logout.LogoutRequestSender and other related classes.</p>  <p>So I used the <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS500/Building+from+Source" rel="nofollow">Identity Server Build from Source</a> instructions and was able to build patches and the IS distribution from the command-line with maven.  But I'm at a loss how much or how little to import into Eclipse to do any coding work.  It seems I get an overload of projects in and tons of errors.  I'm totally at a loss how to work with such an explosion of interrelated projects like this.</p>  <p>For starters, I have exported <a href="https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/carbon/platform/tags/turing-chunk11/" rel="nofollow">https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/carbon/platform/tags/turing-chunk11/</a></p>  <p>So I did a search from where the class that I want to start my work, LogoutRequestSender, is located.  It's in a few places...</p>  <p>turing-chunk11/components/identity/org.wso2.carbon.identity.sso.saml/4.2.1/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/identity/sso/saml/logout/LogoutRequestSender.java</p>  <p>turing-chunk11/components/identity/org.wso2.carbon.identity.sso.saml/4.2.2/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/identity/sso/saml/logout/LogoutRequestSender.java</p>  <p>turing-chunk11/components/identity/org.wso2.carbon.identity.sso.saml/4.2.0/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/identity/sso/saml/logout/LogoutRequestSender.java</p>  <p>So, do I really only want to import into eclipse this guy? turing-chunk11/components/identity/org.wso2.carbon.identity.sso.saml/4.2.0</p>  <p>Not sure why all these versions are under this chunk.  So confusing!  </p>  <p>Would someone be willing to explain how I can get up and running and make better sense of this?  I would love to contribute! (and fix some things ahead of the release schedule!)</p>  <p>Along with that, if I get that part right, how do I build and set the right things so that IS takes it as a patch?</p>
