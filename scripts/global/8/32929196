<p>Messing around with an embedded microcontroller, I've noticed that when I set up a buffer:<code>char buffer[100]</code> and then print to it: <code>snprintf(buffer, 20, "Just A test");</code>, my memory map shows that not just the bytes I expected are changed. </p>  <p>As a result, unintended variables seem to get affected. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>EDIT: okay I took a screenshot of the situation. The memory map in black has just been init'd to all FF's. However after the sprintf prints to the buffer, it produces the expected changes as well as the not expected (not expected highlighted in the red box and also in red underneath that box. I'm more concerned about the red box because it's seemingly overwriting some of my intended changes)</p>  <p>Stack overflow wont let me upload images due to no reputation.

I think I have a version of this problem: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22295028/sprintf-corrupting-arrays-in-iar-microcontroller">sprintf corrupting arrays in IAR microcontroller</a> </p>
