<p>I made the following little program:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  void strncpy(char * s, char * t, int n);  int main() {     char string1[]="Learning strings";     char string2[10];     strncpy(string2,string1,3);     printf("string1:%s\nstring2:%s\n",string1,string2);     return 0; }  void strncpy(char * s, char * t, int n) {     int i;     for(i=0; i&lt;n &amp;&amp; t[i]!=0;i++)         s[i]=t[i];     s[i]=0; } </code></pre>  <p>I was trying to learn the difference between doing something like:</p>  <pre><code>char greeting[]="Hello!"; </code></pre>  <p>And </p>  <pre><code>char * farewell="Goodbye!"; </code></pre>  <p>And I thought my program would work with either of the two types of 'strings'(correct way of saying it?), but it only works with the first one.</p>  <p>Why does this happen? What's the difference between the two types?</p>  <p>What would I have to do to my program to be able to use strings of the second type?</p>
