<p>Hey I am stuck to find a logic to print this pattern. I tried a lot but can't find any way.</p>  <p>My Problem is:</p>  <p>I have an array which contains some random integers and based on that I have to print stars(*) in vertically format.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>array = [2,3,5,2,6]; </code></pre>  <p>Then the pattern will be:</p>  <pre><code>    *   * *       * *  ** * *****    ***** </code></pre>
