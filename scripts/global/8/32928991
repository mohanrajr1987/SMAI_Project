<p>I have installed Cygwin on my pc and I am trying to compile the scripts I write through NppExec. This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>NPP_SAVE  NPP_CONSOLE 1 cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)" C:\Cygwin\bin\gcc.exe "$(FILE_NAME)" -o "$(NAME_PART)" </code></pre>  <p>When I run the script I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>C:/Cygwin/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-cygwin/4.9.3/cc1.exe: error while loading shared libraries: ?: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>Also, if I manually run cc1.exe from windows it says cygcloog-isl-4.dll is missing.(and I am pretty sure it was a different dll another time I tried)</p>  <p>The strange part is I open the Cygwin terminal, navigate to the same directory, enter "gcc hello.c -o hello" and it finishes without errors, compiling the script like it should. Maybe the gcc command in the terminal corresponds to another executable that runs without problem? Any help would be appreciated..</p>
