<p>I am trying to encode German characters in html. I just want to use the special character codes. For the Umlaut, I've tried using both <code>&amp;Uuml;</code> and <code>&amp;#220;</code> and neither renders properly. What am I doing wrong? Thanks.  </p>  <p>This is for a Squarespace site, and I am inserting Javascript into their Code Injection page, into the footer.  I am using Javascript to write a German word on the page.  The relevant part of my code looks like the below.  And the problem is that this simply renders "&amp; U uml;ber' (space added by me because the umlaut renders properly on Stack Overflow without it) on the page rather than Uber with an umlaut.  Thanks!</p>  <pre><code> var strings = {           'About': {             'de': '&amp;Uuml;ber'           }, </code></pre>
