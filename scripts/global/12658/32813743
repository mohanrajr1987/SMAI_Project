<p>Viewing an html file through Google Chrome version 42.0.2311.90 being edited through Notepad++ version 6.7.9.2 through Citrix Reciever (client software that allows universal access to virtual applications and desktops). I'm putting in text near the end, where a copyright symbol would be, but when I view it in the browser, to the left of the © is this funky Â character. In the encoding drop-down menu in Notepad++, it says the encoding is set to "Encode in UTF-8 without BOM". Below is all my coding concerning the text:</p>  <p>HTML:</p>  <p><code>&lt;body&gt;     &lt;div id="end"&gt;         &lt;p id="en"&gt;© Charity Checker&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</code></p>  <p>(CSS portion is having horrible errors so I wont post it. Sorry.)</p>
