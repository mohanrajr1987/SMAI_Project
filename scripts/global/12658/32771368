<p>Rackspace upgraded their servers to php 5.6/apache 2.4 and ever since then, I have had several sites show these strange characters.  I have gone all through google to apply patches/fixes but absolutely nothing is working.  Here is an example of one:  believerschallenge.com/index.php</p>  <p>Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!</p>
