<p>My boss likes to use n-dashes. They always cause problems with encoding and I cannot work out why.</p>  <p>I store my TEXT field in a database under the charset: <code>utf8_general_ci</code>.</p>  <p>I have the following tags under my <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on my webpage:</p>  <p><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;</code></p>  <p>I pull the information from my database with the following set: <code>mysql_set_charset('UTF8',$connection);</code></p>  <p>(I know MYSQL is depreciated)</p>  <p>But when I get information from the database, I end up with this: <code>Ã¢Â€Â“ Europe</code></p>  <p>If I take this string and run it through <code>utf8_decode</code>, I get this: <code>â�?�? Europe</code></p>  <p>I even tried running it thorugh utf8_encode, and I got this: <code>ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ Europe</code></p>  <p>Can someone explain to me why this is happening? I dont understand.  I even ran the string through <code>mb_detect_encoding</code> and It said the string was utf8.  So why is not printing correctly?</p>  <p>The solution (or not really a solution, because it ruins the rest of the website) is to remove the <code>mysql_set_encoding</code> line, and use <code>utf8_decode</code>.  Then it prints out fine.  BUT WHY!?</p>
