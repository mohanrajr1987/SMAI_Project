<p>I am trying to create a file from Oracle PL/SQL with should have encoding ISO 8859-1 But by default a file is created with UTF-8 encoding which is not desired.</p>  <p>Can you please let me know how we can set the encoding of the file using pl/sql </p>  <p>Database NLS_CHARACTERSET 'WE8ISO8859P1'</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Using the below code to create file </p>  <pre><code>declare   file utl_file.file_type;   l_str varchar2(20);   begin   select val into l_str from temp where rownum=1;   file := utl_file.fopen('D_OUT', 'dummy.psv', 'w', 32767);   utl_file.put_line(file,l_str);   utl_file.fclose(file); end; /   </code></pre>  <p>The dummy.psv file format in NOTEPAD++ is ANSI as UTF-8 and in unix its ANSI. I have asked my unix developer to convert the file to ISO 8859-1 ,but the real question is why the file with desired encoding is not created. </p>
