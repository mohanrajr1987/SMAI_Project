<p>I've created a scraper to collect some data from an website. This scraper I run from the cli and show's the output to me. As I have results with special characters such as 'ë' it goes wrong at the insert.</p>  <p>In my console I do see the character 'ë' but when I check my database table (latin1_sweden_ci) it produces 'Ã«' where I want to keep the 'ë'. I make use of msqli.</p>  <pre><code># Connect with database $mysqli = new mysqli('localhost', 'xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxx'); if ($mysqli-&gt;connect_errno) {     printf('Connect failed: %s\n', $mysqli-&gt;connect_error);     exit; }  $sTitle = $oTitle-&gt;plaintext; //....  $mysqli-&gt;query("INSERT INTO table_name (title, slug, text, cat_id) VALUES ('$sTitle', '$sSlug', '$sText', '" . $iId . "')"); </code></pre>
