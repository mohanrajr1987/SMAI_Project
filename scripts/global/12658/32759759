<p>I have an asp.net web site running on .net 4.0.</p>  <p>The database is Firebird 2.1 and it is UTF-8.</p>  <p>When a user enters the text <strong>O’Connell</strong> and saves it, when it is displayed on the web page it shows as <strong>O�Connell</strong> instead. The right quotation character is achieved by doing alt-0146.</p>  <p>I know this is something to do with character encoding. I have done the following.</p>  <p>1) Added <code>&lt;globalization culture="en-GB" uiCulture="en-GB" requestEncoding="utf-8" responseEncoding="utf-8" fileEncoding="utf-8" /&gt;</code> into the web.config file.</p>  <p>2) Added <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;</code> into the master page file.</p>  <p>3) Ensured that all files on in the solution are encoded as 'UTF-8'.</p>  <p>4) Made sure I am connecting to the database with <code>character set=UTF8;</code> in the connection string.</p>  <p>I am at a loss to find out what the problem is?</p>  <p>Regards</p>
