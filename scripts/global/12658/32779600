<p>I have a problem with gSOAP C++.  I want to read some records from a postgres database. For that I set the client_encoding to UTF-8.</p>  <p>In the sent.log of gSOAP I have those characters:</p>  <p>Ã¼berstr.  or  Ã¶de (First should be a "ü" and the second one a "ö").</p>  <p>If I set the client_encoding during the database selection to "LATIN1", the request is correct.</p>  <p>What should I do to send the UTF-8 Data correctly?</p>
