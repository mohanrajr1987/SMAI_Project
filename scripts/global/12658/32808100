<p>I have some Chinese words in a subtitle file with UTF-8 encoding:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>踏上坚实的土地</p> </blockquote>  <p>I joined 10 subtitle files(*.srt) with <a href="http://subworkshop.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Subtitle Workshop</a>, the output encoding became ANSI, and I can't find any settings to change the output encoding. The output file is like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>韪忎笂鍧氬疄鐨勫湡鍦?</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'd tried using <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CBwQFjAAahUKEwjDyvXmnpfIAhWCVo4KHQtKDNA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fcp-converter%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHivafZyJf0GXTnqowquU_eyytpJg&amp;sig2=wUqTAdoZOGmFQlyLLLU_Qg" rel="nofollow">Code page converter</a> to convert from ANSI to Unicode. The reason I convert to Unicode instead of UTF-8 is because the Movie Maker doesn't read Chinese characters in UTF-8 encoding, it will display a bunch of gibberish.<br><br> So, could it be possible to convert from ANSI back to UTF-8/Unicode and reappear the Chinese words? If you know where to change the settings, tell me. I using join subtitles potion by the way.</p>
