<p>I have a HTML 5 page with this in the header:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>On the same page I make an Ajax request with Jquery in this way:</p>  <pre><code>$.ajax({         url: "ajax/subscribe.php",         type: "POST",         encoding: "UTF-8",         data: formData,... </code></pre>  <p>All works fine, in ajax/subscribe.php I have this header:</p>  <pre><code>header('Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8'); </code></pre>  <p>And My MySQL-database had a default charset of utf8_unicode_ci. But... When I process a word like this 'égallement', it is saved in database as 'gallement', the é is stripped. There is also send an email automatically, and in this email the 'é' is replaced by a question mark. Anny suggestions to solve this problem?</p>
