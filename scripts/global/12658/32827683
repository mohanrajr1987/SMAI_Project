<p>Using <code>fromJSON()</code> on a UTF-8 JSON object results in the following error message: </p>  <pre><code>Error in parse_string(txt, bigint_as_char) :    lexical error: invalid character inside string.           iohead + “Single Ladiep�'HH]8�&amp;���Y^HH\n�                      (right here) ------^ </code></pre>  <p>Which seems to be caused by the character � and the maybe the single quote "'" </p>  <p>How can I convert this character and the like into standard UTF-8 format?</p>
