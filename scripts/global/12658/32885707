<p>I have a txt file of a WhatsApp chat and I want to parse it using Java.</p>  <p>But all emojis used is displayed as "â€¬ðŸ˜‚" in the txt file. I wanted to try and findout how to learn which emoji is actually used and tried this:</p>  <pre><code>â€¬System.out.print( "\\u" + Integer.toHexString(line.charAt(i) | 0x10000).substring(1) ); </code></pre>  <p>But it displays a wrong unicode such as \ud83d etc.</p>  <p>I also got this list but I don't know exactly how to use it: <a href="http://grumdrig.com/emoji-list/#" rel="nofollow">http://grumdrig.com/emoji-list/#</a></p>
