<p>I am trying to understand closures, already read some materials but.. then i tried this. </p>  <p>As far as i understand, a class is generated containing the specific anonymous method (in my case, the one writing to the console) and the int variable j. How does it store all the j values in only one class? Are there many instances of this kind of class generated behind the scenes?</p>  <pre><code>class Program {     public static List&lt;Action&gt; actions = new List&lt;Action&gt;();      static void Main(string[] args)     {         AddActions(10);          actions[0]();          actions[1]();          Console.ReadLine();     }      public static void AddActions(int count)     {         for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)         {             int j = i;             actions.Add(delegate()             {                 Console.Write("{0} ", j);             });         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>with result:  0 1</p>
