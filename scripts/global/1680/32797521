<p>In this code:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; python &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(2): ...     def printer(): ...          print i ...     a.append(printer) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; a [&lt;function printer at 0x01EDE330&gt;, &lt;function printer at 0x01EDE2F0&gt;] &gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]() 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; a[1]() 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] == a[1] False </code></pre>  <p>it appears that I made two different functions, and stored them in the array <code>a[]</code>.</p>  <p>I don't understand why the functions appear to be different, but the result of each function is not.   I would have thought either the functions would be the same (IE the second iteration would redefine the one from the first), or the functions would be different <strong>and</strong> the result would be different (0 and 1 respectively).</p>  <p>I hoping for and expecting the latter...</p>
