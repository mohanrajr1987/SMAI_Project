<p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>import Cocoa  class VC1: NSViewController {     let aFunctionVar ()-&gt;Void } </code></pre>  <p>The compiler however tells me: "Class VC1 has no initializers"</p>  <p>According to the swift example in Apple Swift iBook, they did their examplle like so: </p>  <pre><code>var mathFunction: (Int, Int) -&gt; Int = addTwoInts </code></pre>  <p>But in my case, I'm trying to create a property variable. It is not yet known what the variable will be, so i can't set it there. Any help?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> - I already know how to make variables optional and lazy when it comes to simple String/Array/Dictionary types etc. But this is a function type property variable. It is meant to hold a function of type <code>()-&gt;Void</code>.  Any help on how this can be done?</p>  <p>In objectiveC this can be done by making a block property like this:</p>  <pre><code>@property (nonatomic, copy)  void (^aFunctionVar)(); </code></pre>
