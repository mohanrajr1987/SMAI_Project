<p>I would like to create an array of div using closures. The code I have is:</p>  <pre><code>function addLinks () {     for (var i=0, link; i&lt;288; i++) {         link = document.createElement("a");         link.innerHTML = "Link " + i;         link.onclick = function (num) {             return function () {                 alert(num);             };         }(i);         $(".icon0").append(link);     } } addLinks(); </code></pre>  <p>This works great but I want to use this on my divs with the class of icon and return the values of each of it's src attributes. The divs:</p>  <pre><code>$(".tdata0").append("&lt;div class = 'icon0 icons' src='Applications/AnosStore/AnosStore.html' data-iconFile='Applications/AnosStore/AnosStore.png' data-title='Anos Store'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"); $(".tdata1").append("&lt;div class = 'icon2 icons' src='Applications/Settings.app' data-iconFile='Applications/Settings.app/' data-title='Anos Editor'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"); </code></pre>  <p>But the code i have obviously creates <strong>links</strong> and it alerts which one you clicked based on its numbers in stead how would i get it to work using document.getElementsByClassName() and using getAttribute("src") and alerting the src every time  an icon div is clicked? any ideas, I'm really stuck and have been trying to get this problem working in my spare time for my whole summer holidays and now I'm in 3rd year and don't have time to research it myself. Oh also, each div is <code>.icon0</code>, <code>.icon1</code> and so on and so on all the way up to <code>.icon287</code> even though only 2 currently exist on the page more will be added once this works.</p>
