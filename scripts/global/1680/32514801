<p>I am new to PHP and currently learning the concept of closure. </p>  <p>For closure using use() I know that I can do the following: </p>  <pre><code>$y = "hello";  $c = function() use ($y) {     return $y;  };   print_r($c()); // prints out 'hello' echo '&lt;br /&gt;';  </code></pre>  <p>However, I have problem on doing a function that returns another anonymous function, for example: </p>  <pre><code>$u = function() {     return function () use ($y) {         return $y;      };  };   print_r($u()); // empty closure object... echo '&lt;br /&gt;';  </code></pre>  <p>I know that when I modify the above codes to the below one, then the code works perfectly. BUT I do NOT understand the reason why. Hope someone can explain it to me. Thanks. </p>  <pre><code>$b = function() use ($y) {     return function () use ($y) {         return $y;      }; };   print_r($b()); // output :  [y] =&gt; hello echo'&lt;br /&gt;';  </code></pre>  <p>In a similar way, I have a question on the below code using global, why it does not work: </p>  <pre><code>$k = function() {     return function() {         global $y;          return $y;      };  };   print_r($k()); // prints out 'Closure Object ( )' echo '&lt;br /&gt;';  </code></pre>  <p>Please do NOT tell me how to swap the codes to make it work. As I have tried, and I know how to change and make these codes work. Instead, I would like to know why global and use() does NOT work when I call them in the return of another anonymous function. </p>  <p>Thanks for helping me to clarify the idea on how use / global works. </p>
