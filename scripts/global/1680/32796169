<p>I wrote a custom Polymer element that lets the user pick a month. You can look view the code at <a href="https://github.com/HoverBaum/month-picker" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/HoverBaum/month-picker</a></p>  <p>No I want to use this to select a range of dates. So the user should select a start and and end.<br> I added two of my  elements to a page, to try this out. However for some reason I can only change the selection of the second element. This looks like the two are somehow interfering with each other. Usually I would say "of cause they use the same ids etc." but I was thinking Polymer would take care of these things.</p>  <p>Here is my little demo page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="timespan"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Start &lt;month-picker&gt;&lt;/month-picker&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;End &lt;month-picker&gt;&lt;/month-picker&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The way the  works is that it shows the selected date and when you click it a dialog is opened that lets you change the selected month. But for some reason both element only open the dialog for the second .</p>
