<p>I have an array of Custom objects and I would like to convert them in an array of Other Custom Objects....</p>  <p>Can I do it with map closure?</p>  <p>I tried like so:</p>  <pre><code>items.map( { (cutom: Custom1) -&gt; Custom2 in                 Custom2(title: custom.name, locationName: custom.placeName))             }) </code></pre>  <p>But without result...the compiler gives me the following error: _?? is not convertible to 'Array'</p>  <p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
