<p>I have a closure, and from that closure, I need to access the <code>arguments</code> object literal of the function in which the closure is defined:</p>  <pre><code>function outerFunction(){      var myClosure = function(){         // I need to access the "arguments" object of "outerFunction"     }  } </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible without storing <code>arguments</code> in a variable? </p>
