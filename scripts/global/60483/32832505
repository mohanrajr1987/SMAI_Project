<p>I need to load different CSS stylesheet for mobile phones, but not for tablets. I was using the following solutions in the past:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt; &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=480"&gt; &lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (max-width: 480px)"href="mobile.css" /&gt; &lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (min-width: 481px)" href="desktop.css" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>or: </p>  <pre><code>@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) { } </code></pre>  <p>but both are based on screen resolutions. The most of today's mobile phones use higher resolutions so it won't work as I want and here is the reason: Tablets will also be affected by this part:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=480"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And I want tablets to act like desktops / laptops.</p>  <p>Also, I was trying to do it this way:</p>  <pre><code>var IS_IPHONE = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) != null; var IS_ANDROID = navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)  != null;  if(IS_IPHONE)    ({       url: href,       dataType: 'css',       success: function(){                               $('&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="'+css/iphone.css+'" /&gt;').appendTo("head");         } });  if(IS_ANDROID)    ({       url: href,       dataType: 'css',       success: function(){                               $('&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="'+css/android.css+'" /&gt;').appendTo("head");         } }); </code></pre>  <p>but there are so many different phones nowadays, that I can't search for every possible device and add it once a while.  Besides, Androids are also tablets nowadays.</p>  <p>Is there any GENERIC code which detects smartphones (not tablets, just phones)? I guess it can't be based on media queries.</p>  <p>I was trying to find a solution based on current posts, but there wasn't clear answer on my question, so I've posted it here.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
