<p>I'm pretty new to web development and lately I have been playing around with media queries to optimise my web page when scaled down on various resolutions.</p>  <p>I use the responsive design view in Mozilla Firefox to test my website at different screen sizes but I am having a problem when actually coming to view on a mobile device.</p>  <p>As you can see by the two picture I have attached, when viewing on Mozilla Firefox on the same resolution as my phone (for testing) the display looks a lot larger e.g. the font-size seems to be larger than what it actually is when I view the page on my mobile device.</p>  <p>I've tried researching into how to optimise this without having to create seperate CCS sheets for various displays and would appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Sam. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SG0ke.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SG0ke.png" alt="Mozilla Firefox view"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VcfmX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VcfmX.png" alt="Mobile view"></a></p>  <p>Image 1 : Firefox responsive design view <br>  Image 2 : Mobile view </p>
