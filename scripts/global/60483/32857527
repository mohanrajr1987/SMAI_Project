<p>I am working on a Jquery Mobile application, and I am facing an issue. But first a bit of background: I am working with several pages in one html file.</p>  <p>here is my issue: I go from page1 to page2 using a button with href="#page2". In page2, I get a JSon object to populate a listview. When I select some items from this listview viewlist, the background color of the  &lt; l i >changes color. By selecting a line I can get the id and name of the selected Json object, and I sasve those infromation in an array.  Then I click on a button that sends me back to page1 using onclick="parent.history.back()".</p>  <p>On page1 I can display in a textfield the names and ids previously saved from the listview in page2.</p>  <p>Now comes the trouble if I try following scenario: User forgot to select one item in page2, he clicks on the buttton to go to page#2 again. </p>  <p>This is what happens when I click on the button with href"page2": pagebeforeshow event is triggered, then page#2 is visible afainI can see in my populated listview with the previously selected items.  Then pageshow event is triggered and still I can see that my items are selected. Then my page 'refreshes' and my selected items are not selected anymore!</p>  <p>i tried to 'force' a manual select on events pagebeforeshow, or pageshow, or when I populate my listview. but it didn't help. I added catching events for all events listed there <a href="http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/api/events.html" rel="nofollow">http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/api/events.html</a>, but none of them are fired after pageshow.</p>  <p>I am trying to understand what is happening and why it is not working. So my questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Why is my page 'refreshed' after a pageshow event?</li> <li>How can I prevent this 'refresh'?</li> <li>What kind of event can I catch after the refresh to dynamically select my previously selected items</li> </ol>  <p>Sorry for the long post, and thanks for reading and helping.</p>  <p>Bonododo</p>
