<p>I can't figure out how to fix this error, everytime I test my app on Google Chrome this error occurs, but the app works well in Firefox. What should I do to fix this?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to execute 'replaceState' on 'History': A history state object with URL 'file:///C:/Users/User/Desktop/finalproject/index.html' cannot be created in a document with origin 'null'.</p> </blockquote>
