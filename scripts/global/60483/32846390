<p>I need to loop through a div and get the dates from all input fields inside the div. Input fields are Jquery Mobile DateBox input fields.</p>  <p>I am cloning a div containing Jquery Mobile DateBox input field and appending to another main div. The same may happen multiple times based on the need. After setting dates in the fields, I am searching for way to get the set date in the Jquery Mobile DateBox input field.</p>  <p>My input field is,</p>          <p>I cloned and enhanced in the following way,</p>  <pre><code>var dayTimePicker = $("#time-picker-template").clone()  $("#time-picker-block").append(dayTimePicker).enhanceWithin(); </code></pre>  <p>I didn't gave ID to the input field since I will be cloning and reusing the same multiple times.</p>  <p>I want to get the time/date which is set in the field. I tried looping the div but failed to do. My trials are,</p>  <pre><code>var dayDiv = $("#time-picker-block");      $(dayDiv).find('input:text').each(function() {      alert($(this).val());  });  $('#time-picker-block').children('input').each(function () {      alert(this.value); // "this" is the current element in the loop  });  $('#time-picker-block').each(function (index, element) {      $(element).datebox('getTheDate');  }); </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone help me out to resolve this issue for me.</p>
