<p>I am currently trying to update my mobile HTML5 app to the newest Nativedroid version (Nativedroid 2) and encountered a problem:</p>  <p>On my app I have a permanent header and footer over many pages. I made this work with this code:</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;div id="header" data-role="header" data-tap-toggle="false" data-theme="b" data-position="fixed" data-id="main-header"&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div id="footer" data-role="footer" data-tap-toggle="false" data-theme="b" data-id="main-footer" data-position="fixed"&gt;    &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>With NativeDroid2 this seems to be not working correctly anymore. When I try this code with the new NativeDroid upon changing the page header and footer are shown without CSS (at least it seems like that) for a short time.</p>  <p>Anyone has a idea how I could make it work again?</p>
