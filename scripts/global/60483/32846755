<p>I have a jquery mobile (v1.2) page which is online since 3 years. Everything works fine, except in iOS 9 Safari, I have a problem with scrolling of pages.</p>  <p>I don't know, how to explain the problem exactly, but if you post a form, the result page appears, but you can't scroll down, and only a white space is rendered. Have a look at the screenshot.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3DHld.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3DHld.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If you reload the page, everything is fine again and you can scroll down. If you want to see/test it yourself: <a href="http://urlgone.com/f0a05f/" rel="nofollow">http://urlgone.com/f0a05f/</a></p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
