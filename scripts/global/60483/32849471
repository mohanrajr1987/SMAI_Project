<p>I'm using Cordova 5.1.1 and building for Android. I've built a simple application that works great when compiled within the cordova project. Now I'm trying to load the pages externally so that I have more control over the content.</p>  <p>I've added InAppBrowser and the pages load from within my app. The problem is that the page elements are not loading like jQuery Mobile pages but instead without any formatting whatsoever. </p>  <p><strong>How can I load my application like it's intended to while keeping the content external?</strong></p>
