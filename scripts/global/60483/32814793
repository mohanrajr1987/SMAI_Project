<p>In fancytree table, a checkbox rendered with data-role as 'flipswitch' is displayed only as a normal checkbox. Same control when used outside the fancytree table displays as desired.</p>  <p>As this is my first post, I am unable to insert a pictures that would have explained the issue in a clear manner. Please refer to the link <a href="http://automationhome.in/img/fancytree-jquerymobile.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Outside fancytree (on top), the flip switch is displayed correctly and inside fancytree, against item DO|On/Off it is displayed as a normal checkbox. A slider has also been added and note differences in how the control is rendered outside and inside fancytree table.</p>  <p>Javascript code used to render the fancytree column is also given below. </p>  <pre><code>renderColumns: function(event, data) {   var node = data.node;   $tdList = $(node.tr).find("&gt;td");   $tdList.eq(1).html(        "&lt;input type='checkbox' data-role='flipswitch' name='switch' id='switch'&gt;" ); } </code></pre>  <p>What should I do to make fancy tree display the switch correctly? Your help is appreciated.</p>  <p>This is my first post to the forum. Forgive me for any mistake and let me know if I have not followed any protocol correctly.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
