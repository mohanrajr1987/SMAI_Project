<p>I started my scheduling app with a basic app template for my app, it worked pretty well. Initially, it was only for IVR, now it started to add multiple channels (ivr, web, sms, etc). Each channel handles the user request differently and communicates the request in the requested channel, but all it does is scheduling. So, I started off with the following structure,</p>  <pre><code>backend common frontend     modules         ivr         web         appt </code></pre>  <p>For me, appt is going to be the core module and will be used by all channel modules. ivr and web modules handles request from different channels. If someone requests for appt, how can I pass the request data to appt module and send the appt's response back to user?</p>  <p>If it is an app without modules, it would be an instantiation of model and assigning form collected values to model, validate them, save and send the response in the request synchronously. How I can do the same, if my module depends on another module to perform validation and other business logic?</p>  <p>Can anyone shed some light on my approach? Should I go with module and just go back with the plain single app structure?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>My main confusion is whether IVR should go as a module or it should go as separate app as backend, frontend &amp; console app does with Yii2 advanced template. The other modules that I'm considering are subscribe, script, notifier. Some modules are common to all channels and some others are specific to IVR. </p>  <p>When I considered 'appointment (appt)' as module and attempted to make appt from web module, I got stuck at how to instantiate models &amp; retrieve error message.</p>  <p>I think modules should be loosed coupled, but for me, it appears to tightly integrated with other modules. What do you suggest from the following?</p>  <ol> <li><p>every purpose / feature as module and should be able to handle requests / response for all channels (ivr, web, etc)</p></li> <li><p>every channel should be projected as module and should interact with feature modules. Does this over complate the module system?</p></li> <li><p>Bring IVR as a separate app and import the necessary modules in it and add modules as needed?</p></li> </ol>
