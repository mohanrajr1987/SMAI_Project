<p>There is one method. In one case I need to return variable with one type. In another case I need  to return variable with another type. I created two methods. But I know that it is not a good idea because of dublication of code. Any idea how to fix it and use one method?</p>  <pre><code>public ClassA doSomething(String aString, String bString, String cString, String dString) {     ClassA client;     ClientFactory clientFactory = new ClientFactoryImpl();     client = clientFactory.createNewClient(aString, bString);     ClassB conn = clientFactory.connect(cString, dString);     return client; }  public ClassB doSomething(String aString, String bString, String cString, String dString) {     ClassA client;     ClientFactory clientFactory = new ClientFactoryImpl();     client = clientFactory.createNewClient(aString, bString);     ClassB conn = clientFactory.connect(cString, dString);     return conn; } </code></pre>
