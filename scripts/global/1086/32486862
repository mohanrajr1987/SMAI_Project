<p>I have this stored procedure:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[InsertStuff]     @RequestId int AS BEGIN     SET NOCOUNT ON      INSERT INTO [dbo].[MyTable] ([Id], [Column2], [AnotherColumn])     VALUES         ((SELECT Id FROM [dbo].[MyTable] WHERE Id = @RequestId)         ,(SELECT Column2 FROM [dbo].[MyTable] WHERE Id = @RequestId)         ,(SELECT AgreementTypeId FROM [dbo].[MyTable] WHERE Id = @RequestId)) END </code></pre>  <p>How can I modify it so I am not doing all these select statements... which is horrible for performance let along just terrible design. I am assuming I can use a temp table but I'd like to see it spelled out for me on where and how I would do this in a stored procedure. Thanks.</p>
