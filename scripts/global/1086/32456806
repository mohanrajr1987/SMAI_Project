<p>During changing business logic we need to refactor the code and the unit-tests. In sources in Jasmine recomending to use x-blockes (such as xdescribe or xit) or function pending() to skip obsolete tests. Say me how is it right:</p>  <ul> <li>use recomended methods (above)?</li> <li>remove obsolete blocks describe(it)?</li> </ul>  <p>What are the advantages / disadvantages of the first and second approach?</p>
