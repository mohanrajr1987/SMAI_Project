<p>All the code review tools I found focuses on diffs, i.e. they display diffs between two commits and allow commenting on those.</p>  <p>While this is great and useful for continuous integration, sometime we need to organize code review on full code without any concern for the diffs that led to it (typically, a senior want to evaluate if refactor should be done, therefore he/she is interested in the whole structure. Some may rightfully point out this is not code review anymore, but well, not my point).</p>  <p>I have been hunting for such a tool, but with no success. We have crucible and gitlab, but they do not propose this feature. Now we do this by email, and that is getting old.</p>  <p>Any advice ? (integration with git a super big plus)</p>
