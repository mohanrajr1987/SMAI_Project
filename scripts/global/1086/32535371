<p>I am trying to refactor my code to look cleaner. Right now I have this <em>bad</em> code:</p>  <pre><code>@member = Member.new  @member.build_local_board @member.build_prospective @member.build_alumni @member.build_board @member.build_job @member.build_academic @member.build_special_role @member.build_conferences_member  @prospective = Prospective.new @alumni = Alumni.new @board = Board.new @user = User.new @job = Job.new @academic = Academic.new </code></pre>  <p>And I was trying to make it similar to this:</p>  <pre><code>models = %w(local_board, prospective, alumni, board, [...]) fields = [models] fields.each do |f|   @f = f.new   @member.build_f end </code></pre>  <p>But I think I am missing some <strong><em>Ruby syntax</em></strong>, because I get this error:</p>  <p><code>undefined method 'new' for ["local_board,", "prospective"]:Array</code></p>  <p>It seems really simple. That's the problem when you first learn the framework and not the core language.</p>  <p>I thank you in advance.</p>
