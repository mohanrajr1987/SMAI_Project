<p>I want to check if <strong><code>a</code></strong> is equal to a value, and <strong><code>b</code></strong> is equal to another, or vice versa</p>  <p>For example</p>  <pre><code>(a == 3 &amp;&amp; b == 5) || (a == 5 &amp;&amp; b == 3) </code></pre>  <p>I know if it was <code>boolean</code> variables, I could just XOR them. How can I achieve the same function when checking for two values?</p>
