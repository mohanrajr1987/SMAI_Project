<p>We are dropping a huge part of the code. But we need to keep all that comes from an start point.</p>  <pre><code>Ex:   RestFacade         import Service                    import DAO                        import ... </code></pre>  <p>There is a tool that goes through every class and get the name of its imports? I would like to get something like this:</p>  <pre><code>Must Keep:     pkg.RestFacade     pkg.service.ServiceX     pkg.dao.DAOY     pkg.entity.Address     pkg.entity.address.xxx; </code></pre>
