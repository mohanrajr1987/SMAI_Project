<p>I saw this in a code review:</p>  <pre><code>public void deleteCompany() {     ...     deleteUser(userId); } </code></pre>  <p>and immediately thought "Oh this is wrong, it's not supposed to be deleted just like that, you have to check if the user is referenced other places, and only then delete the user if it isnt". I checked the deleteUser function and found this:</p>  <pre><code>private void deleteUser(String userId) {     if(getUserReferences(userId) &lt;= 1) {         deleteUser(userId);     } } </code></pre>  <p>I suggested to either rename the function to something like:</p>  <pre><code>deleteUserIfNotReferencedElsewhere(userId); </code></pre>  <p>or, to remove the private function(which was used only once) altogether, and just place those 3 lines of code "inline".</p>  <p><strong>Some questions to this:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Do you think me pointing out such things are too trivial or too "fine grained" for a code-review? Should I give the guy a break?</li> <li>Do you think it's correct to suggest what I did? Or is it really fine, since it's "just a private function"?</li> </ol>
