<p>I've been using eclipse until recently for java. I'm starting out with a embedded c project and there seems to be a lot of functionality missing in IAR Embedded Workbench IDE. I don't want to switch as projects I'm working on are made for this IDE and migrating would be quite a hassle. </p>  <p>Is there a way to enable refactoring and clicking to find declarations of variables etc. ?</p>
