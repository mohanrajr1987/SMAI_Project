<p>How to refactor this snippet of code, to reduce indentation level by one? I just wonder is it possible in PHP to write this code in a diffrent way, with just one level of indentation.</p>  <p>The code:</p>  <pre><code>private function isArrayMatchingCriteria(array $array) {     foreach($array as $element) {         if (! $this-&gt;isElementMatchingCriteria($element) {             return false;         }     }     return true; } </code></pre>  <p>Please take into consideration, that:</p>  <ul> <li>this code doesn't always iterate over all array elements - so combination of count + array_filter / array_map isn't the same</li> <li>it is easy to do by introducing a dedicated object attribute serving as a flag, but I'm looking for a way without introducing new attributes</li> </ul>
