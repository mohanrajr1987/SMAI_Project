<p>I've got an array, called $data which needs to be updated with data from an ajax call.</p>  <p>There are two variables sent via an ajax call (with example inputs):</p>  <p><strong>sectionDetails</strong>: </p>  <pre><code>[111][0][2][0][service_providers][] </code></pre>  <p><strong>serviceProvider</strong>: </p>  <pre><code>Google </code></pre>  <p>The serviceProvider is the data, and the sectionDetails is the array in which the serviceProvider should be in, in the $data array.</p>  <p>What I need is the $data array to end up as:</p>  <pre><code>$data  =   Array ( [111] =&gt; Array     (         [0] =&gt; Array             (                 [2] =&gt; Array                     (                         [0] =&gt; Array                             (                                 [service_providers] =&gt; Array                                                      (                                                         [0] = Google                                                     )                             )                      )              )      )  ) </code></pre>  <p>This way, I can dynamically input data into any cell and then later I can update specific arrays (e.g. <code>$data[111][0][2][0][service_providers][0]</code> = <code>"Yahoo"</code>;</p>  <p>The <code>$_POST['sectionDetails']</code> is however a string which is where the issue is.</p>  <p>Is there a way to change this string to an array that can then be appended to the main $data array (and in the case of an existing value in the same section, update the value)? </p>  <p>Hope that makes sense.</p>
