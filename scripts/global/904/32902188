<p>I am developing an Android application which communicates with php on the server  side to access database. But to update the data when I use <code>POST</code> method, not able to get <code>$_POST</code> in the php, it has been empty. I tried with <code>postman</code>chrome plugin to see if its an issue with the application, but even in this case <code>$_POST</code> is empty. I am using php 5.2.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php      echo "hello"; // Works fine.      switch($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'])     {         case 'GET': echo "GET"; break;         case 'POST': echo "POST"; break; // prints POST         default: echo "DEFAULT";     }      echo $_POST; // Not printing as its empty     if(empty($HTTP_POST_VARS ))     {         echo "POST EMPTY"; // This is printed     } ...  ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
