<p>I am currently working on a form for a retail outlet where in I need to submit form on enter keyup and redirect the form to the same page. On enter keyup the ajax post is being submitted to a php function and on successful data insert I am doing a page redirect. Which I am able to do currently, but in few instances the users are hitting the enter key multiple times (may be 3 to 4 times in a sec) because of which the for is being submitted multiple times. How do I prevent multiple submission. Have tried to generate a random number and pass as session token but, each submission is generating a new random number.  Here is my code</p>  <pre><code>    $(document).keyup(function(e){     if (e.keyCode == 13) {          var postData = $("#invoiceForm").serialize();             $.ajax({             url: "addsale()",             type: "post",             data: postData         });         e.preventDefault();         return false;     } }); </code></pre>
