<p>Following situation: I have a form with mostly  dropdown lists which I populate from a database. There's also a text input field. The form is sent via POST. What I'm wondering is, is it really necessary to sanitize the $_POST variables (besides the text input field, of course) before putting them in an sql query? After all, it's not really user input if it came from a drop down list that I created. With $_GET I would understand the recommendation as it would be possible to manipulate the variables being sent. But AFAIK, that's not possible with POST.</p>
