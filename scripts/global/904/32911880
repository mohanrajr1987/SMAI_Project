<p>I am trying to perform a POST request with basic authentication to get an access token from an api. I have to pass grant_type and a code that I request before that in the body of the request and basic auth with username and password in the header.The whole request has to be x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8 encoded. </p>  <p>It seems like I'm out of my depth here as I keep getting bad request errors.</p>  <p>This is the relevant part of the code</p>  <pre><code>  var code_cont = examplecode;    $.ajax({     type: 'POST',         url: 'https://example.com',         data: {"grant_type":'authorization_code', 'code': code_cont},         dataType: 'json',         success: function(data) {             console.log(data);         },         beforeSend : function(req) {             req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic username:password');         },   }); </code></pre>  <p>For username and password I inserted the relevant information.</p>  <p>Could anyone point me in the right direction as to where I'm going wrong? Thanks a lot!</p>
