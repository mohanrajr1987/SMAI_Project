<p>I'm supposed to make an old sqlite database editable trough a Sketchup Plugin in its WebDialog. Sketchups Ruby is not able to install the sqlite3 gem and since I already need to display the table in a WebDialog, I opted for a micro service with the help of Nancy. The existing Plugin already uses the <a href="http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSuite/" rel="nofollow">dhtmlxSuite</a> and its Grid Component is exactly what I need. They even offer a <code>Connector</code> that can send requests based on the actions of the user in the grid.</p>  <p>They also offer a connector for the server side, but that <em>too</em> does not work with sqlite. I already managed to connect to my database, used <code>Dapper</code> to bin the result of an SQL query to an object and return that data with a manually crafted JSON object. Very hacky, but it populates the data successful.</p>  <p>Now the client-<code>Connector</code> sends data manipulated by the user (delete and insert is forbidden) back with an url encoded POST request that looks quite weird:</p>  <pre><code>4_gr_id=4&amp;4_c0=0701.041&amp;4_c1=Diagonale%20f%3Fr%202.07%20X%201.50%20m&amp;4_c2=AR&amp;4_c3=8.3&amp;4_c4=380&amp;4_c5=38.53&amp;4_c6=0&amp;4_c7=0&amp;4_!nativeeditor_status=updated&amp;ids=4 </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure exactly why the hell they would use the row index inside the key for the key-value pairs, but this just makes my life that much harder. The only thing that comes to my mind is extracting the data I'm interested in with a regex, but that sounds even worse than what I did before.</p>  <p>Any suggestions for me how I could map that POST request to something usable?</p>
