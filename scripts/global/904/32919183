<p>I have a raspberry pi running a lamp stack, an arduino and a camera hooked up. The end goal is that when my arduino takes a photo, it then writes an image to a php address which is then emailed.</p>  <p>Right now, I'm trying to get the image to get placed in the right place.</p>  <p>Here's my php snippet:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php print_r($_FILES); move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], "/var/www/images/mypic.jpg"); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My python code is doing:</p>  <pre><code>import requests r = requests.get('https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png') r2 = requests.post('http://192.168.1.100/accept_image.php', data = r.content) </code></pre>  <p>I realize the image is going to get overwritten. That's not a problem. I can always add a timestamp later etc etc.</p>  <p>However, this gives me an error code. I'm a beginner at php and use python mainly for scientific computing so not sure if I'm passing the picture correctly. I know that the ip is correct as I can connect to it and it's all in network. </p>  <p>I have looked at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25544132/python-script-send-image-to-php">Python script send image to PHP</a> but am still getting stuck.</p>  <p>EDIT: Upon further debugging:</p>  <pre><code>print_r($_POST); </code></pre>  <p>returns an empty array. Not sure why?</p>
