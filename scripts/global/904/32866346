<p>I would like to know if I can send html elements attributes (like <code>id</code>, <code>class</code> or <code>title</code>) with a classic <code>post form</code> and save them in a db.</p>  <p>I know this is possible with <code>AJAX</code>, saving the values in variables with javascript and then sending them to a PHP file with <code>$.post</code> or <code>$.ajax</code></p>  <p>But is it possible with a normal post submit form?</p>  <p>Thanks to all</p>
