<p>so I'm trying I'm trying to send a specific section of my URL string, to my php file, to then populate my page accordingly. Everything is working fine, except for the AJAX POST method. I've tried doing var_dump of the POST variable in my PHP, and my array is empty (so I know nothing is getting through). The success DOES return as being passed, so I don't know where the data is going. I'm testing locally on XAMPP, and I've combed through SoF and no luck on any of the fixes. My Code is below, and thanks for looking</p>  <p>Edit: Don't down vote because you don't want to bother looking at it, or think its not worth "your time". SoF is here for us to ask questions, and learn from others. Please be respectful of that, because my issue could help another developer</p>  <p>Edit: Screen shot of page <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zPaK2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zPaK2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>JQuery AJAX Request:</p>  <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {     str = window.location.href;     pos = str.search("pages/"); //42     send = str.slice(42, -5);     console.log(send);     console.log(pos);     $.ajax({         type: "POST",         url: "retrieve.php",         data: {             tom: send         },         success: function() {             $.get("retrieve.php", function(data, status) {                     $("#main").html(data);                 }) //ends GET function            },         error: function() {             console.log(arguments)         }     }); //ends POST request                }); //ends DOC-READY function </code></pre>  <p>PHP: </p>  <pre><code>echo "&lt;i&gt;hello&lt;/i&gt;"; echo var_dump($_POST); $url = $_POST['tom']; json_decode($url); echo $url; </code></pre>
