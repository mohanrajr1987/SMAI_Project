<p>I need to Run a .exe in a MATLAB project which changes some parameters in a txt file. I wrote:</p>  <pre><code>system('C:\path\to\Program1.exe') </code></pre>  <p>but it doesn't work and the error shown is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Program1 ERROR: License not detected!</p> </blockquote>  <p>The program is correctly installed with license and it works, if I open the application. The license txt file is in the same folder as the .exe file. What is the problem? Is the source code necessary?</p>
