<p>I am using MATLAB R2015b. I am trying to import a excel file full of dates using <code>xlsread('filename.xls')</code>. The dates looks like the followings:</p>  <pre><code>02/01/1996 03/01/1996 04/01/1996 05/01/1996 08/01/1996 </code></pre>  <p>then I want use datevec to separate the day month and year. for date = '02/01/1996'(January 2nd 1996), <code>datevec</code> gives <code>Y= 1996, M = 2, D= 1,H=0 MN=0 S=0</code>. For date '29/12/2000' (Dec 29 2000), datevec gives <code>Y = 35, M=5 D =23 H=0 MN=0 S=0</code>. I tried to change the date format in excel, but it still does not work. Can anyone let me know how can I fix this please?</p>
