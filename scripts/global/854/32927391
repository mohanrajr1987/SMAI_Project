<p>Imagine you have a function in MATLAB of two variables, <code>f(x,y)</code>. And it was written in a way that <code>x</code> can be a scalar or a 1D array, but <code>y</code> is strictly meant to be a scalar. For an array <code>x</code> the function returns the array of elements of the same length as <code>x</code>.</p>  <p>Next, you need to refactor this function to accept both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to be 1D arrays of equal length, the value of a function <code>f([x1,x1],[y1,y2]) = [f(x1,y1), f(x2,y2)]</code>.</p>  <p>How would you do this in the most efficient way?</p>
