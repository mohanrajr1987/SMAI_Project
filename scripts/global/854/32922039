<p>I would like to load a C dll into matlab in order to call its functions. From <a href="http://ch.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/loadlibrary.html" rel="nofollow">Matworks</a> website, I've read how to use <code>loadlibrary</code>:</p>  <pre><code>loadlibrary('foo.dll','foo.h')  </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>Index exceeds matrix dimensions.  Error in loadlibrary&gt;getLoadlibraryCompilerConfiguration (line 527) Error in loadlibrary (line 263) </code></pre>  <p>From several websites such as <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/336561" rel="nofollow">this page</a> it is said that I need to install a C compiler. </p>  <p>I really don't understand why I need to install a C compiler. Moreover I don't know which C compiler I should install. </p>  <p>When I load a dll with <a href="/questions/tagged/perl" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;perl&#39;" rel="tag">perl</a> or <a href="/questions/tagged/python" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;" rel="tag">python</a> I can easily load a DLL without the need for a C compiler. </p>  <p>So my question is:</p>  <p>How to call a DLL function from matlab without the need for a C compiler and the header file as I do with <code>ctypes</code> in Python?</p>
