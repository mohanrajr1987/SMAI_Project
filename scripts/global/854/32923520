<p>I encountered a non-linear system of equations that has to be solved. The system of equations can be written as: <code>Ax + exp(x) = b</code> with <code>b</code> a known <code>Nx1</code> matrix, <code>A</code> a known <code>NxN</code> matrix, and <code>x</code> the unknown <code>Nx1</code> vector for which has to be solved. The <code>exp</code> is defined element-wise on the <code>x</code> vector. I tried to search the MATLAB-manual but I'm having a hard time finding how to solve this kind of equations with MATLAB, so I hope someone can help me out.</p>
