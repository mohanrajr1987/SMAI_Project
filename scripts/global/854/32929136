<p>I have a function that I use for single strings. However, I want to extend this to many text files. </p>  <p>My text files are of the form of:</p>  <p><em>first line of garbage</em></p>  <p><em>continuous text with no spaces</em></p>  <p><em>continuous text with no spaces</em></p>  <p><em>continuous text with no spaces</em></p>  <p><em>continuous text with no spaces</em></p>  <p>There are no blank spaces between the lines (Stack Overflow requires a double space for a new line). I would like to read each line of continuous text and store it in the element of a cell of strings. How could I do this? </p>  <p>EDIT: I know I would have to do something along the lines of:</p>  <pre><code>file1 = fopen(link','rb'); while file ~EOF grab every text value by line, call it data file1 = fopen(file1, data) store in cell array </code></pre>
