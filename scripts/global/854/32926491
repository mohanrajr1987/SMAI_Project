<p>I am using Matlab R2014a and have discovered that for some plots any bold text size 16 or larger (produced either with the text or title functions) always has the end cut off, no matter how long it is. So even a title like title('Simple Correlation','FontSize',16,'FontWeight','bold') appears as Simple Correlati but reducing the FontSize to 14 makes everything fine, but it's no longer looks bolded. Any thoughts?</p>
