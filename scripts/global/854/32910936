<p>I am using a COM component to run Matlab code from a c# app.</p>  <p>Within this I am using the Feval function which has the following form:</p>  <pre><code>matlab.Feval("MatlabFunction", 1, out result, param1, param2...., paramN); </code></pre>  <p>Having the parameters passed in like this isn't very ideal as I would like to have one function matlabExecutor which can run any function but because of the way Feval takes in parameters it looks as though I will need to have a wrapper function per Matlab function.</p>  <p>Note: Yes I can pass in an array as a parameter but that would mean changing ALL of my Matlab scripts which I don't particularly want to do.</p>  <p>I've given reflection a quick go but couldn't seem to work out how to use it with a COM object.</p>
