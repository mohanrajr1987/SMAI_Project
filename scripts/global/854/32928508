<p>I am using "getframe" in a for loop to create a movie in MATLAB. I want to play the clip in Powerpoint presentation. I'm not sure what is the best way to save and transfer the movie to Powerpoint. I've tried "movie2avi":</p>  <pre><code>movie2avi(F, 'mymovie.avi', 'compression', 'None');  </code></pre>  <p>However, when I play it back in Windows Media Player, I basically get noisy green and pink horizontal lines.  Any suggestions please?</p>
