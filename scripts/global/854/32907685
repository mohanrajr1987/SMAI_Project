<p>I am trying to allocate space to my for loop but it just won't work.</p>  <p>I have looked at all the similar questions and matlab help and it doesn't make any difference. I must be missing something.</p>  <pre><code>xt = []; yt = [];  for ii = 1:size(result,1)         x = result{ii,1}(:,1);           xt = [xt;x];         y = result{ii,1}(:,2);           yt = [yt;y]; end </code></pre>  <p>And my attempt at precollacting space for xt has been</p>  <pre><code>xt = zeros(size(result,1),1); </code></pre>  <p>with no results. I think my problem might be that <code>result</code> is a cell array??</p>
