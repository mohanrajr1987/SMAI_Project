<p>I would like to generate 3D (white) objects in black-white images using Matlab's nlfilter (or a similar function/tool). </p>  <p>In 2D, I start with some white seed points, which eventually define the regions/objects in my 2D image. By applying nlfilter successively, I can naturally grow these regions until all pixels are labeled. I'd like to do a similar thing in 3D, but nlfilter works only on 2D images. Treating a 3D image as a stack of 2D images and applying nlfilter on each such slice is one of the possible ways to overcome this problem, but it's not suboptimal. Instead, an nlfilter3d() function would have been much more convenient.  Does any similar function exist in Matlab or elsewhere?</p>
