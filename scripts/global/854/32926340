<p>Is there a way to obtain the same output of function <code>convhulln</code> in R as the function <code>convhull</code> in MATLAB? From MATLAB's <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/convhull.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, the return value are the <strong>indices</strong> of the points in the convex hull. That's exactly what I'd like to obtain from the function in R, but it returns something else.</p>  <p>Example in R:</p>  <pre><code>x &lt;- c(0.75, 0.4444444, 1, 0.4444444, 0, 0.5714286, 0.375, 0.6, 0.6, 0) y &lt;- c(-0.126041542, -0.620976031, -0.002691156, 0.018197512, -0.425852668, -0.627632203, -0.420934248, -0.598322014, -0.456823899,  0.011022270) k &lt;- convhulln(cbind(x,y)) </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to plot the points and the convex hull as a line. Something like:</p>  <pre><code>plot(x,y) lines(x[k],y[k]) </code></pre>  <p>But again, the problem is that <code>k</code> doesn't contain the indices. Alternatively, is there a way to obtain that plot with the return values from the R's function?</p>
