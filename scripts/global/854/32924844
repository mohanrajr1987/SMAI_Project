<p>I am generating a bar graph of something vs time of day (i.e., 24 hours). Later, my supervisor tells me that in the dataset, the time is offset by 8 hours, so 7 PM needs to become 3 AM, 12 midnight needs to become 8 AM, etc. In other words, the two axes should remain unaffected. Only the plots in the graph need to be made to shift towards the right by 8 hours (i.e., in a circular kind of pattern, where each value is offset by 8). So, is there a simple, single line function or something to do this in MATLAB? Thanks.</p>  <p>This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>a=str2num(datestr(n(:,1)/86400,'HH'));   bar(histc(a,unique(a))) </code></pre>
