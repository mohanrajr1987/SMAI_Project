<p>I need to create a block in Simulink to deform a video streaming. I create this code for the 'Interpreted MATLAB Fcn' block of Simulink:</p>  <pre><code>function B = deformation(A,tform) %#codegen  B=imwarp(A,tform); </code></pre>  <p>For me now the problem is:</p>  <ul> <li>how to create the block to provide the input of tform that is a structure</li> <li>how to manage A, that is the signal from 'From Video device' block in Simulink </li> </ul>  <p>I already tested imwarp function for a static image, and I've already calculated tform values as input to imwarp</p>  <p>Is there a method to update calculated tform on a block of simulink. They should no change</p>
