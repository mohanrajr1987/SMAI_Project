<p>Can anyone please direct me to some documentation regarding the method of labels-computation for 'rbf' kernel using "predict" function? I assume it does not just do f(x) = sum(alpha(i)*y(i)*rbf(x-x(i))) + bias, for all support-vectors x(i), because I wrote my own version which does just that (using the same scale, same alpha and everything else, which I got by running "fitcsvm"), but got different labels! Your help will be highly appreciated, Nadav</p>
