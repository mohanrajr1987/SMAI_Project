<p>I have designed a low-pass filter with cut-off frequency at 4.82 kHz. The script below contains the transfer function, creates a periodic triangular pulse and passes it through the filter. </p>  <pre><code>h=tf([8.06 *10^22],[1 9.801*10^4 4.803*10^9 1.455*10^14 2.723*10^18 2.549*10^22]) T = 10*(1/2000); Fs = 80000; dt = 1/Fs; t = 0:dt:T-dt; x = sawtooth(2*pi*2000*t,0.5); lsim(h,x',t') </code></pre>  <p>My question is: shouldn't the output also be a triangular pulse,since this is a linear system? If no,can someone explain to me theoritically why this is an accepted output? If yes, is there some adjustment to the code I can make to get the correct output?</p>
