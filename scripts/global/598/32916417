<p>I'm trying to debug some CPU issues caused by a .NET 4.6 MVC5 application by analyzing a dump created by DebugDiag 2.1.0.7. I'm finding even after loading custom .pdb symbols I'm still not getting stacktrack information in the generated report:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ACcqg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ACcqg.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The error that the report displays is</p>  <pre><code>Type: Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime.ClrDiagnosticsException Message:  This runtime is not initialized and contains no data. </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HCAnI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HCAnI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I note that DebugDiag version 1.2 didn't support .NET 4.0+. Could DebugDiag 2.1 perhaps not support .NET 4.6?</p>
