<p>im creating a NodeJS server which will transfer large amounts of data over socketIO. i want to know if there is a limit on how large a JSON object can be in NodeJS. i think there are some limitations in browsers about object sizes, but i dont know what limitation there would be for NodeJS.</p>  <p>i dont expect the objects to amoun tto much on average, but it should be able to scale up to be able to manage 100mb+ (but that is an extreme size).</p>  <p>i was going to store the file into a mongoDB record, but to bypass the requirement of dealing with the filesystem, i though i could keep these files in memory and emit them to the required destination. i wanted to do it this way because i suspect it would be faster than a filesystem write+read operation.</p>  <p>of course this method would mean i would need a 'sickening' RAM spec on the system, but assuming the system had sufficient RAM, is there an object size limit imposed by NodeJS? </p>
