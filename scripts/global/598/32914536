<p>I'm using GameMaker Studio and you can think of it as a giant loop.</p>  <p>I use a counter variable <code>step</code> to keep track of what frame it is.</p>  <p>I'd like to run some code only every Xth step for efficiency.</p>  <pre><code>if step mod 60 {  } </code></pre>  <p>Would run that block every 60 steps (or 1 second at 60 fps).  </p>  <p>My understanding is modulus is a heavy operation though and with thousands of steps I imagine the computation can get out of hand.  Is there a more efficient way to do this?</p>  <p>Perhaps involving bitwise operator?</p>  <p>I know this can work for every other frame:</p>  <pre><code>// Declare counter = 0  // Step counter = (counter + 1) &amp; 1  if counter {  } </code></pre>  <p>Or is the performance impact of modulus negligible at 60FPS even with large numbers?</p>
