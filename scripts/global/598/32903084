<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>  <p>In what ways can I improve render-time in scenario described below?</p>  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>  <p>The task I'm facing is plotting quite a few points on a scatter chart in JavaFX. I'm getting the data from an Oracle DB.</p>  <p>I think my current bottleneck is <code>scatterChart.getData().add(series);</code></p>  <p>The <code>series</code> contains all the datapoints needed in the chart.</p>  <p>Executing this, and rendering the chart on screen may take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes. During this time the GUI freezes up.</p>  <p>We're running some Lenovo Thinkpads with 4 Cores 4 Threads, Intel HD4000 Graphics. </p>  <p>Some examples of finished charts are below. The latter being the current worst case, but as more data is collected, more data will be displayed.</p>  <p>(due to images being impractically large, only links)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X0gnW.png" rel="nofollow">Chart with ~5.5K points</a><br> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rgqGB.png" rel="nofollow">Chart with ~75K points</a></p>  <p><strong>More info</strong></p>  <p>I followed <a href="http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> because I'm new to JavaFX, so I'm not sure exactly how rendering happens.</p>  <p><strong>Code sample</strong></p>  <p>This isn't the actual code I'm using, it's just to illustrate how I'm doing things.</p>  <pre><code>//Reference to the chart in the fxml file. @FXML private ScatterChart&lt;Date, Number&gt; scatterChart = new ScatterChart&lt;&gt;(new DateAxis(), new NumberAxis());  private void handleSelectionUpdate(PerfResultSet newValue){     //newValue is an object containing all the data from the database     XYChart.Series&lt;Date, Number&gt; series = new XYChart.Series&lt;&gt;();     /**     *   adding all the data from newValue to series as      *   XYChart.Data&lt;Date, Number&gt;     *     *   this is handled by multiple threads and does not take long     */      series.setName("myName");       //this statement is where the gui freezes     //can I optimize this in any way?     scatterChart.getData().add(series); } </code></pre>
