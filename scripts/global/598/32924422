<p>I am studying data structures and I have a question that I'm sure many of you will find elementary but I'm going to ask it anyway - </p>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Why is it important to know the run time efficiency of algorithms?</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>How would knowing that information help me to decide which algorithm is the best?</strong> </p></li> </ul>
