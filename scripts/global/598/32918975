<p>I am using <strong>Zxing Core.jar version 3.2.1</strong> to decode the <strong>PDF417</strong> and <strong>MAXICODE</strong> on android. Other barcode types like code_39, RSS_14 etc. are decoded perfectly in a moment But unfortunately I am unable to get the result for these two types and camera is focusing again and again but no success.</p>  <p>can any one guide me how to resolve this problem or to use any other good library for decoding these two types specificly, by the way i am testing my app on Samsung Galaxy SII.</p>
