<p>I have a java program that reads data from a database, processes the data and writes it to csv files. The written data can be quite big (2 files are ~600 MB, the total is usually around 1.5 GB, divided in 16 files).</p>  <p>When I run the program with eclipse (Windows 7), it takes around 1 hour.</p>  <p>When I deploy the program on our server, it takes 3.5 hours.</p>  <p>In both cases, the database used is the same.</p>  <p>Does it mean I can rule out the database being the source of the problem ?</p>  <p>If so, what could cause that increase in time execution ?</p>  <p>JVM parameters in eclipse : Java 7, -Xms1200m, I have 4 GB RAM</p>  <p>JVM parameters in solaris : Java 6, -Xms2048M -Xmx3072M, I have 256 GB RAM, with usually 60 GB free.</p>  <p><strong>Answers to comments :</strong></p>  <p>@Jordi Castilla : Well, I've run the top command a few times, and the free memory was always at least 60 GB. But I don't know for sure.</p>  <p>@Pradeep Sekar, @dasblinkenlight : how do I check that ?</p>  <p>@jwenting : no SSD, just plain old HDD</p>  <p>@RealSkeptic : what do you mean ? On the same server as the one I am running the program ?</p>  <p>@Drazan Bozanovic : not yet, because it proves difficult and lengthy to install plugins, softwares, tools, that are not standard in my company (and profiling tools have not yet been approved)</p>  <p>@Andrew Henle : </p>  <pre><code>r/s     w/s     kr/s    kw/s    wait    actv    wsvc_t  asvc_t  %w  %b  device 1.6     6.5     47.9    207.6   0.0     0.0     0.8     2.5     0   1   risuatfs01-nfs:/RISUATAP01/ACF </code></pre>
