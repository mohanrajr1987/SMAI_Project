<p>in this post i am trying to find a good working query for me:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32782008/mysql-merge-two-tables-with-different-timestamps-to-one-query-output/32782090#32782090">Mysql: Merge two tables with different timestamps to one query output</a></p>  <p>,but it takes a little bit to much system capacity. First of all i need to Group it and than just take out only the temperatures for some dates something like this:</p>  <pre><code>    SELECT sum(t1.`wert`), DATE_FORMAT(t1.`timestamp`, '%Y-%m-%d %H') as dates, (select t2.`aussentemp`     from `Temperaturen` t2     where t2.`TimeDate` &lt;= dates     order by t2.`TimeDate` desc     limit 1    ) as austemp from `gaszaehler` t1     where PERIOD_ADD(DATE_FORMAT(NOW(),'%Y%m'), -1) = DATE_FORMAT(t1.`timestamp`,'%Y%m')      GROUP By dates     order by dates asc </code></pre>  <p>But this is too slow. Can someone help me? Thanks a lot.</p>  <p>cu kami</p>
