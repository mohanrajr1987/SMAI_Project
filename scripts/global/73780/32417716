<p>I'm trying to run Angular2 alpha 35</p>  <p>I have a server setup with a static shelf server. It works fine for publishing to heroku after pub build. </p>  <p>When i use pub serve to test locally, i don't seem to have control over routing, and i need more granular control to modify the routes to always point to index.html - (client side routing) </p>  <p>When i use shelf to point to the web folder - i can serve the asset - but i lose all of my dart transformers. </p>  <p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>  <p>What is the best approach to serve a SPA for a native Dart project with client side routing?   </p>
