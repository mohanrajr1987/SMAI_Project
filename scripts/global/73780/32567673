<p>I am trying to exclude a list of files or directories when building a web application with dart's <code>pub build</code>. Using this, as suggested by the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/assets-and-transformers.html#excluding-assets" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>  <pre><code>transformers: - simple_transformer:     $exclude: "**/CVS" </code></pre>  <p>does not work:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error on line 10, column 3 of pubspec.yaml: "simple_transformer" is not a dependency.</p>      <p>- simple_transformer:</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is there a way to do it (using SDK 1.10.0) ?</p>
