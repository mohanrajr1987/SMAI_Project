<p>I need to develop an interactive mock-up of website, it should have different interface (dialogs) before user registration and after user registration, also after registration it should have the list of pictures and html games. I like Dart (and created my own libraries), but I didn't use Dart Angular or Polymer. Is it a good approach to create all dialogs (interface) and to send it before user registration? Or how to create web app with dynamically loadable multi screens? Thanks.</p>  <p>Main idea / request - to download separate parts (screens) from a server and to provide less information before registration / login .</p>
