<p>I've looked for this on the internet, but cannot find a working example. Can someone direct me to get CSS variables working in Dart. source: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/</a> Someone mentioned csslib, but I don't see a solution per: <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/16710" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/16710</a> <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/csslib/issues/9" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dart-lang/csslib/issues/9</a></p>  <p>I'm trying to get this working inside of polymer component:</p>  <pre><code>:host {     --text-color: #4f1f91; } .someLabel {   color: var(--text-color); } </code></pre>  <p>I understand I could use dart/polymer variables and do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>.someLabel {   color: {{ polymerVar }}; } </code></pre>  <p>But, why are CSS variables not working on 08/2015??</p>
