<p>I am using Polymer <code>paper-tabs</code> - all working fine.</p>  <p>I want to programmatically select a <code>paper-tab</code>, and <strong>show</strong> it as selected/highlighted. Functionally there is no problem, but the tab is not showing "the correct colour" (=as highlighted).</p>  <p>I have used:</p>  <pre><code> PaperTabs mypaperTabs=...   mypaperTabs.selected = "#mytab'; </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code> myTab.click(); </code></pre>  <p>The previously selected tab does correctly become unselected. So it is showing as all tabs as unselected. Is there something else I should be doing?</p>
