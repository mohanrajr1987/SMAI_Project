<p>I am knocking together a quick debugging view of a backend, as a small set of admin HTML pages (driven by angulardart, but not sure that is critical).</p>  <p>I get back from my XHR call a complex JSON object.  I want to see that on the HTML page formatted nicely.  It doesn't have to be a great implementation, as its just a debug ui, but the goal is to format the object instead of having it be one long string with no newlines.</p>  <p>I looked at trying to pretty print JSON in dart then putting that inside <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tags, as well as just dumping the dart Map object to string (again, inside or not inside <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tags.  But not getting to where I want.</p>  <p>Even searched pub for something similar, such as a syntax highlighter that would output html, but didn't find something obvious.</p>  <p>Any recommendations?</p>
