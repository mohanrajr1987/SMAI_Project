<p>I am having issues making an http.get() request since I updated to dart 1.12. I am using Windows 10 to develop on with IntelliJ IDEA (15 EAP) as the editor.  When I send a request I get the following error: </p>  <p>864050208:error:100be07e:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED:src\ssl\s3_clnt.c:1031:</p>  <p>[2015-9-10 9:52:56.021] HandshakeException: Handshake error in client (OS Error: Unknown error from BoringSSL library, errno = 0)</p>  <p>I have looked up the issue and only one source was found but did not fix the Problem. <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/24208" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/24208</a></p>  <p>Can someone explain what I need to do to fix this issue?</p>  <p>Code: </p>  <p>I am getting the error when requesting the token</p>  <pre><code>var requestAuthToken= await http.post('https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens', headers : {'Content-Type':'application/json'}, body: JSON.encode({"auth": {"RAX-KSKEY:apiKeyCredentials":{"username":"XXXXXXXX","apiKey":"XXXXXXXXXXXXX"}}}));  var authResponse = JSON.decode(requestAuthToken.body); String token = authResponse['access']['token']['id'];  List&lt;int&gt; binaryData = [11,22,44,111,333...];  var upload = new http.Request('PUT', Uri.parse('https://storage101.iad3.clouddrive.com/v1/MossoCloudFS_xxxxxxx/xxxxxxx/testimage2.jpg')); upload.headers['X-Auth-Token'] = token; upload.headers['Content-Type'] = 'image/jpeg'; upload.bodyBytes = binaryData; await upload.send(); </code></pre>
