<p>I have updated the dart-sdk and dartium but when I go into intellij to update the plug-in, It will tell me there is not a newer version from 141.1586 when 142.4509 is the latest version. So I have tried to download and install the plugin manually but I get an error "Plugin 'Dart' is incompatible with this installation". I have even gone as far as shutting down Intellij IDEA 14.1.4 and overwritting the files in the plugin directory (which didn't work). Does anyone know what I need to do to fix this issue? </p>  <p>I am running Windows 10 64bit</p>
