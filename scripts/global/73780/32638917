<p>I'm trying to build a simple accordion Polymer component. I have it working so when I click on an item in the list, an <code>open</code> class is added to the item which shows its contents.</p>  <p>I don't want to be able to have multiple items open at a time, so in my click function, I essentially want to say:</p>  <pre><code>$(".list-item").on("click", function() {     $("list-item").removeClass("open");     $(this).addClass("open"); }  </code></pre>  <p>Of course this is in jQuery and not Dart...so that doesn't help me much.</p>  <p>What's the above equivalent in Dart?</p>  <p>Here's what I have working right now (just opens each clicked item, but doesn't close others in the process).</p>  <pre><code>     _openedChanged: function() {       if (this.opened) {         this.toggleClass('open', true);       }       else {         this.toggleClass('open', false);       }       this.setAttribute('aria-expanded', this.opened ? 'true' : 'false');     } </code></pre>
