<p>I cannot seem to install MDL for Dart. My files are very simple.</p>  <p>pubspec.yaml:</p>  <pre><code>name: mdl_test dependencies:   mdl: "^1.0.0"   browser: '^0.10.0'   di: "^3.3.4" transformers:   - di </code></pre>  <p>main.dart:</p>  <pre><code>import 'package:mdl/mdl.dart' as mdl; main() async {   mdl.registerMdl();   await mdl.componentFactory().run(); } </code></pre>  <p>I am getting multiple errors.  Example: <code>Target of URI does not exist: package:logging/logging.dart</code> - I checked, and logging is downloaded properly. There are many "Target of URI does not exist" errors as well.  It seems that packages in main.dart are imported fine, but packages installed with pub, that import other packages, are not working.  Does anyone know why this is, or what the fix is?  Thanks.</p>
