<p>My web app uses (and stores) data in a large [Dart] map. Considering memory and efficiency/performance, should I use an int or a String for the keys, understanding that ints are always 64bit?</p>  <p>As a very simple example:</p>  <pre><code> Map one=new Map();  one[1]=somedata;  one[2]=somedata2;  one[3]=somedata3;   Map two=new Map();  two['1']=somedata;  two['2']=somedata2;  two['3']=somedata3;   Map big =new Map(); </code></pre>  <p>with <b>big</b> storing hundreds of <b>one and two</b>.  </p>  <p>Does one['12345678']=x use the same amount of memory as one[1]=x?</p>  <p>(This would be easy to test if there were a sizeof(one)! )</p>  <p>Should I be bothered at all?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Steve </p>
