<p>This is an old problem, but slightly different. Sorry for being dim. I see answers in python, c#...  This is for Dart</p>  <p>I don't know/understand if I can use list "sort" and "compare" with this. Tried using map, iterable, intersection...</p>  <p>I want to sort a string list (with duplicates) by comparing with another list. The list to sort is:</p>  <p>To sort: <b>[apple,pear,apple,x,x,orange,x,pear]</b></p>  <p>and the list that specifies the order is </p>  <p>Sort by: <b>[orange,apple,x,pear]</b></p>  <p>so the output will be:</p>  <p>Result : <b>[orange,apple,apple,x,x,x,pear,pear]</b></p>  <p>Is there a clean way of doing this?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Steve</p>
