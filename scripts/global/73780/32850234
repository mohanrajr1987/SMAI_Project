<p>I am using Angular Dart and have an ng-repeat loop in which some angular components are being created.  I want to be notified when each component has been loaded.  I am drawing a graph in these components and I'm seeing that for some of them, the graph is trying to draw prior to the component actually existing, which is why I'd like to be notified when it has loaded.  </p>  <p>In the component html I have added a ng-load event to trigger.  This event gets triggered when running in Chrome, but not in Firefox.  Does anyone have any ideas why?  Or any suggestions of solutions?  </p>  <p>Here is a snippet of my code:</p>  <p>Task List html</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="list"&gt;     &lt;div style="height: 100%;"&gt;         &lt;ul id="listID" class="no-bullets"&gt;             &lt;div id="inner-content-div"&gt;                 &lt;li class="pointer" ng-repeat="task in taskList()"&gt;                     &lt;task&gt;&lt;/task&gt;                 &lt;/li&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/ul&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Task Component html</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="task-panel"&gt;     &lt;div class="container"&gt;          &lt;div id="taskId" ng-load="{{taskcmp.onLoad()}}"&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
