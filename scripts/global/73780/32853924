<p>I have component in Angular 2 called my-comp:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;my-comp&gt;&lt;/my-comp&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How does one style the host element of this component in Angular 2?</p>  <p>In Polymer, You would use ":host" selector. I tried it in Angular 2. But it doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>:host {   display: block;   width: 100%;   height: 100%; } </code></pre>  <p>I also tried using the component as selector:</p>  <pre><code>my-comp {   display: block;   width: 100%;   height: 100%; } </code></pre>  <p>Both approaches don't seem to work.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
