Positive 1000 pWe have a Junit test suite that is run using jenkins. When one or some of the tests continue to run longer than expected, jenkins times aborts the job after a certain period of time. I have seen people asking questions on how to time out tests, but my question is more on what is the right way to handle timeout issues at jenkins level or at the framework level or at the individual test levelp

Positive 1000 pSo I have this class Im testing. Its a helper that pulls stuff out of some  XML classes. The XML classes are kind of a Russian Doll arrangement where you have to dig through many levels to get the right thing you need. Problem is that the class under test calls many of its own methods. This makes it pretty hard to test without a bunch of redundancy. This is to say that I dont want to retest any of those low hanging fruit methods that retrieve objects from shallow locations if I can avoid it. I smell an opportunity for a refactor here but Im unsure what it should be. Note that there are often 6 and 7 levels to our Russian Doll. My intuition says that I should maybe refactor the class under test to a hierarchy of classes, roughly one for each level in our Russian Doll. Then maybe I could test one at a time without redundancy. p  pQuestions What are the patterns I should be looking at for this Is there an approach for doing this which is Composition rather than Inheritance basedp

Positive 1000 pI am running multiple JUnit tests in parallel classes using Maven. I have clean up tasks that need to happen after all JUnit tests run.

Positive 1000 pAs a preface, our setup is somewhat unusual due to legacy reasons. It is fully possible that I am going against the grain with this. I would love to get an expert opinion on whether it is possible to get my current setup working or a suggestion on a different approach.p  h2Environmenth2  pJava application with over 10K unit tests in JUnit. For legacy reasons the entire unit test run takes a long time the ultimate goal is to fix the root of the problem, but this will not happen soon.p  pThe application is broken up into multiple modules, with each module having its own unit tests. Executing tests module by module takes a reasonable amount of time, so that if someone commits the code to repo subtree with modules code and only modules tests get executed, they can get a result quickly.p  h2Current Jenkins Setuph2  h3JUnit jobh3  pThis is the single emparameterizedem job that can run tests for any module. The job takes in as parameters the regexs for which tests to run and a parameter indicating which module it is running, for notification purposes. It checks out emthe wholeem repo tree and then does the run based on the parameters.p  pAfter the completion of the run this job does the analysis of JUnits, publishes the report and sends out email notifications.p  h3Repo watchersh3  pOne repo watcher for each module. The watcher checks out only the repo subtree that it wants to monitor. When a change is detected it triggers the JUnit job telling it which tests to run and for what component this is.p  h2Questionh2  pIn general the setup works well, does exactly what I need, however it breaks a few of the nice and expected features of Jenkins and JUnit plugin.p  ol liBecause the same job keeps executing different subsets of unit tests, the job to job comparison between unit tests does not provide any value. Without manually scanning between jobs it is not possible to tell what changed in terms of new failures or new fixes to unit tests.li liSomething very similar happens to change history  Each repo watches runs on its own schedule. Suppose we have a change to module A and a change to module B, very close time wise to each other. If watcher A triggers first, the JUnit job triggered by watcher A will claim both changes. When the JUnit job triggered by watcher B runs, it will not detect any new changes in the repo. This plays havoc with email notifications, as the second JUnit job would not know who broke the build.li ol  pAt the end of the day I believe I am looking for a way to establish dependency relationship between non sequential job runs in Jenkins for the same job, or alternatively a totally different approach.p  pThank youp

Positive 1000 pI have a large number of tests that run against a relational database via JDBC.  At the moment many of those test classes create their own schemas and schema objects tables, etc.  We have also seen that for inmemory databases, each test is recreating the actual database instance.  All told the tests take way longer to run than they should.p  pSo I want to move as much as possible the tests to use a number of predefined schemas and have some way to hook creating and dropping of these schemas to JUnit lifecycle.  I am initially thinking a Rule that tells which catalogsschemas are in use by that test.  The Rule would then coordinate with some central registry to create the catalogsschemas on first use and drop them after all tests are done.p  pWould that be a good way to go about this  Would that be the best wayp  pThanksp

You will implement unit tests in your given framework that test the correctness of your code.p  pBefore you start p  pTry not to read ahead.p  pDo one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.p  pMake sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs for this assignmentp  pString Calculatorp  pCreate a simple StringCalculator class with a method that returns an integer called  Addstring numbersp  pThe method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum for an empty string it will return 0 for example  or 1 or 1,2.p  pStart with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbersp  pRemember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think aboutp  pRemember to refactor after each passing testp  pAllow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbersp  pCalling Add with a negative number will throw an exception negatives not allowed  and the negative that was passed.if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message. There should be a test case that tests for the exception.p  pNumbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2  1001   2p  pYou will need a minimum of 4 test cases.p  pDo not submit this assignment yet, we will submit it after completing Part B next week. p

Negative 1000 pThe team where I work still uses a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTeamWare relnofollowSUN Teamwarea for Source Code Management SCM. Ive worked with it for a while now over 10 months and I dont have any particular complaints about it.p  pTeamware has been used to manage Suns largest source trees, including those for the Solaris operating system and the Java system, and it works pretty well. But it is also an old commercial closedsource product that has been discontinued. This came as part of the process of Sun converting their code bases to open source communities which by its turn led to moving to newer revision control systems such as Mercurial.p  pThis makes me feel a bit like weve got stuck in time using Teamware and the world has moved on to newer systems. I do not however miss any particular functionality except maybe having a web view of the source tree to navigate through and see the history of files something we do with the VersionTool so not critical.p  pShould a team using SUN Teamware migrate to a SCM more modern like git or Mercurialp  pAnd more important, what arguments can you present to the rest of the team to support that transitionp

Everything went well, the script is working, but now that its ready, Ive started to wonder about the details.p  pAs a part of the script, I need to find specific  element and hide it, together with previous and next of its siblings. Ive ended up with not that readable, but working linep  precodedivsomeweirdbox.prev.togglew.next.togglew.next.togglew codepre  pMy concern here is, that Im removing three separate divs in three separate steps. This would cause browser to repaint the page three times, right Its not a problem with three divs, it would probably start to matter when there are more elements. So, my question is  is there a way to tell browser stop refreshingredrawing the page If there is, I could use that, hide arbitrary number of elements, then ask browser to update the screen.p

Negative 1000 pI am having problems while saving a prepersisted JDO object in googleappengine data store. Basically, in one servlet, I create the object and save it. In another servlet, I read the object, set a bunch of properties and try updating it. The update is through a emmakePersistentem call on emPersistenceManagerem. There is no exception being thrown and no warning logs. However, when I access the same object later, its still in its original state. p  pThe emPersistenceManagerem is never closed between the read and the update as suggested in the a hrefhttpcode.google.comappenginedocsjavadatastorecreatinggettinganddeletingdata.html relnofollowDatastore documentationap  pThe only thing that might be different than the example in the documentation is that the reads are for lists, but the updates are done for the independent object. There is nothing in the documentation that discourages this. Could that be a problemp  pTo complete the context, I am trying this only in Eclipse and havent yet actually tried it in the AppEngine. Any suggestions on what might be happeningp
Negative 1000 pSimple question, I know, but I cant seem to find a way to put both single and double quotes into the string of the text property of a Literal in asp.netp  precodeltaspLiteral runatserver idLiteral1 TextThis is my text, isnt it pretty gt codepre  pFor example, in the above code snippet.  The string closes on the first doublequote around text.  I know I could replace them with single quotes or use all double quotes and wrap the string in single quotes, but Im not sure how to use both.  Escaping the quotes doesnt seem to work.p  pSetting the string on the codebehind is an option, of course, where I can escape the double quotes, but Ive always thought it best to keep static text on the aspx, rather than cluttering the codebehind.p

Negative 1000 pI need a way to open a new URL in firefox from the shell on OS X. The normal way I do this is with the open command ... but the open command doesnt seem to pass queryfragment values when the location is a file uri.

But it appears open wont pass it.p  pI looked at bit at applescript, but couldnt figure out how to tell FF to open a new url, not recent versions of FF anyway. open must be communicating with the running firefox to open new urls but heck if I can figure out how its doing it.p
Negative 1000 pI have a problem with Sum fields in Crystal Reports, under VS 2003. I am using VS 2003 and Crystal Reports to generate a report with data retrieved from a SQL Server 2000 database and kept during runtime inside a strongly typed dataset.p  pThe dataset contains several tables, one of which, the strongordersstrong table, receives the results of a SQL query, that joins records from two different tables. After checking the contents of the strongordersstrong table during runtime  just before passing the dataset to the Report object, I have verified that the SQL query in question is working correctly, always returning the expected data from the database.p  pThe dataset is iterated over, each iteration merging the results of the SQL query, executed against a different orderID, into the dataset. The SQL query also retrieves records from other tables related to each orderID, and puts them into the appropriate tables other than strongordersstrong in the dataset.p  pThe problem appears when I try to sum a particular column, the strongorders.orderamountstrong column,  onto a Crystal Report. The sum I get is incorrect. p  pFor example, the strongordersstrong table contains 3 records at the time it is bound as the reports datasource, each with an strongorderamountstrong  10.00. Instead of returning 30.00, the value of the sum field is something like 50.00.p  pI cant see how this could happen, I assume that this is either due to a bug in Crystal Reports, or a result of a missing item from my report. The dataset is correctly populated, but it appears that Crystal Reports somehow confuses the related records retrieved based on the strongorderIDstrongs as being records of the strongordersstrong table, and adds to the strongorderamountstrong sum. p  pIf I disable the SELECT statement that populates the related records, the strongorderamountstrong sum is shown correctly.p  pAnybody got any idea as to why this happens Thanks in advance.p  pRayp

In emacs, you can choose box cursor or bar cursor, codebarcursormode tcode. When the bar cursor is between the letters A and B, the box cursor is on B. So the bar is the left wall of the box. p  pBTW, the concept of bar cursor is useful in some unusual way  The practice of iterating from index1 to index21 in programming surprises beginners. It helps to imagine index1 and index2 as indicating bars left walls rather than boxes.p

For example an Sblock looks like thisp  precodesblock      grids [       [ [ 0 1 1 ]         [ 1 1 0 ] ]        [ [ 1 0 ]         [ 1 1 ]         [ 0 1 ] ] ]  codepre  pBut that turns out to be rather tricky for simple things like iterating and painting see the code below.p  pFor making the grid mutable my initial idea was to make each row a reference.

But that feels like an unclean approach.p  pIm considering using Java arrays now.

Negative 1000 pIm using ASP.NET MVC 2.0 and I am trying to take advantage of the model binding in my controller and also the modelstate validation.

The UserName for example can only be set when the object is constructed, to me this makes OO sense, but is the key to my problem, so I wanted to highlight it here.p  pI then have a buddy class that defines the validation metadata for my User class...p  precodenamespace Model  [MetadataTypetypeofUserMetadata] public partial class User      class UserMetadata              [Required]         public virtual int Id  get set           [Required]         public virtual string UserName  get set           [Required]         public virtual string DisplayName  get set           [RegularExpression[az09].[az09][az09].[az09].[az]2,4, ErrorMessage  Invalid address]         public virtual string Email  get set        codepre  pp  pThen up in my web layer I want to allow my users to be able to edit this object.

But when the user posts the form back, say after editing their display name, the ModelState is NOT valid.  This is because the UserName property has a private setter on it.  However this is by design, for security and semantics I dont ever want them to change their username, so the setter is private.  However, as I have added the Required attribute to the property, it is failing as it is not setp  pThe question is should the modelbinding be reporting this as a validation error or not  As the property is private, I have designed for it to not be set, therefore by design I dont expect the model binder to be setting it, but I dont want a validation error.  I think it should only produce validation errors for properties that it CAN set.p  pOk so possible solutions I have come up with so far..p  pMake the property public.p  pIf I do this I open myself up to allowing the username to be changed for existing users.  I would have to add extra logic somewhere to catch this, not really very nice.  I would also have to add a Bind Exclude on the action method to stop any naughty people trying to set it via a post.p  pRemove the Errorp  pI believe I can remove the error from the ModelState dictionary, this would be fine on this occasion, but I think this will introduce some code smell, as I would have to add this for all my objects that have private setters.  I would probably forget p  pStrongly type my view against an interfacep  pI have read that some people bind their view to an interface of their model, this is king of a ModelView interface onto the business model object.  I like this idea, but I loose the auto binding and would need to duplicate my model objects with their constructors in my web layer, not sure about that Some info on this here a hrefhttpwww.codethinked.compost20100412EasyAndSafeModelBindingInASPNETMVC.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.codethinked.compost20100412EasyAndSafeModelBindingInASPNETMVC.aspxa.p  pUse Model Viewsp  pThis just doesnt seem DRY to me  Im happy to use these if I dont have an existing model object that fits for example I use a signup Model View.p  pCustomModelBinderp  pMy preferred option, but Im not sure I know what Im doing  If I could just get the binder to only bind to properties it can set, then I would be laughingp  pWhat do people think  Comments on the above options, any other solutions, am I just off the mark with my architecturep  pThanks p

Negative 1000 pI am using R to run simulations using time series data.

I also need to be able to directly call the database from R since learning another language is not feasible now. Ideally, I would like to be able to read and write frequently to the database in a manner similar to an array though I dont know if that is realistic. I will gladly sacrifice speed for ease of use but I am willing to work to learn open source solutions. Any suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 1000 pI was always wondering about this, but never really looked thoroughly into it.p  pThe situation is like this I have a relatively large set of data instances. Each instance has the same set or properties, e.gp  precode a child instance name age height weight haircolor favoritecolor listofhobbies codepre  pUsually I would represent a child as a hash and keep all children together in a hash of hashes or an array of hashes.p  pWhat always bothered me with this approach is that I dont really use the fact that all children inner hashes have the same structure. It seems like it might be wasteful memorywise if the data is really large, so if every inner hash is stored from scratch it seems that the names of the strongkey namesstrong can take far more sapce than the data itself... Also note that when I build such data structures I often codenstorecode them to disk.p  pI wonder if creating a child strongobjectstrong makes more sense in that perspective, even though I dont really need OO. Will it be more compact Will it be faster to queryp  pOr perhaps representing each child as an array makes sense e.g.p  precodemy name, age, height, weight, haircolor, favoritecolor, listofhobbies  0..7  my childrenh     James gt [James, 12, 1.62, 73, dark brown, blue, [playing football, eating icecream]],    Norah gt [...],    Billy gt [...]  print James height is childrenhgtJames[height]n codepre  pRecall my main concerns are space efficiency RAM or disk when stored, time efficiency i.e. loading a stored dataset then getting the value of property x from instance y and ... convenience code readability etc..p  pThanksp

Negative 1000 pthis is my first question here stackoverflow.p  pIm writing a monitoring tool for some VoIP production servers, particularly a sniff tool that allows to capture all traffic VoIP calls that match a given pattern using pcap library in Perl.p  pI cannot use poor selective filters like e.g. udp and then do all the filtering in my apps code, because that would involve too much traffic and the kernel wouldnt cope reporting packet loss.p  pWhat I do then is to iteratively build the more selective filter possible during the capture. At the beginning I capture only all SIP signalling traffic and IP fragments the pattern match has to be done at application level in any case then when I find some information about RTP into SIP packets, I add or clauses to the actual filterstring with specific IP and PORT and reset the filter with setfilter.p  pSo basically something like thisp  ol lipInitial filter  udp and port 5060 or udp and ip[62] amp 0x1fff  0  captures all SIP traffic and IP fragmentspli lipUpdated filter  udp and port 5060 or udp and ip[62] amp 0x1fff  0 or host IP and port PORT  Captures also the RTP on specific IP,PORTpli lipUpdated filter  udp and port 5060 or udp and ip[62] amp 0x1fff  0 or host IP and port PORT or host IP2 and port PORT2  Captures a second RTP stream as wellpli ol  pAnd so on.p  pThis works quite well, as Im able to get the real packet loss of RTP streams for monitoring purposes, whereas with a poor selective filter version of my tool, the RTP packet loss percentage wasnt reliable because there was some packets missing due to packet drop by kernel.p  pBut lets get to the drawback of this approach.p  pCalling setfilter while capturing involves the fact that libpcap drops packets received while changing the filter as stated in code comments for function setkernelfilter into pcaplinux.c checked libpcap version 0.9 and 1.1.p  pSo what happens is that when I call setfilter and some packets arrive IPfragmented, I do loose some fragments, and this is not reported by libpcap statistics at the end I spotted it digging into traces.p  pNow, I understand the reason why this action is done by libpcap, but in my case I definitely need not to have any packet drop I dont care about getting some unrelated traffic.p  pWould you have any idea on how to solve this problem that is not modifying libpcaps code p

Negative 1000 pIm not sure the title is the best possible, but I cant think of something perfectly descriptive. Here is my scenario.p  pI have to build a web portal which will employ all the bells and whistles offered by ajax and javascript, while still accessible and functional to users who may not have javascript, andor are using legacy systems. As I see it I have two paths I can take.p  ol lipProgressive Enhancement with this approach well have one set of markup, it will serve as a fully functional classic html portal. The clientside library will then enhance the existing markup to override html functionality and supersede it with the advanced javascript functionality.pli lipThe second idea is to have two client libraries, one for the javascript enabled portal, and one for the classic HTML.pli ol  pThere are pros and cons that I see.p  ol lipThe first scenario keeps a smaller footprint for maintainability. We have one set of markup, there are no duplications or synchronization issues. The negatives I see here are the code can get muddled having to do double duty, and can be more easily corrupted.pli lipThe second scenario is good in that each portal aspect can be optimized to its needs. Obviously maintaining two sets of code will bring plenty of maintenance issues.pli ol  pI am currently leaning towards scenario 1, but scenario 2 has some positives I like, such as ease of adding a third option.

Negative 1000 pIm running the LazyLoad script for my website and having an issue with one small aspect of it.p  pIm using Lazy Load on a Horizontal scroll left to right with fairly wide images. The script works perfectly and fades in within 200px or whatever the default is. p  pHowever I noticed if the window is opened to a smaller size, then opened to full window, the placeholder, Lazy Load has only the image loaded that was In View during the smaller window size. It loads once the scroll bar is moved, but Im curious if theres any scripting I could add along the lines When the window resizes, regauge the viewing spacep  pHopefully this makes sense. I know very little about JavaScript so if anyone knows how to solve this feel free to respond as if you were talking to a 5 year old with step by step instructions p

Negative 1000 pIm about to submit my app. Its plays some radio streams. And displays some info from my web server.p  p1It does a check when the app starts for reachability and informs the user if there no connection available. Do i need to do more here, like keep popping up alerts if the user starts trying to play the radio even if there is no connection Or checking once when the app starts enough  Maybe I would be expected to check on every button thats pressed that tries to play a radio station or that tries to download some data from the web server Incase there is web connectivity when the apps starts but its later lostp  p2 The app can play the radio streams in the background. Is there anything special related to this that I am expected to handle. If the app is interrupted by a phone call am I expected to make the radio resume automatically after the call or is it ok to leave that up to the user The volume control on the side of the phone is ok to control the volume. I havent hooked any other buttons from the phone itself to the app. Is this okp  p3 If there is anything else you think I should look into handling please feel free to suggest it. p  pMany Thanks Codep
Negative 1000 pThe standard idiom for codepthreadatforkcode usage is supposed to be to obtain all locks in the prefork handler, and release them in both the parent and child handlers. However as far as I can tell, this is impossible. codepthreadmutexunlockcode is specified to either have undefined behavior in the case of normal or default type mutexes or to fail in the case of recursive or errorchecking mutexes if the calling thread is not the owner of the mutex. And in the child handler registered with codepthreadatforkcode, the calling thread is the main thread of the newly created process, and thus emcannot beem the owner of the mutex.p  pAm I mistaken or is the whole codepthreadatforkcode idiom broken by design and essentially impossible to usep  pstrongEditstrong I also fail to see any valid portable workaround for the issue. Ideally one could just destroy and reinitialize the mutexes in the child process, except that calling codepthreadmutexdestroycode on an initialized mutex is specified as undefined behavior in order to accommodate ridiculous implementations where mutexes are not POD but involve a reference to some kernellevel object.p

Negative 1000 pIve been doing some work recently that analyzes relationships between various projects in source control. So far Ive been using PowerShell and XPath through the SelectXml cmdlet to process our csproj files, however this relies on my tenuous knowledge of how MSBuild uses the ProjectReference and Reference elements in the project files. It dawned on me that it would be much better if I could use MSBuild itself to resolve the references and then somehow inspect the results of the reference resolution process. p  pMSBuild experts does this seem possible Would this entail writing a custom targets file or something Would I be forced into also building the projects as well since csproj files also import Microsoft.CSharp.targetsp  pAny insight would be nice.

Negative 1000 pI want to install or at least, do the prepairing for the installing of a USB driver after my software is installed on the client computer.p  pI have a small program, written in C in Visual Studio 2008, and I can install the program using the standard feature in VS2008. This program talks to a hardware device via USB cable. The USB driver is came from ftdi and can be installed when user plugs it in the USB socket. This works fine, but I want the file to be copied during the installation of the software. Once this is done, show message on screen e.g. Please plug in your USB cable in to the socket and click OK to continue, on which the installing of the driver is automatically carried out from that moment. The same as when you install the software for a new printer.p  pPlease advice how I can do it. And its great if you can help me start with some examples.p  pGreat thanks, Henry.p

Negative 1000 pI have a VB6 application that does a directory listing of a folder and picks up the filenames. Some of these are accented, for example Guimares.txt small A with a tilde. Both the VB Dir function, and FileSystemObject functions are unable to recognise the accented character, and instead return the filename as Guimares.pdf, so I am subsequently unable to open the file. I can see the file correctly in Windows Explorerp  pThis is only happening in one live environment, running Windows Server 2003 R2. On our test systems, we can read the file correctly, though these are mainly Windows 2008 and Windows 7. I initially thought it was down to the version of FSO, but as Dir gives the same results, I no longer think so. Also, when I write the name of the file to a log file, it is also incorrect. So I think that at a very early stage it is unable to handle the character, and replaces it with a question mark. p  pWhat I need to establish is the cause of the issue is it down to the version of Windows, or my regional settings which I am unable to view, as my account is locked down, and what can I do to resolve the problem. For now, Ive asked the users not to use these characters, but this is not a longterm solution. p  pThanks.p

The service also needs to be SOAP.p  pIve read through most posts that have anything to do with python and SOAP and tried out pretty much all the different libraries, but most of them just seem over my head especially ZSISOAPpy.  The Ladon Library seems like it would be best and simplest for what I need, but the tutorial a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvDJYjEBedk4ampfeaturefeedlik relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvDJYjEBedk4ampfeaturefeedlika loses me at 510 when he brings it to the server.  When I type the ladon2.6ctl in the cmd, it seems like windows gets quite confused.  Im guessing it is a little different because he is running on Linux and using Apache.p  pWith that, any tips on how to get a python web service running on Microsoft stuff would be greatly appreciated, as I have been trying to figure this stuff out for way too long.p  pOne thing to note is the reason things are so specific and seemingly strange is because the scripts I have do a lot of geoprocessing with ESRIs arcpy.p  pAdditionp  precodeTraceback on localhost8080TestService Traceback most recent call last   ltbrgtFile cPython26ArcGIS10.0libsitepackagesladon0.5.1py2.6.eggladonserverwsgiapplication.py, line 229, in call     execimport s  ,.joinself.servicelist   File ltstringgt, line 1, in ltmodulegt   File cUsersrworkspaceladonsrctestspace.py, line 3, in ltmodulegt     class TestService2object   File cUsersrworkspaceladonsrctestspace.py, line 4, in TestService2     ladonizeint,int,rtypeint   File cPython26ArcGIS10.0libsitepackagesladon0.5.1py2.6.eggladonladonizerdecorator.py, line 87, in decorator     ladonmethodinfo  globalservicecollection.addservicemethodf,defargs,defkw   File cPython26ArcGIS10.0libsitepackagesladon0.5.1py2.6.eggladonladonizercollection.py, line 119, in addservicemethod     sinfo  self.sourceinfosrcfname   File cPython26ArcGIS10.0libsitepackagesladon0.5.1py2.6.eggladonladonizercollection.py, line 79, in sourceinfo     a  ast.parsesrc   File cPython26ArcGIS10.0libast.py, line 37, in parse     return compileexpr, filename, mode, PyCFONLYAST   File ltunknowngt, line 1      from ladon.ladonizer import ladonize    SyntaxError invalid syntax codepre  psample codep  precodefrom ladon.ladonizer import ladonize  class TestService2object     ladonizeint,int,rtypeint     def sumself,a,b         add two numbersltbrgt         param a number 1         param b number 2         rtype sum of result                  return ab codepre
Negative 1000 pstrongWhat is the best way to insert rows into tables with references 1 to 1 of each otherstrongp  pI mean, in a MySQL 5.5 and tables InnoDB, I have a database design similar to the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNfzbU.png altenter image description herep  pThe problem arises when we try to insert rows in table1 and table2. Since there is no multitable insert in MySQL, I can not insert a row becouse the foreign keys are NOT NULL fields in both tables and should be inserted simultaneously in both.p  pWhich is the bes way to solve this problemp  pI have in mind 3 possible solutions, but I want to know if there are more than these or which is the best and why.p  ol lipSet the foreign key field as NULLABLE and after insert one row in a table, insert the other one and afterwards, update de first one.pli lipJust as indicated above but with an special value like 1. First, insert in one table with foreign codekey  1code that is equivalent to NULL but avoiding set the field as NULLABLE. Afterwards, we insert the row in the other table and update the first one inserted.pli lipCreate a relational table between both though it is not really necessary because it is a 1 to 1 ratiopli ol  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I briefly explain what I need this circular relationship It is a denormalization from the parent table to one of its childs. It is made in order of high performance to have always the reference of the best ranked child from a parent table.p

Negative 1000 pIf I use a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibrarysocket.htmlsocket.socket.makefile relnofollowsocket.makefilea and then close the file object as well as the underlying socket, then subsequent calls to codereadcode will throw an exception, just as Id want it to.  For example, the following code works as Id expectp  precodeimport socket from time import sleep from threading import Thread  ADDR  localhost, 4321  def listenersock     client,addr  sock.accept     sleep1     client.close     sock.close  serversock  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM serversock.setsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET, socket.SOREUSEADDR, 1 serversock.bindADDR serversock.listen1 Threadtargetlistener, args[serversock].start  sock  socket.createconnectionADDR f  sock.makefilerb, bufsize0  f.close sock.close f.read8     throws an exception, as Id expect codepre  pHowever, if I make a call to codereadcode while the filesocket are still open then that call will block, and bthenb if I close the socket, the read method still doesnt return.  In fact, it hangs indefinitely until the socket is closed on the other end.  The following code demonstrates this distressing behaviorp  precodeimport socket from time import sleep from threading import Thread  ADDR  localhost, 4321  def readerf     printabout to read     printwe read r  f.read8     printfinished reading  def listenersock     client, addr  sock.accept     sleep3     client.close     sock.close  serversock  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM serversock.setsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET, socket.SOREUSEADDR, 1 serversock.bindADDR serversock.listen1 Threadtargetlistener, args[serversock].start  sock  socket.createconnectionADDR f  sock.makefilerb, bufsize0 Threadtargetreader, args[f].start  sleep1 printclosing pseudofile and socket f.close sock.close sleep1 printwe still havent finished reading codepre  pThis is a serious problem for me, since Id like to make a blocking call to codef.readcode in a thread, but then still be able to close the socket and have the thread return from that call possibly by throwing an exception and exit.  However, all that happens is that the call blocks forever so long as the other side never closes the socket.p  pSo is there any way for codeThread1code to call codereadcode on the filelike object created by codesocket.makefilecode and then have codeThread2code shut down the socket in a way that causes codeThread1code to stop blocking on its codereadcode callp  pbEDITb I tried rewriting my program to entirely use codegeventcode and its socket and Greenlet approach to multithreading, but my program still does exactly the same thingp  precodefrom gevent import sleep, socket, spawn  ADDR  localhost, 4321  def readerf     printabout to read     printwe read r  f.read8     printfinished reading  def listenersock     client, addr  sock.accept     sleep3     client.close     sock.close  serversock  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM serversock.setsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET, socket.SOREUSEADDR, 1 serversock.bindADDR serversock.listen1 spawnlistener, serversock  sock  socket.createconnectionADDR f  sock.makefilerb, bufsize0 spawnreader, f  sleep1 printclosing pseudofile and socket f.close sock.close  sleep1 printwe still havent finished reading sleep2 codepre  pI was surprised to learn that even using codegeventcode sockets, calls to codereadcode will block even after the underlying socket is closed.

In the portfolio the 3 big images at the bottom have had their black points shifted and they still get white dots.pli lipapparently, setting the background colour of the parent div box to black will also solve the problem. this seemed to work for me if I set the background of .photos to black but this makes half the screen black as well. But setting the background of the DIV which contains the picture .photo did not help. If there is a way that we can get this to work, this would be a suitable solution. I cant get it to work for me .pli ul  pstrongSo where to from herestrong I can turn off the transitionsfadein etc in ISOTOPE by setting animationEngine  CSS. This effectivley means that if the browser supports CSS3 then the CSS will be used for the transitions, but if not, the browser will not revert to using javascript to do the transitions. However, this means that there is no transition on the page on IE, which looks pants.p  pstrongIdeally I need to fix the white spot issue.strong   any suggestions on how i might be able to get ISOTOPE to refresh the images after a filter  maybe there is another way I can do the transitions  is it possible to remove the fadeinfadeout, but still use a transform of some sort so that I still have some animation happening in IEp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. I have been tearing my hair out all weekend trying to get this to work, with no success. p  pstrongUPDATE 892011strong I managed to find a way to turn off the fade transition, however, the javascript filter that I am using still sets the opacity to 0 to hide the image, and this is actually causing the white spot issue to occour. So I really need to find a way to get the background colour to be set to black so that it hides the transparent pixels. p

Negative 1000 pWe have a webapplication where  amongst other things  an detailed archive of logdata from embedded devices is kept. We want to keep this detailed data for internal analysis, but this data is not needed on the public accessible production server for longer than three months. The webapplication only inserts new data, there are no updates or deletes on the detailed data.p  pSo we want to build an archive system which gets regularly e.g. daily a copy of the new data from the production server including the last three months and then all data older then three months is removed from the production server.p  pUnfortunately sometimes some of our embedded devices are offline for some time days to weeks. In this case it could happen that new data is added to the system for an already copiedarchived time.p  pOn the public production server we are using SQL Server 2008 Standard Edition, on the internal archive system we want to use SQL Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition to benefit from partitioning and compression for the archive.p  pAt the moment I am considering the following approachesp  ol lipDaily replication of data from production to archive system. When old data on production is deleted this should not be replicated to the archive system. I found an option to ignore delete operations on the replication target.pli lipIf there was not the requirement to also have the current data on the archive system I regularly would move all data older than a specific time to the archive system. But I have to synchronize the current data and move all old data.p  pMaybe I have to use a mixed solution Replication for synchronizing the current data between archive and production system and moving of old data to an archive table on the archive system while replicating the deletes for the archived data from the current table to the production system.pli ol  pWhat do you think Do you have some recommendations or know some best practices regarding such problems Is this topic covered elsewhere e.g. booksp  pThank you very much in advance.p  pPS I am not sure if this question should be asked here or on serverfault.

Negative 1000 pI wrote a sql join query in oracle with two table. While writing query I did not use any table alias to refer column in select clause. Now this was possible because the selected columns were having different names in both the tables.p  pSo the question follows is it necessary from performance point of view to use a table alias to select column regardless there is any similar column name in both the tables p  pPlease note Right now I am under impression that In case of join query when we do not specify table alias to select column oracle will always lookup the table metadata to find out which table has this column. strongemSo is my assumption trueemstrongp  pThanks, hanumantp

Negative 1000 pI am working on a asp.net web application that has is a part of TFS and is used by the development team. Recently as part of the project we setup ADFS and are now attempting to enforce authentication of the project to an ADFS server. p  pOn my development machine I have gone through the steps of adding STS reference which generates the  Federation MetaData as well as updates the web.config file for the project. Authorization within the web.config uses thumbprint certification which requires me to add to my local machine the ADFS certificate as well as generate a signed certificate for the dev machine and add this to ADFS. p  pAll is setup and working but in looking at the web.config. and FederationMetadata.xml document these appear to be machine specific. I suspect that if I check the projectfiles into TFS the next developer or tester that takes a build will end up with a broken build on their machine. p  pMy question is within TFS what is the process for a scenario like this to check in and still allow my team to check out, build, and test the project with the latest code in their development or test environments  p  pMy work around at this time is to exclude the FederationMetaData.xml and web.config from check in then on each development machine manually setup ADFS authentication as well as for product test. Once done each person can prevent their local copy of the FederationMetatData.xml and web.config from being checked in.aka have their own local copy then when checking inout just ensure that each developer preserves their own copy or does not check them into TFSp  pThis seems extremely inefficient, and all but bypasses the essence of source code management as developers are being required to keep local copies of files on their machine. This also seems to introduce the opportunity for accidental checkin of local files or overwriting local files.  p  pDoes anyone have any references, documentation or information on how to checkin code for ADFS machine specific configurations and not hose up the entire development environment p  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 1000 pIs it possible to create a default theme for an ASP.NET Websitep  pFor example, If I had a theme called codeDefaultcode, and ive selected a theme called codeNewThemecode and I referenced a file which doesnt exist in the codeNewThemecode but does exist in the codeDefaultcode theme likep  precodeltaspimage idimg runatserver ImageUrlImagesimage.jpg gt codepre  pCould that then be taken from codeAppThemesDefaultImagesimage.jpgcode if it does not exist at codeAppThemesNewThemeImagesimage.jpgcodep  pFurthermore if a CSS class didnt exist in NewTheme, but it did in Default, then could it take the Default In fact, I think it would be better if it first took all the default styles, and then overrides any that NewTheme have which clashes.p  pI know Global References work similar to this because if ive selected codeescode localization, and a key doesnt exist in the codewebreference.resx.escode file but it does in codewebreference.resxcode, then itll take the value from there.p  pI think this would be important functionality for ASP.NET Themes as I can imagine different themes only having certain images changed, and certain styles changed. I cant imagine every image and every style always being totally different for each Theme. And therefore without this functionality, its going to be a case of duplicating stylesimages, which Im not a fan of for obvious reasons.p

Negative 1000 pstrongThe Situationstrongp  pI need to support generating XML documents based on schemas that vary only slightly between each other. Specifically, the schemas that I need to support are based on industry standards that change slightly over time and vendors may make their own customized version of them.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pI was intending to use JAXB 2 from Metro with inheritance as a solution. I expected the package structure to end up something like thisp  precode    com.company.xml.schema.v1     com.company.xml.schema.v2     com.company.xml.schema.v2.vendorxyz codepre  pWhere the classes in the v2 package would simply extend the classes in the v1 package and override as necessary. Unfortunately, that plan ended up being impossible since subclasses cannot overwrite the annotations in parent classes a hrefhttpbugs.sun.combugdatabaseviewbug.dobugid6516905see herea. For example, if an attribute in a schema was renamed between versions, then the v2 element class would have to completely reimplement the element without inheriting from the v1.p  pSo that leaves me with only two options as far as I can tellp  pemOption 1emp  pCreate a base package for each schema type, annotate the element classes in that package with XmlAccessorTypeXmlAccessType.NONE, and remove all other annotations. Then, in each versioned package create classes that subclass the corresponding class in the base package and add all the required annotations. This solution does give me a little help in the inheritance realm, but code duplication is huge and it would be a challenge to maintain.p  pemOption 2emp  pDont use JAXB. I really dont like this solution since Id also like to work with JAXRSJAXWS.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul liHow should I be using JAXB in order to support multiple schemas with minor variations, without a bunch of code duplicationli liIs there a different technology combination I should be looking atli ul  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe solution below from Blaise worked perfectly for most of our schemas which were just a minor translation of each other with generally the same data. However, we ran into a problem  in cases where it made more sense to use inheritance with package names for versioning. For Examplep  precodecom.company.xml.schema.v1.ElementA com.company.xml.schema.v2.ElementA codepre  pwhere v2.ElementA extends v1.ElementAp  pUsing MOXys OXM in this case stumbles across a bug and the workaround can be found a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgforumsindex.phpm667868herea with the solution provided by Blaise, no lessp

The identifiers may not be exactly identical each time they come with HTTP request therefore I use fuzzy string comparison to authenticate the user. For that very reason, I couldnt hash the identifier because my fuzzy string comparison algorithm wont work with the hashed values since even slightly different plain texts yield completely different values when hashed.

Negative 1000 pIm writing an application that uses the Stanford CoreNLP library among many other library.

Negative 1000 pWe are doing some load testing on a PHP Kohana application.

My understanding is that each PHP request creates one thread, it shouldnt be creating processes, especially not 4.

Negative 1000 pIs it possible to have a secure piece of Javascript code in a web application  By emsecureem I mean that we can do things like query the server for permissions, and do operations that cannot be altered by the client  p  pExamplep  precode    var flag  0      .ajax         async false,         url checkpermissionscript.php,         success functiondata             flag  parseIntdata                    if flag  1         displaynormalcontent     else         displaysecurecontent      codepre  pHere I want to make a query to the server to check if the user has permission to see the secure content.  If they have the permissions, then we use codedisplaysecurecontentcode to show them the secure content, if not, we use codedisplaynormalcontentcode to display normal content.  The problem is, that via a debugging terminal, it is easy to set the codeflagcode variable  1 on the client computer, or just call the codedisplaysecurecontentcode function directly.p  pMy motivation for doing things this way is to have nice web app that uses ajax to get new content, without having to reload the page.  I like this instead of having to reload the page.p  pSo the question is, can we have JS scripts that are secure against client manipulation  Or is this simply impossible by the nature of the web infrastructurep  pThanksp

Im trying to integrate delayedjob into my project, and running into trouble getting rake to recognize jobswork.  Yes, I know delayedjob typically works with rails, but as I understand it can work without it. p  pSo far, Ive installed the delayedjob 3.0.3 and delayedjobactiverecord 0.3.2 gems using my gemfilebundler.  Because I dont have rails, I created my own migration file from the delayedjob readme, and migrated it.  I dont think any of this should be causing my issue.p  pFrom all the docs Ive seen, installing the gems should do the trick. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling them, to no avail.  Im not sure what else to try  perhaps theres something I need to explicitly include in my rakefile, but I havent seen any docs that indicate that.  p  pAny help greatly appreciated.  p

Negative 1000 pI would like to ask you guys if you could review a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comykvhY.png relnofollowmy database designa. I think it is quite selfexplanatory, but to be absolutely clearp  pMy goal is to make an application which has a super flexible user management which is why the groups are in treeform and the groups and users have a habtm relationship and a super modular way to build pages which is why the pages consist of widgetblocks.p  pThe reason I made users and profiles separate is because the users table will not change and is only needed for authentication and authorization. However, the profiles table will change according to the wishes of the client. So it might not have a signature, but an avatar field instead. Or maybe it will be completely empty  not exist at all.p  pA widget could be anything, it could be a poll, it could be a piece of content, it could be a navigation, it could be a collection of comments, whatever.p  pThe reason I chose to make subdomains, locales and layouts separate tables instead of just putting the names into pages is because I want to limit the options that are available to the client. Just because I have a threecolumns.ctp in my layouts folder doesnt necessarily mean I want the client to be able to choose it.p  pSame goes for the widgets. And besides limiting choice, not every plugin, controller and action in my pluginsfolder is a widget, so I need a table to clarify which are.p  pA block is a widget on a page which sits in a container e.g. the right column in a 3 column layout at a particular position which is decided by the index lower index means higher.p  pSo thats my explanation, what do you guys think Is this as good as it can be Or do you have a suggestions to make it even more flexible and modular.p  p[edit] Oh and to be clear, the widgets will of course have their own tables to store the information they need to store.p

Negative 1000 pMVVM is based on bindings and commands. I understand that bindings for codeIsEnabledcode, codeIsReadOnlycode, codeVisibilitycode and commands codeCanExecutecode can help to implement GUI which will take permissions into account.br Yet I have some doubts about this approach.p  pThe first one is the need to accompany each ACLlogic involved property of VM with codeCanReadcode  codeCanWritecode property that can be bound to the corresponding control. This implies much infrustructure coding and XAML typing for bindings. Dynamic tooltips explaining the reason also can be added to the list.p  pThe second one is that mistyping in XAML can break security especially concerning read permissions control will stay visible. This problem can be solved in mostnot all cases by the Busines Logic layer which leaves properties with deafult values. But on the way back VMBL system must care only about allowed properties.p  pSecurity is dubbed a crosscutting concern. I understand how AOP or DI with interception can help with security at BL level but I have no good ideas about implementing all this stuff for GUI in the context of MVVM design pattern.p  pCould you share your experience of solving this problem, please.p

Negative 1000 pIf we take a database table, we can query all the rows or we can choose to apply a filter on it. The filter can vary depending on the user input. In cases when there are few options we can specify different queries for those few specific conditions.

I know, I can compose the filter based upon the user input and send it as a string to the corresponding stored procedure as a parameter, build the query with that filter and finally execute the query string with the help of EXECUTE IMMEDIATEIn Oracles case.

But this only happens if spork is running. The quick fix was to coderequire foopresentercode in a file in configinitializers, but is there a cleaner solution that doesnt need the explicit require My guess is the issue here is that Rails doesnt autoload libpresentersfoopresenter.rb because PresentersFooPresenter has already been defined by barspec.rb.p

Negative 1000 pI am trying to build a parallel algorithim that will display the least number of steps you need to solve a maze. Max is the maximum amount of steps you are allowed to take and changes everytime the algorithim finds a destination. The maze is 15 x 6 so max is initialized as 90. If one instance of the program finds it in 50 steps, the new max is now 50. However in this instance, max freezes at 88, and the steps it takes to get to the destination oscillate around 88.

Negative 1000 pIm working on creating a 2D game for fun to learn some of the ins and outs of multiplayer gaming. The game itself will pit two players armies against each other in a strategic turn based battle. I am developing it as a standalone desktop client then maybe a phone app eventually.p  pI am writing the game in Java and I am not trusting the client, so I am taking security into account. The players will have an personal account with their army lists and stuff that will live on the server as well.  Additionally, I plan on using mySQL to store this sort of data on the server.p  pIm not really sure how to implement this, however. Do I use something like a webserver This seems wrong, but I dont know what technologies to use for a Java front end and backend where the client is untrusted.  Note that Im not looking for a debate about the best way to do this, I just need to know the concepts, maybe some example technologies, and maybe a link to a tutorial. p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 1000 pIm having difficulties handling 404 errors correctly in ColdFusion 10 on Windows 2008 R2 x64 using a custom error handler Execute URL in IIS. Ive done this in previous versions of CF with no problems. In IIS, under the web site features, I open Error Pages and set it to execute 404.cfm for all 404 errors.p  pThe problem Im having is that the output of the 404.cfm page is not completely being sent back to the browser and the page doesnt load correctly. Sometimes I get nothing back, other times I get 1K, other times I get a little bit more. Its very inconsistent.p  pAlong with setting the 404.cfm handler in IIS, I am also calling it in the onMissingTemplate method inside Application.cfmp  precodeltcffunction nameonMissingTemplate     returnTypeboolean     outputtruegt      ltcfargument namethePage typestring requiredtruegt      ltcftrygt          ltcfmodule template......404.cfm thePageArguments.thePagegt          ltcfcatchgt             ltcfoutputgtltpgtAn error occurredltpgtltcfoutputgt         ltcfcatchgt      ltcftrygt      ltcfreturn true gt ltcffunctiongt codepre  pInside my strong404.cfmstrong error handler, Im callingp  precodeltcfheader statuscode404 statustextNot Foundgt codepre  p... and then I output a bunch of stuff.p  pWhen I remove the call to cfheader in 404.cfm, the error handler loads correctly [for ColdFusion requests]. Thats because nothing is going through IIS  instead, its simply going through the onMissingTemplate method in ColdFusion. However, the response header gives me a 200 status code, which is a problem It needs to be a 404 status code for obvious reasons.p  pWhen I include the cfheader call, strongORstrong when a nonColdFusion page is being requested IIS will generate the 404 status code, the output of my 404.cfm handler is not completely returned to the browser.

I want the users of my app to have two options.p  p1 They can choose pictures from Galleryp  p2 They can capture a new photo from camerap  pHere is how Im accomplishing the aforementioned two tasksp  precodeButton takePhotoFromCameraButton Button chooseFromGalleryButton   String imagePath  Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory.getAbsolutePath  System.currentTimeMillis  image.jpg File imageFile  new FileimagePath imageUri  Uri.fromFileimageFile codepre  pIn both buttons, Im passing the same onClickListner.p  precode    Override public void onClickView clickedView       int clickedViewId  clickedView.getId      switchclickedViewId          case R.id.takeFromCamera             Intent imageCaptureIntent  new Intentandroid.provider.MediaStore.ACTIONIMAGECAPTURE             imageCaptureIntent.putExtraandroid.provider.MediaStore.EXTRAOUTPUT, imageUri             startActivityForResultimageCaptureIntent,0             break         case R.id.chooseFromGallery             Intent choosePictureIntent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONPICK, android.provider.MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNALCONTENTURI             startActivityForResultchoosePictureIntent, 1             break         default              As we have only two buttons, and nothing else can be clicked except the buttons. So no need to put              code in the DEFAULT CASE       codepre  pAnd Im capturing the result from both, the following wayp  precode    protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent      super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, intent      switchrequestCode          case 0             Intent cameraIntent  new IntentMainOptionsActivity.this,ApplyEffectsActivity.class             cameraIntent.putExtraimageFileUri, imageUri             startActivitycameraIntent             break         case 1             Uri imageUriForGallery  intent.getData             Intent galleryIntent  new IntentMainOptionsActivity.this,ApplyEffectsActivity.class             galleryIntent.putExtraimageFileUri, imageUriForGallery             startActivitygalleryIntent             break        codepre  pp  pThe button for gallery images works fine. But when I invoke camera by pressing the second button and capture the image, nothing happens. It stays there till I cancel the camera and come back to my app. I dont receive any image back Where Im wrong Dont mind this silly question, Im just a beginner in android p

Im currently trying to reconfigure gridster to not render the content when dragging, or for another widget solution that behaves fluently on the iPad, even when more complex content is dragged. Any suggestionsp  pA related point Would CSS3 transitions a way to optimize this, because as I understand them, they are hardware supported and dont rely on JavaScript for rendering Or are they not suited for small, realtime movements that are calculated on the fly. p

Negative 1000 pAs Apple has decided to forbid the use of UDID i need a way to uniquely identify my users in my application.p  pI also need a way that even when the user deletes the application and then decides to install it again that unique identifier will remain the same.p  pI decided that the way , is when the application contacts my server , the server returns a unique identifier , which the application stores in the Key Chain of the device. This way , as far as i understand , even when the app gets deleted the identifier will remain there and the next time the user installs the app , he will continue to have the same identifier.p  pAlso in case of an update , the identifier wont be lost.p  pMy questionsp  p1 Are my thoughts correct Does the Key Chain work like this strongIFstrong i understood well what i ve read i would say everything should work , but from the other side seems a bit strange that i could save emANYTHINGem i want in someones devices key chain and keep it there forever even when he uninstalls the app.p  p2 Which is the easiest library you can suggest me to use for accessing the KeyChain p

Negative 1000 pIm using Delphi XE4 Architect Delphi Xe3 is ok as well I need to find a smart solution to the following problem and I would like to use one of these frameworks kbmMW or RemOjects SDK  DataAbstract or RealThinClientp  pCurrently I have an application using a very simple MSSQL database on a site A that is used by users of a site B through the remote desktop. The application sometimes needs to show some pictures and also view some PDF, but it is mostly text data entry.p  pThere is no particular reason for me to use MSSQL, but it is a database that I found already active and populated and I have not built it myself.  And now, it would be complicated to change it. Database is not important, not using specific features nor stored procedures nor triggersp  pUsers of the Site B are connected to the A site via a network connection very slow  and occasionally the connection is not available for a few hours and up to one day this is the major problem. The situation of the connection, unfortunately, can not be improved for various reasons.p  pThe database is quite simple has many tables that hardly ever change, about ten instead undergo daily updates and potentially they may be subject to competing changes.p  pMainly the records of these tables contain data that are locked in update from a single user to edit some fields and then he saves releasing the lock.p  pI would like to get something very different to optimize performance.p  pUsers of the A site have higher priority, they are more important, because the A site is the headquarters.p  pI would like to have a copy of the database at Site A to Site B, so that users of site B can work in local, much faster without using the remote desktop connecting to the site A. The RDP protocol is not very optimized and in any case if the connection is absent, users could not work.p  pSynchronize and update databases lock records between the two databases may not be a big problem.p  pBasically when a user of the Site B acquires edit a record in the database B, obviously a user of the site A should not be able to modify the same record on the database of the site A.  This should also work in the opposite direction of course.p  pMy big problem is figuring out how handling to the best the situation that occurs when the connection between B and A is not available for some hours. And transactionevents is increasing on site B. Events on Site A have generally priority on collision on events on Site B. p  pUsers of the Site B must be able to continue working.  When the connection becomes active, the changes should be sent to the database at Site A. Obviously this can result in conflicts, but the changes made on the record possibly by users B can be discarded or it can be done under the supervision of a selective merge and approval record by record user of the site B.p  pWell, I hope the scenario is almost explained clearly.p  pAdditional infosp  ul lipDB schema is very simple, only tables, no triggers, stored procedure. So I can build one as example but imagine 10 tables that can be updated in concurrency.pli lipDB is used by a desktop app of sales departement, so it contains most secret data.pli lipRemote connection is typically max 512Kbit, but the main problem here is that the connection sometimes may be not active and user on remote site must work anyway.

The problem is I dont know how to do this.p  pFirst problem is that when I rotate the device, the textView takes up the entire grey area, the entire view. The textView was set up in interface builder in a storyboard and I made no setting or indication that I wanted this behavior. It just happens. This is not what I want. The textView is set up in interface builder, so the only checkmark I see is Autoresize Subviews. Im assuming this behavior is autoresizing so I uncheck that, and still nothing. I assume because it only applies to its subviews. So I go to the UINavigationController and uncheck its Navigation Bars Autoresize Subviews. Still nothingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4urhz.png altenter image description herep  pThe only thing that kind of works is if I reset the textViews frame in the codedidRotateFromInterfaceOrientationcode method. Sure this works, but this isnt what I want. Because first, once the device rotates to landscape, the textView still stretches. Its not until the rotation animation is over that the textView snaps into the size and position I want. And second, if the app starts up in landscape, the textView is still stretched. The resetting of the textViews frame only happens for a rotation.p  pSummary  How can I set the frame for a view for specific orientations p

Negative 1000 pI have an codeActivitycode with multiple codeFragmentcodes. I want to show a codeDialogFragmentcode or open another codeFragmentcode from one of the codeFragmentcodes. I know that an codeActivitycode should be the one tasked with opening codeFragmentcodes so instead I have tried a couple things.p  pstrongFIRSTstrongbr I tried to use codegetActivitycode and cast it so I can call a method in the codeActivitycode to show a codeFragmentcode however this creates a dependency in the codeFragmentcode with the codeActivitycode and I would like to avoid adding a dependency if possible.brbr strongSECONDstrongbr Next I tried a listener to notify the codeActivitycode that it should show a codeFragmentcode. So I created a class in the codeActivitycode to implement the listener interface. But I had problems because I had to use codeNew MyActivity.new Listenercode and it would throw an codeExceptioncode when I tried to use codegetSupportFragmentManagercode since this instance of the codeActivitycode is not initialized.brbr strongTHIRDstrongbr I then tried to have the codeActivitycode implement the listener directly which works because then I am only creating a dependency with the listener and not the Activity. However now I am getting to the point where my codeActivitycode will be implementing 2  4 different interfaces which is making me hesitant because it will severely reduce cohesion.brbrp  pSo any way I have tried I seem to be running into a brick wall and creating dependancies Im not sure I need to be creating. Am I screwed and have to go with one of these options If so which option would be best Any help or suggestions are are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1000 pI need to identify node pairs in my graph where there exists more than one path between the nodes. I am not looking for a particular pair of nodes, just any pair of nodes with multiple paths between them would be fine for me. So I dont want to get ALL such pairs but just some. I would like to use Cypher for that. This sounds like an easy task, but I dont find the proper query. I didnt even find a way to tell how many paths there are between two nodes in Cypher.p  pI hope someone can give me a hint. It is no problem when the query would run a while.p  pThanksp

Negative 1000 pOkay, we talk and hear lot about creating mobile app using javascript and html. I was trying to write one app myself forgetting that some real programs also need to store and access at least, the information stored by the program. I intend to user only the browser of the mobile app and it is offline. Basically, it is just a program written using js. Since the browser is not allowed to create and store the data in the users disk, how should I approach it Storing the data in cookies is one of the option, I guess. I am new to web programming so please bear with me if I say something stupid. However, cookies can be inadvertently deleted. p  pSo my question is How can I manage a small storage space in mobile device if I am using a html and js to create my appp

Negative 1000 pI have multiple publishsubscribe servers that attempt to update a MongoDB database as events occur. Currently I am running into an issue where I need to atomically add entries to a given MongoDB document array, but am running into a race condition when it comes to who adds the entry into the document.

One of the classes, a directional graph, has a method for adding an edge between two nodes in a graph.

Whenever I try to use that method, I get the error listed in the title codeThe type VertexNotFoundException could not be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class filescode. I added the jar to my project by going through Build PathConfigure Build PathLibrariesAdd External Jar and selecting this jar.

Negative 1000 pA website Im working on uses xml files for each page rather than php or html files. The xml is converted to html soon html5 via xslt on the client side. I intend to make these pages usefully semantic and I was interested in how search engines see the page.p  pSince a human on the site sees the URL as www.example.comwebpage.xml, I assume that the page is being processed by search engines as xml too, rather than the result of the xslt conversion. Is this truep  pIf this is true, do I even care about html5 microdata Would I instead be adding semantics to my xml document What languages would be appropriate for this p  pFinally, what about the meta tags in the head of html pages Do I not care about those either as theyd result from the xslt and would therefore be ignoredp  pI hope that all seems logical.p  pThanks,p  pPatrick.p

Negative 1000 pIm trying to decode an h264encoded video frame using a decoder that has fairly limited capabilities a hrefhttpsgithub.commbebenitaBroadway relnofollowBroadway JSa.p  pHeres the process Im using for testingp  ol liEncode single image using h264 output is 62KB using OpenH264 from Cisco, write to diskli liRead file as binary in JS loaded via XHRli liDecode in JS using Broadwayli liDisplay in canvasli ol  pI actually have a functional example of this, but theres a manual step at the moment between steps 1 and 2  I have to call FFMPEG to force a small translation, and I cant figure out why.p  pI have successfully integrated Ciscos Openh264 library into my project, and can encode the image as h264 and write it to disk. Ive confirmed the encoding itself is valid by using FFMPEG to extract the frame back out as a JPEG looks perfect. p  pBut, to make the frame decode properly in JS, I have to do a conversion using FFMPEG. It does some magic, the file size drops to 58KB, and voila, everything starts working.p  pThe Openh264 libraries only work with the baseline configuration, so Im assuming I have some other random parameter set incorrectly. Problem is, if I use ffprobe to compare the frames  the settings are identical But the file sizes are different, so obviously emsomethingem is different.p  pSo now the final question  what tool can I use to truly see what FFMPEG is doing behind the scenes here to make my manually encoded frame work Is there a tool that will let me compare emallem the details of two h264 framesp

Negative 1000 pI am currently working on a project that will keep track of player scores and other information for a game called Farkle. I have done about 100 Google searches and read several entries on here as well. I have tried implementing and using everything I have found, but I am just at ends here. p  pThe strongrow.xmlstrong will be loaded as a single item in a codeListViewcode.p  pUltimately, I want to have in order you will see my row.xml layout below  Players name checkbox checkbox Players score.p  pI can get the app to run, so I dont have an issue at launch, however, as soon as I attempt to add a new player, the app breaks.p  pNow, the code I have below is a new project, as the last one had broken to a point that it showed no errors but would crash on launch. I have tried using a custom codeArrayAdaptercode, and I believe this is the method that will work for me, but I just cannot seem to get it to load the row.xml without crashing. I am still new to the ArrayAdapter, and I have done a few tutorials, but I still cant get it worked.p  pIf anyone has any ideas as to what I can do to get this worked, please help and get me pointed in the right direction. I have been working on this for 2 weeks now Thank you in advance.p  pstrongactivitymain.xmlstrongp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltLinearLayout

Negative 1000 pI have a class called codeRetreiveHttpStringResponsecode. Its used to get an codeInputStreamcode from an URL containing JSON data. The class extends codeAsyncTaskltString, Void, InputStreamgtcode. So the strange problem here is that null is always returned. No matter what. There is even no Exception.

Negative 1000 pIm using Spring 3 to design a website. On one part of the website, you can search ids. However, ids are not unique and may return multiple records. To create a unique key, we use a timestamp associated with that idp  pWhen a user does a lookup for an id and there are multiple results, the site displays a radio selection of timestamps to allow the user to choose their record. p  pWhat I want to do is display the information from the record on the page. However, due to the possibility of multiple records, this display needs to be able to change whenever the user selects a radio button. p  pIs this possible Can I change the text on the page without forcing a reload p  pThe other option Im considering is embedding the information in an iframe and having that reload within the search page.

Negative 1000 pI have the following problem with clearing entities in doctrinebr  I have two entities connected together, one of which is the mainentity so to say and one of which is the subentity that belongs to the mainentity. Then when I use the according repository to clear, it only clears the mainentity but leaves the subentity.br Flushing the entities is actually working fine, because the entities are connected via cascade, so when I flush the main entity, the subentity gets flushed also. But this cascading does not seem to work with the clear.br  Is there a way to also clear all the subentites together with the main entities without creating an extra and actually not needed for other things repository for the subentities Thank you in advance.br br  EDIT Ok since Ive seemingly been too unspecific, my goal is to strongclearstrong the entities in doctrine, strongnotstrong delete them in the database. The problem is, that I have a lot of entities to process and doctrine doesnt clear up all entity references in the memory. So is there a way to cascade that, or do I need the repositories for thatp  pLAST EDIT Problem has been fixed by doctrine. See accepted answerp

Negative 1000 pI am developing a Java web application and am using Apache Tomcat 7.0.53 to access with my localhost.  Using Windows 7 and Chrome Version 35.0.1916.86 betam.  We have several javascript files that are concatenated together and minified.  Weve allowed a maven option to not minify the code while the concatenating happens.  So in one example file I have jquery minified followed by some other custom js not minified.  Throughout my workday I will have several times where Chrome downloads these larger js files in 8192 byte chunks.  The problem is that there is sometimes a pause between each 8K chunk.  I just waited 12 minutes for a 2.3MB js file to be completely loaded.

Negative 1000 pSo I must say that all of the websocket tutorialsexamples appear to be so easy, but it seems you really have to dig to find really important pieces of information that are left out of the simple examples.  Im stil having quite a few issues with my webapp using the Spring 4 Stomp message broker with SockJS on the front end.p  pCurrently, if I add an endpoint to the StompEndpointRegistry without enabling SockJS, then declare my socket on the front end using dojos dojoxsocket, Firefox 28 will open a websocket just fine.  However, I need support in IE8 and IE9, so I switched to SockJS.  Using AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer, it took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to ensure all filters and servlets were set to use async very sparse documentation on the web for this.  Once I solved this, I can now get it to work in Firefox, but only using xhrstreaming.  With sessionCookieNeeded set to true, IE9 defaults to trying to use iframes for the connection, however, it failsp  precodeLOG Opening Web Socket...

I enabled the same origin x frame headers in spring security and Ive verified the headers are present in the requests, but it didnt help.  So Id like to be able to figure out how to A make Spring and SockJS properly negotiate using WebSocket transport in Firefox, and B get IE8 and 9 to properly use iframe transport so I can keep cookies.  p  pHeres my configcodep  pWeb app configp  precodepublic class WebAppInitializer extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer       Override     public void onStartupServletContext servletContext throws ServletException          super.onStartupservletContext         MapltString,  extends FilterRegistrationgt registrations  servletContext.getFilterRegistrations           Override     protected void customizeRegistrationServletRegistration.Dynamic registration           this is needed for async support for websocketssockjs         registration.setInitParameterdispatchOptionsRequest, true         registration.setAsyncSupportedtrue           Override     protected Classltgt[] getRootConfigClasses          return new Class[]SecurityConfig.class, Log4jConfig.class, PersistenceConfig.class, ServiceConfig.class           Override     protected Classltgt[] getServletConfigClasses           loading the Initializer class from the dispatcher servlet context ensures it only executes once,          as the ContextRefreshedEvent fires once from the root context and once from the dispatcher servlet context            return new Class[]SpringMvcConfig.class, WebSocketConfig.class           Override     protected String[] getServletMappings          return new String[]             rest,             index.html,             login.html,             admin.html,             index,             login,             admin                    Override     protected Filter[] getServletFilters          OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter openEntityManagerInViewFilter  new OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter         openEntityManagerInViewFilter.setBeanNameopenEntityManagerInViewFilter         openEntityManagerInViewFilter.setPersistenceUnitNameHSQL          CharacterEncodingFilter encodingFilter  new CharacterEncodingFilter         encodingFilter.setEncodingUTF8         encodingFilter.setForceEncodingtrue          return new javax.servlet.Filter[]openEntityManagerInViewFilter, encodingFilter        codepre  pSpring MVC configp  precodeConfiguration EnableWebMvc EnableGlobalMethodSecurityprePostEnabled  true, securedEnabled  true ComponentScanbasePackages  x.controllers   Only scan for controllers.

Negative 1000 pI followed this a hrefhttparnab.orgblogquickandeasymulticoresort relnofollowblog entrya to parallelize sort by splitting a large file, sorting and merging.

I assumed that codewaitcode without any arguments would be the right thing, since according to the codemancode page, if codewaitcode is called without arguments codeall currently active child  processes  are  waited  forcode.p  pHowever, when I try this in the shell i.e. executing steps 1 and 2, and then codewaitcode, codewaitcode returns immediately, although codetopcode shows the codesortcode processes are still running.p  pUltimately I want to increase the speed of a script with that, so its not a one time thing I could do manually on the shell.p  pI know codesortcode has a codeparallelcode option since version 8, however on the cluster I am running this, an older version is installed, and I am also curious about how to solve this issue.p

Negative 1000 pWhy does this code[A]ltsubgt0ltsubgtMcode yield output as if it were code[Altsubgt0ltsubgt] Mcode The html is being run on a site that uses Drupal 6.x.

Based on other posts I have read, here is what I have already tried It says I am not running with administrator rights but I went to Control Panel User Accounts and it says that I am an administrator and the only administrator I went into Program Filesx86 and there is no MySQL folder there. I tried going into services. MySQL is Stopped. I cant start it it says Windows cant find the file. I edited both the ini files for MySQL and php to change the port from 3306 to 3308.  I tried going into cmd to delete mysql and also to create a service entry. Both times I got an error message that said Open Service FAILED 5 Access is Denied. Id appreciate any help you can give to get this working.

Negative 1000 pIm yet to deploy an app to AWS or GAE thus such things arent very clear to me. In the case of GAE which Im considering, since theyre a PaaS, and since they are saying that a developers only concern will be at the application layer, does that mean that I have two and only two responsibilities  one, making sure that my application code meets secure standards and, two, the very least I must do databasewise is that I make sure the table relationships are solidp  pAre those two conclusions correctp

So, bugs happen currently one of the systems is not authenticating users after a massive internal restructuring process. p  pWhat I do know Its probably a Struts framework, theres a Glassfish server, a Java class that does the authentication and a MySQL database.

Negative 1000 pIm having an issue with the keyboard logger. Every system tested until today is working fine, except a strongWindows 7 Embedded Standard 32 bitstrong that apparently freaks out with the current build.p  pWhat I need to do is record keystrokes entered from the keyboard, until I get a certain number of them. When I do, I call a certain procedure.p  pI have a hook defined like thisp  precodeSetWindowsHookExWHKEYBOARDLL, keyboardProcedure, GetModuleHandleNULL, 0 codepre  pand a keyboardProcedure callback p  precodeLRESULT CALLBACK SystemKeyboardReadWritekeyboardProcedureint nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam     ...   codepre  pIm using Qt 5.2 for this application.p  pSo, in more depth, the problem occurs when you enter the keys too fast or hold a certain key  for a longer period of time, which will force the keyboard to send multiple keyboard events. When that happens, the hook will freeze and not send any more events to the callback. not the entire application, the app will still continue running with the exception of the keyloggerp  pThis problem occurs only on this OS, on no other Windows 7 OS, or Windows XP have I noticed the issue. I have 2 computers with the same setup and they both show the same problem, also Im developing the app on a Windows 7 professional and it also seems fine. Im wondering if this is an issue with my application, or is it something outside of my control.p  pThanks everyone for their help.p

Negative 1000 pI noticed something odd regarding ajax and image loading. Suppose you have an image on the page, and ajax requests the same image  one would guess that ajax requests would hit the browser cache, or it should at least only make one request, the resulting image going to the page and the script that wants to readprocess the image.p  pSurprisingly, I found that even when the javascript waits for the entire page to load, the image request still makes a new request Is this a known bug in Firefox and Chrome, or something bad jQuery ajax is doingp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net95mnf9rm1 relnofollowHere you can see the problema, open Fiddler or Wireshark and set it to record before you click runp  precodeltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.11.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltdiv idsomething stylebackgroundimageurlhttpjsfiddle.netimglogowhite.pnggtHelloltdivgt ltscriptgt  jQueryfunction      window.loadfunction          .gethttpjsfiddle.netimglogowhite.png        ltscriptgt codepre  pNote that in Firefox it makes two requests, both resulting in 200OK, and sending the entire image back to the browser twice. In Chromium, it at least correctly gets a 304 on second request instead of downloading the entire contents twice.p  pOddly enough, IE11 downloads the entire image twice, while it seems IE9 aggressively caches it and downloads it once.p  pIdeally I would hope the ajax wouldnt make a second request at all, since it is requesting exactly the same url. Is there a reason css and ajax in this case usually have different caches, as though the browser is using different cache storage for css vs ajax requestsp

Negative 1000 pAs the title says, Im trying to count the number of times a value reoccurs within the same array.

Heres what I have so farp  precodeforeach var i in anArray      foreach var m in secondArray              if i  m                      count                   Console.WriteLinenValue   i   occurred   count   times   codepre  pI created a copy of the first arraysecondArray and am trying to make due comparing the arrays, but something is not right. The nested loop counts my values twice. So, where it would say value 1 occurred 2 times, the next readout says value 1 occurred 4 times, instead of moving on to the next value thats not 1. I realize its counting the second 1 and adding the previous count to it...least I think I realize. How can I get around this only using arrays and no lists p

That way its always an update statement when I reference it in the code. p  pHere is my Table Structurep  precode        CREATE TABLE authentication            userid int11 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,           fname varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           lname varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           email varchar50 COLLATE utf8unicodeci NOT NULL DEFAULT ,           password varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           online int11 DEFAULT NULL,           createdat varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           PRIMARY KEY email,           KEY userid userid          ENGINEMyISAM AUTOINCREMENT5 DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COLLATEutf8unicodeci           CREATE TABLE userprogress            userid int10 NOT NULL,           progressevent varchar25 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           PRIMARY KEY userid          ENGINEMyISAM DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COLLATEutf8unicodeci codepre  pHere is an example trigger I tried to makep  precode        CREATE TRIGGER userprogressadd         AFTER INSERT ON authentication         FOR EACH ROW         BEGIN           INSERT INTO userprogress userid, progressstatus           VALUES NEW.userid, signup         END codepre  pThis trigger did not work.

Negative 1000 pI am new to link, this is my first task using it, and it is not going well.  I have a page that can be sorted by the column the gets clicked on.

Negative 1000 pWhenever I want to use mipmaps in opengl, i need to upload the highest resolution bitmap as mipmap level 0, and then upload lower resolutions bitmaps at higher mipmap levels.p  pI would have liked to be able to add higher resolution mipmaps as well as lower resolution mipmaps. Presently the only hardware way I know is to start a new mipmaped texture and reupload all previously uploaded bitmaps.p  pAny other hardware way to do thisp  peditbr  It appears GLTEXTUREBASELEVEL and GLTEXTUREMAXLEVEL do not change the fact that opengl will allocate memory for all texture mipmap levels at texture creation, therefore it cant be used in this case since its impossible to know which textures will need higher resolution mipmaps and which wont, so it would lead to extreme memory waste.p  pIt looks that the only way to do this in hardware would be to recreate a new texture with the newly generated higher resolution mipmap at mipmap level 0, and then copy all previous lower resolution mipmaps at lower mipmap levels.p  pAs far as I know, the only ways would be either to keep all previously generated mipmap levels in memory in case I need to reupload them would rather not waste this much memory, regenerate all mipmap levels wont do, way too slow, copy the previous textures mipmap levels to system memory using gltexsubimage2d and then uploading them to the new texture thats gotta be slow, or copying them straight from the previous texture to the new texture.p  pSo, is there a way to copy a textures selected mipmap to a different textures mipmap, something like glcopytexturetextureid1,texturemipmap1,textureid2,texturemipmap2p  pedit2br  It seems there is a somewhat recent extension extension 2009 became core in 2012 that does this exactly a hrefhttpswww.opengl.orgwikiTextureStorageTexturecopy relnofollowhttpswww.opengl.orgwikiTextureStorageTexturecopya but one of the requirements of this contract is support of computers up to 10 years old.p

Negative 1000 pI have a fairly simple web API application that currently has one route setup.

If I try to navigate to the root of my application I get a 403 back, once again as a webpage.  I would prefer this be a 404, but the bigger question is how do I make emallem responses from my application be JSON rather than only responses on valid routes  I mention the 403 because I am looking for a broader solution than just setting up a catchall route, since I dont believe that will help me with the 403 or any other random exception that occurs outside of a controller action.p  pPreferrably, I would like my application to respect the accept header on the request.

Negative 1000 pI have a large, mixed C and Fortran code base that Im trying to debug.p  pThe program is built with GCC and GNU Fortran version 4.8.

Negative 1000 pHy, i have a UICollectionViewController where scrolling in a vertical direction is possible. I have several sections, for instance, Movies, Books, Music, etc. And several items per section, Movie 1, Movie 2, Music 1, Music 2. I was able to split the different sections by creating Header. I used the example in a hrefhttpwww.appcoda.comsupplementaryviewuicollectionviewflowlayout relnofollowHow to Add Header and Footer View in UICollectionViewa, so my application is very similar to the one in that example.br Now what i wanted to do is, enabling horizontal scrolling in the several items per section, without scrolling the entire page. Or by other words, if i have one screen with the Section Movies and Music. If i scroll horizontal in the Movies section, i will see Movies 2, but Music 1. If i scroll again in Movies i will see Movies 2, but still Music 1. Ive read that UICollectionView only permits one type of scrolling, either vertical or horizontal, and that lead me to UITableView, but searching on that topic i only found solutions that when you swipe horizontally all the sections move, and not only one.br Thank you in advancep  pstrongEDITstrongbr Maybe i can use a UITableView and add a UIScrollView with the contentSize of the UITableView Cell, any ideas if that is a good way to gop

Negative 1000 pIm developing an Eclipse plugin that needs to figure out the amount of time that it took for Eclipse to start.p  pI can get the amount of time since JVM startup in my plugin by using codeorg.eclipse.ui.startupcode extension point and recording the time by using codeManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean.getUptimecode or codeeclipse.startTimecode system property.p  pHowever, during startup, Eclipse might ask the user for workspace location and this will be counted in the JVM startup time. As my plugin is trying to measure the nonuserinteraction time, this makes the above approach rather useless unless user has selected a default workspace location but there is no guarantee that this is the case.p  pIdeally, I would like to know the moment in time when user dismissed the choose workspace dialog or, if user was using default workspace then equivalent moment. Or some other moment as close to that as possible.p  pIve done a bit of research and there does not seem to be any official extension point for such a thing.p  pI have a feeling that something like that might be possible with a custom OSGi bundle running at early enough startlevel 2. However, Im not sure if it will actually workp  ul limaybe workspace selection dialog is shown from some Eclipse core plugin, started at startlevel 4 like the rest of the pluginsli lieven if I manage to write such a bundle, do I need to modify Eclipse codeconfig.inicode to list it there Or how do I guarantee that it will be started at certain startlevel if it is not a real Eclipse plugin but a custom bundle a hrefhttpeclipsesource.comblogs20090610osgiandstartlevels relnofollowThis articlea mentions codep2.infcode but my experiments with it have not been successful yet.li ul  pAs I do not have much experience with OSGi and Eclipse plugin development, maybe I have missed something rather obvious and the solution is much simpler than what I envisionedp  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong After a bit more research, I found an early extension point StartupMonitor service usually used to customize the splash screen or provide some other sort of startup progress monitor, see a hrefhttpwiki.eclipse.orgindex.phpEquinoxLauncherPlanEclipseStarter.2CStartupMonitor.2FAnimator.2CandSplashBundle relnofollowherea for more details. That could be a possible candidate for my needs, now I just need to figure out, how to make Eclipse aware of it I suspect I need to add it in codeconfig.inicode.p  pAnother option Im considering is to implement a JVM agent and instrument Eclipse a hrefhttpsgithub.comeclipseeclipse.platform.uiblobmasterbundlesorg.eclipse.ui.ide.applicationsrcorgeclipseuiinternalideapplicationIDEApplication.java relnofollowIDEApplicationa class, adding some code snippets that I need.

Negative 1000 pstrongContextstrongp  pWe have 6 instances of Cassandra hosted on AWS, separated into 3 different regions, 2 per regions 2 in euwest, 2 in uswest, 2 in apsoutheast.p  p2 days ago, we moved 2 of our EC2 Cassandra instances from uswest1 to useast1. When I say move I mean that we decommissioned them and added 2 new instances on our cluster.p  pWe ran codenodetool repaircode which didnt do anything, and codenodetool rebuildcode which synchronized our data from the euwest data centre. Following that change we noticed that multiple instances on our Cassandra cluster were using over 70 CPU and had incoming traffic.p  pAt first, we thought it was the replication taking place, but considering that we only had 500MB of data, and that it is still running we are puzzled as to what is happening.p  hr  pstrongInstances hardwarestrongp  pAll of our instances are running on m3.medium which means that we are onp  ul li1 CPU, 2.5 GHzli li3.75 GB of RAMli li4GB SSDli ul  pAlso we have mounted an EBS volume for codevarlibcassandracode which is actually a RAID0 of 6 SSDs on EBSp  ul liEBS volume 300GB SSD, RAID0li ul  pRef a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comec2instancetypes relnofollowAmazon Instances Typesap  hr  pstrongSoftware Versionstrongp  pCassandra Version 2.0.12p  hr  pstrongThoughtsstrongp  pAfter analysing our data we thought this was caused by Cassandra data compaction.p  pThere is another stackoverflow question around the same subject a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28236638cassandracompactiontasksstuckCassandra compaction tasks stucka.p  pHowever, this was solved by going for a single SSD Azure Premium Storage  still in preview and no RAID0 configured for Cassandra, and as the author said, there is no reason for this to fix the underlying problem why would removing the RAID0 part from the equation fix this.p  pWe are not keen yet to move to a local storage as AWS pricing is a lot higher than what we have now. Even though, if it really is the cause of our problem, we will try it.p  pAnother reason why this sounds like a deeper problem is that we have data showing that these EBS volumes have been writingreading a lot of data in the last 3 days.p  pSince we moved instances, we get something around 300400KB of written data per second on each EBS volume, so since we have a RAID0, 6 times this amount per second  1.82.4MBs. This amounts to 450GB of data written PER instance over the last 3 days. And we have basically the same value for READ operation too.p  pWe are only running tests on them at the moment, so the only traffic we are getting is coming from our CI server and eventually from the communication that Gossip is doing between the instances.p  hr  pstrongDebug notesstrongp  pOutput of codenodetool statuscodep  precodeDatacenter cassandraeuwest1A  StatusUpDown  StateNormalLeavingJoiningMoving   Address         Load       Tokens  Owns   Host ID                               Rack UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 539.5 MB   256     17.3  1234123412341234123412341234123412340cd7  euwest1c UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 539.8 MB   256     14.4  30ff8d001ab645389c67a49e9ad34672  euwest1b Datacenter cassandraapsoutheast1A  StatusUpDown  StateNormalLeavingJoiningMoving   Address         Load       Tokens  Owns   Host ID                               Rack UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 585.13 MB  256     16.9  a0c45f3f84794046b3c0b2dd19f07b87  apsoutheast1a UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 588.66 MB  256     17.8  b91c5863e1e14cb6b9c10f24a33b4baf  apsoutheast1b Datacenter cassandrauseast1A  StatusUpDown  StateNormalLeavingJoiningMoving   Address         Load       Tokens  Owns   Host ID                               Rack UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 545.56 MB  256     15.2  ab049390f5a149a9bb58b8402b0d99af  useast1d UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 545.53 MB  256     18.3  39c698ea27934aa0a28dc286969febc4  useast1e codepre  pOutput of codenodetool compactionstatscodep  precodepending tasks 64           compaction type        keyspace           table       completed           total      unit  progress                Compaction         staging    statshourly       418858165      1295820033     bytes    32.32 Active compaction remaining time    0h00m52s codepre  pRunning codedstatcode on unhealthy instancep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgtfcF.png altdstat on unhealthy instancep  pCompaction history in graph form average of 300 times per hour starting the 16thp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYdEOV.png altCompaction history graphp  pEBS Volumes usagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6wuH6.png altEBS Volume 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxTyJ1.png altEBS Volume 2p  pRunning df hp  precodeFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use Mounted on devxvda1       33G   11G   21G  34  none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0 sysfscgroup udev            1.9G   12K  1.9G   1 dev tmpfs           377M  424K  377M   1 run none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0 runlock none            1.9G  4.0K  1.9G   1 runshm none            100M     0  100M   0 runuser devxvdb       3.9G  8.1M  3.7G   1 mnt devmd0        300G  2.5G  298G   1 varlibcassandra codepre  pRunning codenodetool tpstatscodep  precodePool Name                    Active   Pending      Completed   Blocked  All time blocked MutationStage                     0         0        3191689         0                 0 ReadStage                         0         0         574633         0                 0 RequestResponseStage              0         0        2698972         0                 0 ReadRepairStage                   0         0           2721         0                 0 ReplicateOnWriteStage             0         0              0         0                 0 MiscStage                         0         0          62601         0                 0 HintedHandoff                     0         1            443         0                 0 FlushWriter                       0         0          88811         0                 0 MemoryMeter                       0         0           1472         0                 0 GossipStage                       0         0         979483         0                 0 CacheCleanupExecutor              0         0              0         0                 0 InternalResponseStage             0         0             25         0                 0 CompactionExecutor                1        39          99881         0                 0 ValidationExecutor                0         0          62599         0                 0 MigrationStage                    0         0             40         0                 0 commitlogarchiver                0         0              0         0                 0 AntiEntropyStage                  0         0         149095         0                 0 PendingRangeCalculator            0         0             23         0                 0 MemtablePostFlusher               0         0         173847         0                 0  Message type           Dropped READ                         0 RANGESLICE                  0 TRACE                       0 MUTATION                     0 COUNTERMUTATION             0 BINARY                       0 REQUESTRESPONSE             0 PAGEDRANGE                  0 READREPAIR                  0 codepre  pRunning iptraf, sorted by bytesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUsDN2.png altiptraf sorted by bytesp

Negative 1000 pIll try to be clear. Here is the context Im coding a library which will be used as a dynamic DLL in a different project.p  pI have 1 class which is internal and 2 interfacesp  precodeinternal class FinalClass  IFinalClass      public string Libelle  get set    public interface IFinalClass  IBase       some properties   public interface IBase      string Libelle  get set   codepre  pThen, I load my library in my project, and I want to manipulate the IFinalClass type only.p  pI create a combobox with many IFinalClass items, and set the displaymember to Libelle. The problem is I cant see the value of Libelle, indeed the assembly of FinalClass appears instead. like if we are doing a ToString.If Im right, the combobox cannot find the property Libelle. p  pBut its weird, because everything works fine if I cast the IFinalClass items to  IBase before filling the combobox datasource.p  pIm very curious of whats happening in this case.p  pNote that the class that implements Libelle is internal, so the other project doesnt know this type.p  pAny idea  Thank youp

Negative 1000 pI have a sender and receiver servers both on weblogic servers and I am attempting to send across a SOAP message to a message protected composite on the target server. Sender server is on jdk6cu91 and the target is on jdk6cu29. I have certificates from CA installed on the receiver servers IdentityStore.jks and it has server certificate, intermediate , and root certificates.p  pIssue communication happens successfully only when I have root and intermediate certificates installed in the sending servers TrustStore, if I only have the root certificate it gives error, unknowncertificate. I dont understand the need of intermediate certificate on the client. Could somebody give some guidance on this, please How can I get this working without intermediate certificate on the clientp  pOperations team procured the certificates from CA and forwarded them to me. I used      java utils.ImportPrivateKey keystore Identity.jks storepass  keyfile privatekey.pem keyfilepass  certfile server.crt keyfile privatekey.pem alias identitykey command to create the identitystore as I did not create the original csr. Then used      keytool importcert alias rootcacert file rootcert.crt keystore Identity.jks storepass  to add root certificate and then similarly intermediate certificatein fact tried switching the order of these two imports as wellp  pOnly soa serverwhere the target soa composite is is https enabled admin is not.p  pWhen using Djavax.net.debugall on the sender soa server it shows the certificate chain received and that only has the server certificate signed by intermediate cert and does not show the intermediate and root from the receiver server. The order of certificates in receiver identity store is root, server, intermediate which I am not able to change regardless of root or intermediate added first there is no server certificate import step as that is done along with the  java utils.ImportPrivateKey which also created the Identity store and imported the server certificate.p  pI do see the below error actively being printed out in the receiver soa server log files      javax.net.ssl.SSLException Received fatal alert certificateunknown     at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Alerts.getSSLExceptionAlerts.java190     at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.fatalSSLEngineImpl.java1467p  pI dont know which particular certificate out of these 3 is it complaining about and was thinking it can be ignored as adding intermediate make the communication work.p

Negative 1000 pWere having a curious issue with the timing of beans, repositories, and controllers in our spring boot application.p  pWe have a NodeRepository that is backed by a Map.  This Map object should be a Map that we create using an Bean annotation, but it seems as though Spring is creating its own Map and injecting it on our NodeRepository.  This is a problem because the keys in the Map are wrong due to Spring make assumptions of our key values.p  pHere is all the needed codep  pstrongorg.xxx.Applicationstrongp  precodeConfiguration ComponentScan EnableAutoConfiguration public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer      Override     protected SpringApplicationBuilder configureSpringApplicationBuilder application           return application.sourcesApplication.class           Bean     public MapltString, RemoteNodegt getRemoteNodeMap           HashMapltString, RemoteNodegt remoteNodeMap  new HashMapltgt         remoteNodeMap.putNODE1, this.getRemoteNode1         remoteNodeMap.putNODE2, this.getRemoteNode2          return remoteNodeMap           Beanname  remoteNode1     public RemoteNode getRemoteNode1           return new DefaultRemoteNodeNODE1           Beanname  remoteNode2     public RemoteNode getRemoteNode2           return new DefaultRemoteNodeNODE2       codepre  pstrongorg.xxx.repository.RemoteNodeRepositorystrongp  precodeRepository public class RemoteNodeRepositoryImpl implements RemoteNodeRepository       private MapltString, RemoteNodegt remoteNodeMap      Autowired     public RemoteNodeRepositoryMapltString, RemoteNodegt remoteNodeMap          this.remoteNodeMap  remoteNodeMap       codepre  pWhat I expect to be injected into the RemoteNodeRepsoitory is a Map that looks like the followingp  blockquote   pNODE1,RemoteNodeNODE1p      pNODE2,RemoteNodeNODE2p blockquote  pHOWEVER, this is the Map that is being injected into the RemoteNodeRepositoryp  blockquote   premoteNode1,RemoteNodeNODE1p      premoteNode2,RemoteNodeNODE2p blockquote  pNOTE, the names of the keys are based on the name of the Bean annotations in the Application class.

Negative 1000 pHere is the scenario. I have a class, called strongBaseClassstrong and 6 class which extend this class strongDerivedClass1strong to strongDerivedCLass6strong. BaseClass has, lets say, 500 variables and not all of them are needed for all of the DerivedClass[1..6]. Yes, this is really bad and thats what I am trying to fix. The problem is that since polymorphism is used, after creating an instance of DerivedClass[1..6], it is assigned to a BaseClass reference. And every method call happens on this reference. So doing a Find all references is not very effective. Also, the code base is huge.p  pI need to figure out what common variables are used by these 6 derived classes and retain them in the BaseClass and move the remaining specific variables to their respective classes the way it was supposed to be done to begin with. p  pTrying to manually trace each variable and figure out the control flow and logic is quite cumbersome. I was hoping someone had some better ideas.p  p UPDATE p  pIll explain with an example.p  precodepublic class BaseClass      private String common1     ...     private String common6      private String var1     ...     private String var60      getters and setters follow   public class DerivedClass1 extends BaseClass      private String 1a     private String 1b     ...     getters and setters  codepre  p...p  precodepublic class DerivedClass6 extends BaseClass      private String 6a     private String 6b     ...     getters and setters  codepre  pThe BaseCLass variables common1 to common6 are used by all derived classes.p  pDerivedClass1 uses var1 to var10p  pDerivedClass2 uses var11 to var20p  p...p  pDerivedClass6 uses var51 to var60p  pWhat I want to do is figure out common1 to common6 and retain them in BaseClass. And move the specific derived class variables to their respective classes. And these are POJOs, so there are no other methods apart from getters and setters.p  pThe way these are used is the specific derived class object is created and assigned to base class reference. And methods are invoked on the base class reference. And the base class reference is used everywhere. In some situations, the object is retrieved from a hashmap based on an id and assigned to the base class reference. Even if I try to follow the code, I wont know what type of object is being used in that scenario. p  pI hope this makes sense.p

Negative 1000 pI have a NT service which is executing a .exe and is developed in VB 6.0. My exe is pointing to a SQL server data source. Recently I had to modify the SQL server name in the alias to which my exe is pointing to. I changed it via ODBC DATA SOURCE ADMINISTRATOR. But I noticed that the NT service has stopped working post sql server name change. I confirm that the application to SQL server connectivity is working fine. So why my NT service is not working as expectedp  pI faced the similar situation in a different web server. Post sql server name change, I had to re deploy the application and reinstall the exe in order to make things work. My question is Why do I need to redeploy it Any other option can I try in this case to make things workp
Negative 1000 pI have setup a worksheet that has a data input page that feeds a number of graphs pages,  these are normal worksheet pages with graphs on them rather than actual chart pages.  Each graph pages has anywhere from 1 to 10 graphs on it, giving me a total of around 130 graphs.  Needless to say, I had find an easy way to print these graphs as they will not all be printed at the same time.  I decided to utilize a series of check boxes that would allow the user select the graphs they would like to print and then hit a print button that has a macro assigned to it.  I have ended up with the following code and for most of the pages it works perfectly.

Negative 1000 pI am wanting to create a service where a user streams a file to my server filesize approx. 160kbsec, this file is then modified lets say 0 latency for this purpose and sent back to the user as a stream.p  pThe file will be streamed through TCP or similar as it must not contain errors.p  pSo to reiterate. The user streams a file to my server, my server modifies it live and sends it back as a stream.p  pHow do I calculate the latency between the user sending the file and the user getting the file backp  pIf the filesize per second is well within the users upload speed will it match the ping Or will the TCP protocall and data buffering etc add on a lot of extra time p  pIf it requires a lot of extra time seconds I guess I may consider UDP also or perhaps a choice for the user i.e. speed vs qualityp  pAs a side question, for TCP streaming how does one consider buffering times i.e. If I want to make sure there are not any drop outs.p  pHope this is clear  thanks in advancep

Negative 1000 pWe are working on this issue wherein we are opening a dialog pdialog without clicking on YESNO button of that dialog in a jsf page, we tampered the session id with some new values using tampered data plugin tool of firefox. in this case my session should get expire and page should redirect as session expire. but in actual the session is not expired and dialog box remains open. Please help us out in getting the solution. also we found that whenever we do not open dialog box and we just navigate to different tabs in a page and tampered the session id then the session gets expired which is expected. This does not work when we open a dialog in page. We want to expire session whenever we tampered session ID.p

Negative 1000 pIm creating a Delphi package using OpenGL and the GLEW extension. I downloaded GLEW from the official website. That was a painful way to make it usable with Embarcadero, but I finally succeeded. At this point, Im able to compile and use GLEW in any C Builder or Delphi application project.p  pHowever, I experiment difficulties to use GLEW in my Delphi package. As GLEW is a DLL, I declare the external functions that I need as in the following examplep  precodeprocedure glBindVertexArrayglArray GLuint external glew32.dll name glewBindVertexArray codepre  pThis works well when I compile an application project, so Im sure that the declaration is correct. I can compile and link my package without problems. However, when I try to use it in a demo project, I receive the following link errorp  precode[ilink32 Error] Error Unresolved external glewBindVertexArray referenced from CUSERSPUBLICDOCUMENTSEMBARCADEROSTUDIO15.0DCPQRMODELS.LIBTQRMD2OpenGL codepre  pSo my GLEW functions are not found by the linker. The problem is that I dont know how to link an external DLL into a Delphi package. When I try to add the DLL in the Requires section, my package can no more be compiled and I receive the following errorp  precode[dcc32 Fatal Error] QRModels.dpk35 E2202 Required package glew32 not found codepre  pI also tried to add glew32.lib in my package, and tried to link GLEW in my target project, but without success.p  pSo, what is the correct way to link an external standard DLL, that isnt a .dcp, in Embarcadero Delphi packages I remember you that I can use this DLL without problems in any Delphi application project, and I own the corresponding .lib too, that is already converted to be used with Embarcadero compiler.p  pRegardsp  pstrongNOTEstrong As suggested in the comment posted by David Heffernan, I tried to create a small package that includes an external function to the user32.dll. This worked well. I also tried to include one of my GLEW external function. Now the issue is different the package links and builds well, and the target project too. But when the exe runs, I get an error message saying that glew32.dll is missing on my computer. So my issue is basically a bad installation of the GLEW library. However, all my other projects using GLEW works well, including those I create with other compilers, as e.g. CodeBlocks.p  pI also compared my package options, and the only thing that is different is that the package I create is divided in 2 projects, one for the design time and one for the runtime. I already created such other packages without problems, but I never tried to include external DLL in them.p  pHere is my test unitp  precodeunit Unit1  interface  uses OpenGL  function MessageBeepuType Cardinal LongBool stdcall external user32 procedure glBindVertexArrayglArray GLuint stdcall external glew32.dll name glewBindVertexArray  type     TTest  classTObject         public             procedure TestBeep virtual             procedure TestGlew virtual     end  implementation procedure TTest.TestBeep begin     MessageBeep40 end  procedure TTest.TestGlew begin     glBindVertexArray0 end  end. codepre  pRegardsp

Negative 1000 pI have a small doubt in implementing ETL at my workplace. I have only one year of experience in this.  My question is, when we direct load the data from source systems to staging are, we are creating a scheme just as source architecture. 1. after performing transformation on this source scheme in staging area, can we put end target tables in target database as target 2. or else shall we create another target schema in staging database having structure of target database and load into it first after transformation. Later, a direct load from target schema in staging database to target database Which will be better And does the first process impact the performance of target databasep

Negative 1000 pI am using Titanium SDK 4.1.0.GA and originally used version 1.2 of the Ti.Paint module for iOS. This version does not work properly on iOS 8 in the sense that the line drawn stutters.p  pI then upgraded the Ti.Paint module to 1.4 currently the latest release. The line drawing on the canvas now works perfectly, but for some reason there are no event Listeners for the Ti.Paint Object, where there were in previous versions of the module.p  pHow does one now check if someone is actually drawing on the canvas A good example of this is if you want use to Ti.Paint to have users provide their signature and you want to validate that interaction on the Canvas occurred.p

Negative 1000 pIf I am given an array X of n distinct integers which is interpreted as a complete binary tree so if the parent is at index i , then its left child would be at index 2i and its right child would be at index 2i1 , so Now if root is considered to be at level 0 , then how can we find the level of an element X[i] p  pI followed the approach of first considering the fact that at a level k , I would be having 2k nodes, so I just considered that in the array starting from certain index a upto b , I have all the numbers at the same level k , so in a particular portion I have 2k nodes inclusive of a and b , so before a , total no of nodes , are  202122.....2k1 ,since index a is at level k , so before it there would be k1 levels ,so I summed them all up , Now I am stucked up while calculating the value of b , so please guide about how to calculate the value of b p

Negative 1000 pI am new to JMeter and we are using it to develop a test plan for our NodeExpress server. I added two HTTP requests one to add a user, and one to delete that user. The first request add user goes through fine, but the second request is failing. The reason it is failing appears to be that JMeter is setting two ContentLength headers onto the request  one is correct and the other is not. The server logs show this errorp  precode [Error request size did not match content length] type request.size.invalid, message request size did not match content length, statusCode 400, status 400, received 2, expected 1299, length 1299  codepre  pIn the View Results Tree, I see that the second request has the following headersp  precodeRequest Headers Connection keepalive ContentType applicationjson ContentType applicationjson charsetutf8 Date Wed, 30 Sep 2015 185017 GMT Vary AcceptEncoding XPoweredBy Express ContentLength 1299 Connection ContentLength 2 UserAgent ApacheHttpClient4.2.6 java 1.5 codepre  pAs you can see, JMeter is setting two codeContentLengthcode headers and I cannot figure out why it should be code2code  not sure where the code1299code is coming from. Also I just noticed its setting two codeContentTypecode headers as well, not sure if that is related.p  pI have googled this issue and cannot seem to find any answers. If anyone has any tips or suggestions, it would be appreciated. I am attaching screenshots of JMeter for reference sensitive information removed.
