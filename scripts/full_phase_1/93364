Positive 93364 pI am currently updating a VB.NET application with Visual Studio 2013 that possibly was originally created on VS2010 or VS2012.p  pThis application uses a Network SQL Database p  pEverything goes fine up to the point of installing when just shows an error message. that says the Assembly Microsoft.VisualBasic.Shell.9.0 version 2.0.0.0 is required and then will not let me finish the installation.p  pThe project has been exported using the Visual Basic tool [OneClick]p  pI have already checked the References list on the Project menu, and is not included there. Also not available to be added.p  pThe project requires the Microsoft Framework 4.5, so it seems that the Shell v2.0.0.0 is pretty old...p  pDo you have any suggestions, this kept me scratching my head already quite a while...p

Positive 93364 pI have both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 installed on the same machine but I work mostly on 2013 right now. Usually I have many 36 instances of VS opened in the same time.p  pMany times during a day a random instance of VS just freezes. I can bring its window but I cannot do anything inside it. Whats interesting is that some parts of VS are still alive i.e. Diagnostic Tools was still working. It often happens after a while of inactivity but sometimes even during the debugging or after closing some modal window. It happens both in 2013 and in 2015.p  pCan you suggest how to debug this I cannot see anything in the event log, I tried to do codedevenv.exe ResetSettingscode but it didnt help. I have many extensions installed including ReSharper so I would prefer to avoid disabling them one by one as this would take some timep  pI am using VS 2013 Premium Update 5 and VS 2015 Enterprise.p

Positive 93364 pHi I need to move my source code from one my existing TFS server to a new TFS server that is a clone of my existing one. From what I remember I think both servers are 2012 and I am using Visual Studio 2013 for development.p  pThe clone already has my project on it, but it is an old version of the code. The existing server has the latest code but will be decommissioned soon.p  pWithout having admin access on either server how can I move my code from the existing server with the latest code to the new server with an old version of the code.p  pIs it possible to do this and maintain the project history including the last month of development, or will I only be able to keep the code  TFS is a managed service for me and I dont have the option to stay on the existing server.p  pI have only seen solutions where the new TFS server is clean. p

Positive 93364 pIm using Visual Studio 2013. I have a Custom Build Tool I think thats the right terminology at least created which processes Simulink .slx files. The gist of how it works is that VS will compile a Simulink model by launching MATLABSimulink and telling it to build the Simulink model into a DLL and generate some headers for use in other VS projects in the Solution. That functionality works just fine from the MATLABSimulink side. p  pThis Custom Build Tool, called Real Time Workshop  SLX, consists of a .props file, a .targets file, and a .xml file. To use it, I have a VS project with its Configuration Type set to Utility Properties, General page and my Custom Build Tool checked in the projects Build DependenciesBuild Customization... dialog. Then I drag various .slx files onto the project in the Solution Explorer and it adds them. Then I can build the project and it will process each .slx file as described above. p  pEach .slx file is dependent on a number of MATLAB scripts and other files. Changes in one of those other files needs to trigger a rebuild of the .slx file by Simulink. Currently, whenever the .slx file itself is unchanged, VS just skips over it. I cant seem to set additional dependencies for the .slx files.p  pIf I go to the Properties dialog for an individual .slx file, the Item Type specifies my Real Time Workshop  SLX as expected. However, when I go to the General page underneath Real Time Workshop  SLX things are grayed out and there is no Additional Dependencies entry.p  pI thought the purpose of Custom Build Tools was specifically to enable special processing like this. How do I specify file dependencies for the individual .slx files to be processed by my Real Time Workshop  SLX Custom Build Toolp  pOne other thing to note is that it appears that additional dependencies can be added to the .props file within the codeltAdditionalDependenciesgtcode tag, but then that creates a dependency relationship for emallem .slx files, which is not a viable solution.p

If I try to call emdevenv.comem, however, it starts building, but still no MSI is being produced.p  pWhen things start to build using emdevenv.comem It seems like it is completely disregarding the setup project I have checked the build configurations, and the setup project is checked for build on the ReleaseAny CPU configuration.p  pI have looked at build logs, build process activity logs, and I have also tried to perform the steps manually on the build agent, but I havent been able to find anything that could point me in the direction as to what might be causing the issue.p  pDoes anyone have an idea what could be the reason for this Could it be an issue with TFS Build 2015 The only difference between the old setup, and the new  as far as I can tell  is the followingp  ol liVS 2013 was installed on C rather than D on the new build agent, i.e. the path to emdevenvem would be different, but that should not matter as long as the build script is looking in the right place, and finds it...li liWe use a different drop location than what we used for the old setupli ol  pAppreciate any help and suggestions I can get.p

Negative 93364 pIn our old system we had pages rendered from XSLT.  In order to change the page into edit mode we would have a button of some sort, once clicked would have an EditYN flag which would be passed to the stored procedure.

My loader at the moment is quite simple and is designed to load only staticallylinked ELF files containing positionindependent code.p  pNormally, when a program is loaded by the kernels ELF loader, it is loaded into its own address space.  As such, the data segment and code segment can be loaded at the correct virtual address as specified in the ELF segments.p  pIn my case, however, I am requesting addresses from the kernel via codemmapcode, and may or may not get the addresses requested in the ELF segments.  This is not a problem for the code segment since it is position independent.

Negative 93364 pI am currently writing a Delphi application that runs queries over a DB2 database using ADO. p  pOne of the requirements is that the user should be able to define queries using dates, for example show me all data from the last 60 days or show me all data between November 20th 2009 and January 18th 2010. This wouldnt be an issue, except for two factsp  ol liDates are stored in the database using different fields for day, month and year.li liThe databases have been in use at several customer sites for a number of years and cannot be changed, and the application therefore has to run over the existing databases so no changing the database to store dates in one field, which would make the task much simpler. li ol  pWhat I need to know is whether there is an efficient algorithm for constructing the SQL required to extract the specified information from the database. For example, today is January 18th, so to extract all information from November 20th to today, I would need an SQL statement that goes something like thisp  precodeSELECT data WHERE  day gt 20 AND month  11 AND year  2009 OR  month  12 AND year  2009 OR  day lt 18 AND month  1 AND year  2010 codepre  pObviously this is a trivial and relatively straightforward example, but if the user wanted to retrieve data from November 2008 instead of 2009, the query would get a lot bigger.p  pIs this the only way that I can construct the SQL statement, or is there a more efficient way to do thisp

Negative 93364 pThe summer is coming up and I will be having a lot of time on my hands. I thought spending the time collaborating on a project online with several other passionated programmers somewhere in the world would be a great idea. Ive never tried online collaboration before although I am used to working in larger teams and using source control, so it would mainly be the lack of direct communication that would be new to me. I would be interested in starting a project with programmers around my own level or preferably better and finishing the project over the summerfall.p  pOne problem, however. Where would I go about finding people for such a project Im not interested in joining an ongoing project but rather be part of a new one. Certainly there must exist sites online where this is possible The project properly wouldnt huge in any way. Im thinking a little cozy project such as a arcade 2d game, a subtitle site, a world cup stats tracker or similiar.p  pAlso, what would be a better approach. Finding the people for the project and then come up with an idea for the project or putting an idea out there and see if anyone was interestedp  pPS If anyone on this site find the idea interesting feel free to post here or PM me and well have a talk about it. p

Negative 93364 pThis sentence provides semantic information on several objects p  pBob has two sons, Bill and Jim, who married Mary and Katy  respectively. Bill and Mary have twin girls, Jill and Amanda. p  pIn a normal semantic wiki eg, semediawiki, you can only give  semantic information for the page youre on. p  pIs there a semantic mediawiki that lets you provide information on  multiple items at once p  pSample syntax might be p  precodeBob has two sons, [BobsonBill] and [BobsonJim], who married  [BillwifeMary] and [JimwifeKaty] respectively. Bill and Mary have  twin girls, [BilldaughterJill] [MarydaughterJill] and  [BilldaughterAmanda] [MarydaughterAmanda].

Example p  precode[Bobtext has two sons, [BobsonBill] and [BobsonJim], who married  [BillwifeMary] and [JimwifeKaty] respectively. Bill and Mary have  twin girls, [BilldaughterJill] [MarydaughterJill] and  [BilldaughterAmanda] [MarydaughterAmanda].

For now, Im looking to do it technically and worry about the  other stuff later. p

Negative 93364 pI want to save the HTML tags of whole page that is going to render client side in the database table with a unique id so next time I can fetch that page directly from database with id and without any complicate logic execution. All this without any URL means I dont want to pass a URL to any method that will get the HTML tag. I want to get HTML tags  before even rendering the page because I have some status system once status changed that URL will not work.p  pSorry if my question is not clear, but I tried to mention all details. I simply want HTML tag of my view before sending it to client so that I can save those tags with a unique id in database table and next time I can just fetch those tags from the database table with that unique id. My need is that the view contains many complex queries that I dont want to run each time.p  pIts a kind of certificate in that once it is printed, it cannot be changed, it can only be viewed by that unique ID in a faster way. p

Negative 93364 pI thought CTEs were perfect for my stored procedure, until I found out they can only be referenced in ONE query ie the query immediately following the CTE.

Negative 93364 pAs, the header says, Im working on an Android application with a Layout View and two rows of buttons for accomplishing various tasks.

And thats for just one screen size, much less a 2nd one which is what Ive got now...p  pNow, this isnt ever going to be a publiclyavailable application, so Im not terribly worried about universal compatibility, but does anybody have suggestions for a simple layout XML description of one row of 5 buttons across both the top and bottom of the screen which is fixed in landscape modep  pAdditionally, does anybody know if its possible to locate layout widgets at run time  Its very easy to emresizeem them, but not to change their locations, as far as I can tellp  pThanks,br R.p

Negative 93364 pIve got a form that contains contact info. Each has a type, and then the contact information itself. For examplep  precodeType     Contact  cell     5555555555 home     4444444444 email    abcdef.com codepre  pIts a functional requirement that users can addremove contacts from the form using jQuery showing only the contact info that exists  i.e. its not a static contact form.p  pSince users can addremove any row they like in the form, this produces HTTP parameters similar to the following with numbers that are not sequential, and may not be contiguousp  precodecontactty3cell contact35555555555  contactty994home contact9944444444444  contactty45email contact45abcdef.com codepre  pTherefore, numbers after the codecontactcode and codecontacttycode parameters are arbitrary, except that they serve the purpose to match up the type to the associated contact information.p  pSo, on the receiving end, in PHP, how to I efficiently process the parameters, using the numbers to match up the types and contacts Im thinking the best way to do this would be via regex, but the simplest function I can think of iterates through the entire REQUEST array, strips out the parameters that start with codecontactcode, and go from there.p  pIs there a more efficient way Seems like Im writing a manual stringparam parsing method, when perhaps theres a function to do this that I simply dont know about. Since I wont know the precise names of the form parameters beforehand, I cant rely on the assumption that there will be a codecontact1code, codecontact2code, etc.p

Negative 93364 pIm working on an app that uses a web service. This is a private service so I cannot post the WSDL or generated code here so this is more of a question for some general advice rather than specifics.p  pI fed the WSDL into Sudzc. The WSDL originally had some imports of XSDs that sudzc would overlook so I copied these into the types section of the WSDL. p  pI use the generated code to make a request to the service but Im finding that the request is missing a name space for the complex type objects I copied into the types section of the WSDL.p  pAgain I know this is very general information but if anyone else has had a similar issue with Sudz it would be great to get your advice.p

Negative 93364 pIm trying to develop a feature for my app that pulls a string of text off of the internet sort of like twitter, but a lot more basic and displays it on the screen in a permeanent window. The user sees a large box with a refresh button next to it, and a small space below both where I would like to have a little progress monitor just a TextView which displays Refreshing... as soon as the refresh button is clicked, and then Refresh successful once the string of text has been successfully pulled from the internet and displayed. This is just to reassure the user that something is actually happening when they press the button.p  pAfter a emlotem of research Ive come to the conclusion that the way to update the TextView is to use a handler to execute a runnable which will update the text in the TextView. So my code looks like thisp  precode    refreshbutton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener              public void onClickView abc                          display Refreshing...                 refreshhandler.postrefreshingmsg              Code to pull the string of text from the internet goes here not shown                  display Refresh successul                 successfulhandler.postsuccessfulmsg                  clear the Refresh successful message after 2 seconds                 clearhandler.postDelayedclearmsg, 2000                   codepre  pI hope that sort of makes sense. My issue is that these things all happen at once I want the Refreshing... message to display, THEN for the phone to connect to the internet to find the string of text for the update, and THEN for the Refresh Successful message to display once the internet string has been successfully displayed. But what actually happens is that none of the commands in the onClick method actually happen until the phone has already pulled the message from the internet so the Refreshing... message isnt displayed at all. So what actually happens when the user clicks the button is that nothing happens for a second or two presumably because the phone is busy pulling the string from the internet, then the string from the internet is suddenly displayed along with the message saying Refresh Successful.p  pSo why is this happening Is onClick supposed to work this way If so, is there a workaround I havent posted my runnable and handler statements because Im not sure itll make any difference... but if it would help then I can post themp  pAlso, you can probably tell from this that I havent been doing android or indeed java for very long, but Im trying my best so please be gentle Thanks p

Negative 93364 pSo I would like to be able to call the unix mail function form a PHP script.  Yes, I know PHP has a built in mail function itself, but I am having issues with the PHP config on my intranet server and have been trying very hard to resolve with no such luck.  I figured it would be easier to just invoke the Unix mail function since I know it works with other scripts from PHP instead of trying to reconfigure the PHP install, which could end up messing things up for other sites.  Could someone explain how to accomplish this as well as how I can set up an email template to be sent out in the email  Thanks in advance p  pBrettp

App is ready to go and all works fine under normal circumstances, but if the user is being eratic and pushing buttons whilst rotating the iPad, then things go slightly awry and views load in the wrong place.p  pSo basically, I want to disable all my buttons before the iPad is rotated and enable them again after the view is done rotating.p  pI thought this would be easy using thep  precodevoiddidRotateFromInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationfromInterfaceOrientation codepre  pandp  precodevoidwillRotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalduration codepre  pmethods.p  pBut because the UIImagePickerController is being displayed, this for some reason stops these methods from being called. So I cant use these methods.p  pSo basically, what Im asking is if anybody can think of any other ways that I could achieve thisp  pThanks,p  pMattp

Negative 93364 pMy a hrefhttpsgithub.comcmullaparthiibrowse relnofollowIbrowse HTTP Clienta is behind a Network and any HTTP request to the outside has to go through a Proxy. Now, Ibrowse has a good example for this. However, i got a little confused. The Proxy behind which i am running the application uses codeDomain Authenticationcode this Domain is an codeActive Directorycode kinda setup whereby usually in a browser we would have to enter settings like this say the domain is codekyaugcode,pre username kyaug[YOURDOMAINUSERNAME] password [Domain Password] pre This means that code[YOURDOMAINUSERNAME]code is your Domain Username actually.brbr Now in the Ibrowse, an example that looks like this comes along pre ibrowsesendreqhttpwww.erlang.se, [], get, [],          [proxyuser, XXXXX,           proxypassword, XXXXX,           proxyhost, proxy,           proxyport, 8080], 5000. pre Now, lets say that my situation is as followsp  pre Domain                kyaug Domain Username       muzaayj Proxy Server          ppi.kyu.co.ug Proxy Port            3128 Domain Password       xxxxx             pre  pNow, When i try thsi below pre Options  [             proxyuser, kyaugmuzaayj,             proxypassword, My Domain Password,             proxyhost, ppi.kyu.co.ug,             proxyport, 3128         ],bribrowsesendreqhttpwww.google.com,[],post,Data,Options,infinity. prep  pThe proxy spits back to me an HTML page informing me that codePROXYAUTHREQUIREDcode and many other things about its administrators.

In the above, i am supplying this parameter the way the browsers take it as well, probably behind the scenes, its changed into a different arrangement. Some one assist in how i can correct this. How do browsers send their data to a proxy server for authentication given that the username must be append to the Domain to be used for authentication at the Proxy end  p

Negative 93364 pThe x8664 instruction set adds more registers and other improvements to help streamline executable code. However, in many applications the increased pointer size is a burden. The extra, unused bytes in every pointer clog up the cache and might even overflow RAM. GCC, for example, builds with the codem32code flag, and I assume this is the reason.p  pIts possible to load a 32bit value and treat it as a pointer. This doesnt necessitate extra instructions, just loadcompute the 32 bits and load from the resulting address. The trick wont be portable, though, as platforms have different memory maps. On Mac OS X, the entire low 4 GiB of address space is reserved. Still, for one program I wrote, hackishly adding code0x100000000Lcode to 32bit addresses before use improved performance greatly over true 64bit addresses, or compiling with codem32code.p  pIs there any fundamental impediment to having a 32bit, x8664 platform I suppose that supporting such a chimera would add complexity to any operating system, and anyone wanting that last 20 should just Make it Work, but it still seems that this would be the best fit for a variety of computationally intensive programs.p
Negative 93364 pI am trying to find out how to detect if a JComboBox lost focus when user pressed tab or via a mouseclick outside the components area.p  pAdding a FocusListener to the editor component of the JComboBox does not help me, as I cant find out if user used the mouse or moved the focus via the tab key.

In this case I want to change JComboBox to show the previously edited item, not what user navigated...li liThere are several other cases mouse item pick, the enter key, escape, etc.. I could easily handle these, but detecting tab is tricky because I cant catch this event as it is handled by FocusManager.li ul  pEdit 2 It seems that I have to use codesetFocusTraversalKeysEnabledfalsecode to get notified when TAB is pressed, and when i capture that event, I should manually transfer focus...

Negative 93364 pIm making a scheduling application which looks similar to Google Calendar, iCalendar, Outlooks calendar, and similar... As you may have seen in such apps, scheduled events are represented in rectangles, which can be very small especially if youre viewing a whole week.p  pMy challenge is to give the user a meaningful summary of the event before they click it, using text in the rectangle.  The text should be very compact.  To that end, I want it to wrap lines in a way that isnt very common, but I suspect .NET is capable of handling it natively.p  pIf a single word is wider than the rectangle, only the beginning of that word should show.  But wrapping should still occur upon encountering spaces, if the word which follows would fall partly outside the rectangle.  Not every space will cause wrapping to the next line, because if two or more words happen to fit on a line thats fine.p  pI suspect that the answer lies in the capabilities of StringFormat, StringTrimming, and FormatFlags, but I havent found the right combination to accomplish the goals.p  pFor example if we have...p  precodeChuck Norris Dentist Appointment codepre  pDue to limited space it might become...p  precodeChuc Norr Denti Appo codepre  pI do NOT want it to becomep  precodeChuc k Norr is Dent ist Appo intme nt codepre  pAs you see in this example, if the user already knows who Chuck Norris is, the presence of letter k and the letters is dont help the user recognize the name.  In fact, the presence of those letters may force Dentist Appointment to be hidden from view because vertical space is also limited.p  pI already know how to draw text in a rectangle that wraps in the normal way, and I also know how to get it to avoid drawing any text that falls outside the rectangle.  What I DONT know is how to get it to wrap upon encountering a space or carriage return while preventing it from wrapping midword if a single word is wider than the rectangle.  Any help therep

Unless loading potentially thousands of records into the collection is okp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe quickest possibly dirtiest method was to use the built in Backbone.Events system. Sample codep  precodevar aggregator   .extendaggregator, Backbone.Events  aggregator.onfileUpdated, functionmodel     ifapp.libraryCollection ampamp app.galleryCollection         libraryModel  app.libraryCollection.getmodel.getid         galleryModel  app.galleryCollection.getmodel.getid         libraryModel.setmodel.attributes         galleryModel.setmodel.attributes          codepre  pThen the Editor viewp  precodewindow.EditorView  Backbone.View.extend      saveModel function         self  this         form  this.el.findform.serializeArray         .eachform, functionfield             self.model.setfield[name], field[value]                  self.model.save         aggregator.triggerfileUpdated, this.model       codepre  pThis syncs the models across both collections, and because I bound the model change event with the render function not shown the view reflects the changes across both the library and gallery views.p

No build errors are going off, but when I return the serialized object it keeps returning null. Upon inserting some breakpoints and stepping through, I realized where everything was going south.p  pI put my break point in herep  precodevar tasks  ListltCSHTaskgtpersistanceManager.RetrieveAllltCSHTaskgtSessionAction.BeginAndEnd codepre  pAnd it goes into my PersistanceManager class, successfully passing my CSHTaskp  precodepublic IListltTgt RetrieveAllltTgtSessionAction sessionAction               Note that NHibernate guarantees that two object references will point to the           same object only if the references are set in the same session. For example,           Order 123 under the Customer object Able Inc and Order 123 in the Orders           list will point to the same object only if we load Customers and Orders in            the same session. If we load them in different sessions, then changes that           we make to Able Incs Order 123 will not be reflected in Order 123 in the           Orders list, since the references point to different objects. Thats why we           maintain a session as a member variable, instead of as a local variable.            Open a new session if specified         if sessionAction  SessionAction.Begin  sessionAction  SessionAction.BeginAndEnd                      mSession  mSessionFactory.OpenSession                    Retrieve all objects of the type passed in         ICriteria targetObjects  mSession.CreateCriteriatypeofT         IListltTgt itemList  targetObjects.ListltTgt           Close the session if specified         if sessionAction  SessionAction.End  sessionAction  SessionAction.BeginAndEnd                      mSession.Close             mSession.Dispose                    Set return value         return itemList      codepre  pWhich is straight from an older a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles21122NHibernateMadeSimple relnofollowexample of NHibernateaIm extremely new to it And it drops me into a No Source Available Page, which lists thisp  blockquote   pstrongCall stack locationstrongp      pIesi.Collections.DLLIesi.Collections.Generic.HashedSet.HashedSet   Line 18p      pstrongSource file informationstrongp      pLocating source for   dCSharpNHNHHgnhibernatesrcIesi.CollectionsGenericHashedSet.cs.

Negative 93364 pI am working on a code example from NSScreenCast that deals with importing to a Core Data application.   httpsgithub.comsubdigitalnsscreencasttreemaster012coredataimportingdataBeerBrowser.  I have the example working for the most part.  I am able to push the refresh button, it parses the json and imports it in to the database.  However, every time I press the refresh button it readds the same data.  I have traced it down to the following code.p  precode Brewery breweryWithServerIdNSIntegerserverId usingManagedObjectContextNSManagedObjectContext moc  NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityName[Brewery entityName]]  [fetchRequest setPredicate[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatserverId  d, serverId]] [fetchRequest setFetchLimit1]  NSError error  nil NSArray results  [moc executeFetchRequestfetchRequest erroramperror] NSLogresults , results if error      NSLogERROR  , [error localizedDescription], [error userInfo]     exit1   if [results count]  0      return nil  NSLogresults objectAtIndex0  , [results objectAtIndex0]  return [results objectAtIndex0]  codepre  pWhat happens is this method is that it tries to see if the item already exists in the database.  If this call returns nil, then the code in MasterViewController adds it again to the database.  I have done some debugging and the serverId does get passed.  Also, the fetchrequest seems to be valid havent been able to debug it to be sure.  As you can see I have put a NSLog for the results, but it returns an empty result.  So, it then goes to if the results count is 0 which it is, it returns nil.  Thus my issue.  I dont see any where else where this issue could be a problem.  Any thoughtsp  pMike Rileyp

Moreover, every line that is added is making the candle be narrower. p  pIve looked around and found this thread in adobes forums a hrefhttpforums.adobe.commessage4095074 relnofollowCandlestickChart problem with  LineSeriesa which describes the exact same problem. p  pUnfortunately, the thread is still not answered.  p  pDoes any one knows a solution for this problem p  pThanks in advance, Ravidp

Negative 93364 pI have a map which I want to use to process and add all its values together with the key as part of the output.p  precodedef map a b c d e f g h codepre  pI want to do for all keys return a contains b c and d  and add the strings together to get the final output a contains b c and d e contains f g and hp  pI initially tried a doseq where my map I tried to destructure the key and the value to k and v and then str k contains  v Then i took the string and spit it into a file.p  pThis did nothing so I added a print statement stating the key and value pairs.  They were printed out but not added to the file.p  pI read up and it seems I need to use a for which is interchangable with doseq but is lazy but crutially returns values.p  pChanging to for instantly gave me wrong amount of parameters error which is strange as I had two destructures and a method body which returned a string.  I fiddled and endded up with a compiling for loop but i get the object as a string instead of the contents.p  pThis is driving me insane.p  pCan anyone help with what I need to dop  pMany thanks,p

Negative 93364 pUsing Wordpress you can add a hook to thecontent. In my code it looks like this.p  precodeaddfilterthecontent, somefunc codepre  pSo, in Wordpress every time there is a post somefunc gets ran. So, lets say somefunc looked like this.p  precodefunction somefunc content       return content . ltdiv idmydivgtltdivgt  codepre  pUsing an ID attribute means there can only be one HTML element. What happens is, this function gets ran for every post there is in the database. That means if I had two posts then I have two divs with the ID mydiv and if I have Javascript that relies on those IDs then the Javascript wont act correctly. Same for CSS.p  pSo, what I need is a way to have this function ran once and no more than once. Anyone know of a way, maybe a wrapper, or a different filter I should be usingp

Negative 93364 pI have a elf binary which has been statically linked to libc. I do not have access to its C code. I would like to use OpenOnload library, which has implementation of sockets in userspace and therefore provides lower latency compared to standard libc versions. OpenOnload implements standard socket api, and overrides libc version using LDPRELOAD. But, since this elf binary is statically linked, it cannot use the OpenOnload version of the socket API.p  pI believe that converting this binary to dynamically link with OpenOnload is possible, with the following stepsp  ol liAdd new Program headers PTINTERP, PTDYNAMIC and PTLOAD.li liAdd entries in PTDYNAMIC to list dependency with libc.li liAdd PLT stubs for required libc functions in the new PTLOAD section.li liModify existing binary code for libc functions to jump to corresponding PLT stubs.li ol  pAs a first cut, I tried just adding 3 PTLOAD segments. New segment headers were added after existing PTLOAD segment headers. Also, vmaddr of existing segments was not modified. File offsets of existing segments were shifted below to next aligned address based on palign. New PTLOAD segments were added in the file at end of the file.p  pAfter rewriting the file, when I ran it, it was loaded properly by the kernel, but then it immediately segfaulted.p  pMy questions arep  ol liIf I just shift the fileoffsets in the elf binary, without modifying the vmaddresses, can it cause any error while running the binaryli liIs it possible to do what I am attempting Has anybody attempted itli ol

Negative 93364 pWhen trying a simple codeCONCATcode I am getting syntax errors. The connection uses a proprietary ODBC driver, which Im sure is the issue, but want to know if there is anything I can do from my end. The following is the query I initially triedp  precodeSELECT CONCATDF, 01, ServiceCode AS RecordID FROM ServiceCodes codepre  pHowever this throws a syntax error near code, ServiceCodecode, no other information. So I triedp  precodeSELECT DF  01  ServiceCode AS RecordID FROM ServiceCodes codepre  pBut this returns the error codetermexpr type not supportedcode which I assume is a specific error from the driver.p  pSo then I triedp  precodeSELECT CONCATCONCATDF, 01, ServiceCode AS RecordID FROM ServiceCodes codepre  pWhich seems to have worked Returning a string like codeDF01MOTcode. This works across all servers and so I added extra fields producing the queryp  precodeSELECT CONCATCONCATDF, 01, ServiceCode AS RecordID, DF AS Environment  FROM ServiceCodes codepre  pThis also seems to have worked, except on 1 server. When running the above query on this one server it will now return codeDF0DFMOcode instead of codeDF01MOTcode, last 2 chars change in each row depending on codeServiceCodecode, adding further fields changes this again such asp  precodeSELECT CONCATCONCATDF, 01, ServiceCode AS RecordID, DF AS Environment, 01 AS SO FROM ServiceCodes codepre  pThis returns codeDF0DF01code for this field in ALL rows.p  pSo why would this be happening Why is it only on one server Driver is the same on all servers but is this an issue with the driver What can I do to get around itp  pEDIT To avoid confusion I have modified the title and tags.

Negative 93364 pWe are trying insert records from a select query in to temporary table, some of the records is missing in the temporary table.  The select statement is having multiple joins and union all which it little complex query.

If we execute select statement alone it returns some count for example  60000    After inserting into the temp table, in temp table the count is around 42000 why is the differencep  pstrongAlso, we have some other observation.  It only happens in its 2nd execution and not its first run.

If it is true, something wrong configuration setup, i guess.h2  pThe code looks like sql  insert in to temptable select x,y,z,.... from xxx,abc,pqr..where.... logial but not real is very complex around 700 lines with multiple joins, inline sub queries, group by etc.  stmt  conn.createStatement rCount stmt.executeUpdatesql strongActual issue is rCount  xxxx  Counttemptable lt countselect x,y,z,.... from xxx,abc,pqr..where....strong why this diffference  some records populated in the select but not inserted in to temp tablep  pAnyone can explainp  pthank you in advance for your efforts and help.p  pShiva.p

Negative 93364 pI have an OpenCV application fed from a webcam stream of an office interior lots of details where I have to find an artificial marker. The marker is a black square on white background. I use Canny to find edges and cvFindContours for contouring, then approxPolyDP and co. for filtering and finding candidates, then use local histogram to filter further, bla bla bla...p  pThis works more or less, but not exactly how I want. FindContours always returns a closed loop, even if Canny creates a nonclosed line. I get a contour walking on both sides of the line forming a loop. For closed edges on the Canny image my marker, I get 2 contours, one on the inside, and an other on the outside.  I have to problems with this operationp  ul lipI get 2 contours for each marker not that seriouspli lipthe most trivial filtering is not usable reject nonclosed contours pli ul  pstrongSo my question is it possible to get nonclosed contours for nonclosed Canny edgesstrong  Or what is the standard way to solve the above 2 issuesp  pCanny is a very good tool, but I need a way convert the 2D bw image, into something easily processable. Something like connected components listing all pixels in walking order of the component. So I can filter for loops, and feed it into approxPolyDP.p  pUpdate I missed some important detail the marker can be in any orientation its not front facing the camera, no right angles, in fact what Im doing is 3D orientation estimation, based on the 2D projection of the marker.p

We would aggregatereduce that data for the daytoday operation, accessing the bigger tables only when the full detail is required.  We would store the historical data as well to perform longerterm analysis. My concern is mostly about memory, disk storage wouldnt be the issue i think if the hot dataset involved in a reportanalysis eats up the whole memory space fast response times needed, not sure about how memory swapping would impact, i would like to know if i can scale somehow instead of reingeneering the reportanalysis process maybe i am biased by the horizontal scaling thing  p  pthanksp

Negative 93364 pSO Community,p  pIm looking to automate some of the metrics that are used at my work using VBA. I am currently trying to read through an array that I have my ticketing raw data stored in and then either store the value as a decimal or percentage. After this is stored in the array, I am attempting to create or update a chart series with the array and display this value as a percent.

Negative 93364 pIm in the process of learning how to use pointers and structs in C. Naturally, Im trying to deliberately break my code to further understand how the language works. Here is some test code that works as I expected it to workp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  struct pair      int x     int y   typedef struct pair pair  void pstruct pair  prototype  int main int argc, char argv       pair spair     int size, i      printf Enter the number of pair to make       scanf d, ampsize      getchar     printf n       spair  pairmalloc size  sizeofpair       for i  0 i lt size i           spair[i].x  i         spair[i].y  i         pstruct spair[i]            getchar      return EXITSUCCESS   void pstruct pair spair       printf nd dn, spair.x, spair.y   codepre  pAs previously stated, this code is functional as far as I can tell.p  pI then decided to modify a part of the code like sop  precodefor i  0 i lt size  3 i       spair[i].x  i     spair[i].y  i     pstruct spair[i]   codepre  pThis modification did not produce the seg fault error that I expected it would. All of the pairs were printed despite me exceeding the buffer I explicitly set when assigning a value to my variable strongsizestrong using the scanf function.p  pAs I understand pointers correct me if Im wrong, a contiguous block of memory of size strongsizesizeofpairstrong is reserved by the memory manager in the heap when I called the malloc function for my pointer of type pair strongspairstrong. What I did was I exceeded the last assigned address of memory when I modified my for loop to the condition strongi lt size  3strong.p  pIf Im understanding this correctly, did my pointer exceed its reserved memory limit and just so happen to be in the clear because nothing adjacent and to the right of it was occupied by other data Is this normal behaviour when overflowing a bufferp  pTo add, I did receive a seg fault when I tested with a for loop condition of strongi lt size  15strong.  The thing is, it still prints the output. As in, it prints the pair 0 0 to pair 24 24 when strongsize  10strong on the screen as per the pstruct function I made. The program crashes by seg fault only after it gets to one of those getchars at the bottom. How on earth could my program assign values to pairs that exceed the buffer, print them on the screen, and then all of a sudden decide to crash on seg fault when it gets to getchar It seemed to have no issue with strongi lt size  3strong despite it still being wrong.p  pFor the record, I also tested this behaviour with a regular pointer arrayp  precodeint size, i, ptr  scanf d, ampsize   ptr  intmalloc size  sizeofint   for i  0 i lt size  15 i      ptr[i]  i codepre  pThis produces the exact same result as above. At strongi lt size  3strong there doesnt seem to be any issue with seg faults.p  pFinally, I tested with an array, toop  precodeint i, array[10]  for i  0 i lt 25 i      array[i]  i codepre  pFor the condition strongi lt 25strong, I get a seg fault without fail. When I change it to strongi lt 15strong, I receive no seg fault.p  pIf I remember correctly, the only difference between an array of pointers and an array is that the memory allocated to an array is located on the stack as opposed to the heap not sure about this. With that in mind, and considering the fact that strongi lt 15strong when strongarray[10]strong doesnt produce any seg faults, why would strongi lt 25strong be an issue Isnt the array at the top of the stack during that for loop Why would it care about 100 extra bytes when it didnt care about 60 extra bytes Why isnt the ceiling for that array buffer all the way to the end of whatever arbitrary chunk of memory is reserved for the whole stackp  pHopefully all of this made sense to whoever decides to read a slightly inebriated mans ramblings.p
Negative 93364 pWell Ive been using temp tables in standard TSQL coding for years and thought I understood them.

As you can see the ReturnPath header contains an email adress that ends in codemywebsite.comcodep  pBut I have only set up dns records for outgoing email spf, domainkey, etc. Not for incoming email. Meaning, my MX records still point to mailservers somewhere else In my case google apps.p  pHow is it possible then that the bounce email arrives at mailgun serversp  pI would have expected to see an email adress ending in codesomemailgunserver.comcode in the codeReturnPathcode header p  pI have been using Amazon SES before, and there they had codeReturnPathcode header ending in codeamazonses.comcodep  pI asked the mailgun support and got this responsep  blockquote   pNick your setup is correct, Mailgun will still automatically handle   the bounces even though your mx records are pointing elsewherep blockquote  pThey just assured me that everything was fine but gave me no explanation which is okay since their job is not to teach me things i dont know but to deliver reliable email service...p  pSo I hope somebody can explain this to me.p  pI hope the point is clear, if not please ask and I will try to clearify my question.p  pEDITp  pOne theory of me is that the bounce email is indeed sent to google mail servers where it is discareded. However that this is redundant since the error response is also sent to the sending mailserver during the process when it opens its tcp conneciton to the target mail server.p  pTo test this theory and since the ReturnPath email is in the form of codebounceSOMETHINGmywebsite.comcode, and google delivers all email, regardless of what comes after the codecode character, to the user in front of it, I went ahead and created the account codebouncemydomain.comcode on google apps.p  pI also tried to send an email to codebouncea801a1.c2b37RECIEVERgmail.commywebsite.comcode.p  pIt made it through to my inbox.p  pNow I expected to recieve bounce traffic in my inbox. So I sent an email to an inexistent hotmail address. I did not recieve email on my google apps inbox, and mailgun sucessfully tracked the bounce.p  pSo... It appears that it does indeed work. I just dont understand why.p  pOne more theory I have is that the mailserver to which the bounce email is delivered is never resolved using its MX records. Rather always the delivering server, in this case codeluna.mailgun.netcode is chosen. The domain ending in the codeReturnPathcode address is just the name of the mailbox on the server, but the domain has nothing to do with the server where the mail is actually delivered.p  pThen it would also make sense to make it like this since it might improve deliverability if the domains of codeFromcode and codeReturnPathcode adress match.p  pHowever this is only a theory. And it would also mean that a mailbox wich is able to recieve bounces, must be on the same server that is used for sending.p  pIn other words it would be impossible to have a mailbox to recieve bounce email adresses that is hosted somewhere else than the actual server sending the mail. But this sounds strange to me as well...p  pI hope somebody can enlighten me. p
Negative 93364 pI am still new to greenlets and gevent, but from what I understand, greenlets yield to other greenlets either on an explicit yield statement, or on a blocking IO operation. But are writes to stdout using a print statement blocking And what about using the logging module to write to stdout, stderr, or a file on a local disk, or NFSp  pCan a call to a print statement or a logging method cause a greenlet switchp

Negative 93364 pIs anyone else seeing scroll bars on infowindows since the new visual refresh Ive got horizontal AND vertical scroll bars now, on initial page load only. It seems like the infowindow isnt adjusting to the height of my content, therefore generating a vertical scroll bar. The vertical scroll bar reduces the max width, so a horizontal scroll bar is also generated.p  pThis only happens on initial page load, on the infowindow that autoopens. Any infowindows manually clicked by the user do not have this problem.p  pI know I can remove scroll bars by assigning a fixed height and width to my content div, but Id rather not have a fixed height. After all, the infowindows display perfectly if they are userclicked. Only the autoopen displays incorrectly.p  pAny ideas how to fix thisp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srchttpmaps.google.commapsapijssensorfalsegtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   var centerLat  27.946222681465837   var centerLon  82.45767116546631   var zoomLevel  14   var poiName  Tampa Convention Center   var poiLat  27.94194340459138   var poiLon  82.45656609535217   var properties  [ [Embassy Suites Tampa  Downtown Convention Center, 27.9422467033296, 82.4550640583038, 513 South Florida Avenue, Tampa, FL 33602 US , httpreservations.tampaconventioncenterhotels.comhotel1002737411344727O.html, The new Embassy Suites Tampa  Downtown Convention Center is located in the heart of the downtown Tampa business and financial center and connected to, 3], [Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel, 27.9462700700723, 82.4593234062194, 200 North Ashley Street, Tampa, FL 33602 US , httpreservations.tampaconventioncenterhotels.comhotel1002737410231645O.html, Live it up and spend a relaxing day along the riverfront or lounging by the pool at this Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk, 4], [Hyatt Regency Tampa, 27.9462226814658, 82.4576711654663, 211 North Tampa Street, Tampa, FL 33602 US , httpreservations.tampaconventioncenterhotels.comhotel1002737410084987O.html, Immerse yourself in the endless activity that surrounds Hyatt Regency Tampa, ideally located in the heart of the city, 3], [Westin Tampa Harbour Island, 27.9379246159165, 82.4548253417015, 725 South Harbour Island Boulevard, Tampa, FL 33602 US , httpreservations.tampaconventioncenterhotels.comhotel1002737410000868O.html, Escape to this resortlike atmosphere at the Westin Tampa Harbour Island situated on a unique island in downtown Tampa, 4], [Marriott Execustay the Loft At Channelside, 27.9498075708323, 82.4464809894561, 217 12th Street, Tampa, FL 33602 US , httpreservations.tampaconventioncenterhotels.comhotel1002737411406326O.html, Hotel amenities include nonsmoking rooms, room service, highspeed internet, kitchenette, interior corridors.

Which should be used when  In my opinion sampling parameters like GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER , GLTEXTUREWRAPR, etc should only be applicable to sampler glSamplerParameter and not to glTexParameter.p  pPlease help me understand the difference between two.p

Negative 93364 pI am currently facing a problem on facebook and the new open graph stuff. I set up an application that allows for posting stories with a custom action and a custom type search  real estate.p  pIn the story attachment configuration dialog layout item I tried to add captions other than the one that is displayed by default. It is working quite well expect for the fact that the preview and actual post differ in layout. The preview shows each caption on a new line, while the actual post shows all captions merged into one line without line breaks. I wonder if this is the desired behaviour. At least Id like to have them on seperate lines.p  pThe data to be shown in the story is derived from the OG meta tags that are included in the referenced webpage. Thus I am not sure if the solutions discussed on stackoverflow e.g. putting center tags in between, inserting line feeds etc. works here.p  pJust as an additional information I am using Spring Social to post the story.p  pI hope anyone has an idea how to show the captions in seperate line in actual posted stories.p  pThanks...p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comfI1me3P.png altStory  Edit Attachments Dialog strongemStory  Edit Attachments Dialogemstrongp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comHZ0s3fg.png altStory  Preview One To One strongemStory  Preview  Configurationemstrongp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.compkOGCVK.png altStory  Actual Postp  pemstrongStory  Actual Postemstrongp  pI think it doesnt matter how the OG meta tags are defined in the webpage as for the use case shown here, I used constant strings and no objectaction properties.p  pUsing html tags or line feeds in the caption input fields does not affect the layout, as all the input is escaped.p  pI hope this gives you better insight to what I tried to explain first.p

Negative 93364 pIm trying to make some sort of plugin system for asp.net webforms using MEF.p  pSo far Ive come with a solution where the host website will search in its plugin folder to load other websites called strongModulestrong. A module plugin is just another website project, so it has its own assemblies in its strongbinstrong subfolder.p  pAs you certainly already know, an ASP.NET application wont load dll outside its strongbinstrong folder. So if I try to access a module page eg strongpluginsMyModulePage.aspxstrong. Ill get an error saying that the server cant load the assembly strongMyModulestrong. I can throw the modules assembly in the main strongbinstrong folder and everything will work, but I would like to keep all the module files in the same folder.p  pSo Im looking for a way to load assemblies outside the strongbinstrong folder. Ive tried messing with the web.config file but couldnt come with a working solution.p  pThen I came accross the strongBuildManagerstrong class and wrote this code p  precodestring pluginPath  Path.CombineAppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, plugins foreach string f in Directory.GetDirectoriespluginPath      string binPath  Path.Combinef, bin     if Directory.ExistsbinPath              foreach String file in Directory.GetFilesbinPath, .dll                      Assembly a  Assembly.LoadFromfile             BuildManager.AddReferencedAssemblya                codepre  pIt search the strongpluginstrong folder for any other subfolder containing a strongbinstrong folder and load the corresponding assemblies using the strongBuildManagerstrong. To make this code works I have to call it in the strongPreApplicationStartMethodstrong of the strongglobal.aspxstrong assembly.p  pNow when I navigate to the plugin page strongpluginMyModulePage.aspxstrong it wont give me the previous error but the page is blank. Ive checked the source and there is no html, nothing. Ive tried to debug the page but the strongPageLoadstrong method is never called. So I guess somehow the code behind strongPage.aspxstrong is never called.p  pAny idea p  pThanks.p  pEdit p  pSo after searching a bit more I found a solution there p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1199237buildmanagerresolvingpageinheritanceBuildManager Resolving Page Inheritanceap  pWhen I load a module assembly, I store its reference in a dictionnay. Then in the event handler to strongAppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolvestrong I return the corresponding module assembly.p

Negative 93364 pIve spent the past couple of days learning C, but I just came across something that I hadnt seen in the books nor after doing some research on Google.p  pAs far as I know, a macro is a statement or variable name that is preceded by codedefinecode hat allows certain values or functions to be specified later and inserted where desired automatically.p  pHowever, Ive come across a function that is declared inside a clas and not preceded by codedefinecode and it is called a macro. The function is from MFC and is called codeDECLAREMESSAGEMAPcode. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary08ea0k43.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary08ea0k43.aspxap  pCan someone explain what this type of macro is what is it called so I could further research it and what does it meanp
Negative 93364 pI have two models, codeFlyerItemcode and codeProductcode. If you think of a flyer for an electronics store it might show a TV on sale. For this particular case, I suppose that a flyer item advertises one product.p  pIve defined the model for the flyer item like thisp  precodeclass FlyerItem lt ActiveRecordBase   hasone product end codepre  pThe migration looks like thisp  precodeclass CreateFlyerItems lt ActiveRecordMigration   def change     createtable flyeritems, primarykey gt flyeritemid do t       t.references product     end   end end codepre  pThen in my View I try to access a particular instance of an item like thisp  precodelt FlyerItem.find do item gt   ltpgtlt item.product gtltpgt lt end gt codepre  pHowever rails throws an exceptionp  precodePGUndefinedColumn ERROR  column products.flyeritemid does not exist LINE 1 SELECT  products. FROM products  WHERE products.flye...                                                       SELECT  products. FROM products  WHERE products.flyeritemid  1  ORDER BY products.productid ASC LIMIT  codepre  pWhich is expected, because a product really has nothing to do with a flyer item, so the Product table doesnt and shouldnt have that column.p  pWhat I really want to say is something likep  pSELECT  FROM flyeritems WHERE flyeritems.productid  products.productidp  pWhat kind of association would I use herebr Is an association even the correct approach p  pA flyer must have one product, but a product does not necessarily need to be assigned to any flyers.p

Negative 93364 pIm wondering if opennlp can be used to extract very specific context when using the namefinder api.p  pFor example, if i have 2 sentencesp  blockquote   pJane Smith, 26, was taken into custody for stealing biscuits at her local Sainsburies.p      pJane Smith, 26, was awarded a medal of honour for bravery.p blockquote  pIn this situation, i would like opennlp to detect not just the sentence structure finding Jane Smith in both sentences, but also conclude that when the words custody, stealing is used in the same sentence, then this gives a different context to the second sentence. Therefore if i train the first sentence to be [STARToffender] Jane Smith [END] and second [STARThero] Jane Smith [END], there will be some decision at some point based on the words within the sentence i train.p  pI know Opennlp uses feature extraction from what ive read it looks at sentence structure  i could be wrong here, but i wonder if there is also some dictionary analysis as well, if i train enough of these sentences, will i eventually get good a good context split p  pIf there isnt, can you suggest any way forward which is scalable I want to try and keep with Opennlp because of the license.p

Am I right in thinking codeCharacter code is just a pointer to a Character array Ive tried many different combinations for the parameters and cant seem to get it right. Sometimes when I call the routine it segfaults, other times PHP shows no error but the subroutine has no effect.p  pDue to the fact that I am able to call routines with int and double parameters from my extension, and that this routine works fine when called from Fortran, I think it must be the way Im passing the string, but just cant work out the correct way.p

Negative 93364 pIm pretty sure every web developer is aware that the content of webpages can be edited using the Inspect Element function of our browsers. p  pFor example, I can actually edit the value of a forms action attribute, submit it immediately without refreshing and have the forms values be posted to the URL equivalent to the new value I edited.p  pThis poses a serious loophole to my implementation of a page commenting functionality similar to Facebook. I use CodeIgniter. What I do is I pass the ID of the page where the user is commenting as a parameter in the URL.p  precodeltphp  echo formopenbaseurl.pagesprocesscomment.pageid, attributes  gt codepre  pThe resulting markup looks like thisp  precodeltform actionhttplocalhostmyprojectindex.phppagesprocesscomment3 methodpost acceptcharsetutf8 idcomment namecommentgt     lttextarea namecommentcontentgtlttextareagt     ltinput typesubmit idpost namepost valuepost gt ltformgt codepre  pThe danger of this implementation is that I can edit the pageid which is 3, to something else, and when I submit the comment, it would posted to a different page since it references a different pageid.

Negative 93364 pIn a previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20203056isthereastandardhaskellfunctionforreturnabquestiona, I tried to ask about how to mix pure and monadic functions by piping them together, but because I may have worded my question wrong and my example was too simplistic, I think the discussion went the wrong direction, so I think Ill try again.p  pHere is an example function that mixes pure and monadic filters. In this example, there are some pure filters sequenced inbetween monadic filters to try to reduce the amount of work.p  precodefindFiles target     getDirectoryContents target                    gtgt   return . filter not .

No need for temporary variables, codefmapcode, codeltgtcode or the like. p  pIdeally, I can get rid of the codereturncodes to make it cleaner. I had the idea of using some operatorp  precodegt  Monad m gt a gt a gt m b gt m b a gt b  return a gtgt b codepre  pBut I dont know how to write this function to avoid operator precedence problems. Does this already exist It is similar to codeltgtcode but the other direction. If not, how do I make this operator workp  pMore generally, is there a good way to write code in this piping fashion, or need I settle for codefmapcodes and temporary variables like as described in my previous questionp

Negative 93364 pI am attempting to parse with regex a series of lines of psudeoassembly code that are the following formatsp  precodeoptionallabel  requiredinstruction    optionalparameter, optionalparameter codepre  pAnd actual example looks a bit more likep  precodePRINTLOOP   MOV R6, R7 CMP R6, R9 TRP 1 BLK codepre  pWhere MOV,CMP,BLK and BRZ are instructions.p  pWhitespace between tokens can be any number of spaces or tabs, labels must start at the beginning of a line while instructions can either start at the beginning or have any amount of leading spaces or tabs.p  pI need to get at each bit of it individually so it is important that the regex groups it properly. I am currently trying to use this patternp  precode    ltlabelgt[w][ t]ltoperatorgt[w][ t]ltoperand1gt[w],[ t]ltopenparengtltoperand2gt[][w]ltcloseparengt codepre  pThis pattern has worked fine until now because there was always at least one parameter, but now I have zero parameter instructions which dont fit in nicely to this. I tried to tweak the pattern to be the followingp  precode    ltlabelgt[w][ t]ltoperatorgt[w][ t]ltoperand1gt[w],[ t]ltopenparengtltoperand2gt[][w]ltcloseparengt codepre  pSo that the space after the instructionoperator isnt mandatory but I found that this made things ambiguous enough that the instruction is perceived to be the label in many instructions. For examplep  precode    LDB     R0,      lM codepre  pIs understood as label LDB, Instruction R0 and neither operand is recognized.p  pIs their a way to either force the operator section to be checked first so that that part of the string is prioritized, resources that will explain where I am going wrong in all this, or a regex pattern that will do what I am looking forp

Negative 93364 pIm using a subroutine to output an array gathered from a previous function. After running my program and only calling the subroutine once, my intended file name, testf.txt, is given as testf.txt .

When I do multiple calls, the names of the the files add onto one another. Intended, testf.txt testg.txt testh.txt, given, testf.txttestg testg.txttesth and testh.txt. The content is fine, the name being the only issue.

Negative 93364 pIn a small Program users insert multiple typed formulas and wire them together in order to create a system of simultaneous equations. And Id like to introduce runtime type checking, so as to report an error if dimensions do not matchp  pBasical the types can be anything, e.g. codePersons, Money, MoneyPeriod, m2s2code etc, and are entered as strings at runtimep  pI read about HindleyMilner type inference, but thought that its a bit overblown. p  pMy idea was to rely on two rules p  pfirst tokenize, thenp  precodeIf a  b or ab the dimensions must match [a]  [b] codepre  pif ab then the dimensions are expanded or contracted in the sense that you keep track of the count of individual dimensions, e.g p  precodePersonYear  MoneyYear  MoneyYear2 gt Money2 Person1 Year2  Year1 codepre  pthen subtract individual counts, thus leaving codeMoney2 Person1 Year1code as codefinal typecode p  pthis could be implemented as a tree walker, where the dimensional contraints are tested per node then simplifying tho yield the final answerp  pIs this a good way to solve this issuep

Negative 93364 pFirst of all, I am new to Spring. p  pSuppose you are developing a web app and you want to do an incontainer functional testing of a http request that should get a response of string Hello, World. For example, lets say the web app will be deployed to Tomcat. What I want to achieve is like this when the test starts, the app will be deployed to some kind of embedded Tomcat. Then, you can use an HTTP client e.g., a Jersey client to send a request and test the response.p  pI know Arquillian can do this sort of thing with an embedded application server. But I dont know if there is an equivalent in the Spring world. If there is, I would very much like to know. p  pThank you very much.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter a bit of googling, I found a pattern of using embedded Tomcat for testing like belowp  precode EmbeddedTomcatTestCase.java public abstract class EmbeddedTomcatTestCase      private Tomcat tomcat      Before     public void setup          this.tomcat  new Tomcat          setup steps go here          this.tomcat.start         this.tomcat.getServer.await           After     public void teardown          this.tomcat.stop         ConcreteTest.java public class ConcreteTest extends EmbeddedTomcatTestCase       tests go here  codepre  pOne question I have about above code is that why codeBeforecode but not codeBeforeClasscode. Isnt it expensive to start and stop a tomcat server for every test method Another related question is, for codeBeforeClasscode, will the tomcat server be created only once as with the EmbeddedTomcatTestCase class That seems to be mostly a desirable effect, but are there exceptions Most importantly, is there a simpler way than the code above Thanks.p

Negative 93364 pI have a project using submodule that I need to keep in sync between two servers, each with a full set of repositories. The simplest solution, of course, is to have each developer add both remotes to each repo, and always push to both. But inevitably thats errorprone, and they forget to delete branches, and who knows what other mistakes are made.p  pThe branches dont need to be kept in sync immediately, so I was thinking of using some type of cron job to fetch from one and push to the other all development is done is one the second is currently being used almost like a backup. p  pI thought about using something likep  precodefor b in git branch r  grep ltget only one remotes branchesgt do     git updateref refsheadsb originb done git push all origin2 codepre  pwithin a codegit submodule foreachcode, but Im not sure if this is the best way to do it.p  pI also didnt find an easy way to make sure that deleted branches in codeorigincode are also deleted in codeorigin2code for this purpose, any branch that is not present in codeorigincode can be assumed to be have been deleted.p  pIts also complicated slightly by the case of what happens ifwhen someone adds a new submodule to a branch of the superproject, but those cases are rare enough that I can handle them manually, I suppose.p  pI admit I dont fully understand the difference in a bare repository and a clone I suspect a bare repo can help me somehow here, but if I clone the superproject as a bare repo, I dont see how to get the submodules themselves though perhaps thats related to the paragraph above without being on a branch, theres no meaning to the submodules.p  pMight it be wiser to just mirror each repo individually without trying to do so using submodule foreachp  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 93364 pIm working in an API that needs to return a list of financial transactions.

Originally, they want to paginate in groups of 50 records, but Ive got them to do it on date ranges believing that I can do it more efficiently in the database than using offset and limits.p  pMy intent is to create an index on each of these tables like thisp  precodeCREATE INDEX idxtable1accountcreated ON table1accountid, created desc ALTER TABLE table1 CLUSTER ON idxtable1accountcreated codepre  pThen finally to create a view to union all of the records from the 6 tables into one list and then obviously the records from the 6 tables will need to be resorted to come up with a unified list in the correct order.

Since the records are going to have to be resorted by the view anyway is there any reason to do specify the individual indexes as created desc  And does sorting this way have any penalties when periodicially calling codeCLUSTERcodep  pIve done some googling and reading but cant really seem to find any information that answers how this clustering is going to work.p  pUsing PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku.p

Negative 93364 pIm working through loading javascript dependencies and Im trying to answer a question about how getScript works.p  pIve built loading code that will automatically load scripts using getScript, basically by looping through an array of filepaths and calling getScript on each one.p  pSince getScript runs asynchronously, I had expected no guarantee which file would finish loading first and, presumably, begin executing in the main thread.p  pHowever, it appears that if I make multiple calls to getScript, the calls are queued internally, such that later files do not begin loading until the earlier files have completed.  That is, my main function certainly runs asynchronously to getScript, but even if I load a very large file first and a small file last, the large file always executes first.p  pGiven that the order of execution never changes up even when I load a very large file before a smaller one, Im left to assume that while getScript executes asynchronously with the main execution thread, it does not execute asynchronously with itself...p  pI hope that makes enough sense that someone can clarify this for me...p

Negative 93364 pIm working on a simple game using a Java Applet, and I cant seem to get the screen to move properly with my player object. The problem seems to be the result of the socalled doublebuffer that is recommended in many guides for use with Applets. I copied the implementation of the double buffer from one such guide but as far as I understand it the point is to have two separate objects of the Java Graphics class, where one draws all the game objects etc. offscreen and then the other displays that image on screen.p  pThe relevant parts of code from the Level class which is the main class of my Appletp  precodepublic class Level extends Applet implements Runnable, KeyListener       public Image offscreen     public Graphics d     private Thread th      also a bunch of game mechanic related stuff Im not including here      public void init         th  new Threadthis         th.start         offscreen  createImage480,800         d  offscreen.getGraphics         initObjects  a method that intialises all game objects to be drawn          again, a bunch of other nonimportant stuff           public void run   run is the method an Applet automatically calls after init is done, for me it basically contains the game     loop which works just fine apart from the camera and is ran 60 times per second using Thread.sleep       offSetY is set here as the player moves up or down the camera only needs to scroll on the yaxis     as offSetY  player.y 750 The player is supposed to always be 50 pixels from the bottom of the screen which is 800 pixels high.     The purpose of offSetY is to provide the delta of the players position on y axis since the last update in order to     determine in which direction and how much we need to move the screen.      repaint  calls update, which is where the truly relevant part starts.       public void updateGraphics g         d.clearRect0, 0, 480, 800  clears the offscreen area of whatever was there last time update was called         d.drawImagebackground, 0, 0, this  draws the background image on the offscreen area         g.translate0, offSetY  translate to change coordinates according to player movement, offSetY is determined by player position         in the game loop and is getting the correct value as many units as the player has moved on the Y axis so far         paintd         g.drawImageoffscreen, 0, 0, this  after paint has drawn everything offscreen, the graphics object g draws that image on the screen           public void paintGraphics d         d.translate0, offSetY  this is where things get complicated, Ill discuss this translate in more detail below the code         d.drawImagebackground, 0, 0, this  Im not entirely sure why the background is drawn both here and in the on screen Graphics object,         its inherited from the double buffer example. Removing it seems to have no effect on anything.           I have a forloop drawing all my game objects here. Ive tested this separately and it works just fine without the translates         e.g. if Im moving the objects down instead of moving the screen.        codepre  pSo, essentially my problem is that if I only have the codetranslatecode in codeupdatecode which moves the origin of the onscreen stuff it works perfectly for everything that is visible on the original area of the screen but as soon as objects out of that area get drawn things get funky. Also if the player object is moved outside these boundaries it appears only as a ghost, getting drawn at the coordinates where it entered every frame instead of where it actually is sideways movement is not shown but if you come back to the working area the player position has changed on the xaxis. Imgur album with some images a hrefhttpimgur.coma2FchF relnofollowherea, orange balloon is the player object, everything else is other game objects.p  pOn the other hand, if I add the other translate inside paint, the problem becomes apparent doubledipping of the translate function, meaning that the screen is moved far faster than the player moves and the movement does not stop even if the player is no longer moving. This is frankly quite perplexing to me, as the value of offSetY should always be dependant on the players position and therefore selfcorrecting if the player is left behind of the screen. Imgur album with some pics a hrefhttpimgur.coma4kFo9 relnofollowherea.p  pAny ideas on how to implement this properly are welcome, or if someone knows a different way to implement the same functionality. Feel free to ask any further questions and Ill try to provide answers ASAP.p

Negative 93364 pI use CSS3 transform to move the content of my website to show the menu.p  pThe problem is on the mobile. After a user opens the menu with the help of CSS3 transform the user then can move the content and some times part of the content is shown in the viewport.

Negative 93364 pIn order to center a scaling or a rotation you need to rely on a modifier using the strongoriginstrong property i.e. codeorigin[0.5,0.5]codep  pUnfortunately it seems that origin will not only set the reference center point of the surface but also translate it to some place relative to its parent.p  pNow imagine the following case I would like to strongcreate a button surfacestrong and to place it strongin the upper left cornerstrong default with origin[0,0]. While triggering an action, strongthe surface should scalestrong or rotate strongfrom its centerstrong and not from this upper left corner which would be the default behaviour.p  pObviously I could make it work by creating a custom transform matrix multiplying a translation and a scaling matrix in order to center the surface.p  pHowever I cannot imagine there is no better famo.us way of doing this, I tried to make a container read a view, add the surface to the view through a centred modifier then add this view to the context through another modifier with origin [0,0] but no way any advise on the pattern to use p

Negative 93364 pIm trying to load a temporary image tag. Once that tag is done loading the image, I will set the src for the imgmain to the src of the temporary image element.  The thing is, the temporary image is successfully loading it shows up on the screen, but the onload handler doesnt seem to fire. I never get my Image is done loading msg.  I dont see how the temporary image can show up on the page, but not trigger its onload handler would this happen if the browser is using a cached version of the image But, Im pretty sure I cleared the cache, anyway..  By the way, Ive also tried code like B below. But that didnt seem to work either.  Also, Im using Aptana Studio and loading my pages into my local WAMP server.  I dont know if that makes any difference. Also, the urls that Im assigning to the src are document relative like imagesimage1.jpg.p  pI would appreciate any advice anyone might have.

The virtual machine has IIS installed on it.p  pIm not using the Azure Web Sites feature because it does not support virtual networks, yet, and thus cannot be configured to connect to a SQL Server database, running on an Azure VM, using a private LAN IP. So, this publish question does not pertain to the simpler publishtoazurewebsites feature.p  pThe GUI for Visual Studios publish feature first starts with a prompt to select my target publish destination. On this prompt, I choose to publish to a Windows Azure Virtual Machine. Its brings up a prompt that has a dropdown menu in which I expected to be able to select my existing virtual machine.

Negative 93364 pI am reading whats happening when the CLR executes the SkipWhile method. For example, lets take thatp  precodeIListltstringgt numbers  new Listltstringgt    One,Two,Three, Four,Five  var result  numbers.SkipWhilenumber gt number.Length  3 result.ToList.ForEachnumber gt Console.WriteLinenumber codepre  pCLR will do these stepsp  pThe C compiler constructs a method codeltMaingtb1code using the anonymous method codenumber gt number.Length  3code in the compile time. The CLR will instantiate an instance of codeMulticastDelegatecode using the codeltMaingtb1code method as a predicate to the codeSkipWhilecode. The CLR instantiates an instance of the codeSkipWhileIteratorcode iterator using the original list and the predicate codeltMaingtb1code. Due to the deferred execution, the codeSkipWhileIteratorcode will not execute until the codeCLRcode calls the codeToListcode or uses the codeForEachcode method to iterate through. The CLR executes the codeToListcode method over the codeSkipWhileIteratorcode return from the codeSkipWhilecode method, and inside the codeSkipWhileIteratorcode, the codeCLRcode loops through the original list one by one and executes the predicate over each of the items. If the predicate returns false, then the codeSkipWhileIteratorcode returns that item as a result of the codeSkipWhilecode method or if it returns true, then it continues through the list until it finishes.p  pSo far, everything is ok.p  pBut, then I have watched implementation of the codeSkipWhileIteratorcode from a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.comSystem.CoreSystemLinqEnumerable.cs2a0646c99b695effreferences relnofollowthis web sitea.p  precode static IEnumerableltTSourcegt SkipWhileIteratorltTSourcegtIEnumerableltTSourcegt source, FuncltTSource, boolgt predicate         bool yielding  false        foreach TSource element in source            if yielding ampamp predicateelement yielding  true           if yielding yield return element           codepre  pBut, isnt it false In my opinion second if statement must be like thatp  precode if yielding yieldingfalse yield return element codepre  pcodeYieldingcodes value strongmust set to falsestrong in second if, otherwise it will not get inside the first if statement if the value is True.p  pThanks.p

Negative 93364 pI currently put this at the top of all my .py filesp  precode  coding utf8  codepre  pIve been taught this for years as best practice. To me the idea of enforcing UTF8 by default makes sense, especially with my tests containing a lot of Unicode characters. It allows me to write Unicode literals in my code directly.p  pHowever, I recently was told that forcing the source encoding to UTF8 can be bad for crossplatform compatibility, since Windows doesnt default to UTF8. I believe its not just an issue with code editors, but more of an issue with treating Unicode the same everywhere. But I dont fully understand the issue.p  pBoth approaches seem to have strong arguments. In more detail, what are the benefits of enforcingnot enforcing a source encoding What are the problemsp

Negative 93364 h1Questionh1  pI am in the process of porting my codeweb.pycode app from its built in server to Apache2 using codemodwsgicode.  All is well and the code executes, except for the sessions.p  pFirstly, note that the sessions work fine with the old server.  I am testing as follows I render a page called codelayoutcode which has the lines p  precodesession loggedIn in session codepre  pDue to the fact that codesessioncode which is a codeweb.sessions.Sessioncode is initialised with codeinitializerloggedIn  Falsecode, I expect the second line to always render as True.  This it does with the default server.p  pHowever, on Apache2 with modwsgi, it is not the case.  If I restart apache, then it renders as True, but subsequent refreshes of the page render as False.p  pI understand that sometimes the codecookiepathcode can be the culprit, but have set that to codecode, and am unsure of what else could be the problem.p  h2Codeh2  h3codeetcapache2apache2.confcodeh3  precodeLoadModule wsgimodule modulesmodwsgi.so  WSGIScriptAlias  varwwwmyappwebUtils.py AddType texthtml .py ltDirectory varwwwmyappgt         Order deny,allow         Allow from all ltDirectorygt codepre  h3codevarwwwmyappwebUtils.pycodeh3  precodeimport sys,os abspath  os.path.dirnamefile or . sys.path.appendabspath os.chdirabspath  import web ...

Negative 93364 pI am stumped on an error in my excel program that fails to process singular digits in case 3 in my switch statement.  I pass in number sequences from an excel worksheet cell and the program sorts the numbers out and will eventually do stuff assuming I can get the program to read case 3 singular digits and write the string like the double digits in case 3 do.  I will attach the program with comments.  Everything works fine, except when passing in a singular digit in a number sequence in the third case, like 012, 2 being the third case.  0120 will work, however.

Negative 93364 pi have a play 2.3 application that I want to test. This application has a Global.java class that extends GlobalSettings in order to start a recurring Akka task every 5minutes.p  pDuring testing I dont want the task to be scheduled since it creates several issues and I dont need it.p  pTherefore I would like to override the GlobalSettings.p  pBy reading the documentation, it looks like it should be possible to use a FakeApplication for that. However I tried to do that in several ways and the framework still runs my default global settings.p  pI created a base class for my tests that looks like thisp  precodepublic class BaseTest   extends WithApplication    protected FakeApplication provideFakeApplication        return fakeApplicationinMemoryDatabasetest, new GlobalSettings     codepre  pAccording to the documentation, if a test class extends WithApplication a fake application should automatically start for me, with the configuration provided. Disregarding if this happens or not, even before the testing methods are called, the default global settings trigger. The new Global doesnt override the default.p  pI also tried to manually start the fakeApplication using a BeforeClass annotation, with no success.p  pI am running the tests with the activator test command.p  pIt looks like that the fakeApplication is indeed used for each test, but before even the first test starts, the main application is started and its global triggered. And thats what I dont want it to happen.p  pAm I doing something wrong or is it a bug in play if it is a bug, is there a workaround p  pstrongEDITstrong I just noticed that even the database settings dont get overridden correctly. I normally use a h2 file database for developing, but i want a inmemory, different one for testing. However by using the code above doesnt change the database used, and therefore my tests run against my file DB.p  pI also tried something like thisp  precode  Test   public void testMyTest        runningfakeApplicationinMemoryDatabasetest2,  gt        TESTING CODE THAT USES DB         codepre  pand still any query inside the body runs against the DB configured in the config file, not the inmemory database.p  pstrongEditstrong Chafik solution kind of worked for me, since by specifying a different config file in the build.sbt file I managed to override my settings. Things are still really wierd though 1Now if from my fakeApplication constructor I try to override the GlobalSettings by passing a new instance in helper method, the settings are correctly overridden, while before I could not at all override the main one 2If I revert my change and dont supply a test conf file, I can still override the globalsettings. That is, the behaviour is different than it used to be initially.p  pSomething is definitely strange around the test command, its configuration, running scope, and the way fakeApplication override the configuration, andor the documentation about it si definitely unclear and lacking. However since at least I achieved what I wanted to do Ill still consider the answer solved.p

Negative 93364 pIn my grails application I had a custom redirect for 404. Whenever the application used to hit a 404, it used to log the request.forwardURI and redirect the user to a 404 page. But after upgrading to wildfly8.0.0also tried 8.1.0 and 9.0.0alpha, the application doesnt log the actual URI request.forwardURI.brp  pHowever, in the request dump I see the actual URI that was requested. I believe, it might not be a grails problem as the actual request is getting logged in jboss4 and the jbosseap6.2. The Request class in wildfly is HttpServletRequestImpl, whereas in older version it was ApplicationHttpRequest.brp  pI have copied the war into a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshtrzzmfp7pp5ut0fAADBDczE4fx1oJGDUAw8FxAqadl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comshtrzzmfp7pp5ut0fAADBDczE4fx1oJGDUAw8FxAqadl0a.

Negative 93364 pI have a Process and a ProcessDLQ in Oracle. Messages which can not be processed will be forwarded to DLQ after max retry count. Each message has also a custom header with a cycle count.p  pWhat I would like to do in PLSQL is to enqueue all messages back to the Process queue which have a cycleCount less than X. I didnt find a way to pass a message selector.  Is there a way to just browse the messages without dequeuing them I would only dequeue when the criteria matches.

Negative 93364 pI am new the Android development 3 weeks.p  pId like to create an Activity that allows the user to scroll through a list of items.

Negative 93364 pGood Morning, p  pIm refactoring a script which will have literally dozens to hundreds of user configurable parameters. p  pThe first step is, of course, to implement a GUI with checkboxes for which parameters to turn on and off, and a few entry boxes for specific configuration parameters, p  pMy initial thought is to use something like Pythons ConfigParser module, with two files. One default.cfg which does not change so the configuration can be reset and a second file which is dynamically changed based on whats selectedentered into the GUI so its persistent. p  pIm wondering if theres a more elegant and pythonic way to accomplish this. p  pThanksp

Negative 93364 pI have a very simple setup of a codeCATiledLayercode contained in a codeNSScrollViewcode which has two codeCIFiltercode added codeCIColorControlscode, codeCIColorMapcode via the codefilterscode property. When zooming in I increase the width and that works well and as expected as long as the codeCATiledLayercode has a width of 12000 pixels or less. p  pAs soon as it is larger than 12000pixels it stops requesting tiles above 12000pixels and doesnt draw above 12000px.p  pIf I remove the filters, it works as expected. I couldnt find any information on maximum layer size when used with codeCIFilterscode  is there anything I am missingp

Negative 93364 pI have a database of elements with a parameter that specifies the ordering, with properties likep  precode ID  Name  Order codepre  pLets say order is an integer  it is easy to query and order by Order. However, if I want to insert a new element in between this list, I have to go renumber everything below it  worst case scenario is when I want to push an element to the top. p  pSo I have this idea by ordering elements by a chain. That is, I have one table with my Elements p  precodeID Name codepre  pAnd then I have a second table with Edges p  precodeStartNode EndNode codepre  pAnd this just defines which element is connected to which other element. This way, when I want to insert an element, I just need to remove an edge and put in another one  I dont need to reorder the whole list. p  pBut is there an efficient way to query out to get an ordered list from these two tables Does this approach have some sort of name p

Negative 93364 pI am facing iPhone Battery Drain problem. In my app, I am using the accelerometer to count the steps.

Negative 93364 pI am trying to set dependencies in the Boost Unit Testing Framework. I have found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17604111doestheboosttestingframeworksupporttestdependenciesthis threada tbat has an example of how to use the testunitdependson method. So far so good, I can write some magickery around that to smooth it out. However, the UTF doesnt honor test dependencies during execution.p  pScenario A BOOSTAUTOTESTCASE A is declared before another B, and A dependson B Excpected desired outcome The framework detects the dependency and runs B first, and then A if B succeeded. Actual Outcome A is skipped because B, which has not run yet, has failed i.e. nofalse result yet.p  pNow, my idea was to do a topological sort on the test cases  suites and then run them in the sorted order. For that, I created a testtreevisitor to walk the suites and determine the order of the mmembers testsuite member.p  pHowever, mmembers is protected and not accessible via methods.

Negative 93364 pWhen a user opens my website I subscribe them to their room, for example roomUSERNAME. So if a user has many tabs open all are subscribed to this room.

Negative 93364 pOur clients use RDP sessions created by clicking a button on our site which uses the old MSRDP.cab file called in a webpage. We also utilize Virtual channels using a custom dll. Both our dll and the MSRDP.ocx are loaded through the object tag and cab files using VBScript.p  pAs you might know, the orginal RDP connection script was written in VBScript. Apparently the ActiveX control will only work if called using VBScript. That has been working for over a decade. However the newer IE browsers and virtually all of the other browsers do not support VBScript.p  pI realize that I can call the new RDP program mstsc.exe from Javascript for a straight connection. However, we also pass information to the old ocx like the plugin parameters in Advancedsettings which include our dll that uses virtual channels. In addition, we pass the domain and username.p  pMaybe Im searching in all the wrong places but Im turning up no answers in trying to find how to run this ocx in javascript or another solution that would work. Im thinking there has to be a replacement out there that Im overlooking.p  pWe are able to force our clients to use IE so we are currently having our clients with IE versions over 10 to use compatibility mode. However Im sure at some point this may no longer work.p  pHas anyone out there had a similar problem that you have found a solution for Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks p

Negative 93364 pFrom what Ive gathered, the ask pattern is considered a bad practice and should be avoided. Instead, the recommended pattern is the actor per request model. However, this doesnt make sense to me, as the ask pattern does exactly this  it creates a lightweight actor per request. So why is this then considered bad, especially when futures are far more composable and are able to more elegantly handle the collation of multiple sendreceivesp

I F8d through the procedure and I can tell that it works well for one selection then moves down 13 rows and does the next selection, BUT Im not sure how to make it continuously move through the data. I need for it to always select 11 rows, do the procedure then count thirteen rows down and do it again until it hits an empty row. Ideally I could set it up to Find a certain cell entry and select 11 rows once it locates the next instance of this cell entry, but I think the 13 rows remains as a pattern so if it just counts down 13 rows that should be fine.p  pSo, I think my quandary is how to make the row selections variable.

Negative 93364 pWe are planning to create Google Cardboard experience for Google StreetView.  Google has exposed Google Streetview API to fetch images based on the location and angle. If I use this API, I need to stitch the images based on the User head movement.  User can watch the object in 360 degree horizontally and 180 degree vertically.  How do I implement this based on the StreetView API and How often I need to make the request and what is the best way to combine the images. Is there is any way we can use the com.google.android.gms.maps.StreetViewPanoramaView directly inside the com.google.vrtoolkit.cardboard.CardboardView .. Thanks in Advance.. p

Negative 93364 pIm currently working on a project that will need to display editable tables of arbitrary dimensions.  Im using AngularJS, but as the tables can get very large I expect things will get slow if I dont use some form of bindonce.  The problem is, as far as I can tell, bindonce is absolute  I want it to actually keep or at least reinstate all the watchers for rows currently being edited.p  pHeres the basic idea of how Im currently doing this.p  precodelttr ngrepeatrow in rows track by key hackoncegt   lttd ngrepeatcol in colsgt     ltdiv ngclickeditStuffgtcontents  directivehackonce, function etc   link functionscope, elem, attrs      if scope.row.editing        setTimeoutfunction scope.destroy , 0    codepre  pIm generating a string key on the row from its various identifiers.  When the item is flagged for editing, the controller switches it out for a copy and changes its key to include what will eventually be transaction lock data.  This triggers a replacement in the ngrepeat, and the next time the tr is constructed with the replaced row data, the scope is left intact and updates as you edit stuff.p  pSomehow, it actually works so far anyway.  It drops me from over 500 watchers on a small list to under 100, and what remains is mostly toplevel controls, so I hope it will scale well.  It also seems to retain and properly clean up ngclick listeners and such even though the scope is gone.p  pHowever, its the sort of hack that I cringed just typing it out in brief, and I get the feeling it may induce vomiting in sane people who know this library better than I do.  I was wondering if there was a cleaner andor safer way to do the same thing.  What Im looking for is a better way to emconditionallyem bind once, or have an elementscope otherwise skip its digest for itself and all its children based on some exposed flag.p  pIs there any way to do this that doesnt involve taking a meat cleaver to  the scope or manually reattaching all the jQuery garbage I was hoping to avoid with Angularp

Negative 93364 pI work in a big organization, spread around the world, about 17,000 people. Have to ask for money wayyyyyy in advance for projects before even really knowing what they are.p  pSo were redesigning an old intranet. Spending a chunk of money we have on user research and UX design phase. More on the 1.0 and piloting it and dealing with content migration and all that fun stuff.p  pAny ideas insane ballpark here about how much  to ask for the next phase rolling it out, more testing, actually replacing the legacy intranet I know details are sparse but there are some silly budget deadlines that require me to pull a figure out of thin air before I even really know what our end users want. If I dont come up with a number, we get nothing and have to hunt around in various budgets to get cash.p  pWhat would you throw out for low  medium  high numbers here Low being open source, out of the box functionality, not insane customization, no more UX research beyond what were already doing, and off we go. Medium being a nicer step up, and high being paying someone like Igloo 400k to use their out of the box platform, and then another bunch of custom plugin development and design work on top of that.p  pRight now Im thinking 250k, 500k, 750k. Am I in the right ballpark, or am I over in some other arena thats not even in the same league and hasnt seen a baseball game in yearsp

Negative 93364 pI have a single page application using AngularJS and I am facing one performance issue in it. My application processes incoming events from the server side which are passed to the AngularJS framework on the client side using ASP.NET SignalR. There are millions of events that can be received by my application and there is no performance issue on the server side and it easily passes these number of events one after the other to the AngularJS framework. The problem lies on the client side. After processing the event, i use scope.apply to update the page and display the events. In such a case where there are multiple events being received one after the other, calling scope.apply every time slows down the application and does not show the events quickly. The events will be passed at random so I dont even know how any events will be received by my application at any point in time.p  pAny ideas on how to get this issue resolved will be very helpful.p  pThanks. p

Negative 93364 pI am trying to create my first Android app. I would like a mainthread Activity in my case an ActionBarActivity to receive notification of an event from a background Activity in my case an IntentService. Ive read that using broadcasts should be the best way to do this.p  pTo register a Broadcast Receiver for listening to broadcasts sent from the background activity, I am using the following code inside the mainthread activityp  precode Register broadcast receiver LocalBroadcastManager bManager  LocalBroadcastManager.getInstancethis IntentFilter intentFilter  new IntentFilter intentFilter.addActioncom.me.myBroadcast bManager.registerReceiverbReceiver, intentFilter codepre  pI tried putting this in the onCreate method of my mainthread activity, but I quickly discovered that every time I restart the activity e.g. closing the app and reopening it, it seems to create duplicate broadcast receivers, which then trigger the Broadcast Receivers onReceive method multiple times whenever a single broadcast is sent. This is causing problems.p  pSo I created a SharedPreferences file to save a boolean which remembers whether or not I have already created a Broadcast Receiver, so as to avoid creating duplicates. This works exactly as hoped, until I restart the device of course, after which the Broadcast Receiver is destroyed, and the app doesnt create a new one because the SharedPreferences boolean says it already has one.p  pIm guessing I could patch this issue by setting up a new broadcast receiver to listen for a device reboot, which resets the SharedPreferences boolean, but I have this nagging feeling that I am overcomplicating things massively. What am I missing Thanks for any help offeredp

Negative 93364 pMost view frustums are 35 to 45 degrees, the angle of each of the four sides as they slope from the near plane to far plane. These are exterior angles. A 36 degree frustum has interior angles of 144 degrees. The projection transform generates a box, rather than a frustum. The sides with 144 degree interior angles swivel in to 90 degrees.p  pNow consider that a 10sided prism, a decagon prism, has the same angles as the frustum. If the viewer sees one of its faces orthogonally, as a flat 2D surface, its neighboring faces will virtually disappear after the projection transform, reduced to 90 degree angles. p  pAm I correct or wrong  p

Negative 93364 pNot sure if my main question is clear. Here is the problem I have a page with links to certain pages on a site that have password protection. They load into a frame on my own site. Since today, they detect when a page is being linked to, either in my site or even in a new chrome or firefox tab when you get to it via a link, it redirects you to a different page. I noticed I can still access the page if I enter or copypaste the URL directly into a new tab, or if I open the page in a new incognito window in Chrome. I think they use  javascript to detect it.p  pSo I wonder can I do something so that when I click the link from a page, they detect it NOT as a link but as a manually entered URL Ive been looking through many answers about referrers etc, but I cant find what Im looking for.p  pAnother possibility I looked for is an addon or script to stop a site from redirecting, but it didnt work.p  pThanks, Peterp

Negative 93364 pI have visited a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18835835jprogressbarnotupdatingthisa and  and several other pages like this on this forum and went through Swing on Oracle docs. All of their code doesnt work for my ProgressBar, even if I emulate all their codes line by line and with a few adjustment in my code. I dont know why it is not working I am really feeling PITY on myself that I cant make it work. p  ol lipI know that there is some issue with EDT, but, I on myself cant figure it out. I think my code is working on Worker Threads for updating the progress bar.pli lipAlso, once when the code downloads, then again if I reset the fields and the selected items, then the subsequent calls to download are also blocked. The file is created,but not downloaded. Their size remains 0. Please explain whypli ol  pI created a SwingWorker instance and called updation of FileProgressBar from the doInBackground method, and then calling done. But, it didnt work.

Negative 93364 pOK so I get the idea of the bias node. It moves the transfer function curve horizontally to make it better fit the data. The problem I see is that the bias node weight value is computed just like any other weights. Is this right Should the bias weight be computed in some other manner And also shouldnt there be another bias value to move the transfer function up and down Like this fx1x2...b1b2. I have no idea on how you would compute b2. Any Ideasp

Negative 93364 pI have some data stored in Excel tablescode.xlsxcode, which my current Python script reads them into the memory and uses them for calculations. I will explain my script more with an example.p  pSay my excel file has this data under a specific column codea  [1,2,3,4,5]code.p  pI am reading this whole thing into the memory using pandas codepd.readexcelcode and running my own iterator function to getp  precodea0  [1,2,3,4,5] a1  [5,1,2,3,4] a2  [4,5,1,2,3] codepre  pand so on. Basically I am shifting every element by some integer amount. codea0, a1code and codea2code here appear as lists but they are iterator objects, I dont store them.p  pAs you notice here, codea0code is always the same as codeacode, and I dont really need to store codeacode in memory because I only need it once, which is what codea0code does. So what I am trying to do is having some sort of iterator object to iterate over the excel file directly to capture codea0, a1code and codea2code as if I were importing codeacode first and then iterating for codea0, a1, a2code over codeacode.p  pThe reason I am trying to do such a thing is because, the time my script takes for calculations are shorter than what it takes to import the data from Excel. So in order to increase my script in performance, I need to find a way to iterate over Excel rather than saving data into the memory. I would appreciate any help with this.p  pAddition, my comment If codepandascode or some other library had codereadThisCellcode kind of functionality, it would make things easy for me to make my own excel iterator. But I dont know what my options are with pandas or any other library.p

If I have multiple users connected to the web application at the same time or with multiple tabs things can turn bad. p  pAny suggestion about how to avoid this kind of problemp  pI was thinking about using some thing such as a hrefhttpzeromq.org relnofollowZMQa together with a hrefhttpsgithub.comsocketiosocket.ioclient relnofollowSockets.io in the client sidea, but as the data Im requesting doesnt get fired from any user action, I dont see how this could be triggered from the server side. p

Negative 93364 pEdited at the suggestion or respondersp  pHave also split into a number of different threadsp  pI primarily develop in Access with VBA and some experience of VB some time ago. One of my current projects involves a very dynamic form where users can move and resize a variety of controls primarily lines, ovals and rectangles for room layouts. However in Access this can result in a lot of screen flicker whilst this process is going on, so I decided to look at using vb.net and WPF as an alternative  it also meant I could develop in parallel and learn more about the differences between the two products. p  pIdeally Im hoping someone can point me in the direction of a resource which details the differences between equivalent Access and WPF forms and controls.p  pA case in point is Ive hit a stumbling block with combo boxes. p  pA standard Access functionality is type ahead in comboboxes  Is this functionality available in WPF comboboxes If so, how do I implement itp  pAnother standard Access functionality is being able to show multiple columns on the dropdown  How would I do this in WPF p

Negative 93364 pI have a service that lives in a quite restricted server system. It must run under a specific user, lets call it user A.p  pThe service must also be able to access a network share which user A does not have access to, but user B has.
