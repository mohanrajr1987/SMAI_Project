Positive 357 pI was wondering if theres a way to generate a new SSL certificate for XAMPP.

If Im saying things that makes no sense, please dont hate on me as Ive never worked with SSL certificates before.p  pAlso, I cannot suppress the warnings as I use firebug and the warnings just makes my POST files harder to find.p

Negative 357 pWe have a solution with two different projects, one with the requirement that it be done using the .Net 2.0 framework. The other uses .Net 3.5, and we follow MVVM, though I suspect this is less about MVVM than good patterns.p  pThe .Net 2.0 has several different objects lets say of type Fruit which could potentially require a different WPF user interface to edit the class property values. For now, I am just working on the first one. The .net 3.5 project is what users actually run and edit with.p  pMy first thought was, when we create the Fruit subclass Apple, in the constructor have a Func parameter which returns the call to create the editing dialog. The other fruits, which do not have editing dialogs implemented yet, would simply have a Func parameter which returns a Editing not supported editor dialog. But Funcs are not supported in 2.0. p  pMy next thought is, to add attributes to the .net 2.0 classes which refer to the .Net 3.5 classes which the .net 3.5 project could then create instances of, using reflection. But this seems messy. p  pI could create a CreateFruitEditor class in the .net 3.5 project that just checks the Fruit type and creates the appropriate editor window, but that would eventually result in a big multiline if statement checking types with the assumption that the fruits are quite different in editing.p  pSo...the .net 2.0 project classes must somehow inform my .net 3.5 project of what .net 3.5 classes to use for editing the .net 2.0 classes.p

But practice dictates that developer should use either codeNSBinaryStoreTypecode, codeNSInMemoryStoreTypecode or codeNSSQLiteStoreTypecode store types in release builds.p  pHow do you manage changes between debug and release builds I believe that changing store type from codeNSXMLTypeStorecode to, say, codeNSBinaryStoreTypecode in code on each release is kinda cumbersome.p
Negative 357 pIve been having trouble with a php and JavaScript upload script accepting large file uploads with Dreamhost. I realize that you are supposed to edit php.ini to change post max size and the memory limit, but it isnt behaving as it should.p  pThe only way I have ever successfully had a large file upload was switching to Dreamhost PS and making the memory limit as high as a file 1GB but there has to be another cost effective way, otherwise how oils sites like YouTube survive I get IO errors if I do not have all this memory available. p  pCould anyone help Ive struggled with this for over a month.p

Negative 357 pemI think that perhaps the original question was too longwinded with too many unnecessary details, so this is my attempt to simplify.emp  pI am looking for a means to perform emanyem of the actions below.  I only need to do one, not all.  If anyone knows the answer to even one of these, please respond.  So, is it possible to do any of the following in Linq to SQLp  ul lipPull entities out of a codeDataContextcode via codeExecuteQuerycode or codeExecuteMethodCallcode without having those entities trackedpli lipInvoke codeExecuteQuerycode or codeExecuteMethodCallcode and guarantee that I always receive fresh copies of the results retrieved from the database, even if those entities had already been retrieved and are already in the identity cachepli lipInstruct Linq to SQL not to perform any change tracking whatsoever on specific entity types  but still allow change tracking for other typespli ul  pstrongRestrictionsstrongp  ul lipThe codeRefreshcode method is out of the question the number of entities is quite large and this would become a performance disaster.pli lipI cannot simply set codeObjectTrackingEnabledcode to codefalsecode, because the codeDataContextcode does not allow setting it back to codetruecode after a query has been executed, and I do need emsomeem of the entities to be tracked.pli lipI also cannot throw away the original codeDataContextcode and use a new one I need to be able to do this in the middle of a transaction.pli ul  hr  pThis is starting to become a serious problem, and I really think that the default behaviour is illconceived.  If I execute an adhoc query or stored procedure, I expect the results I receive to be the exact results that were returned by said query.  It only makes sense if I wanted the old, stale entities, why would I go back to the database to get themp  pAt the moment, my workaround is to either a create a new codeDataContextcode specially for the query and override the transaction isolation level, or b make the return type a DTO that is identical to the entity in every way but without the code[Table]code attribute, and map it to the original entity using AutoMapper.  Both of these seem like horrible hacks.p  pWould really appreciate any suggestions anyone has on this conundrum.p

Negative 357 pI have problem concerning python packages and testing. Im writing an application using emwx pythonem and have the following basic folderpackage structure for the gui parts.

That is, for the logpane, Id like to have small runnable example that will lauch a bare bone application showing the view to test that layout is ok etc. The way I started out was that I had a p  precodeif name  main      create some small window and a wx app      instanciate the panel and launch the app     pass codepre  pin the actual implementation file of the panelview itself. This worked wonders for the logpane. I could just run the file standalone to have a look at the view and see that it held together.p  pBut of course the strategy broke down for the emmainframe.pyem since the dependency to emlogpane.pyem couldnt be resolved. This since the current main module emisem the mainframe.py and the only way mainframe.py can reach the utilviews package is if the mainlaunched module is further up in the tree.p  pSo how do I structure these types of tests For unit tests I use emnoseem which is nice and takes care of the problem since nose is launched per the mainapp folder so all intrapackage references works. But these tests are like small standalone programs. I simply cant clutter the mainapp folder with these python files there will be many such files. Are there any other way I can accomplish thisp  pAny input is valuable.p  pThanks, Rickardp

Negative 357 pIve been tasked with creating a Composite that contains two TableViewers.  The top table contains a single row of editable cells.  These table cells will be used to filter data in the bottom table. There are a number of things that are not working properly, but Ill limit my inquiry, here, to one in particular.

If I install them with our company standard software image, they became 4x to 5x slower on the same VS project.p  pThe same company software image on Lenovo laptops Corei5 or desktops Corei7 shows no measurable difference between the company image and the factory preinstalled Win7. Its even stranger If I install VirtualBox with a Win7 image on a HP system with the problem the virtual machine DOESNT have the problem.p  pEvery benchmark tool I have tried shows no measurable difference between the company image and the preinstalled Win7. Only msbuild is affected and only on the HP machines running Win7 on the company image.p  pBefore you ask I have disabled all softwarebackground processes in the company image, but that doesnt make any difference. Its obviously not something running in the background that somehow interacts with msbuild. My best guess is that on the HP hardware some settings gets changed that affects msbuild. This doesnt happen on other hardware. And the VS2010 GUI is not usedexecuted at all. I am aware this can interact with the msbuild if both try top access the same solutionfiles. Antivirus doesnt make any difference either. p  pAnybody have any idea what could possible influence msbuild to slow down Any suggestion, no matter how farfetched, is welcome.p

A simple example, counting the number of elements is shown belowp  precodetemplatelttypename T1, typename T2gt void countTupleElements boosttuplesconsltT1, T2gtamp tupleRec, int index, const stdvectorltstdstringgtamp vals       return 1  countTupleElements tupleRec.tail    templatelttypename Tgt void countTupleElements boosttuplesconsltT, boosttuplesnulltypegtamp tupleRec, int index, const stdvectorltstdstringgtamp vals       return 1  codepre  pCrucially this pattern is often used in circumstances where you want to do something different for each of the various tuple element types not illustrated in my example in C compiletime recursion is essential as once code is running, the type information is lost for all useful purposes.p  pMy question is, is something similar possible with a Scala HList, e.g.p  precodeval example  1  2.0  Hello  World  HNil codepre  pIm aware that Scala, running on the JVM, has reflection  and so presumably this could be implemented using runtime recursion with a function using manifests and pattern matching. But Im interested in knowing if its possible to do something similar to the C example, using compiletime recursion p

Negative 357 pIve been running into quite a few database problems lately. My current situation is that a record is not created with the the value I tell it to. It creates 00 instead of 100.

However, I have not looked at the database on the phone, because eclipse does not open the data folder for some reason. I only discovered this when i decided to pull the database from emulatorbecause of other sqlite issues that i am having please look at my other questions if you are proficient in this area .

Negative 357 pINTRODUCTION Im a bioinformatician. In my analysis which I perform on all human genes about 20 000 I search for a particular short sequence motif to check how many times this motif occurs in each gene. p  pGenes are written in a linear sequence in four letters A,T,G,C. For example CGTAGGGGGTTTAC... This is the fourletter alphabet of genetic code which is like the secret language of each cell, its how DNA actually stores information.p  pI suspect that frequent repetations of a particular short motif sequence AGTGGAC in some genes are crucial in a specific biochemical process in the cell. Since the motif itself is very short it is difficult with computational tools to distinguish between true functional examples in genes and those that look similar by chance. To avoid this problem I get sequences of all genes and concatenated into a single string and shuffled. The length of each of the original genes was stored. Then for each of the original sequence lengths, a random sequence was constructed by repeatedly picking A or T or G or C at random from the concatenated sequence and transferring it to the random sequence. In this way, the resulting set of randomized sequences has the same length distribution, as well as the overall A,T,G,C composition. Then I search for the motif in these randomized sequences. I permormed this procedure 1000 times and averaged the results.p  p15000 genes that do not contain a given motif 5000 genes that contain 1 motif 3000 genes that contain 2 motifs 1000 genes that contain 3 motifs ... 1 gene that contain 6 motifsp  pSo even after 1000 times randomization of true genetic code, there arent any genes which have more than 6 motifs. But in the true genetic code, there are a few genes which contain more then 20 occurrences of the motif, which suggest that these repetition might be functional and its unlikely to find them in such an abundance by pure chance.p  pPROBLEM I would like to know the probability of finding a gene with lets say 20 occurences of the motif in my distribution. So I want to know the probability to find such a gene by chance. I would like to implement this in Python, but I dont know how.p  pCan I do such an analysis in Pythonp  pAny help would be appreciated. p

Negative 357 pok not as simple as title may make it sound. I tried this in a very primal way with c and it worked, but I have a feeling a better job could be achieved with Java and Oracle as database. So the thing isp  pI have a reservation system. multiple bookings could be made on the same day for period between date X and date Y as long as each day in the range can accommodate the requested number. Maximum number of clusters to reserve is 46. Hence logically you would look at each day as a holder of 46 cluster reservation and deduce from that. p  pNow what I have difficulty working out isp  pwhen there are n number of bookings stored and valid in database, then I want to make new booking. So how do I check if this new date range falls within any of the previously booked days or not. Not talking simply here about x falling in y as ranges. More likep  precode   XY        Xy   XY                          XY codepre  pas u can see the overlap is happening.p  pPlease let me know how could I do this as it will affect early design of objects Regardsp
Negative 357 pI have an AutoCompleteBox binded to an ObservableCollection ItemsSource which I filter on my own by querying entities from a domainservice. I used the scenario of populating from a webservice call from the blog of Jeff Wilcox, by setting the PopulatingEventArgs.Cancel to True, and when my collection is ready, I call PopulateComplete on the ACB.p  pMy goal is to reopen the dropdown on mouseover or click but without reloading again all the data from the web. I found a question on stackoverflow where the answer was to set IsDropDownOpen to True. But in this case, the ACB population starts again, and another call goes to the webservice.p  pOf course, when the user starts typing, the filtering should be done again. for ex. you type ric and the box suggests rice and ricin, you select rice, but you change your mind and want to select another one from the same collection, lets say ricin. In this case you already have the suggestions containing ric in memory, no need to load them again..p  pI found an alternative way in which instead of setting IsDropDownOpen, I just simply call the PopulateComplete method. This does exactly the same thing that I want, but with a little fail after my ACB loses focus, the dropdown is not opened again on mouseover liek it should. Even when I click back into the acb textbox.p  pSo is there a fix for this, or does someone know why the PopulateComplete only reopens the dropdown when the ACB has focus for the first time Or this was only my luck that calling this method reopened the dropdown and the IsDropDownOpen property should be used instead afaik this would be only possible with some flags indicating that its a fake populating event triggered by my mouseover and after PopulatingEventArgs.Cancel i should call immediately PopulateComplete. but i dont get it, if this may work havent tried yet, why not when calling simply the PopulateCompletep

Negative 357 pWe have been running our Java code on windows servers for years. We want to run the same code on some FreeBSD boxes but our code has grown up in an environment where filepath name are case insensitive for so long that a lot of the code will break.p  pWhat I want to do is some sort of trick where we subclass File or FileSystem or some similar trick and this forces all our file names to lower case all the time.p  pIt seems pretty possible i.e. extend File with a new class OurFile that forces everything lower case.  Then we would run a script that turns all filesfolders on the OS lower case and bam, bugs squashed.p  pIt seems like some similar hacking with a new FileSystem implementation would also yield a good result.p  pI then thought  surely someone before me has faced this issue and licked it good.  p  pSo, what is the wisdom out there  Is there an easystandard way to fix this sort of case sensitivity problem i.e. has someone written LowerCaseFileSystemForPortingWindowsToUnix extends FileSystem, and tested it etc.p

Negative 357 pBefore I go on, this is purely a question of intuition.  That is, Im not seeking answers to work out specific bugs in my PHPMySQL code.  Rather, I want to understand what the range of possible issues that I need to consider in resolving my issue.  To these ends, I will not post code or attach scripts  I will simply explain what I did and what is happening.p  pI have written PHP script thatp  ol liReads a CSV text file of X records to be inserted into a MySQL database table strongandor update duplicatestrong entries where applicableli liInserts said records into what I will call a root table for that data setli liSelects subset records of specific fields from the root table and then inserts those records into a master table andli liCreates an output export text file from the master table for distribution.li ol  pThere are several CSV files that I am processing via separate scheduled cron tasks every 30 minutes.  All said, from the various sources, there are an estimated 420,000 insert transactions from file to root table, and another 420,000 insert transactions from root table to master table via the scheduled tasks.p  pOne of the tasks involves a CSV file of about 400,000 records by itself.  The processing contains no errors, but heres the problem  of the 400,000 records that MySQL indicates have been successfully inserted into the root table, only about 92,000 of those records actually store in the root table  Im losing about 308,000 records from that scheduled task.p  pThe other scheduled tasks process about 16,000 and 1,000 transactions respectively, and these transactions process perfectly.  In fact, if I reduce the number of transactions from 400,000 to, say, 10,000, then these process just fine as well.  Clearly, thats not the goal here.p  pTo address this issue, I have tried several remedies...p  ol liUpping the memory of my server and increasing the max limit in the php.ini fileli liGetting a dedicated database with expanded memory as opposed to a shared VPS databaseli liRewriting my code to substantially eliminate stored arrays that suck down memory and process fgetcsv processes on the runli liUse INSERT DELAYED MySQL statements as opposed to plain INSERT statementsli ol  p...and none of these remedies have worked as desired.p  pWhat range of remedial actions should be considered at this point, given the lack of success in the actions taken so far  Thanks...p

Only option 3 works but this is not really what I need because I do not want the service in my main application class but in my JavaFX controllers instead. With option 3 I would have to pass the initialized service to my controller classes somehow and in this case I do not need Weld. So how do I inject service beans into JavaFX controllers Unfortunately I found no documentation about my issue.p  pMaybe someone has gathered experience using Weld and JavaFX and can help me out.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI wrote down some of my efforts in the a hrefhttpscommunity.jboss.orgmessage732768 relnofollowWeld discussion foruma but I got no answer unfortunately. In my opinion Weld does not work with JavaFX. I think I have to insert my services into my controllers using good old setters see the forum for a solution.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pI found a a hrefhttpblog.matthieu.brouillard.fr201208fxmljavafxpoweredbycdijbossweld6.html relnofollowblog about Weld and JavaFX 2a. I have not tried the solution yet but I think its useful for other programmers.p

Negative 357 pMy goal is to create an IIS Managed Module that looks at the Request and filters out content from the POST XSS attacks, SQL injection, etc.br Im hung up right now, however, on the process of actually filtering the Request.  Heres what Ive got so farp  pIn the Modules Init, I set HttpApplication.BeginRequest to a local event handler.  In that event handler, I have the following lines set upp  precodeif application.Context.Request.HttpMethod  POST              application.Context.Request.Filter  new HttpRequestFilterapplication.Context.Request.Filter      codepre  pI also set up an HttpResponseFilter on the application.Context.Response.Filterp  pHttpRequestFilter and HttpResponseFilter are implementations of Stream.p  pIn the response filter, I have the following set up an override of Stream.Writep  precodepublic override void Writebyte[] buffer, int offset, int count              var Content  UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetStringbuffer         Content  ResponseFilter.FilterContent         responseStream.WriteUTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesContent, offset, UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCountContent      codepre  pResponseFilter.Filter is a simple String.Replace, and it does, in fact, replace text correctly.  p  pIn the request filter, however, there are 2 issues. The code I have currently in the RequestFilter an override of Stream.Readp  precodepublic override int Readbyte[] buffer, int offset, int count      var Content  UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetStringbuffer     Content  RequestFilter.FilterContent     if buffer[0] 0              return requestStream.ReadUTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesContent, offset, UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCountContent          return requestStream.Readbuffer, offset, count  codepre  pThere are 2 issues with this.  First, the filter is called twice, not once, and one of the requests is just basically a stream of 0s.  the if check on buffer[0] filters this currently, but I think that Im setting something up wrongp  pSecond, even though I am correctly grabbing content with the .GetString in the read, and then altering it in RequestFilter.Filtera glorified string.replace, when I return the byte encoded Content inside the if statement, the input is unmodified.  p  pHeres what Im trying to figure outp  p1  Is there something I can check prior to the filter to ensure that what Im checking is only the POST and not the other time it is being called  Am I not setting the Application.Context.Request.Filter up correctlyp  p2  Im really confused as to why rewriting things to the requestStream the HttpApplication.Context.Request.Filter that I sent to the class isnt showing up.  Any input as to something Im doing wrong would be really appreciated.p  pAlso, is there any difference between HttpApplication.Request and HttpApplication.Context.Request  p  pedit for more information, Im testing this on a simple .aspx page that has a text box, a button and a label, and on button click assigns the text box text to the labels text.  Ideally, if I put content in the textbox that should be filtered, it is my understanding that by intercepting and rewriting the post, I can cause the stuff to hit the server as modified.  Ive run test though with breakpoints in the module and in code, and the module completes before the code behind on the .aspx page is hit.  The .aspx page gets the values as passed from the form, and ignores any filtering I attempted to do.  p

Negative 357 pI want to create a browser plugin or extension that I can use to control an Arduino device. The Arduino device would be connected to a users computer through USB. The user would visit a website which the plugin would recognize and download instructions that would be used to control the device locally.p  pThe preference is that the user only needs to install a browser plugin, and not have to install any separate software on their machine.p  pWhat would be a good way to connect the browser to the Arduino device. Id prefer to have a solution that would work on any browser.p  pOne thought was to communicate with the Arduino device using node.js or some other webserver, but that would mean that Id have to install a node.js server along with the browser plugin.

Negative 357 pI am developing an application when i retrieve a data from an sqlite database using rawQuery method because the query is a UNION query  and the data is displayed on a listview . I would like to use a query method because i would also like to implement a content provider to handle the data retrieved from the database. Is there any way someone can implement a union query using the query method.p  pI would only like to know of the structure since the query is already working using the rawQuery method how do i structure it using a query methodp
Negative 357 pin a .net web app is there something special about .aspx pages and the c code behind pages that changes the behaviour of static variables.p  pi have a large number of application pages that were developed elsewhere and there is a common pattern running thru them where what i think should be an instance variable is declared as a static variable.p  pa more detailed statement of the question would be  if i have two web sessions a and b running on the same iis server in the same application pool, if a accesses the page in question and sets static variable x to value1 and then b accesses the same page and sets static variable x to value 2, my understanding is that value1 has been replaced by value 2.  my dilemma is that this pattern is used repeatedly in the code, at a high level the code appears to work.  the conclusion is that it is either luck timing as in session a has abandoned the need for the variable before session b hits it or there is something else going on.p  pi am open to suggestions whether this is a c nuance or a developer bug.p
Negative 357 pI asked a similar question a while ago but I didnt know very much, so I wasnt able to be specific enough.p  pI want to write a program that takes input from my microphone, processes it, and then sends the output to a fake virtual microphone as if the processed sound I created was what a microphone was hearing. I would then like to be able to use this virtual microphone with any application that supports choosing your microphone input pretty much any well written software as a valid microphone. So what the application hears will be my processed version of the microphone input.p  pIm working with Portaudio in C and I can capture from the mic, process, and send out to the speakers just fine. Now I need to replace my real speakers in the application with the phony microphone. Windows seems to have some APIs for this.  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff53620128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff53620128vvs.8529.aspxa So my sink pin will be the real microphone and I will have to create a NEW source pin that should be visible to other applications. How would I go about doing this Im having difficulty finding code samples or really even any very informative documentation.p  pLanguage C OS Windows 7p

Negative 357 pHow can I simulate the functionsactions of a proxy server but without calling elements like HttpListener or TcpListener  How can I generate them from within my C applicationp  pIve been able to get as far as getting actual data streamed back to my WebBrowser element in my C application but upon viewing the results, it gives me errors.

Obviously, my solution thinks theyre local and, as such, cant resolve them.p  pIm missing proxylike functions where it should just hand off the stream back to my mock browser and display properly.

Negative 357 pI am stuck at a place where my Android PhoneSamsung Galaxy has to open 2or more connections to my PCserver which is a paired device. For this purpose, I start SDP server on PC with UUID  0000110100001000800000805F9B34FB and channel 2, after the first connection I unregister the SDP service on the PC and register it again on channel 3and same UUID and expect my android phone to connect to it for establishing the second bluetooth connection. The second one fails.p  pThe problem as I have figured out is that because of the pairing, the channel num and UUID of the device for the BluetoothSocket.connect are serviced from cache and are not being updated, so my SDP change in channel num on the server side is not visible here as it still tries to connect to channel 2old one.p  pA workaround of this problemfound after a lot of frustrating attempts might be to change the android.server.BluetoothService.java file, by introducing  updateDeviceServiceChannelCacheaddr before returning in the getRemoteServiceChannel and fetchRemoteUuids so as to update the channel number at each func call. p  pThe above solution may well be wrong, please pardon me for that. If it is correct please suggest any further changes and how to make this change permanent in eclipse, or in other casewrong solution, the right way of doing this.p  pNote I have android 2.3.5 and the requests from the device are actually from the browser that I forward to the PC. I want them on separate channels.p  pthanks. p

Negative 357 pI have a mediumsized native C application. When I run it from within Visual Studio 2008, it runs roughly 10x slower than when run from outside Visual Studio. This applies to both Debug and Release builds, and happens both when I run the application as codeStart Debuggingcode F5 and codeStart Without Debuggingcode CtrlF5.p  pIn other words Running a Release build in Visual Studio strongwithoutstrong a debugger is 10x slower than running the same executable from a command prompt or from Windows Explorer.p  pThings I triedp  ul liDoublechecking no breakpoints, tracepoint, exception debugging etc. are set. There were none.li lisetting codeNODEBUGHEAP1code in VS Debugging properties for the app. No effect.li liSetting codecmd c set PATHcode to be run by CtrlF5 instead of the app itself and comparing that to the codePATHcode available outside of VS. No difference.li liRunning DependencyWalker on the exe and comparing it with libraries Visual Studio lists as loaded when running the app. No difference.li liGoogling and searching SO, but this only came up with the above ideas or dealt with F5 vs. CtrlF5 differences there are none in my case.li ul  pIve run out of ideas, and I would be grateful for any pointers on where to look or what to try.p  pThe application uses OpenGL an Qt, and does fairly ordinary stuff no loadingunloading DLLs, file input at start only 3D model and shaders, no file output, few 3rd party librairies and apart from Qt, all are linked statically.p  pTo add insult to injury, I only started experiencing this behaviour after a recent internal refactoring of the app. Before that, it ran fine both within and withot VS. This refactoring involved mainly extracting some functionality into a newly created base class that is, changing codeA gt Bcode inheritance into codeA gt C gt Bcode inheritance, very few virtual calls involved and replacing a few codenew[]code calls with codestdvectorcodes.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI tried one more thing In the Debugging properties of the app, setting the target to be codecmd kcode, then doing CtrlF5 to launch the codecmdcode and running the app from that command line. This way, it runs at normal speed i.e. the 10x slowdown is not there. This is useless for debugging, of course, but I wanted to mention it out of a sense of completeness.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pIve found it it was a weird dependency on working directory. If started from the directory where the .vcproj resides which VS normally does with F5 and CtrlF5, a relative path in the directory would exist and a debugging output whose existence I had forgotten succeeded, slowing down the run. Executing from any other directory made the output fail, resulting in faster execution.p  pMy apologies to all who spent their time on this. Voting to close.p

Negative 357 pIm reading the strongperlipc perldocstrong and was confused by the section entitled Interactive Client with IOSocket.  It shows a client program that connects with some server and sends a message, receives a response, sends another message, receives a response, ad infinitum.  The author, Tom Christiansen, states that writing the client as a singleprocess program would be much harder, and proceeds to show an implementation that forks a child process dedicated to reading STDIN and sending to the server, while the parent process reads from the server and writes to STDOUT.p  pI understand how this works, but I dont understand why it wouldnt be much emsimplerem rather than harder to write it as a singleprocess programp  precodewhile 1      read from STDIN     write to server     read from server     write to STDOUT  codepre  pMaybe Im missing the point, but it seems to me this is a bad example.  Would you ever really design an clientserver application protocol where the server might suddenly think of something else to say, interjecting characters onto the terminal where the client is in the middle of typing his next queryp  pstrongUPDATE 1strong I understand that the example empermitsem asynchronicity what Im puzzled about is why concurrent IO between a strongCLIstrong client and a server would ever be emdesirableem due to the jumbling of input and output of text on the terminal.  I cant think of any CLI app  clientserver or not  that does that.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Oh  Duh... my solution only works if theres emexactly oneem line sent from the server for every line sent by the client.  If the server can send an unknown number of lines in response, Id have to sit in a read from server loop  which would never end, unless my protocol defined some special end of response token.  By handling the sending and receiving in separate processes, you leave it up to the user at the terminal to detect end of response.  p  pI wonder whether its the client, or the server, that typically generates a command prompt  Id always assumed it was the client, but now Im thinking it makes more sense for it to be the server.  p

Heres the codep  precodepublic class EditedLine  UserControl      public delegate void LineClickEventHandlerobject sender, EditedLineClickEventArgs e      [DescriptionOccurs when control is clicked]     public event LineClickEventHandler MyClick      private Color color     private float size      public EditedLine              color  Color.Black         size  3          public EditedLineColor color, float size              color  color         size  size           public Color LineColor              get  return color          set  color  value           public float LineSize              get  return size          set  size  value            protected override void OnPaintPaintEventArgs e              base.OnPainte         e.Graphics.DrawLinenew Pencolor, size, new Point0, 0, new Pointthis.Size.Width, 0          protected override void OnClickEventArgs e              base.OnClicke         OnLineClicknew EditedLineClickEventArgs           protected virtual void OnLineClickEditedLineClickEventArgs e              if MyClick  null                      MyClickthis, e                codepre  pp  pluckly everythings is working. I can see my control in the control toolbox and I can add to my project, even the event is working. But, if inside MyClick i try to change the color of the Line, nothing happens. I have to use this Proprieties intead of the ones beforep  precode    public Color LineColor              get  return color          set  color  value this.Refresh            public float LineSize              get  return size          set  size  value this.Refresh        codepre  pSo Im asking myself if there is a better way to refresh the control. If Im redrawing a single line is easy to be done, but if it is a more complex control I thought to do a Redraw private method but I dont know how to access the Graphic object of the EditedLine istance. Is INotifyPropertyChanged useful But the Graphic still remains my biggest problemp

Negative 357 pThis is a bit of a tricky problem to explain but I will try my best.p  pI have a calendar of events. In these there are nonworking days. When any part of an event lands in on on a nonworking day, its days are extended until it reaches a working day. See herep  pI have an orange 1 day event. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commUNJb.png altenter image description herep  pWhen it is dragged to the nonworking day, it extendsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRG7s3.png altenter image description herep  pThis works great and works fine.  Here is the problem. I only show 2 weeks of the calendar at a time.  Therefore, first, I fetch the visible events that start, end or fall in the range.  Then, I fetch the nonworking days for the range and dynamically add the nonworking days to its length.p  pHere is where the problem isp  pSay there is an event that starts Jan 28th and ends Jan 29th. This means it will not get fetched. But because of NonWorking Days, it would end up on Feb 6th lets say. Well because I did not fetch it in my first step, I will not see it from feb 4 to 15.  That is essentially my problem.p  pThe naive solution would be to grab all events and all nonworking days and then precalculate all end days dynamically, then filter the visible ones there. But that will get very expensive very fast.p  pBut I cannot think of any other solution. It needs to be dynamic.  Does anyone have any creative ideas on how I could solve this in a non ON2 manner.  Just a general outline of a solution would be very helpful. I do not mind modifying the db if needed.p  pCurrently a schedule has a start date and Hours. I dynamically calculate an events length because different employees work different hours which is why I cannot have static end dates.p

Negative 357 pIm developing a simple 2D board game using hexagonal tile maps, Ive read several articles including the gamedev ones, which are linked every time theres a question on hexagonal tiles on how to draw hexes on the screen and how to manage the movement though much of it I had already done before. My main problem is finding the adjacent tiles based on a given radius.p  pThis is how my map system worksp  precode0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4        1,0 1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4    2,0 2,1 2,2 2,3 2,4      3,0 3,1 3,2 3,3 3,4 etc... codepre  pWhat Im struggling with is the fact that I cant just select the adjacent tiles by using codeforxrangexrangex foryrangeyrangeycode because it selects unwanted tiles in the example I gave, selecting the 1,1 tile and giving a range of 1 would also give me the 3,0 tile the ones I actually need being 0,10,21,01,22,12,2 , which is kinda adjacent to the tile because of the way the array is structured but its not really what I want to select. I could just brute force it, but that wouldnt be beautiful and would probably not cover every aspect of selecting radius thing.p  pCan someone point me in the right direction herep
Negative 357 pI on my website I currently have several forms on different pages. Each of which calls a js validation method when they are submitted. They are also validated server side, I just do it in js as well to prevent unnecessary page refreshes. This validation method varies from page to page. For example for the register page it checks if the user already exists, if all fields are filled in and if the passwords match. On the contact page it only checks if the 2 emails match. Now to me it seems stupid to have each of these validation methods separate, as several of the checks they do are done elsewhere. Is there some kind of way in which I could abstract thisp

Negative 357 pIm having some trouble using multidimensional arrays for a program. Essentially, the program uses scanf to read a user ID and a string of chars from a redirected file. the file format is a three digit user ID, a space, and a string of chars representing the answers to multiple choice problems on a test on each line, eg.p  precode111 dabac 102 dcbdc 251 dbbac codepre  pThe problem Im running into is that I dont know how many users there are, and I cant read the file data multiple times. Ive tried using p  precodefor lineNumber  0 lineNumber  1 lineNumber  int result  scanfd , ampdata if result  EOF   break fori  0 i lt numProblems i    scanfc, ampinput  codepre  pto get the number of lines in the file, then set the size of the array. The array is then passed to another function that reads the data, using the same for loop but with p  precodeinput  arrayName[numProblems][lineNumber] codepre  pin the second for loop. The issue Im running into is that scanf can only read the data from the file once, and I cant store the data in the array until I initialize it, which requires me to know how many users there are. p  pThe way I have it set up, the program can strongeitherstrong find the number of linesusers or store the data in the array if I set the size to an arbitrary number, but not both.p  pI have to use scanf because the filename isnt constant and also this is for a class... the professor requires scanf to be used, and I cant figure out how to get the number of lines in the file and still be able to read the data. If anyone knows of a workaround to either find the number of lines without using scanf, or to read the data twice, I would really appreciate some help. If it would help to post the entire program, I can do that as well.p  pThank you,p  pErikp

Negative 357 pstrongShort questionstrong is there a PMML interface for Java, Python or any other major programming language that supports SVM modelsp  pstrongBackgroundstrong I have trained an SVM model in R using the codeksvmcode function from the codekernlabcode package.

Has anyone run into this issue before or know what the 0 error code meansp  pHere are some examples of YouTube IDs that give error code 0p  peDdI7GhZSQA S09F5MejfBE QUwxKWT6m7U TAbnQZZ6QXcp  pThanks.p
Negative 357 pI have this url domainsearchresultsp  pI would like add filters to the URL but without using Javascript everytime the user click a filter, so the url grows like domainsearchresultsfilterfilter...p  pI can solve this by adding the filter via javascript to the action method, but I want to avoid this solution if possible.p  pI cant use redirect because it will cause the page to load twice once for domainsearchresults and another one domainsearchresultsfilterp  pThanks.p
Negative 357 pIve got a table Events with a linked table Registrations, and I want to create an OData service that returns records from the Events table, plus the number of registrations for each event. The data will be consumed clientside in JavaScript, so I want to keep the size of the returned data down and not include all linked registration records completely.p  pFor examplep  precodeID  Title      Date            Regs 1   Breakfast  01.01.01 1200  4 2   Party      01.01.01 2000  20 codepre  pIm building the service with ASP.NET MVC4. The tables are in an MSSQL database. I am really just getting started with OData and LINQ.p  pI tried using the WebAPI OData system first using classes of EntitySetController but was getting cryptic server errors as soon as I included the Registrations table in the entity set. The complex type Models.Registration refers to the entity type Models.Event through the property Event.p  pI had more success building a WCF OData system, and can request event information and information on related registrations.p  pHowever, I have no clue how to include the aggregate count information in the event result set. Do I need to create a custom entity set that will be the source for the OData service I probably included too litte information here for finding a solution, but I dont really know where to look. Can somebody help mep

Negative 357 pIm in a process of converting my RDBMSoracle to ravenBD. Today we have 2 main tables 1. metadata 2 entites.

The Metadata table has a mapping of each column to the meaningwhen TypeId  1  String1  Name, when TypeId  2, String1  Description.br Its a basicly a generic db, so in our server the is only 1 main object  Entity, which describs all of our entities. Nowadays as we get larger and lager we need to suport more type of entities which have a vaster number of columns, more that we can support with that design.and we hate to do alter table. NoSql is classic for that need. Now Im tring to come up with the best practice with raven for that problem...p  pI would realy appreciate some designs...p  pRazp

Negative 357 pId like to have a compareTo method that takes a Real a class for working with arbitrarily large and precise real numbers [well, as long as its less than 231 in length at the moment] and a compareTo method that takes an Object, but Java isnt letting me and Im not experienced enough to know why.p  pI just tried to modify the class to implement Comparable and I got these error messages below. I dont really understand what the error messages mean but I know its got something to do with the horrible way Im trying to give the class some flexibility with all the different method signatures for every single method I make, and I can fix it by removing the compareToObject other method, but I would ideally like to keep it. So what Im really asking is Is there a way to make these error messages disappear without removing the compareToObject other method and what exactly do these errors meanp  pAlso, I know there are already some builtin Java classes like BigInteger and things like that for what Im trying to use this class for but Im doing it for funsatisfaction for use with Project Euler a hrefhttpsprojecteuler.nethttpsprojecteuler.neta.p  precodeJakeJakePC cygdrivecUsersJakeDocumentsJavaMathematics  javac Real.java Real.java377 error name clash compareToReal in Real overrides a method whose erasure is the same as another method, yet neither overrides the other   public int compareToReal other                 first method  compareToObject in Real   second method compareToT in Comparable   where T is a typevariable     T extends Object declared in interface Comparable Real.java440 error name clash compareToObject in Real and compareToT in Comparable have the same erasure, yet neither overrides the other   public int compareToObject other                 where T is a typevariable     T extends Object declared in interface Comparable 2 errors codepre  pThese are the compareTo methodsp  precode  Override   public int compareToReal other         Logic.      public int compareTochar givenValue     return compareTonew RealgivenValue    public int compareTochar[] givenValue     return compareTonew RealgivenValue    public int compareTochar[] givenValue, int offset, int count     return compareTonew RealgivenValue, offset, count    public int compareTodouble givenValue     return compareTonew RealgivenValue    public int compareTofloat givenValue     return compareTonew RealgivenValue    public int compareToint givenValue     return compareTonew RealgivenValue    public int compareTolong givenValue     return compareTonew RealgivenValue    public int compareToObject other     return compareTonew Realother.toString  codepre  pand the constructors just in case you need themp  precode  public RealString givenValue         Logic.      public Realchar givenValue     thisString.valueOfgivenValue    public Realchar[] givenValue     thisString.valueOfgivenValue    public Realchar[] givenValue, int offset, int count     thisString.valueOfgivenValue, offset, count    public Realdouble givenValue     thisString.valueOfgivenValue    public Realfloat givenValue     thisString.valueOfgivenValue    public Realint givenValue     thisString.valueOfgivenValue    public Reallong givenValue     thisString.valueOfgivenValue    public RealObject other     thisother.toString  codepre

ESP since I want to try and see what gestures work best and compare having a low number of gestures vs high and compare combos IE having both box and rectangle confuses the system, while having just one of each mixed in with others works well enough and their effectiveness when comparing their prediction score.p  pOn other note, if anyone know of some good gestures that limits both false positive and false negative, that would be appreciated to get me started more on this research that is going slow due to how hard it is to reset and select gestures to compare with. p  pThanks.p

Negative 357 pI have 2 versions of perl5.18.1 installed.p  pOne was built with the alias perlt threaded, the other built as perl5.18.1 then aliased to perlp plain, not threaded.

Negative 357 pI want to use Logging in a project which currently does not have any logging implementation. I was planning to use NLog but stumbled upon an answer here that said ReflectInsight is an even more powerful logging solution so I would like to give it a try.

Negative 357 pI just want to get your opinions on the following scenario I need to develop multiple web sites that use a single signon service. If the user hits the site and he hasnt been authenticated, he needs to be asked for credentials and afterwards should be allowed to use any of the sites for a certain amount of time. Each user will have a set of roles that can be defined for each of the sites and should be strictly enforced.br Is codeOAuthcode the best way to go or are there other good options that you know ofbr Is it worth the effort to just develop my own servicep  pI forgot to mention that we do not want to use Google, Facebook, Twitter etc as OAuth providers, so if we go for OAuth we have to make our own provider.p

Negative 357 pOk I want to build a report that includes several sub reports, all of the sub reports will be basically the same thing but the control source will change and one label will change. What I want to be able to do is use access VBA to duplicate the one report change the name of the new report and change the control source and label. Now I also want to use VBA to Put certain sub reports into the main report, so lets say I build it with all sub reports, but in a user form a person wants to omit data, then the VBA code would essentially delete certain sub reports or insert certain sub reports to the main report, the dimensions for all sub reports would be the same.

Negative 357 pI have looked around and couldnt find a complete answer to the following.p  pI am planning to build an iOS application which will handle UserData and provide SeedData via the initial bundle. There was already a useful a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10224016coredatawithmultiplestoresconfigurationwoesposta as how to use jointly two databases living in two different persistent stores. In my case, it responds to only to part of the problem.p  pI want to be able to provide various sets of SeedData as to allow storage space management as the dataset are rather big with especially multimedia material.p  pBasically the SeedData will be split according to a criteria and will be made available to download so users can be able to download file for criteria1, criteria2 andor criteria3 according to what they need and how much storage they want to use. The data will be provided as a .sqlite file, each of course sharing the same data model.p  pNow, there will be some small data overlap cannot be avoided in my case so it is possible that a single element be in both the set with criteria1 and the one with criteria3. Ultimately however the apps will show only a single element.p  pI have considered two approaches and I am unsure which road to take and opinions and advices would be really greatp  ol lipStatic merge where one new dataset is downloaded, data are copied from the source to the apps database and then the downloaded data is discarded. I do not like this method because a it requires double the storage space of the dataset during the load b it is likely to be very time consuming c as dataset are expected to be updated overtime, updates are likely to be hard to implement and would require again to download a big file and use twice as much size as the dataset itselfpli lipDynamic merge keeping multiple files in the sandbox Cache directory like ...Cachecriteria1em, ...Cachecriteria2em, etc which would allow to simply download the content of the folder when adding and removing the folder when discarding, and would simply require to create a virtual SeedData which would be a dynamic merge between several .sqlite files dynamic merge which would discard duplicates thus resolving the overlap. Also updates would be very easy to handle as it is then only a matter of replacing the content of a folder by downloading new content. Then, as described in the link shared earlier, I would have a UserData database which will be used rw and a SeedData composed of several datafile which will be used strictly in ronly.pli ol  pI have made many searches so far, but I couldnt a satisfactory way to achieve this or I did not understand it. I am targeting iOS 7 strictly.p  pThanks for helping if you can  Chrisp

Negative 357 pThere a quite a few questions here on this algorithm but I havent been able to find that how would it handle negative weight cycles Suppose a router x gets update from router y that cost of y to z is 5. Later, router x gets update from router y that cost of y to z is 2 now. What does router x do My understanding is that Bellman Ford algorithm states that error should be raised in this case. But what distance vector routing algorithm do  simply update it or raise an error or something elsep
Negative 357 pI hope this isnt a duplicate question. I tried searching, but had so many search results that were not relevant, I didnt have time to dig through them all.p  pI have a program that has few different versions each time I release. The differences are very small and I use a macro to control them. I want to know if it is possible to do something as followsbr 1 Have some macros that are mapped to each release version, for examplebr RELEASE2 br RELEASE3 br 2 When visual studio compiles the program, it creates a program in the Release folder as it normally does. This release is compiled as if all my release specific macros are undefined. br 3 Then visual will compile a version for each of my release specific macros. For example, a program will be output to the Release2 folder and will be compiled as if RELEASE2 is defined, and so on Release3 folder ...p  pIs this possiblep

Negative 357 pI have to generate a large PDF using a web app. The PDF is generated using a large data set of  email content for clients, right now it is written in php and what I am doing is basically looping over every item in the dataset, create an individual HTML page for each client and then add all those pages one by one to wkhtmltopdf via add page option.p  pThis is obviously not very elegant and the php dies when the input is very big, like for 1000 clients.

Negative 357 pIm making a language learning RPG. A task will be for a user to select words from a word bank that get placed into a text box.

The activity manages to add to Fragments successfully, however, upon pushing the alljokes text view an error is received. p  precode    package com.Ayman.jokeit      import android.app.Activity     import android.app.FragmentManager     import android.app.FragmentTransaction     import android.os.Bundle     import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity       public class BrowseActivity extends FragmentActivity         AllJokes afrag         OneLiners olfrag         selectFragment sfrag          RaceJokes rfrag         YoMammaJokes yfrag          LongJokes lfrag          FragmentTransaction stransaction         FragmentTransaction jtransaction         FragmentTransaction atransaction         FragmentManager jmanager         FragmentManager smanager         FragmentManager amanager         Override         protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState                afrag  new AllJokes             olfrag  new OneLiners             sfrag  new selectFragment             rfrag  new RaceJokes             yfrag  new YoMammaJokes             lfrag  new LongJokes              setContentViewR.layout.browse              Creats object for fragments               steps for adding fragment to view             smanager  getFragmentManager             jmanager  getFragmentManager              stransaction  smanager.beginTransaction             stransaction.addR.id.browselayout, sfrag, selectFragment             stransaction.commit               steps for adding fragment to view              jtransaction  jmanager.beginTransaction             jtransaction.addR.id.browselayout, olfrag, onelinerFragment             jtransaction.commit                   public void addAllJokes         afrag  new AllJokes         atransaction  amanager.beginTransaction         atransaction.replaceR.id.browselayout, afrag, afrag         atransaction.commit                 codepre  pThis is the code for the Fragment from which the OnClickListener is used.p  pThe OnClickListener calls the method alljokes within the fragment code below which refers to the the addalljokes method within the activity code above.

Negative 357 pIve migrated a custom PHP application from a Linux VPS to Windows Azure Websites, and it appeared that the only issue was the replacement of PHPmail with SendGrid. Currently this application is completely written from scratch without any framework and uses MySQL for data storage. When migrating the application, I made a .sql file and used MySQL Workbench to create the tables on my new database server.p  pThe issue that I am finding is that I can log in with current users, however, I cannot update the tables successfully. There is no sign of the application adding another row. However, the application acts as if it was a success, and continues to a success page. However, no new session is created since there wasnt a user created. p  pThe differences I can tell between the two databases is that the original table names had a capital letter while on the new db server, they are all lowercase table names.p  pIve tried changing the PHP version up and down from 5.4, and Ive not made any modifications to the MySQL statements in the code.p  pOut of your experience, what can I do to help me find the problemp  pEDITp  pHeres portion of the file that should be updating the data serverp  precodeltphp sessionstart  store session data if SESSION[employerID]ltgt      headerLocation accountdetails.php  if POST[fname]ltgt ampamp POST[email]ltgt      include configconfig.php       getConnect     stmt  insert into tblemployer shortCode,company, fName, lName,email,address,city,state,zip,password values .mysqlescapestringPOST[shortCode].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[company].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[fname].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[lname].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[email].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[address].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[city].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[state].,.mysqlescapestringPOST[zip].,.md5POST[password].     echo stmt     query  mysqlquerystmt      EIDmysqlinsertid     SESSION[employerID]EID     SESSION[userName]POST[company]     stmt  insert into tblmembership status, employerID, membershipID values 0,.EID.,.mysqlescapestringPOST[membership].     echo stmt     SESSION[MID]POST[membership]     query  mysqlquerystmt     header Location corppayment.php         gt codepre
Negative 357 pI need to create an executable that works with as many distributions as possible. I read a lot of information about this and I discovered that there are two ways static linking and dynamic linking. The first solution avoids bringing with the executable the libraries, but it has some problems with the licenses. The second solution appears the more suitable. With dynamic linking the linker adds to the executable ELF header all the references of the libraries which it needs and the operating system loads these libraries before executing the binary.p  pThe command codereadelf d ltbinarygtcode shows the needed librariesp  precodeDynamic section at offset 0x149d80 contains 33 entries Tag        Type                         NameValue 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libopencvhighgui.so.2.4] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libopencvimgproc.so.2.4] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libopencvcore.so.2.4] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libstdc.so.6] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libm.so.6] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libgccs.so.1] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libpthread.so.0] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libc.so.6] 0x000000000000000f RPATH              Library rpath [ORIGINlib] codepre  pwhile the command codeldd ltbinarygtcode shows all the libraries called from my executablep  precodelinuxvdso.so.1 gt  0x00007fffbb14c000 libopencvhighgui.so.2.4 gt homeuser.liblibopencvhighgui.so.2.4 0x00007f19398d0000 libopencvimgproc.so.2.4 gt homeuser.liblibopencvimgproc.so.2.4 0x00007f1939410000 libopencvcore.so.2.4 gt homeuser.liblibopencvcore.so.2.4 0x00007f1938fb7000 libstdc.so.6 gt homeuser.liblibstdc.so.6 0x00007f1938cb3000 libm.so.6 gt homeuser.liblibm.so.6 0x00007f19389b7000 libgccs.so.1 gt homeuser.liblibgccs.so.1 0x00007f19387a0000 libpthread.so.0 gt homeuser.liblibpthread.so.0 0x00007f1938583000 libc.so.6 gt homeuser.liblibc.so.6 0x00007f19381c3000 libtiff.so.4 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtiff.so.4 0x00007f1937f49000 libgstreamer0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstreamer0.10.so.0 0x00007f1937c62000 libgobject2.0.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgobject2.0.so.0 0x00007f1937a13000 libglib2.0.so.0 gt libx8664linuxgnulibglib2.0.so.0 0x00007f193771d000 libgstapp0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstapp0.10.so.0 0x00007f1937511000 libgstvideo0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstvideo0.10.so.0 0x00007f19372f5000 libdc1394.so.22 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibdc1394.so.22 0x00007f1937081000 libv4l1.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibv4l1.so.0 0x00007f1936e7b000 libavcodec.so.53 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibavcodec.so.53 0x00007f193606b000 libavformat.so.53 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibavformat.so.53 0x00007f1935d6a000 libavutil.so.51 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibavutil.so.51 0x00007f1935b4a000 libswscale.so.2 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibswscale.so.2 0x00007f1935904000 librt.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibrt.so.1 0x00007f19356fb000 libgomp.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgomp.so.1 0x00007f19354ec000 lib64ldlinuxx8664.so.2 0x00007f1939bca000 libjpeg.so.8 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibjpeg.so.8 0x00007f193529b000 libz.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibz.so.1 0x00007f1935084000 libgmodule2.0.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgmodule2.0.so.0 0x00007f1934e80000 libxml2.so.2 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibxml2.so.2 0x00007f1934b23000 libdl.so.2 gt libx8664linuxgnulibdl.so.2 0x00007f193491f000 libffi.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibffi.so.6 0x00007f1934717000 libpcre.so.3 gt libx8664linuxgnulibpcre.so.3 0x00007f19344d9000 libgstbase0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstbase0.10.so.0 0x00007f1934286000 liborc0.4.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnuliborc0.4.so.0 0x00007f193400b000 libraw1394.so.11 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibraw1394.so.11 0x00007f1933dfb000 libusb1.0.so.0 gt libx8664linuxgnulibusb1.0.so.0 0x00007f1933bec000 libv4l2.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibv4l2.so.0 0x00007f19339e0000 libvpx.so.1 gt usrliblibvpx.so.1 0x00007f193373a000 libvorbisenc.so.2 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibvorbisenc.so.2 0x00007f193326b000 libvorbis.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibvorbis.so.0 0x00007f193303f000 libtheoraenc.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtheoraenc.so.1 0x00007f1932e01000 libtheoradec.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtheoradec.so.1 0x00007f1932be6000 libspeex.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibspeex.so.1 0x00007f19329cd000 libschroedinger1.0.so.0 gt usrliblibschroedinger1.0.so.0 0x00007f1932719000 libgsm.so.1 gt usrliblibgsm.so.1 0x00007f193250b000 libva.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibva.so.1 0x00007f19322f5000 libbz2.so.1.0 gt libx8664linuxgnulibbz2.so.1.0 0x00007f19320e4000 libv4lconvert.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibv4lconvert.so.0 0x00007f1931e6f000 libogg.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibogg.so.0 0x00007f1931c67000 codepre  pNow I have used the option of the linker to set RPATH Wl,rpath,ORIGINlib a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRpath relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRpatha and so before the execution the linker looks as the first path the RPATH.

Negative 357 pIm an beginner learning MVC4VS2012. With many hours help from SO and Contoso University , Ive gotten my demonstration website up with an SQL db and have a trial user. About 6 months experience now. As happens the project has expanded. So some advise please.p  pMy current project has 10 models and 12 controllers, Ive just activated SimpleMembership and need to replicate all of the ASP membership stuff and then have a long way to go with role based menus etc. I will probably add 50 models and controllers to CRUD the additional models. Ive seen areas and think my solution will be much cleaner using that concept. I also see MVC5 and EF6. p  pWhen I started learning last fall, I was reluctant to upgrade to MVC5 EF6 because scaffolding was no longer supported and did not feel confident enough to workaround. Also some issue with Razor was mentioned. I now see a NUGet package for MVC scaffolding.p  pI was perusing this site today and found a post about AREAS that suggested to a person that had a single entity in a demo project, that it would be cleanest if he started over with MVC5. p  pSo please, you old timers with a much greater perspective on the work ahead, should I try to add areas and upgrade to MVC5EF6 with my current project, or keep on slogging with MVC4. p  pI have not seen any how to post relating to adding the AREAs concept to an functioning project  that is, create the AREA concept, then move existing controllers, models, etc. into a new area folder, [the work will be in registering the routes]. p  pAny forewarning of pitfalls would be appreciated.p  pA big question is can I run MVC5EF6 in VS2012 ultimate or is this a forced upgradep  pNot the normal programming question, but I hope educational enough to meet SO standards.p  pJWp

Negative 357 pI have a question regarding the dynamic creation of classes using a factory. Lets say I have have a core namespace where a frameworks base classes lie. And besides that I have a namespace for the app specific files. Now I have a factory in the cores namespace which I would use to create for example a validator class. Now there are validators which belong to the framework and validators which are application specific.p  pBesides that I have an autoloader which resolves the namespaces into the filesystem folders.p  pExample p  pload from codeappvalidatorscodep  pcodepasswordValidator  validatorFactorygtcreatePasswordValidatorcode p  pload from codecorevalidatorscodep  pcodeemailValidator  validatorFactorygtcreateEmailValidatorcode p  pThe coolest thing would be if the factory would first try to load the class from app namespace and if not possible from the core namespace. Of course I thought about implementing to the factories create method to try loading the class first from appvalidators and if an exception comes up then try loading it from corevalidators. But then I would have to implement all the create methods from the different factories that way and I wondered if there is a nice generic solution.p  pWhat is the best way to make the factory look in both namespaces for the requested classp  pPS I hope that question is not too silly due to Im relatively new to such patterns.p

Negative 357 pstrongUpdatestrong a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21997901androiddroppingtcpconnectionwhenscreenisoffIve changed some things and better clarified my question here.ap  pThis question can be closed.p  hr  pemQuick note Im coding this in C with Xamarin but any solution for regular Java and Android should apply so dont worry if your response isnt specific to C or Xamarin.emp  pIm having an issue where my android application is being shut down on me when the screen is off and it usually does so in less than a minute. It keeps running when the application is open so perhaps it has something to do with the way android is handling my application when its not in use. It doesnt happen when Im debugging the application in an IDE though, since thats probably keeping the application alive, so Im not getting any help from that. p  pThe application consists of a few activities and a service. The service sends and receives data using a tcp connection. When the application is opened, it starts with the Login Activity. Then when you login, it finishes that activity and opens the Main Activity. The Main Activity starts the Service in OnResume with codeStartService new Intent this, typeofMainServicecode.p  pThe Service is a foreground service.p  precodepublic override StartCommandResult OnStartCommand Intent intent, StartCommandFlags flags, int startId      base.OnStartCommand intent, flags, startId      ...      var ongoingNotification  new Notification Resource.Drawable.icon, Service running     var pendingIntent  PendingIntent.GetActivity this, 0, new Intent this, typeofMainActivity, 0     ongoingNotification.SetLatestEventInfo this, Service, The service is running., pendingIntent     StartForeground intNotificationFlags.ForegroundService, ongoingNotification     return StartCommandResult.RedeliverIntent   codepre  pThe part of the app that runs when it is being shut down are the Main Activity and the Service.p  pWhen I try to reopen the application, it seems like it tries to reopen the Main Activity but then fails and closes. Then when I try to reopen the application a second time it opens up the application back to the Login Activity.p  pThe service running notification continues to remain up in the notification bar the whole time though despite it losing the tcp connection when the app is shut down. This isnt good because the service needs to be working correctly for long periods of time.p

Negative 357 pTrying to change the background color of a box when it is flipped it would be much easier to show you what I mean a hrefhttpiam.colum.edustudentsjordan.maxdemodemo.php relnofollowhttpiam.colum.edustudentsjordan.maxdemodemo.phpa. I am new to jQuery and did a tutorial, and very easily able to deengineer the code and figure out what to do to make it do what I want. I did this with relative ease up until I tried to change the color of the background when the element is flipped. Its very odd, because when I use inspect element and i click the mouse thing over the object it says I set the background in element but that is nonexistent in my CSS. Not trying to be confusing this probably did sound confusing which is why I gave the link, hopefully someone knows what my issue is.p  pdemo.phpp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtml

Negative 357 pI am STUCK stuck on a conceptualpractical layout problem for the iPad.  In short, we need to show a list of entries in a TableView in landscape on the iPad, but we cant use SplitView for several reasons, and we cant push the tableview on the stack since theres so much unused space... So we cant figure out a solid way to present the table. p  pWe have a ViewController that gives people some options for searching for data in a NavigationController stack. We need a UITableView to show people a list of entries, then when they click on each entry, it goes to another ViewController that shows more data about that entry. Thats fine, but we cant just push the TableView on its own because 23rds of the screen its landscape is unused. We tried to implement a SplitView a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4213097bestwaytoswitchbetweenuisplitviewcontrollerandotherviewcontrollersbut Apple has restrictions on using one in a stacka, and we cant figure a way around it, despite it being a mostly ideal solution in our case. The other problem is that it appears we cant use a SplitView in a NavigationController stack.p  pI had made the search results TableView a subview of our main ViewController view controller, and have it slide in to show the list of entries, but then its not part of the NavigationController and there was some debate about whether thats bad practice, not to mention theres no way to go back on the navigation controller to dismiss the subview... Additionally, when they go to the entry view and go back in the navigation, the TableView is gone.p  pPlease forgive the kind of pseudoconceptual nature of our problem, here. Ive literally been grappling with this for a week and have been avoiding asking SO, since I originally didnt feel like it was the right kind of question, but Im seeing a lot of people with similar problems that seem to not have a solution  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9715396officialalternativetoimplementsplitviewasasubviewforanipadappor at least a nonhacky onea and I am totally out of ideas and at my wits end. p

If the user either clicks on the Close button or the modal window close tool  X symbol on topright corner  or even ESC button, I should prompt a confirmation messsage. If the user clicks on Yes, I should close the modal window else leave it open.p  pI have learnt that clicking on the X  close tool  or the ESC button fires a close event which in turn fires beforeclose and waits for truefalse to either destroy the modal window or keep it open.p  pemProblemem When the user clicks on X  close tol  or the ESC button, and while I debug, I see the control going to beforeclose and then the dirtyCheck function that I wrote. The dirtyCheck function also displays a Message Confirmation box, but the control doesnt wait for me to click on YesNo. It returns to beforeclose in the background and then to close. So, by the time user decides to click on either Yes or No, ExtJS has decided what to do with the modal window and hence I am losing control on whether to close the  modal window or not.p  pCould anyone please help me on what to do in such a casep

Negative 357 pI am sorry if this sounds like I am repeating this question, but I have a couple additions that I am hoping someone can explain for me.p  pI am trying to implement a packet queueing system with pipes. I have 1 thread that has a packet of data that it needs to pass to a second thread Lets call the threads A and B respectively. Originally I did this with a queueing structure that I implemented using linked lists. I would lock a Mutex, write to the queue, and then unlock the Mutex. On the read side, I would do the same thing, lock, read, unlock. Now I decided to change my implementation and make use of pipes so that I can make use of blocking when data is not available. Now for my question p  pDo I need to use Mutexs to lock the file descriptors of the pipe for read and write operationsp  pHere is my thinking.p  pI have a standard message that gets written to the pipe on writes, and it is expected to be read on the read side.p  precode struct pipemessage      int stuff     short morestuff     char  data     int length      This is where I read from the pipe  numbytesread  readreaddescriptor, ampbuffer, sizeofstruct pipemessage  ifnumbytesread  sizeofstruct pipemessage   If the message isnt full         printeError Read did not receive a full messagen       return NULL   codepre  pIf I do not use Mutexs, could I potentially read only half of my message from the pipe This could be bad because I would not have a pointer to the data and I could be left with memory leaks.p  pBut, if I use Mutexs, I would lock the Mutex on the read, attempt to read which would block, and then because the Mutex is locked, the write side would not be able to access the pipe.p

Negative 357 pI have been trying to develop a small java application. Im using JavaFX for the GUI. Im using eclipse with the a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgefxclipseindex.html relnofollowefxclipsea plugin. Everything worked fine. I was using jdk1.7.060 as me default JRE in eclipse. I decided I wanted to try and export to a runnable .jar file so I could test my application without eclipse. This is where it went wrong.p  pA while ago I installed jre8 and jdk1.8.005 on my system, for testing purposes. At first I didnt understand why my application kept giving runtime errorsExceptions while running the application, but that is because my default java is 8 now.p  pI changed my jdk in eclipse from 1.7 to 1.8 and the same errorsexceptions were given in eclipse, so Im pretty sure it has something to do with the jave8 Im running. combination between the two maybep  pIt is my first time using JavaFX so it may just be a configuration error.p  pIve tried changing my code as explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23335419codeisworkinginjdk7notinjdk8herea but it still does not work.

Negative 357 pI am using codecherrypycode along with codesqlalchemymysqlcode as backend. I would like to know the ways of dealing with UNICODE strings in codecherrypycode web application. One bruteforce way would be to convert all string coming in as parameters into codeUNICODEcode and then decoding them to codeUTF8code before storing them to database. But I was wondering if there is any standard way of handling codeUNICODEcode characters in a web application. I tried cherrypys codetools.encodecode but it doesnt seem to work for me may be I havent understood it properly yet. Or may be there are standard python libraries to handle codeUNICODEcodes which I could just import and use. What ways should I look forp
Negative 357 pThere is codejava.io.ZipInputStreamcode that inflates and codejava.io.ZipOutputStreamcodethat deflates.p  pBut sometimes I dont want that.

Negative 357 pI am writing some code for regularized logistic regression. I observe this interesting phenomena and wonder if it is a normal thing or just my code is wrong. p  pFor loss function, I am using the logistic loss function  maximize likelihood of binary variables. To make prediction, predicted probabilities are obtained for new observations and AUC is used to find the best threshhold. p  pThe funny thing is, I often run into cases where an estimated parameter has far better MSE deviance than another parameter on new observations but the prediction is worse  a lot worse. So it seems to me that mean square error might not have anything to do with the prediction performance  like the case with linear regression. Anyone saw the same thingp

Negative 357 pI use Entity Framework 6 , code first approach, together with asp.net mvc 5. p  pthe razor views are all strongly typed, and most of them use viewmodels that contain DAL models. Some views use models directly from the DAL. I am wondering what kind of security risks this. Let me demonstratep  precodepublic class SomeViewModel      public SomeModel SomeModel getset     public int OtherProperty getset   codepre  pin razor viewp  precodemodel SomeViewModel codepre  pWhat I expose to the razor view is, amongst others, 2 potentially securityrisky things the db id of the SomeModel instance, and the entitys dynamic proxy id  or whatever that is, which i guess is related to the lazy loading of the entities.p  precodeSystem.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.SomeModel2ED515217...etc codepre  pSo my plan is to make sure that all razor views utilize viewmodels ONLY. Also, all view models should exclude the above 2 mentioned things, the db id and the dynamic proxy id. p  pSo codeSomeViewModelcode would become something like thisp  precodepublic class SomeViewModel      public int SomeModelId getset     public string SomeModelPropA getset     public string SomeModelPropB getset     public int OtherProperty getset   codepre  pTo sum up, is it a good idea to be very restrictive regarding what razor views use for model  I know razor views are server side compiled, but what if a razor developer by accident use some of the forbidden view model propertiesp

Negative 357 pSo we have an angularbased miniSPA app which uses ASP.NET Identity Framework 2 for authenticationauthorization. This is fine  we can read the bearer token and all is well. However for some functionality we need to have the user access a raw MVC style route. Say we need to render an HTML view as a pdf and cant do this with clientside rendering. In that case authorization fails because the bearer token is not set by the browser. The cookies containing the relevant authorization data are present but not read. Question is, how do we authenticateauthorize those requests Weve though of the hacky method of saving the bearer token in a cookie then using an HttpModule to read it out again, but there has to be a proper way to do this...p

Negative 357 pI am building an autoresponder for my own website. I thought to put it inside an iframe to decouple its style from the theme style im  on wordpress, but this gives me two collateral effects. The first one is that the iframe is not much friendly with the responsiveness, and Im trying to address its behaviour to always show the content of the autoresponder. the second one is that the form inside the iframe has a thank you page after the submit, but with the iframe the thank you page will open inside the iframe.  There is a way to open the thank you page on the host page Am I doing this the right way there is maybe a better way to insert a piece of web page in a way that stay indipendent from the theme around itp
Negative 357 pI am working in a project where it uses two servers. My issue is when ever user clicks a language to select in login page the same language should be displayed in home page when he is logged in. For this they already implemented a cookie to pass the language selection. p  pIts working in the local machine, but not in the deployed server. Since, the local machine has only one server, but two servers on cloud, when it is deployed its jumping between the servers and not working in the deployed environment. p  pThen I used query string to pass the language selection. Still its not working in the deployed server. Guys can any one give suggestions to make it work in deployed environment.p
Negative 357 pIm new to python programming. Ive written a script to get data from an api using python 2.7.8, and now Id like to add it to an excel spreadsheet where I keep all my data.p  pIn my spreadsheet, each row is one day, but some of the data doesnt become available until up to 30 days later, so some of my columns are not full all the way to the current date. Basically, not all my column lengths are the same. p  pId like to read each column, find the highest row for that column, and then add my data points to the end of that column. If all columns were the same length, this would be simple, but I dont understand how to find the length of each column separately.p  pIve read through the docs for openpyxl, but Im new to python and I dont really understand everything. I think the solution will involve something like for each column, get the highest row, and then I would append each data point to that column. but I dont understand how to do the for each column part. Finding the length of each column would also work.p  pthanks in advancep  pEdit I came up with a work around I know the relative length of the columns so I subtracted that from the number for the last rowp  precodelastrow  ws.gethighestrow  1 colnum  1 dataRowlength  lendataRow rowoffset  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28]  for i in range0, dataRowlength  1     ws.cellrowlastrow  rowoffset[colnum  1], columncolnum.value  dataRow[i]     colnum  colnum  1 codepre

However after jumping down to my return t statement, the recursive calls are popped off the stack one by one and the last call will always send back a null .

Negative 357 pI recently encountered a problem on some computers where creation of codeNSBorderlessWindowMaskcode fullscreen window will display on the primary screen instead of the codescreen.framecode I provide. If I create a new Cocoa program with the basic window creation code, then the fullscreen window is created correctly. However, reducing the code of the original program to that of the working minimal program still creates incorrect results.p  pIf I then change the bundle identifier by adding a single character anywhere, so perhaps from codecom.blah.Programcode to codecom.blah.tProgramcode then the program works fine. Changing back to the original bundle identifier and the program stops working correctly.p  pI deleted all contents of codeLibraryDeveloperXcodecode, ensured there were no saved preferences with codedefaults delete [bundle identifier]code, deleted anything with the app name in the codeLibrarycode, and restarted the computer with no change in behavior.p  pSo in summary, I had an application with a problem. I reduced the code to the working minimal code and still had the problem. I changed the bundle identifier and the program started working correctly. I reverted the bundle identifier and the program stopped working correctly.p  pThe minimal code in question is the following in place of the default codeAppDelegate.mcode for a new Cocoa program with a single button bound to the selector codepushbuttoncodep  precodeimport AppDelegate.h  interface AppDelegate       NSWindow fullScreenWindow   property weak IBOutlet NSWindow window end  implementation AppDelegate   voidapplicationDidFinishLaunchingNSNotification aNotification       Insert code here to initialize your application    voidapplicationWillTerminateNSNotification aNotification       Insert code here to tear down your application    IBActionpushbuttonidsender      [self fullScreenWindow]    voidfullScreenWindow      NSArray screens  [NSScreen screens]     NSScreen screen  screens[1]     NSRect screenFrame  [screen frame]     NSRect frame  NSMakeRect0,0,screenFrame.size.width,screenFrame.size.height     NSWindow window  [[NSWindow alloc] initWithContentRectscreenFrame                                                    styleMaskNSBorderlessWindowMask                                                      backingNSBackingStoreBuffered                                                        deferYES]     [window orderFrontnil]     [window setFramescreenFrame displayYES animateNO]      fullScreenWindow  window   end codepre  pThe code is honestly irrelevant as I can solve the problem regardless of the bundle identifier by using codeNSZeroRectcode for codeinitWithContentRectcode, but I would like to know why the bundle identifier is causing this problem with the given code so that I can determine if the original problem was somewhere in my larger code, something in the Cocoa API, or something external entirely.p  pIs there anywhere else that something might be saved in the system Could some other program be changing the behavior of any program with my chosen bundle identifier and if so, how would I find this program Any other ideasp  pNot sure if its relevant but this is with XCode 6.1.1 on Yosemite 10.10.2 targeting OS X 10.10.p

Negative 357 pIm a bit confused about the internal implementation of codeHashSetcode and codeHashMapcode in java.p  pThis is my understanding, so please correct me if Im wrongp  pNeither codeHashSetcode or codeHashMapcode allow duplicate elements.p  pcodeHashSetcode is backed by a codeHashMapcode, so in a codeHashSetcode when we call code.addelementcode, we are calling the codehashCodecode method on the element and internally doing a codeputk,vcode to the internal codeHashMapcode, where the key is the codehashCodecode and the value is the actual object. So if we try to add the same object to the codeSetcode, it will see that the codehashCodecode is already there, and then replace the old value by the new one.p  pBut then, this seems inconsistent to me when I read how a codeHashMapcode works when storing our own objects as keys in a codeHashMapcode.  In this case we must override the codehashCodecode and codeequalscode methods and make them consistent between each other, because, if we find keys with the same codehashCodecode, they will go to the same bucket, and then to distinguish between all the entries with the same codehashCodecode we have to iterate over the list of entries to call the method codeequalscode on each key and find a match.  So in this case, we allow to have the same codehashCodecode and we create a bucket containing a list for all the objects with the same codehashCodecode, however using a codeHashSetcode, if we find already a codehashCodecode, we replace the old value by the new value.p  pIm a bit confused, could someone clarify this to me pleasep

Negative 357 pFor my c data structures class our assignment is to print a pattern of stars like thispp  pbr  br    br     br     br    br  br brp  pwith the number of lines in the pattern determined by the user input. So the pattern above would print if the user enters a 4.p  pWe had a previous assignment where we had to print the opposite pattern, one like this p     br    br    br   br  br  br   br    br    br     br pand the above pattern would print if the user enters a 5. This pattern, the one above, I had no problem with. I used a for loop to print the top half, then recursively called the function again, and then the same for loop to print the bottom half in the opposite direction. For reference, heres the code I used for the above patternpp  precodeint main      int number                                                  cout ltlt Enter the number of lines in the grid             cin gtgt number                                               printStarsnumber                                          cout ltlt endl ltlt Grid Pattern Complete  End of Program.     return 0   end of main   void printStarsint num                              if num lt 0 cout ltlt endl ltlt Please enter a non negative number. ltlt endl          else              if num  0 return                             else             for int q  1 q lt num q                   cout ltlt              cout ltlt endl              printStarsnum  1                      for int q  1 q lt num q                   cout ltlt                cout ltlt endl                   end printStars codepre  pp This function works like how I want it, so I figured I would use it as a reference to complete the second assignment. The problem Im having is that, while it was easy enough to complete the first assignment printing a line of 4 stars, then a line of 3, then a line of 2 , then a line of 1, then all that again in reverse order, I cant seem to figure out how to format the for loops to print the pattern starting with a line of  1 star, then a line of 2, then a line of 3, and so on, until its called recursively and printed again in reverse order.  pFor reference, this is the code I have so far for the second assignmentpp  precodeint main      int number                                                  cout ltlt Enter the number of lines in the grid            cin gtgt number     printStarsnumber, 0                                       cout ltlt endl ltlt Grid Pattern Complete  End of Program.      return 0   void printStarsint num, int num2    if num2 lt num           for int e  num e gt num2 e                  cout ltlt                cout ltlt endl        printStarsnum  1, num2      codepre  ppThe only thing this prints is the second half of the pattern  pIf the user enters a 5p     br    br   br  br  p p  ppAnd even to make this work, I have to recursively call the function at the end, which is out of order.  p I guess Im just confused on how this recursion is supposed to work but Ive been playing with it for hours and I cant seem to reformat it or rearrange it or restructure it so that it prints like I need it to.

Negative 357 pI created a webpage using node.js, express js, socket.io, and jquery. It is a simple game wherein players join, give themselves a name, and then move themselvesa square around a canvas on the page. What Ive noticed is when more people join the game and move around, there is enough lag to make the game unplayable at only three people connected. Two people doesnt lag it much. I cant figure out if this is serverside lag or clientside this is my first project dealing with multiplayer.

Negative 357 pIve got a Rails 4 application ready to be deployed. However, Id like to consider the possibility of doing it both in Europe and USA datacenters. The reason why is Im expecting 5050 visitors from both places, and Id like to give a really good service in both ends.p  pFor many of the tablesmodels I could use a MasterSlave replication model, as Im going to administer the content only from Europe, and changes could be pushed asyncronously to USA. However, for a few of the tables user, and userrelated content Id need some sort of MasterMaster replication, as users can generate content from each side of the ocean, and they should be able to see the content generated by the others.p  pHow can I approach this replication scenario Would a custom primary key be a good option to avoid conflict Like EUR1, EUR2, USA1, USA2.p  pIve got no experience with Postgres replication whatsoever, an easy to mantain solution would be fine, even if I had to sacrifice immediate syncing at least for user related data, I suppose the MasterSlave tables can be easily pushedp  pThank youp

Negative 357 pMy question is on the scheduling of thread blocks in CUDA specifically kepler or newer nvidia architectures after execution of a kernel has already begun.p  pFrom my understanding of the kepler architecture which may be incorrect there is a limit to the number of active blocks which can be scheduled to a single SM at any moment in time 16 blocks if I am remembering correctly. Also from my understanding blocks cannot move once they are scheduled to run on a specific SM. p  pWhat I am curious about is the block scheduling and execution behavior after the initial selection of blocks takes place and have begun executing on the device assuming that a kernel has more thread blocks than can be active in all SMs. p  pAre new blocks executed as soon as a single currently running active block completes in a SM  Or is the next set of blocks executed only after a SM completes all of its currently active blocks  Or are they started only after all SMs complete all currently active blocks executingp  pIn addition I have heard that block scheduling is fixed to a single SM. I am making the assumption it is fixed to a single SM only after the block becomes active. Is this the case p

Negative 357 pWhat is the correct implementation of handling concurrent SQL inserts while ensuring a nonprimary key column i.e. wid unique and autoincrementalp  pNote There was a design constraint that led this field i.e. wid in not becoming the primary key. A separate autoincrement PK is included in the column called id. Changing the wid to PK is not feasible as the database design is now heavily coupled to multiple software projects. So I need to devise a workaround.p  pIm thinking of 3 possible ways p  p1. Reserving the wid by executing a transaction and proceeding with other SQL statements which should have been included in the same transaction. The reservation is executed in a separate transaction to make the locking as short as possible. However, if the subsequent transaction failed e.g. due to database connection issues, then the invalidated row containing the reserved wid will remain in the table. p  precodeSTART TRANSACTION SET widd  0 SELECT COALESCEMAXwid, 0 INTO widd FROM table WHERE wid gt 0 AND wid lt 1000 FOR UPDATE INSERT INTO table wid VALUES IF widd  0, 1, widd1  COMMIT codepre  p2. Including the reservation of wid in the entire transaction to eliminate the problem of insertion of invalidated row, should the transaction fail but this approach prolongs the locking of tables.p  p3. Rely on the failure of transaction calls for reexecuting the transaction until it performs successfully should the transaction fail due to the race condition of inserting the same MAXwid  1. This approach will prevent insertion of invalidated rows but the problem is the number of times the transaction should be rerun. There is also no distinction of knowing the problem that is caused by the conflicting wid or other problems, hence, this is a problematic approach.p

Negative 357 pI have a somewhat intricate project setup consisting of several components that work together. Each component is a separate Python project that is hosted as a uWSGI application behind an Nginx proxy. The components interact with each other and with the outside world through the proxy.p  pI noticed myself about to cutandpaste some code from one component to another, as they perform similar functions, but interact with different services. Obviously, I want to avoid this, so I am going to pull out common functionality and put it into a separate library project, to be referenced by the different components.p  pI am running these apps in a virtual environment using virtualenv, so it should theoretically be easy to simple drop the library project into .envincludes.p  pHowever, I have a bit of a strange setup. First of all, I am running the project from varwww i.e. uWSGI hosts the apps from here, but the projects actually are present in another source controlled directory. For various reasons, I dont want to move them, so I created symlinks for the project directories in varwww. This works fine. However, now I have a potential problem, namely, where do I put the library project which is currently in the same directory as the other components, which I also want to symlinkp  pDo I symlink it in .envincludes And if so, how should I reference the library from my other components Do I reference it from sys.path or as a sibling directory Is NginxuWSGI with virtualenv following the symlinks and taking into account the actual directory or is it blindly assuming that everything is in varwwwp  pI have not tried either approach because there seems to be a massive scope for problems, so I wanted to get some input first. Needless to say, I am more than a little confused.p

Negative 357 pThis may sound like a silly question, but most of my experience with iOS development has revolved around Auto Layout being prominent, and Im curious now for performance purposes how Id go about laying out a cell without Auto Layout and using only frames and perhaps autoresizing masks.

Negative 357 pAfter testing some iOS apps communicating with OSX apps over HTTP, I recognized sometime communication problems. The communication is done over a HTTPserver and clients. In former times it worked great, but after the introduction of OSX 10.10 I often recognized such problems.

Negative 357 pIm working on a page which uses Accordion and Sortable together, following a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditTGIeeEbbvJwpJ3WRqo2zppreview relnofollowthis Plunkera but while most things are behaving correctly, my accordion panels are not collapsing correctly. The header rows are moving correctly but the body of each accordion section is not being hidden and is showing under the following heading.p  pIve had a look at whats happening in the examples and it seems that when the header is clicked to collapse the panel, the panel momentarily gains a codecollapsingcode class which then gets replaced with a codecollapsecode class which hides the panel.

Negative 357 pI am testing an IOS app that we developed for the iPhone 4 ie a smaller screen size and now when testing it on iPhone5 the view controllers do not expand to use the bigger iPhone 5 screen.  p  pThe view controllers remain the same size fitted for the iPhone 4 and therefore leave a black strip above and below all view controllers in the app.p  pIve tried changing the size of the view controllers in story board by changing the Simulated Size parameter from Fixed to Freeform and setting the width and height to 320x568 for iPhone 5.  This changes the view controllers in storyboard just fine making them look taller but when I run in the simulator or on an iPhone5 the view controllers do not change size to use the expanded space on the iPhone5.p  pAny ideas anyone  thanks in advancep
