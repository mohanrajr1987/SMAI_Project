Positive 78326 pIm really pulling my hair out on this one. I need to loop over some selected items, consisting both of checkboxes and select lists, and compile an array of the selected models.p  pThis is eluding me because codecheckedcode and the selects codevaluecode work differently. I was trying to simply store the selected option in a parent model with a selectedOption observable. This worked fine for codeltselectgtcode because it saved a reference to the model, but with checkboxes, it would only save a boolean value.p  pI tried setting a flag on the model itself, which is fine for checkboxes, but I cant access individual options to let them know that theyre the current selection in a codeselectcode list.p  pAll models populating checkboxes and dropdown lists are of the same type, Im just displaying them differently depending on certain internal properties.p  pHow can I simply collect the models of all selected options from both checkboxes and select listsp  pEdit Adding samples.

Positive 78326 pIm trying to create a custom component loader within codeknockoutcode but Im struggling with the view model. Essentially I want to remotely go grab both the HTML template and the JavaScript view model, but in this instance I dont want to use a traditional AMD module loader.p  pIve managed to get some of this working, specifically loading the HTML template but I cant figure out how to load the view model. Before I start heres my directory structurep  p index.htmlbr  customerLoader.jsbr  compsbr      myCustom.htmlbr      myCustom.jsp  pSo Ive created my component loader like so. codegetConfigcode basically takes the name of the component and turns that into a path for the viewModel and the html template.p  precodevar customLoader       getConfig functionname, callback          callback template comps  name  .html, viewModel comps  name  .js      ,     loadTemplate functionname, templateConfig, callback          console.logloadTemplate, name, templateConfig         .gettemplateConfig, functiondata              callbackdata              ,     loadViewModel functionname, templateConfig, callback          console.logloadViewModel, name, templateConfig         .getScripttemplateConfig, functiondata              callbackdata                 ko.components.loaders.unshiftcustomLoader codepre  pThis successfully makes a request to load the template, which brings back some basic content. What Im struggling with is the view model. Im not sure what should be in the target of my JavaScript filep  pI assumed that Id want to return a function that would take some parameters, most likely a codeparamscode object. However if I try and do this I get an error, telling me the JavaScript is invalidp  blockquote   pUncaught SyntaxError Illegal return statementp blockquote  pThis is the current content Ive got that is producing this errorp  precodereturn functionparams       console.logmyCustom.js, name, viewModelConfig       Add a computed value on     params.bookNum  ko.computedfunction          switchthis.title              case A return 1             case B return 2             case C return 3             default return 1                    ko.components.defaultLoader.loadViewModelname, viewModelConstructor, callback   codepre  pSo ultimately Im not sure how to achieve this, but I guess there are 3 basic questions that explain the gaps in my understandingp  ol liWhat should my view model JavaScript file contain exactly A function An object etc...li liDo I need to call the codeko.components.defaultLoader.loadViewModelcode at allli liWithin my codecustomLoadercode what should codeloadViewModelcode be doing with the result of the jQuery callback Im not sure if I get back a JavaScript object, or just a string li ol  pIm open to achieve this in a different way if need be e.g. not using jQuery but getting files a different way, but I dont want to use a module loader e.g. require.jscurl.js in this instance.p

Positive 78326 pIm working on an Single Page Application and were using Knockout quite extensively. Weve currently got a list of item that can be clicked, and upon doing so theyll load some content into a modal container. The image below illustrates the different items thatll trigger various content to be displayedp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comc7QGd.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc7QGd.png altenter image description hereap  pThe content of these containers differs substantially, and can have many different custom bindings spread over several tabs. The items in the image are fairly simple and just use Knockout Components but when we start displaying the modal contents they are much more heavy on the JavaScript hence using bindings.p  pIve recently added in lazy loading of the JavaScript and HTML templates required by the components and this has worked really well. Ive had to use a custom component loader as for various reasons we dont want to use require or similar AMD module loader. p  pNow Im faced with the same issue with custom knockout bindings, as I expect we could end up with 100 hundred bindings quite easily as this product expands. Unfortunately there doesnt seem to be an obvious way to load custom bindings in a lazy way like components though, and Im trying to figure out if theres a way to do this, and what the best way would be. Note that I also dont know the name of the binding up front all of the time, sometimes I may wish to load them dynamically based on the name of an observable.p  pThe only things Ive managed to find of note so far, are that there is a codeko.getBindingHandlercode function which can be overridden, but it requires a synchronous load of a binding handler.p  hr  pI have thought of an approach to try and do this, but it uses components and feels like a really backward way of achieving my end goal. Itd be something like thisp  pReplace a usual custom bindingp  precodeltdiv databindlineChart datagt  codepre  pwithp  precodeltdiv databindcomponent  name compName, params  vm data  gt codepre  pId then use a custom component loader, which is actually just loading the binding handler JavaScript, and writing out essentially a placeholder codedivcode with the custom binding inp  precodevar bindingLoader      getConfig functionname, callback        ifname.startsWithbinding           callback binding name.replacebinding, , jsUrl bindings  name           return              callbacknull    ,   loadComponentname, componentConfig, callback       var obj         obj.template  ltdiv databind  componentConfig.name   datagt      .ajax url componentConfig.jsUrl, dataType text         .donefunctiondata             new Functiondata            callbackobj           codepre  pIm sure however there must be a better way of achieving this, but I cant think of any other options right now.p

Positive 78326 pI have developed a tree view that uses knockout to display a hierarchy.  I have noticed a weird situation within chrome that happens when I collapse a node in the tree.  The text for the node disappears along with the items under it.  I figured I had something wrong with my code and then figured out that it works correctly in both IE and firefox.  I created the fiddle below that demonstrates the issue with any extra code from my page stripped out.  If you expand a node and then collapse it the plus button does not change to a minus as it would in my full code, the text disappears.

Positive 78326 pI have an observable array of formFields which is rendered to a list of input  select fields on my form.p  pEach field is a separate viewModel and rendered according to its own fieldType property for example  firstName, lastName, creditCardNumber etc.... p  pIn the database, I keep formTypes definition. For each formType, there is a mapping of all the fields that are displayed for this form type for example  formTypeAddress will have this list of formFields  Street, City, Country, ZipCode etc...p  pThis way, I can create different forms dynamically depending on the form definition and its corresponding formFields.p  pNow, my problem is that I want to use knockout validation to validate the observableArray itself of the formFields in addition to each specific formField separate validation which works fine.

Negative 78326 pI was searching a lot through Qt forums and Google for the last few days, but I could not find any obvious answer to this question.p  pI found the codeprefixcode option not even documented on Windows that can be supplied to configure to specify different install directory, but this is not clear separation of the sources and binaries at all, since the build is still done in the source directory and then the files needed for installation are copied to the install directoy. I tried this codeprefixcode option, and came to some problems. i.e It doesnt  copy the code.pdbcode files to the install directory.p  pThen I found a hrefhttpdoc.trolltech.commainsnapshotshadowbuildswince.htmlthis linka about doing shadow builds but it has the big limitation that the build dir must be at the same level as the source dir.p  hr  blockquote   pIm guessing you didnt try make   install So try that. It should   install Qt to a separate directory   away from the sources.p blockquote  pAre you saying that after I do configure, I should do nmake install instead just nmake I know that nmake will process the generated makefiles from qmake and will place them in the source Qt dir, but what nmake install will exactly do i.e in which directory will install the files and how to specify the directory where the files will be installed.p  pNote that I already do thisp  precodeconfigure prefix builddir platform win32msvc2005 nmake install codepre  pThe effect of the above two lines was that qt was compiled in the source dir and not directly to my builddir specified with prefix. Then the compiled files were copied in my builddir. I was hoping for something that will build my Qt files directly to the build dir, cause this way I  stil need 4 Gb space for my source dir during the compilation. Also the pdb files were not copied to my buildir which is another issue.p

Negative 78326 pI am just beginning to learn how to write software that accesses an SQL server.  It seems that each server implementation Postgres, MySQL, etc. offers API libraries for various languages my code is in C and C, though solutions for Java and Python would also interest me.

Am I right even so farp  pMoreover, do any such libraries provide an objectoriented interface  It would be nice to not simply embed SQL queries into another, more featureful language Id like to have a wrapper that mimics the style of the rest of the language, too.p  pSo is there a preferred solution along those lines  Am I asking for something weirdp

Negative 78326 pI have a JWindow and a JFrame both I have made runnable and both implement a mouse listener. I have alot of testing to do for a project of mine and to simplify it I wish to be able to automate most of it, so I have starting my own mouse recorder and replayer uses Java Robot Class.p  pemKinda like a simplified AutoHotKey or AutoIt thing... but itll run on my Ubuntu machine aswell as my Windows oneemp  pThe JWindow I have made is translucent and covers the entire screen, when you click on it it disappears and replays the click to the object behind and then reappears. This is the recording process. When the User right clicks the  is set to not visible and the recorded actions are replayed.p  pDuring replay I want the option to be able to exit the entire application and so I though the best way to do this would be to make the JFrame and the JWindow Runnable.p  pThe JFrame is simply their to offer a close option from the application.p  pSo, in my Main class I havep  precodepublic static void MainString[] args     recorder  new Recorder     gui  new GUI     Thread tr  new Threadrecorder     Thread tg  new Threadgui     tr.setNameRecorder     tg.setNameGUI     tr.start     tg.start  codepre  pMy understanding is Recorder and GUI are runnable objects and they are made into threads via the new Thread command. When I use .start I am beginning the execution of the thread and from here on the system decides which thread is running at any particular time.p  pOnto the Recorder and GUI classes.p  precodepublic class Recorder         implements Runnable, MouseListener   Constructor and other code      public void mouseClickedMouseEvent e           if e.getButton  MouseEvent.BUTTON1               Record events         else              Replay events                  System.exit0           public void run          System.out.printlnRecorder        public class GUI      implements Runnable, MouseListener   Constructor, simply constructs JFrame and sets mouselistener to it     public void mouseClickedMouseEvent e         System.exit0         public void run          System.out.printlnGUI       codepre  pMy application prints out Recorder and then GUI Allows me to record my events then right click on the JWindow to replay them...p  pbut then when I click on the JFrames close button or even in the frame because of the mouse listener it wont exit until all of the actions have been fully replayedp  pOne thing I did wonder is what ever I put in run is what is what keeps the thread running So when System.out.println is executed the thread dies So I tried a while loop around them and my application successfully printsp  pGUI GUI GUI RECORDER RECORDER GUI RECORDER etc etcp  pSo I can see that they threads are running concurrently... its just that all of the other actions outside of the run dont seem to get executed... How can I include my mouse listener, etc within the threads executionp

Negative 78326 pIm working on a heavily databound Win.Forms application where Ive found some strange behavior. The app has separate IO threads receiving updates through asynchronous webrequests which it then sends to the mainGUI thread for processing and updating of applicationwide datastores which in turn may be databound to various GUIelements, etc.. The server at the other end of the webrequests requires periodic requests or the session times out.p  pIve gone through several attempted solutions of dealing with threadissues etc. and Ive observed the following behaviorp  ol lipIf I use Control.Invoke for sending updates from IOthreads to mainthread and this update causes a MessageBox to be shown the main forms message pump stops until the user clicks the okbutton. This also blocks the IOthread from continuing eventually leading to timeouts on the server.pli lipIf I use Control.BeginInvoke for sending updates from IOthreads to mainthread the main forms message pump does emnotem stop, but if the processing of an update leads to a messagebox being shown, the processing of the rest of that update is halted until the user clicks ok. Since the IOthreads keep running and the message pump keeps processing messages several BeginInvokes for updates may be called before the one with the message box is finished. This leads to outofsequence updates which is unacceptable.pli lipIOthreads add updates to a blocking queue very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions530211creatingablockingqueuetinnet530228530228httpstackoverflow.comquestions530211creatingablockingqueuetinnet530228530228a. GUIthread uses a Forms.Timer that periodically applies all updates in the blocking queue. This solution solves both the problem of blocking IO threads and sequentiality of updates i.e. next update will be never be started until previous is finished. However, there is a small performance cost as well as introducing a latency in showing updates that is unacceptable in the long run. I would like updateprocessing in the mainthread to be eventdriven rather than polling.pli ol  pSo to my question. How should I do this top  ol liavoid blocking the IOthreads li liguarantee that updates are finished insequenceli likeep the main message pump running while showing a message box as a result of an update.li ol  pUpdate See solution belowp

Negative 78326 pIm having a weird issue with form painting in the Compact Framework. I have a login dialog that is basically a small form that is opened on top of another using ShowDialog. When a card is swiped, the login dialog is supposed to close, then some login tasks are performed and then the form behind it should be activated. The problem is that the form behind the login dialog is not being refreshed and so the login dialog will not be removed until after the form behind is refreshed by some user action. This is probably due to the heavy processing that goes on in the login tasks part, but Ive not found a way to solve this.p  pBasically, I want a way to force the application to close the dialog and paint everything again, before performing the heavy login tasks. Ive tried numerous refresh methods without any luckp  precodeForm loginDialog  new Form DialogResult result  loginDialog.ShowDialog loginDialog.Dispose  Ive tried everything at this point to get the form to refresh before performing login tasks this.Refresh this.Invalidate Application.DoEvents   PerformHeavyLoginTasks codepre  pDoes anyone know what could be going wrong Thanksp

This seems normal behaviour to me, but I need a way around it. p  pExtending EditText and overriding onKeyUp is not a good idea, see a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicandroiddevelopersRIxGfx5qOjMhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicandroiddevelopersRIxGfx5qOjMa.p  pThe KeyboardView class has exactly what I need invalidateKey, but I think that is only accessible when you create your own input method.  p  pAnybody else have some better ideas p

Negative 78326 pHow do I diff two binary filesp  pI have two versions of a program, version 1 and version 2. Ive made a small number of changes between the two version, but unfortunately havent been backing up regularly, and so although Ive got the source for version 2, I only have the binary of version 1. I need to find out what, exactly, I changed between the two versions. Ive tried creating an objdump of the two versions and then using diff to find the changes, but that doesnt work because the offsets are different, and so diff considers almost every line to have changed.p  pFor example, one line might be codebgez v0,4074d0ltdaemonize0xd4gtcode in version 1, and codebgez v0,4073d4ltdaemonize0xd4gtcode in version 2. These are copied directly from the dump files  you can see the two lines do the same thing, but diff cant distinguish them. The files are too big for me to examine every line manually How do I detect functionality changes, while ignoring differences in offsetp

Negative 78326 pIm looking at ways to deterministically replace unique strings with unique and optimally short replacements. So I have a finite set of strings, and the best compression I could achieve so far is through an enumeration algorithm, where I order the input set and then replace the strings with an enumeration of char strings over an extended alphabet a..z, A...Z, aa...zz, aA... zZ, a0...z9, Aa..., aaa...zaa, aaA...zaaA, .....p  pThis works wonderfully as far as compression is concerned, but has the severe drawback that it is not atomic on any given input string. Rather, its result depends on knowing strongallstrong input strings right from the start, and on the strongorderingstrong of the input set.p  pAnybody knows of an algorithm that has similar compression but doesnt require knowing all input strings upfront Hashing for example would not work for me, as depending on the size of the input set Id need a hash length of 812 for the hashes to be unique, and that would be too long as replacements currently, the replacement strings are 13 chars long for my use cases lt10,000 input strings. Also, if theoreticians among us know this is wasted effort, I would be interested to hear  .p

I get a number of IDs from the database,split them in to equal chunks so that they are handed out to Producer threads to process. A producer thread receives a list of IDs and processes each sequentially, retrieving data for each of of the IDs and submitting that data to a Consumer thread to process. Now my question is thisp  pI create 10 producer threads above. And I want the size of the Consumer thread pool to be 20. But, while processing each ID, the Producer creates a new Runnable Consumer and submits execute it to the Consumer executor service. My understanding of the ExecutorService is that the Runnable that you submit to it,gets wrapped in a Worker thread and then executed. So, in the above code, if the number of IDs each producer gets is 50, am I actually creating 5010500 Consumer threads Is it too many p  pOr does the pool size actually means the number of worker threads So in the above code I am creating 500 tasks on the Consumer executor which would actually be queued and executed by 20 worker threads I may not be explaining this correctly, but slightly confused here around the internal implementation of the executor and worried if I am creating too many Consumer threads.p  pIf this isnt the way to implement this, can someone suggest a better approach Thanks.p

Negative 78326 pNew to NetBeans dev here. When I first created my project and began compiling, I noticed that NetBeans had automatically created a codedistcode directory under my project root and was creating an Executable JAR in that directory.p  pIve now been developing for several weeks, and added many resource files to my project, including a system log file, an embedded SQLite database, and several properties files. These are files that my program a Swing app needs to readwrite from at runtime in order to function correctly.p  pI just noticed this morning that the Executable JAR in my codedistcode directory is several weeks old, and that compiling my project doesnt update it.  I am wondering if thats because there are now all these new resource files and NetBeans doesnt know howwhere to package them for the automaticallycreated Executable JAR.p  pDoes this mean that Ill have to tweak the build.xml myself Or is there a NetBeans dialog I can get to where I can specify where to pacakge everything And if NetBeans should be doing this automatically, what could be the reason that it stopped creating the JAR for me, and what can I do to force this functionality againp  pI went into strongProject Properties  Packagingstrong and made sure that the emJAR fileem directory was still codedistMyProgram.jarcode and that the checkbox emBuild JAR after compilingem was still checked, so obviously something else is either breaking the build or messing with NB.p  pThanks for any tipsp

Negative 78326 pEdit Quoting myself because I summarized the issue much better in one of the comments belowp  blockquote   pI have a condition that is true when the package is installed, but   not true when it is removed. I expected MSI to remember that it had   installed the conditional component and remove it with the uninstall,   but this is not the case. I am trying to find out A the proper way to   clean up this orphaned component, and B the best way to protect   against this problem in the future.p blockquote  pI guess my question boils down to, is it safe to just delete an orphaned featurecomponent after a product is uninstalled  And is there any way to check what, if anything, is still referencing a component that I believe to be an orphan  And how do I fix my installer to keep this from happening in the futurep  pWe have a wix project to install a library, Foo.  This installer puts copies of Foo.dll into the GAC, and a folder, codeProgram FilesReference AssembliesFooltversiongtcode by default.  The installer also adds two registry keys, one is a custom key which stores the path of the Foo folder for reuse in future installs, the other tells Visual Studio to include the full codeltversiongtcode folder path in its search for installed libraries so that Foo shows up in the Add References dialog.  Multiple versions of the Foo library can be installed on the machine at a time, each will be located in the appropriate codeltversiongtcode folder under Foo.p  pFoo 2.0.0 had a bug that slipped through testing, Foo 2.0.1 contained the bug fix, no other changes.  It was decided that since the bug fix was the only change, we would add a policy file to the GAC which would redirected references for Foo 2.0.0 to Foo 2.0.1.  This policy file was added to the installer as a new component inside of a new feature.  An upgrade tag was added to detect and remove Foo 2.0.0 when Foo 2.0.1 was installed.  The installation of the policy feature was made conditional on Foo 2.0.0 being detected.  Everything seemed to be working and Foo 2.0.1 was pushed out.p  pNow, a year later, we discover that we again missed noticing a bug, this time in the installer setup rather than the library code.  It turns out that when Foo 2.0.1 replaces 2.0.0, and is then uninstalled, the policy file is orphaned and remains in the GAC while all other files and keys are removed.  I have tested this on a clean install of windows virtual machines can be so useful and confirmed that the problem can be replicated, i.e. no additional references to the component have snuck in to cause it to stay behind.  p  pAll of this was originally done in WiX 3.0 but we have recently moved up to using WiX 3.5.  Our WiX code looks like thisp  precodeltProduct IdGuid 1 NameFoo v2.0.1 Language1033 Version2.0.1 ManufacturerMy Team UpgradeCodeGuid 2gt    ltPackage InstallerVersion300 Compressedyes gt    ltMedia Id1 Cabinetmedia1.cab EmbedCabyes gt    ltUpgrade IdGuid 2gt     ltUpgradeVersion Minimum2.0.0 Maximum2.0.0 IncludeMaximumyes IncludeMinimumyes OnlyDetectno PropertyUPGRADE2X0X0gtltUpgradeVersiongt   ltUpgradegt    ltProperty IdFOODIRgt     ltRegistrySearch IdFooPath Typedirectory RootHKLM KeySoftwareFoo NameInstallPathgtltRegistrySearchgt   ltPropertygt    ltDirectory IdTARGETDIR NameSourceDirgt     ltDirectory IdProgramFilesFoldergt       ltDirectory IdRefAssemb NameReference Assembliesgt         ltDirectory IdFOODIR NameFoogt           ltComponent IdFooLibPath GuidGuid 3gt             ltRegistryKey RootHKLM KeySoftwareFoo ActioncreateAndRemoveOnUninstallgt               ltRegistryValue NameInstallPath Typestring Value[FOODIR] KeyPathyesgtltRegistryValuegt             ltRegistryKeygt           ltComponentgt           ltDirectory IdFOOVERSION Namev2.0.1gt             ltComponent IdFooVSFile GuidGuid 4gt               ltFile IdFooDLL Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1Foo.dll KeyPathyesgtltFilegt             ltComponentgt             ltComponent IdFooVSRegKey GuidGuid 5gt               ltRegistryKey RootHKLM KeySOFTWAREMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv3.5AssemblyFoldersExFoo v2.0.1 ActioncreateAndRemoveOnUninstallgt                 ltRegistryValue Typestring Value[FOOVERSION] KeyPathyesgtltRegistryValuegt               ltRegistryKeygt             ltComponentgt             ltDirectory IdFOOGAC NameGACgt               ltComponent IdFooGAC GuidGuid 6gt                 ltFile IdFoo Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1Foo.dll KeyPathyes Assembly.netgtltFilegt               ltComponentgt               ltComponent IdFooPolicy2x0x1 GuidGuid 7gt                 ltFile IdFooPolicyDLL Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1policy.2.0.Foo.dll KeyPathyes Assembly.netgtltFilegt                 ltFile IdFooPolicyConfig Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1policy.2.0.Foo.config CompanionFileFooPolicyDLLgtltFilegt               ltComponentgt             ltDirectorygt           ltDirectorygt         ltDirectorygt       ltDirectorygt     ltDirectorygt   ltDirectorygt    ltFeature IdProductFoo Level1gt        ltComponentRef IdFooGACgt        ltFeature IdFooVSSupport Level1gt         ltComponentRef IdFooLibPathgt         ltComponentRef IdFooVSFilegt         ltComponentRef IdFooVSRegKeygt       ltFeaturegt        ltFeature IdFooPolicyv2x0x1 Level0gt         ltComponentRef IdFooPolicy2x0x1gt         ltCondition Level1gtUPGRADE2X0X0ltConditiongt       ltFeaturegt    ltFeaturegt  ltProductgt codepre

Negative 78326 pI am using the same stylesheet for the main site as well as a preview of the site NOT in an iframe because I need it to be interactive. The issues is, the preview does not take up 100 of the screen width, so when media queries are based on screen size, the page behaves oddly. I am ok with making the editorpreview mode fixed width, though, so I thought perhaps there is some way I can disable the mediaqueries under certain conditions I have no idea how to approach that, though. Either through javascript, or potentially loading an additional, generic stylesheet after the mediaqueries that would somehow reset things.p  pOtherwise I may have to make alternate stylesheets, which would be a pain to maintain, or redesign the page so that the preview area is 100 of the width.p

Negative 78326 pJust have a quick question. Ive looked around the internet quite a bit  and Ive found a few solutions but none of them have worked yet. Looking at converting a string to an int and I dont mean ASCII codes.p  pFor a quick rundown, we are passed in an equation as a string. We are to break it down, format it correctly and solve the linear equations. Now, in saying that, Im not able to convert a string to an int.p  pI know that the string will be in either the format 5 or 25 etc. so its definitely an int. But how do we extract that from a stringp  pOne way I was thinking is running a forwhile loop through the string, check for a digit, extract all the digits after that and then look to see if there was a leading , if there is, multiply the int by 1.p  pIt seems a bit over complicated for such a small problem though. Any ideasp

Negative 78326 pI have a SQLite backed database of roughly 4000 rows, connected to Core Data. The model is a simple overview  detail model. Each overview with title and subtitle has a relationship to a detail, which contains detailed information. To view this data I have implemented a UITableView with a NSFetchedRequestController.p  precodeNSSortDescriptor sort  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyregisteredname ascendingYES] NSArray sortDescriptors  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsort]  NSPredicate filterPredicate  nil NSString sectionName  nil NSString cacheName  nil  NSFetchedResultsController aFetchedResultsController  nil aFetchedResultsController.delegate  self NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]  [fetchRequest setFetchBatchSize20] [fetchRequest setSortDescriptorssortDescriptors]  NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameInfo inManagedObjectContextself.managedObjectContext] [fetchRequest setEntityentity]  [fetchRequest setPredicatefilterPredicate] aFetchedResultsController  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequestfetchRequest managedObjectContextself.managedObjectContext sectionNameKeyPathsectionName cacheNamecacheName]  NSError error  nil if [aFetchedResultsController performFetchamperror]    NSLogUnresolved error , , error, [error userInfo]   abort   [fetchRequest release] [sort release] return aFetchedResultsController codepre  pI have implemented everything and it works, but it works slowly. Specifically Im concerned with the application launch.p  pThis is the query that slows things down on launch time SQL debug flag in XCodep  precodeCoreData sql SELECT 0, t0.ZPK FROM ZINFO t0 ORDER BY t0.ZREGISTEREDNAME CoreData annotation sql connection fetch time 0.8773s  CoreData annotation total fetch execution time 0.8976s for 4302 rows.  codepre  pThis happens immediately after performFetch is executed. Why does Core Data feel the need to get and sort all 4302 rows of my database If I set the setLimit to a small value, say 20, of course everything works extremely fast, but I only get 20 results displayed. On the other hand, I now have setBatchSize, which works great, and I can see the SELECT statements in the debug console, as I scroll the table view. But it still sorts 4302 rows at launch, which I feel is unnecessarily slowing down app launch time.p  pI intend to implement a normalized string sorting and a caseInsensitiveNumericCompare selector in NSSortDescriptor, as per Apples WWDC 2010 sample code, but it seems to me Im missing something simple here.p  h1Updateh1  pSeems that I cant use a custom selector caseInsensitiveNumericCompare with NSSortDescriptor, since I am using SQLite as the database. I really dont see what more I can do, to speed this up. Maybe SQLite will sort faster with shortened and normalized string, this is what Im trying next.p  h1Update 2h1  pWith normalized string no other letters or symbols except AZ and 09, the launch time is down to about 0.7s. Not a big reduction. The last thing Im trying is presorting the database and then assigning incremental ids to the rows. In NSSortDescriptor I will then sort by this numerical id. According to my SQL tests, it should be roughly 7x faster. p

Negative 78326 pHeres a scenario There are users, users have skills. If a user specifies new skill, it needs to be added, however if user specifies existing skill  it should link to the existing one.  So, setup is pretty basic  3 tables users, skills, userSkillsLink. Its a web app, but I dont want to add every skills theres in a drop down  so I wont know if skill exists right away. I could check if skill already exists using select, but in web app thats not the best choice  not thread safe. I can keep a track of which skills already exist in a separate cache, but this problem should be.. very common, so Im thinking maybe Im overcomplicating, and theres a known solution already.p  pThanks p

Negative 78326 pIm working on GWT project where we are using a hrefhttpgooglewebtoolkit.googlecode.comsvnjavadoclatestcomgooglegwtuserclientuiFlexTable.htmlFlexTablea to display some data. I know that we should probably be using a hrefhttpgooglewebtoolkit.googlecode.comsvnjavadoclatestcomgooglegwtusercellviewclientCellTable.htmlCellTablea as it has better performance, but FlexTable is easier to style style specific cells and makes it easier to update specific cell.p  pTo receive updates for the table were using WebSockets. The problem were facing right now is high CPU load when therere more than 100 updates per second coming through WebSockets. Each message from WebSocket connection contains updates for several cells in the table. So in practice therere more than 100 updates per second that should be rendered in the FlexTable. CPU load on my 3GHz i5 with 4GB RAM is around 50. If I disable actual rendering of the data comment out setText method calls then CPU load goes down to 510. So I know that DOM updates are the bottleneck, not the other parts of the code.p  pWould it be better top  ol liuse Grid insteadli liswitch to CellTable but how to make singe cell updates thenli liuse JSJSNI to work with DOM instead of FlexTable setTextli ol  pAre there better ways to implement table and improve performancep  pIve tried to google if someone had similar problems with FlexTable, but found only the general opinion that it is just slow, nothing specific. We have application prototype done purely in JavaScript and with same 100 updates per second CPU load is around 15p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr Dropping css fade effect which we used to indicate change in the cell value reduced CPU load by 10. So it seems that the DOM is not the only problem.p

Negative 78326 pIn a wellbehaved C program, shall the return statement RET always return to the instruction following the CALL statement I know this is the default, but I would like to check if anyone knows or remembers authentic examples of cases where this standard does not apply common compiler optimization or other things.... Someone told me that it could happen with a function pointer the function pointer would put the value on the stack, instead of the CALL... I searched for it but I did not see an explanation anywhere.p  pLet me try to better explain my question. I know that we can use other structures to change the execution flow including manipulating the stack... I understand that if we change the return address written on the stack the execution flow will change to the address that was written on the stack. What I need to know is is there any not unusual execution situation where the next instruction is not the one that follows the CALL I mean, I would like to be sure that it doesnt happen, unless something unexpected occurs like a memory access violation that would lead to a structured exception handler.p  pMy concern is whether the commercial application programs in general ALWAYS follow the mentioned pattern. Notice that in this case I have a fixation for exceptions it is important to know whether they exist in this case, for a research project Im developing into a M. Sc. programs discipline. I know, for example, that a compiler may, sometimes, change a RET to a JMP tailcall optimization. I would like to know if something like this may change the order of the instruction that is executed after the RET and, mainly, if the CALL will always be just before the instruction executed after the RET.p

Im familiar with the various ORMs that can create the classes.  What Im looking for is something that will generate the LoadDataIntoListOfTickets listing with a line of source code for each ROW in the database. Hopefully that makes it clear.p  pClarification 2 This is going to be used to replace having SQL INSERT statements in a text file for initializing tables when the user creates a new database for an application. Having a text file with the SQL INSERT statements allowed me to use traditional version control tools to manage our database initialization process.  It works really well, but it isnt as human readable whitespace  alignment or reusable as storing the data in DTO instances would be.  Serializing to XML would reduce readability. Binary serialization would by nature make it NOT human readable and would also make it near impossible to do a meaningful comparemerge with previous versions.p  pDoes anyone know of a tool or library that can do this p

Negative 78326 pI have a java web application running on Amazon EC2 on a single instance, running in the Ireland EU West region, which makes HTTP requests to UK based sites and APIs as it happens, using the Apache HttpClient.br When running on a local Tomcat server here in the UK, everything works as expected, but when deployed on EC2, the application is no longer making requests from the UK, so everything breaks down as the websites restrict access from outside the UK and the APIs return US region specific data.br The obvious solution seems to be to route the HTTP requests via a UK proxy server, which Id expect would resolve the issue, but would degrade performance a little and provide an extra point of failure e.g. if the proxy server were blacklisted. As its a web application, I could also move some of the request logic out to the browser e.g. through XHR GETs in Javascript, though theres a fair amount of processing to be done, and Id rather keep the bulk of it server side.br Is there any way to configure EC2 or the requests to get around this issue, or is there an alternativebetter solutionp

Negative 78326 pFirst of all, sorry for my english since its not my native language.p  pProblem was happened in my .NET Windows Forms Application and reproduced only on Virtaul PC Windows 7 x64 for some reasons.  p  pI faced with Win32Exception in one place of my application when resizing main application form containing a lot of custom controls, including two stacked to each other tabcontrols etc... Exceptions message was Error creating window handle. Spending some time I found solution for that problem on Microsoft Support site. It was very similar to my case. Qoute from the sitep  blockquote   pIn .NET applications, docked controls sometimes do not resize when their parents are resized if they are deeply nested.  This problem occurs on both 64bit and on 32bit platforms, but requires a deeper nesting level on 32bit systems. p      pWhat happens is that when the top level control lays out, SetBoundsCore calls SetWindowPos to resize the child controls. Each child control receives a WMWINDOWPOSCHANGED notification, which triggers a layout event, which calls SetBoundsCore, which calls SetWindowPos.  Each call to SetWindowPos goes into kernel mode and then back out to deliver the WMWINDOWPOSCHANGED notification. Eventually the thread runs out of kernel stack space and SetWindowPos fails silently.p blockquote  pProposed solution is to override OnSizeChanged method for container controls like Panels or TabControl in my casep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode    protected override void OnSizeChangedEventArgs e              if this.Handle  null                      BeginInvokeMethodInvoker gt base.OnSizeChangede               codepre  pI successfully applied this solution to my case created custom TabControl inherited from plain winforms TabControl class and changed TabControl instance with my custom control instance. And problem was gone away But...p  p...When I launched Build on CCnet build machine Ive got a lot of Win32Exceptions Error creating window handle in different unit tests but what is most interesting not in place of my problematic control containing custom TabControl object unit test Error cases were different but they wasnt related to my custom control. When i reverted changes back everything was ok, build was created unit tests performed successfully.p  pIt totally confused me that applied change fixes user application workability but lead to unit tests fails when creating a build.p  pBy the way, on local machine all unit tests are performed ok in any cases with or without fix.p  pI spent a lot time on investigation of this problem and now I have only one assumption ccnet build machine performs all unit tests in one process and tests dont dispose test data gdi objects correctly on teardown since the error Error creating window handle usually happens when limit of allowed gdi object handles 10000 is reached. p  pCould you please share you professional opinion Thanks a lot in advance.p

Each time a JPEG image is detected, the script used the PYEXIV2  module to extract all EXIF, IPTC and XMP data from the image.

Canon is then added as the value in a dictionary.  for root, dirnames, filenames in os.walkCUsersXXXDesktop   for filename in fnmatch.filterfilenames, .jpg       matches.appendos.path.joinroot, filename  for entry in matches     metadata  pyexiv2.ImageMetadataentry     metadata.read     keys  metadata.exifkeys  metadata.iptckeys  metadata.xmpkeys     for key in keys         dict1[key]  metadata[key].rawvalue      print entry     print strdict1 codepre  pWhat I am looking to do is output the results to a MySQL DB. Now, my problem is that I dont have an indefinite list of the metadata headers and indeed I have struggled to locate one and so, for my table row headers, I am looking to compare each value in the dictionary key ie. date taken, make, model etc... and if it doesnt exist in the table, for it to be added to my table as a header and for the EXIF data the key value to then be entered into the respective columns. Ive had a play with MySQL through Python previously but never to compare row headers and dynamically create new ones from variables.p  pCan anybody point me in the right directionp

I am then able to use the encoder algorithm from codePDFCreatecode to repack the image as 8bit.p  pWhat Id like to do is to eliminate the memoryintensive decodeencode step. a hrefhttpforums.adobe.comthread285529 relnofollowThis threada suggests that this is possible by widening or shifting bits to make LZW codes the proper length for codeLZWDecodecode.p  pI contacted the thread author and he provided some additional details, in particular that codes for color indices remain the same but are padded with zeros e.g., code[10000]code becomes code[000010000]code, that codeltCleargtcode and codeltEndgtcode codes are changed to codelt256gtcode and codelt257gtcode respectively, and that all other codes are offset by 256  original codeltCleargtcode code.p  pHowever, he was unable to elaborate further due to restrictions by his employer. In particular, I am uncertain how to handle a code when its modified value exceeds codelt4095gtcode the maximum index for the LZW code table. I am also unsure how to repack the revised codes into a bitstream.p  pThe algorithms I am currently using are below.p  precode Read 5bit data stream  sub ReadData5       my data  shift      my csize  6                 minimium LZW code size     my tsize  33                initial code table size     my ibuff,ibits  0,0   input buffer     my obuff,obits  0,0   output buffer      my stream                  bitstream     my pos     0      SUBBLOCK while 1         my s  substrdata, pos, 1           get subblock size         my nbytes   unpackC, s or last SUBBLOCK         my cmask    1 ltlt csize  1          BYTES while 1              read csize bits             while ibits lt csize                   end of subblock                 nbytes and next SUBBLOCK                  s  substrdata, pos, 1                 my c  unpackC, s                  ibuff  c ltlt ibits                 ibits  8                            write csize bits             my code    ibuff amp cmask              my wbits  csize             ibuff  gtgt csize             ibits    csize             tsize              if obits gt 0                 obuff  code gtgt csize  8  obits                 wbits  8  obits                 stream . packC, obuff amp 0xFF                           if wbits gt 8                 wbits  8                 stream . packC, code gtgt wbits amp 0xFF                           if obits  wbits gt 0                 obuff  code ltlt 8  obits                            clear code             if code  32                 csize    6                 tsize    33                 cmask    1 ltlt csize  1                            end code             if code  33                 stream . packC, obuff amp 0xFF                 last SUBBLOCK                           if tsize  1 ltlt csize                 if csize gt 12                     csize                  else                      cmask  1 ltlt csize  1                                                   Pad with zeros to byte boundary     stream . 0 x 8  lengthstream  8      return stream      Decode 5bit data stream  sub UnLZW5      my data  shift      my csize  6                  minimium LZW code size     my tsize  33                 initial code table size     my ibuff,ibits  0,0    input buffer      my stream                   bitstream     my pos     0       initialize code table     my table   map  chr  0..tsize2     table[32]       my prefix       my suffix         get first code word     while ibits lt csize         my d      unpackC, substrdata, pos, 1         ibuff    ibuff ltlt 8  d         ibits  8           my c2      ibuff gtgt ibits  csize     ibits    csize     my cmask  1 ltlt ibits  1     ibuff   amp cmask       get remaining code words     DECOMPRESS while pos lt lengthdata         my c1  c2          while ibits lt csize             my d      unpackC, substrdata, pos, 1             ibuff    ibuff ltlt 8  d             ibits   8                   c2       ibuff gtgt ibits  csize         ibits  csize         cmask   1 ltlt ibits  1         ibuff amp cmask           clear code         if c2  32             stream  . table[c1]             table    32             csize    6             tsize    33             next DECOMPRESS                    end code         if c2  33             stream . table[c1]             last DECOMPRESS                    get prefix and suffix         prefix  table[c1] if c1 lt tsize         suffix  c2 lt tsize  substrtable[c2], 0, 1  substrprefix, 0, 1           write prefix         stream . prefix           write multiplecharacter sequence         table[tsize]  prefix . suffix           increase code size         if tsize  2  csize             if csize gt 12                 csize                                 return stream  codepre

Negative 78326 pThere are a lot of topics on the subject saying that you cannot rewrite an incoming request to a different Application Pool in IIS 7 one such post is a hrefhttpserverfault.comquestions220007iis75multipleapplicationpoolsandurlrewriting40318forbiddenhttpserverfault.comquestions220007iis75multipleapplicationpoolsandurlrewriting40318forbiddena.  A redirect will work but the requirement for this project is we cannot allow the user to see or search engines to index the redirected Url.p  pSo the question is is there any other mechanism on the local server that allows you to intercept a request before IIS has had a chance to begin the request processing somewhat like the old ISAPI filters used to do.  A lot of articles suggest using some form of a Http Proxy or Software Load Balancer both options are valid but can cause some overhead with physical and virtual resources.  To recap, the main goal is that were trying to get requests coming from www.domain.com. to be rewritten to www.domain.comcurrentversionR1 where the root Web Site and the versioned Web Application are isolated from each other.p

Negative 78326 pIm trying to overlay 2 images. The bottom image is loaded from the image library in to a UIImageView object with an alpha set to 1.0. All pixels in this image have an alpha value of 1.0 as well. The second image Im creating in a context. The alpha values vary from pixel to pixel for this image. After creating the second image in context, I then draw it to a second UIImageView displayed on top of the first UIImageView. This 2nd UIImageView also has an alpha set at 1.0. Both UIImageViews have the background property set to clear.p  pIm trying to change the individual alpha values of the pixels in the second image at runtime using a slider, however, I cant get the RGB values of the second image to blend properly with the 1st image. I dont want to blend based off of lightness, darkness, etc. It seems I want kCGBlendModeCopy, but this still seems to blend based off of lightness or some other parameter.p  pTo help visualize the problem Imagine my bottom UIImageView is a photograph of a person. My top UIImageView consists of 2 solid separated circles 1 Red and 1 Green. Using a slider, if I change the alpha values of the pixels that are Red from 0.0 to 1.0 and back, then the Red circle should fade in to solid red, and fade complete out smoothly.p  pI can verify that my alpha values are working correctly by setting the RGB data array values to equal the alpha value and setting the alpha value to 1.0. This shows a black circle fading to white and back. p  pHeres the code Im using to create the second image thats being overlaid on the first.p  precodeimage lt is the name of the second UIImageView thats passed to this method rgbaDataNew lt is the name of my pixel data array for the second image  CGContextRef context CGImageRef imageRef     CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace  CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB  context  CGBitmapContextCreatergbaDataNew, width, height, 8, 4  width, colorSpace, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast  kCGBitmapByteOrder32Big  imageRef  CGBitmapContextCreateImage context UIImage  topImage  [UIImage imageWithCGImageimageRef]  CGContextSetBlendModecontext, kCGBlendModeCopy CGContextDrawImagecontext, CGRectMake0, 0, width, height, [topImage CGImage]  image.image  [UIImage imageWithCGImageCGBitmapContextCreateImage context]  CGColorSpaceReleasecolorSpace     CGContextReleasecontext   CGImageReleaseimageRef codepre

Negative 78326 pI have been using Linux env and recently migrated to solaris. Unfortunately one of my bash scripts requires the  use of codegrepcode with the codePcode switch [ pcre support ] .As Solaris doesnt support the codepcrecode option for grep , I am obliged to find another solution to the problem.And codepcregrepcode seems to have an obvious  loop bug and  codesedcode codercode option is unsupported  I hope that using codeperlcode or codenawkcode will solve the problem on solaris.p  pI have not yet used codeperlcode in my script and am unware neither of its syntax nor the flags.p  pSince it is codepcrecode , I beleive that a codeperlcode scripter can help me out in a matter of minutes. They should match over multiple lines . p  pWhich one would be a better solution in terms of efficiency the codeawkcode  or the codeperlcode solution p  pThanks for the replies .p

Keeping an education institution in mind i created the Perimeter Tables like Main Gate, Zones, Building , Levels, Sections, Roomseach table with foreign key relation.....Now i wish to create department table and employee tables, But how can i define a department to a particular perimeter. Because as the user the department can be a room or an entire building. Giving all the perimeter table foreign Key into the department table is not an apt way i guess.

Negative 78326 pThis question is about handling arrays of information, theres are many ways I could do this, but I would like some input from programmers with more experience, I know what I want to do just not how to organize the information the best way, and objectiveC is really making me ponder this, I dont want to get 100 hours into work a decide, oops this wasted the beast way to do this. So here goes p  pI have a grid where Im simulating a playing field, each piece of the grid I call a cell. The cells have around 20 different values each, all integers, nothing fancy. A change to a cell will be either by player input, or occur or by surrounding cells through different algorithms. p  pThe changes to cells will occur once a turn is complete, so its not real time. Now, Im not even sure about doing this with a MutableArrays, a plain Array, or just a plain matrix. Arrays are good at keeping such info for one dimension, but I would imagine would become quite cumbersome if you have to address a batch of 10,000 of these cells. On the other hand a simple matrix might not be so elegant, but probably easier to work with. p  pAny insight would be greatly appreciated.    p

Negative 78326 pI have two separate newsletter databases right now. One is a simple optin where a customer can just give their email address to receive our mailings, and the other is a fullblown customer account database username, password, address, order history, etc.. Both end up getting basically the same newsletters we do some segmentation and dynamic content where possible. Additionally, I should mention that the optin table has some oneoff columns where different marketing initiatives have gathered data about the contact where the contact registered [onlineoffline] and what promotion it was apart of, their mailing address if we have it, etc..p  pIve had these two lists set up for years, but it is getting harder and harder to manage as a customer moves from a simple optin to creating an account, they update their email address, etc.. Once the user creates the account, it would make sense that theyll manage their newsletter settings from in there. But sometimes an existing customer enters their email address in the optin or vice versa and it starts getting complicated to manage the duplicates. We also have to deal with a lot of duplicate data between the two databases and going across multiple databases, not just tables, is a challenge.p  pAdding to the complications, we send our newsletter using a third party service. We have some processes that run everysooften that will do some twoway syncing, so I have to do some juggling each time to determine which database I pull changes frompush changes to, which source was updated last, etc.. If the contact is moving from the optin list to the customer list, I have to push changes, deactivate the old relationship if they added themselves to the optin and we already have their email in the other database, I set a flag to ignore them  its all a headache.p  pNow this has to be a pretty common situation. Almost every ecommerce site I go to has at least two distinct lists like this. My question is how are they handling it Whats the best practicep  pThe way I see it, I have two optionsp  ol lipUse two different tables in the same database which is pretty close to how Im doing it now. This allows me to continue to keep things separate and organized, but efficiently check both lists as the same time for conflictingduplicate information. I still have many of the same problems moving the relationship or defining a master record, duplicate data, propagating changes, etc., but it should simplify a few things at least.pli lipCreate a single table call it NewsletterContacts or something for all contacts to share. Optin users would probably be added directly, but entries from the customer account table would would have to be synced. There are a number of downsides to this too, though. Any change to the customer account table would have to be pushed to NewsletterContacts before it could be pushed to our email software. Id have some very mixed content in that database  some records would have an address and source and such, others would just have an email address, and then others would point to a customer account table that would have all types of other information.pli ol  pstrongTL,DRstrong How do you manage two separate newsletter lists when you know there will be duplicatesp

Negative 78326 pIm using oracle 11g and Im trying to find out the length of a text. I will normally use select lengthmyvar from table, but I cant do that.p  pThe table which I want to query has a BLOB column that saves characters or photos. I want to know the number of characters that have my BLOB column.p  pI tried to convert my BLOB into a char using UTLRAW.CASTTOVARCHAR2myblob from table, but this functions isntt working correctly or maybe Im making a mistake. p  pFor example My BLOB have the word Section, when I see this in the databse in the hexadecimal form I see S.e.c.t.i.o.n.. I dontk know why it have those points in between each letter. Then I used the this query p  precodeselect UTLRAW.CASTTOVARCHAR2myblob  from table codepre  pThe result of this query is S so its not the complete word that my BLOB has, and when I make this queryp  precodeselect lengthUTLRAW.CASTTOVARCHAR2myblob from table codepre  pthe result is 18 and the word Sections doesnt have 18 characters.p  pI was trying to convert the blob into a varchar, although I think my best choise would be a clob because the length of the text that it can save is more than the limit that varchar has. I tried to do that by making this query Im not sure if this is correct but is what I found in the internetp  precodeselect UTLRAW.CASTTOVARCHAR2DBMSLOB.SUBSTRmyblob, 32767, 1 from table codepre  pThis query also returns S p  pI hope you can help me with this problem. thanks for advancedp

Negative 78326 pI was wondering. I have a simple Java web project with a servlet. When no users are using it I host it local on GlassFish I still see a sawtooth pattern in the memory usage of the process. I cant seem to understand what the JVM is doing I understand the normal flow of the memory used by JVM. The heap is getting filled with objects the application is creating. At a certain point the heap reaches a point where the garbage collector comes in, which will remove all the cached objects which no longer are used, so that new objects can be created and can be filled in the heap size.p  pWhat I wonder is, what is the JVM doing all the time when its idle img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeRp2W.jpg altenter image description herep  pEDIT p  pLike I said in the comments. I created a very simple Java application in Eclipse which showed a Swing window saying hello world. When I watch the memory usage of the JVM in Java VisualVM, I see the same sawtooth pattern. p

Negative 78326 pI am currently trying to optimize the random forest classifier for a very highdimensional dataset p  200k using recursive feature elimination RFE. a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagescaretindex.html relnofollowstrongcaretstronga package has a nice implementation for doing this strongemrfeemstrongfunction. However, I am also thinking about optimizing RAM and CPU usage.. Thats why I wonder if there is an opportunity to set different larger number of trees to train the first forest without feature elimination and to use its importances to build the remaining ones with RFE using for example 500 trees with 10 or 5fold crossvalidation.

And I want to place a bootstrap search bar at the right of the entire header. Ive tried to float the search bar right, but however it gets placed right after the header text. So the image, header text and the search bar come one after the other and hence when I keep minimizing the browser window, they do not stack properly either according to bootstraps responsive layout.p  precodeltdiv classcontainergt         ltimg srchttpwww.computerclipart.comcomputerclipartimagescartooncomputerandbooks0521100430154128SMU.jpg height90 width120 gt         lth1 classlogogt Resource Directory         ltform classformsearch pullrightgt                 ltdiv classinputappendgt                         ltinput typetext classspan2 searchquerygt                         ltbutton typesubmit classbtngtSearchltbuttongt                 ltdivgt         ltformgt         lth1gt ltdivgt  ltdiv classcontainergt         ltdiv classnavbar navbarinversegt                 ltdiv classnavbarinnergt                         ltdiv classcontainer stylewidth autogt                                        lt Nav Bar Contents goes here, removed it to minimize the code gt                         ltdivgt                 ltdivgt         ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classcontainergt         ltdiv classherounitgt                 lth2gtltcentergtXYZ University  Academic Resource Directoryltcentergtlth2gt         Welcome to the Academic Resource Directory of XYZ University.

Negative 78326 pI am implementing a depth first tree traversal code a large tree. Its single traversal process can span several days because of the long processing time at each node and in between the system might crash or shutdown. p  pTherefore I want to make the whole process resumable if it the process stops in between for some reason. For that reason I am planning make the whole process backed by persistent datastore which essentially stores the state of the process. p  pAs I figured out that for depth first traversal I will need a Stack type of data structure and which can be realized through a linked list type of array implementation. So my question is if there is some datastore which provides the ability to persist large array to maintain the order of the entities to represent a stack by it. Or if there is some other way through which I can maintain the state of my traversal in a persistent storage.p  pThanks.  p

Negative 78326 pI am trying to implement a new MAC protocol based on 2011 IEEE paper where random waiting time for default MAC wireless networks 802.11 DCF to a Periodcontrolled MAC for higher performance.p  pI will explain the proposed protocol in terms of a simple scenario consider 2 transmitting nodes experiencing a collision in a network after they each have waited a random amount of time say x and y, implying they both have different backoff periods if we imply periodic backoff from there on, their backoffs will be xa, ya which goes on and will never be equal preventing them from ever colliding with each other again.p  pAlso, the period of the backoff is same for all the nodes in the network a in the above example, and any change that has to be done with this a period will also affect with all the nodes in the network. This change is based on the channel state and the period is altered following Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease procedure with respect to the channel idleness threshold set in the protocol algorithm.p  pAlthough the author of the above mentioned IEEE paper refused to help with the code, he did mention that the changes he made to implement the protocol were done in the following files  The code in these files mac802.11.cc, mactimers.cc, mac802.11.h, mactimers.h  is posted in pastebin.cap  pa hrefhttppastebin.ca2303764 relnofollowhttppastebin.ca2303764a a hrefhttppastebin.ca2303763 relnofollowhttppastebin.ca2303763a pastebin.ca2303762 pastebin.ca2303765p  pAlso the algorithm for the proposed MAC protocol is given in  pastebin.ca2303772p  pI would appreciate it if anyone could help me alter this method to change the random calculation to periodic.

In his roles before and since, this gifted actor has continued to demonstrate his remarkable talent and versatility.ltbr gtltbr gtRichard was born on January 23, 1950 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father, Stuart Anderson, taught English, drama, and humanities at a local high school, and is an accomplished jazz bassist. His mother, Jocelyn, is an artist, talented in both painting and sculpture. Richard is the eldest of four sons. He and his brothers, Jeffrey Scott, Thomas John, and James Stuart, grew up in the Minneapolis suburb of Roseville, where Richard developed early interests in sports, the arts, music, and acting.ltbr gtltbr gtLike many boys growing up in Minnesota, Richard dreamed of becoming a professional hockey player. However, at the age of 16, he broke both arms, in separate accidents three weeks apart, while playing in high school hockey games. He put aside his dreams of playing professionally, though he still harbors a deep love for the sport. Richard talks of his restlessness growing up, his early desire to explore, and his adventures hitchhiking and hopping freight trains. At the age of 17, he took a 5641 mile bicycle trip from his home in Minnesota through Canada and Alaska, an experience which was sparked by his sense of adventure and discovery, but which also gave him a more centered sense of direction.,                             autographsAutograph from Richard 50.,                             photographsPhotograph with Richard 80.

Negative 78326 pIm facing a strange problem with an app in which one the main views is a codeUIWebViewcode. This app has a login view controller codeUIKitcode only inside a navigation controller, and on successful login the main view controller is pushed, which contains a codeUIWebViewcode and some other controls. The codewebViewcode loads and displays the Kindle Cloud Reader a hrefhttpread.amazon.com relnofollowhttpread.amazon.coma.p  pThe problem happens if the app is backgroundedswitched while on the login screen when the user presses Home or during the normal Facebook login flow. In this specific case, the Kindle Reader never loads even though the UIWebView is created AFTER the login. If the app is backgrounded after the webview was already created, the problem does not occur.p  pInvestigating the issue further through Safari debugging, it seems the problem is triggered by the javascript error codeSECURITYERR DOM Exception 18 An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent.code This error is related to a codeopenDatabasecode command.p  pThis problems seems related to a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseCB330 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseCB330a. All versions from iOS 5 and forward are affected, both device and simulator.p  pAny thoughtsp
Negative 78326 pI have an app that has 2 timers starting on their button clicks.p  pWhen they start, the timer countdown shows up in a text view so the user sees the seconds counting down 10,9,8,7, etcp  pOne counter is a 45 second timer, the other a 30 second timer. I have noticed that when the timers start they act one of two ways either the timer countdown shows the seconds starting at the proper one then skips one 45, 43, 42, 41, etc or the other time it doesnt show the start value and jumps directly to 44, 43, 42, 41, etc and doesnt skip any.p  pUltimately Id like these timers to show the initial value and countdown reasonably.  I.e. always display 45 first, then 44, 43,42,41 etc.p  pAny thoughts on why this may or may not be doing it Im using the android CountDownTimer in my class.p  pstrongUpdated here is my code for my CountDownTimerstrongp  precode    public CountDown long millisInFuture, long countDownInterval, Button button       supermillisInFuture, countDownInterval     this.button  button    Timer Countdown Override public void onTicklong millisUntilFinished      long timeRemaining  millisUntilFinished1000     button.setTextmillisUntilFinished1000 codepre

Negative 78326 pI have a Ruby on Rails app running which has a database of telephone numbers. I need to run apps on 5 different phones such that they get a notification from the Rails server with a phone number this is done one after the other, not all phones get the number together. On receiving the phone number, the app checks if there is an existing call or not. If there is no call, it dials the number otherwise sends a Phone Busy status back to the Rails server. p  pI was thinking of ways to do this.

Negative 78326 pI was just having a play around with Entity Framework Code First and came to a stand still on the best way to relate a group of tables. I may be looking at this in completely the wrong way, in which case it would great if someone could point me in the right direction.p  pBasically I have 3 tables, 2 main tables and 1 which holds common fields for both tables.p  pNow, where Im stuck is on what type of relationship I should setup between the 2 main tables and the 3rd table. The two main tables will always have 11 relationships with the 3rd table, however the 3rd table will either be related to table 1 OR table 2 not both.p  pAm I possibly not looking at this in the right way and should I just get rid of the third table and just have the common fields replicated in both tablesp  pHere is what the structure of my tables look like at the mommentp  pTable 1br   Idbr   RatePricingIdbr   Namebr   CreatedOnbr   ModifiedOnp  pTable 2br   Idbr   RatePricingIdbr   Namebr   StartOnbr   EndOnbr   CreatedOnbr   ModifiedOnbr p  pTable 3 Common Fieldsbr   Idbr   Mondaybr   Tuesdaybr   Wednesdaybr   Thursdaybr   Fridaybr   Saturdaybr   Sundaybr   MinNightsbr   CheckInOutDaysbr   RateTypebr   CreatedOnbr   ModifiedOnp  pCheers,p  pTomp  pEDITp  pI originally had it setup so table 1 amp 2 had a foreign key to table 3, however the issue came when using this in entity framework, this is because the table 3 POCO object would now have an ICollection of both table 1 and table 2 when it would only really be related to one of the table objects.p

Negative 78326 pI understand that using PDO makes SQL injections virtually impossible. However, I dont have time at the moment to change all the database related code in our website. Especially since Im new at PDO, theres some learning curve involved. So I want to know what mysqlphp functions will give the same security that PDO does.p  pWill these two points be enoughp  ol liMaking sure all GET and POST data are of the type expected such as product ids should only be numerical, so I could use codeisnumericcode.li liUsing codemysqlrealescapestringcode.li ol  pOr is there anything else I should do The way the website is, is that based on codeidxcode in the query string, things might go to the database. And what I saw after the hack was that in the database, all things that can go to the database through query strings had been compromised with values like codecd etcpwdcode. p

Negative 78326 pI started along the process of trying to speed up my tests, mostly by following a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes413fasttests relnofollowthis railscastas suggestions.

Ive run the exact same suite of tests now and gotten a wide range of runtimes, from 52 seconds to almost 1m45 Again, the EXACT same tests. p  pMoreover, the general trend seems to be that if I run a test a few times in a row, the runtimes go up by 20 second intervals each time. Then if I change something small in spechelper or wait for a while I think the latter  I know this has happened when Ive made small changes to garbage collection, the times go back down. p  pMy guess is that this problem is related to garbage collection  but ideally, Im doing that more efficiently now.

Negative 78326 pI am currently stuck with a database issue where I need to manipulate data using my database inserts. I am currently doing a website with C ASP.NET on Visual studio 2012 and the database I am using is SQL Management 2008.p  pFirstly,  I currently store my System.Date into a string  and store it as a nvarchar datatype in my database. If I would like to perhaps get the latest 10 rows from for example, user x, how should I actually go about doing the SELECT statement to only get the data I specifiedp  pAnd I currently store information like Date Of Birth using the calander Ajax toolkit so the format the dates are saved in is in monthdayyear format. The data is stored into my database as a nvarchar as well. If I want to perhaps calculate the age of userx how should I calculate itp

Negative 78326 pI am writing some code for an IRC bot written in php and running on the linux cli. Im having a little trouble with my code to retrieve a websites title tag and display it using DOMDocument NodeList. Basically, on websites with two or more  tags and you would be surprised how many there actually are... I want to process for only the first title tag.

Im aware that I can just wrap an if statement around it with a variable so it only echos one time, but Im more looking at using a for statement to process a single iteration. However, when I do this, I cant access the title attribute with titlenodeValue it says its undefined, and only when i use the foreach title as theTitle can I access the values. Ive tried title[0]nodeValue and titlenodeValue0 to retrieve the first title from the list, but unfortunately to no avail.

Negative 78326 pI have the following class samplep  precodepublic class ExceptionOne  BaseException      Define the error bit the exception represents     public static int ErrorBitNumber  1234      public ExceptionOne              Do something in  the ctor       codepre  pemThere is no relevant functionality in codeBaseExceptioncode so its not necessary to show the code em p  pFurther there are other exception classes with the property called codeErrorBitNumbercode but with other values for the property codeErrorBitNumbercode. Each exception class represents an errorbitnumber  so there is always one class for one errorbitnumber.p  pAs i never know which errorbitnumber i receive emif i receive oneem i want to implement the following p  ul liGo thru each existing class which derives from codeBaseExceptioncode and look for the received error bit numberli liIf class is found, create an instance of the specific class emfill some further properties or somethingemli liThrow itli ul  pI know that this should be possible to implement by using reflection  but truly i dont know how. Further i think using the codeErrorBitNumbercode as codepublic staticcode should be the right approach. If not, feel free to correct me.p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pFor understanding We have header files which will be parsed. In this header files there are errors defined. For each error a exception class with the specific errorbitnumber will be created. So on the lowest tier in the architecture i receive an error bit number and have to throw the specific exception which represents the specific errorbitnumberp

Negative 78326 pI have 2 questions about reducing the web request to server.p  pFirst, for example my site have 2 pages and the 2 pages contain a similar picture. what I ask is that if user comes to the first page, he downloads the picture and then come to the second page, if I make the website so that the picture is shared between the 2 pages then the user no need to download the picture again p  pSecond, if I want to put the same picture but different in size on the webpage, is it better to make 2 pictures by using image software editor or using CSS to change the width and the height of the picture. p  pThank you very much for your answer.p

Negative 78326 pI basically want to have the same virtual performance I can get with a ListView control. With a ListView control you can set an ItemCount and in the LVNGETDISPINFO notification you then fill in the information for the items once they are scrolled visible.p  pNow, the virtual functionality the TreeView provides is good for very deep trees, so you would only add items once a node expands via TVNITEMEXPANDING, and TVNGETDISPINFO can be used for filling in item information once the item is scrolled visible. But what to do if you have an always expanded twolevel tree just for design matters where TVNITEMEXPANDING wouldnt be of any use and only want to add the items once they would be visible. The problem is, theres no such thing as SetItemCount or similar to already resize the tree.p  pIn my case, the filling of item information text, image, selected image isnt the expensive part, but the inserting of items all at one level is.p  pOne option would be to only insert the items which would be visible plus one invisible one, once the invisible one gets visible detected in TVNGETDISPINFO, Id insert a few more and so on. But then the scrollbar would always get smaller the more I scroll down, I think thats weird.p  pAre there any other ideas to achieve what I want except from drawing my own controlp  pThe whole tree would just look like this, pretty much a list, its just that I like the treelook.p  precodeRootNode  Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Item 6 Item 7 ...

Negative 78326 pI have a table called readings that has  76 million rows in it that Im running this query onp  precodedeclare tunnelid int  13 SELECT TOP 1 localtime, recordedtime FROM readings WHERE tunnelid  tunnelid  ORDER BY id DESC codepre  pThe id column is a bigint, set as the primary key, and has a clustered index, and there is also an index on the tunnelid field.p  pThe works great and returns in less than a second for about 16 out of the 20 different tunnelids Im trying.

Negative 78326 pThere are several techniques to download external javascript asynchronously, and there are several techniques for coupling asynchronous download with inline code to preserve execution order.p  pBut I have a couple of questions that Id be most grateful if someone with a good understanding of this area was able to answer please.p  pThe first question is more just checking that controlling the execution of inline code is as obvious as I think it is.p  pSay I have thisp  precodeinlinescript1 script I have no control over inlinescript2 my script codepre  pwhere inlinescript2 is code that I can add to a page, but inlinescript1 is not under my control please, no why not type questions to this  its just the way it is for reasons I wont bloat this post any further with.p  pSay inlinescript2 cannot be executed before [asynchronously downloaded] external script A.js has loaded. Thats fine  create a script tag with srcA.js and insert it into the document, and also change inlinescript2 to be executed on the onloadonreadystatchange of A.js. So I now havep  precodeinlinescript1 create script element set the scripts src attribute set the scripts onloadonreadystatechange handlers to functions that call a function in A.js  Afunc1 dynamically add script to page codepre  pNow when the asynchronous download of A.js is finished, Afunc1 will be called.p  pBut if I want to ensure that inlinescript1 has run before inlinescript2, then is that guaranteed just from the order in the page Do all browsers parse the page in a strict top to bottom way, therefore guaranteeing that inlinescript1 will be executed before the call to the function Afunc1 p  pThe second question is how to include more than one block of inline code on a page. For examplep  precodeinlinescript1 script I have no control over inlinescript2 my script inlinescript3 script I have no control over inlinescript4 my script codepre  pI cant really employ the same strategy as in the first question because Id imagine I would not want to reference the external script twice as it may then be downloaded ignore caching and executed twice.p  precodeinlinescript1  function      create script element     set the scripts src attribute     set the scripts onloadonreadystatechange handlers to functions that call a function in A.js  Afunc1     dynamically add script to page   inlinescript3  inlinescript4 ltnot sure what to do heregt codepre  pI cant just call functions in A.js above as I dont know it has loaded yet. I dont really want to add a script onload handler at that point either because it means polluting the global namespace and there is no guarantee that I wouldnt miss the event being fired anyway depending on how long inlinescript3 takes. And I cant really repeat the anonymous function block again for the reasons already mentioned.p  pAlso, inlinescript3 may get run before the call to Afunc1p  pIs there any way to preserve execution order in this case Im wondering if I can maybe make use of the new async attribute If I set the async attribute to false in the created script element in the anonymous function, and leave the inlinescript4 as inline code but also add the async with value false attribute, might that work p  pThanks,p  pPaulp

Negative 78326 pI have an assignment to convert a large set of videos into ogg, webm and mp4, for different resolutions plus mobile etc, I am considering running transcoding job queues using ffmpeg or use elastic transcoder. strongBackground infostrong the source files are already on S3 and the web application is quite integrated into AWS SDK, and files get added daily, real time conversion not requiredp  pI know using EC2 and ffmpeg will involve some dev time and effort, as opposed to just using the transcorder API. But if there is good cost saving...p  pTherefore I have two questions p  p1 AWS say charge is roughly .015minute of videoSD. My question is, is each output file charged separately. Docs say they support up to 30 outputs for the same job. But it not clear whether it is per minute of the job or per minute of each output format 0.45minute of video for 30 output formats then p  p2 Does any one have experience using EC2 and ffmpeg in this use case Is this cheaper than transcorderp  pLast time I developed something of this nature, I did not factor in the IO costs for EC2 and IO ended up costing more than instance itself.

Negative 78326 pI am developing an app for Android Api 15 and above.p  pI have been using a custom codeCursorAdaptercode implementation with a codeListViewcode for some time now. I was under the impression that even with many thousands of rows records the codeListViewcode would handle the performance side of things. p  pMy phone, a Sony Xperia U, has a hard time scrolling beyond 10  20 rows. The first few rows scroll nicely and then I hit a wall of stuttering and the device becoming unresponsive A total of 70 rows all together. It is running Android 4.0.4. Other phones such as the Samsung S3 and Sony Xperia Z perform much better, but at what point is this going to degrade. These 2 phones are running 4.1. I am getting the codeCursorWindowcode warning seen below on the Xperia U.p  pI have implemented all the tricks in the trade, codeViewHoldercode pattern etc, and all images are loaded inside codeAsyncTaskcodes.p  pAnyway, the trouble I am having regarding performance does not lie inside the codeBindViewcode. The codeBindViewcode method completes quite quickly  within 13 milliseconds.p  pThe problem I believe lies with the codeCursorWindowcode.

Negative 78326 pI am creating a report on SSRS 2008 R2.  This report will only be sent when the data exists. At first, I tried to create datadriven subscription calling the stored procedure that checks if the view has data. If so, it will send the report to the defined recipients.  Since the users ask to check the view every 10 mins, I set up a job to execute the job name of this datadriven subscription on SQL Server Agent. But I found out the subscription always timed out even though it only take around twenty to thirty seconds to select the view directly.  p  pThen I tried to think other way to fulfill this requirement. p  pThe way I tried is to create a stored procedure on SQL Server to check if the view has data first.  If so, it will run the job name of the subscription created for the report on SSRS 2008 R2. In order to check the view every 10 mins, I created a job to execute this SP every 10 mins on SQL Server Angent. p  pThe question is why it takes about 20 mins to execute SP1 with IF EXISTS but only 20 seconds to execute SP2 with COUNT.

The severity of this effect depends on the size and shape of the viewport, so Im guessing trying to figure out the math involved for image size, aspect ratio or the defined scroll ratios isnt worth it.

Removing codebackgroundsize covercode seems to improve things somewhat, but not enough would using codeimgcode elements improve the performance over background images Its a huge change and a messy way of doing it, but it would be worth it if it fixes the laggy scrolling.li ol  pThanks in advancep

Negative 78326 pIm really enjoying Marionette and the structure it adds to Backbone. However, Im a little stumped with how to reuse a Module on a single page.p  pI have a Marionette Module that renders and handles events for a category tree. I would like to reuse this Module on the same page, that would display different collections in different regions in the page. I came to realize that the Marionette Modules are essentially singletons on the Application object, which is also a singleton. I apparently cant create a new instance of a Module to display and handle events for a new collection in a different region. Likewise, I cant register and trigger events on the Module, because there is only one and the events triggered in each region would need to be independent of each other.p  pAm I thinking about Modules incorrectly How can they reused on the same page with different regions  collectionsp

Negative 78326 pIve used MAMP for two years and am always upset with it forcing me to type in password every time I restart my Macintosh and log in again.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions207786stoppasswordpromptonmampstartupthis posta here at Stack Overflow, but no answer there made me satisfied and the post itself is a bit outdated and hence some of links there are already gone, let me post the question again.p  pOne, I dont like to change permissions of my codetmpcode and its subdirectories to  codeawcode, as suggested in one of the answers on the above link.p  pSecond, I have no knowledge in creating AppleScript and dont like the idea of devoting large amount of time to just solve the issue here. Also, it looks like I have to type in my password in plain text there, which I hope to eschew if I can.p  pThree, I dont like to use the thirdparty application if it involves huge security caution and is NOT provided within Mac App Store, which it is in this case.p  pSo are there any other solutions to this issue Or if I download MySQL directly I mean, not using MAMP, can I set it such that it doesnt force me to type in password whenever I log inp  pFor your information, I downloaded MySQL and MongoDB in Ubuntu a few months ago, and I was quite fascinated to see daemons already running without any explicit actions by users whenever I restart and log in to the system. Can I achieve the same in OS X too That is exactly what Im longing for...p  pThanks.p

Negative 78326 pI would like to implement an HTML5 animation that involves a bit more than just moving an item from point A to point B.

Negative 78326 pI have a document that I have built tables of data into that are formula driven. I created charts for these tables and for reporting purposes applied filters to these tables to make the charts more readable. The way this works is the user selects an option from an ActiveX combo box which triggers the filter on the table thus making the chart only display the filtered values. All of this works very well except when I add more data in the form of new row or columns to my table. The result is when you select an option from the combo box the chart just appears blank. This only happens sometimes and I have yet to figure out why. The attached picture is showing what the charts data looks like when I chose select data after this problem occurs. As you can see there is data that should be displayed in the dialogue box but it appears empty, likewise the chart is empty. If I copy and paste the chart the data then appears in the new chart, until I select a different option from the combo box, then it disappears again. Very confusing and frustrating. Any ideas as to why this is occurringp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgaT5N.png altenter image description herep

Negative 78326 pIm trying to build a script that will remove DOM elements and add them back in their original places. I did some research and found a code snippet that looks like it should work. The only issue Im having is that the global variables codeLOelemsRemovedcode and codeLIelemsRemovedcode are not retaining the values they get inside the code.eachcode anonymous function. The code is as follows p  precodevar LOelemsRemoved  [] var LIelemsRemoved  []  function switchContent      if loggedIn          .loggedout.eachfunction i, o              elem  o             window.LOelemsRemoved.push                 loc elem.prev,                 obj elem.detach                          alertLOelemsRemoved.length returns the correct values for each iteration             alertremoved LO elems             window.LOelemsRemoved  LOelemsRemoved                  alertLIelemsRemoved.length outputs 0         while LIelemsRemoved.length              elem  elemsRemoved.pop             elem.loc.afterelem.obj             alertadded LI elems               else          .loggedin.eachfunction i, o              elem  o             window.LIelemsRemoved.push                 loc elem.prev,                 obj elem.detach                          alertLIelemsRemoved.length returns the correct values for each iteration             alertremoved li elems             window.LIelemsRemoved  LIelemsRemoved                  alertLOelemsRemoved.length outputs 0         while LOelemsRemoved.length              elem  elemsRemoved.pop             elem.loc.afterelem.obj             alertadded LOEleems                codepre  pAs you can see, both of the variables are declared outside of codeswitchContentcode. The 4 commented lines show which codealertcode statements return which values. The ones inside the code.eachcode statements return the values they should. However, once the code.eachcode statement finishes execution, codeLOelemsRemovedcode and codeLIelemsRemovedcode both have length code0code. Im guessing this is a scope issue because Im using anonymous functions but Im not extremely advanced with javascript so Im not exactly sure what the scope issue is. Thanksp

Currently Transmit FTP handles this as a sync function and only downloads files where the remote file date is newer than the local file.  It also will remove any local files that dont exist on the remote server.p  p3 Create a compressed archive of the files from step 2, named as websiteCURRENTDATEp  p4 Move archive from step 3 to a specific folder and delete any file in this specific folder thats older than 120 Days.p  pRight now I dont know how to do step 1, or the synchronization in step 2 I see how I can use wget to download the whole site, but that seems as though it will download everything each time it runs, even if its not been changed.p  pSteps 3 and 4 are probably easy to find via searching, but I havent searched for that yet since I cant get past step 1.p  pThanksp  pAlso FYI my webhost doesnt do these types of backups, so thats why I like to do my own.p

Currently I am able to only select from 10th June I think this must be because of the minDate setting but how do i stop this from changing every day Thank you for any help.p  pCode as followsp  precode    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction      datepicker.datepickerminDate 129, maxDate 5Y, changeMonth true,changeYear true, showButtonPanel true, dateFormat dd MM yy           form.onsubmit, function     return email.val  emailConfirmation.val      ltscriptgt codepre

The result is that codeprofessionalsproscode have slipped through the net. But I dont know how to pull that off within the list comprehension. p  pSo my question is Is this possible with the list comprehension. p

Negative 78326 pI would like to merge polygon data and raster data into one dataframe for purposes of then using randomForests package in R.br This involves first extracting the mean raster value per polygon.  p  pSo far, I have the following  p  precodeload libraries libraryraster libraryrgdal librarysp librarymaptools  import raster data  r lt rastermyRasterdata.tif  import polygon data  p lt readShapePolymyPolydata.shp  extract mean raster value for each polygon ExtractMyData lt extractr, p, smallTRUE, funmean, na.rmTRUE, dfFALSE,  nl1, spTRUE  note I have also tried this with dfTRUE and spFALSE codepre  pThe output is a matrix, which I can write to a dataframe.

Negative 78326 pI will state up front that this is a well discussed topic however I have been unable to find the answer I need.  I have created a winforms app that makes WCF calls to a server.  All works fine with no http proxy as well as an http proxy present nonauthenticating.  I did no extra coding to achieve this since many problems with proxies were fixed after .NET 1.1. It just works by accepting the Internet Options from IE.  This is my primary goal.  I want the proxy config to just work including authentication.  Right now, proxy with auth fails.  I do not  want to programatically specify credentials, server names, port, etc... It was pointed out here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions299940howshouldisetthedefaultproxytousedefaultcredentialsHow should I set the default proxy to use default credentialsa that the following entry is neededp  precodeltsystem.netgt ltdefaultProxy useDefaultCredentialstrue gt ltsystem.netgt codepre  pIve got this in my app.config but not having success.

I know how to do this and I can get it to work but thats not the point.  I would like all settings to be discovered including my current credentials I used to authenticate with windows.  The following has an interesting answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions933104webservicecallsandproxyauthenticationintherealworldWeb service calls and proxy authentication in the real worlda.  It states that if IE had to prompt for username and password then so would my application.  In fact, IE DOES prompt for username and password.

Negative 78326 pAt the project Im on were using SVGs for icons. Most of our icons need to have a second version where the color is inverted as in a blue icon for white background and a white icon for blue background.p  pWere including the icons using codebackgroundimagecode in CSS.p  pI am trying to figure out if there is a way we can have only one file for each icon, and use CSS or Javascript to change its color. That would let us get away with fewer requests.p  pNow, I know that using CSS to set properties on an eminlineem SVG image works, but I dont really want to inline every icon weve got.p  pIs there a way to do thisp  pI have a a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditw1psyoeqvNGILi9pUq27ppreview relnofollowPlunkera where an SVG is included in three different ways. Inline, CSS background and the codeimgcode tag. Theres a CSS rule that sets the codefillcode attribute and that only hits the inlined SVG. Theres also a little Javascript snippet that tries to find all the circles and color them. Interestingly enough, setting codefillcode directly on the inlined SVG does not work when codefillcode is already set via CSS.p  pIt seems that codedocument.querySelectorAllcode will only find the inlined SVG, which I guess makes sense. The other two are strictly speaking not part of the DOM.p  pNow, is there any way I can override the codefillcode of the last two circles without making changes in the codecircle.svgcode file Is there some other trick I can use to display the codecircle.svgcode file with two different colorsp

Negative 78326 pIm trying to wrap the apache avrotools avrotools1.7.5.jar concat utility to do globbing properly as written, all files to be concatenated need to be written out fully. This utility is needed because a regular codecatcode or in my case codehadoop fs catcode operation will produce data with headers in the middle and cause errors in avro parsing utilities. I wrote a simple shell script named codecatavro.shcodep  precodeavrohdfshadoop jar pathtojaravrotools1.7.5.jar DIRShadoop fs ls 1  egrep .avro  awk print 8 echo avrohdfs concat DIRS    dash  tells utility to print to stdout codepre  pThis does stuff, but if I run codebash catavro.sh [path to avro data on hdfs] gt tmp.avrocode the result is a corrupted avro file. Errors get thrown when trying to read the schema, or do anything else. If I replace the last line in the shell script withp  precodeecho avrohdfs concat DIRS  codepre  pto print the command only, and then run the resulting command on my terminal, storing the result into the same tmp.avro file, things work nicely. The filesize of tmp.avro is a bit bigger.p  pIm pretty sure that the codeechocode command is to blame here, it appears to be corrupting the binary data resulting from the avrotools concat unitlity. Replacing the last line of the sh file withp  precodeavrohdfs concat DIRS  gt tmp.avro codepre  pyields the same successful result as returning the command and running it in the terminal. However, though I can write to files, it would be much better for me if I could return this to codestdoutcode so that it can be piped into a filtering utility I have.p  pWhat are the alternatives to codeechocode I have tried replacing the last line in the script with all of the following without successp  precodeecho E avrohdfs concat DIRS  avrohdfs concat DIRS  avrohdfs concat DIRS  cat avrohdfs concat DIRS  trap avrohdfs concat DIRS  0 sort of works, but data misses the gttmp.avro and spits into the termal codepre  pI have checked the PATH variable, it is the same in my terminal and in the shell script.

Negative 78326 pIm using V4 of the Google Analytics Library as provided by Google Play services. Long story short I find passing a reference to the tracker to all the components my application to be quite tedious. I know in previous versions of the library a Singleton for managing one instance was provided EasyTracker but no longer.p  pWould anyone know what the detriments are to putting a tracker in a singleton once the application startsp

Negative 78326 pI am making a game on python and tkinter, and I would like to save the highscores of the game. I have an entry wich takes the name of the player and assign it to a global Name1 and a global Score1 in wich the score is saved.p  pThe thing is that I need a file that stores the best 10 highscores, obviously showing them from the biggest score to the lowest.p  pMy question is How do I make that p  pHow can I save the Name and the Score to the file How can I save the scores with an order Including the name asociated to the scorep  pI am really confused using the methods of .readline and .write and .seek and all of those.p  pEDIT p  pI need something like thisp  pThe globals are Name1, Wich lets say is John And Score1, Wich at the end of the game will have an int object.p  pSo after a few games, John achieved 3000 on the score, and then 3500, and then 2000.p  pThe highscores file should look likep  pJohn 3500p  pJohn 3000p  pJohn 2000p  pAnd if Mike comes out and play and achieve a 3200 score, the file should look like thisp  pJohn 3500p  pMike 3200p  pJohn 3000p  pJohn 2000p  pThe max amount of players on the highscore must be ten. So if there are already ten Highscores saved, and a bigger one comes out, the lowest score must be althought ignored or deleted. I need the file because I need to do the display on a Tkinter window p  pPD Excuse my weird english Thank youp

Negative 78326 pIn Rails, is it possible to send a response back to the browser in two parts The first part doesnt need to be anything specific reason explained below.  The second part of the response would be the full normal response such as a view in .html.erb format.p  pThe reason that Im looking to do this is that Heroku requires a response to be sent back to the browser within 30 seconds, however its taking longer than 30 seconds for my app to perform several dozen calculations on 1.2 million records.p  pThe Heroku documentation indicates that this may be possible with some platforms but is it possible with Rails a hrefhttpsdevcenter.heroku.comarticleslimits relnofollowhttpsdevcenter.heroku.comarticleslimitsap  blockquote   pHTTP requests have an initial 30 second window in which the web   process must return response data either the completed response or   some amount of response data to indicate that the process is active.   Processes that do not send response data within the initial 30second   window will see an H12 error in their logs.p blockquote  pP.S. I recognize that there may be better platforms than Rails to build this kind of dataintensive app, but Im building it in Rails because thats what I know.p  pThanksp

Negative 78326 pI was looking for long time around to have portable robust solution for multiprocessing synchronization. Who touche this things know that good solution are boostiterprocess named sync objects. But .... When your process have namedmutex locked and your process die there are many normal situations when process die, not just bug or others. In that case namedmutex will remain in locked state. There were attempt to make robustmutex in boost code done by strongemIon Gaztanagaemstrong www.boost.orgdoclibs1550boostinterprocessdetailrobustemulation.hpp p  pHe had nice idea how resolve abandoning state check. Each process in game has its own lock file and while is alive it hold that file locked. Then Ions robustmutex check, in case of failed lock attempt, current owner process lock file, and can determine if current mutex owner is alive or not. In case it is death mutex can be taken. Trick with file lock is nice idea cause file locks are unlocked by OS in case process die, and this seems to be well portable. This solution wraps base spinmutex and hold current owner process id in internal field. I made intensive testing and found 2 big problems.p  ol lipFile lock handling and way how is implemented slows down mutex in manner that it is faster just use file lock.pli lipDecoupling effective lock gate variable and owner process id cause situations where mutex can be stolen by different processes.pli ol  pAnd here come my question  Im proposing solution for both problems, and I wood like to have some pro opinion about it. p  ol lipdo not use for each existing process separate lock file but to use one file for all eventual process id there should be enough 4MB and for each process lock just one byte. Position of that byte is determined by process id itself. this is not my idea but I found it in code of a hrefhttpsymas.commdb relnofollowHoward Chu and his excellent LMDBapli lipdo not wrap spinmutex as is, but rewrite its code so it use as lock gate current owner process id instead just 01,  so lock and unlock can happen in one atomic CAS operation.pli ol  pI did a try to implement it and tested on windows. I use original boost code and call boost where necessary. a hrefftpftp.3di.it3dirobustmutex.zip relnofollowHere is codea. Its taken from our projects tree, so if you want to test it you have to adapt some include maybe. Its proposal, so please do not blame me for code style or something else. If idea and mode is good, Ill continue to make it more perfect. If not Ill just use something else, but I cant find anything else.p  pThere are also versions for recursivemutex, and namedmutex too. Then there is sort of  fixing proposal, cause if one process take in owner ship precedentaly abandoned mutex, there is high probability that there must be done some sort of integrity check.p  pId like to discuss eventual improvementsp  pThank you in advancep  pLadislav.p

Negative 78326 pIm creating an app that has to store historical financial data for various stocks.

Negative 78326 pI am trying to write Java code to receive data from a streaming HTTP connection I would like to debug a problem I have with running Sockjs XHRstreaming against a springwebsocket server.p  pI use some really simple code to connectp  precode    URI uri   The server     Socket socket  new Socket     socket.connectnew InetSocketAddressuri.getHost, uri.getPort     OutputStream os  socket.getOutputStream     PrintWriter pw  new PrintWriteros     int id  new Random.nextInt  100000     pw.printlnPOST socket  id  xxxxhrstreaming HTTP1.1     pw.printlnContentType applicationstomp     pw.printlnContentLength 0     pw.printlnConnection keepalive     pw.println     pw.flush     InputStream is  socket.getInputStream     ByteArrayOutputStream baos  new ByteArrayOutputStream     byte[] buffer  new byte[8192]     int bytes     do          bytes  is.readbuffer         if bytes gt 0              System.out.printlnread  bytes             System.out.printnew Stringbuffer, 0, bytes             System.out.println               while bytes gt 0 codepre  pbut when I run it I only get the HTTP headers.p  pThat would not be too surprising in itself. I would suspect that the server did not send the contents properly.p  pBut when I monitor the traffic using Wireshark, I can see that I receive three TCP segments in response to my POST. One containing 1460 bytes 54 bytes TCPIP headers, one of 1178 bytes 54 bytes header and one of 7 bytes 44 bytes header.p  pThe first one contains the HTTP headers as well as 878 bytes of the contents Sockjs XHR streaming starts with sending a preamble of 2048 hs. The next one contains the rest of the preamble and the final one contains the open frame. Exactly as I would expect from the server.p  pWhy do my Java code not receive the remaining data When I use a raw Socket it should be completely unaware of the HTTP protocol, so I do not understand why I receive only the HTTP headers. The server probably flushes the data after writing the headers, but I can see in the networkdump that both the headers and the first part of the data is contained in the first TCP segment.p  pHere is a dump of the first received TCP segmentp  precode0000   e8 39 35 45 20 df 00 0c 29 09 62 3b 08 00 45 00  .95E ....b..E. 0010   05 dc 0c 5e 40 00 80 06 5b 27 c0 a8 06 26 c0 a8  ......[...amp.. 0020

It shows the nested datagrid, a hidden field and the filename shown as a link.

To better explain myself, heres a basic data flow of my idea.  p  p1 Chart Display Page shows default chartbr 2 Button click sends POST to testjson.phpbr 3 TestJson.php GETs button value, if statement to determines new JSON data to encodebr 4 Chart display page updates with new data  p  pHere is my current working code  p  h2options.php displays charth2  precode        ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                          Load the Visualization API and the piechart package.                         google.loadvisualization, 1, packages[corechart]                          Set a callback to run when the Google Visualization API is loaded.                         google.setOnLoadCallbackdailyChart                          function dailyChart                            var DailyRegs  .ajax                               url ltphp echo gettemplatedirectoryuri gtjsontestjson.php,                               dataTypejson,                               async false                               .responseText                            var MonthlyRegs  .ajax                               url ltphp echo gettemplatedirectoryuri gtjsontestjson1.php,                               dataTypejson,                               async false                               .responseText                             Create our data table out of JSON data loaded from server.                           var data  new google.visualization.DataTableDailyRegs                          .dailyregistrationsswitch.clickfunction e                              .dailyregistrationsswitch.addClassanalyticsbuttonselected                             .monthlyregistrationsswitch.removeClassanalyticsbuttonselected  Add class failed to results div                          var data  new google.visualization.DataTableDailyRegs                             e.preventDefault                         var chart  new google.visualization.ColumnChartdocument.getElementByIdchartdiv                         chart.drawdata, chartArealeft0,top50,width50,height75,dataOpacity .5,legendright,                                                   .monthlyregistrationsswitch.clickfunction e                             .dailyregistrationsswitch.removeClassanalyticsbuttonselected                             .monthlyregistrationsswitch.addClassanalyticsbuttonselected  Add class failed to results div                          var data  new google.visualization.DataTableMonthlyRegs                             e.preventDefault                         var chart  new google.visualization.ColumnChartdocument.getElementByIdchartdiv                         chart.drawdata, chartArealeft0,top50,width50,height75,dataOpacity .5,legendright,                                                     var chart  new google.visualization.ColumnChartdocument.getElementByIdchartdiv                           chart.drawdata, chartArealeft0,top50,width50,height75,dataOpacity .5,legendright,                               ltscriptgt  ltdiv classwrapgt     ltdiv idchartcontainergt         ltbutton iduseranalyticsjsonbutton classdailyregistrationsswitch analyticsbuttonselected valuedaily typesubmitgtDaily Analyticsltbuttongt         ltbutton iduseranalyticsjsonbutton classmonthlyregistrationsswitch valuedaily typesubmitgtMonthly Analyticsltbuttongt         ltdiv classcharttitlegtltp classchartheadergttest titleltpgtltdivgt         ltdiv idchartdiv stylewidth100 height300pxgt     ltdivgt   codepre  h2testjson.phph2  precodeltphp  mysqlimysqliconnectlocalhost,root,,wpdev  Check connection if mysqliconnecterrno  echo Failed to connect to MySQL  . mysqliconnecterror  query  SELECT DISTINCT dateuserregistered as date, count as cnt  FROM wpusers  WHERE dateuserregistered BETWEEN DATESUBdateNOW, INTERVAL 2 month AND dateNOW GROUP BY dateuserregistered   result  mysqliquerymysqli,query or die    Tables Array     daystable  array     daystable[cols]  array     arrayid gt , label gt Date, pattern gt , type gt string,     arrayid gt , label gt Registrations, pattern gt , type gt number           rows  array     while nt  resultgtfetchassoc          temp  array     temp[]  arrayv gt newdate .  . nt[cnt] . , f gtNULL     temp[]  arrayv gt nt[cnt], f gtNULL     rows[]  arrayc gt temp      daystable[rows]  rows mysqliclosemysqli       print jsonencodedaystable gt codepre

Negative 78326 pWe use JIRA to track our tasks.p  pWe add specific fixVersion for UAT and PROD to make it clear when a particular JIRA change isto be released to UAT and PROD. p  pQuestion is for changes that are only applicable to UAT environment something that we do by updating UAT specific configs, should we not track the JIRA change till Prod release My view is that even though it is UAT only change, the prod build still contains this JIRA and so for traceability sake, we should have a Prod fixVersion too. Besides, by defining a rule that every JIRA task should have UAT and PROD ifxVersion is more easier than trying to determine whether a JIRA having no PROD fixVersion is actually a UAT specific change or case where someone forgot to put a PROD fixVersion.p  pSo how do you track UAT only changes do you include such changes in your PROD release planning meetingsp

Negative 78326 pI have a few TextViews that have onClickListener set to them. It is done in the most simple and basic way. It works, but its not sensitive enough.

The TextViews are big about half the screens width wide and the same height. I thought it might be a hardware limitation, but I have a few apps on my android with great clickable buttons.

Negative 78326 pFollowing the most famous tutorials about scaffolding template modifications a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18199458customscaffoldingtemplatesinvisualstudio2013as showed by this questiona, I was able to generate custom templates, but something caught my eye.p  pThe templates stored at emCProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0Common7IDEExtensionsMicrosoftWebMvcScaffoldingTemplatesem are quite different from the default templates. For instance, the default template of Visual Studio begins a View writing something like thisp  precode     ViewBag.Title  Create   lth2gtCreatelth2gt codepre  pMeanwhile, the template stored at VS folder generates a View like thisp  precode     Layout  null   ltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth gt     lttitlegtIndexlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ... codepre  pApparently, the rest of the template is correct.p  pMy question is is there another set of template files that accept an application layout Or the files Ive copied from VS templates folder should be modified to accept my layoutp

I have managed to do this so farp  pIn codeshortcut.cppcode added this on line 102p  precode TEXTAE, VKAE, codepre  pIn codekeys.hcode I have assigned the key with the hexidecimal on line 117p  precodedefine VKAE             0xc6 codepre  pWhen I compile the code and run it, I am able to see the changes in shortcut manager and I can change the shortcut to codeVKAEcode but it makes no difference in the editor and the key  still does nothing. p  pI have been looking into codeWinUser.hcode as well but Im unsure if any changes to this file should make any difference. Any help or suggestions are appreciated. p  pThanks in advance.p  pPeterp
Negative 78326 pI am having problem when I tried to update the data from the database in this ASP.NET C project.p  pWhen in debugging mode of the database page Database.aspx, I try to update the details by modifying the fields in the EditItem template. But then, when I click Update, the data cannot be updated and shows the error message Data could not be updated. Please try again.p  pThe system thinks that all the changed details have become NULLS. Is there a problem in protected void SqlDataSource2Updated inside the codebehind of the database page Database.aspx.csp  pDatabase.aspxp  precodeltdivgt     ltaspGridView IDApplicantTableGrid

Negative 78326 pWhile analyzing a colleagues Java 7 code from a few years ago, I found that he implemented a utility for traversing data, potentially in parallel. He called it codeRangecode, and it extended the codeIteratorcode interface. Some of its new methods were awkwardly familiarp  ul licodeint sizecode would give the exact size of the range li licodeRange splitcode would separate the range into 2 pieces, preferably, although not necessarily, similar in size modifying the current range and creating a new oneli licodeRange[] splitint ncode would separate the range into N subranges, potentially attempting to make them as even as possible.li liAlthough codevoid removecode was there from codeIteratorcode, its subtypes were merely throwing codeUnsupportedOperationExceptioncode.li ul  pWhat I said to myself was that this is definitely what we can now do with subsized spliterators, thus taking advantage of the stream API. However, the spliterator in Java 8 does not provide an easy approach to splitting into codencode parts.p  pWith a recursive function, we can split it up to coden  2Lcode parts with codeLcode recursion levels, but the approach is not as trivial when codencode is not a power of two, not to mention that it feels unnatural to keep a utility function just for the effect. p  pOne might also say to simply avoid messing around with spliterators and let a stream do the splitting induced by forks during the actual processing, but the ForkJoin strategy might not be very adequate for the task, and does not guarantee that it will use the number of threads that we specifically wish to dedicate to the job. There could be cases of heavy tasks being performed on a small number of elements, in fact.p  pThe question sums up to the following having a spliterator with at least the characteristics SIZED and SUBSIZED, how can I split it into an exact number of spliteratorsp
Negative 78326 pOne of the often mentioned advantages of annotations is the ability to generate documentation, XML, config files, and more with compiledeploymenttime annotation processors. Ive seen several examples of annotation processors, but not about automatically generating docs or XMLs with them. I can see why thatd be useful, e.g. adding valuable information to a projects documentation from the annotations.p  pOne way to include them in the documentation is to use the codeDocumentedcode metaannotation on annotation types to include them in the JavaDoc, but it merely copies the annotation with its values as it is, without changing, formatting or generating anything.p  pSo, my question is How can processors be used to generate documentation, config, XML files for a project, and what are some practical examples of this p

Negative 78326 pWe use a graphing system that uses SNMP to retrieve data to graph with on every five minute mark. For example, 1200, 1205, 1210, and so on. We retrieve the graph as an image. The problem is that the browser likes to use the cached image, and we cannot get a new image until we delete the cache. What I am trying to do is generate a random tag to append to the image that makes it unique, therefore not using the cached image. We were able to generate a random tag every time the image was retrieved, but this led to a lot of server utilization from all the requests and slower response times. What I am attempting to do now is generate a new tag ONLY if p  pa it has been greater than four minutes 5 since the user retrieved an image because a five minute mark would have had to pass, p  pb it has been less than five minutes since an image was retrieved, but a five minute mark has passed since the last time an image was retrieved. For example, a if a person retrieves an image at 1204, he or she wont be able to get a new one until five minutes later with the first test, but the second test will recognize that 1205 passed if he or she attempts to retrieve an image at 1206. p  pWhat I tried to do was use a cookie and set the cookie to the new tag every time a new tag was generated. On page load it would load RandomTag variable with the value of the cookie. Onclick it would be determined if five minutes has passed since the time in the RandomTag variable or if a five minute mark has past since the last generation of a tag, generate a new tag if it has, and set cookie with new tag otherwise the tag would go unchanged.p  pCould anyone check this and see if there are any problems I tried this code, and it made my page hang.

Negative 78326 pAs we know, architecture should be separated to layers such View layer, DB layer, etc.p  pEach part should be independent from other and can be replaced without changing other layers. For example, we have a standard ASP.NET MVC application with MS SQL as database. This application uses Entity Framework. So, we have a special classes for View  View Classes. p  pThese classes manage displaying and getting information from frontend. Also, we have model classes, which includes LINQ requests to Entity Framework generated classes EF Model, updating, inserting methods etc. And we have thick controllers, where we just validate data from frontend and call methods from model classes. p  pIn this place I have qualm... Are model classes necessary or not p  pIf we dont use Entity Framework then of course, we need this layer because we cant write SQL requests directly in controller otherwise we do our controllers depend on logical DB schema, but we use Entity Framework and Entity Framework is already conceptual model p  pIt means, that we should convert logical DB structure Schema of DB to our conceptual models.

There is a GET to return the view and a POST to take the form data from the application and process itp  precodepublic ActionResult Applystring jobReference     Apply form  new Apply    Session[Settings.JOBREFERENCE]  jobReference    return Viewform   [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public ActionResult ApplyApply form      if ModelState.IsValid            codepre  pWhen I press the  to submit the form, it calls the GET controller instead of the the POST controller, despite it having [HttpPost] on the latter.p  pIf I actively renamed the HTTPPost controller and navigate to it, I see a Server Error, with a message saying it cannot be found. Submitting the form causes the page to crash.p  pstrongForm Codestrongp  precode    model Salt.Models.Apply ltdiv classapplyForRoleExt popupBoxgt     lta href classclosePopupgtltimg srcimgclosePopup.png altclose gtltagt     ltdiv classinnerContainergt         using Html.BeginFormApply, Form, FormMethod.Post, new  enctype  multipartformdata, id  ApplyForm                       Html.AntiForgeryToken             lth6gtApply for this rolelth6gt             ltdiv classhaveAccountgt                     ltspangtHave an account Apply quickly by logging in nowltspangt                     lta href classloginApplygtLogin to my accountltagt                 ltdivgt             ltdiv classleftColgt                 ltlabelgtNameltspangtltspangtltlabelgt                 ltdiv classinputBoxgt                     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.Name                 ltdivgt                 ltlabelgtEmail Addressltspangtltspangtltlabelgt                 ltdiv classinputBoxgt                     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.EmailAddress                 ltdivgt                 ltlabelgtTelephone Numberltspangtltspangtltlabelgt                 ltdiv classinputBoxgt                     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.TelephoneNumber                 ltdivgt                 ltlabelgtPortfolio Linkltspangtltspangtltlabelgt                 ltdiv classinputBoxgt                     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.PortfolioLink                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classrightColgt                 ltlabelgtCV Uploadltlabelgt                 ltdiv classinputBoxgt                     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.CV, new  type  file                  ltdivgt                 ltlabelgtCovering Noteltlabelgt                 ltdiv classinputAreagt                     Html.TextAreaForm gt m.CoveringNote                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classactionsgt                 ltp classtermsgtBy submitting this form you consent to Salt Recruitment processing your personal data in accordance with our privacy policy and agree to future contact material.ltpgt                 ltltbutton classsubmitgtApply Nowltbuttongtgt                 ltinput typesubmit namesubmit valueApply Now gt             ltdivgt              ltdivgt ltdivgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction           .validator.unobtrusive.parseApplyForm      ltscriptgt codepre  pThanks, Mike.p
Negative 78326 pI experiment with HarpJS, a NodeJS static blog generator. In tutorials there is such example for metadatap  precodefor article, slug in public.articles.data  ahrefarticles slug    h2 article.title codepre  pand codedata.jsoncode filep  precode  helloworld   lt available everywhere as public.articles.data   title Hello World.,   date 20130228  ,  hellobrazil    title Hello Brazil.,   date 20130304    codepre  pIf I understand right codefor articlecode takes every high level object and we can get title with codearticle.titlecode or date with codearticle.datecode. But what is codeslugcode Is it the predefined variable in JadeHarpJs If so, are there others, or did I get the concept wrong I couldnt find any information on this topic, if there is a good article to read I would appreciate it. Thank you.p  pAs Brennan suggests in comments the second argument could be an index. Simple substitution and renaming of variables codearticlecode and codeslugcode proves that. But there is one more problem. Please consider this examplep  precode  helloworld    title Hello World.,   date 20130228,   test      testContent 123     ,  hellobrazil    title Hello Brazil.,   date 20130304      for s, a in public.articles.data  ahrefarticles a    h2 s.title   h3 s.date   h3 a    var obj   s.test   h3 obj   h3 obj.testContent codepre  pThis code gives error during the compilation. If I comment the very last line it works though. And I cant substitute last line with snippet from the docsp  precodeeach val, index in obj   h1index     val codepre  pThere are no nesting and twodimensional arraysp

Running codedtruss fcode on cabal returns without doing anything at all, because in the OS X version of the Haskell Platform, codeusrbincabalcode is a shell script which codeexeccodes codeLibraryHaskellbincabal.realcode.  Of course, I can get around that problem by just running codeLibraryHaskellbincabal.realcode directly, but that still doesnt buy me much, since codecabal.realcode is just going to turn around and codeexeccode a bunch of other stuff.  Think codemakecode if youre not familiar with Haskell.p

Negative 78326 pWe have a WPF software which makes use quite a lot of the async await pattern in order to not block the UI thread.  p  pFor instance, we use this pattern when opening a file The UI shows a spinner while in the background we do some IO loading operation and start tasks for long calculations which should not stop the loadingp  pWhat seems to happen is that my loading task is effectively launched on another thread, thus not blocking the UI. So that works. However, the loading task seems to run synchronously all the other tasks I create, such as long calculation which the loading does not need.p  pI pinpoint the debugger becausep  ul liI noticed that for big files, when the debugger is attached, the spinner runs longer for about 1020 times.  li liRunning release or debug version does not affect behavior.li liAs long as the debugger is attached, it is way slower.li liDetaching the debugger in the middle of the loading will run super fast right afterwards. li ul  pI know this only because when breaking with the debugger, I seep  ul liOn the current thread, the top of the call stack is my LoadProjectAsync, li liThat thread is currently in the code of the long calculations, which have been triggered by async void since we dont care about them immediately and thus shouldnt be run synchronouslyli liThe Tasks window in Visual Studio always show 1 Active task, and some other tasks which are always in the Complete status.

Negative 78326 pI read a great article about the a hrefhttpwww.javabeat.netsimpleintroductiontoforkjoinframeworkinjava7strongforkjoinstrong framework in Java 7a, and the idea is that, with codeForkJoinPoolcode and codeForkJoinTaskcode, the threads in the pool can get the sub tasks from other tasks, so its able to use less threads to handle more tasks.p  pThen I tried to use a normal codeExecutorServicecode to do the same work, and found I cant tell the difference, since when I submit a new task to the pool, the task will be run on another available thread.p  pThe only difference I can tell is if I use codeForkJoinPoolcode, I dont need to pass the pool to the tasks, because I can call codetask.forkcode to make it running on another thread.

Negative 78326 pIve looked at Python 2.7 socket documentation and most of the functions it seems are based on knowing the number of bytes to expect to receive in a certain time frame timeout.p  pWhat is a good algorithm or logic for listening on a python network socket without knowing how many bytes are really available at a given timep  pThe reason I ask is because I am trying to simulate a certain network device...the device expects 2 bytes to start listening to wake it up, the device is low power...then the device expects a sign on message which is 20 bytes...then it expects n number of 13 byte messages to actually read data...then a 9 bytes message to signoff.p  pIts hard to know how many bytes to expect and ask the socket for without making assumptions. For example, maybe the app sending data to the python network socket asks for data without sending the wakeup or signon state message first My python script masquerading as the network device needs to be able to figure this out and ignore the out of sequence message that could have 13 bytes when I really should only be getting 2 wakeup or 20 signon.p

Negative 78326 pI am working on a VS OnlineTFS backed project, and for now I am unable to commit changes to the trunk as that would set off an unwanted build and deploy by Team City.

Negative 78326 pI am trying to modify a wordpress plugin which I am using for music requests, to create a new better plugin... a hrefhttpswordpress.orgpluginsmusicrequestmanager relnofollowhttpswordpress.orgpluginsmusicrequestmanagerap  pThe plugin is activated by using a shortcode on any wordpress page, however what I would like to do is to use it to add a little more functionality. Essentially instead of being able to create a single request list, Id like to add multiple request list...p  pThe way I plan to do this is by editing the plugins PHP file, so that I can have a different request list for each page I place it on to allow me to have request lists for multiple events...p  pOne of the ways I thought about doing this was by using the wordpress page URL, however I believe that wordpress has a post number for every page which would be better... I think each page has a unique ID so perhaps this would be the best thing as it would allow users myself to edit the slug URL and title which, could be messy if we used those to separate out the lists...p  pThe code is pretty simple and creates a table, to which I have added a new row called codepageidcode which we will store the unique ID in...p  phowever my PHP isnt yet good enough to manipulate this. I know I need to create a variable which grabs the unique post ID, something like  codepostid  gettheIDcode and then with each dialogue with the table have WHERE codepageidpostidcode and when writing to the table also add the codepostidcode to the table under pageid along with the rest of it...p  pI guess the first question is can I codegettheIDcode in a wordpress plugin or am i barking up the wrong tree here p  pI have posted the full code below for your reference...p  pAny questions or if you have a better way to do this it would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp  pHenryp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltphp  Plugin Name Music Request Lists  Lite Plugin URI httpwww.CARBONYZED.co.uk Description Quickly and easily add a unique request list to any page by adding the shortcode [musicrequests].

Negative 78326 pFor multiple reasons, Im currently considering moving to a NoSQL DB to storemanage a set of scorecards. As scorecard is a simple table, with rows for  regions and columns for metricsindicators. As simple scorecard document for one month could look like thisp  precode   month 1,   headers [Region,  of page views,  of unique visitors],   data [      [Region 1, value 1000, previousValue 800, arrow up , value 100, previousValue 110, arrow down],      [Region 2, value 500, previousValue 600, arrow down , value 10, previousValue 11, arrow down]   ]  codepre  presulting in this rendered tablep  precode  Region    of page views   of unique visitors    Region 1  1000          100                 Region 2  500           10                 codepre  pEvery month, a new scorecard will be uploaded, i.e. a new document gets created. This scorecard might have a different structure, e.g. p  precode   month 2,   headers [Region,  of page views,  of comments],   data [      [Region 1, value 1100, previousValue 1000, arrow up, value 5, previousValue null, arrow null],      [Region 3, value 1500, previousValue null, arrow null,value 1, previousValue null, arrow null]   ]  codepre  presulting inp  precode  Region    of page views   of comments    Region 1  1100          5            Region 3  1500          1           codepre  pWhen I now receive an update for the month 1 scorecard, I also need to update the codepreviousValuecode and the codearrowcode property in the month 2 scorecard. Given that the structure might have changed, how can I do this update most efficiently How can I linked the cellsp  pIn a RDBMS, I would have normalized the values in another table and just linked the valueIds. However, as any scorecard can have a lot of values, I assume that storing the valueIds in the scorecard documents and retrieving all values in a second step is really inefficientp  pI have not decided on the NoSQL DB provider. Current favorite is CouchDb, but can also be MongoDB or DocumentDB. The backend is implemented in ASP.NET WebAPI.p

Negative 78326 pMy background is more in C.Net, and have now been offered to move to Intersystems Cache. I havent found any recent posts on this so unless I missed something here goes From what I understand Cache has some mapping for ADO.NET.NET, but is there something out there so I can use Cache for the DAL and C for the BLfront end like ASP.NET MVC Is there a port somewhat similar to Xamarin, that allows one to write everything in C, using Visual Studio I havent started with Cache yet, but from a brief glimpse it looks somewhat similar to C being string based and slightly similar approach to interfaces and implementation.

Negative 78326 pI have tried to write an implementation of Kargers algorithm for solving the min cut problem.

It looks okay to me but if I run it on any test graph I get a KeyError at the codel  g[x]code stage, and I cant understand why this is happening. Was hoping that some of you may be able to help me. Thanks.p  pEDIT my code is actually fine, the error was in the way I loaded the file with the adjacent list. Cobarzan, thank you for pointing out that Im not actually picking edges uniformly.p

Negative 78326 pI need to search a field in a table in a MySQL database for multiple versions of a string. For example, a user might search for a name of a store with the name Strings amp Things but might search for it using Strings and Things. Also, the query also searches a description field that might have the name stored as Strings amp Things. The dirty solution is to test for the existence of  amp  or  and  in the search and then add additional OR statements to the sql statement but regardless, any existence of  amp  or  and  in the query would require three or rather, since Im searching in two fields, six lookups for Strings and Things, Strings amp Things and Strings amp Things. Is there a simple way of combining this into one search term or, if possible, to do some of the heavier lifting on the sql side of things. For the record, Im using PHP. Full code isnt necessary. Pseudo code or a resource explaining this topic would be acceptable.p

Negative 78326 pI currently have written a simple event logger in the view of the old codeBackgroundworkercode class. I am trying to convert it to a TPL implementation. p  pI do not have enough usage with threading in C to really prefer one over the other but I do know that TPL is becoming more preferred to I wanted to stick with it as much as I can. Another reason is that with the current code I can not find an easy way to make the codeEventLogcode class thread safe. I am finding myself using codeBeginInvokecode to write to the log from non UI threads which just seems messy to me. p  pSo here is the original code.p  precodepublic class EventLog      public String LogPath  get set      public ListltLogEventgt Events  get private set       public static EventLog Instance  get  return lazyInstance.Value       private static readonly LazyltEventLoggt lazyInstance  new LazyltEventLoggt gt new EventLog      private EventLog              Events  new ListltLogEventgt         LogPath  Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.CodeBase         LogPath  Path.GetDirectoryNameLogPath         LogPath  LogPath.Replacefile,          LogPath  LogPath  Log.txt           public override void publishLogEvent newEvent              Events.AddnewEvent         if LogEventWriter.Instance.IsBusy             LogEventWriter.Instance.RunWorkerAsyncLogPath         LogEventWriter.Instance.LogEvents.AddnewEvent        internal class LogEventWriter  BackgroundWorker      public BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt LogEvents  get set       public static LogEventWriter Instance  get  return lazyInstance.Value       private static readonly LazyltLogEventWritergt lazyInstance  new LazyltLogEventWritergt gt new LogEventWriter      private LogEventWriter              WorkerSupportsCancellation  true         LogEvents  new BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt           protected override void OnDoWorkDoWorkEventArgs e              if e.Argument  null ampamp e.Argument is String                      String logPath  Stringe.Argument             using StreamWriter logFile  new StreamWriterlogPath, true                              while CancellationPending                                      LogEvent anEvent  LogEvents.Take                     logFile.WriteLineanEvent.Message                     logFile.Flush                     if anEvent.Message.ContainsApplication Terminated                         break                                  logFile.Close                               e.Cancel  true       codepre  pMy current train of thought for the log is to write the log to a file ASAP in case of a system failure so that the log will have as much information as it can. This is what the codeBackgroundworkercode is for. I also just keep a codeListltLogEventgtcode in the codeEventLogcode class so that the user might be able to search the current log for specific events not fully implementedpolished off. p  pHere is my current TPL solution. I have tried as best I can to wrap the logging functionality into codeTaskcodes but it I still feel like I should have a function akin to codepublishcode and not have to directly place codeLogEventcodes into a codeBlockingCollectionltgtcode so that I can run the logging on a separate thread from the main UI.p  pAlso is there a cleaner way to stop the codeTaskcodes without having to send a special codeLogEventcode to them to codebreakcode from their loopsp  precodepublic class EventLog      public static EventLog Instance  get  return lazyInstance.Value       private static readonly LazyltEventLoggt lazyInstance  new LazyltEventLoggt gt new EventLog      public String LogPath  get set      public ConcurrentQueueltLogEventgt Events  get set       private EventLog              Events  new ConcurrentQueueltLogEventgt         WriteQueue  new BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt         LogEventQueue  new BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt          LogPath  Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.CodeBase         LogPath  Path.GetDirectoryNameLogPath         LogPath  LogPath.Replacefile,          LogPath  LogPath  LogASDF.txt          StartManager         StartWriter           public BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt LogEventQueue  get set      private void StartManager              var writeTask  Task.Factory.StartNew gt                      while true                              LogEvent anEvent  LogEventQueue.Take                 Events.EnqueueanEvent                 WriteQueue.AddanEvent                 if anEvent.Message.ContainsApplication Terminated                     break                                 private BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt WriteQueue  get set      private void StartWriter              var writeTask  Task.Factory.StartNew gt                      using StreamWriter logFile  new StreamWriterLogPath, true                              whiletrue                                      LogEvent anEvent  WriteQueue.Take                     logFile.WriteLineanEvent.Message                     logFile.Flush                     if anEvent.Message.ContainsApplication Terminated                         break                                  logFile.Close                             codepre  ol liHow can I properly use codeCancellationTokencode to cancel both of the tasks I do not see how if codeBlockingCollectioncode is blocking, I always have to pulse the collection to get it to unblock.li liIs there a cleaner way to insert an codeLogEventcode into the log without having to directly insert it into codeLogEventQueuecodeli ol

Negative 78326 pIn iOS when Ive got a blocking socket with a timeout set using SORCVTIMEO. When I change the WiFi network that the device is connected to, the calls to recv will timeout appropriately, but errno will be reported as EWOULDBLOCK and recv returns 1.p  pThis causes my outer processing loop attempt to access the socket again as it seems there is just no data available right now, when realistically this is impossible at this point as the device is now connected to a different network endpoint.  p  pIf I just kill the network altogether, several repeated calls to recv will eventually fail with ETIMEDOUT, after many EWOULDBLOCK.p  pWhy does this occur  Shouldnt the socket connection be broken and fail with ENETRESET or a similar errnop  pIf I dont have the SORCVTIMEO, then the socket will block forever when the WiFi network changes.  Also no bueno.p  pEDIT  I would think that I could just enable SOKEEPALIVE on the local socket to detect when the remote socket stops responding due to the underlying network endpoint changing.  This doesnt seem to work either.p

Negative 78326 pI recently had a very, very intense debate about the runtime complexity of a super simple algorithm with a colleague of mine.  In the end we both agreed to disagree but as Ive been thinking about this, its challenged my basic understanding of computer science fundamentals and so I therefore must get additional insight on the matter.p  pGiven the following python, what is the BigO runtime complexityp  precodefor c in How are you today     print c codepre  pNow, I immediately called out that this is simply on the order of On aka linear.  Meaning its dependent on the length of the string so therefore this loop will grow linearly as the length of the string grows.p  pMy colleague then said, No, its constant because we know that for the set of all strings we are dealing with in our case, the max string is always 255 characters long in our case, therefore it must be constant.  He followed on by saying because we have a max upperbound on character length of the string this results in O255 which reduces to O1.p  pAnyways, we went back and fourth and after 45 minutes of both of us drawing sketches we both deadlocked on the issue.p  pMy question is in what world or what math system is the loop above a constant time loop  If we knew our upperbound was say 1,000,000 characters and the set of all strings could be anywhere from 0 to 1,000,000 this loop will obviously exhibit linear running times depending on the size of the string.p  pI additionally asked him if he also thinks the following code is O1 if the upperbound size of n is known.  Meaning we are certain this code will only ever operate on a max upperbound of say 255 charactersp  precodes  How are you today for c in s     for d in s         print cd codepre  pHe said this is also constant time....even after I explained this is an On2 algorithm and demonstrated that the following code would produce a quadratic curve.p  pSo, am I missing some theoretical concept where any of the above is true depending on how the theory goes  strongJust to be clear his understanding is that I am correct if n is not known.  If the upperbound of n is always known he is asserting that the two algorithms on this post are both of constant runtime complexity.strongp  pJust looking to maintain my sanity, but perhaps if Im wrong theres certainly some additional learning I can benefit from.  My good, good colleague was very convincing. Also, if anybody has additional links or material on the subject specific to this question please add to the comments.p

Negative 78326 pSo Im trying to add something into some elisp mode hooks  specifically, Id like to define a hooks codeprettifysymbolsalistcode and then specifically activate it by calling codeprettifysymbolsmodecode. p  pIn any case, Im getting codeorgbabelcode to export the values into a pair of lists from a table, using codepairliscode to tie them together as an alist, and codeaddhookcode it into the desired mode using a anonymous function.p  pSo, the thing is, right now if I use a global variable, like the following, it worksp  precodelet token quote not   gt map  lt gt lambda       code quote 172 215 247 8594 8614 8800 8804 8805 955  Generated automatically using orgbabel    require cl    setq globalvar pairlis token code    addhook emacslispmodehook             lambda                 setq prettifysymbolsalist globalvar                prettifysymbolsmode 1 codepre  pBut if I try to not use a global variable, by doing it this way, it doesnt workp  precodelet token quote not   gt map  lt gt lambda       code quote 172 215 247 8594 8614 8800 8804 8805 955  Generated automatically using orgbabel   let localv     require cl      setq localv pairlis token code      addhook emacslispmodehook               lambda                   setq prettifysymbolsalist localv                  prettifysymbolsmode 1 codepre  pI kind of know why if I codeCh v emacslispmodehookcode, Ill see that it refers to whatever variable I used in the codeletcode form, which works when the variable exists, as in codeglobalvarcode, but not when I use codelocalvarcode, which no longer exists outside of its codeletcode form.

Negative 78326 pI tend to write my equals method in Java as a one liner...p  precodeclass Test     private String a      private Integer b  Integer.MINVALUE    private Long c  Long.MINVALUE     public Testfinal String a, final Integer b, final Long c         this.a  a        this.b  b        this.c  c         Override    public boolean equalsfinal Object obj          return obj instanceof Test ampamp Test obj.a.equalsthis.a           ampamp Test obj.b.equalsthis.b           ampamp Test obj.c.equalsthis.c      codepre  pAs you can see, in this approach I downcast the Object instance to Test instance many times. My question is, will it be optimised by the compiler so there will be a single downcast instead of three like if I wrote my equals method like thisp  precode public boolean equalsfinal Object obj       if obj instanceof Test           final Test test  Test obj          return test.a.equalsthis.a ampamp test.b.equalsthis.b            ampamp test.c.equalsthis.c       else           return false         codepre  pIt is not a duplicate of the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2165246isthereanyruntimecostforcastinginjavaquestiona in comment, because I am interested here in brevity of the implementation of the equals method 6 lines against 3 but not at cost of a performance degradation.
