Positive 68068 pI am trying to display a set of questions on the application employee profile ExtJS 4.2.3 screen, and the answers to these questions will be options radio buttons say  YesNoNA. The issue I am facing is that I need to fetch these questions from the database, and populate these questions amp radio buttons dynamically.p  pOnce the user selects the answers to these questions for a particular employee, we also need to save these questions FK and the answers to those questions against the employee.p  pA static representation would be as shown in image. I am new to ExtJS and facing issues to identify, which component like a fieldcontainer should I use, how to dynamically populate multiple values, and then while saving, how to pass these values back to the database.a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com3rSGr.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3rSGr.png altSampleap

Positive 68068 pI have an object wich caches windows with all their internal structure form, other ui elements. So when a user opens a window which has already been cached, it does create it from scratch, but takes if from cache and just show it like thisp  precodewinCache[idgroup].show codepre  pSo, for each codeidgroupcode, there is a codewindowcode which may be cached in codewinCachecode. The problem is that I want to reset a codeformcode, which is inside the codewindowcode, and populate it with new data from database. I try to do it like thisp  precodeifwinCache[idgroup]     winCache[idgroup].removeListenershow     winCache[idgroup].addListenershow, function         populateformthis, idfield  lt this method retreives data from database      and sets the form            winCache[idgroup].show    else   window was not cached and has to be created from scratch   var win  ...   win.show    ... some BIG procedure   winCache[idgroup]  win  next time it will be taken from cache  codepre  pBut the problem is, for some insane reason, codeExtJScode duplicates codeshowcode listeners infinitely. So, for example, if I open codewinCache[10]code seven times for the same codeidgroupcode  code10code, but for different codeidfieldcodes idfield  1, idfield  2, ..., idfield  7, then codeshowcode listener will be triggered seven times  for each idfield. And that is incredible stupidity. So, my question is why codeExtJScode duplicates listeners And why doesnt coderemoveListenercode workp
