Positive 342 pHere is what I am trying to do.p  pI want to have an object that has a queue and starts a thread. Another thread can push to that queue by doing object.addWorkworkp  pThat will push work into the queue and wake the thread if it it sleeping. The thread then performs the work on each object in the queue until the queue is empty.p  pOnce the queue is empty and no more work is left, that thread sleeps and needs to be awoken by adding to the queue again.p  pIs there a threadsafe way of making such an objectp

Positive 342 pIm just wondering whether an delayed stream processing is possible with Kinesis streams And is this delayed processing possible with Lambda functionsp  pId like to group several interactions of a user over 5 Minutes before closing his session and processing his data. Thus I would write all data of a session into one Kinesis stream partition.p  pFor me right now it is a little bit unclear than Lambda functions are invoced to consume Kinesis streams and how i can adjust the stream consumtionp  pCan I adjust stream consumtion by time  datachunk limitsp  pCan the consumtion of kinesis partitions be delayed E.g. wait at least 5 min before partitions are processed.p

Positive 342 pIm trying to save a series of frames from Kinect II to the hard drive as jpegs. In order to do so, I add each new frame to a queue and then, at the end of the programme, I dequeue and write down to separate jpeg files, one frame per file, as that is what I want.

Positive 342 pBasically, I have a REST API built with Pecan. It is receiving a POST message with an action to be performed. When it does determine the correct action, it is creating a task using Celery which is using RabbitMQ as queuer, with codeapp  Celerytasks,  backendamqp, brokeramqpcelerycelerylocalhostcelerycode. p  pWhen Celery receives the task, it starts processing it in the correct queue I have 3 queues. While processing, all the details are saved manually, with python code into CouchDB, with an codeactivecode status.p  pSo far everything is fine. But what I want to achieve is that when I do codeservice ltceleryqueuegt restartcode queues are daemonized, all the tasks that were saved into CouchDB with a field called status of codeactivecode or codeopencode are automatically picked up and start processing.p  pI dont care the current status of them when the service was restarted, because all the code is idempotent so it can be started over again, what I need is that all objects in CouchDB with a status of codeactivecode or codeopencode are grabbed from Celery after a service restart.p  pDo you know how this can be achieved Thank you very much in advancep

Positive 342 pOkay so I need to create codequeuecodecontains enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty methods, codequeueNodecodestores names, setters and getters, and codequeueUsercodeMain classes. User enters one name at a time. Once 3 names have been entered, each new name entered will kick the front of the queue to the screen. This process will continue until the user enters quit as the name. Once this happens, all the remaining names will be displayed. I have everything but my usermain class. I cant seem to get it to work properly. It accepts 3 names, and after the third name is entered, displays the first name that was entered. Problem is, it stops there. I need it to keep going. I have a feeling I need a different loop, but I am just stuck right now. No help from my instructor, nothing in my textbook, and I have hit a brick wall.

Positive 342 pI have a Laravel job that I dispatch to read customer data from a file. The job has a logger model dependency, and this logger tracks certain stats then writes to a log db table when the job completes. When I dispatch this job immediately it works fine, but if I queue the exact same job with the exact same parameters and then run it from the queue it fails with the errorp  precode[IlluminateDatabaseEloquentModelNotFoundException]                  No query results for model [appModelsMyModel]. codepre  pI think this is due to the serializeunserialize nature inherent in the Laravel queue system which breaks Eloquent, which tries the findOrFail method when I am never actually trying to find something in the db. I am merely creating a new log from a blank model. Whatever the case, it is clear that the same Laravel job, when not queued, runs fine  but it fails when queued. I am at a loss and wondering if there is a way to work around this issue. p  pThanks.p
Positive 342 pI am working with pyQT, QGIS and I am threading a task at the end of which I want to open a messagebox saying that the task is over. In order to do so I need to send a message to the main thread when the second thread is terminated.

Using q.join I wait for the thread to terminate daemon is set to True and print the message box. p  pThe problem is that q.join makes the main user interface hang and if I remove it the code goes straight to the messagebox printing that the background task is over even if it is executing in background.p  pNow, I think I did not quite well understand how queue works and if it is the appropriate solution to my problem, any other suggestions are welcomed, but I would tend to avoid pyQtThread.

Positive 342 pI am writing a script that uses a queue to track the last six numbers of a list of length N. In other words, as I iterate over the list of length N, I want to track the last six numbers.

It would then parse the jobs ID for relevant information, run the simulation, and if it exits without errors, move the job ID to the CompletedJobs table.p  pWould this workp

Positive 342 pIm currently working on a C project handed to me by a co worker and Ive run into a problem using strongcodestdqueuecodestrong.p  pThe program is designed to read in 18 byte message files and decode into their relative parts. There are 5 different types of message that can be decoded and the user chooses which types they want to be decoded when the program loads. All the messages are stored in 1 file that contains around 9418588 messages, so the program reads in the large file, decodes the first 4 bytes of the first message and determines what type of message it is. It then stores the message in a queue designated for that message type. Later on in the program, once all the telegrams are in the appropriate queue, the program decodes the remaining bytes of the message and outputs the relevant parts to a .csv file.p  pThe test Im running at the moment decodes 2 different types of messages, stores them in the relevant queue, decodes them and outputs them.

It does however have the correct value of total input messages  9418588.p  pAs I said the code is exactly the same, the only thing I can think is that the difference in hardware is causing the second computer to stores less messages in the queue but I have no idea why this would be happening. p  pIm not sure if I need to provide any code for the question, or if its a simple answer. I hope someone can shed some light on the issue. The program uses threading if that helps, if any more information is needed please ask.p  pThanks in advancep

Positive 342 pI have a restful service written in Java using the Jersey Framework that implements an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol on top of a RabbitMQ server. p  pWhen a consumer gets a message from a given channel he is given a delivery tag. This delivery tag is used in a separate rest call to acknowledge receipt of the message and remove it from the queue entirely. However, since each channel has its own set of delivery tags starting with tag id 1, the acknowledgement request must know which channel to send the acknowledgement back to, otherwise we get an unknown delivery tag exception.p  pOne way I have thought of tracking this is by using some kind of dictionary that stores a generated GUID as the key and stores the channel and delivery tag id as the value. I could pass the GUID to the consumer on a consume call, store the GUID with its associated channel and delivery tag in the dictionary, and then when the ack call comes back with the GUID, I could then look up the proper channel and delivery tag and ack it. p  pThere is one problem with this method though, the restful java application that is running on top of the single running RabbitMQ server must run in a load balanced environment, which means a consume request could come in and hit one running instance of the application and store the channeldelivery tag in its local dictionary. Then when it calls to ack that message it could hit another running instance of the application, which would have a different set of GUIDs in its local dictionary and thus would not be able to look up the necessary channeldelivery tag needed to ack. p  pOf course I could store the channeldelivery tag info in an external database, but that would kind of defeat the purpose of using a queue in the first place.p  pHow would you have a restful RabbitMQ service that requires acknowledging messages, can be load balanced, and has one channel per thread, if you have to send the acknowledgment on the same channel you consumed fromp

The naive way to do this is to check every range in the list to see if the input range x is a subset, and if so, NOT insert range x.

Negative 342 pI have been programming in Python, PHP, Java and C for a couple or years now, and I just finished reading Hackers and Painters, so I would love to give LISP a tryp  pI understand its totally diferent from what i know and that it wont be easy. Also I think please correct me if Im wrong theres way less community and development around LISP. So my question is whats the best way to learn LISPp  pI wouldnt mind buying books or investing some time. I just dont want it to be wasted.p  pThe final idea would be to use LISP for web development, and I know thats not so common so... I know its good to plan my learning before picking the first book or tutorial and spending lots of time on something that may not be the best way p  pThank you all for your answersp  pstrongeditstrong I read Practical Common Lisp and was ... long, hard, interesting and definitely got me rolling in Lisp, after that i read the little schemer, and it was short, fun and very very good for my overall programming. So my recommendation would be to read first the little schemer, then its a couple of hours and its worth it if you decide lispor scheme or whatever dialect is not what you where looking for, you will still have a very fun new way of thinking about recursionp
Negative 342 pMy web app has a servlet called admin which when navigated to checks if the user is logged in and if the are directs to the the admin section, but if they arent it directs them to a JSP page with a signin form.  The name of the JSP doesnt appear in the URL, it stays as admin.  But then when the JSP posts to another servlet to validate the signin credentials the url changes to validate which is the name of the servlet.  If the user validates they are forwarded to another JSP, but the URL still remains as validate.  How can I ensure the URL reflects what is being viewed in the browserp  pApologies if this isnt too clear.p

Negative 342 pIve added a Web Deployment Project to my solution to create a clean deployment of my web application. This works mostly as expected... i.e. builds the source amp then copies the files to be deployed to a Release folder and excludes things like source files and my .svn folders, etc.p  pBut now I want to explicitly exclude some other files for the sake of simplicity lets just say one file called somefile.txt. So, I add an item group to the wdproj file as followsp  precodeltItemGroupgt     ltExcludeFromBuild Includesomefile.txt gt ltItemGroupgt codepre  pThis does indeed exclude the specific file as requested, but now the files excluded by default are no longer excluded. Specifically, now all my svn files are in the Release folder amp theres also a Source folder at the same level with all the source in it.p  pBasically, it seems that defining the ExcludeFromBuild item group is overwriting some set of builtin defaults, rather than adding to them.p  pNot exactly a show stopper, but not ideal... So, does anyone know how to simply add a file to the default ExcludeFromBuild group Or is it a case of using the defaults Vs. excluding everything by hand Vs. deleting the files you dont after a default buildp

Negative 342 pAfter reading the MSDN article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazine2009.01.genevests.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazine2009.01.genevests.aspxa on implementing a Custom STS using the Microsoft Geneva Framework I am a bit puzzled about one of the scenarios covered there. This scenario is shown in figure 13 of the above referenced article.p  pMy questions are around how does the RP initiate the call to the RPSTS in order to pass on the already obtained claims from the IPSTS How does the desired method DeleteOrder get turned into a Claim Request for the Action claim from the RPSTS which responds with the Action claim with a value Delete which authorizes the call I also think the figure is slightly incorrect in that the interaction between the RPSTS and the Policy Engine should have the Claims and arrows the other way around.p  pI can see the structure but its not clear what is provided by GenevaWCF and what has to be done in code inside the RP, which would seem a bit odd since we could not protect the DeleteOrder method with a PrincipalPermission demand for the Delete permission but would have to demand a Role first then obtain the finegrained claim of the Delete Action after that point.p  pIf I have missed the point since I cannot find this case covered easily on the Web, then apologiesp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 342 pI have a couple of Python functions that I use to make game development with Pygame easier. I have them in a file called helper.py in my Pythonpath, so I can import them from any game I make. I thought, as an exercise to learn about Python extensions, to convert this module to C. My first problem is that I need to use functions from Pygame, and Im not sure if this is possible. Pygame installs some header files, but they dont seem to have C versions of the Python functions. Maybe Im missing something.p  pHow can I solve this As a workaround, the function currently accepts a function parameter and calls that, but its not the ideal solution.p  pUsing Windows XP, Python 2.6 and Pygame 1.9.1, by the way.p

Negative 342 pIm wondering if anyone is currently utilizing Microsofts Master Data Services How you are utilizing it Whether you find it useful When you believe it would be useful Thanksp
Negative 342 pI have an application I have just deployed which, for complicated reasons, stores all the data from the database in a module the first time any data from the specific table is required i.e. when a customer requests to view a product for the first time, all the product data is stored in the ProductManager class of which an instance is stored in a shared property of the SiteContent class, making the ProductManager easily accessible from any page.p  pNow forget that you are probably now glaring at me for using this approach.. I am sure it has its inefficiencies but I have only been studying .Net for a year or so now so I am still learning.p  pOne thing I have noticed is that I can go on the site once, then revisit it 5 minutes later and it will load all the data into the ProductManager class again. It seems this is a .Net application timeout thing  since the session timeout is set to 30 minutes and, when I am logged in on the administration frontend, it logs me out after 5 minutes ish.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how to change this Is there any way I can change this in the code without having to contact the hosting company If not in the code is there any way to change this in the web.configp  pThanks in advance.p  pRegards,p  pRichardp  pMore detailsp  pThe module SiteContent stores an instance of each Manager class  pages can call Manager.Create, Manager.Update, Manager.Remove etc etc and use Manager.Items to access a list of items stored in the manager for example SiteContent.ProductManager.Items returns all the products stored in the database and SiteContent.UserManager.Items returns a list of all users stored in the database. It seems that, because it is a module, it is shared between users and page loads.p  pI have tried coming back to a page and reloading it after 3  4 minutes and it loads fine, but after about 5 minutes it takes a few seconds to load the page again not long  but I would rather it didnt add a few seconds to the first page load every 5 minutes.p  pThis is particularly annoying for my Dad the owner of the business when he is entering products which take more than 5 minutes to enter or which, when entering them, he takes a break for 2 minutes and then it asks him to login again on clicking submit, losing all his data at the same time. I am strongnotstrong using a method specified in the authentication section of the web.config for logging in  I am using a form with a login button, and clicking it compares the entered username and password to that of each user through SiteContent.UserManager.Items.p  pOther than this I dont know exactly what you want to know.. can you expand on any specifics you need to knowp  pOn doing some googling I have found out that there is an executionTimeout and a shutdownTimeout which I will have a go at changing..p  pMore detailsp  phmm seems I just solved the page load time problem.. I noticed that the test database was over 13MB and the live database was only 3MB. I had a little investigate into this.p  pBasically the error logger will log every time and image cant be found if it is requested in the catalogue page. The test site hasnt been kept up to date with the images, since it doesnt need to be, so the missing image table had gone up to  strong10MBstrong.. gonna have to disable image logging on test. I deleted everything from that table and everything loads quickly now.p  pAs for the timeout thing, I am going to leave that till a later date now  I am spending way too much time on this when I have more important things to prioritize at this moment  this website was actually my final year project at uni, and I have a presentation about it on Friday.. will be sure to add more details to this post about how I get on with this problem in the future, so please check back here from time to time..p  pThanks for spending so much time on this..p  pRegards,p  pRichardp

Negative 342 pI often find myself with fairly complex data that represents something that my objects will be working on.  For example, in a tasklist app, several objects might work with an array of tasks, each of which has attributes, temporal expressions, sub tasks and sub sub tasks, etc.  p  pOne object will collect data from web forms, standardize it into a format consumable by the class that will save them to the database, another object will pull them from the database, put them in the standard format and pass them to the display object, or the update object, etc.p  pThe data itself can become a fairly complex series of arrays and sub arrays, representing a task or list of tasks.p  pFor example, the below might be one entry in a task list, in the format that is consumable by the various objects that will work on it.  Normally, I just document this in a file somewhere with an example.  However, I am thinking about the best way to add it to something like PHPDoc, or another standard doc system.p  pWhere would you document your consumable data formats that are for many or all of the objects  methods in your appp  precodeArray      [Meta] gt Array                      etc.               [Sched] gt Array                      [SchedID] gt 32             [OwnerID] gt 2             [StatusID] gt 1             [DateFirstTask] gt 20110228             [DateLastTask] gt              [MarginMonths] gt 3               [TemporalExpressions] gt Array                      [0] gt Array                                      [type] gt dw                     [TemporalExpID] gt 3                     [ord] gt 2                     [day] gt 6                     [month] gt 4                               [1] gt Array                                      [type] gt dm                     [TemporalExpID] gt 32                     [day] gt 28                     [month] gt 2                                 [Task] gt Array                      [SchedTaskID] gt 32             [SchedID] gt 32             [OwnerID] gt 2             [UserID] gt 5             [ClientID] gt 9             [Title] gt Close Prior Year             [Body] gt              [DueTime] gt                [SubTasks] gt Array                      [101] gt Array                                      [SchedSubTaskID] gt 101                     [ParentST] gt                      [RootT] gt 32                     [UserID] gt 2                     [Title] gt Review Profit and Loss by Class                      [Body] gt                      [DueDiff] gt 0                               [102] gt Array                                      [SchedSubTaskID] gt 102                     [ParentST] gt                      [RootT] gt 32                     [UserID] gt 2                     [Title] gt Review Balance Sheet                     [Body] gt                      [DueDiff] gt 0                               [103] gt Array                                      [SchedSubTaskID] gt 103                     [ParentST] gt                      [RootT] gt 32                     [UserID] gt 2                     [Title] gt Review Current Year for Prior Year Expenses to Accrue                     [Body] gt Look at Journal Entries that are templates as well.

Negative 342 pI have two branches, one is the master, one is test. This name was dualpurpose, I was not only testing the branches, but testing out some changes as well. Now, I have the test branch working great. However, I am not working alone. The master branch is being worked on too. Now, I would love to copy my test branch over to the main. Then, I would love to do a pull and see what changes have been made so I can push the changes.p  pFirst, I am using Aptana. I tried the dropdown settings button. I clicked and attempted to merge while on the Master branch with the test branch. This did something, not really sure what. It then said I had a problem. So, now, I ran git mergetool, and again, this did something. It said everything was good.Now, the two branches are both working as they should, however, they are not identical. In fact, they are both exactly what they were before any merge took place.p  pWhat can I do to fix this test is the important branch right now, it has all my work. Master has some important stuff, but not locally. Any suggestions would be great.p

Negative 342 pIm working on a simple parser to transform javainterfaces and value objects to C. This is done, so a C client to communicate with the java JMS server can be created automatically.p  pMy parser is almost finished, I can read genericinformatins, reuse C types, and even merger getter and setter methods to properties. The only thing i cant, because its not possible to be done with reflections, is to read the parameter names of methods in an interfaces. I found a library BCEL and can read the parameter names of real methods, in classes, but not within an interfaces.p  pSo my idea was, eitherway it would be cool to have the former java comments also transfered into .net, so i could use it and i could use the very same tool to get the parameter names, since they can also read them.p  pSo my question, do you know of any library which i could use for this I have the generated javadocs and also the sourcecode which i could use as a source for the tool.p  pThank you very much cheers zahorakp

Negative 342 pIs there a way to write a new subtree to an XML node in SQL, specifically for a dynamic query I know its possible using some combination of codeinsertcode and codedeletecode statements, but Im looking for something that works in a fairly implicit way.

So for example, say I have this XML hierarchyp  precodeltrootgt     ...     ltnodegt         ltnode1gt             ...         ltnode1gt         ltnode2gt             ...         ltnode2gt         ...     ltnodegt     ... ltrootgt codepre  pIf I want to replace the value of a single node, I have this queryp  precodeDECLARE newVal varcharmax DECLARE XPath varcharmax SELECT newVal  newValue SELECT XPath  rootnodenode1text  DECLARE query varcharmax  SET query       UPDATE  [dbo].[Users]     SET     [NewSettingsXml].modify         replace value of   XPath  [1]         with   newVal   execquery codepre  pI was hoping that I would just be able to do something like codenewVal  ltnewNodegtfooltnewNodegtcode, where the new XML would come from a serialized C object, but, not surprisingly, it encodes the value into text, setting it as codeampltnewNodeampgtfooampltnewNodeampgtcode instead.

Negative 342 pWe have a huge InnoDB table with hundreds of millions of rows and only 3 columns GUID, enum, smallint. All lookups are done by GUID.p  pWere considering making GUID the PK and partitioning it BY KEY. p  pWeve heard that using GUID as PK is bad because of its random distribution and the fact that PK creates clustered index. So storing rows in random order of GUIDs increases fragmentation and page splits.p  pThe alternative to using GUID as PK is to create a surrogate autoincrement key, and use that as PK. However, if we want to partition the table by GUID, that GUID has to be part of PK as well. Also, since all queries are done by GUID, we need an additional GUID index. That index essentially maps GUIDPK, while if we use GUID as PK  the table itself maps GUIDenumsmall intp  pSo my question is whether we gain anything by adding autoinc PK and having additional GUID indexp  pThanks, Philopator.p

I know that I my question is a bad one since it is highly specific to my problem but Ill try to describe the problem the best and most general way I can...p  pstrongSome backgroundstrongbr In my code, I have a data structure named codebeadcode which holds, among other an integer variable named codeLIDcode.

Negative 342 pI am beginning to use Backbone and am trying to transition my Rails backends html templates to javascript templates. p  pOne thing I thought using backbone would be more advantageous is its concept of Models and Collections. So say, I have 100 records and am paginating these records to 10 per page, normally, without quite a bit of javascript work, one can hardly expect a emcachedem, emajaxem, emonepageem pagination experience. meaning, say, I landed on page one and now click page two, page two requests the next 10 records ajaxly, and if I then click page one, I wont be making any more request to the server because it was there. p  pI havent had any code written up but can anyone tell me how I can append the ajax requested newly arrived data to the existing collection for paginationp  pFor instance, remember Backbones documentation say that your first load of the page should really contain bootstrapped data instead of making a second trip to fetch them. So p  precodevar projectsdata  lt projects.tojson.htmlsafe gt var projects  new Cafe.Collections.ProjectsCollection var projects.resetprojectsdata codepre  pNow my projects variable contains, say, the first 10 records, and I someone retreive another round of 10, say, I save these newly arrived 10 in the variablep  precodevar projectsdatanew  ... codepre  pCan I append them to the existing projects collectionp  pOr is this not the design pattern encouraged in Backbone in the case of pagination p

Negative 342 pI am developing an application with NH and Sql Server. I have decided to go with the method of creating the database structure myself then map with NH afterwards.p  pWhen creating a database structure I like to use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity. In the cases where there is a one to one table mapping which is nullable, I have in the past created a dummy zero ID row on the lookup table. The reason that I have done this is because I have seen that left join queries were not as performant as full joins.p  pi am keen to improve and interested to get some advice for whether i should pursue this again with my new database structure which would mean getting NH to ignore zero IDs globally upon selects somehow. i suspect this could be fraught with danger when using NH and perhaps i am better taking an alternative route with the database. any advice very appreciated thanks. p

So, strongIndirectstrong will be accessible to an user if strongdirectstrong is accessible, and strongIndirect2strong will be if strongindirectdirectstrong is, etc.p  pMy problem is, how can I do this query Im tempted to write something likep  precodeIndirect.objects.filterQcanreadcontentobjectFdirect, canreadusercurrentuser, restofquery  Indirect2.objects.filterQcanreadcontentobjectFindirectdirect, canreadusercurrentuser, restofquery codepre  pbut that doesnt work Django expects a relation between strongCanReadstrong and strongIndirectstrong  which doesnt exist  for the reverse query to work. If I were writing it directy in SQL, I would do something likep  precodeSELECT    FROM indirect i     JOIN direct d ON i.direct  d.id     JOIN canread c ON c.objectid  d.id   WHERE     c.contenttype  ltltcontent type for Directgtgt AND     c.user  ltltcurrent usergtgt AND     ltltrestofquerygtgt codepre  pbut I cant translate that query to Django. Is it possible If not, what would be the least instrusive way of doing it using as little raw SQL as possiblep  pThanks for your timep  pNote The workaround mentioned would be not to use generic fk...  I could discard the strongCanReadstrong model and have many strongCanReadDirectstrong, strongCanReadDirect2strong, strongCanReadDirect3strong, etc. Its a minor hassle, but wouldnt hinder my project too much.p

The design looks good on my own 22 screen and on my 42 tv, but when its shown on i.e. an iPad or iMac or even a difference size tv, it doesnt fit the screen. If its shown on the 27 iMac it only fills up the 14 of the screen and on iPad, the elements are too large to display.p  pI feel like I have overlooked something here  or is it just plainout impossible to create a fullscreen webdesign that works on all monitorsp  pAny helpinput on this is greatly appreciated p  pThanks a lot in advance.p  ul liBoli ul  pEDIT I took a few screenshots for youp  pFirst the iMac 27p  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox1920x1080.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox1920x1080.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox2560x1440.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox2560x1440.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari1920x1080.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari1920x1080.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari2560x1440.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari2560x1440.pngap  pAnd the TVp  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox1080itv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox1080itv.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox720ptv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox720ptv.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari1080itv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari1080itv.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari720ptv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari720ptv.pngap  pAnd the link to the solution p  pa hrefhttpgrenaabilhus.mercatusdemocms.dk relnofollowhttpgrenaabilhus.mercatusdemocms.dkap

Negative 342 p Hy guys, p  p    So i have a really big performance issue here. I have a WPF application which connects to a service which runs inside a Worker Role. The service uses net tcp binding with full duplex. The data access layer is all in a library which i am referencing in my service. So when my service wants to get data it uses the methods in that library. That library uses EF 4.1 which is mapped to an Sql Azure database. p  p    The problem i am facing is that a query like getting a user from a database, takes somewhere above 4 seconds. I have also a http serviceused by a Silverlight app which uses the same dataaccess library, the same query over there takes 115ms, which is normal. p  p    Is there a problem with the Entity Framework when i am using a net tcp service I really dont know where the issue is, because over a http service all the queries behave normaly. p

Negative 342 pI was reading about the GC in the book codeCLR via Ccode, specifically about when the CLR wants to start a collection.  I understand that it has to suspend the threads before a collection occurs, but it mentions that it has to do this when the thread instruction pointer reaches a safe point.  In the cases where its not in a safe point, it tries to get to one quickly, and it does so by codehijackingcode the thread inserting a special function pointer in the thread stack.  Thats all fine and dandy, but I thought managed threads by default were safep  pI had initially thought it might have been referring to unmanaged threads, but the CLR lets unmanaged threads continue executing because any object being used should have been pinned anyway.p  pstrikeSo, what is a codesafe pointcode in a managed thread, and how can the GC determine what that isstrikep  pEDITp  pI dont think I was being specific enough.  According to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary678ysw69.aspxthis MSDN articlea, even when codeThread.Suspendcode is called, the thread will not actually be suspended until a codesafe pointcode is reached.  It goes on to further state that a codesafe pointcode is a point in a threads execution at which a garbage collection can be performed.p  pI think I was unclear in my question.  I realize that a Thread can only be suspended at a safe point and they have to be suspended for a GC, but I cant seem to find a clear answer as to what a safe point is.

Negative 342 pIm writing a web service which returns results. This results are some data that is being created on the server all the time. So when the client asks for a resource i want to give him also a url for the next query he can preform to get the new data created on the server. For example, client can start with the following urlp  precodehttpipportserveridresource codepre  pand next time he should use something likep  precodehttpipportserveridresource1234 codepre  pwhere 1234 is some pointer to the server to know which result the client has already recieved. So the question is, where do i return the url to the next set of results should it be in the header or in the body I read some reference about usage of url parameters vs. query, and if i understood for chaching i better use uri rather then query. Last thing, i need to pass info the body for the request and therefore the web service expects PUT and not GET. Restlet example will be mostly appreciated.p  pOne last thing, i must have id in the url, but there is no such uri asp  precode httpipportserver codepre  pso what would be the right way for users to know there id the results are returned per users id. the id ia allocated by completly different resource.p

Negative 342 pIm not sure how this can be a FOP issue, but Ive never seen it with PDFs from any other source, so Ive tried to investigate further.p  pOur application creates PDFs via xslfo, using FOP. This has worked great for a couple of years  occasionally a user will have trouble printing a specific document, and see a very particular type of corruption, wherein most characters are incremented. That is to say, 1 becomes 2, M becomes N, period becomes a slash, and the word invoice becomes the mildly amusing jowpjdf. The document displays fine typically in Adobe Reader. Weve generally worked around it, but now an even odder case presents itself.p  pA new addition to our application creates 2 substantially similar PDFs created with FOP, then concatenates them using Perls PDFReuse to grab the files from the filesystem and create a new document, which is then sent to the user by email. User opens document fine in Reader, hits print, and something new happens... Page 1 prints perfectly, but page 2 is corrupt in exactly the manner described above.p  pIf it was a consistent print driver issue, Id expect to see both pages corrupted. If it was a FOP issue, likewise. If it was a PDFReuse issue, Id expect to see more fundamental breakage, and this breakage is not new since we started concatenating documents. Im at a loss where to investigate next.p  pHas anyone seen similar corruption in PDFs, especially when generating using Apache FOPp  pstrongtldr PDFs created using FOP sometimes print with every character shifted by 1, e.g. AB, 34strongp

Negative 342 pI am in the process of building an application suite that requires a Web Server to run on OS X to receive HTTP requests from an iOS device or any web enabled device really. Once a request is received, the server application will then query a MySQL database, format the result into XML and return the result to the iOS application. Building the iOS app and an OS X application to query MySQL is not an issue, but I have no idea how to build the Web Server part i.e. having a Cocoa application listening for incoming requests etc. Is it a good idea to somehow use Apache as the Web Server If so how do I do this i.e. Apache modules, PERL bridging to Cocoa If not, what are the alternatives This application if successfully will potentially have many users so the Web Server must be secure hence the reason of looking into Apache. p

Negative 342 pI asked this question before a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9533150isthereanysecuritywithsuphpherea but user a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1820cheekysoftCheekySofta pointed out that I was  asking how to implement my emproposed solutionem where instead I should just state my problem and ask for solution ideas. So here goes.p  pOn the linux server I have the files set up like sop  precodehome   user1   [rwx]  index.html   [rwx]  index.php   user2      [rwx]  index.html      [rwx]  index.php codepre  pIf I have Apache virtual hosts set up at p  precodeltDirectory homeuser1gt ltDirectory homeuser2gt codepre  pThen [any] user can go to codewww.example.comuser1index.htmlcode or codewww.example.comuser2index.htmlcode. However, the permissions on those files are code0700code, therefore, they are inaccessible over the web. It is for this reason that I am using suPHP.p  pFor the sake of argument, lets say codeindex.phpcode has only the following in itp  pstrongindex.phpstrongp  precodeltphp echo filegetcontentsindex.html exit gt  codepre  pNow, with suPHP set up, user1 can go to  codewww.example.comuser1index.phpcode to view codeindex.htmlcode. Likewise, user2 can go to  codewww.example.comuser2index.phpcode to view codeindex.htmlcode. However, user1 can strongalsostrong go to codewww.example.comuser2index.phpcode to view user2s codeindex.htmlcode page, and vice versa for user2.p  pThe natural way to deal with this is through a hrefhttpnet.tutsplus.comarticlesnewshowtobuildaloginsystemforasimplewebsite relnofollowPHP sessionsa. All requests to a page are redirected to a main page ie. codewww.facebook.comcode, the user is validated against the database, and then redirected to the correct page see image below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoFDVa.jpg altUser Interaction diagramp  pThe users would go to a page ie. codewww.example.compage1.htmlcode, and then there would be a portion of page 1 stronghard codedstrong to ensure a valid session exists. If it exists, the page is loaded. If it does not exist, the user is redirected to, in this case, codeindex.htmlcode. After they login and a valid session is established, they are redirected back to the original page. We can modify codeindex.phpcode to carry this outp  pstrongindexValidate.phpstrongp  precodeltphp this is purely pseudo code, I cant guarantee it will work sessionstart requireonce SessionValidator.php sv  new SessionValidator svgtvalidateun, pwd  echo filegetcontentsindex.html exit gt codepre  pHowever, In my design, these pages codepage1.htmlcode, codepage2.htmlcode... are in the users own directory codeindex.htmlcode, codeindex.phpcode, therefore, the server cant demand that they have this hard coded section checking for a valid section. The user can simply edit the file to remove out this section. Of course this would be stupid on the users part, but I dont want the user to have to modify every single one of their files to have a session check section at the top. I want this to be seamless. p  pA few notesp  ol liI can use Apache to redirect strongallstrong requests to a single codevalidateUser.phpcode script which, validates the user then, if valid, calls the original script requested.

Negative 342 pCan i have threads inside map function I have a task were having threads could really help me. I need to concurrently add values to a hashmap for every input line. My input line becomes an array of string and for every value of this array, i need to add it to the hash map. I later use this hashmap in the cleanup function.p  pI am doing this with a for loop and it seems that is the bottleneck for my project. So i thought of using a concurrent hash map and splitting the array of strings into several smaller arrays. So every thread would be responsible for adding the corresponding smaller array inside the hashmap. The thing is that i have implement it in a local java application and it works. When i use it inside hadoop, the results are not the ones expected. I am using Thread.join for every thread so that for every line of input i make sure that the threads have finished before the next line. Well that is what i thought i did. Does hadoop treats threads with a special wayp  precode   edits for duffymo codepre  pHere is the google citation a hrefhttpresearch.google.compubspub36296.html relnofollowhttpresearch.google.compubspub36296.htmla .p  pAlgorithm 2 is the part that i am talking about. As you can see there is a for loop for every attribute and that for every attribute i need to update the in memory structure. They only have to predict one value in their approach single label learning, were in mine i might have many values to predict multi label learning. So what google says y value, for them is a 3 value array. For me it might be up to thousands. Aggregating two 3dimension vectors is a lot faster than aggregating two 10000dimension vectors.p  pIf i put only a single label in my algorithm, i have no problem at all. The 45 seconds i mentioned, are reduced to less than 5. So yes, it is working correctly for one label only.p  pThe 45 seconds i mentioned are for the forloop only. I didnt count the parsing and all the other things. The for loop is the bottleneck for sure since this is the only thing that i am timing and it takes about 45 seconds, while the whole task takes about 1 minute including task initialization and many more. I want to try and brake that forloop into 2 or 3 smaller for loops and process them concurrently. Trying means that it might work and that it might not work. Sometimes crazy stuff like the one i mentioned, could be a necessity. Well that is  what a well respected programmer told me in a previous thread of mine about hadoop.p  pI didnt provide these many details earlier, since i thought that i only wanted an opinion about hadoop and threads inside the map function. Didnt think that someone would question me so much P.p

Otherwise, here goes.p  pYou have x number of objects in space, which have bounding coordinates p0 and p1. p0 and p1 are each 3 dimensional coordinates and p0 always has the lower values  whether negative or positive, and p1 always has the higher values.p  pNow, you have a plane, which is perfectly orthogonal to the direction of camera C, which has a position pC and a heading hC. This plane can then be defined as being 90 degrees pi2 radians from the cameras yaw sometimes called heading and pitch and extending unto the furthest defined bounds in the space.p  pBecause I do not permit more than 180 degrees FOV, anything which lies completely behind the camera behind the plane of exclusion must be excluded.p  pIs there a simple way to do this For this question, I do not treat the issue of having to check against every object in the space assume for the purpose of our question that there are always a limited number of objects  managed by partitioning the space in some fashion  so that the objects we check against are always questionable.p  pAlso keep in mind that because these are not points but pairs of points representing 3d bounding cubes, it is not enough for a point to lie on this or that side of the plane.p  pI get the feeling there is a simple way to do this, but not having taken Computer Graphics I was never introduced to the math.p

Negative 342 pI am new to Android and Java. I am building an app that allows users to push a button which launches an image chooser where they can select from images on the sd card. The app loads with a grid view with 2 cells. One cell has an image view that has a default image. The other is the button. Once, the image is chosen, the image view needs to be displayed in the Image View of the Grid View.p  pI am using a string path that is being decoded from the images uri to create a bitmap. I then am calling imageView.setImageBitmapbitmap. This is doing nothing. I have tried updating the image resource with a different image in the drawable folders and still nothing. I added a seperate image view just under the grid in my activity, and that image is updating fine which leads me to believe that this has to do with the grid view this is my first grid view.p  pAny help is very much appreciated.p  pThank you.p
Negative 342 pIm having a little trouble figuring out how to do an action when submiting a form, but before it is sent.

Negative 342 pIm new at using Play Framework 2.0 I am using Scala and have a question about sessions.p  pI come from a Ruby on Rails background, so I tend to think of everything that I learn in Play Framework with respect to Ruby on Rails.p  pWith that in mind, is there any way for me to call stuff stored in the Session while I am in the viewp  pIf I have hello  world stored in the Session, I want to be able to do something like session.gethello and be able to use world in the view. Is this possiblep  pThe other option I see is to store the value in a variable in the controller, and pass that along to the view by doing something like OK var , but that way seems kind of clunky especially if I start using more variables.p  pThanksp

Negative 342 pCaveat I am new to C and SQL less than 2 months with C and 6 months with SQLp  pI have been working on this for a few days, and I am beginning to think I am asking the impossible.p  pI have two local databases.  The first is a Temp database that receives data from a third party.  This data is in XML format and does have duplicate records in it.p  pI insert the data into the Temp database and then would like to use INSERT INTO.. to move the unique records into the Final database.p  pI have created and tested the insert into sql and it works with no problems.  Here is an examplep  precodeINSERT INTO Final.dbo.RDATA C1, C2,.. SELECT distinct     C1, C2, ...

I have even tried creating a Synonym for Final.dbo.RDATA, and replaced that in the query  again in SQL Express it also works.

Negative 342 pIs there way to copy a file into Plone with WebDAV and have Plone register it as an Event file rather than a simple pagep  pI would very much like to use Plone for its standard CMS properties which are brilliant but I cant spend time programming up an application in Plone  its way too complicated.  The Plan is to generate information in another system and use scripts to export it into Plone  hence copying via WebDAV would be a perfect solution if these generated files could be recognized as Events.  If not an alternative, still using WebDAV, would be to generate and copy a python script, that uses API calls to create the events.  Though Im not sure where to copy and what API calls to make.

Negative 342 pSo my basic 2d game framework in SlimDX is going well. Ive created a custom Sprite object, and have some rudimentary mastery of rendering sprites.

There is no fixed pattern of words and numbers in the strings, and there may be more than one multidigit number in a string.p  pThe only place Ive seen this done routinely is in the Mac OSs Finder, which sorts filenames containing mixed numbers and words naturally, placing 20 after 3, not before it.p  pThe collation order desired would be produced by an algorithm that split each string into blocks at letternumber boundaries, then ordered each part, treating letterblocks with normal collation and numberblocks as integers for collation purposes. Sop  pcodeAAA2fredcode would become codeAAA,2,fredcode and codeAAA10bobcode would become codeAAA,10,bobcode. These can then be sorted as desiredp  precoderegress WITH dat AS  VALUES AAA,2,fred, AAA,10,bob  regress SELECT dat FROM dat ORDER BY dat      dat         AAA,2,fred  AAA,10,bob 2 rows codepre  pas compared to the usual string collation orderingp  precoderegress WITH dat AS  VALUES AAA2fred, AAA10bob  regress SELECT dat FROM dat ORDER BY dat     dat        AAA10bob  AAA2fred 2 rows codepre  pHowever, the record comparison approach doesnt generalize because Pg wont compare ROW.. constructs or records of unequal numbers of entries.p  pGiven the sample data a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com12c17001in this SQLFiddlea the default enAU.UTF8 collation produces the orderingp  precode1A, 10A, 2A, AAA10B, AAA11B, AAA1BB, AAA20B, AAA21B, X10C10, X10C2, X1C1, X1C10, X1C3, X1C30, X1C4, X2C1 codepre  pbut I wantp  precode1A, 2A, 10A, AAA1BB, AAA10B, AAA11B, AAA20B, AAA21B, X1C1, X1C3, X1C4, X1C10, X1C30, X2C1, X10C10, X10C2 codepre  pIm working with PostgreSQL 9.1 at the moment, but 9.2only suggestions would be fine. Im interested in advice on how to achieve an efficient stringsplitting method, and how to then compare the resulting split data in the alternating stringthennumber collation described. Or, of course, on entirely different and better approaches that dont require splitting strings.p  pPostgreSQL doesnt seem to support comparator functions, otherwise this could be done fairly easily with a recursive comparator and something like codeORDER USING comparatorfncode and a codecomparatortext,textcode function.

Negative 342 pI would like to make a backup copy of my Core Data database, without using either the File Manager to make a copy of the sqlite file, or using the Persistent Store Coordinators migratePersistentStore method for reasons that are too long to explain here. What I want to do is to open a new persistent store with the same MOMD as the original file, create a new Managed Object Context, then iterate over all the objects in my database and insert them into the new context. p  pThis will work for simple entities, but the problem is that my model has about 20 entities, many of them with onetomany and manytomany relationships. The slightly more complex solution would be to insert every object into the new MOC, and then hold all the new Managed Objects in memory and use them to tie up all the relationships between the objects in a subsequent passes. But it seems like a really messy solution.p  pIs there a clean, elegant way to achieve this, that might work for any kind of data model, not just a customized solution for my own model, and without having to hold every object in memory at the same time p  pThanks.p

Negative 342 pIm planning a product that will process updates from multiple data feeds. Inputdata is guesstimated to be a total of 100Mbps stream containing 100 byte sized messages. These messages contain several data fields that needs to be checked for correlation with the existing data set within the application. If a inputmessage correlates with an existing data record, then the inputmessage will update the existing datarecord, if not it will create a new record. It is assumed that data are updated every 3 seconds in average. p  pThe correlation process is assumed to be a bottleneck, and thus I intend to make our product able to run balanced in multiple processes if needed most likely on a separate hardware or VM. Somewhat in the vicinity of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSpacebasedarchitecture relnofollowSpacebased architecturea. Id then like a shared storage between my processes so that all existing data records are visible to all the running processes. The shared storage will have to fetch possible candidates for correlation through a querysearch based on some attributes e.g. elevation. It will have to offer configuring warm redundancy, and a possibility to store snapshots every 5 minutes for logging.p  pEverything seems to be pointing towards MongoDB, but Id like a confirmation from you that MongoDB will meet my needs. So do you think it is a go Thank youp  pNB I am not considering a relational database because we want to focus all coding in our application, instead of having to make stored proceduresfunctions in a separate environment to optimize the performance of our system. Further, the data is diverse and I dont want to try normalize it into a schema. p

Negative 342 pI have a sublayer keyframe animation defined to animate an image along a BSpline, grouped together with a rotate animation. With the sublayer.speed set to 0, I can drag the image back and forth along the curve by adjusting the animationsGroup.timeOffset value based on the distance dragged. What I want to do is, after a certain threshold say 15 is to set the animation speed to 1 so the animation completes by itself, but its not that simple. The animation either completes immediately and resets everything back to the start position, or the animiation reaches the end of the path, loops round to zero, and continues animating until its back to the point where the animation kicks in.p  pWhat I want isp  pTstart    drag    T0.15    animation     Tendp  pBut what Im getting isp  pTstart    drag    T0.15    animation     Tend  Tstart  T0.15p  pIve already looked into use of timeOffset and timewarps, and fiddled with the parameters but to no avail.p

But how on earth do I go about strongaccessingstrong that data again which essentially just seems like the reverse of this process.p  pIn pseudocode what Im trying to do is something likep  precode select video track 2 ... call up the first image in the sequence ... access and note its onscreen duration setting ... call up the second image ... access and note its duration ... ... repeat until done. codepre  pp  pIm not after editing this data or anything  just finding out how I can get access to individual frames in a video track ... and where the strongHECKstrong this timing info is hiding inside the bowels of QT.p  pAs a senior citizen I think Im starting to get too old for this sort of thing and Quicktime is a big, often complex and confusing framework, so if anyone can help me out with some advice or ideally just a few lines of sample code here Id really appreciate it. Thanks in advance p

Negative 342 pI find myself faced with a conundrum of which the answer probably falls outside of my expertise.  Im hoping someone can help.p  pI have an optimised and efficient query for fetching table and linked data, the actual contents of which are unimportant.  However upon each read that data then needs to be processed to present the data in JSON format.  As were talking typical examples where a few hundred rows could have a few hundredthousand associated rows this takes time.  With multithreading and a powerful CPU i7 3960X this processing is around 400ms  800ms at 100 CPU.  Its not a lot I know but why process it each time in the first placep  pIn this particular example, although everything Ive ever read points to not doing so as I understood it Im considering storing the computed JSON in a VARCHARMAX column for fast reading.p  pWhy Well the data is read 100 times or more for every single write change, it seems to me that given those numbers it would be far better to stored the JSON for optimised retrieval and recompute and update it on the odd occasion the associations are changed  adding perhaps 10 to 20 ms to the time taken to write changes, but improving the reads by some large factor.p  pYour opinions on this would be much appreciated.p

Negative 342 pThis problem has hit me multiple times.

That way, I could achieve a cool looking loading button that ran some long running task, becoming grayed out and disabled, but have his inhouse ProgressBar remain clearly visible with all the bright colors attached. But when I disable the button, the precious child ProgressBar become disabled and grayed out too.p  pAnd today again I hit the same problem. I have two a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenecontrolAccordion.html relnofollowcodeAccordionscodea stacked sequentially after each other. The top Accordion features two a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenecontrolTitledPane.html relnofollowcodeTitledPanescodea, that the user can expand or contract at will. However, the Accordion below has only one TitledPane that is always expanded. This TitledPane features content and controls always visible to the user. I wrapped all of this fixed content in an separate Accordion and a separate TitledPane so that he could melt in with the same look and feel as his cousins. Just putting in a regular a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenelayoutPane.html relnofollowcodePanecodea or something, then trying to mimic the cousins styles was a real hassle.

Negative 342 pIve been working on ASP.NET for just over a year now, and Ive come upon an interesting thought that Id like feedback on.p  pIve noticed that Literal controls save their text value in the viewstate.

This seems to me to to achieve the same thing as literal control without the viewstate bloat provided you need to wrap your content within a tag anyway.

Now that Ive upgraded Im worrying Ill see problems.p  pstrongQuestion strong So, in Android SDK, can I enter Sony SDK in API17API18 or will I need to simply wait for Sony to update the SDKp  pI have had a look, I just dont know if Sony are slow at this or if Im missing something in the process Sony SDK instructions are only for API16 and the entry only appears in API16 in Android SDK managerp

Negative 342 pThis is my first time posting here, but I have found this site an invaluable repository for many years.p  pI have recently been adding tooltips to a website form. Initially, my concern was to make these work when a mouseuser hovers over the tooltip icon in my case simply . I was using the following CSSp  precode.tooltip  borderbottom 1px dotted 000000 color 000000  outline none cursor help  textdecoration none position relative   .tooltip span  marginleft 999em position absolute   .tooltiphover span, .tooltipfocus span  borderradius 5px 5px  mozborderradius 5px  webkitborderradius 5px border 1px solid 000000  fontfamily Arial, Helvetica, sansserif important position absolute  left 1em  top 2em  zindex 99 marginleft 0  width 250px backgroundcolor b4e0e0 fontsize 1em   .ttipcontent   padding 0.8em 1em  codepre  pWith the following HTMLp  precodelta classtooltip hrefgtltspan classttipcontentgtThis is the tooltip content which will be displayedltspangtltagt codepre  pThis worked well enough for the intended use, creating onhover tooltips for use with a mouse pointer device. However, to use this with a touchscreen device was a nightmare. Every time you clicked the  icon, you were of course taken to the top of the page. p  pSo I replaced the HTML with the following keeping the same CSSp  precodeltspan classtooltipgtltspan classttipcontentgtThis is the tooltip content which will be displayedltspangtltspangt codepre  pThis now works well with both mouse pointer devices and touchscreen devices. However, I have inadvertently removed the ability of a user to keyboardnavigate to the tooltips by tabbing through the links. This poses an accessibility problem. p  pMy question is, is there a way to combine all three elements of functionality the ability to display tooltips on hover, on touch, and by keyboard navigation p  pThanks in advance for any helpp
Negative 342 pIn my previous question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18168040forloopfunctionsinpythonnoredirect1comment2663598518168040For Loop Functions in Pythona, I had trouble with putting functions that contained a command to draw a line for a hangman game. It didnt exactly draw the line, and I first suspected it was a problem with the for loop or the functions. Now I realize there is somewhat a glitch with Pygame.p  pI have tried solving the problem by using this code in the country, CANADAp  precodeb2  font.renderstrletters[1], True, red screen.blitb2, bPosition if hangman1x  500 and hangman1y  500     hangman1x  775, 250     hangman1y  775, 50     pygame.draw.linescreen, black, hangman1x, hangman1y, 5     pygame.display.flip     time.sleep0.5     bPosition  500, 500     b1.x, b1.y  500, 500 if hangman1x  775, 250 and hangman1y  775, 50     print hi     width  6     pygame.draw.linescreen, black, hangman1x, hangman1y, 5     print yay     pygame.display.flip codepre  pNow heres the weird thing.p  pWhen you press the B blitted onto the screen, it turns red, like its meant to, draws the line perfectly fine, but disappears, when the B disappears, and I understand why. After that, I added that extra if code. Notice that both codepygame.draw.linecodes are the same,  It prints hi and yay in the shell, but it does not keep the line. Anyway to solve thisp
Negative 342 pOK  this is a very oddball scenario, and I am having problems trying to get to the bottom of it.p  pI have 2 applications lets just say app1 and app2 and a text file txt1.br App1 and txt1 reside in the same directory say CAPP, but app2 resides in a subdirectory of app1s directory CAPPSUB.p  pWhen App1 launches, it reads some stuff from txt1 using the standardp  precodeAssignFiletxtFile,txt1.txt ResettxtFile codepre  pNo issues with that. However, when App2 launches App1 via a shellexecute commandp  precodeshellexecute0,open,..app1.exe,nil,nil,SWSHOW codepre  pApp1 cannot seem to see the text file.  I get a response saying Specified File Could Not Be Found.  Odd.p  pI did debug by addingp  precodeif not fileexiststxt1.txt then showMessageExtractFilePathapplication.exename codepre  pAnd this shows the correct file path of app1 itself, so, why then, does the reset command produce the Could not find.... error  I am wondering if employing shellexecute is making the application somehow think it is executing from the subdirectory as opposed to the actual directory that it is inp  pI understand that the easiest solution is to simply add the file path to the front of every file my app1 is opening I tried it and yes, it does work correctly, however, there are in reality, hundreds of files this main application accesses through a similar method be they txt, ini or dlls i.e. assigning the file based on the fact it is in the same directory as the application, therefore, not setting the fully qualified file path, so changing and maintaining them all is not something we would be interested in doing at this time.p  pHas anyone ever seen something like this before  Is there a better way for me to have App2 launch App1 other than ShellExecute  There are no parameters or anything to be passed to App1, I just need it to launch.p  pThanks for your time  let me know if you need anything else on this onep

Negative 342 pI am understanding the implementation of CFS in the Linux kernel. My doubt is when the CFS calculates the ideal time for each task in a given epoch and a ideal time of a task is lower than mingranularity. What place in the code can I find the checking this scenariop  pAssume the target latency is 6 miliseconds ms and the miminum granularity is 0.75 ms this is default values and two runnable tasks. One of them task 0 has a nice 20 weight 88761 and other task 1 has a nice 0 weight 1024.  p  pThe ideal time of task 0 is 5.93 ms 887618876110246 and the ideal time of task 1 is 0.068 ms  10248876110246. The calculation is done by the function checkpreempttick in each interrupt tick.  p  pThe ideal time of task 1 is lower than mingranularity. If CFS assigns mingranularity to task 1, the target latency is larger than 6 ms. Do you know how to work CFS in this situation p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 342 pI am trying to write a Java program that takes an arithmetic expression, converts it from Infix to Postfix and evaluates the answer. However, I need to represent the expressions as Polynomials with the help of Linked Lists and perform Postfix evaluation on them. I have completed the Infix to Postfix conversion and know how to evaluate Postfix. But I am struggling to represent the polynomial expression using Linked List.p  pFor example, if the Postfix expression is   strong40 50 strongp  pI need to store strong40strong as strong4101  0101strong in a Linked List. It can be done by having 2 nodes, Coefficient and Exponent, in the Linked List. Same thing for 50. p  pThe problem is, I dont know how many linked lists Ill need for any given expression. If the postfix expression is   strong40 50 60  strong    then I need to store all 3 numbers in separate lists and  store them in a stack till I find an operator. Can anyone please give me any suggestions on how to proceedp

The trouble is the textarea should display the description for the code entered in the option value, again taken from the database, but without button and so I cant use the post method when I select the codart by the option value, the textarea should automatically show me the corresponding description taken by sql db.

Negative 342 pI just want to start out this post by saying that I am not a programmer, nor do I play one on TV.  I have found this site because I have been trying to manage our Magento instance, after pretty much left high and dry by the developers we had building this for us.  I will try and explain it the best I can belowp  pWhen we apply a shopping cart coupon to the sales order, and the discount is applied to each item, a new line item total is configured by Magento.  We then have a connector that takes the information from Magentos API and it is then connected to Open Bravo, which is our ERP accounting software.  Open Bravo is grabbing the information as it normally does, however it doesnt see the discount information, so the order total is different in our accounting program then what Magento has.  Open Bravo is teling me they need to know where the discounted amount on the sales order in Magento is on the API.  Its obviously in a different spot then the standard sales order amount.p  pI might be able to describe a little better if you hit me with questions.  Any help you could provide would be highly appreciated.  Maybe we could barter for some office supplies, as that is what we sell.p  pThanksp

Negative 342 pI used nvprof and nvidiasmi to monitor the GPU power dissipation respectively, but observed different results, summarized in the table below.p  precode gpu                  busy                        idle          model     nvprof[Watt]  smi[Watt]     nvprof[Watt]  smi[Watt]   M2090      151           151           100          75 K20        105           102           63           43  codepre  pnote 0 busy means my code is running on the monitored GPUp  pnote 1 nvprof reports the power for all the devices. So my way to get the idle power using nvprof for a specific GPU is simply to have the code running on another GPU.p  pnote 2 nvidiasmi reports a couple of different quantities about power, but I was focusing on power drawp  pnote 3 cuda version 5.5p  pSo my question is why is the power reported by nvidiasmi generally smaller than nvprof, and why does this discrepancy become larger when the idle power is monitored and ultimately, which utility should I trust morep  pAlso, just to make sure, does the power that the two utilies measure refer to the input electric power PIU rather than the output thermal power, rightp  pThanks a lot for any advice p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong njuffa and talonmies s speculation makes very good sense. So I explored smi a little bit more for power analysis. The results, however, do not make sense to me.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Azja.png altenter image description herep  padditional notesp  ol lipThe discontinuity of the red data is because I directly used the timestamp reported by smi, which has low resolution sec. Besides, for illustration purpose p0 is assigned an numerical value of 20 and p1 of 10. So for most of the time, the GPU is put into its full performance state this is strongoddstrong, except for the busy case, where the GPU somehow drops to p1 during 1518s strongoddstrong.pli lipIt is not until 21.3s that cudaSetDevice is invoked for the very first time. So the power rise and pstate change that occurs at 18s is rather strongoddstrong.pli lipbusy power is measured when my GPU code is set to the background, and smi put into an infinite loop to query the power and pstate repeatedly until the background process terminates. idle power is measured simply by launching smi 50 times. Apparently in the latter case, smi exhibits larger overhead, which is again, strongoddstrong.pli ol

Negative 342 pWhat is the best way to detect a mouseDown, drag and mouseUp event in JavaScript where nothing is actually draggedp  pI want to use drag inputs in a website where the user clicks and drags but nothing is actually dragged as far as the DOM goes.p  pWhen I click and drag in the browser sometimes the mouseUp is not detected. Also sometimes if the user clicks on some content, the content is picked up and dragged in Firefox, though I wonder this might be a browser specific issue. I want to somehow stop this behaviour.p  pAlso in Chrome I have noticed that I get a page like icon sometimes when dragging. Which I would also like to prevent. DevelopmentTest OS is Ubuntu.p  pHow best can I track drags with the mouse and also prevent these strange browser issues and have reliable mouseUp events as these seem to fail intermittentlyp

Negative 342 pI am now entering Kinetic and it has made it far easier for me to draw on canvas. However, building a game app, I need to clear the rectangle on every animation request. Theyre controlled by an fps cap script, but still, there are about 50 updates per second.p  pKinetics code.removeChildrencode method not only clears the canvas, it deletes the canvas node from the DOM. Doing so not only makes DOM queries inconsistent by intervals of .02 second, but also drops my FPS rate by about 60 in comparison to stock HTML5 canvas handling on every machine I ran the game on.p  pIs there a KineticJS method for clearing the canvas in a manner such as codeclearRectcodesp  h2Edith2  pI have also made sure its not a problem on any other part of the program. Call stack doesnt overflow, the FPS drop is just due to DOM changing twice every .02 second.p  h2Edit 2h2  pI have tried the followingp  ul liIgnore the layer before and create a blank rectangle to fill up the visible part of the canvas. It dropped my frame rate to about 14 FPSli liUse the code.clearcode method. It solved the DOM consistency problem but the frame rate got even lower than before.li ul  pIt seems the only solution would be calling the default HTML5 codeclearRectcode method, but that would mean creating the canvas element by hand and possibly making Kinetic useless as a library for my app.p  h2Edit 3h2  pAs for the app, Ive started using standard HTML5 canvas since I have a deadline. Id still like to see a Kinetic solution though  it might be helpful in the future. It surprises me to see such a simple thing is so hard, if not impossible, in a popular library like KineticJS.p

Negative 342 pI want to fetch blobs from database and stream the result via codeStreamingOutputcode to client. However, besides just blob data I also need to fetch some metadata for instance, file name is metadata and file content is blob. Ive designed my data access layer method to return function that accepts codeConnectioncode and returns codeInputStreamcode p  precodedef fooid String Connection gt InputStream codepre  pWhen I construct the response object I pass codeStreamingOutputcode to it and in codeStreamingOutputcodes write method I call codefoocode passing connection to it. p  pThe mentioned metadata should be placed in response headers. p  pI thought about modifying codefoocode method to return not just codeConnection gt InputStreamcode, but a codeConnection gt InputStream, Stringcode. But I cant set headers of response object in StreamingOutputs write method. So, Ive come up with adding another method to return just metadata for given input parameters. But I think there can be problems in such a solution. In that case there are two transactions one for fetching metadata and another for fetching blob.p  pI need advise what is a common approach in such situations. I dont want to return blob not in codeStreamingOutputcodep

Negative 342 pI am working on a project which is a sort of file uploader. In the project, there are certain log files which are created by an application and saved in a particular folder. The content of these files is always text. The contents of these files are uploaded to the server and this task is done by a windows service. The service  reads the files one by one and then transfer their contents to the server.p  pEarlier this task used to be done by the application itself. But it was separated from application because it is possible that when the application is running the user is offline. So these files will remain pending for upload.p  pThe advantage of using service is obvious that the user doesnt have to worry about upload thing. Whenever the user is connected to internet the service will take care of it.p  pNow the requirement is that when service uploads the contents of the file and the application via which the files are created is running at that time, the service should send a message to the application that which files content is being uploaded.p  pNow the problem is that the service and the application are not communicating.

Negative 342 pI am working on a C API that is used by a variety of consumers. This API provides access to a shared resource in my case hardware that does serial communication , that will often have a few different actors trying to use it concurrently.p  pThe issue I have is that some of my consumers will want to use this in a multithreaded environment  each actor works independently and try to use the resource. A simple lock works fine here. But some of my consumers would prefer to use asyncawait and timeslice the resource. As I understand it this requires an asynchronous lock to yield the timeslice back to other tasks blocking at a lock would halt that whole thread.p  pAnd I imagine that having serial locks is unperformant at best, and a potential race condition or deadlock at worst.p  pSo how can I protect this shared resource in a common codebase for both potential concurrency usagesp

Negative 342 pTwo columns, separate sheets, each have part number in them.  Column1 is updated and Column2 is copied from Column1 before Column1 is updated to retain associated row values and information per part number.  Now if Column1 is updated and the row counts between Column1 and Column2 dont match anymore,  I cannot find anything on comparing columns with different row counts where duplicates occur.  How can I compare the columns and if there is a duplicate, take the duplicate row from Column2 and copy it to Column1 where the duplicate occurredsame part number  Like if before Column1 was updated there was a part number 2222 in cell A1, so that data would be copied over to Column2 to A1.  After the update of Column1 the part number 2222 might be in A8 now.  Now the row counts dont match between columns, so I cannot do row count, and I cannot just copy a range over from one sheet to the other.  Any help would be much appreciated. p  precodeSub DeleteRowsandCopyRowstoduplicate  Deletes rows where one cell does not meet criteria  Dim ws1 As Worksheet Set ws1  ActiveWorkbook.Sheetsmachine schedule Dim ws2 As Worksheet Set ws2  ActiveWorkbook.SheetsSync Data Dim criteria As String Dim found As Range Dim i As Long  Application.ScreenUpdating  False  For i  60 To 3 Step 1    criteria  ws2.Cellsi, 1.Value    On Error Resume Next    Set found  ws1.RangeAA.FindWhatcriteria, LookAtxlWhole    On Error GoTo 0 If found Is Not Nothing Then     ws2.Cellsi, 1.EntireRow.Copy Destination not sure what to put here because its always changing  If found Is Nothing Then      ws2.Cellsi, 1.EntireRow.ClearContents  or .Delete    End If    Next i  Application.ScreenUpdating  True  End Sub codepre

Negative 342 pI have a data migration service that reads stuff from one database in chunks then migrates it into another database.p  pTo work through the Chunks of data I am trying to use a RecursiveAction and fork join pool.

Negative 342 pThere is a .NET application written in c sharp which requires communication with a .asmx WebService upon registration.

The only way to get the script to display the caption and title, is to pan to another slide and back to slide 0.

Negative 342 pI am trying to create 2 onetoone relationships between derived classes of a common base and an unrelated class, so that when I delete the parent row the child rows in the database get deleted.

EF creates foreign keys on the parent table OtherType for each referenced DerivedType with DELETE CASCADE. On the child table TPH  BaseTypes it creates one foreign key with DELETE RESTRICT. I would expect that the last two lines in my code would create the desired foreign keys with DELETE CASCADE.

Inner exception message Saving or accepting changes failed because more than one entity of type EF6.CodeFirst.TPC.Model.SecondConcreteType have the same primary key value. Ensure that explicitly set primary key values are unique. Ensure that databasegenerated primary keys are configured correctly in the database and in the Entity Framework model. Use the Entity Designer for Database FirstModel First configuration. Use the HasDatabaseGeneratedOption fluent API or DatabaseGeneratedAttribute for Code First configuration. codepre  pNow as for how the solution to this unfortunate situation should look like I have a pretty good notion.  When using TableperClassStrategy TPC one has to handle generation of primary keys himherself so EF does not get confused when you have two exact same primary keys for what are completely unrelated tables at the database level but which share a common base class at the EF level. The proposed way in the first URL I linked unfortunately does not alleviate this issue since the foreign keys on my codeDerivedTypecodeObjects will end up being the same here no matter what since they reference the primary key on the codeOtherTypescodeTable which obviously will be the same for a distinct record in that table. Thats the issue.p  pThe solution I assume would involve two additional columns in the codeOtherTypescode table each of those being the target of one of the foreign keys on the codeDerivedTypescode tables. But I absolutely do not know how to implement that in EF. Whatever I tried so far usually ended up with some exception about how you can only have hierarchy independent associations for the most derived types which in fact are codeDerivedTypeAcode and codeDerivedTypeBcode or other validation exceptions complaining about the multiplicity having to be codemanycode on one of the relationship ends.p  pI must point out that the kind of model I created is exactly what I need since I am working within a larger model that uses a recursive marshalling system and AutoMapper to map between the two layers. That said I would like to ask you to find a solution for the proposed model and not come up with a different kind of model or workarounds where I deviate from the codezero..one to onecode mapping.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pI was bloody fed up with EF6s trouble to create associations from derived classes within an inheritance hierarchy to other unrelatedintype classes so I went ahead and completely rewrote my data model to exclude any sort of hierarchy no TPHTPTTPC. I was done in about 5 hours complete with all mappings using fluent api and seeding for the whole span of tables.

Negative 342 pIm working with an android app where i receive a json based response from a webservice.

This creates an ascii file A.mat which starts likep  precode Created by Octave 3.8.1, Tue May 27 121253 2014 CEST ltremidesktopgt  name values  type matrix  rows 25  columns 5  43.0656 6.752420000000001 68.39323 35.75617 98.85446 ... codepre  pI run the algorithm using octave and save the output matrix codeBcode similarly.p  pIn my C code, I load the matrices A and B using the following piece of codep  precode I opened the file A.mat with stdifstream infilefilename  and read the first lines starting by  and loaded the matrix dimensions stdstring buffer double matBuffer  new double[rowscols] while stdgetlineinfile, buffer    stdistringstream issbuffer   while iss gtgt matBuffer      matBuffer     codepre  pThen I run the C code with the values read from A.mat, and compare the results with the values read from B.mat by computing the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMeansquarederror relnofollowmean squared errorMSEa on the coeff of B read vs B computed.p  pHowever, with such a design, can I expect that the MSE be 0 between the C and octave code Of course I do the computation on octave and C with the same machine.

Negative 342 pI need to implement citrix connection through my own application. The situation is such that currently connects via a web browser with name and password and after completing Citrix XenApp send me sms code that I enter into the browser will be redirected to page with the applications that can run.p  pI suppose that if I identify in this way , it will connect to XenApp act as a VPN network and will have access to applications the internal corporate web over the PC .p  pNeeded to process the data programmatically from a web application that I can run after connecting to XenApp , but if I make web request from my application to specify URL, so the URL does not exist.p  pI found on the Citrix Web site that exists PowerShell SDK, but unfortunately I could not find out how and whether it is even possible to connect this way.p  pThe point is that the application is a classic WinForms programming in . NET 4.0. After connecting to the Citrix should download from fixed URL address the file and save it to the disk. After processing by user in application too via a web service that file again to send it back.p  pDoes anyone know how I can achieve that with the application to connect to XenApp and had access to internal web applications p  pThank you so much for your advice , or assistance with directions, which way to go.p

Negative 342 pWhen an application process launches an XPC helper process, it doesnt actually do the forkexec itself in the classic UNIX style. Instead, it sends a message to launchd, which does the dirty work for it. Thus, if you query the parent process on the XPC process, it comes back as the launchd process.p  pHowever, if you open Activity Monitor in the hierarchical process view, the XPC helper processes are all shown below the original application that requested them, for examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5OOGE.png altExample of XPC helper for Safari showing launchd as parent processp  pIn the software Im working on, knowing this relationship between processes would be extremely useful.

Negative 342 pIm somewhat familiar with the mobile PayPal api for iOS, but Im a bit confused on a bit of functionality Id like to integrate.p  pIm working on an app where individuals can accept payments from others within the app, however I dont want the receivers of funds to have to provide the app with an application id  secret created from their applications section in the paypal developers section as its overly complicated and a big barrier for the sake of what needs to be accomplished. The preferred way would be retrieving the access token  secret automatically for the user through an oauth style login  which Im not able to find if paypal supports this, at least via mobile.p  pAll I need, is to be able to setup a way for one paypal user to send payment to another paypal user within my application using PayPals api, preferably without requiring the receiver to manually provide their idsecret tokens.

Negative 342 pI need some advice on how to implement this. I am quite new at Django.p  pMy website is a musical community that helps people find instruments that other musicians nearby are willing to lend to them in a time of need. p  pIts really important according to my UX designer to have a Submit and Search button in the same form. So the user can either Submit a new listing or Search for an existing one in the parameters entered. p  pThe problem for me is according to my Django book, searches should be done with the codeGETcode method, and Submits should be done with codePOSTcode. Also, where do I write the search functionality in the codeviews.pycode filep  pThis is what I want img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEKTp0.jpg altSearch and Submitp

Negative 342 pI have a 40x7 VFD that functions as a serial terminal. It has a dedicated keypad that provides hexentry, however, I would like to use a keyboard for the standard input.

Instead of connecting a monitor, the serial terminal will be the monitor.

Then on loading of any page,if the users codeIPcode is listed in this table, some operations will be skipped. The problem is that this list may not be 100 accurate, So when a user is identified as a robot, a text will be shown at the top of each page to tell him that if he is wrongly listed, notify the website admin.p  pNow, my question is that Does showing this text for coderobotscode has any bad effects on codegoogle rankingcodep  pThe contents of the page for coderobotscode are essentially the same as normal users, except for that message.p

Negative 342 pI am working on an iOS 8 app that is using a UISplitViewController. I have a custom subclass of UISplitViewController and the app is working fine except for one small issue.p  pI have a button in my table view in the master that brings up a modal form sheet. The form sheet has a done button that is triggering an unwind segue that is handled in my custom subclass of UISplitViewController. This method gets called in all orientations on the iPhone and in landscape on the iPad but in portrait when the master view is a popup my method does not get called. It is like the split view is no longer in the chain so when iOS is looking for a controller that handles the unwind segue method it doesnt go all the way up to the split view. Has anyone seen this before and have any idea how to handle this situationp

Negative 342 pI have added a lot of ui elements in my controller and I have also done the web service part in the implementation code. It seems like my default screen size view controller is not sufficient for me to display the information. Is it possible to add a scroll view to the existing controller and if yes please give an idea or an example, so that I can add some more ui elements.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 342 pI dont know if the issue I have is something to do with execution or issue with the if statement. I have uiimageview with random image, which it picks right after appearing on the screen, animating upwards. The uiimageView animates smoothly but when I call any method or put some code in the if statement below, the uiimageview starts to animate erratically...wierd confusing. The code executes well though, but weird movements give the method called or the code a second chance, I want the uiimageview to continue moving smoothly even when I call a method.p  pI tried to use buttons instead of touchesBegan and UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction but the issue still persists. imageViews are in a container, so they respond based on the image displayed by the animating uiimageview.p  precodeif touch.view  self.imageView1     ampamp [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.movingRectangle1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimagea]     ampamp [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimageb]          [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimagec]          [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimaged]          [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimagee]          [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimagef]           wierd movements happen when I call a method here         NSLogimageShape1 touched, correct view      else if touch.view  self.imageView1          ampamp  [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimageg]                [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimageh]                [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimagei]                [UIImagePNGRepresentationself.imageView1.image isEqualToDataUIImagePNGRepresentationimagej]               NSLogtouched but Wrong view           codepre

I checked pathmanager and is in fullmesh mode  It will create a fullmesh of subflows among all available subflows. p  pThe question is , is there any tool or command to rise up or aggregate the bandwidth of both my interfaces Is there any possibility server not allow to do something like this p  pSomething more is that i have also a 3G usb dongle for mobile Internet. How can i add it to the rooting table for use on my mptcp system when the usb stick is taking ip address from mobile networkp  pThank you in advancep
Negative 342 pI want to encode my code with base64 to limit NOT prevent licence violations.p  precodeZFILENstringDbase64encodeevalKN codepre  pI want to encode it recursively 6 times. I am wondering if this could make any huge performance impact. When I tested it with simple 100 lines code it made 0,5Mb difference in memory usage. But when I tested entire extension inside Magento code cache disabled it was just 0,2MB difference comparing with decoded version. The extension has 20 different php files.p  pWhat I am worried is what will happen on live on different production systems. Do you think I should encode it just lets say 3 times to avoid performance impactp

Negative 342 pFirst, I program for Vintage computer groups.  What I write is specifically for MSDOS and not windows, because thats what people are running.  My current program is for later systems and not the 8086 line, so the plan was to use IRQ 8.  This allows me to set the interrupt rate in binary values from 2  second to 8192  second 2, 4, 8, 16, etc...p  pOnly, for some reason, on the newer old systems ok, that sounds weird, it doesnt seem to be working.  In emulation, and the 386 system I have access to, it works just fine, but on the P3 system I have GA6BXC MB wP3 800 CPU, it just doesnt work.p  pThe codep  pemsetting up the interruptemp  precodedisable oldrtc  getvect0x70    Reads the vector for IRQ 8 settvect0x70,countdown  Sets the vector for  outportb0x70,0x8a y  inportb0x71 amp 0xf0 outportb0x70,0x8a outportb0x71,y  MRATE Adjustable value, set for 64 interrupts per second  outportb0x70,0x8b y  inportb0x71 outportb0x70,0x8b outportb0x71,y  0x40  enable codepre  pemat the end of the interruptemp  precodeoutportb0x70,0x0c inportb0x71        Reading the C register resets the interrupt outportb0xa0,0x20  Resets the PIC turns interrupts back on outportb0x20,0x20  There are 2 PICs on AT machines and later codepre  pemWhen closing program downemp  precodedisable  outportb0x70,0x8b y  inportb0x71 outportb0x70,0x8b outportb0x71,y amp 0xbf setvect0x70,oldrtc  enable codepre  pI dont see anything in the code that can be causing the problem.  But it just doesnt seem to make sense.  While I dont completely trust the information, MSD does report IRQ 8 as the RTC Counter and says it is present and working just fine.  Is it possible that later systems have moved the vector  Everything I find says that IRQ 8 is vector 0x70, but the interrupt never triggers on my Pentium III system.  Is there some way to find if the Vectors have been changedp
Negative 342 pIm just getting into networking and Im quite confused about how I can use a server from a server hosting company for a game. At the moment, the program allows a user to host the server from their computer and it works to some degree. The only problem is that when my friends connect to the game from other states their ping is super high and they lag horribly. p  pIm now using a site that gives out free web hosting space. Ive believe Ive jumped through most of the permission hoops that I need in order to use sockets and the applet works just like it does while running on my computer. p  pBelow is an excerpt from the Game class. If I use InetAddress.getLocalHost.getHostAddress to get the IP, it gets the IP from the user who is using the client and makes them the server host. This works, but it doesnt solve my problem of lag. p  precode    Game.java      public synchronized void start      running  true      thread  new Threadthis, NAME  main     thread.start      if JOptionPane.showConfirmDialogthis, Do you want to run the server  0          socketServer  new GameServerthis         socketServer.start            this.ipAddress  31.170.163.198     this.ipAddress  InetAddress.getByNameipAddress.toString      System.out.printlnIP   this.ipAddress     socketClient  new GameClientthis, this.ipAddressInet4Address.getLocalHost.getHostAddress          try          Player.setIpInet4Address.getLocalHost.getHostAddress      catch UnknownHostException e          e.printStackTrace          socketClient.start  codepre  pI want the server that contains the jar to host the server. We all ping test each other and we mostly all get timed out, however, when we ping the servers ip we all get decent ping. When I enter the Servers IP I find this info in the control panel manually the serverclient fail to make a connection. Ive tried using both the website IP and the server IP that are provided. Ive also tried using the applet.getCodeBase.getHost in order to retrieve the IP from the server but that IP failed to sendreceive data as well. p  pIs what Im trying to do possible Is the server blocking me from using it in that way Do I need to rewrite the whole program and look into java servlets to achieve my goal p  pI apologize if the question is silly. Ive been working on this for the past 34 days with very little progress. Ive searched around a bit on using a server in this manner and Ive found very little on the topic. p  pBelow are some excerpts from other relevant pieces of code. p  precodeGameClient.java  package fraccas.java2dgame.net   public class GameClient extends Thread   private InetAddress ipAddress private DatagramSocket socket private Game game public long lastPing  0 public static int ping  0  public GameClientGame game, String ipAddress      this.game  game     try          this.socket  new DatagramSocket         this.ipAddress  InetAddress.getByNameipAddress         System.out.printlnIP   InetAddress.getByNameipAddress      catch SocketException e          e.printStackTrace      catch UnknownHostException e          e.printStackTrace        public void run      while true          byte[] data  new byte[1024]         DatagramPacket packet  new DatagramPacketdata, data.length         try              socket.receivepacket             if packet  null                              long current  System.currentTimeMillis                 ping  int current  lastPing                 lastPing  current                       catch IOException e              e.printStackTrace                  this.parsePacketpacket.getData, packet.getAddress, packet.getPort        private void parsePacketbyte[] data, InetAddress address, int port      String message  new Stringdata.trim     PacketTypes type  Packet.lookupPacketmessage.substring0, 2     Packet packet  null     switch type      default     case INVALID         break     case LOGIN         packet  new Packet00Logindata         handleLoginPacket00Login packet, address, port         break     case DISCONNECT         packet  new Packet01Disconnectdata         System.out.println[  address.getHostAddress    port  ]                   Packet01Disconnect packet.getUsername   has left the world...         game.level.removePlayerMPPacket01Disconnect packet.getUsername         break     case MOVE         packet  new Packet02Movedata         handleMovePacket02Move packet        public void sendDatabyte[] data      if game.isApplet          DatagramPacket packet  new DatagramPacketdata, data.length, ipAddress, 3333         try              socket.sendpacket          catch IOException e              e.printStackTrace                private void handleLoginPacket00Login packet, InetAddress address, int port      System.out.println[  address.getHostAddress    port  ]   packet.getUsername               has joined the game...

Negative 342 pLets say we have an infinite loop, and we want to put it to sleep for a while, and then resume it. Instead of having a set time, we resume it when we press a key.p  pFor example, in Java we could havep  precodewhiletrue     doSomething  codepre  pNow, we could make this interruptable in many ways. We want to interrupt it on a key press, so we will havep  precodeboolean running  true ... this.addKeyListenerthis ... override public void keyPressedKeyEvent e     running  false  codepre  pAnd then run a method lets say coderuncode, which containsp  precodewhilerunning     doSomething  codepre  pBut then wed meet one problem resuming.p  pSo we take the codekeyPressedcode method, and change its body top  precoderunning  running ifrunning     run  codepre  pThere is just one problem here the KeyListener wont do anything until the coderuncode method is finished. Ive tried using threads, where we would havep  precodeprivate class Runner implements Runnable      Override     public void run          while running              doSomething                codepre  pand in codekeyPressedcodep  precodeifrunning     runner.wait else     runner.notify     runner.run  running  running codepre  pbut in my actual code the codedoSomethingcode method is code that cant be interrupted because it handles output to the screen, so codethread.waitcode can never be called it will throw exceptions all the time and not actually wait.p  pSo then, to summarize How does one stop and resume looping something at will using key input in Javap

The thing is it works fine in a tablet that have a couple of years but if i try to click on some point displaying the app in my mobile Samsung Galaxy S4 with xxxhdpi is long too hard to get some info, it seems its too difficult to click in the exact point.  I think the difference its due to the high density of the mobile screen. Dont know what can I do, any idea Thanks.p

Negative 342 pI am making a game where player sees the game from top. GTA2 type of viewing Thus camera follows the player as he moves anywhere in the map. However as the camera position changes, the images shake very slightly. p  pI have already checked the x and y variables of the shaking objects and even when they are constant, isolated from the other components of the game, I have the same issue. But it is gone when I test the game in fullscreen, so probably libgdx somehow rounds the objects position when the camera dimensions are small. Another clue is that when I use images with very thin lines like image of a net, only some of the lines appear depending on camera position it is again solved when I use fullscreen. So the solution is probably something like p  precodefont.setUseIntegerPositionsfalse codepre  pin terms of SpriteBatch. p  pThe camera dimensions and initialization is as followsp  precodepublic static int cameraWidth  620 public static int cameraHeight  320 ... camera  new OrthographicCamera camera.setToOrthofalse, cameraWidth, cameraHeight   inside the render Update the Time Variable stateTime  Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime Clear the Screen Gdx.gl.glClearColor1F, 1F, 1F, 1F Gdx.gl.glClearGL30.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT Set the Camera final float cameraMaxY  mapHeightmenuHeightcameraHeight2 final float cameraMinY  cameraHeight2 final float cameraMovableY  cameraMaxY  cameraMinY final float cameraMaxX  mapWidthcameraWidth2 final float cameraMinX  cameraWidth2 final float cameraMovableX  cameraMaxX  cameraMinX camera.position.setcameraMinXcameraMovableXcameraFollow.body.getPosition.xmapWidth,cameraMinYcameraMovableYcameraFollow.body.getPosition.ymapHeight,0 camera.update codepre  pwhere cameraFollow is just a variable that represents an object in physics world.

It is hosted on Amazon EC2 with sql server on Amazon RDS, while the urls are registered with www.register.it. I implement external OAuth login through FB, Linkedin, Google and Paypal payments.p  pI need to have multiple url www.urlen.com, www.urlit.com etc all pointing to the same site and then change language and layout masterpage according to the url typed by the user.p  h1The solutionh1  pInitially I thought about pointing all the urls to the ip of my site, but in this way I would need multiple ssl certificates configured I dont even know if its possible and, more important, I wouldnt be able to manage callbacks from esternal login services and paypal payments.p  pSo I configured redirection at the registrar level for each url to point to the main url the english one, so I could read the HTTPREFERRER variable in the global.asax ApplicationStart and set the culture cookie according to the referrer url.  Ive an ActionMethod in the Home controller that set the culture cookie the same used also by the language selector on the sites pages and then I have a custom RazorViewEngine that picks the localized view if present.p  pThe issue is that, having the apppool in integrated mode, I cant read Request object in ApplicationStart, so I tried to do it inside the OWIN Configuration method, but HttpContext.Current.Request.UrlReferrer is null. Should I get the referrer from the OWIN context How could I do that Itd be bettersimpler to do that in javascript checking whether url and referrer are differentp  pThanks Matteop

It does a decent job of classifying the digits.  However, when I run ADADELTA for a long time 30,000 iterations, its clear that something is going wrong.  While the objective function stops improving after a few hundred iterations and the internal ADADELTA variables stop changing, the first layer weights still have the same sparse noise they were initialized with despite real features being learned on top of that noise.p  pTo illustrate what I mean, here is the example output from the visualization of the network. img srchttpi.imgur.comesBffae.jpg altVisualization of internal statep  pNotice the pixel noise in the weights of the first layer, despite them having structure.

Negative 342 pI know how to setup run configurations to pass parameters to a specific python script.  There are several entry points, I dont want a run configuration for each one do I  What I want to do instead is launch a python script from a command line shell script and be able to attach the PyCharm debugger to the python script that is executed and have it stop at break points.  Ive tried to use a prelaunch condition of a utility python script that will sleep for 10 seconds so I can attempt to attach to process of the python script.  That didnt work.  I tried to import pdb and settrace to see if that would stop it for attaching to the process, but that looks to be command line debugging specific only.  Any clues would be appreciated.  Thanks p

This time, I use semanticui validation to make sure the category name inputted is UNIQUE and therefore not yet in the DB and to make sure it is not EMPTY. If I enter a name that is unique, and click the submit button.  It passes the validation. It then calls the codeonSuccesscode callback as above and insert the category name into the MONGO DB database and because Meteor is REACTIVE, the page updates itself showing the new Category.p  pMy problem is that after calling the codeonSuccesscode callback, SemanticUI seem to validate the form again.  This puts me in a situation where the error messages are displayed again when it should not be. Im stuck in this situation....if I dont do anything and just leave the value of input field as it is when it was clicked, then the validation this time checks the value again against the value in the DB and it invalidates the form because the value is no longer UNIQUE as it has just been inserted. I have the option to make that input field empty again when codeonSuccesscode is called.  But if I do that, semantic UI complains that the field is empty and it should not be empty.p  pIdeally, I would like to write something inside the codeonSuccesscode callback to tell semanticui that it has done its job of validating that is why it has reached on onSuccess and PLEASE DONT REVALIDATE as it will show the error messages that I dont want displayed.....p  pIve tried puttingp  precodeform.formclear codepre  pandp  precodeform.formreset codepre  pinside codeonSuccesscode but I have found that the validation happens after codeonSuccesscode therefore resetting the form or clearing the form only makes the field empty and the semanticui form complains about not having a value for that field.p  pIs there a way around this Whats the solutionp  pThank you very muchp
Negative 342 pIm trying to use an arduino to send temperature data via USB to Python.  Im displaying that data in a tkinter label and that works fine.  However, it looks like the data is a binary string and Im trying to do a comparison if reading is greater than x do y.

The label displays 69.25 but the print command displays b69.25rn. Unless someone has a better idea of how to accomplish this, I think I need to convert the binary to a float so I can do the math.

Negative 342 pas the title says, I have an application Spring Boot which must execute some queries on specified objects on a SQL Server database. Such database having a single catalog and multiple schemas, which must be selected based on a previous query and some command line parameters. p  pI cannot seem to implement a strategy which involves Hibernate multitenancy, as most of the tutorials and answers on this site deal with schema names coming from a web request or an external parameter, while I need a database connection before creating the main multitenant EntityManager. So, I switched to a custom DataSource which tries to change the connections default schema using codeALTER USER... WITH DEFAULTSCHEMA  ...code. But this also fails because the loggedin user does not have permission to alter his own default schema.p  pSo Im at a loss of what to do. Any suggestionsp

Good.p  precode2. ltButton TextBlock.ForegroundGreengtHelloltButtongt codepre  p... gives a button with green text.  Good. p  pXamlSpy shows that in version 2, actually, a TextBlock is generated by a TypeConverter.  So, at runtime these two versions are identical.p  pOr are they ...p  precode3. ltButton IsEnabledFalsegtHelloltButtongt codepre  p... gives a disabled button with gray text.  Good.  p  pThe gray color is actually set by a trigger in the buttons style that sets the inheriting dependency property TextBlock.Foreground to gray.p  pAnd now...p  precode4. ltButton IsEnabledFalsegtltTextBlockgtHelloltTextBlockgtltButtongt codepre  p... gives a disabled button with BLACK text.  NOT good.p  pEven though XamlSpy shows the exact same result for 3 and 4, just like it did for 1 and 2, the gray coloring in 4 fails while the green coloring succeeds in 1 and 2.  p  pThe only difference is that in 1 and 2 the property is set in xaml and in 3 and 4 its set from a style trigger.p  pCould this be a bugp

Negative 342 pI want to make something like a virtual keyboard for touchscreen ultrabooks in Java. For example, I want to type in Microsoft Word with my virtual keyboard. p  pWhat Ive done so far is use codeJButtoncode to represent keys, and use the codeRobotcode class to simulate computer input. p  pThe problem I have is when I press the codeJButtoncode, it focuses the codeJButtoncode, and therefore the codeRobotcode class directs the input to the codeJButtoncode instead of the program I want to input to, such as Microsoft Word. p  pMy code looks like this for the button Ap  precodeint KeyValue  KeyEvent.VKA Robot robot ...

I added a codeKeyListenercode to the codeJButtoncode, and an A is being pressed whenever I click the button, but its directed at the codeJButtoncode instead of the other program. p  pI have tried using codeJButton.setFocusablefalsecode, but it didnt work...p  pI have searched other questions similar to mine, but they are all typing natively into another Java Window or Textbox, and not another program. p  pSo my question is  How can I make a virtual keyboard that types into other programs Preferably using codeJButtonscode but Im open to any suggestionsp

Negative 342 pFor example, if an owner codeABC Limitedcode has codeTY18Acode property unit, then it changes its company name to codeProfit Ltdcode in codeeffecteddate 20150729code.

Negative 342 pIm creating a Swift app in Xcode that sends a command to a BLE adapter in order to make the LEDs connected to it change to a different colour. p  pAs Ive established from a reply to a previous post on SO, I have to send command in terms of hex integers in an array. Im using the following code in order to do thisp  precodelet bytes  [UInt8]  [ 0x52, 0x13, 0x00, 0x56, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xAA ] let data  NSDatabytes bytes, length bytes.count codepre  pTherefore, this requires a UInt8 form as suggested above.p  pHowever, Im trying to use sliders as colour pickers on my Swift app in order to set the R, G, and B colours of the LED strip connected to the BLE receiver. In order to do this I have created three sliders for R, G and B respectively, setting the minimum value of each to 0 and the max to 255 since 255 converts to FF in hex. Im then using the following function to convert these to hex form for me to implement in the command above.p  precodefunc colorToHexinput Int gt UInt8      var st  NSStringformat 2X, input     return st  codepre  pThe problem with this is the fact that I must return a UInt8 value back again.

Negative 342 pI am working in an angular js demo project where i am using UI Router for routing. In my project there are two views named strongview1strong and strongview2strong.  For navigation i used tab design so that user can navigate from one view to another. In view1 user needs to insert his strongemail addressstrong and strongpasswordstrong and after clicking submit button i store this information in strongmysqlstrong database by using stronghttpstrong service of angular. After that when i clicked strongview2strong it shows all users email address and password and working fine. But if i return to view1 and register another user and go back to view2 then this new user information is not updated and previous data showed. For showing user information from database i used php.p  pSo what i am thinking is that, at first when we clicked view2 , the page request go to the server and user information show in the view2 after coming from server it turns into plain html.

Negative 342 pIm writing a graphical, online program in Java and using Kryonet library to handle the networking.p  pI believe this library requires the packets to be instances of classes. I am not sure of this, however have not found any documentation suggesting otherwise.p  pI know a little bit about networking and memory efficiency but do not understand this library thoroughly and therefore am not sure if standard approaches will be effective.p  pMy best guess for an efficient data structure is to break my Vec2 objects down into floats representing the X and Y properties respectively. Logically, it should be efficient to store these values in a single float array and then transfer that as a packet.p  pIm not that familiar with memory management as it pertains to object oriented programming. Since this packet is technically an instance, Im guessing this would make the memory arrangement more similar to a C structure. In addition, I have no idea how Kryonet handles the data, so its all very theoretical. p  pMy question is Would cramming all of the data into a single float array be more efficient than say, arranging all of the properties as individual members of the class Or perhaps sets of arrays rather than just onep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 342 pIm trying to allow access to socket.io only if the website the connection is coming from is one of the whitelisted subdomains on my server. The best would be if I could check the origin subdomain everytime a client connects to my socket.io server. I tried finding out how to do it, but havent found a good solution yet. The only thing that comes close to a solution is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma188431992857873this answer to a related questiona. However  Im not sure if thats the best way to do it and if that even works in my case and cant be faked via javascript.p  pstrongTLDRstrong How do I treat socket.io requests differently based on their origin If thats not possible How do I host two socket.io servers on two subdomains, but same portp  pstrongRegarding duplicate flagstrong My Question is entirely different. I cannot use namespaces as a solution since I cant trust the client side javascript running on some subdomains. Therefore these subdomains could just join a different namespace, which would make my efforts to separate them pointless.p

Id like the required signature of this function to be codeAgtFree[F,A]code  the true signature at runtime.  p  precodedef step[F[], A]freeFA Free[F,A] Free[F,A]    freeFA match      case FlatMap       FlatMapx, f, g      gt stepx.flatMapa Any gt fa.flatMapg     .     .     .     codepre  pAnnotating the input type of the anonymous function given to codeflatMapcode as codeAcode makes compilation fail,p  precodestepx.flatMapa A gt fa.flatMapg codepre  pand I understand this is because codeAcode is only a subset of codeAnycodep  precode [error]  found    A gt fpinscala.iomonad.IO3.Free[F,A]  [error]  required Any gt fpinscala.iomonad.IO3.Free[F,A] codepre  pType erasure prevents me from narrowing down codeAnycode to codeAcode like sop  precodedef step[F[], A]freeFA Free[F,A] Free[F,A]    freeFA match      case FlatMap       FlatMap         x Free[F,A],         f Function1[A,Free[F,A]]       ,       g Function1[A,Free[F,A]]      gt stepx.flatMapa A gt fa.flatMapg    .    .    .    codepre  pAnnotating the codecasecode statement this way serves no purpose other than documentation, and even causes problems, written up here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31058950scalatypeannotationsmaketailrecursioncheckfailScala type annotations make tail recursion check failap  pI cant figure out how to apply TypeTags to this situation.p  pHow can I annotate this codecasecode statement to knock down codeAnycode to codeAcode  Thanksp

Negative 342 pI have removed most of the original question but have reworded the lower part to be more specificp  pTop of Original Q I have searched high and low for a practical guide to implement a simple 50Hz low pass filter on a signal.I understand the theory but its the practical but thats missing. If I was using MATLAB it would be trivial because there are so many examples but I am coding this by code. p  pEdited Q Firstly thanks to the people who answered, it is appreciated. p  pSecondly as to MATLAB yes there are many examples some quite cryptic examples out there but this is a hard coded application and using MATLAB is not possible so I want to do this by hand. It is also a learning exercise for me and I just need to get started.p  pPerhaps if I restate the question in an alternative stepwise fashion I have my data and want to use a filter lets say a Gaussian LP filter at 50Hz.p  pDo I do this as followsp  p0 FFT Signal data St  Sf with full complex FFTp  p1 Obtain Gaussian frequency resp for 50Hz LP as e.g. Ff  expcf502p  p2 iFFT Gaussian filter Ff  Ftp  p3 shift and window Ftp  p4 Inverse filter back to f domain iFFT Ft  Ffp  p5 Multiply signal by filter Ff  Sf Rfp  p6 Inverse result to get filtered signal St iFFT Rf  Rtp  p7 Repeat until filter parameters OKp  pSeems more complicated and not what I remember from many years ago doing maths at uni.p

Negative 342 pI read in a text that placing the following preprocessor line ignores all the subsequent assert preprocessor directives. But this doesnt seem to work and the assert statement infact is processed by the preprocessor and aborts the program when the condition in the assert in not satisfiedI know the abort is a correct behaviour when the assert condition is not satisfied.

Negative 342 pI am trying to test some code that uses web workers. I want to check that the error path works i.e., that an codeonErrorcode handler correctly recovers from an exception thrown in the web worker.p  pThe problem Im running into is that the exception propagating out of the web worker causes it to be considered unhandled. For example, it prints in the browsers console log and causes my testing environment a simple wrapper around Karma to consider the test as failed.p  pSo, strongHow do I indicate to the browserKarma that an exception bubbling out of a given web worker is expected, and should not be considered unhandledstrong I dont want it to print to the console, and I want my test to pass.p  pThe only idea Ive come up with is to wrap the web worker code in a trycatch and marshal the caught exception out via codepostMessagecode, but that requires throwing away quite a lot of information because of the need to stringify the error object otherwise it a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7704323passingobjectstoawebworkertriggers a data clone errora.p

I havent done Java in a long while so Im very rusty, but I was thinking of using reflection to accomplish this. Is this at all possiblep  pIf I pass the class of the type I want, is it possible p
