Positive 4956 pWe have one CentOS7 or RedHat 7 BIG HP Proliant DL360 Gen 9 server with 4 NICs, two external switches Switch 1 and Switch 2 and many small servers.p  pThose small servers have two NICs those NICs send exact the same traffic through each NIC to different switches. NIC1 is connected to Switch 1 and NIC2 to Switch 2. So we get redundancy with small servers each server sends the same traffic through two switches towards one BIG server....p  pI tried to understand if I can by using teaming on BIG server create such configuration, for examplep  pNIC1 and NIC2 are team1, two NICs need for 2Gbps bandwidth.. NIC3 and NIC4 are team2 here is exactly the same mirrored 2 Gbps traffic...p  pEach team has the same traffic  and somehow how we need to know or maybe define initial ACTIVE team. WE have to switch to another team if, for example Switch 1 dies, or even if on cableNIC stops work, failed even if cable is taken out of connector..p  pApplication on BIG server should not notice it because it wants to see just one static IP all the time, independently which team is ACTIVE and which is passive..p  pMy question is it possible to configure our BIG by using teaming in the way I described above or we need to buy some High Availability 3rd Party SWp  pThank you for your attention p

Negative 4956 pdoes anybody know if it is possible to cancel already queued selector events from the event stack or timer stack or whatever mechanism it is that is utilized by the API when you call codeperformSelectorwithObjectafterDelaycodep  pI was using this event stack to alter the attributes of an image within a TabBar tab, and would sometimes queue up to 10 seconds worth of changes in one quickly executed for loop... maybe 5 milliseconds or so.p  pthe problem arises if the user switches tabs... like say I have the image alterations queued for an image that is displayed as soon as Tab 4 is enabled, and then the user quickly switches to Tab 3 and then right back to Tab 4... this would then requeue another 10 seconds worth of alterations while the old queue was still playing, probably around 2 or 3 seconds in to the queue if switched quick enough... but even arriving at 5 seconds in to the stream was a problem.p  pso I needed some way to cancel the old stack of changes before putting a new stack on...p  pIm writing this query in the past tense because I already came up with an alternative solution to this problem by adding a hawkeyed event filter on the playback function. however I am still curious if event cancellation is possible, because I have a feeling such knowledge will come in handy in the future. thank you for any assistance rendered p

Negative 4956 pI have a data processing system that generates very large reports on the data it processes. By large I mean that a small execution of this system produces about 30 MB of reporting data when dumped into a CSV file and a large dataset is about 130150 MB Im sure someone out there has a bigger idea of large but thats not the point...  p  pExcel has the ideal interface for the report consumers in the form of its Data Lists users can filter and segment the data onthefly to see the specific details that they are interested in because theyre not really interested in the many thousands of rows, they know how to apply multiple filters to get the data they want  they can also add notes and markup to the reports, create charts, graphs, etc... They know how to do all this and its much easier to let them do it if we just give them the data.p  pExcel was great for the small test datasets, but it cannot handle these large ones. Does anyone know of a tool that can provide a similar interface as Excel data lists  the ability to dynamically create and change filters on multiple fields but can handle much larger files p  pThe next tool I tried was MS Access, and found that the Access file bloats hugely 30 MB input file leads to about 70 MB Access file, and when I open the file, run a report and close it the files at 120150 MB, the import process is slow and very manual currently, the CSV files are created by the same plsql script that runs the main process so theres next to no intervention on my part. I also tried an Access database with linked tables to the database tables that store the report data and that was many times slower for some reason, sqlplus could query and generate the report file in a minute or soe while Access would take anywhere from 25 minutes for the same datap  pIf it helps, the data processing system is written in PLSQL and runs on Oracle 10g.p

Specifically, I read from here a hrefhttpwww.mchange.comprojectsc3p0index.htmlhttpwww.mchange.comprojectsc3p0index.htmla that setting two properties idleConnectionTestPeriod and preferredTestQuery will solve this for me.

Negative 4956 pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pIn the stack that we reuse between projects, we are putting a little bit too much data in the session for passing data between pages. This was good in theory because it prevents tampering, replay attacks, and so on, but it creates as many problems as it solves.p  pSession loss itself is an issue, although its emmostlyem handled by implementing Session State Server or by using SQL Server. More importantly, its tricky to make the back button work correctly, and its also extra work to create a situation where a user can, say, open the same screen in three tabs to work on different records.p  pAnd thats just the tip of the iceberg.p  pThere are workarounds for most of these issues, but as I grind away, all this friction gives me the feeling that passing data between pages using session is the wrong direction.p  pWhat I really want to do here is come up with a best practice that my shop can use all the time for passing data between pages, and then, for new apps, replace key parts of our stack that currently rely on Session.p  pIt would also be nice if the final solution did not result in mountains of boilerplate plumbing code. p  pstrongProposed Solutionsstrongp  pemSessionemp  pAs mentioned above, leaning heavily on Session emseemsem like a good idea, but it breaks the back button and causes some other problems. p  pThere may be ways to get around all the problems, but it seems like a lot of extra work. p  pOne thing thats very nice about using session is the fact that tampering is just not an issue. Compared to passing everything via the unencrypted QueryString, you end up writing much less guard code. p  pemCrossPage Postingemp  pIn truth Ive barely considered this option. I have a problem with how tightly coupled it makes the pages  if I start doing PreviousPage.FindControlSomeTextBox, that seems like a maintenance problem if I ever want to get to this page from another page that maybe does not have a control called SomeTextBox.p  pIt seems limited in other ways as well. Maybe I want to get to the page via a link, for instance.p  pemQueryStringemp  pIm currently leaning towards this strategy, like in the olden days. But I probably want my QueryString to be encrypted to make it harder to tamper with, and I would like to handle the problem of replay attacks as well.p  pOn 4 guys from Rolla, a hrefhttpwww.4guysfromrolla.comarticles0831051.aspxtheres an article about thisa. p  pHowever, it should be possible to create an HttpModule that takes care of all this and removes all the encryption sausagemaking from the page.  Sure enough, a hrefhttpmadskristensen.netpostHttpModuleforquerystringencryption.aspxMad Kristenson has an article where he released one.a However, the comments make it sound like it has problems with extremely common scenarios.p  pstrongOther Optionsstrongp  pOf course this is not an exaustive look at the options, but rather the main options Im considering. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc300437.aspxS6This linka contains a more complete list.

It appears MySQL is unable to effectively use both lastchange and category in the typeproclastcat index. If I switch the order of lastchange and category, fewer rows are selected but it results in a filesort for the ORDER BY, meaning it pulls all the matching rows from the database. That is worse, since there are 100,000 rows in both tables.p  pTables are both InnoDB, so keep in mind that the PRIMARY key is appended to every other index. So the index the index typeproclastcat above behaves likes its on type, processingstatus, lastchange, category, id. I am aware I could change the PRIMARY key for Battles to id, status and drop the idstatus index and I may just do that.p  pEdit Any value for type, category, processingstatus, and status is less than 20 of the total values. lastchange and statuslastchange are unix timestamps.p  pEdit If I use a different index with codecategorycode and codelastchangecode in reverse order, I get thisp  precodemysqlgt show indexes from Content   Table    Nonunique  Keyname             Seqinindex  Columnname        Collation  Cardinality  Subpart  Packed  Null  Indextype  Comment    Content           0  PRIMARY                         1  id                 A                 4115      NULL  NULL          BTREE                 Content           1  typeproccatlast              1  type               A                    6      NULL  NULL          BTREE                 Content           1  typeproccatlast              2  processingstatus  A                   26      NULL  NULL          BTREE                 Content           1  typeproccatlast              3  category           A                  228      NULL  NULL          BTREE                 Content           1  typeproccatlast              4  lastchange        A                 4115      NULL  NULL          BTREE                   mysqlgt explain SELECT c.id id, type FROM Content c USE INDEX typeproccatlast LEFT JOIN Battles b  USE INDEX idstatus ON c.id  b.id WHERE type  1     AND processingstatus  1     AND category IN 13, 19     AND status  4 ORDER BY lastchange DESC LIMIT 100   id  selecttype  table  type   possiblekeys       key                 keylen  ref                    rows  Extra                                        1  SIMPLE       c      range  typeproccatlast  typeproccatlast  10       NULL                    165  Using where Using index Using filesort    1  SIMPLE       b      ref    idstatus           idstatus           9        wtmmaster.c.id,const     1  Using where Using index                   codepre  pThe filesort worries me as it tells me MySQL pulls all the matching rows first, before sorting.

Negative 4956 pI guess Im stupid but I dont see what is the reason behind some new HTML5 tags.p  pSome tags, like codeltaudiogtcode and codeltcanvasgtcode provide some great new functionalities to the browser, but others such as codeltarticlegtcode, codeltsectiongtcode etc. just show up as a codeltdivgtcode or codeltspangtcode. Therefore, why have these tags been added to HTML5p  pI made this jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6BHAM relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net6BHAMa. In Chrome at least, there is no exciting layout or whatever.

Negative 4956 pI have an animated image which works great. It consists of 180 high quality images and it plays fine and loops continuously.

Negative 4956 pUntil recently I considered errorchecking mutexes mostly as a debugging tool with little value in correct code, but then I realized they have the property that they can replace recursive mutexes, as inp  precodevoid foo      int oktounlock  pthreadmutexlockm      do something      if oktounlock pthreadmutexunlockm  codepre  pNote that codepthreadmutexlockcode returns 0 on success and codeEDEADLKcode if the caller already holds the lock. This usage has the advantage that you dont have to worry about exceeding an arbitrary recursive lock limit the lock count is implicit in the call frame. In principle this idiom might perform slightly better too, since the function call to codepthreadmutexunlockcode is never made when the calling thread already held the lock.p  pMy question is mainly then about style does using errorchecking mutexes like this detract from the clarity of the code Are there any other reasons you wouldnt want to use them like thisp

Negative 4956 pI have written a windows service that uses the openpop mail client and retreives emails. Then it goes through the subject and body update databases and all kinds of stuff. It also downloads the attachments and creates a folder directory on the drive based on the timestamp of the email it goes by year, then the month, then the day, and then saves the image. So, I built this service on my machine in development using a class library project, a winform project for debugging, and a windows service project.  All the logic is contained in a Classlibrary. I build the library and reference the dll in both the form and the windows service. When I build the service on my machine and install it using installutil it works fine, and does what its supposed to do. But when I went to production, the OS is Windows Server 2003 R2, and it is using a different connection string for the LIVE database. p  pThe only things that changed were the connection string and the operating system. I installed the service and it installed fine, but does nothing. It doesnt create the folders or save the images to disk.

As a matter of fact, if I try to create the log and write an event, as my first call in the onstart sub, it doesnt do it. Now Im lost, and I am not sure where to go from here.

Negative 4956 pI cant figure out why small differences to big files are causing my subversion repository to grow so much.p  pI have a zip file of the contents a database used by some tests.  I want to store each new version of the test data in our subversion repository.p  pIve done some experiments, checking in the last few versions of the data.zip and looking at what happens to the size of the repository.  The uncompressed data is about 150MB, compressed and zipped its 50MB.  Each new version of the data.zip file checked into the repository increases the repositorys size by about 50MB.  I think it should only increase by the amount of a delta which I expect to be much less.p  pSubversion uses xdelta to store compressed difference data.   My attempt to confirm that SVN could do better was to download xdelta and check there isnt much difference between two versions.  Indeedp  precodexdelta3.0z.x8664.exe e s v1pathdata.zip v2pathdata.zip v1v2delta.file codepre  pproduced a v1v2delta.file which was about 3MB.p  pIve looked in the SVN repository at [myrepo]dbrevs and can see large files for each new revisionp  precode02082011  1112        57,853,082 4189 02082011  1140        51,713,289 4190 02082011  1146        52,286,060 4191 codepre  pThe 4189, 4190 and 4191 are the names of files.p  pI even tried zipping the data.zip without compression.  This didnt make a difference to what SVN stores  from the look of it, my guess is that it is storing a compressed copy of the entire data.zip for every revision, not just the first.  Im running SVN 1.6 with an FSFS backend.p  pThere are various other good stackoverflow answers about committing binaries and how SVN stores deltas, e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions127692svnperformanceaftermanyrevisionsSVN performance after many revisionsa. But I cannot see from these why deltas arent being stored in the above case  ie. if xdelta can get such a small diff running standalone, surely SVN can too  or is it choosing not top  pstrongEditstrong Ive also tried tar uncompressed files, again SVN isnt storing them efficiently.  Also I found that we have a zip file of the same data format although much smaller in a different repository where SVN emhas just stored diffsem.  p  pSo the summarized version of this question is SVN can efficiently store binary files, e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions538643howgoodissubversionatstoringlotsofbinaryfiles54845454845410 slightly different CAD files are just 1.2 times the size of 1a.  SVN even can be space efficient with compressed zip files sometimes.  But evidently it isnt always space efficient with binary files  under what conditions is this the casep

Negative 4956 pThis may be a easy question but for some reason I can not seem to figure out how to get a page to automatically resize when changing from Landscape to Portrait in a Flex Mobile App.p  pi.e. I have a page that displays a menu to collect customer information, I have it laid out how I would like it for Portrait but if I switch to Landscape the formatting causes information to be left off of the screen. p  pThis could be a question that I should probably know the answer to but does anyone have any ideas on how to go about something like thisp  pThanks in advance for any advicep

Negative 4956 pI have the challenge of needing to audit data changes made by users of an MVC application.p  pAuditing creation and deletion of records is easy.p  pUpdates is proving to be the problem.p  pIm looking for a way to automate this, but the problem I have is that the application is using stored procedures to bring back EF complex types.p  pThese are then used to build a view model, and after postback, the controller receives a new view model built from the form values passed back from the view. Therefore the original values are no longer available.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions for a secure way to keep the original values so they can be compared with the updated values, so that changes can be stored p  pI appreciate I could go back to the database for these, but is not efficient, and I would have to retain all the parameters to remake the same call, and find a way to automate that part of the process.p

Negative 4956 pSomeone in stackoverflow answered stack is attached to a thread, so when the thread exits the stack is reclaimed. But what about public variables how they are managed once thread execution is completed. p  pFor Ex. Declared public variable like p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form          int k  10          private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                                  k  k  5           codepre  pSo in this whenever we click button1 a thread is created which updates value of k and then exist so as per this statement stack should be reclaimed and recent value of k should be lost but in reality it store that value and next button click will changes its retain value for ex. from 1 10 to 15 215 to 20 3 20 to 25 etc....p  pSo My question is where such global variables are stored. Whether any other stack used for global variables.  Also I will use object of a class inside a function for ex. such as p  precodepublic function add int a, int b         int c         clsitem objitem  new clsitem        cab  objitem.id        retun c  codepre  pso what will happened of objitem , whether it will store in stack and reclaimed when thread exits or it will stay in heap as it is an objectp

Negative 4956 pI have a codeCLRcode process which runs under codeSQL Server2008code. It builds a cache of several tables data to hold in a static class for use later by other calls.p  pMy question is could I improve the process of loading this cache by spawning threads to load each data set table in my cachep  pIve steared clear of this in the past as various posts have suggested leave the thread management to codeSQL Servercode. However I could really do with speeding up this process. Currently its a sequential process to load each data set. If I could run these concurrently it would be very handy.

Negative 4956 pOne of the many benefits of implementing any pattern is to have a separation of concerns between the different layers in an application. In the case of Silverlight and MVVM it is my opinion that the NavigationService belongs to the UI.p  pIf the NavigationService belongs to the UI then it should be used in the XAML code behind, but the commands happens on the ViewModel. Should I raise an event on the Command in the ViewModel and let the View handle the event and call the Navigation That sounds a little absurd if all Im doing is simply navigating to another page.

Negative 4956 pI made a custom class that extends ProgressBar for some extra functionality. Its all functioning but I found that there is a difference in the way it displays on different phones with different ROMs.p  pFor instance, it works flawlessly on the Android emulator but its kinda messed up on my actual phone which runs MIUI ROM but runs fine on my old HTC with Cyanogen. I figured its because MIUI has its own custom ProgressBar class, among other custom widget classes made by them to give the ROM a different look.p  pI want to know if there is a way to include the 2.3.3 AOSP ProgressBar class in my app so that it overrides the class already present on the phone of the user, regardless of the custom ROM of the user.p  pThanksp

Negative 4956 pI have an API module in my application which is a RESTful API  basically set of public web services. I want to unit test my web services with PHPUnit.

Negative 4956 pIn C, I am running the WebBrowser WB control in a serverside thread and want to monitor listen for onpropertychange events.  I can successfully attach a .NET delegate signature method that is executed when a  property changes, but the strongsender and e objects are both nullstrong in every call to qEventHndlr, therefore, I dont know which property changed to fire the event.  el is an HTMLElement that is iterated in a foreach loop to attach the eventhandler to each  element to monitor listen.p  precodeel.AttachEventHandleronpropertychange, qEventHndlr      in the foreach loop public void qEventHndlrObject sender, EventArgs e       the event handler codepre  pThe documentation indicates that the EventArgs class This class contains no event data it is used by events that do not pass state information to an event handler when an event is raised. If the event handler requires state information, the application must derive a class from this class to hold the data. It also seems Im not certain and havent tested that sender is only populated for a subset of WB events and not onpropertychange.p  pSo, I then thought that if I cant get  identifier information in the send or e objects, I could use an anonymous method in the AttachEventHandler and then pass a unique runtime programmable string parameter to a method embedded in the event handler method call.p  precodeel.AttachEventHandleronpropertychange, delegateObject sender, EventArgs e  anonoMethelID  public void anonoMethstring specificProperty .. codepre  pThe compiler accepted the syntax, however, even though the elID string changes in the foreach loop, only the first iteration value is used so that when anonoMethstring specificProperty is called with each onpropertychange event, specificProperty has the same value because the same elID was attached to the respective  element.p  pI havent tried Extension Methods yet and wanted to get this posted to see if anyone has encountered similar challenges and hopefully has a solution.  I prefer not to resort to C unless I absolutely have to.p

Negative 4956 pIm experiencing what I think is a very strange issue. p  pFirst and foremost, my application moves UI elements around the screen using the following example commandp  precode    [view setFrameNSRectFromCGRectCGRectMake0, 0, 0, 0]  codepre  pI give my users the possibility to resize the applications NSWindow to one other size with this commandp  precode    [self.window setFrameNSRectFromCGRectCGRectMake0, 0, 0, 0 displayYES animateYES] codepre  pWhen in resized mode, I obviously change every single codesetFramecode command to the appropriate coordinate system.p  pHowever, there is an issue when if the user switches back to the original NSWindow size by clicking on the button again, and the application performs the UI movements again, the views that are moved around are not in the location they are supposed to be in.p  pTo clarify my UI movement code runs fine, over and over, either in normal or resized mode. However, if I switch from one to the other, some items not all are shifted.p  pWhat could be causing this strange behavior Im using the same exact commands within each screen resolution, and NSLogs confirm the UI elements are in the location that I specified however, this location is emclearlyem not the one Im attempting to move to.p  pHas anyone experienced a similar issue herep

Negative 4956 pSituation a main form calls a modal jDialog with textboxes in which parameters are filled in by the user to create or modify an instance of a certain class, call it ClassA.p  pWhen the dialog needs to modify an existing instance, it is passed in the constructor as a parameter. Otherwise the jDialog will create a new instance of ClassA.p  pProblem the mainform needs to access that new instance, and I think it is unclean code to pass the entire main form as a parameter, and let the dialog push the new instance into it by a method call, because that way a perfectly reusable standalone dialog becomes only usable with one single main form that needs a certain classname and method to receive the new instance.p  pIt is much more logical to make the main form get the new instance from the jdialog after the OK button is clicked, by calling a getClassAInstance method which could be called also when an existing instance was being modified. The method is called after the setVisibletrue method on a new instance of the jdialog in question. The dialog appears, the thread of the main form will sleep until the dialog is closed because it is modal. The OK button calls the dispose method of the jDialog, then the very next statement is the getClassAInstance call on the jDialog by the mainform.p  pHeres the same thing in code..p  precodeClassAInstanceMakerDialog imd  new ClassAInstanceMakerDialogthis, true imd.setVisibletrue imd.dispose after OK button click System.out.printlnimd.getClassAInstance return a new ClassA instance  output whatever ClassA.toString should return, works fine codepre  pQuestion Ive tried it and it seems to work perfectly fine. But, is it a good code Is there any danger of the getClassAInstance method returning null, because the garbage collector collected the ClassA instance after the jDialog was disposed and before the main form could complete the callp  pPlease excuse me if I didnt make myself clear, Im not a native English speaker.

However, if I do anything with the tempfile between creation and codeLOADcodeing, for example with  p  precodetouch tempfile codepre  peverything works as expected. p  pIs this an issue with the MySQL driver having trouble with freshly created tempfiles Is it a filesystem ext4 issue, maybe a cache flush not happening in time Am I missing something herep  pstrongEDITstrong Actually, emallem records are omitted if the temporary CSV file is not created by a formatconverter subroutine, but by hand as shown below.

Negative 4956 pI would like to share the data access portion of my grails app Grails domain classes and services with another grails app.  One is a standard client facing web app, the other not yet written will be for periodic background tasks such as reminder emails and such using the Quartz plugin or similar, where the UI will just be for statisticscontrol for internal users.  p  pI do not want this all bundled in one Grails application because I want to be able to scale them and run them on different machines.  What is the proper way to do this  I have accomplished this in the past in more legacy Java web applications by bundling the shared data access classes into a .jar and including them where needed in multiple apps, but Im not sure if this is the right approach for Grails.p  pIve considered a full blown service oriented architecture where a third grails application is responsible for all data access and the two described do all their data access through REST calls to this service app, but this is out of scope for the short term since the client facing webapp is already written.p
Negative 4956 pI have a parent process and a forked child process, and they share a Unixdomain IPC socket, created with codesocketpairAFUNIX, SOCKSTREAM, 0, socketscode. Both of the processes close one end of the socketpair, and save the other end into the codesockcode variable. After that they do thisp  precodeint sock  Unixdomain socket  void childmain    printfI am childn         sleep1         closesock   void parentmain    printfI am parentn    writesock, hello, 5    char buf[100]   int ret  readsock, buf, 100  this read will return ECONNRESET   if ret  1       perrorread     exit1     codepre  pParent process writes some data into the socket, and the child emdoesntem read it. Instead the child closes the socket. Now my concern is that codereadcode in the parent process fails with ECONNRESET Connection reset by peer, while I would expect that it will return 0 indicating end of stream. Because the other end of the socket was emgracefullyem closed by calling codeclosecode.p  pNow, I understand that behaviour closing the socket without reading pending data generates ECONNRESET, but where is this documented a hrefhttplinux.die.netman2read relnofollowcodeman readcodea says nothing about ECONNRESET, but it mentionsp  blockquote   pOther errors may occur, depending on the object connected to fdp blockquote  pThe a hrefhttplinux.die.netman7unix relnofollowman page for unix domain socketsa only saysp  blockquote   pECONNRESET Remote socket was unexpectedly closed.p blockquote  pBut since Unixdomain sockets are a local IPC thing, I suppose it could be much more specific about the circumstances when this error can happen.p  pMy deeper thoughts are something like this If the specification say e.g. codeclosecode will generate endofstream mark only if there is no data to read from the socket, how does it know if the other process isnt just about to write some Doesnt that create a race condition How does the kernel know if the connection is going to be closed gracefully or notp

Negative 4956 pIm trying to use Scalas manifests to instantiate a type, and Im running into problems when that type is parameterized on types with a view bound.  Ive distilled the problem down to the following codep  precodeclass foo[X lt Ordered[X]]   def boo[T]implicit m  Manifest[T]   m.erasure.newInstance.asInstanceOf[T]   boo[foo[String]]  java.lang.InstantiationException foo     at java.lang.Class.newInstance0Class.java357     at java.lang.Class.newInstanceClass.java325     . . . codepre  pSo you can see we have a simple class, foo, which is parameterized on X which is view bounded by Ordered[X].  The boo function simply attempts to instantiate a new instance of a foo[String] using manifests.  However, when this function is called, things go horribly awry and I get the stack trace that begins as I have shown.  When the type parameter of foo is not view bounded, the instantiation works without issue.  I assume this has something to do with the fact that the view bound is just syntactic sugar for the existence of an implicit conversion of X  Ordered[X], and that somehow the manifest being dependent on another manifest is causing a problem.  However, I have no idea whats really happening or, more importantly, how to fix it.  Is this even possible in Scala, and if not, how do people achieve something similarp

Negative 4956 pI cant figure this out, and couldnt find a solution after googling around.  Im implementing caching for my Django app.p  pThe steps I took werep  ol lipbrew install libmemcache, which installed memcache as wellpli lippip install pylibmcpli lippip install e hghttpsjmoironbitbucket.orgjmoironjohnnycache, which installed without error.pli lipAdded this to my settings.pyp  precodeCACHES       default          BACKEND johnny.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache,         LOCATION [127.0.0.111211],         JOHNNYCACHE True,       JOHNNYMIDDLEWAREKEYPREFIX  product  MIDDLEWARECLASSES       johnny.middleware.LocalStoreClearMiddleware,     johnny.middleware.QueryCacheMiddleware,     ...  codepreli ol  pNow whenever I browse, in the console I can see things being stored in memcache, but as soon as a memcached get comes up, codeCaught TypeError while rendering cannot concatenate str and tuple objectscode is thrown. Doesnt matter what command is being run, and the error is in codeenvpfenvlibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangodbbackendsmysqlcompiler.py in resolvecolumns, line 12code.p  pThere is one other SO question about this, but the selected answer is to just use a different fork of the project, which hasnt been updated and whose changes were actually merged into the master bucket almost right away. The pypi version which I also tried is from before the commit they claim broke things, and that one gives me the same error. This project is updated every two weeks or so and Id like to get the benefit of other bugfixes theyve released.p  pThis should be pretty easy to implement, what am I doing wrong herep  h2Updateh2  pSubmitted a a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgjmoironjohnnycacheissue66typeerroronget relnofollowbug reporta that also includes the stack trace, just in case this isnt something that Ive done.p  h2Update 2h2  pActually went back and flushed the cache, turned off johnnycache, and tried just the vanilla django cache settings with pylibmc. Doesnt work, same error on every page. Tried it with pythonmemcache, same thing. Not sure what to look for here. Turning off caching completely, the site works just fine. strongKinda need the caching though.strongp  h2Update 3h2  pApparently this same source checked out by a coworker and installed the same way works. I have no idea what the difference is or what else to do to troubleshoot. Any suggestionsp
Negative 4956 pIm making a little WinForms app where you can open a photo, pan around, and zoom in.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comN2kMV.pngp  pHaving a little trouble figuring out the logic to pan it.

Negative 4956 pSometimes when looking at optimised code, I see that parameters that are used only within the scope of a loop have their declaration moved outside of the loop.p  pSomething like thisp  precodeA arr[BIGNUMBER]   ....   for int i0 iBIGNUMBER i      B b  arr[i].getB      ... do some work with b.  codepre  pbeing turned into thisp  precodeA arr[BIGNUMBER]   ....   B b for int i0 iBIGNUMBER i      b  arr[i].getB      ... do some work with b.  codepre  pPresumably the reasoning is that were saving on continually redeclaring codebcode. But is this a reasonable thing to do And is the answer different depending on whether B is a primitive type or a classp  pI would have thought that whilst the scope limitations of the variables within the for loop may prevent them from being accessed outside the loop, as the loops contents exists within the same stack frame, the actual declaration only happens once.p  pNB, Ive considered a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq3009489794283Creating an object in the loopa but consider this to be a different question as it is about any costs associated with declaration rather than initialisation.p  pEDIT  improved titlep

Negative 4956 pI have a ThreadManager with two Threads. One for guirelevant requests and one for measurementrelevant requests. The are both running and checking their queue of requests, if there is any, they are processing the request. One can add requests at any time, using the static codeThreadManager.addGuiRequesteGuiRequestcode and codeThreadManager.addMeasRequesteMeasRequestcode methods. Now both of those need to be initialized which is done by adding a codeINITcode request to the corresponding queue. But the initialization of the measurement is depending on the fact that the gui is already initialized. I tried to solve this using codewaitnotifycode, but I can not get it working.p  pHere is a SSCCE. At startup, both queues have a INIT request added and are then started. The measurement initialization detects that the gui is not yet initialized and perfomrs a codewaitcode. The gui initializes simulated by sleeping for 5s.

Negative 4956 pIm currently refactoring a former monster of a method in a SpringMVC controller. The method basically does the following thingsp  ol liDigs up a few identifiers from the requestli liGets an XML representation for a product identified by them from a cacheli liUses an XSL stylesheet to produce a PDF which it then stores to a cache and adds the key it can be found with to the codeModelcode.li ol  pIve been able to remove almost all duplicated logic by making a codeProductcode enum which contains all the other product specific things, but the locations of the XSL stylesheets are problematic. Previously they were configured as codeorg.springframework.core.io.Resourcecodetype properties of the controller bean, but now that the product specific things are in the enum, I would either need to map them somehow to the enum constants or find another solution for locating them.p  pI think it would be best to have the XSL as part of the enum since theres a 1to1 relationship between them, but theres no way to inject the resource there. Using the class loader to load the resource to the enum manually would work in tests, but would be problematic in production environment since the stylesheet files are not in the classpath there. Plus I wouldnt like to make the enum depend on any Spring stuff.p  pAny ideas on how to tackle this problem without making the enum and the controller too tightly coupledp

Negative 4956 pCurrently, I have a big CakePHP application with a layout and a lot of views. In the layout, I load Javascript files in the head which are needed by most views. In the views themself, I either load additional Javascript files e.g., load a library file that is only needed there, or I add some Javascript code that is only relevant for this view in a script tag, for example if I need a click handler.p  pSince it is a known fact that loading Javascript files in the HTML head blocks loading the page, I wanted to put them at the bottom before closing the body Tag. But if I do so, the Javascript in my views that load the content breaks because it does not know about my loaded Javascript files.

Negative 4956 pTo firstly get this out of the way..  I have already recompiled eggdrop under the utf8 encoding.  I am able to echo out utf8 characters if I write the escape sequences in stringscodeu00a7code, but for some reason I cannot yet figure out.. I am unable to compare them using regex to their counterparts.p  pI am attempting to develop a logging script based on eggdrop, coded under tcl.  Ive already spent a few hours doing nothing but research, but either there isnt any help out there, or Im looking in the wrong places.p  pAn input string, sect, is typed by a user in an irc channel that the bot is on.  The logging script, linux side, interprets this character as a special control characterI think, and it renders in gedit as a twolined special character whose appearance looks like FFA7, with the FF on the first line and the A7 on the second, all enclosed in a box.p  pMy regex is quite simplep  precoderegexp all u00a7 text codepre  pI have of course also triedp  precoderegexp all 247 text codepre  pUnfortunately, as already stated.. it does not work.  I get a 0 every time, meaning it never matches the character.p  pFor all the research Ive done, Ive been unable to figure out what format eggdrop is sending the strings in to the tcl script.  The only thing has worked is to copy that boxlike character from gedit directly into the script.. but given I cannot replicate this character otherwise, it becomes rather impossible to code.p  pTo the question.. Im wondering what Im doing wrong here, if there is in fact a correct way to interpret the string sent by the bot so I can correctly convert the special characters in it to html entities.p

Negative 4956 pI am implementing a functionality called Single New Line and New Paragraph in Textarea on Google Chrome Browser in IE my solution is working so no issue on IE because IE considers ShiftEnter rn and Enter n differently.

Negative 4956 pIm looking for some advicehelp on quite a complex search algorithm. Any articles to relevant techniques etc. would be much appreciated.p  h1Backgroundh1  pIm building an application, which, in a nutshell, allows users to set their availability for any given day. The User first sets a general availability template which allows them to sayp  precodeMonday  AM    Tuesday  PM   Wednesday  All Day   Thursday  None   Friday  All Day codepre  pSo this User is generally available Monday AM, Tuesday PM etc.p  pSchemap  precodeid   userid   dayofweek  17Monday to Sunday availability codepre  pThey can then override specific dates manually, for examplep  precode20130303  am   20130304  pm   20130305  allday codepre  pSchemap  precodeid userid date availability codepre  pThis all works well  I have a Calendar being generated which combines the template and overrides and allows Users to modify their availability etc.p  h1The Problemh1  pI now need to allow Admin Users to search for Users who have specific availability. So the Admin User would use a calendar to select required dates and availabilitys and hit search.p  pFor example, find me Users who are availablep  precode20130303  pm 20130304  pm 20130305  pm codepre  pThe search process would have to search for available Users using the Templated Availability and Overrides, then return the best results. Ideally, it would return Users who are available all of the time but in the case that no single user can match the dates, I need to provide a combination of Users who can.p  pI know this is quite a complex problem and Im not looking for a complete answer, perhaps just some guidance or links to potentially relevant techniques etc.p  h1What Ive triedh1  pAt the moment, I have a halfway solution. Im grabbing all the available Users, looping through each of them, and within that loop, looping through all of the required dates and breaking as soon as a User doesnt meet a required date. This is obviously very unscalable and its also only returning perfect matches.p  h1Possible Solutionsh1  h2Full Text Searching with Aggregate Tableh2  pI thought about creating a separate table which had the following schemap  precodeuserid body codepre  pThe codebodycode field would be populated with the Users template days and overrides so an example record might look likep  precodeuserid 2 body mondayam tuesdaypm wednesdaypm thursdayam fridayallday 20130303allday 20130303pm codepre  pI would then convert a Users search query into a similar format. So if a User was looking for someone who was available on the 19th March 2013  All Day and 20th March 2013  PM, Id convert that into a string.p  pFirstly, as 19th March is a Tuesday, Id convert that into tuesdayallday and same with the 20th. Id therefore end up withp  precodetuesdayallday wednesdaypm 20130319allday 20130320pm codepre  pId then do a full text search against our aggregate table and return a weighted result set which I can then loop through and further interrogate.p  pIm not sure how this would work in practice, so thats why Im asking if anyone has any links to techniques or relevant articles I could use.p

If it finds their name, it sets the row below their name as a first variable. p  pHere is where I run into a problem. The next step is to find the next employee listed, and set the row above as the second variable. Then I use the first and second variables to copy and paste that range of rows.

Negative 4956 pIm getting a frustrating error while trying to run a simple Node.js app on Heroku. Heroku itself is not reporting an error   the app is up not crashed, no Hxx codes being shown what I get is this p  precodeheroku[router] atinfo methodGET pathindex.html hostrealsheek.herokuapp.com fwd24.63.82.165 dynoweb.1 connect0ms service4ms status404 bytes33 codepre  pWhen i run the app from the browser, it says codeCannot GETcode. I dont know what its trying to codeGETcode. My app is a test bed for a SocialProvider using Mozillas SocialAPIs. The app itself is a version of the demo from codehttpsgithub.commixedpuppysocialapidemocode. A couple of bugs were fixed, else this is identical to this demo i used the repo as is with just the bugs fixed. I have an codeindex.htmlcode page which installs the SocialProvider, at which time the serverside app kicks in and does the rest of the magic. It runs fine on codelocalhostcode, but when I push it up to Heroku, it fails. There were no problems reported with the codegit pushcode just the usual no readme data warnings.p  pI am stumped as I just cant see what its trying to GET obviously a 404 error suggests a missing page, but the app makes no calls to any codeHTMLcode pages, and everything thats needed is present as my run on codelocalhostcode confirms.p  pI realize that this isnt a lot to go on, not seeing the actual app and not knowing what its trying to do. And with no actual error to report  just a 404 status, it obviously could be anything. But I am stumped currently, so if anyone has any insight or suggestion, Id be most grateful.p

Negative 4956 pMy app has so many strings in an codeNSArraycode and the user usually can click on a button which is linked with an ib action to go either next or previous. When they click next or previous the text within a codeTextViewcode changes to the next or previous string within the array. I want the user to be able to swipe within the codeTextViewcode to go either next or previous. Ive learned a little bit about how to recognize swipes but that requires a whole new codeclasscode which inherits codeUITextViewcode while my other class that contains the array and ib actions inherit a codeUIViewcontrollercode. Im going to post what my code looks like and I just want to know how to connect either the swipe class or have within the action to recognize the swipe.

Negative 4956 pId like to accomplish the followingp  pI have a form represented in a JSP  lets call this codeinput.jspcode. This form submits to a servlet which will create objects in a DB  lets call this codeCreateServletcode. When the form is successfully submitted, the servlet should direct the user back to codeinput.jspcode and display a success message. When validation fails, it should redirect back to codeinput.jspcode, display an error message, retain the input values.p  pI can think of a few optionsp  ol lipOn validation failure I can use a codeRequestDispatchercode to perform a forward to codeinput.jspcode. This would allow me to easily display the validation errors and input parameters from the form. However, I know that a hrefhttpwww.javapractices.comtopicTopicAction.doId181 relnofollowa forward should not be used in the case of performing an edit operationa, so when the request is successful I should not do a forward and should do a redirect instead. The problem with a redirect is that I cant set attributes as easily unless I pass it in the URL, e.g. codeinput.jspsuccesstruecode.pli lipI can store validation messages, success messages, and input values in the session, and always perform a redirect. After the JSP has displayed the page then it can remove these attributes from the session.pli ol  pI am using plain servlets and JSP and not any framework like Struts. What is the recommended practice in this casep

Negative 4956 pI have people indexed into solr based on documents that they have authored. For simplicitys sake, lets say they have three fields  an integer ID, a Text field and a floating point SpecialRank a value between 0 and 1 to indicate how great the person is. Relevance matching in solr is all done through the Text field. However, I want my final result list to be a combination of relevance to the query as provided by solr and my own SpecialRank. Namely, I need to rerank the results based on the following formulap  precodefinalScore  0.8  solrScore  0.2  SpecialScore codepre  pAs far as Im aware, this is a common task in information retrieval, as we are just combining two different scores in a weighted manner. The trouble is, I need solrScore to be normalized for this to work. What I have been doing is normalizing the solrScore based on the maxScore for a particular query and reranking the results clientside. This has been working OK, but means I have to retrieve all the matching documents from solr before I do my reranking.p  pI am looking for the best way to have solr take care of this reranking. Are boost functions able to help here I have read that they can be multiplicative or additive to the solr score, but since the solr score is not normalized and all over the place depending on different queries, this doesnt really seem to solve my problem. Another approach I have tried is to first query solr for a single document just to get the maxScore, and then use the following formula for the sort p  precodesumproduct0.8,divscore,maxScore,product0.2,SpecialRankdesc codepre  pThis, of course, doesnt work as youre unable to use the score as a variable in a sort function.p  pAm I crazy here Surely this is a common enough task in IR.

Negative 4956 pI have found several examples where folks have written code for mapping points on google earth via a button on an access form which loops throug data in a table or query.  I have used this code to map multiple points by looping through the recordset.  I am now trying to connect the points with a polygon.  I have included the code for the polygon within the same loop code.  However, instead of one polygon connecting the points, a polygon is made for each point.

Negative 4956 pI have a problem where allocating to much Xmx causes a problem of the most unusual kind.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong Setting Xmx to 3072m on a 32bit JVM on a 64bit Linux OS works except for one condition where a servlet attempts to communicate with many outside entities via JNI IPC.

Negative 4956 pIm wondering what the best approach in AngularJS is to secure admin pages, i.e. pages that normal users shouldnt be able to see. Obviously, there will be backend authentication but since the AngularJS app is clientside, people could still theoretically look at the routing and go to those URLs directly and look at the admin pages.p  pIm using Express, PassportJS amp MongoDB Mongoose as my backend. Naturally, they wouldnt be able to interact with the admin pages since there is serverside authentication on creation, deletion, ... but Id much prefer to not even serve the pages to the user if they do not have the proper access. Since the app is fully clientside JS though, Im thinking this is kind of impossible since people can just modify the routing and whatnot. Whats the best way to go about this Thanks for any inputp

Negative 4956 pWhen I have defined a Gated Build, when somebody checks in code the Integration Build field of a work item changes to the Gated Build number if the developer associates his check in with work items, of course. Once a CI build is triggered this field changes to the CI build number.p  pMy question is Is there any way of not changing the Integration Build field of a work item once a Gated Build is triggeredp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pLet me be more clear about how we work. p  pWe have several work itens some are user stories and some are bugs. When a developer checks in code he or she associates hisher check in with those user stories that gets the Resolved state and a Gated x.x.x.x in the integration build field. We never test gated builds. Instead, every night we manually trigger a build and those work itens gets updated again, but this time with a Release x.x.x.x in the integration build field. In the next day we test those work itens but the process continues and developers keep check in more US or Bugs that will have the Gated .... p  pSometime we get confused and we test work itens that should not be tested because they are in the Gated state.p  pEven if we have branches that will not solve our problem because the developer associates a check in with work itens and we cant change that.p  pWe do not test gated builds because our QA team is small. The dev team have 20 developers and the QA team have only 2. The process of deploy the application takes about 10 minutes and it can be a pain to wait 10 minutes on every developer check in. Also changing the code while we are testing is never a good idea because it can mess up with our test.p  pSomebody can think that our process is wrong and suggest a new approach. This will be very welcome, but what we do is working very well besides that small issue.p

Negative 4956 pIm using Grails and jqGrid and am trying to get a rather strange extension working I want to let the user upload a file that will be passed to the jqGrid controller and used to filter the data.  For example the file is a list of names and the grid will be filtered to rows containing those names.  Is there any simple way to do thisp  pWhat I have been trying is to use AJAX fileuploader with a FormData object and trying to attach it to the jqGrid params.

Negative 4956 pI have to write a program in which I have to create a singly linked list dictionary in alphabetical order. Then have the words in the dictionary searched in a text file then do a intersect method to see if any words intersect. So far I have created the text file as well as created the two nodes and done the mapping to search for how many times each word appears in this text file.  I am completely lost on how to create the singly linked dictionary. I was planning on creating two linked listsEach with about 5 words in them and then running an intersection alogirthm method.

Negative 4956 pIt seems that to make responsive site, layout should be Fluid. To make fluid layout many people use the width 90 .

So, it is very easy to calculate the width of other contents according to grid.p  pUnfortunately the frustrating moment is when I give 90 width to make responsive layout I see that the layout in browser is wider more than 960px. So, how can I calculate the layout according to 960px grid at 90 fluid layout width.  Or what is the procedure regarding to calculating of width during build responsive design p

Negative 4956 pHi i want to integrate a function from 0 to several different upper limits around 1000. I have written a piece of code to do this using a for loop and appending each value to an empty array. However i realise i could make the code faster by doing smaller integrals and then adding the previous integral result to the one just calculated. So i would be doing the same number of integrals, but over a smaller interval, then just adding the previous integral to get the integral from 0  to that upper limit. Heres my code at the momentp  precodeimport numpy as np                              importing all relevant modules and functions from scipy.integrate import quad import pylab as plt import datetime t0datetime.datetime.now                      initial time numnp.linspace0,10,num1000                  setting up array of values for t Ltnp.array[]                                 empty array that values for Lt are appended to def Lt                                       defining function for L     return np.cos2np.pit for g in num                                   setting up for loop to do integrals for L at the different values for t     Lval,xquadL,0,g                          using the quad function to get the values for L. quad takes the function, where to start the integral from, where to end the integration     Lvnp.appendLv,[Lval]                     appending the different values for L at different values for t codepre  pWhat changes do I need to make to do the optimisation technique Ive suggestedp

Negative 4956 pSo Im using Anaconda to run Python 2.7 32bit on my companys server.  That works dandy.  Anaconda came with MinGW, so Im attempting to use the g compiler in there.  Everything works for me.  I can compile c source, and then run the resulting executable.  The issue comes when  coworkers try to do the same.  Apparently, the g compiler creates a dependency for the executable it makes on a particular dll located within Anaconda.  I have a path variable to where this dll lives, my coworkers do not, thus, they cannot run any executable made by g. p  pIs there a way to specify where this dll dependency is when I compile executable so that anyone can use them  Something likep  precodeg someCode.cpp o someCode.exe locationOfDllpath2dll codepre  pJust to be clear, everyone can successfully compile c source code, but only I can run the resulting executable.

Negative 4956 pSay you had a Model called Forest. Each object represents a forest on your continent. There is a set of data that is common to all these forests, like forest type, area etc., and these can be easily represented by columns on the SQL table, codeforestcode.p  pHowever, imagine that these forests had additional data about them that might not always be repeatable. For example the 20 coniferous forests have a codepinefircode split ratio number, whereas the deciduous forests have a codeautumndurationcode number. One way would be to store all these columns on the main table itself, but there will be too many columns on each row, with many columns remaining unfilled by definition.p  pThe most obvious way around this is to make subclasses of the Forest model and have separate table for each subclass. I feel thats a heavy handed approach that I would rather not follow. If I need some data about the generic forest Ill have to consult another table.p  pIs there a pattern to solve this problem What solution do you usually preferp  pNOTE I have seen the other questions about this. The solutions proposed werep  ul liSubtyping, same as I proposed above.li liHave all the columns on the same table.li liHave separate tables for each kind of forest, with duplicated data like area and rainfall... duplicated.li ul  pIs there an inventive solution that I dont know ofp  pUPDATE I have run into the codeEAVcode model, and also a modified version where the unpredictable fields are stored out in a NoSQLJSON store, and the id for that is held in the RDB. I like both, but welcome suggestions in this direction.p

Negative 4956 pI programmed a C Winforms application. One of the forms allow to configure something, by mean of a PropertyGrid control. I have programmed TypeConverters for a property that is an object that works perfectly, but a little detail.p  pThe property shows a stardard value collection, whose elements are of type Simbologia. The target property is of type CodigoBarra.p  pThe process is as follows when the first element in the values collection is selected, the property assigns null and no object properties are displayed. When a different value is selected in the collection, the CodigoBarra properties expand, allowing to change the object properties individually.p  pAs I told, all that process work, however, the problem occurs when I set the collection as exclusive. When I press a key, the system is not able to convert from Simbologia to CodigoBarra.p  pI have tried with ConvertFrom methods, and even, I added an implicit cast to Simbologia class, but it did not help.p  pThe object I am configuring with the Propertygrid is called Equipo, and this is the definitionp  precodepublic class Equipo  IConfiguracion      [CategoryImpresora,      DefaultValuenull,      PropertyOrder16,      TypeConvertertypeofPropertyGrid.BarCodeConverter,      DisplayNameCdigo de Barras,      DescriptionDefinicin del cdigo de barra cuando se imprime el ticket.

To let the backend know, I send a PING using a UDP client connection.p  precode  Front End  Backend Setup                        Processing                                                                                Internet   Front   PING    Backend                       Client      End  gt                                                                      HTTP Request                                       v                                                                                                   FrontEnd                                                     PING      v                  v                  HTTP Response              v                            v                                                               Backend      Cassandra  Database                          Internet                                                       Client                          codepre  pWithout the PING, the backends ends its work and falls asleep until the next PING wakes it up. Although there is a failsafe, I put a timeout of 5 minutes so the backend wakes up once in a while no matter what.p  pMy question here is about the UDP stack, I understand it is a FIFO, but I am wondering about two parametersp  ol lipHow many PING can I receive before the FIFO gets fullpli lipMay I receive a PING and lose it if I dont read it soon enoughpli ol  pThe answer to these questions can help me adjust the current waiting loop of the backend server. So far I have assumed that the FIFO had a limit and that I may lose some packets, but I have not implemented a way to allow for packets disappearing i.e. someone sends a PING, but the backend takes too long before checking the UDP stack again and thus the network decides that the packet has now timed out and removes it from under my feet.p  hr  pUpdate I added a simple processing to show what happens when it is time based from top to bottomp
Negative 4956 pI was wondering if its possible to writemodify renderscript code when the android application is running.  My main goal is to make an app where users can learn to work with renderscript without any java knowledge. The basic layout of the app would consist of an input and output image, with the possibility for code input. The basic functionality of this app is already working and this is an image of the interface. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6Qpmm.png altApp layoutp  pIt would be useful to test renderscript code with direct feedback from the app.p  pemIve already done research about the build process and came up with the following ideaemp  pA basic template renderscript file, with the necessary global variables like in and out allocations. p  pMy java code would create a script object of the generated java class and do the basic initialization of these global script variables. The root function of this template .rs file would be empty, and it should be possible to be implemented by the user at runtime.p  pWhen the user types in his code in the main view of the app, the code is written to my own .rs file which then is compiled by the llvmrscc compiler, invoked by the application. The generated .bc would then be copied to the location of the original .bc file of  the template. Because the only change of code happens inside the root function, it would not be necessary to make changes to the surrounding java code.p  pThe problem Im having at the moment is the fact that the .bc files are bundled within the final apk inside the resraw folder, which is not accessible by the app. Overwriting old .bc files with the newly generated files is therefore not possible. p  pstrongIs there another way to compile renderscript code at runtimestrongp  pstrongEdit Solution can be found in this a hrefhttpsgithub.comdegoossezOVSR relnofollowgithuba link.

Negative 4956 pWhen studying the sample code for a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23283188this questiona I had assumed it was Undefined Behaviour which was preventing subsequent uses of codestdcoutcode from printing. But it turns out that a hrefhttpideone.comB06vm0 relnofollowattempting to print a null pointer caused codestdiosbasebadbitcode and codestdiosbasefailbitcode to be set in its stream statea which was the real cause for its being nonoperational. Because of this, I am now curious if it really emisem Undefined Behaviour to attempt to print a nullpointer. So here   are my questionsp  ol lipIs it Undefined Behaviour to print a nullpointer If so, what is it about the stream inserter that would cause this Im pretty certain the inserter is smart enough to not dereference a nullpointer.pli lipI would also like to know why the inserter sets its error mask when encountering a nullpointer in this context specifically codebadbitcode. Why doesnt it treat it like the termination of a string literalpli ol  pI dont have a Standard handy, and I only found one source thus far that unfortunately led to a dead link.p

Negative 4956 pIs there any callback function available, which is triggered while we attach a texture map to a material using the slate material editor.p  pReasonbr I have a custom material and if the user dont have a valid license I dont want him to attach any texture to the custom material. In the Compact material editor I achieved this by disabling the UI to create map. But when I am using the Slate material editor I can connect a texture to my material.p  pSo my idea is if I get a call back function from slate material editor when I tries to attach a map, I can perform a licence check and stop him from creating the connection. Am I doing it right or do you guys have any alternate suggestions.p  pThanks,br Saneeshp
Negative 4956 pIm trying to draw an imported DXF file using WPF over a canvas. Ive been using DXFLib available a hrefhttpsgithub.commkernelDXFLib relnofollowherea to read and parse various files and it seems to work really well.p  pIm now in the process to draw all the entities in the DXF but Im stuck with ARC.

Negative 4956 pMy Windows Computer Has a local git repository R1 for a Visual Studio project. The remote origin for this repository is GitHub. They are identical with just a Master branch. All of the commits have been pushed to GitHub.p  pNAS local y drive Has an unused git repository R2 that was created init bare and nothing else has happened here.p  pWhat I would like to do I think is have the R2 the origin remote of R1, and GitHub the origin remote of R2. Development would occur in R1 or other R1.x on different PCs with commits pushed to R2. When it makes sense, the R2 branches would be pushed to GitHub. p  pWhat I am not exactly sure about is how I get from where I am to where I want to be without making a mess of things. Any helpdirection would be most welcome. Thanks, Jonp

Negative 4956 pI have an excel file that will select roughly 1100 rows with 5 columns of data. Most columns are 5 digits long and are integers. I am using a macro to connect to a SQL server database and  insert these rows into one maybe two tables. This is all its doing and then it closes the connection. So the user opens an excel file that has the rows, clicks a button and it executes the macro. p  pMy question is, should the query be written in Excel since its simple and merely inserts the data into a few tables. Or is it more efficient calling a stored procedure and passing all of the values in the stored procedure and have it allocate where the values go in the different tables. When I mean efficient, i mean which is the quickest I know this will probably take a few seconds to complete. I just feel going to a stored procedure is an extra point along the path that the data has to get to before it reaches the tables. Am I wrong Any thoughtsp

Negative 4956 pIm developing a web application, and Im trying to wrap my head around the best authentication system to use.  Basically, I want the client to send my server a username and password, and I want the server to respond by giving the client a token that can be used in lieu of a password from that point forward.p  pIve looked into this a little and a recommendation I keep seeing is to use an HMAC with a secret key known only to the server.  I see the benefit of this method, but it still seems to me that this isnt ideal, since as far as I am able to tell it cannot be expired.  p  pI can add extra security by adding the ip address to the string used for creatingverifying the hmac, I believe, but Im still not sure if this is the best way.p  pIs there any reason not to just have my authentication token simply be generated with something like opensslrandompseudobytes and stored in my database along with an ip address and username  Then I can just send the user that and verify it against whats in the database.  It also allows me to easily expire or log out the user.p

Negative 4956 pSo Im still trying to understand the asyncawait pattern, but Im also trying to achieve the following behaviorp  pA method A calls method B which runs a number of processes. Some of those processes can be run on separate threads while other things are being processed so that their return values will be available closer to when they are needed. Method B needs to not return control to the caller until all of these processes are completed.p  pHere is the test code that I am working withp  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args      CallProc     Console.WriteLineProgram finished     Console.ReadKey   public static async Task CallProc      var two  Task.Factory.StartNew gt SomeSynchronousProcessIDontOwn5000, two     var one  Task.Factory.StartNew gt SomeSynchronousProcessIDontOwn500, one     var three  Task.Factory.StartNew gt SomeSynchronousProcessIDontOwn1500, three       some process happens here      var oneMessage  await one  waits until one finishes and then snags its value     Console.WriteLineGot message 0, oneMessage       some more stuff happens here      var twoMessage  await two  waits until two is finished and then snags its value     Console.WriteLinetwoMessage       TODO need to make sure that everything is completed before returning control to caller   public static string SomeSynchronousProcessIDontOwnint delayTime, string message, bool delay  true      Console.WriteLineStarting 0, message     ifdelay Thread.SleepdelayTime     return string.FormatFinished 0, message  codepre  pRight now, what is happening is that everything words as I expected except that the method is returning before everything is finished, so the output shows Program finished while two is still running.p  pHow do I write this so that codeCallProccode can execute those tasks asynchronously but delay returning until everything has been completed. In other words, codeCallProccode needs to run some tasks asynchronously, but codeCallProccode itself needs to be called synchronously.p

Negative 4956 pIm using ImageMagick to convert a few hundred thousand PDF files to PNG files.  ImageMagick takes about ten seconds to do this.  Now, most of these PDF files are automatically generated grading certificates, so its basically just a bunch of PDF files with the forms filled in with different numbers.  There are also a few simple raster images on each PDF  I mean, one option is to just throw computing power at it, but that means money as well as making sure they all end up in the right place when they come back.  Another option is to just wait it out on our current computer.  But I did the calculations here, and we wont even be able to keep up with the certificates we get in realtime.p  pNow, the option Im hoping to pursue is to somehow take advantage of the fact that most of these files are very similar, so if we have some sort of precomputed template to use, we can skip the process of calculating the entire PDF file every time the conversion is done.  Id do a quick check to see if the PDF fits any of the templates, run the optimized conversion if it does, and just do a full conversion if it doesnt.p  pOf course, my understanding of the PDF file format is intermediate at best, and I dont even know if this idea is practical or not.  Would it require making a custom version of ImageMagick  Maybe contributing to the ImageMagick source code  Or is there some solution out there already that does exactly what I need it to Weve all spend weeks on a project, then had this happen, I imaginep
Negative 4956 pIm learning C and I have a question about a little problem that I had. Bear with me, Im not going to write a full program just the segment of one for concision.p  pWhen writing a program that asks for a character and an integer to create a triangle with said character and to the integer dimensions I ran a problem where, once I prompted for the character, the value of an entirely different variable codeint xcode was changed to 0. I solved the problem and got the program to work, but I dont completely understand why this was happening.p  pFor examplep  precodechar sym[1]     int x printfnumbern asking for integer scanfd, ampx reading and assigning x to the value printfsymboln asking for the character scanfs, ampsym reading and assign sym to the character printfd,x printing the integer printfs,sym printing the character codepre  pMy output for codexcode would change to 0 no matter what was read into it. This only occured AFTER reading the character.p  pWhen I change codechar sym[1]code to codechar sym[8]code or so, it doesnt change the value of codexcode.p  pI know this must be some memory allocation thing, but does anyone know the details of why this happens I know that changing the array size for codesymcode makes the difference, but why would that change the value of variable codexcodep

Something likep  precode  app.directivevalidateForms, function          var form  angular.elementelem       scope.isSubmitted  false        form.bindsubmit, function            scope.isSubmitted  true           ifform.hasClassnginvalid return false            codepre  pAnd this directive is applied to the  element in the view.p  precodeltform namerequestinfo idrequestinfo validateformsgt codepre  pI have been tasked with displaying error messages below the fields containing invalid data. My thinking is that I should create a 2nd directive that applies the error messages so that different validation directives and different error display directives can be used on the various forms within the app. p  pSo in a 2nd directive, Im trying to watch something that tells me the form has been submitted and to display error messages where necessary. I tried to set a variable, isSubmitted, that would change to TRUE onsubmit, but the 2nd directive doesnt seem to be seeing when that variable changes.p  precodeapp.directiveshowErrMsgs, [timeout,         functiontimeout              return                  restrict  A,                 link  functionscope, element, attrs                      scope.watchisSubmitted, function                           timeoutfunction                               alertscope.isSubmitted                              call function to display error messages                                                                     ] codepre  pAnd this directive is applied to the  element in the view.p  precodeltform namerequestinfo idrequestinfo validateforms showerrmsgsgt codepre  pThe expected behavior was that clicking the submit button would change the value of isSubmitted and trigger the alert with its value for now. Sadly, there was no alert at all... which leads me to believe one or both of the followingp  ol lipthe 2 directives are in different scopes and thats why changes in one are not being detected in the otherpli lipIm going about this completely wrong and it cant be done like this.pli ol  pCan anyone show me where Im going wrongp

Still the DIV I want to show only once appears every single scroll movement. In the console, you will see one 1, followed by a series of zeroes. So the resetting of the variable works, but the comparator doesnt. Also the zeroes keep coming as you scroll, so basically the scroll detection keeps working even though it shouldnt.p

Negative 4956 pI have a large list 10k of user interests. Each list is fairly long and contains some user interests, e.g. [football, boxing, movies ..], and varies from user to user. So the data is quite highdimensional.p  pNow, I want to compute the pairwise similarity between each list. Actually, to be specific, for a certain list, I want to get the nmost similar lists, where n is arbitrary. Im using scikit for this, and thus far, Ive just been vectorizing the lists and computing the cosine similarity between each list. This, understandably, seems to be quite slow and doesnt scale well to large but sparse datasets. Would I be better served using something like a kdTree or a BallTreep

Negative 4956 pHere is a great SO answer which covers the creation of selfsigned CA and then signing executables with the obtained certificates a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions84847howdoicreateaselfsignedcertificateforcodesigningonwindowsHow do I create a selfsigned certificate for code signing on Windowsa.p  pI have read a lot of discussions online on how the driver signing works and the answer seems to be almost unequivocally that you cant load unsigned or selfsigned drivers without having the test mode enabled. However, the answer I linked to and especially one comment by Roger Lipscombe seems to provide a contradicting view p  blockquote   pIf you want to use this for signing drivers, you need to import the CA   certificate into the machine store. My example imports it into the   user store, which is fine for most software, for testinternal   purposes.p blockquote  pTo me, it looks like I would be able to install drivers with selfsigned certificates issued by a selfsigned CA as long as the CA cert was imported to the machine store. I wont have to make any other changes to the system disabling test mode by pressing F8 on boot menu, messing with boot configuration flags such as TESTSIGNING or NOINTEGRITYCHECKS.p  pAm I correct What are the obstacles, if any, that this method is not used more widely when people need to load drivers that have no proper digital signatures provided such as old printer drivers etc.. Instead, people rely on booting to test mode or a thirdparty software DSEO which tampers with your system files to run such drivers. p  pWhat are the drawbacks of this method The process described in the above SO question needs admin privileges but installing drivers should need them anyway. Trusting a selfsigned CA might be a security risk  but wont disabling all signature checks be even bigger security riskp

Negative 4956 pWe have a web application that uses codeSignalRcode to send messages to the client.  While running the application in Visual Studio 2013 debug mode with browser link disabled in Chrome and IE we find that the codeSignalRcode hub appears to connect, but does not appear instantiate the information needed for a client to receive the servers sent messages. When we stop the server the Chrome client starts throwing codeconsole.logcode errors that codeSignalRcode cannot connect to the server. Firefox appears unaffected by this problem and works as expected with codeSignalRcode while debugging with browser link disabled.  Browser link uses codeSignalRcode to work its debug magic, but it can be a little bit intrusive when trying to debug javascript, so we have browser link disabled.  When running the application without Visual Studio debug the codeSignalRcode client works fine in Chrome.p  pIs there a way to run Visual Studio 2013 debug mode with browser link disabled and still have codeSignalRcode work as expected in Chrome or IEp

Negative 4956 pSo I am looking at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29343533isitmoreefficienttoperformarangecheckbycastingtouintinsteadofchecthis questiona and the general consensus is that uint cast version is more efficient than range check with 0. Since the code is also in MSs implementation of List I assume it is a real optimization. However I have failed to produce a code sample that results in better performance for the uint version. I have tried different tests and there is something missing or some other part of my code is dwarfing the time for the checks. My last attempt looks like thisp  precodeclass TestType      public TestTypeint size              MaxSize  size         Random rand  new Random100         for int i  0 i lt MaxIterations i                      indexes[i]  rand.Next0, MaxSize                    public const int MaxIterations  10000000     private int MaxSize     private int[] indexes  new int[MaxIterations]      public void Test              var timer  new Stopwatch          int inRange  0         int outOfRange  0          timer.Start         for int i  0 i lt MaxIterations i                      int x  indexes[i]             if x lt 0  x gt MaxSize                              throw new Exception                            inRange  indexes[x]                  timer.Stop          Console.WriteLineComparision 1   inRange    outOfRange  , elapsed   timer.ElapsedMilliseconds  ms          inRange  0         outOfRange  0          timer.Reset         timer.Start          for int i  0 i lt MaxIterations i                      int x  indexes[i]             if uintx gt uintMaxSize                              throw new Exception                           inRange  indexes[x]                   timer.Stop          Console.WriteLineComparision 2   inRange    outOfRange  , elapsed   timer.ElapsedMilliseconds  ms         class Program      static void Main              TestType t  new TestTypeTestType.MaxIterations         t.Test         TestType t2  new TestTypeTestType.MaxIterations         t2.Test         TestType t3  new TestTypeTestType.MaxIterations         t3.Test       codepre  pThe code is a bit of a mess because I tried many things to make uint check perform faster like moving the compared variable into a field of a class, generating random index access and so on but in every case the result seems to be the same for both versions. So is this change applicable on modern x86 processors and can someone demonstrate it somehowp  pNote that I am not asking for someone to fix my sample or explain what is wrong with it. I just want to see the case where the optimization does work.p

I have also tried initializing the var I want to set to code1code and then change it once the program is being ran but Im having no luck with that either, getting the same error.p  pEDIT The first two lines are the new codevarcode and new codeconst intcode Im looking to change and below are the lines that the errors seems to be originating from.p  precodeint objectIndexSize const int numOfObjects  objectIndexSize Mat imageArray[numOfObjects] Mat descriptorsArray[numOfObjects] vectorltKeyPointgt keypointArray[numOfObjects] String objectName[numOfObjects] String fileNamePostCut[numOfObjects] codepre

Negative 4956 pI am learning Spring and using Spring Recipes 3rd edition by Marten Deinum.  I just got to chapter 4 that focuses on spring mvc.  The examples are great except in this chapter they dont tell you how to deploy an imported gradle spring mvc project into a tomcat container.  Any idea on how I should do it  Normally when deploying a EE Java Dynamic web project you get to define the runtime target  in my case that would be tomcat v7.0.  I am importing the project and for some reason dont get to describe the target.  Any ideasp  pBest Regards, Steve Mansfieldp

The scenario presented in that question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24171010whitelistingdeeplynestedstrongparametersinrailswhitelisting deeply nested strong parameters in railsa is pretty much what Ive got going on, but Ill post an abbreviation of mine still very long and hope someonemaybe even the Dave of the postcan help I dont have enough reputation to comment and ask him. There are few links about nested strong parameters I havent read, and Ive dealt with some on many controllers and API endpoints, but this is the most complex in the app. Im including such a long example so you can see the full complexity.p  pThis is on the codesalescontrollercode, and one of the attributes we cant get to is the codetimezonenamecode, which is in the coderunspansattributescode, which is in the codeoptionsattributescode under codesalecode. Ive tried just about all of the different syntax approaches that match most of the nested attributes with strong parameters issues here on StackOverflow, but none of it has worked. Do I need more classes Are there magic brackets I need new suggestions. Please.p  pIt should be noted that this is with the strongparameters gem and Rails 3.2.21, but I want to get the app ready for Rails 4, so Im hoping to avoid a shortterm solution.p  pSorry its so longp  precode Parameters     salegt       clonedfromgt,       typegtLocalsale,       primarycontactattributesgt           primarygttrue,           firstnamegtFred,           idgt1712         ,       contractsignedongtMarch 20, 2015,       billingaddressesattributesgt           0gt               billinggt1,               citygtSan Diego,               idgt29076                      ,       othercontactsattributesgt           0gt               firstnamegtFred,               destroygtfalse,               idgt170914             ,           1gt               firstnamegtFred,               lastnamegtSmith,               destroygtfalse,               idgt1798                      ,       opportunitydetailattributesgt           originalsalespersonidgt,           idgt10130         ,       productioneditorgt1868097,       eventsaleattributesgt           0gt               namegtissupersale,               valuegt0,               idgt15326             ,           1gt               namegtsupershowcode,               valuegt             ,         ,       schedulingnotegt,       categoryidsgt[2, 364],       optionsattributesgt           0gt               titlegtTShirt and Bag Check,               eventstartsat1igt2015,               eventstartsat2igt6,               eventdoorsopenatattributesgt                   optionidgt8682604,                   doorstime1igt,                   idgt278382                 ,               eventoptionattributesgt                   0gt                       namegteventduration,                       valuegt                     ,                   1gt                       namegtsendpreeventemail,                       valuegt1,                       idgt632546                                      ,               languageidgt1,               runspansattributesgt                   0gt                       timezonenamegtEastern Time US amp Canada,                       destroygtfalse,                       idgt560878                     ,                   1429320288130gt                       timezonenamegtEastern Time US amp Canada,                       destroygtfalse                                      ,               destroygtfalse,               idgt8682604               ends 0 option           ,ends options       couponsperredemptiongt1,       methodsattributesgt           0gt               redemptioncodegt0,               destroygt0,               idgt9797012             ,           1gt               redemptioncodegt4,               destroygt1,               vendorprovidedpromocodegt0,               promocodegt                      , ends redemption methods       addressesattributesgt           0gt               streetaddress1gt2400 Cat St,               primarygt0,               idgt2931074,               destroygtfalse                      ,       zoomgt,       videoattributesgt           youtubeidgt,         ,       updatedfromgtedit        codepre  pHelp me do this right By the way, all kinds of  code.tap do whitelistedcode approaches have failed.p  precode private  defsalestrongparams     params.requiresale.permithow, the, heck, do, theattributes gt        [make, themselves gt [known, outside gt [of, these gt [darn,         parentheses], and], brackets]]  end codepre
Negative 4956 pI cloned a python package from github and I installed it using setup.py. But unless I am in that directory using import name of package does not work. How can I use this package for another project another directory I created a virtual environment with conda, installed the dependencies for this package, then with this environment activated I ran python setup.py and it compiled some C files etc. Did I miss a step  If I  run python in this directory and then use import it works, if I do it from another directory it does not work.p

Note this is a recursive implementation where The method codesendcode calls itself to get the following packet to send over the protocol. The problem is that when it calls codesendcode delayed codepkt.iatcode seconds, the execution of send will die at that codecallInThreadcode call, which strongis supposed to spawn a new thread and continue with the execution of codedosomestuffcodestrong, right All this code is actually running in another twisted thread, meaning that at some point we are calling from outside codecallInThreadpacketsender.send, pkt0code.p  pDo you have any clues about what might be happening Is there something Im missing about how Twisted threads workp

Negative 4956 pI am interested in using CoreAnimation to move views around, but I am wondering if it is possible to do this without causing a layout each frame of the animation.p  pIn particular, Im familiar with animating the constant attributes of a NSLayoutConstraint so that views move. Presumably, this will cause the the autolayout constraint solver to run at every tick of the animation since the constraints have changed. Is it possible to move views without causing this to occurp  pFor comparison, using HTML and CSS, you can animate the transform property in order to move elements without causing a layout. Is there anything like this for Cocoa or Cocoa Touchp

Negative 4956 pLet me start off by saying I tried to research this, but Im unable to word it to where I wouldnt get irrelevant results. p  pSo heres the issue. I have a button actually, 6 buttons which have a rounded corner appearance. Theyre saved as PNGs, and loaded into the button using button.BackgroundImage  [resource]. Five of them work perfectly fine. When theyre clicked, the background image is changed and, again, looks fine  including changing back when the button is no longer pressed. Then theres the button in the screenshot below.p  pI have no clue where this green color is coming from  in fact, when I go pixelbypixel over the image using GetPixel, and check the ARGB values, they turn out to be purples with A  0. Also confusing is that the green only shows up at runtime  as shown in the image. According to PhotoShop and GiMP, the RGB is 46,139,86 .. GetPixel shows them to be various colors in the purple range, but as an example, at 0,0 it shows 164,119,182 A0.p  pHeres the list of things Ive tried some pseudocodep  ul liif pixel.A  0  SetPixelx,y,Color.Transparent   No changeli liif pixel.A  0  SetPixelx,y,Form1.TransparencyKey   See through to desktop instead of form background as expected. li liUse a known good image see screenshot  No change. li liDelete control, copy and paste a known good control see screenshot  No change. li liAdd another control, hoping I could hide the flawed one and basically just ignore it.  All new buttons have this issue. li liMove button to different area of form long story.  No change. li liSet no background in designer, then set the background in Form1.Load.

Negative 4956 pThis drives me nuts. In the Visual Studio WinForms designer, if you doubleclick a control it will produce a XXXXLoad handler for that control. This is never, ever, what you want. You want Click event or a Changed event or more likely to go to the existing Click event. You do NOT was a new Load event. It is worse because a double click can happen by accident. You click once, then again  bingo a Load event handler. I use a pentablet combo and double clicks are very easyp  pCan someone tell me if there is a way to stop this happening. I would like a Click handler. I would settle for nothing happening. p

But when you execute the codecrontabcode command e.g. codecrontab u xxx ecode, you need to interact with an editor to modify the users crontab file. Suppose I dont know where the file is. For new users, codecrontabcode will generate a new file anyway. And I dont execute the command as the coderootcode user.p  pSo the question is, how can I just execute codecrontabcode in Python Is there any way to avoid interacting with an editor to modify the users crontab file in Python p  pMy OS is ubuntu 14.01.p

Negative 4956 pThis is the scenario which has been working for years. I have a parent asp.net web application at say www.MySite.co.uk and under it I have multiple child client sites in virtual directories  e.g. www.MySite.co.ukClient1 etc. All sites parent and child virtual directories are traditional asp.net web forms applications using .NET 4.5 and all working fine.p  pYesterday, I updated my parent site to be an asp.net MVC 5 web application developed for me by a freelancer. I only updated the parent site and it broke all my child sites. As an emergency fix for this I have renamed the web.config file in my parent MVC site, obviously this has broken my parent site, but at least the client child sites are working again.p  pThere is obviously a setting in the root application the MVC one which the webforms sites are inheriting and they dont like it.p  pIn my research I came across this a hrefhttpforums.iis.nett1200821.aspxCreatingvirtualdirectoryforASPNETwebsiteunderMVCapplication relnofollowhttpforums.iis.nett1200821.aspxCreatingvirtualdirectoryforASPNETwebsiteunderMVCapplicationa and so I wonder if the setting in question is to do with my MVC RouteConfig.cs file.

But it did not work, the client sites still didnt work.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pI have a response from my freelancer who says it is about routing and URL because MVC expects something to be at Client1 etc. So we need to write a route which sends such requests route plus one word to a controller which then needs to see whether this is a page in the MVC e.g. help or a client site e.g. Client1 and display appropriate page.p  pPersonally I dont know enough about routing to do this myself, but my freelancer is on the case. If he comes up with a solution I will post it. I would still appreciate any other input or alternative solutions.p  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pNow solved Please note, it was nothing to do with MVC, that was a red herring. Thanks to Greg Burghardt for pointing me in the right direction with his comment Apparently IIS tries matching a virtual directory first, then an MVC controller. This is true, there are strongno routing issuesstrong with having ASP.NET Web Forms sites in virtual directories under an MVC parent site. It was to do with web.config Entity Framework inheritance issues. I will post the answer.p
Negative 4956 pI am trying to create a new project that uses Cocoapods and Parse. I first created the project and then setup Cocoapods.

Negative 4956 pI built a simple text processing script at work to be used by another program.

Negative 4956 pIm refactoring an app I made some time ago. Back then I was taking my first steps into Android and the easy way to go was to avoid orientation changes, for almost all my CRUD operations I used the codeAsyncTaskcode class, didnt implement a Content Provider or used Fragments.p  pNow I have made some changesp  ul liI use codeFragmentcodes to encapsulate functionality li liAll accesses to my database are done through a codeContent Providercodeli liI use codeCursorLoadercodes to retrieve my data taking advantage of the content      observation and automatic background loading the codeLoaderFrameworkcode brings.li ul  pThe only problem I have now is that Im not quite sure how to handle the rest of the CRUD operations Create,Update, and Delete.  Ive found that I can use the codeAsyncQueryHandlercode class, but theres not enough information online. One thing I like the Loader Framework, is that is aware of the Activity or Fragment lifecycle, but what about the codeAsyncQueryHandlercode p  ul liWhat happens to the operations that were started with codestartDeletecode, codestartInsertcode, codestartUpdatecode when the codeActivitycodecodeFragmentcode undergoes a configuration change Or when I press the back button Or worse yet, if the activity is destroyedli liWhat is the expected behavior of this kind of operations in such cases Should they be cancelled or should they continue to do their workli ul  pAll the operations Ive mentioned above are not that complex. For real complex operations Ive used codeServicecodes or codeIntentServicecodes, but since I dont consider a good idea to run SQLite operations on the main thread I want to use a better solution, but first I need to know how that solution should react to the codeActivitycodecodeFragmentcode lifecycle events. p  pAny comments or suggestions would me greatly appreciated.

The following method is required for Part III.              sharkFeeding returns an integer that indicates the hunger of the shark      in cell x, y, using the same feeding representation as the parameter      to addShark described above.  If cell x, y does not contain a shark,      then its return value is undefinedthat is, anything you want.      Normally, this method should not be called if cell x, y does not      contain a shark.  You will need this method to help convert Oceans to      runlength encodings.      param x is the xcoordinate of the cell whose contents are queried.      param y is the ycoordinate of the cell whose contents are queried.        public int sharkFeedingint x, int y       Replace the following line with your solution.     return 0      codepre

If I place them under .vimsyntax and add line to .vimfiletype.vim everything works fine.p  pMy question is now how I can package my vim extension inside my debian package so that during installation the vim syntax highlighting is installed system wide and not only for the installing user root.p

Negative 4956 pI am trying to pair an iOS device to a single bluetooth adapter in a fleet of cars. It should be able to use all the typical services play music, make phone calls, etc.... I can control an application on the iOS device and I can get the MAC address of the bluetooth adapter, but I didnt pair exactly that adapter before.p  pThe pairing should work with as little user interaction as possible. Going to Settings  Bluetooth and adding it there works but is annoying if you are regularly changing cars. So I am looking for a way to pair from within the app. For example, we have an Android application which automatically starts pairing to a specific MAC address.p  pAfaik Core Bluetooth does work without pairing first in the Settings app, but it wont give access to the services mentioned above. It would only allow my application to transfer data. So currently my conclusion is that it is not possible to do any pairing for playing music or making phone calls from within the app.p  pCan anyone confirm this for me Can you think of any other improvement, like linking into the bluetooth settingsp

Negative 4956 pthe bug is basically didnt set the input length long enough. How do we call this kind of bug, NPEp  pmany problems with running javadoc stem from command lines that have become too long  even though the error message doesnt give the slightest hint this may be the problem.

Negative 4956 pI want to get exact reason behind having functions serializable in Spark and want to know the if possible want to know the scenarios, where can be issues because of Serialization,p  pAs far as my understanding goes, to ensure seam less no sideeffect parallel processing, instead of sending the data liike imperative paradigm, function will be sent to the node and data gets processed parallely.p  pIs my above thought Correct. As far as my study, Functional programming is a very good way forward for parallel processingconcurrent programming, so i thought this is the reason.p  pAs we are passing function, is it the security reason behind having functions serializable.p  pThanks In advance.p
Negative 4956 pIm having some problems importing a time variable from my database into MATLAB.

I have already build the application which has three mainPanel of which one is for login.  I am successfully able to pass the login credentials to mysql server and validate it, and user is able to see the main application after validation is done.  When user enters the credentials, user object is passed to mysql server through rpc and onSuccess loginMainPainel is removed from RootPanel and mainApplicationPanel is added to the RootPanel. Now I only want to know if I can take this login mechanism ahead and add session management to my application. What changes or additions do I need to dop  pThanks p

Negative 4956 pI have researched my predicament, here and across the web, integrating and modifying things in my project to the point where I feel things are correct from a configuration and build standpoint, but the issue remains.p  pMy development environment is NetBeans 8.0.2 and 8.1Beta, using Glassfish 4.0 as my app server, and using Maven as the build manager.  I have developed and built a library of EJBs which are installed on the server with no problems. I have built and deployed a NetBeans RCP application which accesses and uses the EJBs.  I then needed to build a standalone, command line application executable jar to access these EJBs to provide a report.  The application runs fine within the NetBeans IDE.  The standalone jar file fails, and here is where it gets interesting. My pom file uses the mavenjarplugin and the mavenassemblyplugin to build the jar file, including dependencies.  Since this is a remote application, I have a library where the remote interfaces to the EJBs are defined.

The issue is the same whether I use the 8.0.2 or the 8.1Beta of NetBeans.  I have tried the mavendependencyplugin to build the jar file, but then I get issues with signed jars, etc. To reiterate, things work as expected from a NetBeans RCP application and within the NetBeans IDE.  There seems to be something Im missing when it comes to getting an InitialContext from a standalone application.  Oh, and to be clear, I have a dependency on the gfclient library that is required for clients of glassfish apps. Anyone  Thanks.p

Negative 4956 pI am having trouble understanding what my frequency parameter should be in the following time seriesp  pI have hourly temperature for every day from April to November. To take care of missing data, I averaged the temperature per month at each hour.

When I plot the ACF of the TS with freq24, the lags occur at decimal values, which throws me off. However, the graph shows 8 periods, which makes logical sense because there are 8 months.
