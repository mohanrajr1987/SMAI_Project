Positive 30279 pWhich is the best, most tidy way to delete any attribute with name A, on an XmlElement and recursivelyp  pIve seen other similar questions but the answer is always the Attribute.Remove function, which is only available on framework 4.5 or superior. Im working on the 3.5 framework, and i have not found yet a way that convinces me.p  pAt the moment i have written something like thisp  precodeprivate void RemoveAXmlElement elem      if elem null              elem.RemoveAttributeA, elem.NamespaceURI          IEnumerator nodeList  elem.ChildNodes.GetEnumerator         object next  nodeList.MoveNext         while next  null                     RemoveAnext as XmlElement            next  nodeList.MoveNext                codepre  pWhich really strikes me as an awful way of doing it, especially for the use of an Object variable, and the namespaceURI in the remove attribute method why is there not an overload that searches the name within the current elementp
Positive 30279 pI encountered a problem with SortedList where 2 methods give 2 diffrent results.p  precodeItem Data is one of this sortedList item var itemPos  Items.IndexOfValueItemData Item item Items.TryGetValueitemPos, out item codepre  pThe result is not that obvious. I will operate on numbers rather on abstracts letters to better ilustrate what is happening.p  pitemPos is getting set to 5. Ok Next we try to get this item again form this index but no. It returns null. Ofcourse this is not happening immediately. This code is called before that happens.p  precode    public void MoveItemint indexFrom, int indexWhere              Item itemToSawp         Items.TryGetValueindexFrom, out itemToSawp         Items.RemoveindexFrom         Items.AddindexWhere, itemToSawp      codepre  pTo move items on sorted list we have to remove and add item again. Ok Debugging says that operation went wonderfully and my item have now index 5 i moved it from index 4. Where index 5 were empty before method MoveItem.p  pOr was it empty Before that operation i had index 5 filled with stuff and i called simple Items.Remove5p  pBut now happens what i described before.p  pWorth noting that this only is happening when i move item upwards in index, look from 45. When i move from 54 everything works correctly.p  pDo you have any idea what is going on over here Im using .NET 3.5p  pFull code  p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic  class Program      static SortedListltint, ItemDatagt Items  new SortedListltint, ItemDatagt      static void Mainstring[] args              var Foo  new ItemData         Items.Add0, Foo         Items.Add1, new ItemData         Items.Remove1         MoveItem0, 1         var itemPos  Items.IndexOfValueFoo         Console.WriteLineitemPos         Console should return 1 i think         ItemData item         Items.TryGetValueitemPos, out item           public static void MoveItemint indexFrom, int indexWhere              ItemData itemToSawp         Items.TryGetValueindexFrom, out itemToSawp         Items.RemoveindexFrom         Items.AddindexWhere, itemToSawp           class ItemData             codepre  pEDIT This is a bit confusing, but Indexer look at name of it P Take as argument KEY not INDEX. This is what get me confused and i mixedup everythig. So as Christoph said. Its better to use you own list you could use it as desire or read documentation deeply.p

Im trying to get cities based on the selected state both in 2 different codeComboBoxcodees with codeDropDownStylecode set to codeDropDownListcode.p  pI have implemented this logic in the codeSelectedIndexChangedcode event handler using the codeSelectedValuecode property. The codeDataSourcecode is a codeDataTablecode returned from a DB method, and codeSelectedValuecode returns an instance of codeDataRowViewcode.p  pstrongIn the form constructorstrong, I populate the state ComboBox and programmatically set the default state selection using codeSelectedIndexcode property this then goes to the event handler, strongexecutes properly, and populates the citystrong strongcodeComboBoxcodestrong for that state.p  pNow the problem comes when I change the selected state strongpostconstructionstrong, when the form is up amp running, using my mouse. This again goes to the event handler, but the codeSelectedValuecode property strongreturns a null referencestrong. Please help. Im attaching the code below.p  precodeprivate void comboFindStateSelectedIndexChangedobject sender, EventArgs e                       DataRowView selectedState             int selectedStateId             DataTable citiesTable              selectedState  comboFindState.SelectedValue as DataRowView               if selectedState  null Is true the first time around when the event is             triggered due to programmatic change of the index.

Its a mostlyempty application that does one thing, it calls out to a service, codeAssemblyServicecode, and streams over a helper assembly and executes it to setup the rest of the application.

Positive 30279 pMy requirement is to send emails within the web application from an external server that takes around 4 to 5 seconds on average to process and send the confirmation email. I do not want the user to wait for this, so i trigger a console application with Process.StartInfo.Start and it does it in background. The question is how much i can rely on this as during normal days the application sends around 10 thousand emails daily and in high traffic days it may surpass 80 thousand. What possible issuesproblems the application or server may run into Is there any better solution for thisp

Positive 30279 pI am trying to create an application that can open a .csv file, add some user inputted text to the end of particular lines, then save and close that file. Ive seen many many solutions that use ReadAllLines and WriteAllLines to achieve this but for certain reasons I am stuck using VS2008 and .NET 3.5 which apparently dont have those. I was wondering if anyone knows of an equivalent method to achieve these in 3.5. If I could create an array holding each line of text in the file, I could perhaps be able to access particular lines using their index in the array, add the text I want to them, then save the file. Sadly, I am not sure how to do this or if it is even possible. Im still fairly new to C so this might be complete gibberish but I hope it isnt If anyone has any suggestions for how I could possibly go about this, it would be much appreciated. Thank youp

Positive 30279 pIve recently stumbled upon some unintuitive behaviour of codeDecimal.Parsecode, Id like to discuss. The case is at follows. My program gets number as strings from other program, scientifically formatted its a black box for me. The strings are parsed using codeDecimal.Parsecode.p  precodeDim Value As Decimal  Decimal.ParseStrValue, Globalization.NumberStyles.Float, System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo codepre  pEverything was fine, until it tried to parse code1.9721522630525295e31code. On this string Decimal.Parse raises an OverflowException. Ok, I thought, lets try Double insteadp  precodeDim dblValue As Double  Double.ParseStrValue codepre  pThis works fine. Kind of the result is code0.0000000000000019721522630525295code. or codeDouble.ParseStrValue.ToString  1,97215226305253E15codep  pOk, next try.p  precodeDim dblValue As Double  Double.ParseStrValue, Globalization.NumberStyles.Float, System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo codepre  pWorks as expected, the codeE31code stays that way.p  pSo, this is my strong1st questionstrong why is Double.Parse behaving this wayp  pstrongeditstrong By this way I mean giving me a number 16 orders of magnitude greater then expected codeE15code instead of codeE31code. The question was stronganswerstronged by varocarbas the reason is my local decimal and thousands separators settings. The code.code in code1.9721522630525295e31code is treated by codeDouble.ParseStrValuecode like thousands separator i.e. ignored, and thus the Value becames code0.0000000000000019721522630525295code.p  pThen I did, like I always did before, convert the result to decimal.p  precodeDim decValue  CDecdblValue codepre  pNo exceptions but the value I got was once again code1.9721522630525295E15code.

Negative 30279 pProblem I have a method that compiles to over 8000 bytes of Java bytecode. HotSpot has a magic limit that makes the JIT not kick in for methods that exceed 8000 bytes. Yes, it is reasonable to have a huge method. This is a tokenizer loop. The method is in a library and I dont want to require users of the library to have to configure HotSpot to deactivate the magic limit.p  pObservation Decompiling the bytecode shows that Eclipse Java Compiler generates a lot of pointless gotos. javac is even worse. That is, there are gotos that are only reachable from jumps. Obviously, the jump that jumps to the goto should instead jump directly where the goto jumps and the goto should be eliminated.p  pQuestion Is there a bytecode optimizer for Java 5 class files that flattens pointless jump chains and then removes unnecessary gotosp  pEdit I mean patterns likep  precode8698   goto8548 8701   goto0 codepre  pObviously, the second goto can only be reached by a jump to 8701 which might as well be a direct jump to 0.p  pOn a second investigation, this questionable pattern is more commonp  precode4257   ificmpne4263 4260   goto8704 4263   aload0 codepre  pWhere obviously, one would like the compiler to reverse the not equal comparison to equal comparison, jump to 8704 and eliminate the goto.p

Negative 30279 pI would like to form a query where an associated collection has been restricted, ideally with Hibernate Criteria or HQL, but Id be interested in how to do this in SQL.  For example, say I have a Boy class with a bidirectional onetomany association to the Kites class. I want to get a List of the Boys whose kites lengths are in a range.p  pThe problem is that the HQLCriteria I know only gets me Boy objects with a complete unrestricted Set of Kites, as given in these two examples the HQL is a guess.

Im hoping some SQLHQLCriteria wizard knows a better way.  Id prefer to get a Criteria solution because my real Boy constructor has quite a few arguments and it would be handy to have the initialized Boys.p  pMy underlying database is MySQL.

There should be an effective in memory caching mechanism for frequently used keys.li liPersistent, but does not need to be transactional, can live with some failure. i.e. happy to synch with disk periodically, and does not need to be transactional.li liCapable of storing simple primitive types  but I dont need to store serialised objects.li liIt does not need to be distributed, i.e. will run all on one machine.li liSimple to set up amp free to use.li liNo relational  queries requiredli ol  pRecords keys will be strings or longs. As described above reads will be much more frequent than writes, and the majority of reads will simply be to check if a key exists i.e. will not need to read the keys associated data. Each record will be updated once only and records are not deleted.p  pI currently use Bdb JE but am seeking other options.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHave since improved query performance on my existing BDB setup by reducing the dependency on secondary keys. Some queries required a join on two secondary keys and by combining  them into a composite key I removed a level of indirection in the lookup which speeds things up nicely.p

Fantastic A button is then clicked forcing a Postback. In the if IsPostBack section of my code, I extract the Roles ItemCollection and print each item out, assuming to see any new items I added. Sadly, I only get the original items that were DataBound to the list.

Negative 30279 pSorry for the long explanation. Thanks in advance to all who are taking their time.p  pI am an Ubuntu user who has set up Titanium Developer on a MacMini in order to build an app for the iPhone and ultimately some other platforms.p  pRather than having any local code built in, the app simply points to my website. To do that, all I needed to do was change Titaniums strongtiapp.xmlstrong file to include my website URL. I wrote no other code, nor did I need to include any other files. It simply compiled and ran in the emulator without a hitch.p  pIve got just one problem I need to upload files to my website and Apple, as most of you know, has disabled the input field typefile. Ive got it working in all other browsers. The  action simply calls a php file and passes the file info.p  pemIfem I didnt have an app, and someone was just manually navigating to my site with the iPhones Safari browser, I could get around the problem by using CliqCliq, which is a very cool iPhone app. Basically, I use JavaScript window.open to launch CliqCliqs QuickPic browser in a second Safari window. The user chooses a file QuickPic uploads it and the user is returned to the second Safari window that I launched with window.open. The user closes the window and Safari returns them to the first window i.e., my website. p  pThe problem is that my website is being shown in my app. By the way, I dont have my developer license yet, even though I signed up a few weeks ago, and I cant test this in the emulator because I cant install QuickPic into it, I assume. I wanted to repeat the same steps, described in the previous paragraph, using an iFrame but that didnt seem to work i.e., the iFrame was blank despite my designating a src. I also tried having a hidden window by using oldfashioned frames and setting the colwidth to 0. That also did not work i.e., Safari, if I recall correctly, opened a separate window.p  pIm working a little blind, since I cant test anything on the iPhone, but I figure I have two options I can either find a way to launch a QuickPic in an iFrame or I can find some way to incorporate the Apple toolkit file chooser into the Titanium app. p  pThe problem with the first option  but again, I dont know until I can try this on the iPhone  is that I assume both apps mine and CliqCliqs could not run at the same time. Even if I had a hidden window, invisible iFrame, etc., the moment it launches QuickPic, I assume my app would quit.p  pThe problem with the second option is that I dont have clue as to how to incorporate a file picker into my app by using Titanium keeping in mind, everyone, that I know very little. Brian at CliqCliq has even offered to give me some code if I cant make Apples file picker work but again, Im not sure what to do next.p  pWhat do you folks think Whats the best method And, whats the easiest thing for a simpleton to dop  pThanks.p

Blend has an import option that we can use to convert some of the image resources in the project to XAML Path elements automatically. p  pOn the one hand by producing XAML the assembly will remain small. On the other hand there is a simplicity in just having an image reference.

Negative 30279 pIve written a custom widget for a control that we use widely throughout our application.  The widget class derives from codeImageButtoncode and extends it in a couple of simple ways.

Negative 30279 pBack in the old days of C, one could use array subscripting to address storage in very useful ways.  For example, one could declare an array as such. p  pemThis array represents an EEPROM image with 8 bit wordsem.p  precodeBYTE eepromImage[1024]   ...  codepre  pAnd later refer to that array as if it were really multidimensional storage p  precodeBYTE mpuImage[2][512]  eepromImage codepre  pemIm sure I have the syntax wrong, but I hope you get the idea.em  p  pAnyway, this projected a two dimension image of what is really single dimensional storage. p  pemThe two dimensional projection represents the EEPROM image when loaded into the memory of an MPU with 16 bit words.emp  pIn C one could reference the storage multidimensionaly and change values and the changed values would show up in the real single dimension storage almost as if by magic.  p  pIs it possible to do this same thing using C p  pOur current solution uses multiple arrays and event handlers to keep things synchronized.  This kind of works but it is additional complexity that we would like to avoid if there is a better way.p

Negative 30279 pIm trying to create a JavaScript script that will create a contextmenu of the users bookmarks. Ive had a look at the code of various extensions available in the Chrome Extension Gallery, but they are all very complicated and, to an extent, flawed most will only look inside a certain number of subfolders and then stop.

Negative 30279 pHey, folks. Im pretty new to jQuery and javascript in general and Im having a bit of trouble with the Autocomplete widget found in jQueryui. p  pIm trying to get a whole bunch of JSON data which I have pulled from a mySQL database and formatted with PHP in a rather specific way. I then want to format portions of this data into an array which is then used as the source for the autocomplete widget. p  pHere is the autocomplete bitp  precodevar dogs  []  .dogs .autocomplete     source dogs,     delay 10,  codepre  pPretty basic, and I can get it to work as expected. When I start in with the Ajax is when things get confusing.p  pMy JSON data is formatted code0actuActual Name0,dispDisplay Name0,1actuActual Name1,dispDisplay Name1, etc.code such that each dog has two names and a unique, numerical ID to make it easier to loop through the data.p  precodevar dogNames  [] .getJSONdataconditioner.php, functionjson       for var k in json         dogNames[k]  json[k][disp]           .dog .autocomplete option, source, dogNames  codepre  pThe goal here is to get all of the display names into a 1D array and then have the autocomplete use that array as its source. The array seems formed correctly as when I use codealertcode to print out results within the callback, I get the expected results. But for whatever reason the autocomplete does nothing when I use this array as its source. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 30279 pIm trying to setup a generic AJAX successerror handler with jQuery that I can use on multiple projects. My reasoning for doing this is because of a number of possible errors that could happen during an AJAX request. Here are the ones that Ive handled so far and there status numberp  ul li0 Unknown Errorli li1 Successfulli li2 Not logged inli li3 Timed outli li4 Not allowed based on permissionsli li404 Errorli ul  pFor the first 5 errors, Ive had to handle them manually. To do this, the only way I could find was is to run the codecl4.processajaxcode method inside the success function of an AJAX call with uses the status keyproperty in the JSON data to determine what the status is. For the 404 or some other AJAX error ie, unparsable JSON, Ive used the codeajaxErrorcode global event handler in jQuery.p  pThe basic idea is that an error will be displayed at the top of the screen inside codeajaxerrorscode when there is an error, sliding down to make it look pretty. Each of the errors can be clicked on to hide them.p  pHere is an example of how Id used it. codecl4.processajaxcode could also be put in an if clause only allowing the code to happen if it was successful.p  precode.getJSONpathtopagecajax1, functionreturndata      cl4.processajaxreturndata     if returndata  null ampamp typeof returndata  object ampamp typeof returndata.html  undefined          div.htmlreturndata.html      else          div.html       codepre  pThe query parameter codecajaxcode tells the login and permission checking to return a JSON array instead of redirecting the user to the login or no access page as it would normally.p  pThe messages that are displayed can easily be customized on the server just by including the errormsg keyproperty. This will make it easy to deal with things like translation and also make the code more flexible. Ive included the ability to display a debug message when in debug so during development its easy to determine what the error was vs the generic user message.p  pThe array thats JSON encoded should look something likep  precodearray    status gt the status using the constants in AJAX    errormsg gt message to be displayed the user at the top of the page    debugmsg gt message to be displayed in debug mode    html gt the html to display    ... any other data for that request  codepre  pThe following is the error handling codep  precode setup the cl4 object and the debug flag  these are typically else where and cl4 has other stuff in it var cl4   var cl4indebug  TRUE  probably default to false, but for this makes it easier to test  cl4.defaulterrormsg  There was a error loading some of the content on this page.ltbrgtTry reloading the page or contacting an administrator.    attach an AJAX error hander to the ajaxerror element  ajaxerrors.ajaxErrorfunction      cl4.addajaxerrorcl4.defaulterrormsg     Call within a ajax success function to deal with the response of an ajax call  cl4.processajax  functionreturndata      if typeof returndata  object  returndata  null          cl4.adddefaultajaxerrorreturndata         return false           if cl4.indebug ampamp typeof returndata.debugmsg  undefined ampamp returndata.debugmsg            cl4.addajaxerrorreturndata.debugmsg            check to see if weve received the status, because we need it for the rest     if typeof returndata.status  undefined          return           switch returndata.status           successful         case 1              return true             break          not logged in         case 2              cl4.adddefaultajaxerrorreturndata, You are no longer logged in. lta hreflogingtClick here to login.ltagt             return false             break          timed out         case 3              cl4.adddefaultajaxerrorreturndata, Your login has timed out.

Also, is there any better way of dealing with these types of errors within jQuery.

Users are allowed to configure overlapping slices these are the ones i need to sum up together. then I need to combine these slice row counts into a report. The way i am doing is by passing a string with MDX query to a report. but since i cant think of a way to get multiple queries into one executable string, nor do i know how many queries there will be this approach is no longer possible unless there is some way to union  sum them. p  pThe only way i could think of accomplishing this for now, is with additional embatchingem step that will iterate through all queries, process them using Adomd.net into a emstagingem table, and then i can aggregate them into a report using SQL sum... Biggest disadvantage to this approach being additional system to be maintained and more possibilities that the data in the report will be stale. p

I have created a div called lightpole this div contains a background image of a lightpole that is coded with javascript to match the height of the content div when the page loads. On the checkoutexpress page the creators of the CMS system have created expanding and collapsible divs that guide the user through the checkout process. On the third step Shipping Method the user clicks on the Continue button which expands the Order Confirmation Step. This div causes the content div to be longer than on initial loading but the lightpole was only sized to match the inital height of the content, not the added height of the Order Confirmation Step so it causes the lightpole to be shorter than it actually needs to be.p

Negative 30279 pI have a weird design pattern for one of my aps where I have a tool bar that acts as a tab bar. Basically I add this toolbar to all of my view controllers, and the tool bar itself contains pointers to the 3 different nav controllers in my app. When one of the toolbar buttons is pushed, it should be able to remove the nav controller that currently is on the window, and add the one the user has selected. My problem is Im not sure how to add the new navcontroller to the superview. Would I instantiate an app delegate object and add it to that Or would I need to send a pointer from my app delegate to the tool bar as a class variable Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 30279 pI have a three page Word document that needs to be converted into PDF. This Word document was given to me as a template to show me what the PDF output should look like. I tried converting this document into PDF, created a PDF form and used iTextSharp to open the form, populate it with data and return it back to the client. This is all great but due to large amounts of data stored, the placeholders were insufficient and the text would be truncated or hidden.p  pMy second attempt was to create an MVC 2 View without master page, pass the model to the view, take the HTML representation of the View, pass it over to iTextSharp and render the PDF. The problem here was that iTextSharp failed on some tags one of them was codelthrgtcode tag. I managed to get rid of the problematic tag, but then tables were not rendered properly. Namely, the border attribute was ignored so I ended up with borderless tables. That attempt failed.p  pI need a suggestion or advice on the most efficient way to create a PDF document in MVC 2 which would be maintainable in the long run. I really dont want my actions to be 200 lines long. Working directly with the Word document is not the best solution as I have never worked with VSTO so I dont quite know what it would look like to open Word and manipulate text inside of it and add dynamic data and then convert that dynamically into PDF.p  pAny suggestion is highly welcome.p  pBest regardsp

Negative 30279 pI have a very large data file, and each record in this data file has 4 lines. I have written a very simple C program to analyze files of this type and print out some useful information. The basic idea of the program is this.p  precodeint main    char buffer[BUFFERSIZE]   whilefgetsbuffer, BUFFERSIZE, stdin        fgetsbuffer, BUFFERSIZE, stdin     dosomesimpleprocessingonthesecondlineoftherecordbuffer     fgetsbuffer, BUFFERSIZE, stdin     fgetsbuffer, BUFFERSIZE, stdin      printoutresult  codepre  pThis of course leaves out some details sanityerror checking, etc, but that is not relevant to the question.p  pThe program works fine, but the data files Im working with are huge. I figured I would try to speed up the program by parallelizing the loop with OpenMP. After a bit of searching, though, it appears that OpenMP can only handle codeforcode loops where the number of iterations is know beforehand. Since I dont know the size of the files beforehand, and even simple commands like codewc lcode take a long time to run, how can I parallelize this programp

Negative 30279 pI have a winform RadTreeView that has long names for the nodes and in a small area of the application. When I click the checkbox next to the node name to check it, the node gets selected and the window scrolls right which prevents the check box from being checked and we have to scroll back to check the node. We can check the nodes with long names as long as it is already selected but when your checking a node that isnt selected it scrolls. Is there anyway to prevent the auto scrolling of the RadTreeView to the end of the node name We are running the latest version which it is suppose to be fixed in but it is still happening. Thanks p

Negative 30279 pI have written some code used to organize data sampled at different frequencies, but I made extensive use of forloops, which slow the codes operation down significantly when the data set is large.  Ive been going through my code, finding ways to remove forloops to speed it up, but one of the loops has got me stumped.p  pAs an example, lets say the data was sampled at 3Hz, so I get three rows for every second of data.  However, the variables A, B, and C are sampled at 1Hz each, so I will get one value every three rows for each of them. The variables are sampled consecutively within the one second period, resulting in a diagonal nature to the data.p  pTo further complicate things, sometimes a row is lost in the original data set.p  pMy goal is this Having identified the rows that I wish to keep, I want to move the nonNA values from the subsequent rows up into the keeper rows. If it werent for the lost data issue, I would always keep the row containing a value for the first variable, but if one of these rows is lost, I will be keeping the next row.p  pIn the example below, the sixth sample and the tenth sample are lost.p  precodeA lt c1, NA, NA, 4, NA, 7, NA, NA, NA, NA B lt cNA, 2, NA, NA, 5, NA, 8, NA, 11, NA C lt cNA, NA, 3, NA, NA, NA, NA, 9, NA, 12  testdf lt data.frameA  A, B  B, C  C  testdf      A  B  C  1   1 NA NA  2  NA  2 NA  3  NA NA  3  4   4 NA NA  5  NA  5 NA  6   7 NA NA  7  NA  8 NA  8  NA NA  9  9  NA 11 NA 10  NA NA 12  keeprows lt c1, 4, 6, 9 codepre  pAfter I move the values up into the keeper rows, I will remove the interim rows, resulting in the followingp  precodetestdf lt testdf[keeprows, ] testdf      A  B  C  1   1  2  3  2   4  5 NA  3   7  8  9  4  NA 11 12 codepre  pIn the end, I only want one row for each second of data, and NA values should only remain where a row of the original data was lost.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas of how to move the data up without using a forloop Id appreciate any help Sorry if this question is too wordy I wanted to err on the side of too much information rather than not enough.p

Using Symfony 1.4.13 and the admin generator, and Doctrine 1.2, and the edit page for a project tester makes no mention of the manytomany relationships, no hidden fields, etc. Could this be the reason, the datas not there so Doctrine removes it I didnt think it would be necessary to include it.p  pMy schema.yml is as follows, with irrelevant details removed.p  precodeBetaMeeting   connection doctrine   tableName BetaMeeting   columns     id               type integer4, primary true, autoincrement true      projectid       type integer4      date             type date    relations     Project       local projectid       foreign id       foreignAlias BetaMeetings     ProjectTester       class ProjectTester       refClass BetaMeetingAttendee       foreignAlias BetaMeetings  BetaMeetingAttendee   connection doctrine   tableName BetaMeetingAttendee   columns     betameetingid    type integer4, primary true, autoincrement false      projecttesterid  type integer4, primary true, autoincrement false    relations     BetaMeeting       foreignAlias BetaMeetingAttendees     ProjectTester       foreignAlias BetaMeetingAttendees  ProjectTester   connection doctrine   tableName ProjectTester   columns     id                   type integer4, primary true, autoincrement true      testerid            type integer4      projectid           type integer4    relations     Tester       local testerid       foreign id       foreignAlias Projects     Project       local projectid       foreign id       foreignAlias ProjectTesters codepre  pAny clue as to why the relationships get cleared out after an edit which is concerned only with the immediate attributes of the ProjectTester objectp
Negative 30279 pI am trying to lookup a value e.g. code123abc456code from a table but the column that I want to look up will have the format e.g. code123abc456code or code123abc456code.

Negative 30279 pI rewrote the original radix sort algorithm for Python from emWikipediaem using arrays from emSciPyem to gain performance and to reduce code length, which I managed to accomplish. Then I took the emclassicem inmemory, pivot based quick sort algorithm from emLiterate Programmingem and compared their performance.p  pI had the expectation that radix sort will beat quick sort beyond a certain threshold, which it did not. Further, I found a hrefhttperik.gorset.no201104radixsortisfasterthanquicksort.html relnofollowErik Gorsets Blogsa asking the question strongIs radix sort faster than quick sort for integer arraysstrong. There the answer is thatp  blockquote   p.. the benchmark shows the MSB inplace radix sort to be consistently over 3 times faster than quicksort for large arrays.p blockquote  pUnfortunately, I could not reproduce the result the differences are that a Erik chose Java and not Python and b he uses the emMSB inplace radix sortem, whereas I just fill embucketsem inside a Python dictionary.p  pAccording to theory radix sort should be faster linear compared to quick sort but apparently it depends a lot on the implementation.

We are getting there and I am certain that this is a much better approach it just needs some modification.  Thanks for your help so far Aurimis.p

Negative 30279 pIve written custom control which allows the user to change the codecurrentPlaybackTimecode of a codeMPMoviePlayerControllercode by clicking or dragging on a custom codeUIButtoncode that displays an image of some musical notation.

I also have a codeCALayercode a vertical red line that shows the user where they have touched on the control.p  pWhat Id like to do now is have the red lines CALayer object position update if the user changes the codecurrentPlaybackTimecode property of the movie player using the scrubber slider control.p  pObviously codecurrentPlaybackTimecode is always updating as the movie plays, but is there a way to detect if the user interferes with this by skipping forward or backwardsp  pMany thanks.p

I figured that time zone boundaries are mostly static and were probably decided by some committee, so there should be a CSV or GPX or KML somewhere.p  pId like to be able to check what time zone a coordinate lies in, for examplep  p48.856667 2.350833 is GMT1 or CETp
Negative 30279 pstrongWhy I ask this questionstrongp  pI know there have been a lot of questions about AES encryption, even for Android. And there are lots of code snippets if you search the Web. But on every single page, in every Stack Overflow question, I find another implementation with major differences.p  pSo I created this question to find a best practice. I hope we can collect a list of the most important requirements and set up an implementation that is really securep  pI read about initialization vectors and salts. Not all implementations I found had these features. So do you need it Does it increase the security a lot How do you implement it Should the algorithm raise exceptions if the encrypted data cannot be decrypted Or is that insecure and it should just return an unreadable string Can the algorithm use Bcrypt instead of SHAp  pWhat about these two implementations I found Are they okay Perfect or some important things missing What of these is securep  pThe algorithm should take a string and a password for encryption and then encrypt the string with that password. The output should be a string hex or base64 again. Decryption should be possible as well, of course.p  pstrongWhat is the perfect AES implementation for Androidstrongp  pstrongImplementation 1strongp  precodeimport java.security.MessageDigest import

Negative 30279 pThe standard factory Method design pattern talks of 4 classes. Creator,Product n their concrete implementations.p  pSo for each product we need to instantiate corresponding factory which has methods to create the product.p  pBut I have also seen scenarios where people declare constructor as private and have a static method that creates an object of the same class. Something similar to what we do with singletons.p  pFor example getByname is one of the static methods of InetAddress that returns one of its subclass  depending upon whats the parameter. and people call it factory method.p  pIs this also an example of factory method pattern  does it contain ifelseif inside the method to decode the parameter or switch statement  But isnt use of switch n conditional statements considered a bad OO design practice p

But when the indicator dissapear the Rememember Me Checkbox position is changed, its getting placed over the login button. It seems like the Indicator Dialog is wraping the content on the page.

Negative 30279 pI would like to use something like typedef in my C programs to enhance type safety.p  pAs an example, suppose I have two functionsp  precodevoid function1unsigned idOfType1 void function2unsigned idOfType2 codepre  pthen I can mistakenly pass idOfType2 to function1 and vice versa. I want the compiler to give me an error in this case. I am aware that I could wrap these unsigned in a struct, but then Id have to give provide a field name and use code.code to access them, which is slightly inconvenient. Is there a good way around thisp  pEdit As far as I know codetypedefcode will not work for this purpose as it is just a shorthand for a type and will not be used for type checking.p

Negative 30279 pI have a custom logging process that is reading from STDIN and sending the data out via TCP to a scribed logging server.

It works reliably under other operating systems though, including FreeBSD 8, Linux 2.6 and Linux 3.1.p  pHow can I find out what could be the reason for the uninterruptable sleepp  pThe overall structure is like this httpd  [PIPE]  serelog  [TCPCONNECTION]  scribedp  pUntil now I did the following analysisp  ul liUsing ps stat is D and wchan is . So there is apparently no syscall, which doesnt make too much sense to me, as the process in uninterruptable sleep and should be in kernel land.li liAs the process is in state D, the process does not react to kill 9 as expected.li liAttaching truss to serelog externally from a shell As long as truss is attached, serelog runs smoothly. Shortly Seconds after detaching truss from serelog, serelog goes into D state.li liWhen attaching truss to serelog AFTER it has entered D state, truss prints nothingli liIn D state, lsof shows that the incoming PIPE is full. This is exected, as in D state the process sleeps and cannot read any longer. The outgoing TCPCONNECTION is empty.li liIf I kill the surrounding Apache httpd server, the serelog process eventually terminates after e.g. 40 minutes.li liChecking what others report in forums about the uninterruptable problem was not successful In my setup there is no NFS. And as it is a server there is also no user interaction with CD drives or pluggable hardware.li ul  pSo I am now stuck with a process that is uninterruptable, is apparently not in a syscall, and works reliably when traced.

Negative 30279 pI am trying to understand how the receiver window affect the throughput over a high latency connection.p  pI have a simple clientserver pair of apps on two machines, far apart, with the connection between the two of 250mSec latency RTT. I ran this test with both Windows XP, 7, and Linux Ubuntu 10.x, with the same results, so for simplicity lets assume the case of Client receiving data WinXP Pro Server sending data Win7 Pro Again, latency is 250mSec RTT.p  pI run my TCP test without changing the receiver buffer size on the client default is 8Kb, and I see on the wire using Wiresharkp  ul lithe client send ACKS to the server and the TCP packets contains RWIN65kli liserver send data and report RWIN65kli ul  pLooking at the trace I see a bursts of 34 packets with a payload of 1460 bytes, immediately followed by the ACK sent from the client machine to the server, then nothing for approx 250mSec then a new burst of packets from the server to the client.p  pSo, in conclusion it appears that the server doesnt send new data even before it fills up the receivers window.p  pTo do more tests, I also ran the same test this time changing the receivers buffer size on the client machine on Windows, changing the receivers buffer size ends up affecting the RWIN advertised by the machine. I would expect to see large burst of packets before blocking for ACK... and at least a higher throughput.p  pIn this case I set recv buffer size to 100,000,000. The packets from the client to the server have now a RWIN99,999,744 well, thats nice, but unfortunately the pattern of the data sent FROM the server to the client is still the same a short burst followed by a long wait. To confirm also what I see on the wire, I also measure the time to send a chunk of data from the server to the client. I dont see ANY changes in using a large RWIN or using the default. p  pCan anybody help me understanding why changing the RWIN doesnt really affect the throughputp  pFew notes   server send data as fast as possible using write of chunks of 8Kb   as I said before, I see similar effects using Linux as well. changing the receiver buffer size affects the RWIN used by a node, but the throughput remains the same.   I analyze the trace after several hundred packets, to give enough time to the TCP slow start mechanism to enlarge the CWIN size.p  hr  pAs suggested, Im adding a small snapshot of a wire trace herep  precodeNo.     Time        Source                Destination           Protocol Length Info      21 2.005080    CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       sss.sss.sss.sss       TCP      60     57353 gt 21500 [ACK] Seq1 Ack11681 Win99999744 Len0      22 2.005109    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq19305 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      23 2.005116    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq20765 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      24 2.005121    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq22225 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      25 2.005128    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      946    21500 gt 57353 [PSH, ACK] Seq23685 Ack1 Win65536 Len892      26 2.005154    CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       sss.sss.sss.sss       TCP      60     57353 gt 21500 [ACK] Seq1 Ack14601 Win99999744 Len0      27 2.007106    CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       sss.sss.sss.sss       TCP      60     57353 gt 21500 [ACK] Seq1 Ack16385 Win99999744 Len0      28 2.007398    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq24577 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      29 2.007401    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq26037 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      30 2.007403    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq27497 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      31 2.007404    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq28957 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      32 2.007406    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq30417 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      33 2.007408    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      946    21500 gt 57353 [PSH, ACK] Seq31877 Ack1 Win65536 Len892      34 2.007883    CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       sss.sss.sss.sss       TCP      60     57353 gt 21500 [ACK] Seq1 Ack19305 Win99999744 Len0      35 2.257143    CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       sss.sss.sss.sss       TCP      60     57353 gt 21500 [ACK] Seq1 Ack22225 Win99999744 Len0      36 2.257160    CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       sss.sss.sss.sss       TCP      60     57353 gt 21500 [ACK] Seq1 Ack24577 Win99999744 Len0      37 2.257358    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq32769 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      38 2.257362    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq34229 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      39 2.257364    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq35689 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460      40 2.257365    sss.sss.sss.sss       CCC.CCC.CCC.CCC       TCP      1514   21500 gt 57353 [ACK] Seq37149 Ack1 Win65536 Len1460 codepre  pAs you see, the server stop sending data at packet 33.p  pClient send ACK at packet 34 of an old packet seq19305, sent on packet 20, not shown here.

My experience is more with applications that work outside but access data Client Object Model in Sharepoint 2010.p  pAt work I was recently tasked with the following requestp  ul lipCreate a custom announcement board where everyone can create an announcement but only admins and creators can edit it.pli lipThe main list page was going to provide a summary of the details, title and an icon that depicts the type of announcement gif of a baby if birth announcement.pli lipUpon clicking on an announcement, a detailed page containing more detail of the announcement and up to 4 pictures will be displayed.pli lipWhen entering data the pictures can only be a maximum size.pli ul  pHere is how I was going to attack this.  I was going to create a Custom List that allowed for the addition of Picture columns and all the other columns I required.  I would then modify the NewForm, EditForm and DispForm pages to meet our requirements.  Picture size would be controlled through Javascript of Jquery on the page.  My question to you experts out there is does this sound feasible Is there a better wayp  pThank you for any helpp

Negative 30279 pI need to manage a configuration file in Linux using a shell script, that will read and write settings to and from the codecfgcode file.

It accepts similarly two parameters, codekeynamecode and the source config file, and returns the codevaluecode of the supplied key.p  pNow the problem is that, I have config file as follows.p  precodenameAbc surnameXyz codepre  pAnd when I call the codesetsettingcode function as codesetsetting name Def homeConfig.cfgcode, ideally it should change value of codenamecode from codeAbccode to codeDefcode, but along with changing value of key codenamecode, it also changes the value of codesurnamecode from codeXyzcode to codeDefcode resulting into following in config file.p  precodenameDef surnameDef codepre  pI suspect this is due to having the term name common in both keys, as when I changed the key codesurnamecode to codesurnamescode, it worked as expected and only value of codenamecode was changed.

Negative 30279 pGood day,p  pI wasnt sure if I should post this on the software or hardware stack I apologize in advance if this is an invalid question.p  pI wrote a little application that I am using to make time lapse videos  currently it only takes the pictures using a webcam. I know there are already a few available for download, but none of them did 100 what I wanted, and some of them were a little buggy, so I decided Id rather create my own.p  pThe interval at which the pictures are taken can be configured anywhere from 5 seconds up. Version 1.x would activate the camera and keep it on while in Time Lapse Mode and save images to disc at the specified intervals. This approach proved to be very memory intensive  understandably, in retrospect.p  pI decided to start from scratch  Version 2.x. This version would keep the camera off and only switch it on when it needed to take a picture, and switch it off again. This approach proved much more efficient. The reason for the minimum limit of 5 second intervals is because the camera takes about 1 second to switch on and then roughly the same amount of time to switch off. Perhaps in the future I could change it to keep the camera on when the codeinterval lt 5code. For now, however, for what I actually want to use it, this will do perfectly.p  pWhen I was little we, as children, were told that switching an incandescent bulb on and off and on and off is not good for the bulb  according to a colleague of mine, reliable in that field, this is true.p  pThis got me thinking. Could it be harmful to my webcam if I switch it on and off at, say, 10 second intervals for, lets say, a day or two And how would switching on and off compare to keeping the device on for a few days I dont understand what happens on a hardware level so I cant say.p  pI suppose I have a couple of optionsp  ul liSwitch the application on and off as required to take the pictures. This could result in the camera being switched a few thousand times a day.li liKeep the camera on. This could mean the camera might be active for very long periods of time. What if I want to create a time lapse video over a month Or even a year Not to mention the memory problem.li liSwitch between the two modes. When codeinterval lt 2 minutes  keep on  switchcode. This seems like the best of both worlds but now Im faced with the memory problem when codeinterval lt 2 minutescodeli ul  pThank you in advance for any and all comments and suggestions  much appreciated.p  pKind regards, me.p

Briefly, a computation is distrubuted in processes and each one has a deque of threads to do the job. A process can push pop threads to from the bottom of its deque and other processes can work steal from it by popping threads from the top. Thus, work can be dinamically created by the push operation. The algorithm is the following.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfbUKM.png altSchedulling Algorithmp  pMy question is about the popTop work stealling function. I dont think it will work properly for all cases. For example, suppose a process A which has its queue Q and a process B that is trying to steal work from Q, calling popTop. Suppose also that B is preempted after line 2 of popTop and localBot  X at this moment. If A runs and popBottom until the bottom of Q lt X, when B resumes its run it will get a thread that already have been processed by A.p  pAre my thoughts correct I need to verify it because I will implement it to do work balancing in a CUDA program.p

Negative 30279 pIm trying to build a tool that uses something like regexes to find patterns in a string not a text string, but that is not important right now. Im familiar with automata theory, i.e. I know how to implement basic regex matching, and output true or false if the string matches my regex, by simulating an automaton in the textbook way.p  pSay Im interested in all codeacodes that comes before codebcodes, with no more codeacodes before the codebcodes, so, this regex codea[a]bcode. But I dont just want to find out if my string contains such a part, I want to get as output the codeacode, so that I can inspect it remember, Im not actually dealing with text.p  pIn summary Lets say I mark the codeacode with parentheses, like so codea[a]bcode and run it on the input string codebcadacbcode then I want the second codeacode as output.p  pOr, more generally, can one find out which characters in the input string matches which part of the regex How is it done in text editors They at least know where the match started, because they can highlight the matches. Do I have to use a backtracking approach, or is there a smarter, less computationally expensive, wayp  pEDIT Proper back references, i.e. capturing with parens and referencing with 1, etc. may not be necessary. I do know that back references do introduce the need for backtracking or something similar and make the problem IIRC NPhard. My question, in essence, is Is the capturing part, without the back referencing, less computationally expensive than proper back referencesp

The system generates a file every minute and each file contains the transactions of different users sorted by time, each file may contain thousands of users.p  pA sample data structure for a CSV filep  p103001,user 1,...BR 103001,user 1,...BR 103002,user 78,...BR 103002,user 2,...BR 103003,user 1,...BR 103004,user 2,...BR . . .p  pThe system I am planning should process the files and perform some analysis in realtime. It has to gather the input, send it to several algorithms and other systems and store computed results in a database. The database does not hold the actual input records but only high level aggregated analysis about the transactions. For example trends and etc.p  pThe first algorithm I am planning to use requires for best operation at least 10 user records, if it can not find 10 records after 5 minutes, it should use what ever data available.p  pI would like to use Storm for the implementation, but I would prefer to leave this discussion in the design level as much as possible.p  pA list of system componentsp  ol lipA task that monitors incoming files every minute.pli lipA task that read the file, parse it and make it available for other system components and algorithms.pli lipA component to buffer 10 records for a user no longer than 5 minutes, when  10 records are gathered, or 5 minute have passed, it is time to send the data to the algorithm for further processing. Since the requirement is to supply at least 10 records for the algorithm, I thought of using Storm Field Grouping which means the same task gets called for the same user and track the collection of 10 users records inside the task, of course I plan to have several of these tasks, each handles a portion of the users.pli lipThere are other components that work on a single transaction, for them I plan on creating other tasks that receive each transaction as it gets parsed in parallel to other tasks.pli ol  pI need your help with 3.p  pWhat are the best practice for designing such a component It is obvious that it needs to maintain the data for 10 records per users. A key value map may help, Is it better to have the map managed in the task itself or using a distributed cache  For example Redis a key value store I never used it before.p  pThanks for your helpp

Fromp  precodeselect c.icdr, v.icdrsconnection, c.icall, cs.name AS customername, a.username AS clientnameid, con.name AS connectionname, vn.name AS vendornameid, ca.setuptime, c.remoteip AS cremoteipid, con.destination AS vremoteipid FROM cdrs c JOIN Calls ca using icall JOIN cdrsconnections v using icall JOIN accounts a usingiaccount JOIN customers cs using icustomer JOIN connections con usingiconnection JOIN vendors vn using ivendor where icdrgt397233018 codepre  pTop  precodeselect c.icdr, v.icdrsconnection, c.icall, cs.name AS customername, a.username AS clientnameid, con.name AS connectionname, vn.name AS vendornameid, ca.setuptime, c.remoteip AS cremoteipid, con.destination AS vremoteipid FROM cdrs c JOIN accounts a usingiaccount JOIN customers cs using icustomer JOIN Calls ca using icall JOIN cdrsconnections v using icall JOIN connections con usingiconnection JOIN vendors vn using ivendor where icdrgt397233018 codepre  pThis is because cdrs table is linked to accounts table which is in turn connected to customers table. while vendors table is connected to cdrsconnections through connections table. So by placing these tables in order remove loops. Now Response time is really good.p

Negative 30279 pI am interested in devoting a good amount of time to improving my debugging ability and am looking for a list of core topics that I need to cover in order to be versed in the principles of commonly used and advanced debuggingtesting techniques.p  pInitially, I figured I would just read through the gdb documentation and glean debugging techniques from its functionality however, other than jumping into it to get the line number of a segfault and maybe running codebtcode, months later I am still resorting to mass codeprintfcodes as my default strategy. I feel this is because I dont have any well defined strategies that I could effect through more sophisticated means.p  pAlthough my question is in relation to CC, and although I operate within a UNIX environment, I would be willing to look at generalized material, or even topics covered in other languages if they will improve my understanding of key concepts.p

Negative 30279 pIm working with a third party product which has provided an API. This API works by creating an implementation of a base class, and then in the app.config indicating the implementation that you want to use.p  pThe problem with this is that its possible to have multiple projects in this third party application. What I would like to do is create a wrapper class which implements the base class. This would look at the parameters and then look up a configuration to determine which other class to pass the processing over to, depending on which project is being used. This way we could add future projects to the system without modifying any of the existing code.p  precodepublic class MyImplementation  ThirdPartyBaseClass      public override OnLoadThirdPartyType data              do stuff           public override ProcessThirdPartyType data              do stuff       codepre  pThere are about 15 methods that can be overridden. The base class methods appear to be empty because nothing happens if you dont override a method, so I would need my wrapper to be able to handle the situation where the type I need to use for this project might not implement some or all of the methods.p  pAnybody know of a suitable design pattern for this situationp

Negative 30279 pBackground I have an array of questions that are the basis for setting up a bunch of uiviews and laying them out on the screen. Each uiview has a title and an imageview. I would like to add a tap gesture recognizer to the imageview and have the uiview be the gesture delegate.p  pThe problem Cannot get the gesture to be picked up by the uiview.p  pWhat I have tried so far If I init the view in code with init with frame, instead of loading the xib through the main bundle with the viewcontroller as owner, works without modifying the gesture code. So I think the problem must lie in how and when to add the gesture recognizer. Currently im using a setup method which loads in the question name and then adds it there. Adding it in awake from nib doesnt work.p  pThis is the code in the loop that loads each uiviewp  precodeNSArray bundle  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedQnA ownerself optionsnil]  QuestionAnswer qa for id object in bundle      if [object isKindOfClass[QuestionAnswer class]]         qa  QuestionAnswer object       CGRect f  qa.frame f.origin.x  x f.origin.y  y qa.frame  f [self.view addSubview qa] [qa setup[questions objectAtIndexi ]] codepre  pAnd this is the setup method in the QuestionAnswer classp  precodevoidsetupNSString label      self.afl.text  label     UITapGestureRecognizer tgr  [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorimageTapped]     tgr.delegate  self     [self addGestureRecognizertgr]   codepre  pQuestionAnswer implements UIGestureRecognizerDelegate. I have a breakpoint at the firstline of imageTapped and it never gets there. I have also tried applying the gesture recognizer directly to the imageview to no avail.p  pThe viewcontroller is in a splitview controller, dont think that has relevance as the recognizer worked when I init the view in code. p

Negative 30279 pcodePostScriptcode books always suggest to carefully handle dictionaries. Separate user dictionaries and keep them small, close dictionary when it is no longer needed, avoid overloading global dictionary, etc.p  pHowever, I think, these instructions back to old ages where there were severe hardware limitation for memory. Closing a dictionary to free memory. The memory a PS script needs were probably comparable with the machine available memory. In modern time, the memory needed for a heavy codePostScriptcode task e.g. long document or complicated drawing is much lesser than the machine memory, and closing a dictionary with hundreds or even thousands of elements should have no significant effect on the machine performance.p  pCorrect me if Im wrong Consider that we put everything in one dictionary or global dictionary does it have a negative impact on the PostScript performancep  pDoes it still beneficial from performance point of view, not ease of coding to separate dictionary, and more importantly close them when not needed Or it just frees a tiny fraction of memoryp

However, when I do my calculations in between and then try to codefreecode the arrays, I get an access violation exception c00000005. When I was debugging it, I noticed that the program would execute perfectly every time if I had a breakpoint within the freearray loop and did every line individually. However, the compiled code wouldnt ever run past row6 of my second array on its own. I turned off all optimisations in the compiler, and I still got the error upon execution.p  h1Additional infoh1  precodetypedef struct      int    height     int    width     int    bottomposition of the bottom tubeslice boundary     unsigned int  datptra pointer to a 2d array      arrayinfo codepre  pWhere the codedatptrcode is now a proper 2D pointer.

The code causing the exception was the followingp  precodevoid fillnumberarrayinfo array,  int value,  int x1,  int y1,  int x2,  int y2fills a rectangular part of the array with value          int i, j     foriy1  ilty2ampampiltarraygtheight  istart seeding the values by row as in vertically              forjx1  iltx2ampampiltarraygtwidth  jseed the values by columns as in horizontally                  arraygtdatptr[i][j]value                codepre  pAnd codeiltx2ampampiltarraygtwidthcode wasnt being evaluated as I expected Chris Dodd, you were right. I thought that it would evaluate both conditions in that order or stop if either was FALSE, independent of their order. However, it turned out it didnt work that way and it was simply refusing to evaluate the codeiltarraygtwidthcode part correctly. Also, I assumed that it would trigger an exception upon trying to access memory outside of the array range, but it didnt. Anyway,p  pI changed the code top  precodevoid fillnumberarrayinfo array,  int value,  int x1,  int y1,                                                     int x2,  int y2      int i, j     ify1gtarraygtheight y1arraygtheight1     ify2gtarraygtheight y1arraygtheight1     ifx1gtarraygtwidth  x2arraygtwidth1     ifx2gtarraygtwidth  x2arraygtwidth1     foriy1  ilty2  istart seeding the values by row              forjx1  jltx2  jseed the values by column                  arraygtdatptr[i][j]value                codepre  pAnd now it works.

As such, Im looking into using GZIPped svg files .svgz.p  pA quick test shows that a 50k SVG we are using compresses down to 8k via Gzip. p  pThe catch, however, is that it appears that there needs to be a clientserver relationship going on to decompress the SVGZ file. I cant get Safari to render the linked .svgz file when run locally as I assume it will be when via a webview in a PhoneGap compiled app. Chrome appears to be able to render the svgz, though. p  pSo, my questionsp  ul liIs there any way to use .svgz files locally on iOS via a PhoneGap app I havent gotten to the point where were compiling via PhoneGap yet so cant test that part at this timeli liAny known issues with .svgz on Android given it seems OK on desktop Chromeli liShould I even be bothering with .svgz in this situation where there arent actual download speed concerns outside the initial app downloadli ul

The way I am attempting to solve this problem is by creating the functions as taking an array of void pointers and returning an array of void pointers, and then casting the arguments and return values as needed.p  pTo figure out how this would work, Im trying to build a simple dummy, but cant get it to compile.  Ive tried a number of things, but I keep getting different errors.  heres an examplep  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt include ltmapgt  using namespace std  void string2mapvoid args     takes a string of the form keyvaluekeyvalue... and returns a mapltstring,stringgt     string st  string args[0]     mapltstring, stringgt result  map ltstring, stringgt     code doesnt matter     return void ampvoid ampresult   int main     string test  hellotherehoware you     mapltstring, stringgt result  mapltstring, stringgtstring2mapvoid ampvoid amptest[0]      return 0  codepre  pwhen I try to compile, I getp  precodevoid.cpp In function void string2mapvoid void.cpp1234 error lvalue required as unary amp operand void.cpp In function int main void.cpp1789 error lvalue required as unary amp operand codepre  pObviously there are plenty of things wrong here, but I really just dont know where to start.  Can anyone either show me whats wrong with the code above, or give me an alternative to the way I am currently doing itp  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pThe reason I am returning a codevoidcode instead of just codevoidcode is that there might be a circumstance where I need to return multiple values of different types.  An example would be if, above, I wanted to return both the resulting map AND the number of entries in the map.  I havent even gotten to the point of figuring out how to construct that array yet, though.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo based on the responses so far, it seems pretty clear that this is the wrong way of solving this problem.  With that in mind, can anyone suggest a better one  I need to be able to store the various function in a single map, which means I need to be able to define a single data type to functions that take and return different types.  And it IS important to be able to return multiple values.p

Negative 30279 pWell, Ive tried asking on the Apple developer forums but no one responded. I thought that stackoverflow would be more appropriate. Here it is...p  pI have some OpenCL kernel that runs through pixels stored in a frame buffer object, and counts nonblack and nonwhite pixels. It used to run fine on my machine, but I believe that updates to Mac OS X andor devtools might have caused a problem to cause it stall.p  pThe kernel object associated with the kernel code is attached to a QT window, and the kernel code is run ntimes when the window requires an render update. This window is updated twice after it is created initially, which means that the sequence of openCL code does not cause problems initially. When I bring the window to the foreground, it requires another update and attempts to run the kernel code another ntimes. But in the middle of those ntimes, it stalls. i.e. if it needs to run 51 times, it stalls at iteration 26.  It appears that a call to clEnqueueReadBuffer causes a stall.p  pstrongIm going to leave out details about why I use the openCL code unless its absolutely necessary since that might confuse peoplestrong. I thought it would be good to focus on the OpenCL code itself.

Negative 30279 pIm developing a distribution for the Python package Im writing so I can post it on PyPI. Its my first time working with distutils, setuptools, distribute, pip, setup.py and all that and Im struggling a bit with a learning curve thats quite a bit steeper than I anticipated p  pI was having a little trouble getting some of my test data files to be included in the tarball by specifying them in the codedatafilescode parameter in setup.py until I came across a different post here that pointed me toward the codeMANIFEST.incode file. Just then I snapped to the notion that what you include in the tarballzip using MANIFEST.in and what gets installed in a users Python environment when they do easyinstall or whatever based on what you specify in codesetup.pycode are two very different things in general there being a lot more in the tarball than actually gets installed.p  pThis immediately triggered a codesmell for me and the realization that there must be more than one use case for a distribution I had been fixated on the only one Ive really participated in, using easyinstall or pip to install a library. And then I realized I was developing work product where I had only a partial understanding of the endusers I was developing for.p  pSo my question is this What are the use cases for a Python distribution other than installing it in ones Python environment Who else am I serving with this distribution and what do they care most aboutp  pHere are some of the working issues I havent figured out yet that bear on the answerp  ul lipIs it a sensible thing to include everything thats under source control git in the source distribution In the age of github, does anyone download a source distribution to get access to the full project source Or should I just post a link to my github repo Wont including everything bloat the distribution and make it take longer to download for folks who just want to install itpli lipIm going to host the documentation on readthedocs.org. Does it make any sense for me to include HTML versions of the docs in the source distributionpli lipDoes anyone use codepython setup.py testcode to run tests on a source distribution If so, what role are they in and what situation are they in I dont know if I should bother with making that work and if I do, who to make it work for.pli ul

Negative 30279 pWe are upgrading an ASP Classic website actually, a virtual directory under a larger website to ASP.NET 3.5. There will be some legacy directories that remain ASP Classic. Other than that, every .asp file will be replaced by an .aspx file in the same location in the directory hierarchy. We would like not to break old links coming into the site from elsewhere. The website is hosted on IIS 6 and we have no control over this.p  pMy idea was, in IIS, to replace the usual handler for .asp files, asp.dll, with aspnetisapi.dll. strongFirst questionstrong If I do that, will requests for .asp files then be routed through any custom HTTP modules I create and register in web.configp  pThen I would create an HTTP module hooked into BeginRequest that would test whether a requests path before any querystring ends in .asp. If so, it would check whether the physical file exists. If not, then Ill use HttpContext.RewritePath to append the x to the .asp. Otherwise, if the .asp file DOES exist, Ill use HttpContext.RemapHandler to switch the handler back to asp.dll so that the file will be processed as the ASP Classic file that it is.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong Will this work strongThird questionstrong What do I use as the argument to the RemapHandler method How do I acquire a reference to an instance of the ASP Classic handler If I knew the answer to the third question, Id have just tried all this on my ownp  pstrongUPDATEstrong OK, I did try it out myself, except that I renamed the remaining .asp files so that their extension is .aspc ASP Classic, and in IIS I assigned the old asp.dll as their handler. Then, instead of checking whether the .asp file requested exists and remapping to the ASP Classic handler if so, I checked instead whether a file in the corresponding physical location emexcept with the extension .aspcem exists. If so, I rewrite the URL to append the c. This worked Therefore, the answer to my first question, above, is yes, and the answer to my second question is yes, pretty much, except that the part about remapping the handler is unknown. But it would be preferable not to have to change the extensions on all my legacy .asp files, so I am left with strongone questionstrong Will the original RemapHandler approach work and, if so, what is its argumentp

Negative 30279 pWhy to use references rather than pointers when there is no compile time type checking on referencesp  pImagine that you are creating an object of type codePersoncode that needs to hold a referencepointer to their codeHousecode pretty random  so the person object would hold the house referencepointer as a data member. Imagine this was done with referencesp  precodeclass Person    public       PersonHouseamp myHouse  housemyHouse      private       Houseamp house  codepre  pThe issue I see though is if you forget to include the amp in the data member declaration that thing you thought was a reference becomes a copy. Surely it would be safer to pass and save a pointer so this error would be flagged up at compile timep  pIm not making a point to use one or the other  Im asking why are references used over pointers to save data membersp

It has a compilergenerated destructor.  Stepping through the code shows a number of calls deleting strings and other std objects, and then it appears to freeze when stepping into the next function that is, at the end of codebasicstringcode, pressing F7 at the closing brace codecode, which the IDE never shows.  The freeze is that its inside Sleep.  This code is running in the main thread.p  pI tried using the CPU view to deduce the delay Sleep was being called with, but could not spot it  I am not completely up on x86 assembly code, Im afraid.p  pOne other thread is inside codeSleepcode, probably related to COM the app is a COM server, although nothing is using COM at the moment.

While there are other threads in the program, they are all blocked waiting for something to do, this time using codeWaitForSingleObjectcode or similar.  This background task thread wakes returns from Sleep once every 100ms I dont see yet how it could affect another threads codedeletecode.p  pNo other threads are deleting or allocating anything, as far as I can tell.

Negative 30279 pI am using http post method to send request to a Http Server URL. p  pTime difference between request and response is around 60 seconds but as per Server team they are sending response withing 7 seconds once request reached at their end. p  pI dont think network is taking remaining 53 seconds of time to reach packet at server end, so what can be the issue. p  pIn this application we are using synchronous communication in between client and server. Kindly provide me following details also.p  ol liIs it due to server is sending request at more speed than server is able to handle. In this case many times client is getting request at interval of 3 seconds whereas server is taking 7 seconds to handle this.li liWhat is network buffer. Whether there are two buffers at network level one at client place and other at server place.li liIf server is unable to handle request at same speed what client is sending is all request get buffered at client buffer and what  will happen if more request are pending to be processed than maximum size of that buffer.li liWhat are alternative way to improve performance if we are at client end and no control on serverli ol  pEDIT  When I used wireshark in my network to capture network logs I found that it is appearning in wireshark 20 seconds after actually my application is send to Server. What is reason behind this delay. what can be the possible reason in which request is appearing in network 20 seconds delay from actually it has been sent.p

Negative 30279 pI am implementing a solution using OpenCL and I want to do the following thing, say for example you have a large array of data that you want to copy in the GPU once and have many kernels process batches of it and store the results in their specific output buffers.p  pThe actual question is here which way is faster Enqueue each kernel with the portion of the array it needs to have or pass out the whole array before hand an let each kernel in the same context process the required batch, since they would have the same address space and could each map the array concurrently. Of course the said array is readonly but is not constant as it changes every time I execute the kernels... so I could cache it using a global memory buffer.p  pAlso if the second way is actually faster could you point me with direction on how this could be implemented, as I havent found anything concrete yet although I am still searching .p  pCheers.p

Negative 30279 pI have a file transfer service written using WCF. It recieves a file sent by the client. The client inturn sends across the file using FileStream  MessageContract. I have made the WCF file transfer service as singleton using the following attributesp  precode[ServiceBehaviorInstanceContextMode  InstanceContextMode.Single,  ConcurrencyMode  ConcurrencyMode.Multiple] codepre  pI try to use multiple threads in the client itself.  Each thread creates an instance of channelfactory  proxy.CreateChannel and sends across one distinct file to the service. I do not have any locks on the service side which allows only one file to be transferred at a time, nor on the client side. The code is kind of pass through code with no state persistance.p  pThe problem I am facing is, as such I do not see multiple threads trying to send multiple files. Each time I try to transfer multiple files using multiple threads, the service kind of does not accept multiple files at the same instance. This results in the file getting transferred sequentially instead of in parallel. I feel from the client side the file is sent but at service side its kind of just gets held up.p  pI tried using ServiceThrottling attributes, but still I do not find any difference. Is there something wrong which I am doing or is this kind of approach not validp  pOne client can only send one file across one channel Can many threads NOT send many files to the same service  Can someone please help me.p  pthanks Sandeepp

Negative 30279 pI am writing a small utility that reports system capabilities.

I am currently dynamically loading DX9, so on those systems the check gracefully fails which is ok. But I am seeking a similar solution something that will still run on emallem systems, and work correctly detect the SM version on emmostem systems.p  hr  pstrongEdit  purposestrong I am not using this code to dynamically change features of a program, ie select shaders.

For example how many customers have SM4 or above How many are using a 64bit OS Etc.  This is why either a gracefully failing, so we know it failed, or b getting an emaccurateem shader model number are the two preferred modes.p  pstrongEdit  answers so farstrong The answer below by SigTerm suggests instantiating DirectX 11, 10.1, 10, and 9.0c in order, and basing the reported shader model on which version instantiated without failures shader model 5, 4.1, 4, and DXCAPS in that order.  If possible, Id appreciate a code example of the DX11 and 10 ways to do this.p  pThis may not be a reliable solution. For example, I am running Windows on a VMWare Fusion virtual machine on OSX. The Fusion drivers report DX11 in DxDiag, yet I know from the Fusion tech specs that it a hrefhttpwww.vmware.comproductsfusionfeatures.html relnofollowonly supports DX9.0c and shader model 3a. Still, with this exception, this method seems the best way so far.p

Negative 30279 pIm having kind of a bizzare issue related to installing Symfony2 from within a vagrant environment. The environment is set up correctly and is running a web server that is serving files from a folder that is shared with the vagrant environment that is located in the base directory of vagrant. p  pBasically, vagrant is initiated in directory foo and then within foo, there is a directory called webroot. Vagrant automagically shares the foo directory. An apache server is set up to run so that webroot is the base http directory. This all works fine and I am able to serve basic HTML, PHP and the MySQL connection is tested to be fine.p  pI used composer to install vagrant the recommended way, into directory inside webroot called Symfony. All of the files now exist within the correct directory. The configuration is correct  and there are no items that Symfony claims need to be changed in config.php. p  pThe issue comes when I attempt to load appdev.php. It throws an exception claiming that it cannot create a file named cache in the app directory. p  pAs chmod a is not supported within the vagrant box I am using, I elected to set permissions by uncommenting umask0000 in appdev. Assuming it was a permission problem, I tried using chmod to adjust the permissions both within the vagrant environment and within osx to 777 for everything. p  pWhats strange is that when I chmod a file or directory inside the vagrant environment, it claims to set 777 correctly but then when I ls l, the permissions have not changed. However, when I chmod a file or directory from OUTSIDE The vagrant environment within the webroot folder, the permissions persist. As symfony does not have rw permissions within the environment, it cannot create the necessary cache and log files. When i run symfony from the command from osx, everything works fine. p  pDoes anyone have any insight as to how to change the permissions for the webroot directory so shit within the vagrant environment can actually read and write to it as chmod doesnt appear to workp  pThanksp

Negative 30279 pI need some help with my SQL logic, and Ive been working and researching this for 2 days now with zero success.p  pMy goal is to try an pass a variable from an ASP page to a stored procedure, which is utilizing the variable as criteria for a column name in the where clause.p  pSo for example a simplified version of my queryp  precodestrDept nvarchar10, strUser nvarchar30  The asp page will pass f18 to strDept amp Ted Lee to strUser  f18 is the column name in my database that I need in the where.  select x, y, z from table1 where strDept in strUser  and this is the select statement, notice the where clause. codepre  pThe stored procedure does execute, but it returns no values and I know its treating the strDept as a literal nvarchar and not a column name. p  pSo I guess my question is, how do I get SQL Server 2005 to treat my sqlDept variable as a column name p

Negative 30279 pI am relatively new to Java and am having trouble coming up with a truly object oriented design for a program I am working on. Here is a background to the program. The program is a gui based computer telephony application that monitors a phone and acts as a callerID among other things. My current design is as follows. I have created the following classes.p  pMainWindowthis is the main window of the guip  pPhonethis models the actual devicep  pPopUpWindowthis models the pop up window that pops up on an event in the Phone classp  pPhoneMessengerthis sends a message to another device when an event happens in the phone classp  pThe part I am having trouble with is that when an event happens in the Phone class I want it to update a value in the MainWindow class. I have the program working by constructing a static class variable MainWindow window in the MainWindow class and using static methods to change the values of the MainWindow class upon events in the Phone class. It works fine but I dont think this follows object oriented design principles as the Phone class now has access to all of the internal values of the MainWindow class. If someone could help me out with the design that would be amazing. p

Negative 30279 pSeveral years ago I took an algorithms course where we were giving the following problem or one like itp  blockquote   pThere is a building of codencode floors with an elevator that can only go up 2 floors at a time and down 3 floors at a time. Using dynamic programming write a function that will compute the number of steps it takes the elevator to get from floor codeicode to floor codejcode.p blockquote  pThis is obviously easy using a stateful approach, you create an array n elements long and fill it up with the values. You could even use a technically nonstateful approach that involves accumulating a result as recursively passing it around. My question is how to do this in a nonstateful manner by using lazy evaluation and tying the knot.p  hr  pI think Ive devised the correct mathematical formulap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comB2HDx.png altfi,j  0 when i is equal to j and fi,j  1  min of fi2,j and fi3,jp  pwhere codei2code and codei3code are within the allowed values.p  pUnfortunately I cant get it to terminate. If I put the codei2code case first and then choose an even floor I can get it to evaluate the even floors below the target level but thats it. I suspect that it shoots straight to the highest even floor for everything else, drops 3 levels, then repeats, forever oscillating between the top few floors.p  pSo its probably exploring the infinite space or finite but with loops in a depth first manner. I cant think of how to explore the space in a breadth first fashion without using a whole lot of data structures in between that effectively mimic a stateful approach.p  hr  pAlthough this simple problem is disappointingly difficult I suspect that having seen a solution in 1 dimension I might be able to make it work for a 2 dimensional variation of the problem.p  hr  pEDIT A lot of the answers tried to solve the problem in a different way. The problem itself isnt interesting to me, the question is about the method used. Chaosmatters approach of creating a codeminimalcode function which can compare potentially infinite numbers is possibly a step in the right direction. Unfortunately if I try to create a list representing a building with 100 floors the result takes too long to compute, since the solutions to sub problems are not reused.p  pI made an attempt to use a selfreferencing data structure but it doesnt terminate, there is some kind of infinite loop going on. Ill post my code so you can understand what it is Im going for. Ill change the accepted answer if someone can actually solve the problem using dynamic programming on a selfreferential data structure using laziness to avoid computing things more than once.p  precodelevels  go [0..10]   where     go []  []     go xxs  minimum       [ if i  7           then 0           else 1  levels  i          i lt filter n gt n gt 0 ampamp n lt 10 [x2,x3] ]        go xs codepre  pYou can see how code1  levels  icode tries to reference the previously calculated result and how codefilter n gt n gt 0 ampamp n lt 10 [x2,x3]code tries to limit the values of codeicode to valid ones. As I said, this doesnt actually work, it simply demonstrates the strongmethodstrong by which I want to see this problem solved. Other ways of solving it are strongnotstrong interesting to me.p
Negative 30279 pIve inherited maintenance of an application that, when it runs, occasionally causes the UAC admin elevation Doyouwishtoallowthis dialog to appear. To me, the obvious first thing to try is switch on UAC logging, rerun the application to make the dialog appear, then find the entry in the log that says, for example, 20131123191003 [MyApplication] attempted to write registry entry [MyRegistryKey]. Requires admin authorization, then take steps to resolve things so the dialog doesnt surface when the application is being used.p  pHowever, some people posted questions about UAC logging in 200809, in relation to Vista, and the answer was something like UAC doesnt log, but that would be a great feature for a future release. Was UAC logging ever implemented, either in Windows 7 or as a patch release If not, is there an alternative technique that is commonly used     p

Negative 30279 pIm running into a strange problem with a feature in my Rails 4  Devise 3.2 application which allows users to change their password via an AJAX POST to the following action, derived from the Devise wiki a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowTo3aAllowuserstoedittheirpassword relnofollowAllow users to edit their passworda. strongIt seems that after the user changes their password and after one or more requests later, they are forcible logged out, and will continue to get forced logged out after signing back in.strongp  precode POST updatemypassword def updatemypassword   user  User.findcurrentuser.id   authorize update, user  CanCan check here as well    if user.validpasswordparams[oldpassword]     user.password  params[newpassword]     user.passwordconfirmation  params[newpasswordconf]     if user.save       signin user, bypass gt true       head nocontent       return     end   else     render json gt  errorcode gt Incorrect password , status gt 401          return   end    render json gt  errors gt user.errors , status gt 422 end codepre  pThis action actually works fine in development, but it fails in production when Im running multithreaded, multiworker Puma instances. What is appearing to happen is that the user will remain logged in until one of their requests hits a different thread, and then they are logged out as codeUnauthorizedcode with a 401 response status. The problem does not occur if I run Puma with a single thread and a single worker. The only way I can seem to allow the user the ability to stay logged in again with multiple threads is to restart the server which is not a solution. This is rather strange, because I thought the session storage configuration I have would have handled it correctly. My codeconfiginitializerssessionstore.rbcode file contains the followingp  pcodeMyAppApplication.config.sessionstoreActionDispatchSessionCacheStore,                                 expireafter gt 3.dayscodep  pMy codeproduction.rbcode config containsp  precodeconfig.cachestore  dallistore, ENV[MEMCACHESERVERS],     poolsize gt ENV[MEMCACHEPOOLSIZE]  1,   compress gt true,   sockettimeout gt 0.75,    socketmaxfailures gt 3,    socketfailuredelay gt 0.1,   downretrydelay gt 2.seconds,   keepalive gt true,   failover gt true  codepre  pI am booting up puma via codebundle exec puma p PORT C .configpuma.rbcode.

Negative 30279 pAm quite new to wavelet analysis as well as stackoverflow and would wold like some help. I am performing a spatiotemporal analysis of rainfall data.  With PCA, I can reduce the dimension of the rainfall data into a few leading modes, yielding EOFs which explain spatial variability and principal components explaining temporal variability.p  pI would like to perform a similar analysis with wavelets using Matlab Wavelet Toolbox. As of now, I am able to decompose a 2D data spatial decomposition  but unable to take into account the temporal variability in the data.p  pMy first course of action has been to first compress the data with PCA and then perform wavelet decomposition of the leading modes in both the  spatial EOFs and temporal PCs domain. p  pI am wondering if this is the right way to perform such an analysis and would like suggestions as to how to proceed.p  pThanks alot.p

Negative 30279 pIs there a way to manipulate the field of view of camera when the camera is at 2 different positions in world spacep  pFor example, In the first position, multiple mesh parts are transformed in different directions across the originwhere the camera looks at until they form one mesh. This is done by calling glmtranslate, glmrotate, e.t.c before loading the vertices in the vbo. p  pIn the second position, I want to transform the whole mesh from above. Since I already loaded everything needed into the vbo and my models are drawn, I cant draw my new transformed mesh. Is there a way to draw my new transformed mesh without loading vertices into the vbo againp  pAnd, if I have to load my vbo again, how do I go about it, since loading the vbo is dependent on how many parts the mesh is divided into. p

Negative 30279 pSo Im working on a problem that was given to me as an interview question. Im not quite fully there, and could use some guidance as to how to approach this algorithm. The gist of it is this you have words of the same length that contain the same letters i.e., read and dear. The requested program would allow you to input any word you desire e.g, deinstitutionalization and get the location of that word within the context of all the other letters sorted alphanumerically, without having created an entire list of possibilities. So, for example, deinstitutionalization may be in position 156363363 of the possible words that d, e, i, n ,s, t, u, o, a, l, and z make up with a length of 22 characters.p  pIve seen a lot of different paradigms used for generating the permutations of a string, but I havent been able to put any of them together to solve this problem. Is there a specific algorithm that would be at least somewhat suitable for this Are there any suggestions on how to approach this Id like to figure this out on my own, but just need a bit of a bump to get there.p

Negative 30279 pIm using SQL Server 2012.  p  pI want to query data from a specific SQL column that meets certain criteria.  This column contains free form text entered by a user.  The user can enter whatever heshe wants, but always includes a URL which may be entered anywhere within the free form text.  p  pEach URL is similar and contains consistent elements, such as the domain, but also references a unique article ID number within the URL.  Think of these numbers as referencing knowledge base articles.  p  pThe article ID is a different number depending on the article used and new articles are regularly created.  p  pI need a query identifying all of these article ID numbers within the URLs.  The only means Ive developed so far is to use SUBSTRING to count characters until reaching the article ID number.  This is unreliable since users dont always include the URL at the beginning.  It would be better if I could tell SUBSTRING to count from the beginning of the URL regardless of where it resides within the text.  p  pFor example, it begins counting whenever it finds HTTP or a common keyword each URL contains.  Another option would be if I could extract the URL into its own table.  Ive yet to figure out how to execute either of these ideas inside SQL.  p  pThe following is what I have so far.p  precodeselect      scl.number,      ol.accountnum,      scl.opendate as CallOpenDate,      sce.opendate as NoteEntryDate,      sce.notes,      substringsce.notes, 102, 4 as ArticleID,      sclcc.pmsoft,      ol.territorydesc  from select  from supportcallevent as sce     where sce.opendate gt 20140401 000000.000 as sce  inner join supportcalllist as scl on scl.SupportCallIDsce.supportcallid inner join organizationlist as ol on ol.partyidscl.partyid inner join supportcalllistcustcare as sclcc on sclcc.supportcallidscl.supportcallid  where sce.notes like httpaskus.how  order by ol.territorydesc, scl.number codepre

The problem lays in the way i parse the data from the server. Currently i parse them in my collection as followsp  precodeparse function response      return response.entries  codepre  pSo when i  request a collection from the server, my parse function works fine. But when i request only the single model from the server as in the case of creating a new model or altering an existing one it still tries to parse an array, which obviously fails and as a result doest not assing an id to the model. I tried to add parse function also to my modelp  precodeparse function response return response.entry  codepre  pWhich makes everything working on a single model it properly assigns ids to them but now, when i request a whole collection, my collection parse function doesnt work and i cant view it. brp  pSo now it seems, i have to choose between getting a single model or the whole collection viewed correctly, I cant have both. Do you have any solutionsp

Negative 30279 pI am using XAMPP as server in ubuntu 14.04 VPS of digitalocean. I tried to setup virtual hosts. But it is not working and I am getting 403 error of access denied.p  pI changed files too. My files with changes arep  poptlamppetchttpd.confp  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocstrunkgt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocstrunkmoddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to www will be interpreted by the  server as wwwlogaccesslog, where as logaccesslog will be  interpreted as logaccesslog.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot optlampp     Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults    Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultlogs    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.  It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for  running httpd, as with most system services.  User root Group www ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin youexample.com    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName www.example.comPort  XAMPP ServerName localhost    Deny access to the entirety of your servers filesystem. You must  explicitly permit access to web content directories in other  ltDirectorygt blocks below.  ltDirectory gt     AllowOverride none     Require all denied ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.      DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot optlampphtdocs ltDirectory optlampphtdocsgt           Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,      or any combination of        Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews           Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All      doesnt give it to you.           The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see      httphttpd.apache.orgdocstrunkmodcore.htmloptions      for more information.          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks      XAMPP     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI Includes            AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.      It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords        Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit          AllowOverride None      since XAMPP 1.4     AllowOverride All            Controls who can get stuff from this server.          Require all granted ltDirectorygt    DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory  is requested.  ltIfModule dirmodulegt     DirectoryIndex index.html      XAMPP     DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var index.php index.php3 index.php4 ltIfModulegt    The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being   viewed by Web clients.   ltFiles .htgt     Require all denied ltFilesgt    ErrorLog The location of the error log file.  If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog logserrorlog    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn  ltIfModule logconfigmodulegt           The following directives define some format nicknames for use with      a CustomLog directive see below.          LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined     LogFormat h l u t r gts b common      ltIfModule logiomodulegt        You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O       LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio     ltIfModulegt            The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.      If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.          CustomLog logsaccesslog common            If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog logsaccesslog combined ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAlias cgibin optlamppcgibin  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule cgidmodulegt           ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX      socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.

TypesConfig etcmime.types            AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi      XAMPP, since LAMPP 0.9.8     AddHandler cgiscript .cgi .pl       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.           XAMPP     AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile  directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.  MIMEMagicFile etcmagic    Customizable error responses come in three flavors  1 plain text 2 local redirects 3 external redirects   Some examples ErrorDocument 500 The server made a boo boo.

Default setting is to accept 200 Ranges. MaxRanges unlimited    EnableMMAP and EnableSendfile On systems that support it,   memorymapping or the sendfile syscall may be used to deliver  files.  This usually improves server performance, but must  be turned off when serving from networkedmounted   filesystems or if support for these functions is otherwise  broken on your system.

Negative 30279 pRecently Ive been taking a look at the behavior of my code when tuning my thread pool. I noticed that the virtual memory peak usage grows with every new thread I add to the thread pool, in a way not related to the thread text size or anything else.p  pI created a simple test program which printed out the VmPeak value  by parsing the contents of procselfstatus  for the process after every new thread is created, and noticed how it would follow a certain pattern  VmPeak  OriginalVmPeak  numberOfThreads , until it saturates once a certain level is reached.p  pI know a thing or two about operating systems and virtual memory, and I know that the virtual memory refers to anything addressable from the point of view of the process  including libraries and so on , but why is there a correlation with the thread number, if they share the same addressing space And why does it saturate after a certain number of threads is reachedp

Negative 30279 pBackground I was trying to roll my own observable collection, by implementing IEnumerable, INotifyPropertyChanged and INotifyCollectionChanged. It works fine, but when I databind the CollectionChanged event is always null. The databound property does however updated, since I am sending a Items[] property changed event.  So this got me wondering what the point of INotifyCollectionChanged is in terms of databinding, since in my class it never gets triggered, but the databinding still works it updates all the bindings to the collection.p  pI then decided to do some more digging, and decompiled ObservableCollection. When I databind to an ObservableCollection the CollectionChanged event isnt null like in my implementation.p  pSo really I am wondering why ObservableCollection gets special treatment, and what role INotifyCollectionChange plays in databinding if anyp

Negative 30279 pI am trying to setup a POC for myself using Nginx, Node.js and Socket.io 1.0 using clustering on Rackspace.  I am under the assumption that I need to use clustering because I want this to be scalable across multiple servers if needed. I want each node to have their own instance and as of now I cant see any need for each of the instances to have to talk to each other for any reason.  Again as of now, I believe I need to use clustering for simply the fact that I may have many clients connecting to this server and I want it to be able to grown and shrink accordingly. My end goal is to build a little POC similar to what is shown here a hrefhttpscloud.google.comdevelopersarticlesrealtimegamingwithnodejswebsocketongcp relnofollowhttpscloud.google.comdevelopersarticlesrealtimegamingwithnodejswebsocketongcpap  pI just got what I believe to be a valid setup of the new Socket.io 1.0 established, but when connecting from different devices behind my router, they are all showing the same PID in my logging and I assume this is due to the required stickysessioning by Socket.io.  I am not sure if this is the same as the workerprocess that we used to get with clustering, but again I am still trying to get my head wrapped around all this.p  pFirst I want to know if using clustering and stickysessions is required, since only 1 PID is issued for the same external IP, is there anyway to have each computer treated as its own instance  I do not want to send back a response that updates everyone behind that IP.p  pMy second question is this and it may be a stupid question but im asking anyway  In reading about how to get the stickysessions working I kept seeing people stating to use stickysessions, like by IP Address.  The word like is what got me.  I seemed to have found people referring to using stickysessions with IP and cookies. Can you do it by anything else, such as a username, issued token or anything My concern is if someone is playing with this on a mobile device and they switch towers, the tower will issue a new IP so inturn a new PID would get issued and essentially that players game lost.  Am I understanding this rightp  pPlease forgive me as I am new to Node.js but thought this would be a cool way to learn node.js and clustering in the cloud.  Any info or direction that anyone can provide would be of great help.  Many of the tuts all seem to broadcast events to everyone but i am looking for a scalable solution where each connection can be sent events individually most fo the time. I also need to solve for a number of people behind the same firewall being treated as separate connections when the server communicates to them.

Negative 30279 pSearched hard for a piece of code which does what i want and i am happy with.

It is fine if the consumer is notified more than the reoccurring period but it should not be notified less frequent.p  pIt is possible that multiple notifications for new data occur while the consumer is already notified and working. So codeSemaphoreSlimcode was not a good fit.

Negative 30279 pIm working on a Magento marketplace where the client would like to use paypal delayed chain as payment method. Here Client will hold the vendors payment for 15 days and then execute payments. The scenario is Client dont want to hold payments for highly credible vendors. He wants to pay them right away. But in delayed chain, we cant execute payments based on vendors.  When the time comes to pay vendors, all vendors will be paid at once based on transaction id or paykey which used to create payment. p  pI need to implement this scenario in Magento.

But all documentation I could find was for the aforementioned emforeachem . If you could direct me to a solution it would be very nice.p  pPlease remember that Im a newbie. I swear Ive read a lot on this but havent found a number of solutions I can apply to this.p  pThank you in advance, Tonio.p

Negative 30279 pIm dealing with a circular dependency w.r.t. a Windows service and its dependence upon a driver. The situation is as followsp  pI wrote a Windows service in C. This service depends on a DLL which installs a driver the first time it is loadedused the DLL uses the driver during operation thenceforth.p  pIn early testing I would install the service via a commandline call to the service executable with the codeINSTALLcode flag  this would call codeInstallServicecode internally.p  pThen I ran into an issue the service would run when I started it manually, but when it was set to run automatically after boot it would start before the driver had been loaded and it would error because of this.p  pTo fix this, I set up a dependency for the service upon the driver  Windows treats drivers similar to services  in the services registry entry  codeHKLMSystemCurrentControlSetServicesltSERVICEgtcode in the codeDependOnServicecode value. This fixed that issue.p  pFastforward to deployment I am using WiX to install and start the service. During installation, I want to set the driver up as a dependency of my service. However, if I define the driver as a dependency in the codeServiceInstallcode element then WiX tries to start it before starting my service, thus my problem WiX cant start the service without starting the dependency, and the dependency isnt there because the service hasnt run yet.p  pIf I dont specify the dependency in the installer configuration file then the service installs and runs fine.p  pI figured that I could define the dependency after installing the service, in the registry like before, but theres no entry for the service therep  pAnother thing the service runs after boot now Without having defined the dependency I havent done much testing to see if this is consistent or not.p  pSo, how does WiX tell Windows that theres a service, i.e. why is there no registry entry How can I specify the dependency Do I even emneedem to specify one anymore Should I forego using the WiX servicerelated elements and run the commands I did during testing manually in the installerp  pIve been wrestling with this and researching for at least a week any insight would be appreciated.p  hr  pstrongEnvironment Infostrongp  ul liDevelopment Windows 7, 32bitli liVisual Studio 2010li liWiX v3.8li liDeployment Windows 7, 32bit and 64bit  strongemCUSTOM, STRIPPEDDOWN IMAGESemstrong so something standard might not be presentli ul

Negative 30279 pOk, Im writing a pyqt software to generate a webpage. Due to some security issues with Chrome and other things, I need a webserver to test the webpage.p  pSo I thought to create a button called run, that you can click or press f5 to start a server, and open the browser to the page. The snippet of code that this button calls, simplified there is some code to do things, including changing current directory and such, looks like thisp  precodeimport sys  import webbrowser from SimpleHTTPServer import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler as HandlerClass from BaseHTTPServer import HTTPServer as ServerClass  Protocol  HTTP1.0 port  8080 ip  127.0.0.1  new  2 goes to new tab url  httpip0.formatport  serverAddress  ip,port HandlerClass.protocol  Protocol httpd  ServerClassserverAddress, HandlerClass  sa  httpd.socket.getsockname webbrowser.openurl,newnew httpd.serveforever codepre  pOk, the problem is as serveforever is called, it can be expected to serve forever. Is there a way to kill the server after browser is closed p  pEdit I understand many people recommend using threads but I cant find a way to detect that the browser has closed or killing the thread in system monitor Im on Ubuntu while testing. p  pEdit2 ok, Ive read webbrowser.py, it doesnt seem to return any sort of process identifier... p  pEdit3 Im reflecting on this, maybe the correct approach would be checking if someone is accessing the server, and if not, then kill it... This way I can detect if the tab was closed... Problem is the only way I can think uses a dummy page with this power that loads whatever page to test inside, which seems too hackish...p  pIt seems if I can find a way of doing this, maybe through error responses...I can do a webserver in a subprocess that has a while and exits by itself like the one here a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarybasehttpserver.htmlmoreexamples relnofollowhttpsdocs.python.org2librarybasehttpserver.htmlmoreexamplesap  precodeimport sys  from threading import Thread import webbrowser import BaseHTTPServer  import SimpleHTTPServer  serverClassBaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer handlerClassSimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler  Protocol  HTTP1.0 port  8080 ip  127.0.0.1  new  2 2 goes to new tab, 0 same and 1 window. url  httpip0.formatport  handlerClass.protocol  Protocol httpd  serverClassip,port, handlerClass  sa  httpd.socket.getsockname printnnServing HTTP on 0, port 1nn.formatsa[0],sa[1]  browserOk  webbrowser.openurl,newnew  def runWhileTrue     while True         printvarshttpd         httpd.handlerequest  runWhileTrue codepre  pRight now Im thinking about using a timer like a watchdog, if the server is not used more then a period, it gets killed...

Negative 30279 pThis has stumped me for days, and Ive been unable to find any online resource about this problem.  Our site has an error that only presents itself after javascript has been minified.  When debugging locally with the minified code, I see that there is an extra request presumably AJAX to our page that does not occur when the code is not minified.br strongEDITstrong  I have found a solution and a culprit, but dont understand why its a problem.  This is a node.js issue relating to where a referenced file is stored in source.  See the second edit below.  Im still trying to find any ideas about how an extra AJAX request can be made only after minification, and when the problem is identified I may need help correcting it.p  pHere is where the problem presents itselfp  precodepublic class PopulateGlobalSettingsAttribute  System.Web.Mvc.ActionFilterAttribute    public override void OnActionExecutingActionExecutingContext filterContext        var request  filterContext.HttpContext.Request     var result  filterContext.Result     var baseController  filterContext.Controller as BaseController      if request.IsAjaxRequest       ampamp request.HttpMethod.Equalsget, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase       ampamp request.IsAuthenticated       ampamp result is PartialViewResult       ampamp result is JsonResult       ampamp baseController  null            ...      codepre  pWhen javascript is not minified, we get one request to this code block for the page being loaded Its important to note this is an Index page, all conditions are met, and it enters the block and does what it needs to do.p  pWhen javascript is minified, we get two requests to this block  the first one enters with all conditions being met and behaves as expected.  The page then loads, and all elements appear to load correctly in the browser.  Then, a second request to the same URL hits this block.  In this second instance, request.IsAjaxRequest is true, it skips over the block, and then we see the exception Cannot perform runtime binding on a null reference on the view, on something that is already visibly fully loaded.  This happens because the view is referencing a permission attribute that this code block is supposed to attach to the request.  Adding a check for null here makes the error go away, but I view this as treating the symptom without addressing the underlying problem.p  pBecause the javascript is minified, I dont know where this extra request is coming from.  The call stack just shows external code going through System libraries.  Ive tried doing a Find All on the URL, but there isnt anything in our javascript thats obviously making a direct call.p  pIm at the point of rolling back code to try and find the last time this worked without issue, but since this can be time consuming, Im hoping someone could give me some troubleshooting tips for this kind of issue.  p  pPlease let me know if I need to include more information  I understand its difficult to know whats going on here, but since the problem is resulting from minified code I cant easily determine where the real problem lies that is in fact why Im reaching out for help.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ive found the culprit, but can provide no explanation as to why this is a problem.  It has something to do with node.js require  a new reference was added to one of our global javascript files, and for some reason, the folder that file resides in actually matters.p  pHeres the change that broke our code file names including our company name obscuredp  precoderequire[   jquery,   customWeb,   corenotificationsnotifications,   corepluginsjquery.customEllipsis,   sharedjavaScriptExtensions ], codepre  pHeres the fixp  precoderequire[   jquery,   customWeb,   corenotificationsnotifications,   corepluginsjquery.customEllipsis,   corejavaScriptExtensions ], codepre  pMoving this new file into our core folder stops the extra AJAX request, for some reason.p  pLikewise, replacing the shared reference with a reference to any other file in the shared folder reproduces the problem.  Replacing or commenting the code in the new javaScriptExtensions.js file has no effect  it is simply the fact that weve started including a file from the shared folder.p  pI have updated the question  now that a solution has been found, could anyone explain emwhyem this is a solution  My best guess is it has something to do with the order in which node.js loads required files, and for some reason when the javascript is minified something gets misplaced or overwritten.p

Negative 30279 pI have a user control with export to excel linkbutton placed in pager template of grid view. I call that user control in the parent.aspx page, and that usercontrol is wrapped under update panel in the parent.aspx page with all possible properties set like childrenastriggers, update mode etc. p  pProcess  Generally, As in normal post back scenario without update panel, when the export to excel linkbutton is clicked, the control is transferred from user control to another aspx page say generateExcel.aspx using server.transfergenerateExcel.aspxactionexcel, there the actual export to excel code gets executed and response.write, response.end, response.flush and all are used to write the content to excel sheet successfully.p  pNote  As I am using server.transfer in user control page, the control remains in the parent.aspx page itself even after excel generation.p  pProblem When the same process is followed using update panel. This gives the jsscriptparse exception. According to some articles, response.write intervenes before the rendering stage of update panel, thus alters the output in non recognizable format to browser.p  pCan anybody please suggest me how to first of all find the linkbutton id present in the usercontrol and register the postbacktrigger to that linkbutton in the update panel,albeit in page load of parent.aspx page.p  pAs the update panel is in parent.aspx page and user control is embedded in parent.aspx page, I am unable to find a way to add a trigger to linkbutton in parent.aspx page.p

Negative 30279 pI have a scenario where multiple threads are sending data over a single socket. A unique ID has been inserted into the message and the unique ID is echoed back in the response message. Everything works great when the socket is isolated to a single client as expected. Now Im looking for an async  await pattern for multiple threads where the client waits for a specific response.p  pSome code to demonstratep  precodeusing var ns  new NetworkStreamsocket      byte[] requestBuffer  GetBufferrequest     await ns.WriteAsyncrequestBuffer, 0, request.Length     byte[] responseBuffer  await ReceiveMessageAsyncns       process response message  codepre  pThe above example does not work in a multithreaded scenario because messages can come back in any order, so the next message off the wire may not belong to the current client. My thought was that the client would register a delegate or Task using its unique ID storing that in a Dictionary and when a message came back with that unique ID, the delegate or task would be completed with the response bytes. Im guessing this would be fairly easy to implement with an EventHandler but Im looking for a way to await the response.p  pFor examplep  precodeusing var ns  new CustomNetworkStreamsocket      Task waitTask  ns.RegisterTaskthis.UniqueId      byte[] requestBuffer  GetBufferrequest     await ns.WriteAsyncrequestBuffer, 0, request.Length      byte[] responseBuffer  await waitTask       process response message  codepre  pI dont know what the RegisterTask method would look like, how to store the task, how to make the task wait and later complete it with Task as the Result.p  pAny ideas  Ive researched Toubs Async Coordination Primitives series but Im not certain if thats the right approach or not.    p

Negative 30279 pI am trying to use Boost.Chrono to measure CPU time of my code. My C code for this is given below. The problem is that I sometimes get negative durations as output. This happens when I use processrealcpuclock. When I use steadyclock the problem does not appear. Some of the outputs I  took are followingp  blockquote   ptime for 1st implemention360 msp      ptime for 2nd implementation3284.97 msp      hr      ptime for 1st implemention360 msp      ptime for 2nd implementation1010 msp      hr      ptime for 1st implemention3924.97 msp      ptime for 2nd implementation1010 msp blockquote  pOnly the second one is as expected. I guess the problem was about overflow of the duration, but in the third output, time for 1st implementation should be around 13 of the time for 2nd implemenation, then there should not be overflow if I can see time for 2nd implemenation.

Negative 30279 pI was looking into using boolean logic with my bean validation using Hibernate Validator in scenarios where ANDing the constraints does not suffice. I found that it is possible to change this default behavior by creating a new annotation with the codeConstraintCompositioncode annotation as a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatevalidator5.1referenceenUShtmlsinglesectionbooleanconstraintcomposition relnofollowdescribed in the documentationa. The documentation provides the following example.p  precodeConstraintCompositionOR Patternregexp  [az] Sizemin  2, max  3 ReportAsSingleViolation Target METHOD, FIELD  RetentionRUNTIME ConstraintvalidatedBy    public interface PatternOrSize      String message default org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter11.              booleancomposition.PatternOrSize.message      Classltgt[] groups default        Classlt extends Payloadgt[] payload default    codepre  pUsing this codePatternOrSizecode validation constraint means that the input string is emeitherem lowercased emorem has a size between 2 and 3. Now this raises a couple of questionsp  ul liI embelieveem one has to create a new annotation to change the default boolean logic behavior. Is this correct If one could define the boolean logic at a class field, that would be really nice, but it may not be possibleli liIs it possible to further customize the boolean logic behavior without creating a custom validator, e.g. defining codeANDcode and codeORcode at the same time I could not find anything that suggests that this is possible, but maybe I missed something.li listrongAnd most importantlystrong is it possible to make the arguments to the codePatterncode and codeSizecode constraints dynamic Because otherwise I guess I would have to define a new annotation for every combination of arguments that I need. Defining a new annotation simply to change the arguments to codeSizecode does not seem feasible, but may be necessaryli ul  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 30279 pI have created a gameboard 5x5 and I now want to decide when a move is legal as fast as possible. For example a piece at 0,0 wants to go to 1,1, is that legal First I tried to find this out with computations but that seemed bothersome. I would like to hardcode the possible moves based on a position on the board and then iterate through all the possible moves to see if they match the destinations of the piece. I have problems getting this on paper. This is what I would likep  precodegame piece is at 0,0 now, decide if 1,1 is legal Point destination  new Point1,1      destination.findInlegalMoves[0][0] codepre  pThe first problem I face is that I dont know how to put a list of possible moves in an array at for example index [0][0]. This must be fairly obvious but I am stuck at this for some time. I would like to create an array in which there is a list of Point objects. So in semicode codelegalMoves[0][0]  Point1,1,Point0,1,Point1,0code I am not sure if this is efficient but it makes logically move sense than maybe [[1,1],[0,1],[1,0]] but I am not sold on this.p  pThe second problem I have is that instead of creating the object at every start of the game with an instance variable legalMoves, I would rather have it read from disk. I think that it should be quicker this way Is the serializable class the way to gop  pMy 3rd small problem is that for the 25 positions the legal moves are unbalanced. Some have 8 possible legal moves, others have 3. Maybe this is not a problem at all.p

Negative 30279 pIve added some custom CSS code to a Wordpress.com theme to alter link formatting. Im a beginner, but I attempted to research this and found some code that looked reasonable. p  pChrome is getting it about 90 right and FF about 10 right. Is this inevitable and I should revert to theme defaults, or is there something I can do differently to make this change work in common browsers p  pTo be more specific, border none is working in both browsers, but the custom color for the link is usually missing in FFwhich means no one but me can tell its a link. Even in Chrome its only usually the right color. And, the color I set for active isnt displaying at all. Meanwhile, the block quote change is rendering in both browsers. p  pAll I added was this CSS added in the edit window they provide which by definition means its at the end of the total CSS for the page, so that should make it override or inherit, I thought.p  precodediv.entrycontent alink      color 2C60BA     textdecoration none     border none   div.entrycontent aactive      color 3A93BC     textdecoration none     border none   blockquote      float none     width 24em     marginleft 2em  codepre  pThanks for any comments.p
Negative 30279 pI am using parse as database and I have a table called Address, a user can have multiple addresses. I have an activity which displays a list of address which are tagged to a user. The user can delete edit or add the addresses. Once a user deletes an address there is an option to undo the deletion. So I am using the same address object which I deleted from parse to save again. But the address class is a subclass of ParseObject and it still holds the value of getObjectId. So when I try to save that address object in background because of the Object Id value it tries to find that particular row in the address table and update it which actually doesnt exists. The error I get is ParseException object not found for update. The code as followsp  p deletion codep  precodemAddress  mAddressAdapter.getItemposition mAddress.deleteInBackgrounddelete call back          even after mAddress is successfully deleted from parse table and the row doesnt exists. mAddress.getObjectId still has some value which should be null or empty after deletion I believe.        after deletion success option to undo the delete        if the user selects yes   codepre  psaving the old mAddress object to save againp  precodemAddress.saveInBackgroundsave call back         here because the mAddress.getObjectId still has value the parse tries to update the values against the object ID which in background is deleted.  codepre  pany idea on how to tackle this problem is much appreciated.

Negative 30279 h3Contexth3  px8664, intel core 2 duo.p  pI searched through the 3 intel doc volumes, and may have missed the right section, hence the question.p  pA tlb can have up to 4096 entries, that is a lot in my book. But that is not that much in a SMP system after all. Especially if the tlb is not flushed thanks to the tag bit  almost full all the time.p  pImagine the case in which you have your memory properly mapped throughout the 4 page tables. Imagine that you have more than 4096 entries i know.., and that, obviously, it is too much for the tlb.p  pI know that x86 doesnt automatically generate page fault on tlb miss.p  h3Questionh3  pShould I be assured that the mmu will walk the page tables and replace one of the entries strongautomaticallystrong since it is already correctly mapped p  pIt would make sense, since there is nothing more to do on the operating system side, the memory is already mapped.p  pThanksp

Negative 30279 pI am trying to integrate Crashlytics into my app using their supplied plugin in Android Studio.

When I try to build I start getting p  pNo resource found errorsp  pAnd get p  pError2 Error parsing XML prefix must not be bound to one of the reserved namespace namesp  pThe xml that the error is listed in is inside build folder of one of my library projects, its name is values.xml and it worked without a problem before I ran the Crashlytics plugin. Also after running the plugin I cannot build the project from IDE or using gradle from console anymore even after running gradle clean I also can not do git revert because it says none of the files were changed. Only way to restore my project to previous state is to delete the folder and clone it again from remote.p  pDoes anyone know what is going on  What does this plugin do to my build folderp  pAdditional info I am using the latest version of Android studio from Beta channel.

Negative 30279 pI know this must be straight forward but somehow I am not able to get my head around it.p  p Scenario p  pWe are using a system which has a WPF front end, then a DB first entity framework and then a SQL 2008R2 database.p  pmost of the entities that we have are parent child relations. A parent cannot exist without children and hence the stored procedures that we have take p  pParent Data and list of child data, here list of child data is passed as XML after serializing the entire list using XML Serializer.p  pAll this was working fine until we have to save 500,000 child records. when we try to do this XML Serializer fails complaining about out of memory. Then I tried to send child records in batches of 10,000 which executes the query and saves the data but atomicity is then lost coz its just a for loop like this..p  precode For Each batchList In groups.Split10000      Dim serializer As New XmlListSerializerOf someObjectbatchList.ToList, Data      Dim xml  serializer.ToXmlString      efContext.AddDataCTypeaddedParentId.Value, Short, xml, DatasomeObject  Next codepre  pWhere add data is function import mapped to stored procedure.p  p Question p  pNow my question here is, what is the right way to add multiple child records into database while keeping the atomicity of the operation active.p  pAlso, the above mentioned way is dead slow, for hald million recortds it takes 5 minutes which is not acceptable anyway.p

Heres what it saysp  blockquote   pFor generic type parameters, the in keyword specifies that the type   parameter is contravariant. You can use the in keyword in generic   interfaces and delegates. p      pContravariance enables you to use a less   derived type than that specified by the generic parameter. This allows   for implicit conversion of classes that implement variant interfaces   and implicit conversion of delegate types. Covariance and   contravariance in generic type parameters are supported for reference   types, but they are not supported for value types. p      pA type can be   declared contravariant in a generic interface or delegate if it is   used only as a type of method arguments and not used as a method   return type. Ref and out parameters cannot be variant. p      pAn interface   that has a contravariant type parameter allows its methods to accept   arguments of less derived types than those specified by the interface   type parameter. For example, because in .NET Framework 4, in the   IComparer interface, type T is contravariant, you can assign an   object of the IComparerOf Person type to an object of the   IComparerOf Employee type without using any special conversion   methods if Employee inherits Person. p      pA contravariant delegate can be   assigned another delegate of the same type, but with a less derived   generic type parameter.p blockquote  pI suppose this makes sense, but particularly citingp  blockquote   pContravariance enables you to use a less derived type than that   specified by the generic parameter.p blockquote  pHow can it be of any use to an codeintcode Is there any less derived type I would ever pass in p

Negative 30279 pWed like to create an enterprise data model EDM at the entity or, maybe, attribute, level to develop a logical view of all the data we capture. We will also be purchasing, or building, a packaged data model to house our data warehouse  data marts. If we capture information about entities amp attributes in the EDM eg field definitions, lineage information, ..., is there any way to share this with the DW  DMs so that a change in the EDM will automatically propagate to the downstream models or must this info be manually copied between the models. Note that we likely wont have the option to generate our physical models from our logical model. Thanks Benp

Negative 30279 pThe a hrefhttpswww.mediawiki.orgwikiExtensionCharInsert relnofollowMediaWiki CharInsert extensiona is an extension that enables the usage of codeltcharinsertgtltcharinsertgtcode tags on Wiki pages. These tags provide a JavaScript popup to allow the insertion of set pieces of wikitext into articles. It also creates a Wiki page called codeMediaWikiEdittoolscode on which users can add, within charinsert tags, pieces of wikitext they can insert into Wiki pages with a single click. I have difficulty explaining this clearly so Im going to use the below screenshot to help me explain it. p  pThis is the WYSIWIG wiki text editor, with the edittools toolbox shown. If you click on any of the buttons e.g., the codeltnowikigtltnowikigtcode one it will insert the wikitext shown in the button you click into the WYSIWIG editor shown above. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY5g6V.png altenter image description herep  pNow the reason for this question is that Id like to be able to modify the CharInsert extension so that its possible to insert different wikitext than that used for the displayed title for the JavaScript JS button. One way I thought this could be done, would be to add an attribute, say content. I am mentioning this because it helps me explain what I mean, say for example the Edittools page includes a line p  precodeltcharinsert content  Information0ADescription0ASource0ADate0ALicense0AAuthor0AgtInformationltcharinsertgt codepre  pthen, while only codeInformationcode would appear in the edittools toolbox, codeInformation0ADescription0ASource0ADate0ALicense0AAuthor0Acode would be what this button would insert into the WYSIWIG editor. p  pDoes anyone know how I would modify the CharInsert extension to enable it to do this Keeping in mind I know little about PHP, so please dont give me some programmer discourse that would be helpful to an experienced PHP programmer but useless to a novice like me. So please give me simple instructions of exactly what to add to which i.e., you tell me which PHP script file.p  pI have asked this question on the a hrefhttpswww.mediawiki.orgwikiExtensiontalkCharInsertFeaturerequestAccesskey35114 relnofollowExtensionTalkCharInserta page at MediaWiki.org, which sent me to a hrefhttpsphabricator.wikimedia.orgT25354 relnofollowthisa issue on Phabricator and I tried the technique mentioned in the patch provided but it did not work see the charinsert talk page for details, this was a while ago so I cant remember them off hand, probably because of how old this patch is 5 years now. I am asking this question here months later as I still havent received a useful reply. p  pIf relevant I am using MediaWiki 1.25.1.p
Negative 30279 pI have a UITableView that reads information from CoreData via the proper mechanisms using a FetchedResultsController, etc.  This information is either textual, or a URL to a local image to load into the tableview.p  pData needs to be populated in the table in a bottomup fashion similar to a messaging app. I am targeting iOS 8, but if I use estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath, I get terrible jerkiness on 3 multi line labels and images.  The estimate seems way too far off unless its a one line UILabel.  My hunch is that the cell height is being estimated in a top down manner, such that cell heights are growing from top of cell to bottom of cell.  This means that scrolling top to bottom is fine, but bottom to top is not, since the cell is being resized downward dynamically as I scroll upward.p  pI am currently using heightForRowAtIndexPath to calculate cell heights.  The problem with this is that it takes a very long time for the view to initially load because cell heights are all calculated at once.  I am using cell height caching to store cell height so that once the view has loaded, scrolling is buttery smooth.p  pstrongSo my question is thisstrong how do you use heightForRowAtIndexPath without taking the 35 second initial load hit  p  pAnd follow up bonus question, is there any way to reliably use estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath when you have cells that are vastly different in height  Were talking anywhere from 44px to 300px.  From what Ive read, I cant use the estimatedHeight calculation at all in this situation.p  pIve exhausted all of the stackoverflow posts concerning estimatedHeightheightForRowAtIndexPath and Im now starting to look at the same posts more than once.  So Im stuck.p

Negative 30279 pIm trying to combine Mandrill service with another API that can send http POSTs to it, to merge variables into a template and send an email. The issue is that its hard to make this other API send a JSON object just like the one Mandrills API is expecting.p  pThe other API can easilly send flat JSONs like p  pcodenamesome name,firstvar10,secondvar20code, p  pbut its hard to make it create a complex JSON, with inner arrays and so on.p  pAnother issue with the JSON format understood by Mandrill is that, within globalmergevars, name value pairs arent pairedp  precode[  nameMyVariable , content123  ,    nameSecondVariable , content321 ]  codepre  pInstead ofp  precode[  MyVariable123 ,      SecondVariable321  ] codepre  pWhich makes things a bit harder.p  pSo what Id like to know is if its possible for Mandrill to merge other variables than those within the globalmergevars or mergevars arrays and reference them by their name value relation.p  pIf you know of another solution or service that would suite the case presented, I would also apreciate.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 30279 pstrongMy Problemstrongp  hr  pI have a fixedsize ArrayList which contains custom variables. Despite of the ArrayList having a fixed size, sometimes a lot of them will actually be null. The thing is that I need to return the ArrayList without the null variables inside it. strongemOne important thing to noteemstrong emthe ArrayList will have all of its nonnull items first, and then all of the nulls below them, e.g., the elements are not mixed.

Negative 30279 pI am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comcschuhmacher1995ngfeedback relnofollowngfeedbacka with an authentication based Web Application. There is a variable called loggedIn which obviously tells if you are logged in or not. p  pMy Problem is, when I am logged out, I want the FeedbackButton to hide, which works when you first load the page. But if you logout of a session, the button wont disappear. The variable loggedIn on its own is fine, other directives will disappear on logout and the console log also says that it is false.p  pAlthough this is annoying, it is less problematic as I can restrict it in the backend. The more annoying part is, that if I log back in and send a feedback, it will send 2 Posts instead of 1. And if I log out and in 5 times, it will do 5 PostRequests.p  pI Also tried to disable the button on its own within the bowerpackage, but I cant get access to Angularmethods there.p  pIs there any solution to make the button completely disappear after logoutp

Negative 30279 pI translated a Mathematica code to R. The code involves a while loop. I think I translated everything correctly but the Mathematica code needs 15 and the R code 8 iterations to converge. Moreover, the results differ.

Negative 30279 pI am building a simple QRcode scanning system in Swift using Parse as my backend. I have built one app that scans a QRcode, and thereafter updates it to active  false. p  pI have also built a separate app that generates new QRcodes for the first app to scan. I want to enable the second app to generate a new QRcode to display once the first app has scanned the current one. p  pOne way I think I could solve this would be by constantly with an interval query parse.com to check if the object has changed has been updated from active  true to active  false, but this would mean that I have to send a lot of unnecessary queries to parse, which will be costly as there is a limit to how many queries you can send for free. p  pIs there any other way I can let my second app know that the first app has scanned the QRcodep  pAll help is much appreciatedp

Negative 30279 pHow can I convert words to vectors Word embedding if I dont have a predefined dictionary of words Most word embedding implementations like a hrefhttpscode.google.compword2vec relnofollowWord2veca and a hrefhttpnlp.stanford.eduprojectsglove relnofollowGloVea have a fixed dictionary of words. The input to the neural networks are onehot encoded and the hidden layer sizes also depend on the vocab size, which makes adding a new word later on without retraining all the vectors again impossible.

The code above prints Destructor called only once. I declared two MyClass instances inside main, one of them is a normal variable of type MyClass, and other is a pointer of same type pointing to the normal variable. There is no need of destructor here no dynamic allocations but I defined one in the class for a sake of example. So, because two class instances are defined, the destructor should be called twice. But that doesnt happened when I run this code. If I remove the pointer and define one more normal instance, the program printsp  pDestructor called Destructor calledp  pMy observation is that destructors are not implicitly called when a pointer instance goes out of scope. Am I right or just missing something.p
