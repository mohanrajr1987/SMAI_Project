Positive 9 pFollowing situation I got a little helper which shows the user what settings are wrong. In this particular case its a textbox which specifies the output path. An adorner highlights the textbox by drawing rectangles of halfopaque rectangles around it. Now Id like to disable hit tests for the are which is grayed out, so that the user can only use the control that is highlighted. Another adorner shows a cancel button in the right lower corner of the application which allows to cancel this highlighting mode.p  pIs it possible to deactivate hit tests for all other controls or might it be possible to specify a codeGeometrycode which filters hit tests Ive seen you can do hit tests based on a codeGeometrycode but that seems to be a manual hit test to find a certain control but not to filter actual hit tests.p  pDisabling and reenabling would be a lot of overhead since you would have to iterate through the whole codeVisualTreecode...p  pWhats the easiest method Id really like it if it was possible using a Geometry or similiar.p
Positive 9 pI currently implementing a desktop application for my ASP.NET website. I am trying to use codeWebBrowsercode class to allow user to login to the site and then use codeWebClientcode to make api calls afterward. Based on research and experiment,  codeWebBrowsercode class and IE share the same cookie which is good. But I am having a hard time copying the authenticated cookie into codeCookieContainercode for my codeWebClientcode. p  pI tried to use codeApplication.GetCookiecode which calls codeInternetGetCookiecode Win32API to get the cookie from IE, the problem is that it does not return the authentication cookie. It only returns cookies set by my site such as Language and User preferences. The cookie should be persistent cookie since I am still logged in after I close and reopen the browser. Any thoughtsp

Positive 9 pI have written a program to synchronise the My Pictures folder with Flickr. It has a thread which is supposed to start at 8pm when my Internet bandwidth is free, upload stuff until 6 am or the job is complete, and then wait until 8pm the next day before doing it again.  In order to allow the UI thread to interrupt the waits, I am using WaitOne if the UI thread signals, the upload thread exits.  This works fine for the initial wait, but waiting until the next day never returns from the wait  I wonder if the fact that the computer is going to sleep in the interim is somehow messing it up  The code is on a hrefhttpsgithub.comnikkilockeMyPicturesSync relnofollowGithuba Uploader.cs...p  precode     ltsummarygt      Wait until start time if specified      ltsummarygt      ltparam namenextgtWait until start time tomorrowltparamgt      ltreturnsgttrue if stop signal was receivedltreturnsgt     bool Waitbool next          DateTime start  DateTime.Now          Have they specified to start and stop in the same day, and we have already passed stop time         if Settings.Default.Start lt Settings.Default.Stop ampamp start.Hour gt Settings.Default.Stop             next  true         if next  start.Hour lt Settings.Default.Start              string day               start  new DateTimestart.Year, start.Month, start.Day, Settings.Default.Start, 0, 0             if next ampamp start.Hour gt Settings.Default.Start                  start  start.AddDays1                 day   on   start.ToStringdddd                          Form.LogWaiting until 0HHmm1, start, day             if signal.WaitOnestart  DateTime.Now                  Form.StatusInterrupted                 return true                                Have they specified a stop time         stop  Settings.Default.Stop gt 24  DateTime.MaxValue  new DateTimestart.Year, start.Month, start.Day, Settings.Default.Stop, 0, 0         if stop lt start             stop  stop.AddDays1         return false        codepre

I did some research and it appears I can save this dataset in server cache, which would allow it to be instantly accessible to all users, without the need to reload XML every time for each user p  pThis is my code at the moment, please let me know if something is bad since I have no idea about ASP.NET.

Negative 9 pAre there any UPS WorldShip integration APIS or Libraries out there for .net Ive been tasked with integrating our Sample Order application A VB.NetSQL Server app with UPS, and having it write .xml files for the auto import feature though serialization has gotten my foot in the door but some of the more advanced shipment options such as international customs options are completely undocumented. p  pHow did you get UPS integration up and running Did you have any 3rd party help doing it Is there a better location for documentation Im just missingp  pstrongEDITstrong What Im trying to do is create new shipments based on order data in my database and then update those orders with the tracking number the shipment received from UPS.

Negative 9 pThis started as a way to find CCLI and Managed C assemblies so that all classes internal to them could be tested to ensure all inherited methods were being reimplemented.  I would like to add this as a build process step to ensure that it never happens again.p  pThinking about this problem also made me a bit curious as it would be interesting to be able to determine any .NET language used.  Because of this, I went a bit further and compared assemblies from all of the .NET languages.  So far here is what Ive found through a small program I wrote which compares the type and attribute data from any set of .NET assemblies via reflectionp  ul liC  Has AssemblyConfigurationAttribute, Has GuidAttributeli liVB  Has many extra My type ex. MyApplication, MySettings, Has GuidAttibuteli liF  Has a FSharpInterfaceDataVersionAttribute which also specifies the version of the compiler used.li liC all but clrsafe  Has a bunch of extra types FrameInfo, typeinfoli liC clrsafe  Seems to have no unique reflection features.  li ul  pIt might be reasonable to parse in this orderp  ol liIts F if it has the FSharpInterfaceDataVersionAttribute li liIts C if it has any in the huge set of extra types I found.li liIts VB if it has the My Types.  li liIts C if it has AssemblyConfigurationAttribute or GuidAttributeli liIts likely to be C clrSafeli ol  pHowever, as this is a horrible hack, I wanted to check in here to make sure that there wasnt another option available.p

Negative 9 pSomething strange happened at least for me  , as I know in a 3 tier model you make DLLs and let your UI make a reference to them , right now Im working like this ClassLibrary project for the DAL, another one for the BLL with reference to the DAL DLL located on the DAL bindebug directory so that the BLL ClassLibrary project implements the DAL changes immediately , then a Windows Application project with references to both BLL and DAL DLLs located on their respective bindebug directories . Then I wanted to test and to examine the exceptions generated when the aplication cant find the DLLs its referencing  , I cutted the DLLs and putted them in another location , the Application is still working fine  , thats was strange enough but I guessed maybe when running the Windows application it recreates those DLLs again so I put those DLLs on another folder in the Desktop and I delete the old references from the Windows application and recreated them pointing this time to the ones on the Desktop folder and tested it , after that I delete the Desktop folder and the application still working fine and connecting to the database and every thing  Environment XP SP2 VisualStudio 2008 Cp

Negative 9 pI am playing with OSGi and have a few bundles. Bundle A and B both contain a registered service which implement a single interface. The third bundle C includes code to lookup a service implementing the previously mentioned interface. The A and B bundles have different version numbers however it appears that C picks up the service from the first started bundle. I have changed the start level to do the right thing but version is only used to accept rather than order which service is returned.p  precode   A version 1.0 start level 1    B version 1.1 start level 2    C requires both bundles, start level 3 codepre  pIn the above example C always gets the service from A even though B has a higher bundle version. However if i switch the start level so B starts before A then C seens the B service. p  pI have searched the OSGi website and there is no clear explaination of whether versioning of a bundle is used to prioritise a service over another. My understanding seems to indicate that start level is supposed to be used to order bundle startup so that dependencies can be satisified correctly. However it appears to be overloaded so that it also prioritises service priority. Given allt he above i guess it makes sense not to use the bundle version in selection because the versionnumber is just a number relative to nothing. p  pWhat is the best way to prioritise one service over another, besides start levelp

FOO foo ULONG dataLength  offsetofFOO, CharData  sizeoffoo.CharData codepre  pObviously, the code tries to figure out the number of interesting bytes in the struct, when using the CharData member of the union. My problem is, that the compiler warns about the union being unnamed. So I change it intop  precodetypedef struct  STRUCTFOO    ULONG FooInfo        union                     ULONG  LongData     USHORT ShortData     UCHAR  CharData    FooData  FOO codepre  pBut then of course I also need to change the last line. Will the following always yield exactly the same results as the originalp  precodeULONG dataLength  offsetofFOO, FooData  sizeoffoo.FooData.CharData codepre  por is it possible, that CharData or ShortData or LongData will not be aligned at the beginning of the union p  p edit Thank you for your answers.

There are many   ways to get into trouble with two   CRTs. Here are just a fewp      ul   liThere are two separate heaps. You cannot allocate explicitly with new,   malloc, or so on  or implicitly with   strdup, strstreambufstr, or so on,   and then pass the pointer across a   CRTboundary to be freed.li   liYou cannot pass a FILE or file handle across a CRTboundary and   expect the stdio lowlevel IO to   work.li   liYou cannot set the locale in one and expect the others locale to be set. li   ul      pBeginning with Visual C 4.0, the   linker will issue a warning LNK4098   if a resulting module attempts to   combine more than one copy of the CRT   library.

Negative 9 pI have recently upgraded my .Net 3.5 solution containing some C code projects and a ASP.net web site project to VS2010 from VS2008. It is building and running fine inside VS, but I get some problems when trying to build it on my server with MSBuild 4.0 via TeamCity. It seems like the projects that are referenced from the web site are not built. This was all working fine before I upgraded to VS2010, MSbuild 4.0 and Windows SDK 7.1.p  pInside the msbuild script that I use to build from teamcity I have defined project references for the web site like thisp  precode  ltProjectReference Include..srctrunkDataAccessDataAccess.csprojgt      ltProjectgtC43242F472864BEC9A27001D6FC14860ltProjectgt      ltNamegtDataAccessltNamegt   ltProjectReferencegt codepre  pWhen I try to run the build script I get an error message saying that it could not find the dll file when trying to copy it from the bin folder of the referenced project into the bin folder of the web site. This is happening because the referenced projects are in fact never built at all No bin folder exists in the project dir.p  pDoes anyone have a clue what may cause this I am not very experienced with MSbuild, so I may have overlooked some important stuff. Is it not so that MSbuild will automatically try to build the referenced projects if no project output is existingp  pWill be thankful for any helpp

Negative 9 pMaybe I can summarize the question If a Rails app goes into Maintenance for 30 minutes and the Rails Session Store is changed from using cookies to using DB, then any user who  has the browser open wont be able to use the Rails apps for any session store capability unless the user clears all the cookies or restart the browser.  Is there a way to fix this behavior because users who didnt do that will get stuck and possibly frustrated.p  hr  pDetailsp  pTo understand Rails session store better, I created a new project that at first uses cookie as the session store using Rails 2.3.8 with Ruby 1.8.7...p  pand values can be stored in the session.  and then without closing the browser, I stopped the Rails server, removed the codecode in front of p  precodeActionControllerBase.sessionstore  activerecordstore codepre  pand did a coderake dbsessionscreatecode and then a coderake dbmigratecode to create a codesessionscode table in the DB.p  pBut now, my browser was never closed, and when I print out the session variables, it wont work, and when I set some values into the session, using codeFoosControllershowcode, and print out the session values in codeFoosControllerindexcode in the view.  Although the values can be set in codeshowcode, they dont show up in codeindexcode.  I have to clear out the cookies in my browser or exit my browser and start it up again, so that the values can be set in codeshowcode and then codeindexcode will show it correctly now.p  pI guess for a thing like changing the session store from cookie to DB, the server will be shut down, meaning the site will be down for a few minutes to a couple of hours... but the users may not close the browser during this time... and p  p1 any session values that was set previously wont show probably acceptablebr 2 any new session values set by the server now also will strongnotstrong go into the users session store.p  pI think 1 above is ok, but 2 can drive the user crazy... keeping on trying for 30 minutes, and wait an hour, or two hours later, still wont work for example, cannot log in and read a second page as a logged in user, because codesession[userid]code cannot be set successfully.  The user will probably call tech support and the tech support may or may not suggest clearing the cookie... but is a pretty crude way to fix something.  or restart the browser will work too... but the user may have so many tabs open that he actually need to go through all the tabs and bookmark anything and then close and restart the browser.p  pSo it this true for a Rails server  Or somebody know the newer versions of Rails already fixed that issuep

Negative 9 pI have a strange issue. I have a static method that loads classes loadlibrary.

Negative 9 pIve got a few layout classes in an application of mine, and a few of them are layoutcontainer classes that arrange contained components in a certain fashion. By the nature of this arrangement, when the object has to move, it calls codeUpdatePositioncode and arranges and moves the contained objects again.p  pI was wondering whether it would be more efficient to have these containers draw their child components to a texture, and then just have that texture drawn each frame and redrawn if the components change.p  pI suppose the tradeoff here is memory vs. CPU, but Im not sure what the scaling is on either end of that tradeoff i.e, whether one option should be definitely taken beyond a certain margin. Obviously simple objects that just draw two textures can be kept as they are, but heavier containers that have 50 objects would be a lot smoother with a single texture, I think.p  pAny adviceguidance is appreciated,br Jengererp

Negative 9 pI have an application which has some classes that handle some specific functions, have a lifetime equal to the application itself, and are meant to be used in many parts of the program. For this last reason i call them Services.

Negative 9 pFor examplep  pMy first column in the array is at first numerically in order. The Second column is numerically random. I want to place the second column in order, which of course will force the first column out of order. Any ideas how to do this in java. I have searched, but cant seem to find the vocabulary to properly find it.p
Negative 9 pCurrently I am searching for an appropiate way to find prices in an image. The images are colored and are taken with a camera or smartphone. I already have done some proprocessing like color thresholding, morph. reconstruction and other steps to locate and crop the region where the prices are placed.  Now I want to do the recognition of prices. p  pIn our project we already have tried some OCR frameworks to be precise Tesseract with Tessjeract and also JOCR, but the recognition of numbers in photos is very bad. We also have done some experiments with preprocessed images color thresholding, opening, segmentation and so on. But with the tested frameworks no satisfiying results were reached.p  pWe also considered that neural networks could be a good way, but all project members havent enough knowledge about them and there is a very short space of project time. Now we are looking for a framework which is able to find numbers in preprocessed images.p  pCould anybody suggest a framework, favoured a Java framework, which could do thisp  pI would be pleased if there are some suggestions.p

Negative 9 pI am using ExpressCheckout and testing Paypal in the sandbox. Ive noticed if I set a higher amount of codePAYMENTREQUESTnAMTcode in codeDoExpressCheckoutPaymentcode then in codeSetExpressCheckoutcode e.g. 30 USD in codeSetExpressChecoutcode, 50 USD in codeDoExpressCheckoutPaymentcode, Paypal will transfer 50 USD to my sandbox business account from my sandbox personal account.p  pIs it because this is a sandbox server or something I should know p  pI am constructing a website which is required to charge an advance from the buyer and collect what remains of the net price a few days later. If this is a feature of Paypal Express Checkout, I will set the amount of advance in codeSetExpressCheckoutcode and the total Net Price in codeDoExpressCheckoutPaymentcode. Thereafter, the buyer will only see the advance amount in Paypal to decrease the confusion. If we said we only charge the advance, but in Paypal show the total amount of net price, it might cause confusion.p  pIn my test it works in the sandbox, but Paypal will reply codeSUCCESSPAGEREDIRECTREQUESTEDtruecode in this situation. Paypal documentation explains Flag to indicate whether you would like to redirect the buyer to sign up for PayPal after completing the transaction. What does that mean  Could you please clarify this for mep

The NEW and CURRENT use both CentOs which will make the transision easy, except the Windows server that I have no idea what to do now. p  pNow the bad news. The NEW system database schema is not good at all.  It is not normalized and the queries are slow database queries and the code too.  My first idea is to redesign them to a more normalized structure that matches the CURRENT code but I dont work.  The tables from the NEW system are gigantic. The NEW system has 7 databases, over 10000 tables, the smallest tables have over 100k rows and some tables have over 500 millions rows.  One of the database has most of the tables with over 25 millions rows each. p  pIs it safe to migrate or should I keep both running  If I should migrate I want to know what will the safest solution for me in order to migrate the Windows and NEW system into my CURRENT systemp

Negative 9 pI wrote a C DLL using VS 2010 which is used to wrap some program that does boolean operations on polygons.Its structure is as follows There is a main header and .cpp whose methods are exposed by  marks p  precode  declspecdllexport  codepre  pThen inside one of those method I execute a call of one of the methods of my polygon program which is contained in a different c class which is a part of the  library.I should note that in addition to calling that method I also createin the main dll .cpp file variables which are defined in that polygons program.Those variables are of types required to pass and receive numeric data from the polygon program. Now ,what is wrong.When I run the an application that uses this dll I do two identical calls to  the same method of the library the one I explained above that calls a function of the polygon program.When I do those calls I pass some numeric data into the method and expect to get back a new data based on some calculations in the polygons program.First call returns the correct data but the second one returns kind of mix of the data from the first call and the second input data.I am not DLL expert but I took a look at this thread p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1433204whatareexternvariablesincWhat are extern variables in Cap  pAnd I wonder if that may be the source of the problem As I mentioned I use some variables which are part of the polygon calculation class and I instantiate them in the main .cpp of the dll. Two of those variables take the input data from the user and get it into the method that calculates the result and the third  variable is filled with the result returned by that function. Any help will be greatly appreciated as I am really stuck with it at the moment.p  pEDIT The variables I use from the polygon source class are defined in its header as followsp  precode typedef stdvectorlt IntPoint gt Polygon  typedef stdvectorlt Polygon gt Polygons codepre  pstrongDLL Test programstrongp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include Clipperlib.h  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]  int subj[]100,100,200,100,200,200,100,200 int clip[]100,100,200,100,200,200,100,200 vectorltvectorltintgtgt solution vectorltvectorltintgtgt solution1 Executesubj,clip,solution  Executesubj,clip,solution1   return 0  codepre  pstrongDLL header strongp  precode include clipper.hpp   this is the working C class of polygons operations  include ltvectorgt  using namespace ClipperLib  using namespace std  extern Polygon subj  extern Polygon clip  extern Polygons solution   extern C   declspecdllexport void Executeint subj[],int clip[],vectorltvectorltintgtgt ampsolution    codepre  pstrongDLL .cppstrongp  precode Clipperlib.cpp  Defines the exported functions for the DLL application.  include Clipperlib.h  Clipper clipper  void Executeint subj[],int clip[],vectorltvectorltintgtgt ampsolution  Polygon subjPnew Polygon Polygon clipPnew Polygon Polygons solutionPnew Polygons     forint i0 ilt8i2       subjPgtpushbackIntPointsubj[i],subj[i1]       forint b0blt8b2       clipPgtpushbackIntPointclip[b],clip[b1]    clipper.Clear  clipper.AddPolygonsubjP,ptSubject  clipper.AddPolygonclipP,ptClip  clipper.ExecutectIntersection,solutionP for vectorltPolygongtsizetype d0dsolutionPgtsized     vectorltintgt poly     solution.pushbackpoly      forvectorltIntPointgtsizetype k0ksolutionP[d].sizek          forvectorltIntPointgtsizetype s0ssolutionP[d][k].sizes              int numXintsolutionP[d][k][s].X             int numYintsolutionP[d][k][s].Y             solution[d].pushbacknumX                 solution[d].pushbacknumY                      delete solutionP delete subjP delete clipP codepre  pp

Negative 9 pSorry if this has been answered already, but I think I actually lack the formal education to ask this question properly, and hence also lack the correct criteria to search for it successfully.p  pI have an API that has several calls that do almost the same thing, but act on different input objects using a different method, but always form the same interface. I want to take the cut amp paste aspect out of the API method call processes so that the common code gets done the same in all method invocations. I have managed to get a working solution using generics for the input and output objects and am making a reference to the methodname to be invoked from a string. I would like references to the the methods to be strongly typed instead of string based, so that a rename of the method name when refactoring would not potentially leave the magic string of the method name waiting to explode at runtime.p  pBelow is a very simplified version of what I am trying to achieve. p  precodeclass ARequest   class AResponse   class BRequest   class BResponse    interface IWorker      AResponse DoAARequest aRequest     BResponse DoBBRequest bRequest  class Worker  IWorker      public AResponse DoAARequest aRequest              return new AResponse          public BResponse DoBBRequest bRequest              return new BResponse        class Program      static void Mainstring[] args               current concrete copy amp paste implementation         var a1  API.DoAnew ARequest           var b1  API.DoBnew BRequest            new generic implementation         var a2  API.DoA2new ARequest           var b2  API.DoB2new BRequest          static class API       current concrete copy amp paste implementation     public static AResponse DoAARequest aRequest               lots of common code for logging amp preperation         var worker  GetWorker         return worker.DoAaRequest          public static BResponse DoBBRequest bRequest               lots of common code for logging amp preperation         var worker  GetWorker         return worker.DoBbRequest          private static IWorker GetWorker              return new Worker           new generic implementation Attempt     public static AResponse DoA2ARequest aRequest              return DoGenltARequest, AResponsegtaRequest, DoA  how to make references to DoA and DoB methods on the IWorker strongly typed          public static BResponse DoB2BRequest bRequest              return DoGenltBRequest, BResponsegtbRequest, DoB  how to make references to DoA and DoB methods on the IWorker strongly typed          public static TResponse DoGenltTRequest, TResponsegtTRequest requestObj, string methodname         where TRequest  class         where TResponse  class               lots of common code for logging amp preperation         var worker  GetWorker         var mi  worker.GetType.GetMethodmethodname         var result  mi.Invokeworker, new Object[]  requestObj          return result as TResponse        codepre

Negative 9 pIm relatively new to web services so sorry if this is elementary.  I have a web service implemented as a .svc file consumed through IIS by another ASP.NET website.  Apparently in such a situation, you dont get the generated proxy classes from adding a service reference.  I dont get the button to show all files and if I inspect what files are present using Windows Explorer, I see only the same ones displayed in Solution Explorer.  Im also using a fairly complex data contract thats returning a custom collection instance which wraps a Listlt of custom objects.  I know the data is coming across ok, because I stored the return value in an IEnumerable object, and a Repeater was able to dig out the fields if I didnt get too fancyhan[0].role worked but it balked at han[i].role.  But what Id like to do is cast the returned collection to the underlying type which the Repeater obviously has some sort of access to but if I try casting to it, lacking the generated proxy classes where are they are they there at all, there doesnt seem to be anything I can cast it TO.  How can I get access to the underlying type so I can cast to it and then have full, direct access to all the fields in the underlying objects  Please helpp

Negative 9 pim trying to set up a simple form where you can type a pin and submit it to switch to another movieclip. Im using Flash CS5 and ActionScript 3. I have some MovieClips which get resized on a RESIZE Event. The movieclips get perfectly resized to the stages size so they fill it out.p  pThe problem i have is the scaling.p  pTo avoid scaling everything i used the following two lines.p  precodestage.align  StageAlign.TOPLEFT stage.scaleMode  StageScaleMode.NOSCALE codepre  pI see the stage is aligned to the top left. But still if i resize my browser or even the flash preview CTRLEnter in Adobe Flash all elements like the textbox, the label and the button are resized proportionally.p  pI just want to keep the widthheight of these elemenst, no matter what size the stage has. So if someone resizes his browser making the stage a bigger player, it is like the elements now have more space to use, but instead the space they have is the same because everything is stretched. So even if have the SWF being shown in my FullHD view, still the elements have only something like 550x400 pixel in total because thats the default size of my flash document based on the properties settings.p  pCan anybody help solving this Because i want to load images on the next screen. So if the browsers width is 1000 pixel i would get something like 10 images in a row. But if the browser resizes to 2000 pixels because the user just clicked on the Maximize button for the browser window, then obviously my flash document should print 20 images in a row as there are now another 1000 pixels of space. You know what i meanp  pThanks in advance.p  pEDIT Just to be clearer. I started a new flash project trying to reproduce this problem only to be sure that its not because of bad code.p  pI created a new FLA project. Added a simple rectangle, converted it into MovieClip and named its instance mc. then i created a second layer for the actionscript part. I added the following codep  precodeimport flash.display.StageScaleMode import flash.display.StageAlign import flash.text.  stage.scaleMode  StageScaleMode.NOSCALE stage.align  StageAlign.TOPLEFT  stage.addEventListenerEvent.RESIZE, resizeListener  function resizeListener eEventvoid    mc.width  stage.stageWidth   mc.height  stage.stageHeight   mc.x  0   mc.y  0   var myTextTextField  new TextField myText.text  This is my new text... mc.addChild myText codepre  pThats it. The resizing works fine, this is what i want as the movieclip mc will act as page so i will have more movieclips resized to stage size to switch between them by using visible property. But still the text appearing on the very top left in the movieclip so in the stage is scaled everytime i resize the window. Whyp

I have a specific copy of a book.  My book can have several status checked out, on shelf, destroyed, smells weirdstickyout of commission.... I needhave two forms in Access.  One for basic info on my book and one to actually update the status.  With a status change theres a significant amount of data that needs to be recorded so this requires a seperate form.  The book form itself just consists of basic information and a small sub form for rental history the book form needs to include current status.  My actual status table has a statusid, bookid, timestamp.  p  pNow... since I didnt know Access would have an issue with it... I left both my book and status forms unbound and filled them with a recorsetquery from VBA.  But then it yelled at me when I tried to connect the two unbound it told me.  I decided thats fine and moved the query over to the actual front end Access Query section to the left and out of the vba and bound my forms appropriately.  BUT NOW.  It says my record set is not updateable.  I assume because I used joins and nested select statements and such to get the current status for the book.  I just need to be able to modify those text fields and I can write the insertupdate whatever myself.  I found a few things on the net saying to create a table but I also read that doesnt work in a multiuser environment.  When the book form is open and the user clicks a button to change the status of my book and the savescloses that status form I do need to be able to requery the book form to show the updated status.  p  pSo... What do I do p

Negative 9 pIs Drools suitable for writing rules for Stemming andor POS tagging  Suggestions for a better rulelanguage are welcome. I read many papers in this field that use the rulebased approach but none of them mentioned what library or framework was used to write the rules.p  pMy rules are like the followingp  precodeif length  3 amp firstletter in group1 and secondletter in group2 then ... if length  3 amp firstletter in group1 and secondletter notin group2 then ... if length  3 amp firstletter notin group1 and secondletter in group2 then ... if length  3 amp firstletter notin group1 and secondletter notin group2 then ... if length  4... codepre  p... and so on. p  pThe problem is that these rules are too many to handle. Imagine that there are ten lettergroups, and that there is a case for each letter belonging to each group. I could easily have over a thousand rules to classify a word correctly. I wrote 30 of those rules in plain C code and that was enough for me to see how inefficient this approach was. I already have my rules organized as a tree on paper. I just need the right framework to insert, represent, tweak, and test them. p  pI hope my question is clear. Thank you.p
Negative 9 pThis is ultimately a problem of geometry. Im using raphaeljs to draw 3  area circles for each item in a series of data.

Negative 9 pI want to capture packets from a crowded network and classify it by user request. I use emjavaem and emjpcapem for capturing packets. now Im using array threads for each req packet. its realy slow and there is many conflicts among threads. strongwhats the best data structure for this purposestrongp  pafter that, Im saving packets reqresponse into a file, that is very slow for such a heavy work. strongwhat should I do for saving my datasstrongp  pthank youp
Negative 9 pI have an app that needs to pull data from a server and insert it into an SQLite database in response to user input. I thought this would be pretty simple  the code that pulls the data from the server is a fairly straightforward subclass of AsyncTask, and it works exactly as I expect it to without hanging the UI thread. I implemented callback functionality for it with a simple interface and wrapped it in a static class, so my code looks like thisp  precodeMyServerCaller.getFolderContentsfolderId, new OnFolderContentsResponseListener      Override     public void onFolderContentsResponsefinal ListltFilesystemEntrygt contents           do something with contents       codepre  pAll still good. Even if the server takes an hour to retrieve the data, the UI still runs smoothly, because the code in getFolderContents is running in the doInBackground method of an AsyncTask which is in a separate thread from the UI. At the very end of the getFolderContents method, the onFolderContentsResponse is called and passed the list of FilesystemEntrys that was received from the server. I only really say all this so that its hopefully clear that my problem is not in the getFolderContents method or in any of my networking code, because it doesnt ever occur there.p  pThe problem arises when I try to insert into a database via my subclass of ContentProvider within the onFolderContentsResponse method the UI always hangs while that code is executing, leading me to believe that despite being called from the doInBackground method of an AsyncTask, the inserts are somehow still running on the UI thread. Heres what the problematic code looks likep  precodeMyServerCaller.getFolderContentsfolderId, new OnFolderContentsResponseListener      Override     public void onFolderContentsResponsefinal ListltFilesystemEntrygt contents          insertContentsIntoDBcontents       codepre  pAnd the codeinsertContentsIntoDBcode methodp  precodevoid insertContentsIntoDBfinal ListltFilesystemEntrygt contents      for FilesystemEntry entry  contents          ContentValues values  new ContentValues         values.putCOLUMN1, entry.attr1         values.putCOLUMN2, entry.attr2          etc.          mContentResolver.insertMyContentProvider.CONTENTURI, values       codepre  pwhere mContentResolver has been previously set to the result of the getContentResolver method.p  pIve tried putting insertContentsIntoDB in its own Thread, like sop  precodeMyServerCaller.getFolderContentsfolderId, new OnFolderContentsResponseListener      Override     public void onFolderContentsResponsefinal ListltFilesystemEntrygt contents          new Threadnew Runnable              Override             public void run                  insertContentsIntoDBcontents                      .run       codepre  pIve also tried running each individual insert in its own thread the insert method in MyContentProvider is synchronized, so this shouldnt cause any issues therep  precodevoid insertContentsIntoDBfinal ListltFilesystemEntrygt contents      for FilesystemEntry entry  contents          new Threadnew Runnable              Override             public void run                  ContentValues values  new ContentValues                 values.putCOLUMN1, entry.attr1                 values.putCOLUMN2, entry.attr2                  etc.                 mContentResolver.insertMyContentProvider.CONTENTURI, values                      .run       codepre  pAnd just for good measure, Ive also tried both of those solutions with the relevant code in the doInBackground method of another AsyncTask. Finally, Ive explicitly defined MyContentProvider as living in a separate process in my AndroidManifest.xmlp  precodeltprovider androidname.MyContentProvider androidprocessremotegt codepre  pIt runs fine, but it strongstill seems to run in the UI threadstrong. Thats the point where I really started tearing my hair out over this, because that doesnt make any sense at all to me. No matter what I do, the UI always hangs during the inserts. Is there any way to get them not top

Negative 9 pstrongTLDR  How do I create Relationship Segues in Xcode 4.4strongp  pHello everyone, I have an app where I want to add some tabbing behaviour to one of my controllers but, due to design decisions, I cant use UITabbar. I already know about using a UIToolbar with a UISegmented control inside it, but where Im having difficulty, is how to switch between view controllers.p  pI know I cant use normal segues since each tab change would keep stacking a new controller on top of the previous, but UITabBar has something called Relationship Segues. I looked around but couldnt figure out how to create one.p  pDoes anyone know how do it Also, is there a better way to approach this problemp  pThanksp

Negative 9 pIm rewriting software for a HID device reader to allow Linux support and Im having a bit of trouble debugging it.  On Windows, I use a tool called a hrefhttpcode.google.compbusdog relnofollowBusdoga, which lets you pick a device and log the writeread reports.  It manages this by installing a custom driver to sniff the traffic.p  pThe Linuxbased library Im using communicates directly with the device using lsusb, so there is no driver interaction.  Does anyone know how I might trace the traffic between my app and the USB device p  pNote Ive tried dumping the data from my app before writing to the device, and everything looks fine.  If I run my compiled app in Windows, however, busdog is showing incorrect data being written to the device. This indicates theres a problem with the library Im using hidapi.h.  Id like to confirm this, if I can, in Linux.p

Negative 9 pI am stuck with quite complex topic. I am trying to come up with some universal solution for data validation. We have system, that is similar to cell phone company customer management system, where customers has its accounts full of informationcosts, payments, personal information, events archive, debts etc. and I need to validate this data in multiple situations. I cant forgot that there are various accounts and some of them need specific validating. What I cant figure out, is some universal, simple and reusable system to this work. p  pMain idea is, that there will be many constraints that will be usedlike customer has to have name, if there is debt, there cant be overpayment, etc., and also there will be defined situationslike account canceling, demand for payment send etc. when I want validate dataexecution of validation from code is not topic here. Situation will have list of constraints that are validated, or executed for it. This is what we want.p  pstrongBut what is right java approach to thisstrong Should all situations and constraints be classes Situations will have constraints instances, and instances will have validate methods But each will have different arguments. Any other ideasp  pI know, answer here can be long, so I will appreciate directing me on some documentation on that topic to. strongThanks a lot for answersstrongp

Negative 9 pI am using jena framework to process my owl ontology. p  pI want to write a method which can find the super class it belongs which is just under the Thing class. p  pFour example, if there are 5 level hierarchy, lets say first level is Thing, second level is secondAncestor, third level is ThirdAncestor and so on. If I pass a class FifthAncestor, I want to return SecondAncestor because Thing does not make any sense.  If I pass ThirdAncestor, I want to return SecondAncestor. In other words, most general class it belongs to but not the top one Thing. p
Negative 9 pI have created a codePlayercode class which extends codeMovieClipcode and contains an array of F4V files being loaded via codeLoaderMax.parsecode ... In my Main Document Class codeMaincode I want to transform properties of the entire Player class x, y, alpha, scale, etc. however the F4V does not see the transformations....It seems I have to reference the content directly from the Main class. For example, if i simply try to set codeplayer.visiblefalsecode, after ive already added video content to the stage, It does not stick, but if I reference codeplayer.video.content.visiblefalsecode, it works...p  pWhat Im really trying to do is fade the player object out before I navigate back to a main navigation screen. I can fade each codevideo.contentcode individually but Id rather just write one tween that effects the whole class. Am I missing something simple or is this larger than I thinkp  p...additionally, these transformations DO work with NetStream driving the f4vs. But looping w netStream is ugly , as we know.p

That way I never need to remove the disabled property from the visible datepicker, and I can use the hiddenfield value in vb.p  pI have a jquery datepicker ui input that is auto calculated from a different datepicker. I need to get the value of the datepicker in VB so I disable it html side, then enable it on form submit in jquery so that the value will pass to VB.p  pThe problem is when I submit form and there are validation errors that cause a postback, the code still runs through the submit function and enables the input. Now the user can pick any date they want, when it needs to stay as the auto calculated date.p  pI changed it from disabled to readonly, but while readonly datepickers cant be typed in they can still be clicked and the picker comes up. Ive tried to move the jquery code that enables the input around, but havent been able to find a better place for it that only runs when the form is actually submitted. Now Im trying to see if there is a way to keep the datepicker from opening when readonly is true.p  pAny ideasp  precode        errorForm.submitfunction             txtPayDate.propdisabled, false           return validateExtraErrors          jquery to enable input, validate, and submit form  ltinput typetext idtxtPayDate nametxtPayDate valueltRequest.FormtxtPayDategt disableddisabledgt input field codepre

Negative 9 pThe doc for the codepopcode function says thatp  precodeusergt doc pop  clojure.corepop [coll]   For a list or queue, returns a new listqueue without the first   item, for a vector, returns a new vector without the last item.

Negative 9 pI am not new to programming but new to C. I am now working on a rather complex project involving control of a simulated robotic arm. I finished a first version of the project and it is working fine. I just added some new code that collect some information about the system at each iteration, save it in some arrays, and at the end prints everything in a file for later analysis.p  pNow, something real strange is happening.

Does not crash, but the robotic arm moves differently. p  pI tried to comment all the code that was making use of SAVEFILE, and even any new code related to data saving, but the problem persists.p  pI know that with only this information, it is unlikely that anybody can tell me what is wrong, but would anybody have some advice what direction to look  Would it make sense to think that a long string overwrite the value of some other variable  How can it be possible  Some guideline of clean C programming I might have broken p  pmany thanksp  hr  pEDIT after first answers and commentsp  pThanks for the answers.

The error is thrown if I test the app manually  which is great. However when I try to test it with Mocha and Expect.js, I get codeError expected fn to throw an exceptioncode. If I switch the code from codeto.throwErrorcode to codeto.not.throwErrorcode the errors are thrown properly.

Negative 9 pIm currently making a game in vb.net that uses the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comengblibrarysystem.drawing.graphics.aspx relnofollowGraphics classa to draw most of the game objects, but ive run into the old problem of performance. To combat the lagging ive added some code to automatically lower the game quality so i can try to boost the games speed, this works to a degree, but even still the game slows down quite noticeable when more enemies are added to the higher levels. I quite new to the graphics class only started to use it a few days ago, so the only things i know that help speed up my game are turning off Anti Aliasing, and lowering the Timer interval which pretty much governs my games refresh rate, so besides the previous, are there any other ways to improve my games performancep  pGame screenshot... img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuaVAA.jpg altScreenshotp

Negative 9 pMy question is quite simple, but Im having a difficult time figuring out how to go about solving it. As shown in the code below, I am loading 3 csv files and then processing them using queue.js. While this is happening, I want some type of progress indicator to be shown to the user.p  precodequeue   .deferd3.csv,data1.csv   .deferd3.csv,data2.csv   .deferd3.csv,data3.csv   .awaitAllpreprocessing codepre  pI have managed to get a progress bar to show up when the document is ready using JQuery. However, the progress bar pauses for the above code to execute, which defeats the whole point. The problem is not having a progress indicator or loading and processing data using a queue on their own rather, the problem is in integrating the two.  Im really stuck with  where to go from here.p  pAny help is much appreciated. I dont have to use queue.js, so suggestions for alternate ways to go about loading and processing are welcome if they make the solution easier. Thanksp

Negative 9 pIm writing a Python module that has only about twenty interesting types and global methods, but lots of constants and exceptions about 70 constants for locales, 60 constants for encodings, 20 formatting attributes, more than 200 exceptions, and so on. As a result codehelpcode on this module produces about 16,000 lines of text and is littered with nearly identical descriptions of each exception. The constants are not that demanding, but its still difficult to navigate them.p  pWhat would be a pythonic way to organize such a module Just leave it as is and rely on other documentation Move constants into separate dicts Into submodules Add them as classlevel constants, where appropriatep  pNote that this is a C extension so I cannot easily add a real submodule here. Ive heard that codesys.modulescode doesnt really check if the object there is a module, so one could add dictionaries there this way I could probably create codemymodule.localescode, codemymodule.encodingcode, and codemymodule.exceptionscode and add them into codesys.modulescode when my module is imported.

Negative 9 pI used to read files like thisp  precodef  [i.stripn for i in openfilename.txt] codepre  pwhich works just fine. I prefer this way because it is cleaner and shorter than traditional file reading code samples available on the web e.g. f  open... , for line in f.readlines , f.close.p  pHowever, I wonder if there can be any drawback for reading files like this, e.g. since I dont close the file, does Python interpreter handles this itself Is there anything I should be careful of using this approachp
Negative 9 pAs a personal challenge Im trying to implement the SIMON block cipher in Ruby. Im running into some issues finding the best way to work with the data. The full code related to this question is located at a hrefhttpsgithub.comRami114PersonalblobmasterSimonSimon.rb relnofollowhttpsgithub.comRami114PersonalblobmasterSimonSimon.rbap  pSIMON requires both XOR, shift and circular shift operations, the last of which is forcing me to work with BigNums so I can perform the left circular shift with math rather than a more complexslower double loop on byte arrays.p  pIs there a better way to convert a string to a BigNum and back again. p  pString  BigNum where N is 64 and pt is a string of plaintextp  precode pt  pt.chars.eachsliceN8.map x x.join.unpackb[0].toi2.toa codepre  pSo I break the string into individual characters, slice into Nsized arrays the word size in SIMON and unpack each set into a BigNum. That appears to work fine and I can convert it back.p  pNow my SIMON code is currently broken, but thats more the math I thinkhope and not the code. The conversion back is where ct is an array of bignums representing the ciphertextp  precodect.map  x [x.tos2.rjust128,0].packb .join codepre  pI seem to have to rightjustify pad the string as bignums are of undefined width so I have no leading 0s. Unfortunately the pack requires the defined with to have sensible output.p  pIs this a valid method of conversion Is there a better way Im not sure on either count and hoping someone here can help out.p  pE For torimus, the circular shift implementation Im using From link abovep  precodedef self.lcs bytes, blocksize, shift   bytes ltlt shift  bytes gtgt blocksize  shift amp 1ltlt blocksize1 end codepre

Is there really no better solution p  pIf not, why p  pEDIT I thought it would be easier without going in to speicifics, but the code Im actually working on is a hrefhttpsgithub.comtomchristiewebdriverplusblobmasterwebdriverplusinit.py relnofollowherea. The author of this module has written WebDriverMixin, which mostly provides some nicer syntax for accessing elements on the page that an instance of the selenium webdriver is on. I have SiteSpecificMixin, which provides some nicer syntax for accessing elements of the particular site that Im testing.p  pcodewebdriverplus.WebDrivercode returns instances of codewebdriverplus.Firefoxcode, codewebdriverplus.Chromecode, codewebdriverplus.Iecode, etc. codewebdriverplus.Firefoxcode inherits from codewebdriverplus.WebDriverMixincode and codeselenium.webdriver.firefox.webdriver.Firefoxcode, codewebdriverplus.Chromecode inherits from codewebdriverplus.WebDriverMixincode and codeselenium.webdriver.firefox.webdriver.Chromecode, etc. p  pI want to add functionality to the objects that codewebdriverplus.Webdrivercode returns, which seems like it requires making a class, codemysite.SiteSpecificDrivercode, copypasting the body of codewebdriverplus.WebDriver.newcode into codemysite.SiteSpecificDriver.newcode, and then writing codemysite.Firefoxcode which needs to inherit from codewebdriverplus.Firefoxcode and codemysite.SiteSpecificMixincode, codemysite.Chromecode which needs to inherit from codewebdriverplus.Chromecode and codemysite.SiteSpecificMixincode, etc, and rehandling all of the browsers inside my own module that the original author handles in his. p  pIm handling it now with code like in my example above, and it works. Im new to OOP, but my understanding of OO techniques is that theyre supposed to let you avoid code that has long ifelif...else clauses that depend on what type of object youre working with, so I think that I must be doing something wrong.p

I am creating a PHP website, and everything has been running smoothly until I decided to populate my database with some test data real data, which when the application starts being used for real, is going to be even bigger.

The structure of the database is done, the indexes are created, etc...

My question is how should I get the best balance between the number of joins amp the number or queries Because I feel like this could be really improved, but Im not sure how to achieve it.p  pMost of the tables will have the records count under 200, only the lessons table can have lots more.

I made a checkboard of 256 celles, with colors indexes 0 to 255 and a palette of levels of grey from 0x000000 to 0xFFFFFF. The code is given below.

Negative 9 pI simply want to check if all the letters that occur in a string are uppercase if they have lower and uppercase variants. Tcls builtin procs dont behave quite as desired, e.g.,p  precodestring is upper 123A codepre  preturns false, but I would want it to return true. I would also want it to return true if the A were replaced with, say, an uppercase Cyrillic letter, or a letter from another popular alphabet that doesnt have a case. I could simply filter out all nonletters from the string, but thats not so simple I think when youre trying to handle letters from languages other than just English.p
Negative 9 pIm new to unit testing and trying to learn the proper style. I like to setup the object that I am testing so that I can test it as if it were in use instead of only testing a newly constructed object. I cant test removing things from an object that is empty, as many objects are when constructed.p  pTake the following for an example where ObservedList is being tested and ListListener is a necessary class that is being mocked.p  precodepublic final class ObservedListTest    private ListListenerltIntegergt listener   private ObservedListltIntegergt list   BeforeMethod public void setup      listener  mockListListener.class     list  new ObservedListltIntegergtlistener     list.addAllArrays.asList1,2,3     resetlistener      Test public void addFirst      list.add0, 1     verifylistener.listEditedlist, 0, 1, Collections.ltIntegergtemptyList     verifyNoMoreInteractionslistener      Test void addAtEnd      list.add9     verifylistener.listEditedlist, 3, 4, Collections.ltIntegergtemptyList     verifyNoMoreInteractionslistener      Test void removeMiddle      list.removeInteger.valueOf2     verifylistener.listEditedlist, 1, 1, Collections.singletonList2     verifyNoMoreInteractionslistener     codepre  pAs a novice this seems to work well to me, but I know that its bad practice because it uses the coderesetcode method. I call coderesetcode because I dont want the actual tests to get confused due to interactions that happened in the setup.p  pThe javadoc for coderesetcode doesnt even get around to telling you what the method does because it is so busy telling you that you shouldnt use it. Ordinarily Id simply take that advice and avoid coderesetcode by removing my codesetupcode method and adjusting my tests to look more like thisp  precode  Test void removeMiddle      listener  mockListListener.class     list  new ObservedListltIntegergtlistener     list.addAllArrays.asList1,2,3     list.removeInteger.valueOf2     InOrder inOrder  inOrderlistener     inOrder.verifylistener.listEditedlist, 0, 3,       Collections.ltIntegergtemptyList     inOrder.verifylistener.listEditedlist, 1, 1,       Collections.singletonList2     verifyNoMoreInteractionslistener    codepre  pThis emalsoem seems to work well to me. The problem is that the documentation for the coderesetcode method saysp  blockquote   pInstead of reset please consider writing simple, small and focused   test methods over lengthy, overspecified tests.p blockquote  pI respect that Mockito is designed to encourage good style in unit tests and I want to learn from it, but Im having a hard time sorting out what message it is trying to send me. When I eliminate coderesetcode from my tests, my tests get emcomplexem, emlongerem and emless focusedem, so obviously Im doing it wrong.p  pWhat does doing it right look likep

Negative 9 pIve got an app that tracks vehicles and draws a polyline of their travel path on a map. I want to convert this polyline into a route using the directions service routing. This will allow me to be able to drag the path around and manipulate it etc. p  pThe problem is I cant think of a nice solution to this, and Im not sure if its possible. If I pass in the array of coordinates of the polyline to the directions service route it only draws a route using the start and the end of the polyline, it doesnt take into consideration any of the coordinates in between.p  pI tried to generate a waypoints array using the polyline coordinates array by evenly dividing it and getting 8 coordinates in between and passing those in as the waypoints but it fails to render at all now. If I test the code using a coordinates array that was generated by drawing a route it works though, so I know the code is working. Im presuming it fails because some of these coordinates may be slightly off the road its a polyline drawn from GPS positioning, so its not 100 accurate, and Google doesnt just snap it to the nearest accepted location.p  pCan anyone think of a solution to thisp  pHeres code examples to make it a bit clearerp  precode In the polyline app var encodedpath  google.maps.geometry.encoding.encodePathcoordinatearray     In the route app var coordinates  google.maps.geometry.encoding.decodePathencodedpath  var waypoints  []   Evenly get coordinates across the entire array to be used as waypoints for var i  1 i lt 8 i     var index  Math.floorcoordinates.length10  i     if index gt coordinates.length  1       break     waypoints.push       location new google.maps.LatLngcoordinates[index].lat, coordinates[index].lng,       stopover false       var request      origin coordinates[0],    destination coordinates[coordinates.length  1],    travelMode google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING,    waypoints waypoints   MapService.directionsService.routerequest, functionresponse, status     if status  google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK        MapService.directionsDisplay.setDirectionsresponse      codepre

Negative 9 pI had some javascript that basically listened for the paste event on a particular input text element. I did this event binding via jQuery. Now, in previous versions of IE, things worked great.p  pBut after upgrading to IE11, the behavior is different.p  pScenario Im copying and pasting multiple keywords separated by a CR and LF multiple rows in a spreadsheet.

Again, this worked great in previous versions of IE.p  pThe behavior in IE11 is as follows Upon pasting, the paste event handler does get called and everything that I mentioned does happen. Unfortunately, the pasted result in the input element is still not formatted correctly. Subsequent pasting does show the correct commadelimited string because the last thing i do in the handler is set the converted string to the clipboard.p  pQuestion strongAm i handling this paste event handler incorrectlystrong  Again, Im handling the paste event, converting the clipboard data, then setting the converted data back to the clipboard.

Negative 9 pI am trying to get the distinct count for a projection property on google app engine high replication datastore.

Ive seen posts that this cannot be done on GAE.  Well, this is very weird for me becasue if I use only one p  precodeHit.pageID  ltpageidgt  codepre  pstatement in the query above, it works fine, it doesnt count duplicate sessionIds as is expected. So, I dont understand why it returns incorrect result in my case.p  pAny comments, ideas are welcome..p

Negative 9 pMy overall goal is to produce an SSRS 2012 report which displays metrics about workers in different teams. Additionally, I would like to have some custom dropdown customizable per team where only particular workers are displayed. p  pFor example, I have 2 Projects  Project1 and Project2. Project1 wants dropdown choices which allow them to show their workers in San Francisco and New York teams. Project2 wants a dropdown that allows them to show workers in Houston and San Francisco teams. p  pTeams are not a construct represented by data in the database. I also want to arbitrarily define custom Teams in the future Team that works from home, Team that knows C, etc... The All team means no filtering. p  pThe query for a project would bep  precodeselect Member.MemberName, Member.MemberWork from Member where Member.ProjectProject1 codepre  pFor Project1, San Francisco team, I would write p  precodeselect Member.MemberName, Member.MemberWork from Member where Member.ProjectProject1 and Member.MemberID IN 123, 125, 127  teams are not stored in the database so I need to hardcode member IDs that compose a team  codepre  pThe way I am storing the relationship between each custom dropdown choice is as followsp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[TeamQueries] [ProjectName] [nchar]128 NULL, [TeamName] [nchar]64 NULL,[TeamQuery] [nchar]3096 NULL  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pExample Rows in this table would be in this image which I cannot post from lack of reputationp  pThe query the dataset is called data in the SSRS report is as followsp  precode declare query nvarcharmax     set query select Member.MemberName, Member.MemberWork from Member where Member.ProjectName  ProjectDropdown   and Member.MemberID IN   TeamQuery       execquery codepre  pThe codeProjectDropdowncode is a single valued codeTEXTcode parameter with default and available values coming from a query p  pcodeselect ProjectName from Projectscodep  pThe codeTeamQuerycode is also a single valued codeTEXTcode parameter with default and available values coming from a query p  precodeSELECT TeamName  ,TeamQuery FROM TeamQueries   WHERE ProjectNameProjectDropdown or ProjectName  All codepre  pChoosing Team1 and San Francisco in the available dropdowns, the error message I get is p  blockquote   pQuery execution failed for dataset data. Incorrect syntax near   127.p blockquote  pThe dropdowns get populated fine. By choosing Project1, I get choices of San Francisco and New York in the dropdown. p  pMy question is  whats wrong, how do I get this to work The general issue is I want a where predicate string that is part of an IN clause to come from the database and be optionally applied in SSRS.p  pHere are some things I have tried.p  ul liI tried to make this construct work outside of dynamic SQL. for example, using an OR construct to avoid the codeselect Member.MemberID from Membercode and have the followingli ul  pcodeselect Member.MemberName, Member.MemberWork from Member where member.ProjectNameProjectDropdown and TeamQuery IS NULL OR Member.MemberID IN TeamQuerycodep  pI kept getting codeVARCHARcode to int conversion errors.

Negative 9 pIm facing a problem with pygame 1.9.2 based on SDL 1.2.15 the only mean of resizing window programmatically I see is codepygame.display.setmode...code. But when I call this method my keyboard state is reset, so all currently pressed keys and modifiers send codeKEYUPcode event, repeated keys are stopped too.p  pWhen the window is resized manually by user keyboard state is perfectly normal. The event queue is paused for the time of resizing, then codeVIDEORESIZEcode and codeVIDEOEXPOSEcode events come up and keys are still pressed, if they were so.p  pThere are few questionsp  ol liIs there a way to keep normal keyboard state while resizing windowli liIf not, I would like to at least keep modifier keys but I can not just use codekey.setmodscode because I am unable to get the moment when user releases key.li liAt last is there a way to invoke resizing of SDL window directlyli ol  pExample program demonstrates undesired behaviour. Left and right arrows resize window to emsameem size, yet if they are pressed, there is only one keypress. Other keys are repeated normally if held. Output is event log for everything that happens.p  precodeimport pygame import sys   same size all the time size  200, 200  pygame.init pygame.display.setmodesize, pygame.RESIZABLE   if left or right arrow key is held nothing will happen despite this line pygame.key.setrepeat500, 200  run  True while run     for event in pygame.event.get         out  stsevent.type, strevent.dict         if event.type  pygame.QUIT             pygame.display.quit             run  False         if event.type  pygame.KEYDOWN              mods are also reset on setmode call             out  , mods  i  pygame.key.getmods             if event.key  pygame.KLEFT                 pygame.display.setmodesize, pygame.RESIZABLE             if event.key  pygame.KRIGHT                 pygame.display.setmodesize, pygame.RESIZABLE          printout      pygame.time.Clock.tick60 codepre  pTested on Win machine but soon will report if linux fails too.p  pUPD Ive been digging into source of pygame and can not see why, but the documentation bundled with sources of pygame states, that codePygame can only have a single display active at any time. Creating a new one with pygame.display.setmode will close the previous displaycode which implies that there is no way to emresizeem window, only to emrecreateem it. Seems a little strange to me.p  pUPD I have changed my progam behaviour so that resize does not actually happen until user releases keyboard completely. It works well and does not break usability.p  pNevertheless, it would be great to know if there exists a solution to stated problem.p

Is there any way I can save 2 versions of the videohigh quality and low quality, one saved at appfoldervideoname.mov, then the other at appfoldervideonameSD.mov Or save the HD video but have an SD version somehow All solutions are welcome, not just saving an SD version.

Negative 9 pI am struggling to actually implement the classifying part of my investigations into the possibility of classifying music according to some features of music files.p  pWhat I have currently produced is code that reads a table of features from the DB and then puts it back into the DB in another table. p  pThe problem is that I do not know how to work with the instances type. Documentation is crap  I have no clue what to do. p  pWhat I want to do I want to use a given set of music files and compute their feature vectors.

Negative 9 pI am writing a module in my program that needs to have configured settings to run. My client has asked the settings to be strongglobalstrong, companywide. Which means that the settings need a central location all the settings are codeintcode.p  pWe do have a database storing other data, so my first idea is to just create a table on the database. But this would either involve a strictly 1row table with very specific preset columns or a twocolumn table with each row being the setting identifier.p  pBasically, with my current approach, the table would either look like thisp  precodeSettings Table   setting1 int  setting2 int  setting3 int                440               7                 0   codepre  por like thisp  precodeSettings Table   setting varchar        value int           setting1                 440          setting2                   7          setting3                   0   codepre  pAlthough databases are certainly capable of doing this, in my opinion this really seems to fall outside of what databases were intended to do.

Negative 9 pIm trying to link together a set of disjoint maven projects into a standard multi module project. p  pThe interesting thing is that the modules are currently not arranged in a natural heirarchy. If I link together with a parent pom, then the reactor wont start up until I add coderelativePathscode to the parent stanza in the child pom XML files. p  pIf the GAV details are correct in the parent version vs the child, and the child modules are all linked in the parent pom  shouldnt this be enoughp  pin simple terms  for a nonstandard directory structure, is the coderelativePathcode strictly necessary for a multi module maven projectp  pThanks, Acep

The conference rooms all had large tables, whether heavy varnished oak or cheap plywood. The chairs were the sort that let you lean back with increasing tension, and they had a few levers underneath the seat that raise and lower the seat and adjust the back. Iu2019m a fidgeter, so I played with them a lot during meetings.nWe were mostly white, and all men. Each of us had between three and six u201Cdirect reportsu201D nonmanager programmers who we oversaw. We were the direct reports of our manager. There were lots and lots of managers at Microsoftu2014it was the only path to advancement, so the company structure became more and more steeply vertical. Once or twice a year, we would all get together and decide how good each of our reports was, by ordering them from best to worst.nThe system was called the stack rank.nFollowing Fridayu2019s news of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmeru2019s imminent retirement, postmortems of his lackluster 13year reign have pointed to stack ranking u2014which, to be entirely fair, predated himu2014as both a cause and a symptom of the corporationu2019s decline. As a software developer and later development lead at Microsoft between 1998u20132003, I had to evaluate others and be evaluated myself under this system. And I can say that yes, stack ranking is as toxic for innovation and integrity and morale as media reports made it out to be , and then some.nEach reportu2019s name was written on an index card and put on the table. It was a twostep process. First, reports were broadly sorted into four buckets excellent, good, mediocre, and awful. Then, within each bucket, people were paired for comparison and bubbled up or down. Managers would argue whether a particular report was better or worse than some other manageru2019s report in the same bucket. Our manager would adjudicate the debates. Some managers were better fighters than others.nA manageru2019s goals here are twofold. First, you want to place your best people as high as possible on the ladder. This will help them get big bonuses, promotions, and raises, and thus keep them happy and less likely to leave your group or the company. Second, if youu2019re unfortunate enough to have weak reports, you want either to help them by placing them sufficiently high that they donu2019t get dinged too badly come the annual review, or to throw them to the wolves and let them get ranked low. If you give up on them, theyu2019ll be put on a deadend track that marks them as more or less useless. The object is to get them out from under you and make them someone elseu2019s problem.nI was lucky not to have any weak reports. I had been encouraged to take one at an earlier point, but frenetically talked my way out of it, using all the managerese I could summon to argue that he didnu2019t belong on my team.nMy reports seemingly did fine. I got them all into the top two buckets. After the stack rank was over, our boss, whou2019d overseen the whole meeting, took our stack rank and then went to another, similar meeting one level up, where now we would be stacked and ranked behind our backs, then mixed in with the stack weu2019d just created, cruelly shuffled like a deck of human cards.nEventually, the vice presidents would have to bargain among themselves for how many bonuses and raises they would get for their entire organizations, then ration them out according to the stack rank. People would then be assigned one of three grades 4.0 Above Average, 3.5 Average, and 3.0 Below Average. The very rare 4.5 got you a set of steak knives  a 2.5 meant you were fired more or less. Iu2019m not sure if Alan Turing himself could have gotten a 5.0.nThe stack rank was harmful. It served as an incentive not to join highquality groups, because youu2019d be that much more likely to fall low in the stack rank. Better to join a weak group where youu2019d be the star, and then coast. Maybe the executives thought this would help strong people lift up weak teams. It never worked that way. More often, it just encouraged people to backstab their coworkers, since their loss entailed your profit.nThe stack rank was a zerosum gameu2014one person could only excel by the amount that others were penalized. And it was applied at every level of the organization. Even if you were in a group of three high performers, it was very likely that one of you would be graded Above Average, one Average, and one Below Average. Unless your manager was a prick or an idiot or both, the ordering would reflect your relative skills, but that never came as too much comfort to the hardworking schlub who just wasnu2019t as good as the other two.nThis was my problem. I had three reports, A, B, and C, and they neatly fit into three categories C was good, B was great, and A was fantastic. They were all nice and retiring sortsu2014they werenu2019t selfpromoters, which put them at a disadvantage at Microsoftu2014and I did want to do well by them. Based on their position in the stack rank, I thought that this would have been a fair assessment of them relative to the company in generalnMy Ideal DistributionnA Above AveragenB Above AveragenC AveragenAbove Average would get A and B nice bonuses and raises, while C might get a small raise and a decent bonus with an Average. That didnu2019t happen. My manager told me baldly that this was how it would gonThe Actual DistributionnA Above averagenB AveragenC Below averagenMy desired rankings were out of the question, since my manager would then have had to steal that extra Above Average from some other manager. I thought that B could live with Average we were all wellcompensated, after all, but rating C as Below Average hurt.nSo I argued for C, and my manager said there was exactly one alternativenThe Alternative DistributionnA AveragenB AveragenC AveragenBut A had been at the very top of the stack How could A do worse than people weu2019d all agreed were weaker programmers I gave up and let C take the Below Average. This is the zerosum game at work.nI still feel bad about this.nThen I had to explain things to my reports. This illustrated another problem with the system It destroyed trust between individual contributors and management, because the stack rank required that all lowerlevel managers systematically lie to their reports. Why Because for years Microsoft did not admit the existence of the stack rank to nonmanagers . Knowledge of the process gradually leaked out, becoming a recurrent complaint on the muchloathed by Microsoft MiniMicrosoft blog , where a highup Microsoft manager bitterly complained about organizational dysfunction and was joined in by a chorus of hundreds of employees. The stack rank finally made it into a Vanity Fair article in 2012, but for many years it was not common knowledge, inside or outside Microsoft. It was presented to the individual contributors as a system of objective assessment of u201Ccore competencies,u201D with each person being judged in isolation.nWhen review time came, and programmers would fill out a short selfassessment talking about their achievements, strengths, and weaknesses, only some of them knew that their ratings had been more or less already foreordained at the stack rank. The ones who knew could sometimes be recognized by their flip comments on their performance reviews, like the hottempered guy who wrote every year in u201CAreas to Improve,u201D u201CI will try to be less of an asshole.u201DnThey were exceptions, though. If you did know about the stack rank, you werenu2019t supposed to admit it. So you went through the pageantry of the performance review anyway, arguing with your manager in the rhetoric of u201Ccore competencies.u201D The managers would respond in kind. Since the managers had little control over the actual score and attendant bonus and raise if any, their job was to write a review to justify the stack rank in the language of absolute merit. u201CHigher visibilityu201D was always a good catchall Sure, you may be a great coder and work 80 hours a week, but not enough people have heard of younStrangely, this charade would sometimes happen even between managers and their managers, both pretending that they didnu2019t know about the stack rank that they had recently participated in. This kind of bad faith is more common than you might think. I saw it most vividly in a certain number of partyliners who seemed wholly oblivious to the dissonance between the performance review and the stack rank, as though the two would always magically line up, even though they never did.nThis sort of organizational dissembling skews your psyche. After I left Microsoft, I was left with lingering paranoia for months, always wondering about the agendas of those around me, skeptical that what I was being told was the real story. I didnu2019t realize until the nonstacked performance review time at my new job that Iu2019d become so wary. At the timeu2014inside Microsoftu2014it just seemed the only logical way to be.,datecreatedMon, 20 Jan 2014 180203 PST,categoriesentertainmentculture0.014285714285714284,hospitalityrecreation0.03428571428571428,other0.0,businessfinance0.5157142857142857,technologyinternet0.05999695366444171,socialissues0.022857142857142854,sports0.04052786085981821,humaninterest0.03714285714285714,religionbelief0.039999999999999994,warconflict0.022259647554023695,education0.011428571428571427,healthmedicalpharma0.031428571428571424,labor0.028571428571428567,lawcrime0.023333333333333327,politics0.01714285714285714,environment0.039596490302668735,weather0.00857142857142857,disasteraccident0.052857142857142846,supertags[id501672,positions[[92,100],[155,162],[647,654],[684,692],[1795,1803],[1921,1928],[1964,1972]],scopebaseball,nameManager baseball,score0.7,contentMatch0.47236180904522607,categories22299804Baseball strategy,17908961Sports coaches,846062Baseball managers,2280640Baseball coaches,9697509Baseball occupations,type1,senseRank1,variety0.7574257425742574,depth0.6470588235294117,id337689,positions[[1950,1957]],nameDebate,score0.6,contentMatch0.8994974874371859,categories698270Debating,type1,senseRank1,variety0.5891089108910892,depth0.6470588235294117,id4692150,positions[[632,639],[887,894],[1479,1486],[1626,1633],[1837,1843],[1890,1896],[2308,2315],[2717,2724],[2909,2916]],nameReport,score0.6,contentMatch0.7135678391959799,categories1222842Technical communication,694072Documents,type1,senseRank1,variety0.7623762376237624,depth0.7058823529411764,id30873450,positions[[12,19]],nameDeposit account,score0.6,contentMatch0.7135678391959799,categories38182585Banking terms,type1,senseRank2,variety0.8415841584158416,depth0.6470588235294117],typearticle,cid1350985132,urlhttpmobile.slate.comarticlesbusinessmoneybox201308microsoftceosteveballmerretiresafirsthandaccountofthecompanys.single.htmloriginalreferrerhttpt.coyOO5N2OQxZn,methodGET,code200,relativeurlapiarticletoken...ampfieldstext,title,urlampfieldstext,title,urlampurlhttpmobile.slate.comarticlesbusinessmoneybox201308microsoftceosteveballmerretiresafirsthandaccountofthecompanys.single.htmloriginalreferrerhttp3A2F2Ft.co2FyOO5N2OQxZamputmcampaignBufferamputmcontentbuffer47791amputmmediumtwitteramputmsourcebuffer headers[namenull,valueHTTP1.1 200 OK,nameVary,valueAcceptEncoding,nameDate,valueTue, 21 Jan 2014 024346 GMT,nameContentLength,value7934,nameContentType,valueapplicationjson,nameServer,valueApacheCoyote1.1],bodyiconhttpcdn.macrumors.comimagesnewappletouchicon.png,textApple debuted a new television ad for the iPad during the NFL playoffs this weekend.

Negative 9 pIm making a web application which will only allow registered members to download zip folders from a folders directory. p  pI really need  to know which would be the proper way to secure the folder as only members stored in my database will be able to access them so the problem is if somebody finds the directory and a file name theres nothing to stop them accessing it.p  pIve been doing some research and found some approaches but they all have major drawbacks.p  p1. put the files outside of the webroot then use readfile to send them the data.br This is how I have it currently set up. the major draw back is that Im on a shared server and max execution time for the script is 30 seconds cant be changed and if the file is big or user connection slow the timeout will be called before the download is complete.p  p2. htaccess and htpasswd inside a webroot directory.p  pThe problem with this is I dont want to have to ask the user to put a password again. unless theres a way to allow php to send the password then send a header to the actual zip file that needs to be downloaded. p  p3. Keeping the files in webroot but obfuscating the file names so they are hard to guess.p  pthis is just totally lamep  pWhat I really would like to do is keep the files outside of web root then just send a headerlocation to that document to force a download, obviously as its not in web root so the browser wont see it. is there a way around this. Is there a way to redirect to an out of web root file with  headerlocationfile to force a download. thus allowing apache to serve the file and not php with readfile.  p  pIs there some easier way to secure the folders and serve with apache that I am just not coming across Has anybody experienced this problem before and is there an industry standard way to do this betterp  pI know this may resemble a repeat question but none of the answers in the other similar question gave any useful information for my needs.p
Negative 9 pToday I ported XE5 installation onto the VMWare Windows 7 x86 OS. I did not install android SDKs, but rather created one from already existing SDK on my host OS, via Network Drive mapping.p  pThe network drive S on VMWare OS is basically the clone link to my physical hard drive C of the host OS, so the paths should be ok. The SDK was created successfully, however I get some a lot, probably all there is linker errors when trying to compile.p  pIm opening existing projects from S drive as well, practically the same as I did on my host OS before. I can run Sample project, FlashLight for example, either from VM C disk, or the same, S disk location with no linker errors, so Im guessing its something in my project.p  pCan anybody tell why Rad XE5 has undefined reference error E2597, and how could I bypass thisp  pError log belowp  precode [DCC Error] E2597 SUsersPublicDocumentsRAD

Negative 9 pI need to import several files to a library each month and thought I would make it simple by creating a .csv with all of the file information path, name, worksheet, type and use a macro to loop through and bring in the information however it doesnt like it when I pass it a macro variable.

Ive looked around and saw that the macros are compiled differently than the proc statements but I refuse to believe that I have to write out 30 proc import statements just to get these files in.  Itd be much easier to manage from a .csv.  Please take a look and offer your advice.

Negative 9 pSo I have this navigation which looks good on both mobile and Desktop because it resizes well and accordingly, but I cant get any content after that to go immeadiately below.

Setting the paddingtop property makes the page rendering in mobile very different to desktop.

Negative 9 pI have to admit this has always confused me how certain windows API accept strings. Take for example a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms63354628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowSetWindowTexta. Now any function which takes a pointer to anything typically means it doesnt store that object but merely use the pointer that is passed. Therefore the caller has the responsibility to make sure the object passed to it exist for whenever it may be needed. Now what would you expect the final message that will be printed out belowp  precodeTCHAR  label  new TCHAR[50] tcscpy label, Tallocated string  mwndStaticLabel.SetWindowText label  tcscpy label, Tstring has changed  codepre  pTheoretically I would expect it to print string has changed but it prints allocated string. Similarlyp  precodeCString label  TCString Label mwndStaticLabel.SetWindowText label  codepre  pIn this case a pointer of a local variable label is being passed to it but still no problem. The control always prints the right string even though it received pointer of string allocated on stack. p  pThis implies that the control actually allocate its own memory and assign that to the control instead of the pointer we are passing but this fact is never documented. Isnt this a little misleading When I am passing a pointer to a function, one thing I immediately remind myself is I shouldnt be destroying it until the function returns but it is not the case in this case and it is not documented either.p  pSo my question ultimately is this simply lack of documentation or there is something else to it  when we passing a pointer to an object but it essentially behaves like we have passed object by valuep

Negative 9 pis there a simple way of having the datatable search filter to only hide elements that dont match the performed search and not remove them from the dom p  pI am allowing users to perform searches even when other data is being loaded by ajax, which looks for the dom element to put the data inside it. With the default behaviour though, insert fails as the dom element doesnt exist anymore.p  pTo be a little more specific I am fetching data and putting it into a datatable, each row gets an id. Afterwards, I do ajax asynchronous calls to multiple servers that return values which should go in columns of a row with the correspondent id. This all works fine, unless you start searching before this new set of data has been inserted when the ajax call completes its task, it cannot find the row to append the data it retrieved, as the row has been removed from the dom.p  pThank you very much for any helpp

Negative 9 pIm trying to find the most efficient way to manage timestamps in a SQL database, which I am communicating with via PHP, and ultimately printing data in ObjectiveC and Java.p  pThis is basically a twopart question, but they are relatedp  p1 I know using codeNSDateFormattercode is rather simple, but quite expensive. Im wondering the most efficient way to go about keep track, parsing, and printing this data in a userfriendly format like so 5 days left on your timer. Should I make conversions in PHP, objectiveC, or not use timestamps at all and use normal ints in the databasep  pFor clarificationexample, lets say from my app, I set a timer, and I want to keep track of that time in my database and a week from now,br 2 I want to alert from codeSQLgtPHPgtObjectiveC that said timer is now completeovercode.p  pThis is not what I will be doing in practice, but understanding how to most efficiently do this would be sufficient for me to do what I want to do.

Negative 9 pIm trying to create a batch file that will execute all of the batch files located in a folder.  So I have a folder that contains 6 will increase batch files, and I want to use a for loop to iterate through the list.  An easier way of understanding it would be like sop  precodefor batchFile in folder   CALL batchFile   cd Desktop codepre  pEach batch file should start after the other finishes.  Also, batch files will be the only type of files in the folder, so there shouldnt need to be any kind of separation.  It may sound odd, but both the call and the directory change need to be inside of the loop due to directory changes in each of the batch files. This is the closest thing Ive found for getting a start on thisp  precode for r i in DIR do CALL codepre  pWhere DIR is the folder directory.  However, it 1 doesnt work and 2 would only do a CALL and not also a directory change.  Does anyone know how to do thisp  pAlso, Im using Windows 7.p  pThanks.p  pEXTENSIONp  pDoing this in a bat file will workp  precodeCALL WelcomeScreenLists.bat cd directory CALL WelcomeScreenLinks.bat cd directory CALL RightClick.bat cd directory CALL RibbonButtons.bat cd directory pause codepre  pdirectory is the full path of the folder containing the bat files.  I would like to turn this into a for loop that loops through all files in the folder.p

Negative 9 pstrongThe Backstorystrongbr Im writing a Rails engine that provides an API for advanced search and reporting capabilities against the apps models. Currently the engine has a hardcoded list of model classes. It then pulls every single column out of those models using codemodel.columnscode etc. and makes them searchable and displayable through the searchingreporting UI. The search query a a hrefhttpsgithub.comactiverecordhackeryransack relnofollowRansacka hash is created by the user through the UI.p  pI need a way to define which modelscolumns are searchable and which arent eg. letting users search and create reports using the password digest column would be a bad idea. The engine needs to be able to to read the configuration data and restrict certain modelscolumns from even showing up in the UI.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongbr Whats the right way to have classes in Rails provide configuration information to a separate classmoduleservicep  pstrongThe Complicationstrongbr strong1strong It seemed at first like I could just include a module into the models and use a method at the class level to do the configuration, like sop  precodeclass TheModel lt ActiveRecordBase   include TheMixin    searchablecolumns id, firstname, lastname codepre  pThe problem with this approach, however, is that in the development environment Rails lazyloads classes and thus the configuration information wouldnt get registered with codeTheMixincode unless codeTheModelcode is required for some reason. Although it would still work in the production environment developing the Engine or any app that uses it would be a headache. This makes me wonder if defining the information through methods run at class definition is a code smell.p  pSo due to Rails lazyloading the configuration information needs to be present before the search service is first run. Hardcoding the information into the service is not an option since its an Engine, so what other options are left p  pstrong2strong One option would be putting the information into an initializer, but that seems like a code smell as well. I dont want to have the configuration so far decoupled from the classes themselves because that seems like a maintenance issue. It also seems like the configuration information should be a concern of the model and therefore handled by the model class rather than some initializer.p  pstrong3strong The last option I see is making the information available on the model itself such as in the form of a methodp  precodedef searchconfig    columns [id, firstname, lastname]  end codepre  pand then in the service, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma107128383341111getting a list of all the modelsa and looping through them to get the configurations. But then this also feels like a code smell. It requires writing code specifically for the development environment codeRails.application.eagerloadcode, forces eager loading, and feels like it could easily be broken by edge cases. Furthermore, at this point weve already forced all of the models to load, so why not just use the first mixinstyle option and just use codeRails.application.eagerloadcode on its own That would trigger the classlevel methods and get us our configuration.p  pstrongEDITstrong Its also occurred to me that defining configuration at initialization time is a bad idea. What if the user should be able to search the codeUserscode table if theyre an admin but not if theyre a standard user This wouldnt be possible if configuration was defined at initialization time. It seems like the best option would be if the models could register themselves with the search service at initialization time but then the search service would query each registered module for configuration information each time it runs, allowing the models to define conditional configurations. Of course, theres still the problem of eager loading and the development environment...p

Negative 9 pWeve got several services that, in development, are set to run using Local IIS. In the web.config of each service project is, among other things, the endpoint for the service. This works both in development and in production.p  pYesterday I setup the development environment on my laptop, but I am having a very odd issue with the services. I get a 400 error when I try to navigate my browser to any of them, and I tried a number of things to get them to work but ultimately I found that if I deleted the endpoint from the web.config then they would work. This is quite the opposite of how it is on my desktop and on other developers machines where the endpoint has to be present for the service to run.p  pThis makes absolutely no sense to me, and at this point the only difference I know of is that my laptop is running on Windows 7 whereas all the other machines are on Windows 8.p  pCan anyone explain how a service will only work when the endpoint is defined on one pc, but on another pc it will only work when the endpoint is not defined Definitely baffled by this one.p  pEDIT p  pOn my local development machine specifically, my laptop with Windows 7 I have taken everything out of the web.config but what is essential to making the webpage that says You have created a service. To test this service ... etc. come up successfully.

And the serviceMetadata tag allow me to navigate to the service using a web browser and see the You created a service. page but otherwise wouldnt be necessary to actually use the service. So without those two things there would actually be nothing in the web.config at all. I dont understand how its possible that this service comes up when I navigate to it though when there are no end points defined anywherep

Negative 9 pYeah, so Im having difficulty trying to read a file with multiple lines of just numbers a mix of floats and integers on each line.  I have a .txt file, and from there Im trying to scan those lines, and identify if the second float is bigger than the first float, and make a decision based on the result.  So far, it works, but the problem is that I am not able to get to the second or third line, as the program just stops after the first line.p  pHeres a sample of the .txt filep  precode 9.64 6.30 3  2.77 3.98 10  5.63 4.20 5  0.00 0.00 0 codepre  pWhen the scanf hits 0 for all values, it breaks out of the loops and stops the program.  Also, I dont necessarily know how many lines there are in the file, but I do know that for every line there will be two floats and 1 integer in that order.p  pNow with these numbers, Im trying to compare the float values to determine something, and then use the integer and the floats to compute an answer which will then be printed onto a separate .txt file.p  pHeres a sample code I made that follows the same structure as the one Im working on by the way, I have looked at getf function and arrays but Im pretty much a bigginer, so Im still confused about howwhere to use them.p  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt includeltmath.hgt  int main void      int amount, x     float first, second, currentvalue, totalpositive, totalnegative     FILE fin  fopennumbersin.txt, r     FILE fout  fopenresultout.txt, w      x1     amount0     totalpositive0     totalnegatve0      whilex1              fscanffin, f f d, ampfirst, ampsecond, ampamount         ifsecondfirst gt 0                      currentvalueamountfirstsecond             totalpositivetotalpositivecurrentvalue             fprintffout, 0.2f 0.2f dincrease  0.2f, total increase  0.2f, first, second, amount, currentvalue, totalpositive                  else ifsecondfirst lt 0                      currentvalueamountfirstsecond             totalnegativetotalnegativecurrentvalue             fprintffout, 0.2f 0.2f ddecrease  0.2f, total decrease  0.2f, first, second, amount, currentvalue, totalnegative                  elsefirst0ampampsecond0ampampamount0                      break                    fclosefin     fclosefout     systemnotepad resultout.txt     systempause     return 0  codepre
Negative 9 pIve been struggling for a while with this issue. In some code Im writing I need to write a bunch of files and optionally create the directory tree if needed. My idea is as follows catch exception IOError and if its first argument is ENOENT then create the directory structure and attempt to write the file again.p  pI have written a relatively small retry function but Id like to generalize it to any code that might throw an exception. It all worked until I came upon something like thisp  precodedef retryf     def wrapperargs, kwargs         try             return fargs, kwargs         except             print Gotcha here     return wrapper  def updatefile, value     contextmanager     retry     def safeopenfile, mode         with openfile, mode as f             yield f     try         with safeopenfile, w as f             f.writevalue     except         print Gotcha there  update testsnonexistingdummy.txt, Dummy line codepre  pIve tightened the code to the minimum to show what fails when codeopencode throws an exception. In this code the exception is caught only from the except block in codeupdatecode, not in codewrappercode so I always get codeGotcha therecode although I expected codeGotcha herecode instead. Ive tried swapping the decorator and contextmanager lines, no way. I have checked and made sure the wrapper gets called it does. Just that it catches no exception from codefcode.p  pWhat am I doing wrongp

Negative 9 pNote I apologize if there are similar questions, but they are more specific like UIMapView Kit Memory Leak issues, I am more concerned and really want to know in General Swift and ARC and the memory Management Issues with it. p  pI have done a couple of apps now in Xcode, however it was all done in ObjectiveC.p  pThe memory management of UIKit objectsincluding UIViews and UIViewControllers and any other object for that matter was easy to handle in ObjectiveC, and by easy I mean getting used to it  after battling with it at some point in the Learning curve. p  pNow I am working with Swift trying to keep up with the CuttingEdge technology. however I have noticed a slight issue with what I was able to pin down and control in ObjectiveC, Memory Management. p  pSwift comes in saying how easy is going to be for us to focus more on Code Development and not on memory management like its predecessor or soontobe predecessor. However I have not yet found this benefit. I have been having a horrible time with memory management of my new app. Just creating a simple UIViewController with a few views can stack up memory that I dont longer need, few Mbs at a time. p  pkeep in mind, I have been using deconstructorDeinit in Swift, been assigning nil to values I no longer need to use, removing SubViews from Super Views manually thinking this was the problem, even using AutoReleasePool code segment. p  precodeautoreleasepool Code looping through Swift Native Objects that potentially might lead to leaking  But AutoReleasePool helps with this, supposedly.  codepre  pNow the Question Anyone here would know exactly what is the problem Is it me doing something terrible with my code or is there really a bug in Xcode and swift memory management Have anyone else had this issue, have you solved it p  pHere is a link explaining a bit this situation.  a hrefhttpdigitalleaves.comblog201407memorymanagementinswiftalostopportunity relnofollowProblems of ARC in Swifta  a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationswiftconceptualswiftprogramminglanguageAutomaticReferenceCounting.html relnofollowARC in Swift Apple Docsap  hr  pUpdate p  pYou are right, I should post more about my situation so here it goes.p  pI have memory starting at 5mb as as soon as the app starts.p  pOnce I start navigating around the app. I notice how memory starts to pile up little by little. but the biggest spike of memory start to pile up when I use UIMapView of about 25 Mbs. p  pwhen using just a regular UITableViewController it just piles up 2mbs every time I pushto NavController the same UITableViewController. When I tab that TableViewCell it opens another ViewController with a UIMapView, this is where the memory starts to pile up really good. p  pRememeber I am just going back and forth navigating through the app. Just a total of 4 UIViewControllers including My Menu. p  pBut here is the thing... All these memory SnapShots you see are after I stop navigating and go back to the main menu, the Root ViewController of my Navigation Controller. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSG25O.png altStarting App img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQprks.png altOpening UiTableViewController img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzJYdB.png altOpening ViewController with UIMapView img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOokj9.png altStacking that Memory Upp

Negative 9 pMy method, codeChomp.prototype.animatecode does not work properly. My code works when the function does not apply codeChomp.prototype.playerMovecode. p  pWhen codeChomp.prototype.playerMovecode is applied, then the if statement involving codecountercode before the addEventListener can sometimes execute the addEventListener, even if  codecountercode is greater than one, those times it executes the function in addEventListener many times, depending on how long the code was running before it was executed. Those times, it should not have executed the addEventListener, and if it did, then counter should be added to more than one, and then not executed again. Counter was added to more than one, even on these times of the addEventListener being executed multiple times.  p  pEven stranger, when I have codeChomp.prototype.animatecode always set codecountercode to 1 instead of 0, it will still execute the if statement that says codeif counter lt 1code once. Also, when codeChomp.prototype.playerMovecode is applied, then codeChomp.prototype.chompingcode does not work quite right. It does work without codeChomp.prototype.playerMovecode. This is very strange, and I do not understand the problem.p  pIf there is request for a certain part of my code, then I could post that, but my full code is probably not all useful to the question.p  precodevar counter  0 var rotation var Chomp  functionx, y    many properties  Chomp.prototype.chomping  function    properties and conditions, etc.  Chomp.prototype.animate  function    var that  this   Chomp.prototype.chomping.applythis   Chomp.prototype.playerMove.applythis   counter  1   counter  0   setTimeoutfunction     Chomp.prototype.animate.applythat   , 100  Chomp.prototype.playerMove  function    var that  this   values   var yNew  0, xNew  0, rotate     var once  functionevent      conditions for keys, etc.     Chomp.prototype.move.callthat, xNew, yNew, rotate     values     removeEventListenerkeydown, once      if counter lt 1     addEventListenerkeydown, once    more code    Chomp.prototype.move  functionxNew, yNew, rotate    var that  this   counter  1   loops, conditions, etc. var yellow  new Chomp30, 60 Chomp.prototype.animate.applyyellow codepre  pThanks ahead of time p

Negative 9 pI am absolutely confused about how permission groups in hdfs work, at least in my cluster. Lets say i have unix user kranach, that belongs to group bla. I have hadoop2 cluster setup from CDH5, there is unix group emhadoopem to which users hdfs, yarn and mapred belogns but not kranach, he has nothing to do with hadoop.p  pNow, my root directory in hdfs has permissions like followingp  pcodedrwxrxrx    hdfs supergroup          0 20150127 2308 codep  pSo, I am assuming that since me, kranach, does not belong to supergroup, i should not be allowed to create directories under . However when i do this code kranachczarnobog hdfs dfs mkdir bla kranachczarnobog hdfs dfs ls   Found 6 items drwxrxrx    kranach supergroup          0 20150127 2327 blacodep  pSo Ive just created directory, that belongs to me and group supergroup. But i am not in supergroup, and shouldnt be allowed to create dirs there in a first place According to hadoop documentation a hrefhttphadoop.apache.orgdocsr1.2.1hdfspermissionsguide.htmlConfigurationParameters relnofollowhttphadoop.apache.orgdocsr1.2.1hdfspermissionsguide.htmlConfigurationParametersa by default hadoop just checks linux user group command, which clearly for mine user doesnt show supergroup it doesnt even exist.p  pCould anyone please explain me this behaviour And tell how to prevent it i.e. I want to have on this box users, that are allowed to access hdfs, but cant write there anything.p

Negative 9 pWhen installing the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent on Windows SBS 2011 Standard I receive error code  Error  2145124329. When looking at the file OBManagedlog.LOGCurr.errlog located here CWindowsTemp extract below it appears to be failing on the Windows Powershell 3.0 prerequisite which is apart of the .NET 3 Framework. I have tried to install this manually but it does not appear to be compatible with SBS 2011 standard. Anyone have any ideas MS Azure cannot help until we have a paid subscription, I have only a trial at the moment as I wanted to test the product first but have been unable to do so as i cant install the agent. p  p11B8    1D70    0219   091103.004    10  PrereqPage.cs211          NORMAL  ltltlt Dialog  Prerequisite Check Page  Entering 11B8    1D70    0219   091103.007    10  PrereqPage.cs242

Negative 9 pI want to find surface normals for an image. I have 2 water surface images. First one is still water, and second one is a moving image.p  pI found each corrospondent pixels for both of images by using normalized correlation. therefore, I have displacement for all pixels in x and y direction.p  pwhat i am asking is how i can find the water surface normals for each point I think displacement in x and y direction can help me for finding surface normals, but I dont know how to move forward. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 9 pI am investigating performance hotspots in an application which spends 50 of its time in memmove3. The application inserts millions of 4byte integers into sorted arrays, and uses memmove to shift the data to the right in order to make space for the inserted value.p  pMy expectation was that copying memory is extremely fast, and I was surprised that so much time is spent in memmove. But then I had the idea that memmove is slow because its moving overlapping regions, which must be implemented in a tight loop, instead of copying large pages of memory. I wrote a small microbenchmark to find out whether there was a performance difference between memcpy and memmove, expecting memcpy to win hands down.p  pI ran my benchmark on two machines core i5, core i7 and saw that memmove is actually faster than memcpy, on the older core i7 even nearly twice as fast Now I am looking for explanations.p  pHere is my benchmark. It copies 100 mb with memcpy, and then moves about 100 mb with memmove source and destination are overlapping. Various distances for source and destination are tried. Each test is run 10 times, the average time is printed.p  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comcruppstahl78a57cdf937bca3d062chttpsgist.github.comcruppstahl78a57cdf937bca3d062cap  pHere are the results on the Core i5 Linux 3.5.054generic 81precise1Ubuntu SMP x8664 GNULinux, gcc is 4.6.3 UbuntuLinaro 4.6.31ubuntu5.

In worst case I would expect memcpy to be as fast as memmove.p  pPS I know that I cannot replace memmove with memcpy in my code. I know that the code sample mixes C and C. This question is really just for academic purposes.p  h2UPDATE 1h2  pI ran some variations of the tests, based on the various answers.p  ol liWhen running memcpy twice, then the second run is faster than the first one.li liWhen touching the destination buffer of memcpy codememsetb2, 0, BUFFERSIZE...code then the first run of memcpy is also faster.li limemcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove.li ol  pHere are the resultsp  precodememcpy        0.0118526 memcpy        0.0119105 memmove 002 0.0108151 memmove 004 0.0107122 memmove 008 0.0107262 memmove 016 0.0108555 memmove 032 0.0107171 memmove 064 0.0106437 memmove 128 0.0106648 codepre  pMy conclusion based on a comment from Oliver Charlesworth, the operating system has to commit physical memory as soon as the memcpy destination buffer is accessed for the very first time if someone knows how to proof this then please add an answer. In addition, as Mats Petersson said, memmove is cache friendlier than memcpy.p  pThanks for all the great answers and commentsp

Negative 9 pLet me come directly to use case.p  pI am having a number of workitems in my process say codeA,B,Ccode. It starts in codeAgtBgtCcode order.p  pIn my case, codeBcode is a call to a code3rd partycode web service. codeCcode should process only if codeBcode is success. if the call to the webservice fails, system should retry after code5 mincode. The number of retries are limited to code3code. p  pHow can I achieve this using codeJbpm6code.p  pSome options that I understand from doc are,p  p1 I can use a work item handler. Inside work item, I will start another thread which will do the retries and finally it calls the codecompleteWrokItemcode method. But in this case my process engine thread will wait unnecessarily for the  codecompleteWrokItemcode call. 2I can use codecommandcode for retry . But if I call codecommandcode it will execute in another thread and the process thread will execute codeCcode. Which is not a desirable wayp  pHow can I create a process so that, codeBcode will execute in backend and will notify the engine that it can continue executing codeCcodep  pPlease advice.p  pThanks in advance.p  pPlease comment if my question is not clear enough to answer.p

Negative 9 pWhy is there not an API for determining what socket options have actually been set security  But the local and remote end points are available anywayp  pAside from deriving the socket and manually storing the information how can one get all options in use on a socket without iterating over any possible option p  pDeriving is relevant, only because you can keep track of the information you need yourself such as the options size and if its a physically set option as well.p  pMy main question primarily though is as followsp  pAfter having the required information how can one easily determine which of those options are not going to take up space in the payload section defined by the MTUp  pMax Segment Size, Dont Fragment etc DO take up size in the payload which is described by the MTU, possibly contrary to popular beliefp  pI would like to know this information before performing a send or receive on the socket if possible. p  pPlease be as platform agnostic as possible,e.g. use only the Berkeley Socket API methods and not system calls.p  pExample programming language can be whatever you program in to be accepted. p  pemUPDATEemp  pHeres an existing question which uses lsof as a solution although its os specific a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1824115displaysocketoptionsDisplay socket optionsa. p  pUnfortunately it looks like I will have to research a bit to adopt this to Windows because im not sure such an analogous exists there, if not I might release pssockets to add to the useful pstools arsenal.p  pemUPDATEem a hrefhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201203ipprotocolheader relnofollowhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201203ipprotocolheaderap  pThat is the ip header and proves options can take up space and also that the header can be up to 60 bytes When using options 4 bit max is 15  4  60.p  pemUPDATEem The biggest problem with the existing solution above is that it WILL NOT display options In the IP header it will only display options which are present on the socket instance.p  pMy question specifically was to get the socket options which take up space in the ip header which the application doesnt have access to at the protocol level. p
Negative 9 pI have a subscription to an RSS feed via SuperFeedr, and have noticed a lot of duplicate notifications lately. Ive double checked my subscriptions via the web application, but I only see 1. I also looked into making sure that I am returning the correct response code. The documentation says that a 200 should be sent as the response, and the retry structure is after 5, 10, and 15 seconds, but in my logs, I see the duplicates being sent milliseconds apart, which leads me to believe that these are not retries.p  pThe very FIRST lines of my doPost method arep  precode    response.setStatusHttpServletResponse.SCOK     response.flushBuffer codepre  pThe attempt there is to let superfeedr know that I received the message, an ack essentially.p  pAs a short term remedy, I have decided to keep a record in the datastore that represents the most recent message. p  pI know that normally within the context of a servlet, you wouldnt synchronize on the servlet instance itself, because that would cause a queue of requests, but in this case, Superfeedr is the only service using this servlet, it isnt consumed by normal users, so that is exactly what I want, just wanted to make sure that there wouldnt be any ill side effects of this approach. p  pI want to allow time for a request to come in from Superfeedr, analyze the message, make sure its not a duplicate, and if its not, update the value in the datastore that represents the most recent message, one at a time.

Negative 9 pI am trying to replay an Apache access log per threaduser. What I would like to do is create multiple access log files for each user session and then give each thread a different log file to replay.p  pI set up user authentication with CSV config file and each thread gets assigned a user from that file. I was trying to do something similar with access log sampler setup. Basically, I created another CSV config file with the names of access log files per user sessionand use filename variabel for access log file location.

Negative 9 pSo Im trying to figure out how to sync the audio and video playback using xuggler. Im working with some code that renders decodes a video frame, and then converts it to a texture that can be rendered in libGDX. The audio gets decoded, and then sent to a dedicated thread that writes out the audio data.p  pNow everything works, the video plays back smooth, and the audio plays back flawlessly. The problem is the video and audio is about 500ms out of sync in places. I can force them to sync by doing an IContainer.seekKeyFrame operation, but this causes artifacting and some choppiness. p  pIve tried reading packets ahead and putting them to a queue, and then favouring video packets when the timestamp is behind the audio, but this results in no improvement.p  pThe full code is available on github, although what Im posting here is a more up to date versionp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comseannybgoodelibGDXEvolveLiteMediaPlayerLibrary relnofollowhttpsgithub.comseannybgoodelibGDXEvolveLiteMediaPlayerLibrarya p  pHeres the update methodp  precodepublic void updatefloat dtSeconds          ifplayState  PlayState.PLAYING return          long syncTolerance  125          long dtMilliseconds  longdtSeconds  1000         playTimeMilliseconds  dtMilliseconds          sleepTimeoutMilliseconds  long Math.max0, sleepTimeoutMilliseconds  dtMilliseconds         ifsleepTimeoutMilliseconds gt 0              The playhead is still ahead of the current frame  do nothing             return                   container.setReadRetryCount0          do              forint i  0 i lt READAHEAD                       container.readNextPacketpacket gt 0 i                              handlePackets                          ifvideoPackets.size gt 0 ampamp audioPackets.size gt 0                      ampamp videoPackets.peekNext.getTimeStamp lt audioPackets.peekNext.getTimeStamp                              packet  videoPackets.dequeue.copyReference                          else ifaudioPackets.size gt 0                              packet  audioPackets.dequeue.copyReference                              If the difference between the audio and the video is above the threshold for human perception about 75ms, seek               the video ahead.

I know how to deal with it in C with pointer, so you reference the same object to both table, but Im little bit confused in C. p  pIf I create an object and I store it in vector a and in vector b. Do C copy the object or its the same on both vector and if I modify one, the other is modified too  In the second case, does it take more place to store it twice for accessibility issues or its not a good way to deal with it  p  pThanks. p

Negative 9 pI am trying to build Firefox OS 2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04, but I keep running into an error that readsp  precodeconfigure error Only GCC 4.6 or newer supported  Fix above errors and then restart with                make f client.mk build  gt Build failed lt codepre  pThis would normally lead me to suspect I might need GCC 4.6, but I am already using that. I have successfully built 2.0 and 2.1 on this machine in the past, and 1.11.4 previously on one of the 13 versions of Ubuntu before that, and I have had codeexport CCgcc4.6code and codeexport CXXg4.6code in code.profilecode practically since I installed 14.04 on this machine.p  pTo see if I could spot anything obvious in the output I codeteecoded it to a file, and it is taking a good 7000 lines of output to reach the point where suddenly it thinks I am using a different codegcccode. If I change codeCCcode and codeCXXcode to not specify the version then it complains a lot sooner, so I take that to suggest that it is finding the right version for quite a while before complaining about thisp  pIn any case, I am not finding anything else quite like this, and my experience with building mobile OSes is admittedly limited only Firefox OS builds but up until now the instructions have either worked or produced errors I could find someone else posting about already. Hopefully someone else happens to know something about why codegcc4.6code would give an error about needing version 4.6p  h2Edith2  pTurns out, there is a a hrefhttpsbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid1121600 relnofollowBugzilla Bug Report 1121600a that mentions this. If I get the general sense of what it says, I think there is some kind of configuration thing wrong that is known to be true for some of the models that one can compile Firefox OS forp  pI thought I would go ahead and put something about that here, since I ran into that. I wish I had a better sense of what the issue was so I could just fix it for my one device, but in case that is helpful to someone else searching for this who has not come up with the terms that led me there yet, that is apparently what is going on.p

Negative 9 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comdoorkeepergemdoorkeeper relnofollowDoorkeepera to handle OAuth2 authorization in my web application. p  pSince I am the owner of the web application I should be able to use the Password Credentials grant type using only a codeclientidcode and the user credentials.p  pI am wondering if there is a way to white list the applications that are allowed to use this flowp  pMy concern is that if there is no way do whitelist them, what could stop a evil user to gather my users credentials He could take my codeclientidcode token and use it to build its own authentication interface. He would basically just ask for user credentials and send a token request to my OAuth2 provider on my behalf, using my codeclientidcode token.p  pAm I missing something herep

Negative 9 pThis is our dilemma. We have an app that uses javascript to encrypt an entered PIN value. Risk here is the encryption is exposed to the public. Although it is secured because it uses asymmetric key encryption, it is still susceptible to a brute force attack. Something like attacker entering PIN values as trial and error, encrypting it then submitting the request. So as not to allow an attacker to get hold of the encryption logic, we need another way to hide this. Moving the encryption logic to the back end would allow the PIN to be exposed during submission e.g. can be seen by browser request interceptors. p  pIs there any solution to thisp

Negative 9 pThe problem I am currently solving requires the use of two or more locks file locks in this case to avoid concurrency issues.p  pHowever I am having trouble representing the locking model I will use for the solution.p  pI.e. I would like to explain the problem and the solution I am coding via some type of diagram that lets me display the locking sequence, the concurrency implications e.g. if we release this lock before this one we will have this problem, etc and other such useful information.p  pWhat would be a good way to represent lock models p  pI have been trying to do so with a flow diagram on one hand, so  I can show the code flow that leads me to either having to obtain a lock or not e.g. I use an exclusive nonblocking lock to determine if a process is already monitoring a file, and if not I start the monitor, and on the other hand Ive been thinking that a sequence diagram would do, but I am not satisfied with the results.p  pAre there any other visual tools available that would let me represent this problem p  pHow do engineers solve this issue for really complex problems like distributed systems and such p  pIs there any one diagram for this or is it more like a collection of diagrams that are used to describe thisp

Negative 9 pI already have a website running off of Google App Engine Python, and I am trying to connect an Android app to my GAE datastore and blobstore.p  pI followed the tutorial a hrefhttpsgithub.comGoogleCloudPlatformgradleappenginetemplatestreemasterHelloEndpoints relnofollowherea, but when I deployed the Module to App Engine via Android Studio, my webpage was redirected to a page similar to thisp  pimg srchttpsiromin.files.wordpress.com201408s9.png altendpoints screenshotp  pThis obviously means that deploying the Module to App Engine is changing my deployment from python to Java and overriding my app.yaml which specifies which .py file to load and subsequently which HTML page to load as my index page.p  pI have seen lots of documentation on GAE Endpoints like a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocspythonendpoints relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocspythonendpointsgetstartedclientsandroidconnectbackend relnofollowherea, but it seems like many of these are different methodologies than the one on the github tutorial.  I would like to follow the github tutorial since it seems to be the only option utilizing the builtin Android Studio App Engine Module, but I am confused as to how I am to allow Endpoint connection from my app while maintaining my python27 version for the web.p  pAny suggestions  Thanksp

Negative 9 pI am trying to use a codeUIImagecode as a path for a marble game.  I am using codeCoreMotioncode and codeQuartzCorecode to handle moving the marble on the screen.  The codeUIImagecode is a simple black and white image where the path is black and the rest of the image is a white background.  I have the code to move the marble, but when I try to check the color of the path image beneath it, the animation on the marble stops and it no longer moves.  If I comment out the line of code that determines the pixel color of the Path image the marble moves fine.  What am I missing to keep the marble moving when I check the color of the pixelp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]       Movement of marble1     self.lastUpdateTime  [[NSDate alloc] init]     self.curPoint   CGPointMake443, 350     self.motionManager  [[CMMotionManager alloc]  init]     self.queue          [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init]     self.motionManager.accelerometerUpdateInterval  kUpdateInterval     [self.motionManager startAccelerometerUpdatesToQueueself.queue withHandler      CMAccelerometerData accelerometerData, NSError error           [id self setAccelerationaccelerometerData.acceleration]          [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorupdate withObjectnil waitUntilDoneNO]      ]    voidupdate      NSTimeInterval secondsSinceLastDraw  [self.lastUpdateTime timeIntervalSinceNow]     self.marble1YVelocity  self.marble1YVelocity  self.acceleration.x  secondsSinceLastDraw     self.marble1XVelocity  self.marble1XVelocity  self.acceleration.y  secondsSinceLastDraw     CGFloat xDelta  secondsSinceLastDraw  self.marble1XVelocity  500     CGFloat yDelta  secondsSinceLastDraw  self.marble1YVelocity  500     self.curPoint  CGPointMakeself.curPoint.x  xDelta,                                     self.curPoint.y  yDelta     [self moveMarble1]     self.lastUpdateTime  [NSDate date]    voidmoveMarble1      [self collisionWithWalls]     [self collisionWithBoundaries]     self.prevPoint  self.curPoint     CGRect frame  self.marble1.frame     frame.origin.x  self.curPoint.x     frame.origin.y  self.curPoint.y     self.marble1.frame  frame    voidcollisionWithWalls         CGRect frame  self.marble1.frame     frame.origin.x  self.curPoint.x     frame.origin.y  self.curPoint.y     NSLogxf,yf,frame.origin.x,frame.origin.y     CALayer pathLayer  [self.Path.layer presentationLayer]     if I comment out the following line the marble moves with no issues on the screen     NSLogColor of path is ,[self pixelColorInImagepathLayer atXself.curPoint.x atYself.curPoint.y]      UIColorpixelColorInImageCALayerlayer atXintx atYinty      UIImage image[self imageFromLayerlayer]        CFDataRef pixelData  CGDataProviderCopyDataCGImageGetDataProviderimage.CGImage     const UInt8 data  CFDataGetBytePtrpixelData     int pixelInfo  image.size.width   y  x   4  4 bytes per pixel     UInt8 red    data[pixelInfo  0]     UInt8 green  data[pixelInfo  1]     UInt8 blue   data[pixelInfo  2]     UInt8 alpha  data[pixelInfo  3]     CFReleasepixelData     return [UIColor colorWithRedred255.0f                            greengreen255.0f                             blueblue255.0f                            alphaalpha255.0f]    UIImage imageFromLayerCALayer layer        if [[UIScreen mainScreen] respondsToSelectorselectorscale]         UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions[layer frame].size, NO, [UIScreen mainScreen].scale     else         UIGraphicsBeginImageContext[layer frame].size      [layer renderInContextUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext]     UIImage outputImage  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext         UIGraphicsEndImageContext     return outputImage  codepre
