Positive 5910 pIm looking for tips on how to further investigate whats going on. The situation is basicallyp  ptop shows that my process is using 10 CPU, meaning that its run for an hour and has only used 6 mins of cpu time. This is a process kicked off by a long python script which logs the command it uses to start the process. When I run that command on the machine, a new process of the same name starts up with 100 cpu utilization. I have no idea why this would happen anyone have any thoughts, seen anything similar, or any insights on how to debug this further The fact that starting the exact process up with the same command indicates to me something odd is happening...p
Positive 5910 pIm trying to better understand communication between pipes, so I tried to make a program that has two child processes, and communicates BOTH ways with both of these processes. It simply takes the integer i, defines it, and sends it to them. They then redefine it and send it back. However, when I run this code the parent process prints the i as if it never was changed in the child process, while both child processes print out a value of 20, as I expected.

Positive 5910 pFirst I have to mention that I run on a CentOS 7 tuned up to support 1 million connections. I tested with a simple C server and client and I connected 512000 clients.

The Tags that start with SG denote that there is a loopp  pThe problem I face is that the format is very flexible, where it can have conditional segments, conditional loops, repeated segments. Trying to think of a method that can handle all this has been my issue. p  pStarting from the top in the above specification, you can immeditely see that when you come to the DTM tag, it can be repeated upto a max of 10 times. In the sample EDIFACT message, it only appears 3 times on lines 5, 6, 7. Following the specification, FTX may appear but does not in my sample message, then there is a SG2 tag, which means the following NAD tag may repeat 99 times.p  pMoving slightly ahead inside the LIN tag which is under the SG12 group, which can repeat upto 9999 times and in many cases does repeat a number of times, it comes to the first QTY tag. According to the specification, this segment can have conditional group SG15 RFF and a DTM under it. Using my sample, you can see on line 17 and 18 that it has the QTY segment but line 18, has this conditional group too.p  pSimiliar things start happening when you look into the SCC segments too.p  pWhat I have in my mind, is to be able to enter that specification into some sort of file format, then run the raw EDIFACT message against the rules of this specification so the output is hierarchy based so its easy to see at a glance what data relates to what segment and a way to check to see if the EDIFACT message is valid.p  pWhat I have trouble with, is the actual algorithm or process to do that conversion.p  pI have tried naive approaches, like going line by line but then it gets messy when I am trying to work out if the current line is in a group, or a repeat or something else. I have tried a recursive approach, by splitting the entire EDIFACT by the largest group The SG12LIN group, then recursively process each of them splits and build an output. This has been my best approach yet but its still far from working with many false readings due to my logic not being right. p  pI basically need to be able to pick a segment of the message, and determine where in the hierarchy it should be and display it.p  pI am at a loss on how I can solve this. I am sure there is a nice simple method at doing this but I just cannot work it out.p  pAny assistance would be most grateful. p

But here happens another thing  if I kill other.exe it kills whole tree, because killing parent kills children...p  pIm looking for any clue what could cause this situation and how to properly kill process tree.p  pAny ideasp  pPS I cant control creation of other.exe processes.

Positive 5910 pAlright so Im going to try to explain one problem at a time so you can understand the issues Im having and hopefully someone will be able to tell me hoe to fix it. So my app runs perfectly but my users have been complaining of high ram usage and on average it runs any where from 120mb to 200mb IDLE which I agree isnt right so I went ahead and remembered a trick I used in a previous project and that was this line of code androidhardwareAcceleratedfalse. This removes about 10mb of ram per activity but Im still sitting at about 90mb of usage so i went and looked a little harder and found this androidprocessProcessName which takes my app from using 100mb to a mere 8mb of ram. But Im facing a problem while doing this and that is the fact that I have a LocalBroadcastManager in a service activity that sends data to my MainActivity and when these two have different processes they dont communicate with each other, and if I combine them into the same process the usage spikes yet again. So Im kinda stuck what to do at this point and I refuse to use the Android Memory debugger because it doesnt tell me jack crap about what my code is doing wrong. Quite literally I have 5 text views and an imageview inside of my MainActivity so I know its not that intensive by any means If anyone needs code please let me know but I figured someone really didnt need to look at the code to answer thisp

Negative 5910 pIm working on a large legacy java application for which an important feature was automatic scaling of GUI Components based on monitor resolution.  We are upgrading the JVM on which it runs from 1.4.2 to 1.6 and now the scaling is broken due to a change in the implementation of java.awt.Container.getPreferredSize.p  pgetPrefferedSize used to return the same object that you gave with setPreferredSize everything also goes for minmax size, so what we would do is call setPRefferedSize on every scaling component with a particular subclass of java.awt.Dimension, then we would walk the component hierarchy and update each scaling component whenever the resolution changed.p  pHowever in Java 1.6 getPreferredSize returns a copy of the Dimension object you passed it, so it is no longer the right type and nothing gets scaled.p  pI hacked together a solution pretty quick by overriding the Component class with my own implementation thank you open source JRE by placing it in front of the JRE on the class path.  However this solution is clearly not maintainable.p  pDoes anyone else know any other solution to this problem, how would you implement GUI scaling in java 1.51.6p

Negative 5910 pI can name three advantages to using codedoublecode or codefloatcode instead of codedecimalcodep  ol liUses less memory.li liFaster because floating point math operations are natively supported by processors.li liCan represent a larger range of numbers.li ol  pBut these advantages seem to apply only to calculation intensive operations, such as those found in modeling software. Of course, doubles should not be used when precision is required, such as financial calculations. So are there any practical reasons to ever choose codedoublecode or codefloatcode instead of codedecimalcode in normal applicationsp  pEdited to add Thanks for all the great responses, I learned from them.p  pOne further question A few people made the point that doubles can more precisely represent real numbers. When declared I would think that they usually more accurately represent them as well. But is it a true statement that the accuracy may decrease sometimes significantly when floating point operations are performedp

Negative 5910 pI have a requirement to create a component which can be used standalone or within a larger application.  When used standalone, it should not require a database, nor any databaseORM related dependencies.  When used as as part of a larger app, some of the classes will indeed be persisted to a database via JPAHibernate.p  pI was thinking the domain objects in the component would not have any annotations due to the requirement to not have any ORMrelated dependencies.  In the larger app, I would then subclass those domain objects...which is about as far as Ive made it.p  pTypically, I use fieldlevel Annotations.  Is it possible to due with with the scenario described above  Im thinking its not.  p  pThe other thought I had to switch to annotating the properties.  In which case, Id extends the nonannotated domain object, override all the properties, amp annotate those.  The child would just be a delegate with the required annotations.  This just seem like a lot of workcode.p  pIronically, I think this would be more easily doable if I was using hbm.xml, which weve recently moved away from.  Am I missing something with annotationsp

Negative 5910 pIm at my wits end on this one. I occasionally get the error above from my .Net 2.0 asmx web service. Ive got the proper XmlInclude in place, and it only appears sometimes  when I rebuild and update the site, it may show up, it may not, no rhyme or reason. If I move some of the XmlIncludes around, rebuild, and push the changes up, the error usually goes away. p  pPrior to having the build process in place that converts everything to a DLL, I was using the good ol xcopy deployment method. The error happened then, too, but then all I had to do was add a space to the file that defined all the XmlInclude calls, and IIS would recompile and the error would go away.p  pFor what its worth, there are a LOT of XmlIncludes defined, about 100 or so.p  pAny ideasp  pHeres a snippetp  precodenamespace Courses      [Serializable]     [XmlIncludetypeofUserToCourse,     XmlIncludetypeofUserToCourseCollection,              ...lots more....

I made a change to the global.asax to attempt to fix my stack trace logging, rebuilt and updated, and one of the two methods started working. I then split the class with the XmlIncludes on it into 2 partial classes, rebuilt, updated, and both methods started working again. Im not sure if this is a permanent fix or not at this moment, because its so random Ill update on the next build cycle again.p  pEdit 3 Definitely not a permanent fix, and Im still not hooked into the right place to catch a full stack trace although my other logs are all working fine.

Negative 5910 pConsider a card game along the lines of Tower Solitaire, Tripeaks, or Fairway Solitaire the table consists of some number of cards which are immediately available, each of which might be covering other cards underneath it blocking them from being played. You have one foundation card, and you can remove a card from the table if its exactly one rank above or below your foundation card, at which point it becomes your new foundation card. You have a limited number of replacement cards to draw from when you cant play a card from the table, so you generally want to play the longest sequence of cards possible.p  pFirst, how would you represent the board to facilitate finding a solution Second, what algorithm would you use to find the longest playable sequencep  pExamplep  pre  4a 5 3  2 4bpre  pCards on the bottom block cards on top from being removed you cant remove 4a until both 3 and 2 are gone. Assuming your starting card is an ace, the optimal play here would be 2, 3, 4b, 5, 4a. You could play 2, 3, 4a instead, but thats not as good.p  pI suppose this should be represented as some kind of directed graph. Youd have edges from 3 and 2 to 4a and from 2 and 4b to 5, but would you also have edges between 3 and 2 and between 4a and 5, since one is playable after the other If so, would the fact that they can be played in either order 3 then 2, or 2 then 3 form a cycle in the graph that prevents you from using the efficient longest path algorithms I believe finding the longest path in a graph is NPcomplete if the graph contains cycles.p

Negative 5910 pI am trying to migrate existing code that uses XmlSerializer to protobufnet due to the increased performance it offers, however I am having problems with this specific case.p  pI have an object[] that includes parameters that are going to be sent to a remote host sort of a custom mini rpc facility. I know the set of types from which these parameters can be, but I cannot tell in advance in which order they are going to be sent.  I have three constraints. The first is that I am running in Compact Framework, so I need something that works there. Second, as I mentioned performance is a big concern on the serializing side so I would rather avoid using a lot of reflection there if possible. And the most important is that I care about the order in which this parameters were sent. Using XmlSerializer it was easy just adding XmlInclude, but for fields there is nothing equivalent as far as I know in Protobufnet. So, is there a way to do this Here is a simplified example.p  precode    [Serializable]     [XmlIncludetypeofMyType1,      XmlIncludetypeofMyType2,      XmlIncludetypeofMyType3     public class Message               public object[] parameters           public Messageobject[] parms                        parameters  parms                      Message m  new Messagenew object[] MyType1, 33, test,                  new MyType3, new MyType3     MemoryStream ms  new MemoryStream     XmlSerializer xml  new XmlSerializertypeofMessage     xml.Serializems,xml codepre  pThat will just work with XmlSerializer, but if I try to convert it to protobufnet I will get a No default encoding for Object message. p  pThe best I came up with is to use generics and [ProtoInclude] as seen in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1296791protobufattributeswithahierarchyofgenericclasses12968451296845examplea. Since I can have different object types within the array this doesnt quite make it. I added a generic List for each potential type and a property with [ProtoIgnore] with type object[] to add them and get them. I have to use reflection when adding them to know in which array to put each item which is not desirable and I still cant preserve the ordering as I just extract all the items on each list one by one and put them into a new object[] array on the property get.p  pI wonder if there is a way to accomplish thisp  hr  pI tried what Marc suggested below, but I couldnt get it to work. I think I may have misunderstood something. p  pUsing the code you wrote. I thought I should use MessageParam Create to generate MessageParam objects to add to the list. So basically I added a constructor to Message like thisp  precodepublic Messageobject[] parms      foreach object o in parms              parameters.AddMessageParam.Createo       codepre  pBut, if i do that I will get Unexpected type found during serialization types must be included with ProtoIncludeAttribute found MessageParam1 passed as MessageParam because I assume the serializer is expecting the nongeneric version. Did I misunderstand your suggestion If so, what is the right thing to dop

Negative 5910 pIm getting started with unit testing and trying to do some TDD. Ive read a fair bit about the subject and written a few tests. I just want to know if the following is the right approach. p  pI want to add the usual contact us facility on my web site. You know the thing, the user fills out a form with their email address, enters a brief message and hits a button to post the form back.p  pThe model binders do their stuff and my action method accepts the posted data as a model. The action method would then parse the model and use smtp to send an email to the web site administrator infoming himher that somebody filled out the contact form on their site.p  pNow for the question .... In order to test this, would I be right in creating an interface emIMessageServiceem that has a method emSendemailAddress, messageem to accept the email address and message body. Implement the inteface in a concrete class and let that class deal with smtp stuff and actually send the mail.p  pIf I add the interface as a parameter to my controller constructor I can then use DI and IoC to inject the concrete class into the controller. But when unit testing I can create a fake or mock version of my emIMessageServiceem and do assertions on that.p  pThe reason I ask is that Ive seen other examples of people generating interfaces for SmtpClient and then mocking that. Is there really any need to go that far or am I not understanding this stuffp

Negative 5910 pI have a C application, where I have to get the processor load. According to the accepted answer for a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2938629howcanigetcpuloadpercoreincthisa question, my options are to either use performance counters from either WMI or the System.Diagnostics namespace. I have a problem with the System.Diagnostics performance counter as documented a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3517245whydoesnextvaluecallofperformancecounterchangethreadaffinitymaskherea, so my only option is to use WMI. The following code shows how I read the processor load using WMIp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Management  namespace ProcessorUtilizationSpike      class Program              private static ManagementObject processor          static void Mainstring[] args                      processor  new ManagementObjectWin32PerfFormattedDataPerfOSProcessor.NameTotal              whiletrue                              PrintTimedMeasure                                static void PrintTimedMeasure                      DateTime start  DateTime.Now             UInt64 wmi  WMIMeasure             DateTime stop  DateTime.Now             Console.WriteLinewmi    wmi  , time   stop  start                   static UInt64 WMIMeasure                      processor.Get             return UInt64processor.Properties[PercentProcessorTime].Value  this property corresponds to a UInt64, see the Type property.                codepre  pMy problem is, that it takes around half a second to retrieve the processor utilization, as can be seen from this typical snippet of outputp  precodewmi  6, time 000000.5156250 wmi  3, time 000000.5156250 wmi  4, time 000000.5000000 wmi  3, time 000000.5156250 wmi  3, time 000000.5000000 codepre  pMy guess is that at least part of the reason, that it takes so long to sample the load, is that the Get method call also updates other properties of the ManagementObject object. So my question is How can I make the Get method call update faster I would guess, that the solution is to somehow tell the ManagementObject object to only update the processor load property, but I dont know how to do that. p  pAs an aside, it is curious that the sample times of the output are so stable around half a second, but I am not sure if that can give any hints toward the solution.p

Negative 5910 pIm in the planning phase of our new site  its an extension of some mobile apps weve built.

One of the features were looking at adding is a reputation system similar in nature to the SO badge system. Were designing the system to use SOA.p  pI dont want to have to code all of this logic into the main app as discreet chunks. Im thinking of creating a means to accomplish this which will allow us to define new thresholds and rules for gaining reputation and have them injected into some service. The two ways Ive thought of doing this so far arep  ol liTo look for certain traits in a users actions and respond, this would mean having a service running that can run through the plugged in award definitions and check for thresholds that have been met and respond appropriately.li liTo fire events when the user performs actions  listen out for those events and respond appropriately. Because the services which will be carrying out these actions are running in separate app domains potentially on separate servers the only way I can see having a central message bus to listen and respond to these events is by using something like MassTransit, nServiceBus or Rhino.Esb. li ol  pI know that using a service bus can very easily be inappropriately designed into an application that simply doesnt need it and most times  unless youre integrating disparate, heterogenous systems  you most likely wont need one when designing a new system  but Im a bit lost for options as to the best way to do this. I dont like the idea of having a service hammer the Db all the time in the background. But it does sound like it might be a lot simpler early on  later on  I dread to think p  pHas anyone here designed a system like this How did you accomplish this Were designing for high throughput as we expect there will be times when the system will need to be able to cope with bursts of users.p

Negative 5910 pIm trying hard to design following the SOLID principles. What Ive found is that when you use the Single Responsibility Principle the S of SOLID you usually have to split classes between the data containers and the data processors. For example If I have a class person with 5 properties that is read from DB instead of putting everything inside a class I create a Person class with the properties and another PersonReader class that reads that information from the database and creates the Person.p  pIf I do that I have to open the Person properties so PersonReader could access them but then I have less encapsulation than putting everything inside a black box and making the properties only readable.p  pAm I missing something or is this a drawback of this principlep  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT Ive changed the person writer to a person reader because there was no need to make property setters public at the beginning.p

Negative 5910 pWe have an application where we design a label, and then create an image from the design which is sent to a printer. The image is made into a byte stream before being sent over TCPIP.p  pThe short story is that we have a rotation setting that automatically calculates the position of the different elements on the label. And it is not working properly.p  pI was wondering if there is an easy way to calculate position of an element relative to heightwidth of the containing rectangle label size. It also needs to take into account that this is a bitmap, so the top left corner is 0,0. This is what confuses me, because most of the rotation algorithms I have found operates on an a regular XY axis.p  pSo, say I have a label 500 x 300 Width x height with a point textbox at 100,100 upper leftish. I want to rotate this 90 degrees, so that the label is now 300 x 500,  with the textbox at 200 x 100 upper rightish. Note, the rectangle calculation takes care of itself, I just need to find the point relative to the new sides.p  pI found 180 degrees width  x, height  y, but having a hard time spotting the algorithm for 90 and 270p  pProbably no rocket surgery involved here, but I have stared myself blind at this problem. p

Negative 5910 pThis is it, for all the marbles, if I can get this issue solved then I have a project completed.p  pAnyway, I am using Ruby on Rails 3 with Devise for user authentication. As you may know, in the user adminedit by default, a user has to enter their current password in the currentpassword field if they provide a new password. There is a TON of information out there on how to disable currentpassword so users can change and save freely.p  pHowever, I can find very little on doing the opposite requiring the current password for more fields...in my case, the email field. AND only require the current password when that email addy is changed, not if it remains the same. Currently users can freely change their email without giving their current password, and for security reasons, I dont want this.p  pAfter looking through the Devise wiki, I did find a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowToAllowuserstoedittheiraccountwithoutprovidingapasswordthis pagea and I thought I could reverse this code to complete this solution. I managed to work this little bit out in my user.rb model I stripped out of the unnecessary logic for this post....p  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase    Include default devise modules. Others available are    tokenauthenticatable, confirmable, lockable and timeoutable   devise databaseauthenticatable, registerable, confirmable,          recoverable, rememberable, trackable, validatable     Setup accessible or protected attributes for your model   attraccessible name, email, password, passwordconfirmation, avatar, rememberme, agree   attraccessor accessible, agree, signedin   attrreadonly name     Validation   validates name, presence gt TRUE, uniqueness gt TRUE, length gt  within gt 4..20    validates agree, termagreement gt TRUE, unless gt signedin   validatesattachmentsize avatar, lessthan gt 1.megabyte   validatesattachmentcontenttype avatar, contenttype gt [imagejpeg, imagepng, imagegif]   validates currentpassword, presence gt TRUE, if gt passwordrequired    protected    def passwordrequired     emailchanged   end  end codepre  pIt almost works. If I save the user profile with changing nothing, or change other nonpassword required field like the user avatar, the profile saves fine, no password required. So far, so good.p  pAnd if I change the email address, the validation emisem triggered....but what happens is that both the currentpassword AND password for new password fields trigger as required. And if I fill in the password in all three password, passwordconfirmation, currentpassword just for the hell of it, it wont take, just gives a validation error again.p  pBasically, ONLY the currentpassword should be required if the email address is changed. How would I make this work in my codep  ul liUPDATE strongememstrongli ul  pI checked out my log in response to the below suggestion by bowsersenior, and see the following lines when I attempt to save and update the email...p  precodeUser Load 0.2ms  SELECT users.id FROM users WHERE LOWERusers.email  LOWERnewaddresschanged.com AND users.id ltgt 1 LIMIT 1   User Load 0.2ms  SELECT users.id FROM users WHERE users.name  BINARY Administrator AND users.id ltgt 1 LIMIT 1   SQL 0.1ms  ROLLBACK codepre  pI wonder if that ROLLBACK has something to do with the final issuep

Negative 5910 pScala is very elegant in filtering immutable sequencesp  precodevar l  List1,2,3,4,5,6 l  l.filter21 codepre  pBut how do I do this with a mutable collections like ArrayBuffer All I found is the removal of single elements or slices, or remove elements from another sequence, but nothing that removes elements given by a predicate.p  pEdit I was hoping to find something similar tho thisp  precodetrait Removable[A] extends Buffer[A]    def removeIfp A gt Boolean     var it1  0     var it2  0      whileit2 lt length       if p thisit2           it2  1               else          thisit1  thisit2         it1  1         it2  1                  trimEndit2it1     codepre  pthis filters in linear time and can be mixed into any Buffer, but only ArrayBuffer makes sense, on ListBuffers it would be slow, because indexing does take linear time.p

Negative 5910 pI would need to maintain a list of about 20000 objects of a class. This class would be a managed wrapper for a c one. I would like to know if a ref class or a value class is they way to go.p  pI was told the following for proscons w.r.t GC p  pIn the case of a value class, there is a single point to garbage collect vs reference class with a pointer, where there would be 20000 objects to garbage collect. Also there is no finalizer or destructor for value class and hence these objects wont end up in the finalization queue which is single threaded.p  pCan someone elaborate on the functioning of the GC in both these cases for large lists of objects.p

Negative 5910 pI know that Tkinter is just a thin layer over TclTk. Tkinter you can do a few things to change the windows styling. One example would be coderoot.attributestoolwindow, Truecode.

Negative 5910 pIn a Django project, unit test are usually organized by app, with Django providing a facility to run all of the tests, the tests for a single app, a single test case, or a single test method.p  pYet, I find that test cases in a single application usually belong to separate logical groups or clusters, and it would be often useful to be able to only run a single group of tests. Imagine, for examplep  ul liI have several test cases covering each a different configuration of a single model, and I want to run all of them and just them while developing the model. This is especially troublesome, because the cheap way to do that is to lump the test cases together, so now you have a single test case which you can easily run, but is a nightmare to read and maintain.li liI have a series of utility classes whose tests are extremely quick because they do not hit the database. I dont need to run model tests and view tests while refactoring these.li ul  pI searched around.

Negative 5910 pIm developing a multitouch library for Flash and not to reinvent all the wheels I try to check how other developers code similar stuff. One of the biggest problems is gestures with multiple fingers involved more than 2. The gestures in question are panmove, pinchzoomscale and rotate.p  pIts not obvious how these gestures should behave with more than 2 fingers at all. Looking at Photos app on iPad I see that photos react on first two touches only. And if you press one finger, press another finger, press the third thinger and remove the first finger  zoom gesture will stop working even if you have and indeed you do 2 fingers touching same photo. That doesnt seem logical.p  pWhat Im trying to do is to break points into 2 clusters and work with them. But it brings more unresolved problems.p  pSo, the question is the following How do multitouch gestures in iOS behave if more than 2 fingers are involved Is there any guideline or everyone implements whatever they feel like doingp

I followed this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6599918uipopovercontrollertoolbarattopUIPopoverController toolbar at topa in order to get started.  In my controller that is the rootViewController of the navigationController, I can create a UISegmentControl and place it at the top.  However, it does not look like the picture in that its not centered.  Maybe because the way I get it into the popover is in the viewDidLoad of the popover like this p  precode   UISegmentedControl topSegmentControl  [[UISegmentedControl alloc] initWithItems[NSArray arrayWithObjectsOne, Two, Three, Four, nil]]     topSegmentControl.backgroundColor  [UIColor clearColor]     topSegmentControl.segmentedControlStyle  UISegmentedControlStyleBar     UIBarButtonItem toolBarCustom  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomViewtopSegmentControl]     UIBarButtonItem spaceItem  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItemUIBarButtonSystemItemFlexibleSpace targetnil actionnil]     self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem  toolBarCustom codepre  pAlso, if I want to present data at the bottom of the popovercontroller in a toolbar, Im not sure where to do that.

Im also not sure how to center the data.  Thanks.p

Negative 5910 pIt would appear that the Java machine fails on certain types of loop that appear to be infinite to its system check but are in fact terminated by code outside the loops class. This does not happen often, but it was most noticeably found in my recent TickleService, where finite loops of code ran without trouble but loops that required ANY outside termination failed. For examplep  precodeclass TickleService extends Service ...     void execute         whiletrue             Log.eTest,Tickle             wait1000               ...  codepre  pThe above caused an immediate system ANR crashCPU usage 99 exception. However, the following version would run only once and cease further operation without ever crashingp  precodepublic class TickleService extends Service ...     public static boolean amNotAlive  false     void execute         whiletrue           Log.eTest,Tickle           ifamNotAlive             break           wait1000               ...  codepre  pThe above loop executed once and ceased to loop. Next, if the code had a finite loop it would execute flawlesslyp  precodepublic class TickleService extends Service ...     public static boolean amNotAlive  false     void execute         forint i  0 ilt5i             Log.eTest,Tickle             wait1000               ...  codepre  pThis above loop would run 5 times each one second apart as expected. Ultimately, the fix I applied was to run the following in which I tried to trick the JVM into thinking that no looping was occurring at allp  precodepublic class TickleService extends Service  ...  public static boolean amAlive  true  void execute     Log.eTest,Tickle     wait1000     ifamAlive       restartService pseudo code for doing startService on self    ...  codepre  pThis trick executed without exception and reliably produced tickles one second apart. Many tests were run, all confirmed that continuous loops failed if they terminated according to triggers outside the class, but ran correctly if terminated internally. Ultimately, while I strongly suspect either a purposeful design flaw or unintended bug in the Dalvik java machine causes this problem, but the evidence was only circumstantial. Furthermore, the problem does not seem to occur for all services that I have written in Android. Does anyone know why this is I would love to understand this problem better.p

Negative 5910 pI am researching archiving options for our database application highly normalized schema and would appreciate expert feedback.  We are using Sql Server 2005, but if something works only in 2008 R2 that may be an option for us.p  pPrimary reason for archiving is to remove old data on an annual basis.  The criteria to determine which objects can be archived will not be straightforward ie not just filtering by a date, but many more considerations involved.p  pArchiving needs to be basically a push button on the application ie not by actual DBA on the database server.  p  pData should be retrievable, but perhaps by special request.  Perhaps an object and all its related pieces could be searched for and brought back into the current database  Again, via the application interface.p  pAnother important requirement is to maintain integrity of related data.  If an archived object is related to a nonarchived object, I want to ensure the nonarchived object cant be deleted through the interface.  Currently we have many checks in place to ensure you cant delete items if theyre in use, and I hesitate to alter all of those checks to join an archive table or use a new view.  Is there another wayp  pI have read about tableindex partitioning and although it is interesting, it sounds like perhaps a LOT of work considering how many stored procedures, views, indexes, etc that we use.p

Now both start from zero, but I would want the second half figure 2 to be from 86 to 171 or with intervals of 10 so that they are from 80 to 180, for instance. I tried setgca, XLim, [86  171] to the second figure, but what happened was that bars in that figure ended up outside the figure, which I hadnt thought before... Any hints how to solve the problem with the Xticksdividing the figure p  pI also have another question about Xticks I would want to move them downwards in the figure, since I have added text or actually other numbers which correspond to different bars right above every bar. I made the figures to fit the whole screen by setgcf, Position, get0,Screensize, but Xticks should be moved downwards so that Xticks and and other numbers are not on top of each other. I would like to learn how to solve these problems, but it seems like I need help from someone who has more experiencep

Negative 5910 pIve got an interesting dilemma that has stumped me and a coworker. Im trying to construct a sql query that will allow me to pull phone extensions for an employee to be published on a public website. In our phone system SQL Server 2000 based a user can have up to three extensions so far a 3XXX number direct line, a 5XXX boss groups, for a person with a secretary and multiline phones and a 7XXX voicemail.p  pMost people have either a 3XXX or 7XXX extension. Only a few have the 5XXX, but we also have people who, via promotions, have gained additional numbers. For example, a teacher who only gets a voicemail7XXX was promoted to Assistance Principal and gets a direct line3XXX and then become a Director and gets a secretary, thus a 5XXX.p  pWe want to publish these numbers in the order of 5XXX then 3XXX then 7XXX, so most of the direct routes using ORDER BY are out the window. Ive gotten the query to the point where it will return something like thisp  precodeUserID  Extension Employee ID   USER 1  3234      1234 USER 1  5235      1234 USER 1  7364      1234 codepre  pI cannot, however, rely on the order that they may be in, due to when their extension was added to the system. I also have no control over removing the other extensions.p  pWe tried doing some case statements but ran into nothing very good. Below is the SQL we are using which is becoming very complicated and is way over my head. Can anyone shine some light on how we can intelligently get one value into each row that would return the employee ID and phone extension based on the rules from above The firstname, lastname stuff is just for checking and not part of the final.p  pSorry if this sound like a lot, just getting desperate over here.p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT  FirstName, LastName, PrimaryFaxNumber, MAXCASE WHEN Expr1 IS NOT NULL THEN Expr1 ELSE CASE WHEN Expr2 IS NOT NULL                        THEN Expr2 ELSE Expr3 END END AS Extension FROM         SELECT     sub.FirstName, sub.LastName, sub.PrimaryFaxNumber, da.DtmfAccessId, CASE WHEN LEFTCASTda.DtmfAccessId AS nvarchar, 1                                                 5 THEN da.DtmfAccessId END AS Expr1, CASE WHEN LEFTCASTda.DtmfAccessId AS nvarchar, 1                                                 3 THEN da.DtmfAccessId END AS Expr2, CASE WHEN LEFTCASTda.DtmfAccessId AS nvarchar, 1                                                 7 THEN da.DtmfAccessId END AS Expr3                        FROM          Subscriber sub FULL OUTER JOIN                                               DtmfAccessId da ON da.ParentObjectId  sub.SubscriberObjectId                        WHERE      sub.SubscriberObjectId IS NOT NULL AND sub.PrimaryFaxNumber IS NOT NULL AND CASTda.DtmfAccessId AS BIGINT lt 9999                        DERIVEDTBL GROUP BY FirstName, LastName, PrimaryFaxNumber ORDER BY LastName, FirstName codepre
Negative 5910 pIve searched the database but havent really found anything that would answer my question. Im new with Ajax so Ill try to describe it as good as I can.p  pI am trying to build a rating system for images with only two options AcceptReject. I have a paginated gallery with 10k images and they all need to be rated for the competition. Theres a special system for rating acceptingrejecting and then theres this overview gallery. Every thumbnail that has already been rated should display a clickable textimage, for example Accepted, depending on the database value. Youd be then able to click on this textimage and it would change to Rejected and the mysql database entry would also change at the same time.p  pLeft initial state of the Accepted image.

Negative 5910 pCurrently all users of my application have .NET 2.0 installed and launch it through ClickOnce. The way users launch this application is by clicking a link in some other page that references the .application file in IIS. Also some users have a shortcut in their desktops that points to the same link.p  pI recently upgraded my app to .NET 4 CP and I need to create a new deployment. The problem is most of the users do not have .NET 4 installed so in this new deployment I must make sure they will be prompted to install it.p  pIf I simply deploy it and ask a user to open the new ClickOnce link, they are shown a message saying they need to have .NET 4 and then contact your system administrator. I generated the bootstrapper but because the app is launched directly through the .application file I dont think it will ever work.p  pThe only solution I have is to create another ClickOnce app that is developed in .NET 2.0 and works as a launcher. This small app would check if .NET 4 is installed. If yes then launch the new app another link otherwise launches .NET 4 setup and ask the user to try again after reboot.p  pIm looking to have a more easy process for the user, does anyone know Creating a custom installer does not seem to solve my problem since it must run in .NET 4 which is not installed yet.p

Negative 5910 pThis is an open MVC related question and Im looking for critique and advice.p  pbrief version ViewA is used to view ModelA. If ModelB extends ModelA and ViewB is used to view ModelB would ViewB inherit from ViewAp  pbackgroundp  pI have created a Graph class, containing an array of vertices and an array of edges. The vertices have each a nsized array of integer data.p  pI also created a GraphViewer class for 2dGraphs, that simply draws lines for edges and dots for vertices.p  pNow I decided to create a GraphEditor Class, that is a graph with editing capabilities, for instance it needs to have methods and fields that allow user interaction example selectVertex  a method that accepts the current mouse coodinates and returns the vertex closest to that point, and selectedVertices  an array of all vertices selectedp  pI decided that GraphEditor will inherit from Graph. Because GraphEditor is still a graph only with editing capabilities.p  pNow I wanted to create a GraphEditorViewer that will need to draw selected vertices in a different colorfor instance and I thought since GraphEditor extends Graph, perhaps GraphEditorViewer should extend GraphViewer, however I find that is not the case since the new class GraphEditorViewer does not view regular Graphs. So I decided to use a hasa relationship between GraphEditorViewer and GraphViewer. That meant that I had to expose a lot of rendering related methods of GraphViewer so I could call them from the new class.p  pI am wondering if you would go about it differently and what do you think about my choice.p  pThanksp
Negative 5910 pI want to create a notes app for Windows Phone 7 using Visual Basic. I have read a few tutorials but they are all suited for C not VB. Basically, I have a main page and a page to add notes. Once the user types out a note on the add notes page, the title of that note appears on the main page. I also want the user to be able to select that title and it will display the note. I have done a bit of research and I know I will need to use isolated storage not sure how to implement it in VB to save the notes. I think I will also need a list box that will store the title of the notes. I am not asking for someone to just give me code, I am asking for some tutorials regarding this in VB or any pointers or general help on acheiving this. Thanksp

Negative 5910 pemI have to evaluate Sencha Touch for building native Ipad html5 based apps. I was wondering which version should I start with v1.1 or v2.0emp  pI bought a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1849515107 relnofollowthisa book and created a simple html5 app with Panels, proxies, MVC, toolbars and integrated it with Java Spring and freemarker templates. All worked perfectly , the book was excellent and the onine documentation was great. This was with version v1.1.p  pThen Sencha announced that v2 is out with lot of improvements especially in performance. This made me think whether I should start again with 2.0 or just continue building on my prototype with v1.1 and wait till v2.0 gets more mature and has more documentation.p

Negative 5910 pI am trying to use TinyURL with facebook comments plugin and running into some issues because of the fbcommentid that gets tacked on by facebook for the links on the wall. What I intend to do is when user clicks on the link on the wall comment, I am sending them to an intermediate server side php script which processes some data based on GET params and redirects the user to the appropriate page with appropriate settings. However, I am trying to hide this intermediate page and settings for it from the user as well as make it much more elegant by using TinyURL unless user explicitly digs into it. But when I pass the tinyurl to facebook comments plugin, the appended fbcommentid param totally messes up tinyurl and I get an error page. Any thoughts on how to address thisp  pThanksp

Negative 5910 pWhile making my program i have come across this requirement that i have to assign unique ids to some Objects that i create.

With the next new node, everytime i have to use the latest counter value and this creates lot of missing int values if nodes are deleted during the process.  p  pI wanted to reuse those missing ids upon creating of new nodes, for this i am confused which approach i should addopt.p  pstrongMY Ideasstrong  p  ol li Using a ArrayList that contains the available values, plus if a node is deleted, its id is added to this list, i sort this list and use the minimum value for new node.

Negative 5910 pI have designed a responsive web site and built a prototype with Compass Susy. p  pThe problem I am having, on Mobile Safari on iPad and iPhone, is that when I load the site in portrait mode, then rotate to landscape, the entire layout jumps maybe 30 to the right it also scales up the zoom to fit the 480px landscape width.p  pI have tried several things, and I notice that changing the meta viewport tag from  codeltmeta contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1 nameviewportgtcode to codeltmeta contentwidthdevicewidth nameviewportgtcode removing initial scale the jump does not occur.  p  pHowever, without that property, my phone layout is too small, even at the initial portrait view.

Negative 5910 pI am currently developing an application using the Canon EDSDK to access my DSLR that will directly print the shot images. The problem here is, that my code interfacing with the EDSDK works perfectly until my application displays either a NSPrintPanel or NSPrintOperation. If one of these is displayed using either the runModalX or beginSheetWith functions, and quit again either Cancel or Ok does not seem to make a difference, then the callbacks within EDSDK seem to stop working. I can still interface with the camera, download live view images, shoot images, but no action relying on a callback works anymore. An example code, how I call my NSPrintPanel is herep  precodeNSPrintInfo  printInfo  [NSPrintInfo sharedPrintInfo] NSPrintPanel  printPanel  [NSPrintPanel printPanel] NSInteger result  [printPanel runModalWithPrintInfo printInfo] codepre  pThis is how I invoke the NSPrintOperationp  precodeview is a NSView with some data added, info is obtained as above NSPrintOperation  printOp  [NSPrintOperation printOperationWithView view printInfo printInfo] [printOp setShowsPrintPanel NO] [printOp runOperation]  codepre  pMy thought is that somehow displaying this panel messes with the messages sent around in the current application. The Cocoa application templates generated by Xcode already provide the print functionality to my Application via the FilePrint Menu. If the print window is displayed this way, it causes the same errors, only if I display a print dialog outside my application eg. from Safari while my application runs, then it does not mess up the EDSDK.p  pDoes anybody have an idea, what the problem here could be, or even how to solve itp  pOn a sidenote if I take Canons sample application Camera Control and add the above code, it ends up having the same problem live view still works, any interaction with the camera works, but callbacks are not called so sending the take picture command even works the shutter, but since the camera is waiting for the computer to download the shot image, no shutter release after that works.p

Negative 5910 pIve implemented a variant of the very cunning answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9233176uniqueidsinknockoutjstemplates9235013herea for generating unique IDs for inputs and corresponding labels in my Knockout markup. My end goal is clickable labels, not unique IDs per se  I had previously been using a click binding on each label which navigated the DOM to select its input, but that seemed breaky and inefficient.p  pHowever the solution linked doesnt work for radio button groups where each radio in the group binds back to the same observable. In my case my radio groups are either true  false binding back to a boolean observable or represent an enum, in which case the observable holds an integer value. The solution as provided results in all of the radios in a group and their corresponding label for attributes getting the same ID.p  pTo make matters more complex, these radio button sets themselves appear multiple times. For example, there might be 10 templated divs each with a set of 3 radio buttons Red, Green, Blue  each radio having a label which I want to activate the corresponding radio on click.p  pIve been struggling to modify this solution to suit, but my brain has now locked up. Any ideas welcomep

Negative 5910 pI am working on an email validation link for a website.  When a user registers and finishes filling in their personal data and it passes all the checks, they are sent to a jsp page saying that an email has been sent to the address they entered as the username, with a link to click to validate the email address.  So that part is all well and good, I generate the link for now just using my localhost and it looks like this as an example codehttplocalhost9999javaworkmscvalidate6FRQ8RATampu1s3w1Iih64egX01188HTcode.  When they click the link it goes to the jsp page codeindex.jspcode in the validation folder. At this point I need to grab the entire URL and send it to a function to make sure the URL is formatted properly for security purposes.  If it passes and the format is fine, I need to grab the 8 digit code immediately after the  and also the value of u.  I then send those values to a function that checks that they match what we have in our DB, and if they do, I update the DB record with a validation date so we know they have validated their email address.p  pSo my question is first, how do I grab the entire URL to check the format, and second, how do I grab the 8 digit code, and the value of u  I have been looking online and all examples require creating multiple functions or classes, and using the URL class.  And they all want me to make an instance of a URL object and initialize it using the entire URL.  But it is not a static URL, it will be different for every user that registers, as it generates a random 8 digit code to check against, and the value of u is the masked user id from the DB.  I dont understand how it can require you to initialize the entire URL in order to get the values, when you dont know what the values are until you get them from the URL.p  pIs there a simple way to grab the values, and the entire URL  Even if I can just get everything after the , I know the base URL and can build a new String to check the formatting if I can get from the  and after.  Please help with that part.  Thanks.p

Negative 5910 pIm working on a project for a math class at school, and I chose to do mine on the Traveling Salesman Problem, something Ive always wanted to investigate more. However, Im having problems with my brute force solving algorithm.p  pstrongPlease go to the update at the bottom to view the most recent version of the codestrongp  hr  hr  pstrongSKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM ISstrong To summarize as much as possible, the TSP goes like this You are a salesman who wants to visit each city in a region a city is essentially a point on a map. There are n cities in the bounded x and y region, and each city is connected to each city by assume a straight road. You need to find the shortest possible route among the cities that allows you to visit each city.One of the algorithms I want to use and I will need to test other algorithms is Brute Force, which checks every possible route and returns the shortest route. The reason this is not always used is because it requires us to check n1 possible routes, and that number gets huge as n increases in fact, with just 50 cities, that would be 608281864034267560872252163321295376887552831379210240000000000 routes to check.p  pemASSUME FOR ALL EXAMPLES TALKED ABOUT IN THIS POST THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE USING AN ARBITRARY REGION WITH 4 CITIESem even though the algorithm can handle n cities. also we dont care about distances we want to hit every possible route in brute force.p  pHere is a simple picture demoing what Im talking about 4 cities is what Im starting with to check if the process is working properlyp  pa hrefhttpwww.emeraldinsight.comcontentimagesfig0050300707002.png relnofollowpicture of map with citiesap  pHere is the Brute Force algorithm assume all other called methods work correctly, because they dop  pcheck below for a bit more explanationp  p[code]p  precodepublic void BruteForceFindBestRouteRoute r Must start r having 1 unflagged city to begin with              ifr.allFlagged ampamp r.route.size  m.cities.size                      STEP 1 Begin with last unflagged city             City pivot  r.lastCityAdded             STEP 2 Flag city             pivot.visited  true             STEP 3 Find cities NOT IN ROUTE             ArrayListltCitygt citiesNotInRoute  new ArrayListltCitygt             forint i  0 iltm.cities.size i                              ifr.isCityInRoutem.cities.geti.name                                      citiesNotInRoute.addm.cities.geti                                           STEP 4 Recursively call BruteForceFindBestRoute using these cities added to the end of our original route             forint i  0 iltcitiesNotInRoute.size i                              Route newRoute  r                 newRoute.addToRoutecitiesNotInRoute.geti                 BruteForceFindBestRoutenewRoute                               STEP 5 If the route is full but the last city isnt flagged, then flag it call BruteForceFindBestRoute again, with the last city flagged         else ifr.allFlagged ampamp r.route.size  m.cities.size                      ifr.allFlaggedButLast                              Route x  r                 x.flagLastCity                 BruteForceFindBestRoutex                               STEP 6 If all cities are flagged, the route is full.

So the program correctly goes down the left side. However, after it gets to the bottom, one would expect the recursion to jump back up to step4, which it does. However, instead of R having city A flagged and city B unflagged and then recursively calling itself on the new route containing Aflag and B, R now has all 4 cities included, and all 4 are flagged. It fails because it adds city D again to newRoute, recursively calls itself again, and in another method we get an array out of bounds error because there arent 5 cities in my region, but there incorrectly are 5 cities in route r A,B,C,D,D. p  pa hrefhttpi264.photobucket.comalbumsii191om3n0746049b90.jpg relnofollowHelpful picture of recursive tree structureap  pThe problem has something to do with calling recursion in the loop, or route r being referenced within a recursive call.p  pIf you have any idea what I need to do, I would SERIOUSLY appreciate some help.p  pThanks to anyone who will help me out.

Negative 5910 pIve been trying to solo this one myself, but Ive hit a brick wall. I have a collection of 6 different Google Charts all on one page in a jQuery slider. Everything is perfect when viewed in Chrome, but its glitchy inside FF and IE. In FF and IE, the first framed Google Chart is fine, but when you advance the slider to a different Google Chart, the legend, hAxis, and vAxis titles are thrown off. When the charts are outside the slider, the graphs are fine. Im figuring its some kind of CSS conflict, but I havent figured it out yet. Ive been FireBugging like crazy and cant get a solution. The one thing Ive noticed in the iframe that Google creates to produce the Google Chart is the consistency of the x amp y aligned by the text tag it uses. Its actually different when inside the jQuery slider. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. The first link below is the Google ChartjQuery slider combo. The second is the Charts without the slider.p  pWith slider a hrefhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentweatherconditions.phpcityzip05401 relnofollowhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentweatherconditions.phpcityzip05401ap  pWithout Slider a hrefhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentold.phpcityzip05401 relnofollowhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentold.phpcityzip05401ap  pPS...yes I did try a totally different slider and I got the same result p

I gobbled up some pertinent information pertaining to it, bundle it up, send an ajax call  then update the view. The thing is. My plugin could be called numerous times on a page. But the thing is I need to grab some data objects PRIOR to calling my plugin so I then can operate on them and determine what I need to update. So that is my issue.

Negative 5910 pIm compressing a binary stream thats made of packetsp  pA packet is composed of 256 32bit integers samples.

Basically Im using a control byte where Im encoding using single bits which nibbles changed from the previous sample  If theres a change, Ill include the modified nibbles on the compression stream, otherwise they will be reconstructed from the previous sample upon decompression.p  pHere is how the example stream I provided would be compressedp  precodeControl Byte 11111111      all nibbles change, since this is first sample Data         1100 1001 1110 0010 0001 0101 0110 1101  data for all nibbles Control Byte 00010001      only nibbles 3 and 7 have changes Data         1010 0101     data for nibbles 3 and 7 Control Byte 00000000      no nibbles are changing Data                       no data is required Control Byte 01010010      nibbles 1, 3 and 6 have changes Data         0001 1011 0010    nibbles 1, 3 and 6 ... codepre  pUsing this scheme, we have a fixed overhead of 256 bytes the control bytes, with an average, variable compresseddata length of 260 bytes the nibbles that are changing from sample to sample.  Considering the uncompressed packet is 1024 bytes in length, this is practically giving us a 50 average compression rate.   p  pThis is not bad, but my gut feeling is that a much better approach is possible.  Is anybody aware of a better compression strategy that exploits the fact that very few bits change from sample to sample  Lossy compression is an alternative as long as the  biterror rate after decompression is small less than 3  for this particular data stream, the numerical weight of the bit positions is irrelevant, so an error ocurring in the higher bits is of no concern at all.p  pThanks everyone in advancep

Negative 5910 pIm a beginner when it comes to Actionscript 3.0 for Adobe Flash CS6. Im trying to make a basic, plain animated interactive logo for a web portfolio, and have encountered a problem while trying to fix rollOver issues with triangles in the logo. With the current coding Ive learned on my own, Im able to get the animations and reactions just fine with movie clips instead of buttons. However, the execution of this method causes the hitboxes of whichever movie clip is frontmost on stage to play its animation even if youre trying to mouse over a movie clip behind it.p  pHere is the web page in questionp  pa hrefhttpinancarrow.wix.comhome relnofollowhttpinancarrow.wix.comhomeap  pNotice how when you roll over the left corner or bottom corner of the yellow triangle, the blue Games animation or the green Skills animation fades in and plays instead of the yellow Connect animation.p  pI have attempted to remedy this small but annoying problem by attempting to turn the movie clips to buttons, allowing an accurate response when people mouse over the shapes. The result is that all the movie clips that have animation play uncontrollably and loop their animations.

Negative 5910 pHi community experts,     I am developing an iOS application by referring sybase 2.1.3 documentation. In background i am connecting an iOS device using a native app based on SUP object APIs to connect to SUP and SUP connects to SAP backend. The MBOs are built from SAP functional modules. In sybase unwired workspace, I have created the MBO with operation and the operation type is OTHER and data source specified is SAP. Input  output parameters are selected and code is generated for iOS The operation flow is like thisp  precode   Instantiate header and operation    ITEMBAPICREATEOperation createOp  [[ITEMBAPICREATEOperation alloc] init]       createOp.itemNo   001     ITEMBAPIHEADEROperation header  [[ITEMBAPIHEADEROperation alloc] init]       header.itemQTY  [NSNumber numberWithInt1]      ITEMAddComponent  operation  [[[ITEMAddComponent alloc]init]autorelease]     [operation addComponentsWithMethodcreateOp withHeaderheader]     [operation save]     [operation submitPending] codepre  pWhile executing above operation it gives me the error as itemQty is NaN not a number though i am assigning a number value into the header.itemQTY variable and flow of program execution stops by crashing over  [SUPAbstractEnityRBS submitPending]. The same operation is working correctly on android side and giving error on iOS side. Please give me the valuable suggestions.p  pI will be very thankful if anyone could could suggest me what might be going wrong and how to fix these kind of issues.p

Negative 5910 pXcode is once again trying to drive me nuts.p  pToday, out of the blue, Xcode stopped building my OS X project.

What might be the problem herep  h2Updateh2  pThe problem solved itself after semirandom combination of cleaning, deleting DerivedData, relinking the framework and restarting Xcode, which makes me think the problem was caused by a hard to reproduce Xcode bug.

Negative 5910 pIm trying to implement a Tastypie Resource that allows GET amp POST operations following a per userpermission policy, the model is pretty simple similar to the Note model in Tastypie documentation and the resource itself is also pretty simple, I just have an extra overrideurls method to implement search with Haystack.p  pMy main problem now is that although running the project locally seems to be working fine, requests are fast and everything. Once I deployed the project On Linode, using Nginx, Gunicorn, Runit, I discovered that POST requests are too slow, taking about a 1.1 min to come back with a 201 status. GET requests on the other hand are working well and as expected.p  pI ran a Python Hotshot profiler on the request and its showing that the entire POST request is taking 0.127 CPU seconds. Im not really sure whats happening here.p  pI should mention that Im using ApiKeyAuthentication and DjangoAuthorization for my Tastypie resource. p  pHeres a screenshot from Chrome Inspector for the request a hrefhttpd.priCvCShttpd.priCvCSap  pIt would be great if anyone can direct me into the correct direction to look for an answer for this problem.p  pThanksp  pEditp  pSome codep  pModels amp Resourcep  precodeclass Notemodels.Model     timestamp  models.DateTimeFieldTimestamp     user  models.ForeignKeyUser     pagetitle  models.CharFieldPage Title, maxlength200     url  models.URLFieldURL, verifyexistsFalse     summary  models.TextFieldSummary     notes  models.TextFieldNotes, nullTrue, blankTrue      def unicodeself         return self.pagetitle      def getabsoluteurlself         return self.url   class NoteResourceModelResource     user  fields.ForeignKeyUserResource, user      class Meta         queryset  Note.objects.all         resourcename  note         listallowedmethods  [get, post]         detailallowedmethods  [get]         alwaysreturndata  True         authentication  ApiKeyAuthentication         authorization  DjangoAuthorization          authentication  Authentication allows all access          authorization  Authorization allows all access          ordering  [             timestamp         ]      def overrideurlsself         return [             urlrPltresourcenamegtssearchs                   self.meta.resourcename, trailingslash,                 self.wrapviewgetsearch, nameapigetsearch,         ]      def objcreateself, bundle, requestNone, kwargs         return superNoteResource, self.objcreatebundle,                                                         request,                                                         userrequest.user      def applyauthorizationlimitsself, request, objectlist         return objectlist.filteruserrequest.user      def getsearchself, request, kwargs         self.methodcheckrequest, allowed[get]         self.isauthenticatedrequest          sqs  SearchQuerySet.modelsNote.filter                                         userrequest.user                                     .autoquery                                         request.GET.getq,                                                paginator  Paginatorsqs, 100          try             page  paginator.pageintrequest.GET.getpage, 1         except InvalidPage             raise Http404Sorry, no results on that page.          objects  []          for result in page.objectlist             bundle  self.buildbundleobjresult.object, requestrequest             bundle.data[score]  result.score             bundle  self.fulldehydratebundle             objects.appendbundle          objectlist               objects objects,                   self.logthrottledaccessrequest         return self.createresponserequest, objectlist codepre  pGunicorn Confp  precodebind  0.0.0.01330 workers  1 codepre  pNginx Conf included in the main nginx.confp  precodeserver          listen 80         servername domain.com example.com         accesslog  pathtohomethenprojectaccess.log         errorlog pathtohomethenprojecterror.log          location                   proxypass   http127.0.0.11330                   location static                  autoindex on                 root pathtohomethenproject           codepre

Is paginator somehow making this acceptable, or is this totally memory inefficient If it is inefficient, how can it be improvedp  pAlso, a related topic. If someone doesp  precode   Model.objects.all[40] codepre  pDoes this code mean that all models are pushed into memory, and we splice out 40 of them Which is bad.

Negative 5910 pI am having a problem with a data flow task in an ssis package i am trying to build. The objective of the package is to update tables situated in our local server using a connection to a distant server containing the source of the data, through a vpn connection.  p  pThere are no problems for tables which are redownloaded entirely. p  pBut some of the tables must be updated for real. What I mean is theyre not redownloaded. For each of those tables, I have to check the maximum value of the date column in our local server int YYYMMDD type and ask the package to download only the data added after that date. p  pI thought about using a scalar MAXDATE for ex but the issue is, I have to declare this scalar in a session with our local server, and I cannot use it as a condition in an OLE DB Source task, because the latter implies a new session, this time with the distant server. p  pI can only view the database on the distant server and import it. So no way to create a table on it. p  pI hope it is clear enough. Would you have any tips to solve this problem p  pThank you in advance. p  pOzgur p

I understand that UIView animationWithduration... is run in a seperate thread, and seeing as i cant create iVars in the category i cant really use synchronizedsomeObject..p  pAny advicep  pThanks in advancep  h2EDITh2  pThe method looks like thisp  precode voidshowTopBannerWithHeightCGFloatheight andWidthCGFloatwidth andMessageNSString message andDurationCGFloatduration     UILabel messageLabel  [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, height, width, height] [self.view.superview addSubviewmessageLabel]   [UIView animateWithDuration0.5                       delay0                     options UIViewAnimationOptionBeginFromCurrentState                  animations                      messageLabel.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, SCREENWIDTH, height                                    completionBOOL finished                       [UIView animateWithDuration 0.5                                            delayduration                                          options UIViewAnimationOptionBeginFromCurrentState                                       animations                                           messageLabel.frame  CGRectMake0, height, SCREENWIDTH, height                                                                              completionBOOL finished                                           [messageLabel removeFromSuperview]                                       ]                  ] codepre  pp  pSo i show a banner from the top of the screen, wait for a duration CGFloat then slide the view out of the screen and remove. As this is in a category i cant add instance variables.. so what i want to achieve is that if more than one call to this method is made, i want the first call to execute without waiting, but each call after that to wait until the previous call has finished.p

Negative 5910 pWe are about to set up subversion for a development project where most of the code will be edited in VisualStudio 2012. p  pTo avoid people locking files, we would like to set up a polling mechanism so that a warning is issued to team members that somebody else has started editing a specific file. This warning will tell them that if they do make changes they will have to merge their changes against the other ongoing changes that are currently in the making.p  pThe only reference to polling subversion I can find with ease is a hrefhttpswiki.jenkinsci.orgdisplayJENKINSSubversionPlugin relnofollowJenkinsa, but that does not fit in a VS2012VisualSVN setup. p  pI would have expected that the use case to monitoring remote svn status changes to be common. Has anyone found a solution for thisp  pSetting up some form of polling, and perhaps including a special property to files on commit with or without a postcommit hook to triger changes on all machines may be more difficult that it appears.

I copied below the referred section from the authors home pagep  pstrong3.3.3 Resource Managementstrong [tour2.copy.resource]p  blockquote   pBy dening constructors, copy operations, move operations, and a   destructor, a       programmer can provide complete control of the lifetime of a contained resource       such as the elements of a container. In particular, a move constructor allows       an object to move simply and cheaply from one scope to another. That way, we       can move objects that we cannot or would not want to copy out of a scope.       Consider a standardlibrary thread representing a concurrent activity 5.3.1       and a Vector of a million doubles. We cant copy the former and dont want to       copy the latter.p blockquote  precodestdvectorltthreadgt mythreads Vector init      thread t heartbeat  run heartbeat concurrently on its own thread     mythreads.pushbackmovet  move t into mythreads     Vectorltdoublegt vec      ... ll vec ...     return vec  move res out of run  auto v  init  start heartbeat and initialize v codepre  blockquote   pThis makes resource handles, such as Vector and thread an alternative   to using pointers in many cases. In fact, the standardlibrary smart   pointers such as uniqueptr, are themselves such resource handles   5.2.1. I used the standardlibrary vector because we dont get to   parameterize Vector with an element type until 3.4.1.p blockquote  pMaybe my question should be whats the relationship between codevector mythreadscode and codeVector veccode inside function codeinitcode For instance, what would be the advantage of the code above when confronted with a simpler alternative like the one belowp  precodestdvectorltthreadgt mythreads thread thearbeat mythreads.pushbackmovet Vectorltdoublegt vec  ... fill vec ... codepre

Negative 5910 pSo I am using the following so I can change the on click color of my listview item. However, I am annoyed at what is happening when I return to my activity after the click  the color stays the same as when I clicked on it for about a second and then it refreshes to the normal background. Also, if I hold the listview item and slide my finger away, the listview item stays as it is continuously clicked on and does not return until I tap on another listview item. How can I only change the background color of the listview item on tap only and not have it stay the same after I switch back to the same activity Here is my code.

Negative 5910 pSo I am implementing an API in objectivec that I want to use then with unity. All the solutions for this task, calling objectivec from cunity, that I find around show how to do simple calls from c to objectivec using an intermediate cwrapper around the objectivec code, like a hrefhttpwww.tinytimgames.com20100110theunityobjectivecdivide relnofollowthisa or a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.comDocumentationManualPluginsForIOS.html relnofollowthisa. Nevertheless, these simple calls eliminate the objectorientation character of the objectivec API. p  pTo be more precise as to what I mean,  lets say I have in my objectivec API a classp  precodeinterface MyVectorNSObject  MyVectorcrossProductMyVector end codepre  pin order to call the codecrossProductcode method from the c code, the way described in the above posts, a possible cwrapper would could look likep  precodesay myVectorc is a c struct extern C void crossProductcmyVectorc v1, myVectorc v2, myVectorc vresult     MyVector v1objc[[MyVector alloc] initWithxv1.x andyv1.y andzv1.z]    MyVector v2objc[[MyVector alloc] initWithxv2.x andyv2.y andzv2.z]    MyVector vresultobjc[v1objc crossProductv2objc]     vresult.xvresultobj.x    vresult.yvresultobj.y    vresult.zvresultobj.z  codepre  pThis means that in order to use the cross product functionality from the unity, c code, one probably... needs to do something likep  precodeusing System.Runtime.InteropServices public class testScript  MonoBehaviour  ... import the myVectorc struct  [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportInternal] extern static public void crossProductcmyVectorc,myVectorc,myVectorc  and now fingers crossed... the cross product functionality is available through the crossProductc function    codepre  pNow this approach seems ugly and redundant to me. It would be really nice to be able to somehow have access to the codeMyVectorcode object and its already implemented functionality in the objectivec code in a more straight forward way. What I mean is that it would be really nice to implement the cwrapper in a way that something likep  precodeMyVector v1new MyVector MyVector v2new MyVector MyVector vResultv1.crossProductv2 codepre  pcould work in the C code, without reimplementing MyVector in c code from the functional implementation of the cwrapper. What I mean is if you could do, in c, something likep  precodeclass MyVectorcsh    MyVector v    public MyVectorcsh       vnew MyVector      codepre  por something similar but without loosing the object orientation because of the intermediate cwrapper.p  pSo searching a bit more I have found approaches to wrap c code inside c code using cstructs to imitate the objectorientation of c code, like a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkarticlesserversstoragedevmixingcandcpluspluscode305840.html relnofollowthisa. Without being 100 sure that I understand the approach it seems to me that this would be a neater approach to forward calls from c to objectivec objects. Not sure though how and if an approach like that could work for wrapping the objectivec instead of c inside c code.p  pSo my question is, to people that have more experience than me on mixing different languages and at the same time admirers of object orientation concepts, if an approach like that makes sense or if someone can propose another approach, because the design of an elegant way to deal with the objectivec classes from the c code has become a heavy headache for me the last few days...     p

Negative 5910 pI have a set of PHP projects, some of which depend on others. All have PHPUnit tests. All are installable via Composer, and specify their dependencies using a composer.json file. Each project has a phpunit.xml.dist file in their root, which points to a bootsrap file.p  pNow I have this project Foo that has a number of direct dependencies and several indirect ones. For the CI of Foo, Id like to run all its tests, and all those of its dependencies.p  pIs this somehow possible to do via Composer If not, is there some standardish clean way of doing thisp
Negative 5910 pWell, Ive got a site and brand new HTML5 tags to make semantic web pages. However, all the info is messed up in my head.p  pMy site hasp  ul lia header with banner and navigationli licontents block some promotext separated by small headers with tabs and tab headers could be more than one tab header in a single tabli lifooterli ul  pWell, I see, the main navigation should be in the codeltnavgtcode block, header  in the codeltheadergtcode, footer  in the codeltfootergtcode.p  pWhat should be a tab Is it a codeltsectiongtcode Or one tab has as much codeltsectiongtcodes as tab headers Which tag should be used for the tabs selection panel Is it just a codeltdivgtcode or another codeltnavgtcodep  pThe next headache is headers. Well, I suppose the site header which is in the codeltheadergtcode tag with banner should be codelth1gtcode. But what to do with sections If I have one section per tab, there will be more than one equal level headers and it would be incorrect to make them codelth1gtcodes, so theyll become codelth2gtcodes. But is it correct for section not to have a codelth1gtcode headerp  pThe next thing  the roles. Should I write roles for page header, content and footer banner, contentinfo, main, navigationp

Negative 5910 pDear Spirit Qi experts.p  pI have played around with the MiniC example in Spirit Qi, and have noticed an issue with empty AST nodes in the expression grammar. It will generate expression nodes that hold nothing but a single operand of type expression again.p  pI think the issue is due to the recursive rule definitions for the operator precedencep  precode expression.hpp     qiruleltIterator, astexpression, skipperltIteratorgt gt         expr, equalityexpr, relationalexpr,         logicalorexpr, logicalandexpr,         additiveexpr, multiplicativeexpr            expressiondef.hpp     expr          logicalorexpr.alias               logicalorexpr              logicalandexpr         gtgt logicalorop gt logicalandexpr               logicalandexpr              equalityexpr         gtgt logicalandop gt equalityexpr            ast.hpp  typedef boostvariantlt         nil       , bool       , unsigned int       , identifier       , boostrecursivewrapperltunarygt       , boostrecursivewrapperltfunctioncallgt       , boostrecursivewrapperltexpressiongt     gt operand ... struct expression      operand first     stdlistltoperationgt rest  codepre  pWhen logicalorexpr recurses into logicalandexpr, logicalandexpr will return an expression. Due to the attribute propagation is Spirit, logicalorexpr then assigns this expression to its expressions first member.p  pI think this is what generates all these empty expression nodes. I find that, however, nasty, and would like to get rid of them, but have not yet been successful. Has anyone found a decent solution to this beforep  pIm thinking it would be somehow possible if an expression consisted of binary ops and unary ops.

Ill wait a bit more for other answers look previous update and if I dont get one I think Ill accept Tolgas answer because his suggestion  to use vector is already done before which means vector should be less resource hungry.p

Negative 5910 pI think Ive pretty well got a hold on Dates now. So, I created a new object in a class and I assigned it a Date property, and I told it to print the Date property. It does, but just like it would normally do in C, it presents a Date and a Time. But in C, you can change that by something like thisp  precode Console.WriteLinemyDate  0d, myDate codepre  pAnd the d changes it to just a normal Date format without the time. Is there any similar way to do that in Javap

Negative 5910 pI have a some custom UIControls inside a UIScrollView subclass. The custom controls work by detecting touches to change the value of the control, obviously having touch sensitive controls inside a scroll view this can be weird is the user trying to scroll up and down or change the value of the control. p  pSo I overrode the strongtouchesShouldBeginwithEventinContentViewstrong and strongtouchesShouldCancelInContentViewstrong methods. In iOS5 and iOS6 if I set strongtouchShouldBeginstrong to return TRUE meaning the touch event msg is sent to the subview rather then the scroll view ONLY the controls work and the scrollview wouldnt scroll which is great. However in iOS7 something has changed who woulda guessed, the scrollview will scroll as if nothings ever changed but at the same time the controls also receive the msg. If im touching and dragging slow enough on the control it will work but if I move my finger to fast the scrollview takes over and starts to scroll.p  precode BOOL touchesShouldBegin NSSet  touches               withEvent UIEvent  event           inContentView UIView  view  self.touch  touches.anyObject  if [view isKindOfClass [MyControl class]]      MyControl control  MyControl view     if [control touchWasOnTrackButton touches.anyObject]          [control touchWasOnInnerButton touches.anyObject]              NSLogCONTROL TOUCHED         return YES          else              NSLogTABLEVIEW TOUCHED         return NO       else      NSLogTABLEVIEW TOUCHED     BOOL touchesShouldBegin  [super touchesShouldBegin touches withEvent event inContentView view]     return touchesShouldBegin   codepre  pDoes anyone know whats changed in iOS7 and how they solved this issue. Thanksp

Negative 5910 pIm working with a set of DAT files each is about 250,000 KB in size.  Inside there are many XML messages, each is small and on one line. p  pThese are aircraft movement messages. Im looking for EstimatedTimetoDepart changes. p  pI need to search for those XML messages with a certain node, extract this value and the values of some previous nodes that help me relate the message. p  pSo I extract the value for node EstimatedDepartureDateTime and the previous nodes for the carrier code, the departure airport... etc. p  pThe code Ive got works. It opens the file, reads a line, converts this line into an XML object. Searches this XML for the node. If found extracts the other data and writes into an array for writing out into a CSV file. p  pProblem is its slow. 10 minutes perhaps. Im not sure what I could do to speed it up.  It doesnt need to be JavaScript. Its just what I can knock out here on the work machines easly and I dont know other scripting langs yet. p  pSuggestions to speed this up are requested.

Negative 5910 pI have a simple console application that sends a number of POST requests to a server and prints out the average successful requests per second. The application makes use of the HttpWebRequest class to do the actual message sending. It is multithreaded and leverages the C ThreadPool.p  pI have tested this application on a server that immediately sends a response back and one that actually does some work. In the former scenario, a single instance of my application is able to achieve around 30k messages a second. In the later scenario around 12k messages a second.p  pThe strange behavior I am observing is that if I run multiple instances 24 of my application I achieve a greater accumulative throughput than if I were to run a single instance. Thus for the two scenarios described above I achieve an accumulated throughput of 40k and 20k respectively.p  pWhat I cannot figure out is why a single instance of my application cannot achieve the 20k throughput in the second scenario if a single instance of my application has been proven to achieve a throughput of 30k in the first scenario. p  pI have played around with the maxconnection parameter as well as the various threadpool parameters e.g. minthreads  maxthreads. I have also tried altering the implementation e.g. Parallel.For  Task.Run  ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem. I have even tested an asynchronous paradigm. Unfortunately, all versions exhibit the same behavior.p  pAny idea what could be going onp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe main loop looks as followsp  precodeTask.Run gt                              while true                                      throttle.WaitOne                     ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemSendStressMessage                               codepre  pRipping out the unecessary bits of SendStressMessage, looks like thisp  precodeprivate static void SendStressMessageObject state                       var message  sampleMessages.ElementAtrandom.NextsampleMessages.Count              if SendMessagestressuri, message                              Interlocked.Incrementref successfulMessages                 sucessfulMessageCounter.Increment                 QPSCounter.Increment                          else                              Interlocked.Incrementref failedMessages                 failedMessageCounter.Increment                           Check time of last QPS read out             if DateTime.UtcNow.SubtractlastPrint.TotalSeconds gt printDelay                              lock lock                                       Check one last time while holding the lock                     if DateTime.UtcNow.SubtractlastPrint.TotalSeconds gt printDelay                                               Print current QPS and update last print  successful message count                         Console.WriteLineCurrent QPS   intThread.VolatileReadref successfulMessages  lastSuccessfulMessages  DateTime.UtcNow.SubtractlastPrint.TotalSeconds                         lastSuccessfulMessages  successfulMessages                         lastPrint  DateTime.UtcNow                                                                 throttle.Release          codepre  pFinally, the sendmessage method looks as followsp  precodeprivate static bool SendMessageUri uri, byte[] message               HttpWebRequest request  null         HttpWebResponse response  null          try                      request  WebRequest.CreateHttpuri             request.Method  POST             request.KeepAlive  true             request.Proxy  null             request.ContentLength  message.Length               Write to request body             using Stream requestStream  request.GetRequestStream                              requestStream.Writemessage, 0, message.Length                            Try posting message             response  HttpWebResponserequest.GetResponse               Check response status and increment accordingly             if response.StatusCode  HttpStatusCode.OK                              return true                          else                              return false                               catch                      return false                  finally                       Dispose of response             if response  null                              response.Close                 response.Dispose                            codepre  pIf you notice above, there is a lock.

The only way I could make this work was by building the object for the JPanel class GUI right in the actionlistener for the JButtonp  precodeclearB.addActionListener                 new ActionListener                     public void actionPerformedActionEvent event                         GUI g  new GUI                         g.clearScreen                                                     codepre  pBut then when I called the method clearScreen, which looks like thisp  precodepublic void clearScreen         xs.clear         ys.clear         count  0         repaint      codepre  pNOTHING HAPPENED. Im guessing its because the repaint method wasnt working for some reason unknown to me. Someone PLEASE show me an easier, working way of doing what Im trying to accomplish here. Thanks Dp

Negative 5910 pI have a slight problem that I dont know how to solve. So basically I have a MySQL database, which contains various text strings lets call them tips. There is just one column called messages and in each row there is one tip. The aim is to display these tips on a webpage. But, I want the tips to change dynamically automatically. In other words, I want lets say every 10 seconds to change the tip. Also, I wanted the tip to be chosen randomly. My plan was to make a div, where every specified interval, the page will make an Ajax call, where a random number will be generated and used as the row number in the MySQL to display the tip in the div.p  pIn fact I was actually able to do all this. But the last thing I would like is for the text to actually change using some form of a transition, such as fading effect etc. Right now, the content just simply switches from one text to another. I guess the best way would be using jQuery, but I just dont know how to implement it.... Here is my current code, right now the text changes upon clicking on a button, but I would add the automatic switch later, thats not a problem. Also, the text from ajax right now is just static, not fetched from the MySQL, this is just for testing purposes and I know how to do that quite easily.p  pHere is the code of the page with the textp  precodelthtmlgt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquerymigrate1.0.0.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt function text  var xmlhttp     if window.XMLHttpRequest    xmlhttpnew XMLHttpRequest  else    xmlhttpnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP  xmlhttp.onreadystatechangefunction   if xmlhttp.readyState4 ampamp xmlhttp.status200      document.getElementByIdmessage.innerHTMLxmlhttp.responseText     xmlhttp.openGET,messageajax.php,true xmlhttp.send  ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltinput typebutton onclicktext valueShow classbuttongt ltdiv idmessagegtXltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd here is the actual Ajax pagep  precodeltphp     echo Y gt codepre  pSo in this testing script, when I click the button, the page makes an ajax call and the X in the div switches to Y, but is it someshow possible to switch the text using some animationp

Eveytime I receive a request in the main thread, it generates an instance of this class and the state machine starts executing until it reaches a  state where it has to wait for a response in the main thread in the eventhandler.

I know this can kill traditional RDBMS systems and Ive seen indications that this could be true in MongoDB as well.p  pFor option 2, it seems a little odd to have a primary key that would never be used by the system. Also, it seems that query performance might not be as good as in option 1. In a traditional RDBMS a clustered index gives the best query results. How relevant is this in MongoDBp  pFor option 3, this would create one single id field, but again it wouldnt be sequential when inserting.

Negative 5910 pI am studying up on EJB 3 from the book a hrefhttpwww.manning.companda2 relnofollowEJB in Actiona and this book in chapter 5 discusses about environment naming contextENC. It says this p  blockquote   pIf you know how JNDI references worked in EJB 2, youre familiar with   the environment naming context ENC. ENC allows portability of the   application without having to depend on global JNDI names. Global JNDI   names for resources differ between application server implementations,   and ENC allows you to use a JNDI location that starts with   javacompenv instead of hardcoding the actual global JNDI name. EJB   3 essentially assumes that all JNDI names used in code are local   references and automatically prepends names with the javacompenv   prefix.p blockquote  pI am not getting what is meant by global JNDI name Why does it have to be different across app servers p  pI am tagging the question as both EJB2 and EJB 3 since the quote references both the versions. Please feel free to edit if you think otherwise.p

Im not much worried about the other parts of the data currently, but the GCNSeqNo and Product Name. Since GCNSeqNo contains multiple product name for the same strength, I want to create a drug table with drugid identity, gcnseqno, and strength. I also want to create products table with prodid and productname. So far, I have extracted unique gcnseqno from the actual database that contains 60,000 to the new drug table. Then, I wrote a query that patches the product name with the same gcnseqno and similar name but without strength. p  pFor example in the database, the gcnseqno 034731 may have product name as INSULIN LISPRO  100ML in one record, but may have just INSULIN LISPRO or INSULIN in other records even though its the same thing, but it may also have a different name that may be a brand name B, for instance. The query I wrote makes sure the naming is consistent it makes all product name with the same gcnseqno INSULIN LISPRO  100ML if it starts with INSULIN, but since B is a brandname it leaves it intact. Then it uploads just the product name without duplicates, i.e., name before  to products table. p  pNow the issue that Im having is that I want to extract the strength 100 ML after  from the same product name. Heres the query p  precodeupdate padenialletters.dbo.drugs set padenialletters.dbo.drugs.strength   case     when lens1.strength ltgt 0 or s1.strength ltgt  or s1.strength is not null     then s1.strength   end  from select prodname, gcnseqno,        Case         when  CHARINDEX, PRODNAME ltgt 0              then substringPRODNAME, CHARINDEX, prodname1, lenPRODNAME              else substringprodname, 0,0       end as strength from paclaims1 as s1       where padenialletters.dbo.drugs.gcnseq  s1.gcnseqno codepre  pWith this query, what it seems is that as long as the product name has the same name and contains strength, it extracts it and uploads it in the drugs table. But, if there are two different product names for the same gcnseqno in which one contains the strength the other one doesnt, the query updates the database even if the strength is empty. I tried so many different things but either I get error or just doesnt work. It seems like I may have to join the table to itself and check if the strength is , but I couldnt even figure out where to join. Id really appreciate if someone can help. p  pEDIT p  pHeres another thing I tried p  precodeupdate paclaims3 set paclaims3.prodname  paclaims3.prodname  substrings1.NEWNAME, CHARINDEX, s1.NEWNAME1, lens1.NEWNAME from select P1.PRODNAME as NAME, P1.GCNSEQNO as GCN, P2.PRODNAME as NEWNAME       from paclaims3 as P1        inner join paclaims3 as P2        on P1.GCNSEQNO  P2.GCNSEQNO       and P2.PRODNAME not like P1.PRODNAME         AND CHARINDEX, P2.PRODNAME ltgt 0       and CHARINDEX,P1.PRODNAME  0   as s1  where paclaims3.PRODNAME not like s1.name and paclaims3.GCNSEQNO  s1.GCN codepre  pThis query is supposed to check the product name in the database and if they have same gcnseqno but doesnt contain the strength, then its supposed to copy the strength from one name and update it in the other. Instead, its copying onto itself where the strength is appearing as 5 MG 5 MG. Im trying this to ensure the strength is never empty even if the product names are different within the same GCNSEQNO since each GCNSEQNO must have strength.p  pThanksp

Negative 5910 pI am trying to create an accurate count of student enrollment.  There is an individual record for every course registration and any change to that particular course registration results in another record with an incremental sequence number.  My table looks something like thisp  precodeID    Course Number   Sequence Number 1     B101            1 1     B101            2 1     B101            3 1     C201            1 1     C201            2 2     E215            1 2     J320            1 2     J320            2 codepre  pI would like to select the max value of sequence number such that every course registration is retained.  This would mean that ID 1 would have 2 records.  One would be B101 with sequence number3 and another record for C201 with sequence number2.p

Negative 5910 pIm developing Salesforce iOS application. p  pFrom application frequently the user has to modify data which is available on Salesforce.com. p  pWhen user tap on edit Im launching salesforce login screen and prompt to enter username and password all the time. p  pSo I have decided to implement SSO using Salesforce Oauth.

Associated here means, for row and column i1 and j1, what is the event at row and column i and j. This is, the Final data.frame here should look likep  precodegt final.Df    X1     X2     X3 1  event1 event2 event5.n1 2  event1 event2 event5.n1 3  event1 event2 event6.n1 4  event1 event2 event6.n1 5  event1 event3 event7.n2 6  event1 event3 event7.n2 7  event1 event3 event7.n2 8  event1 event4 event7.n3 9  event1 event4 event7.n3 10 event1 event4 event7.n3 codepre  pnote that n1, n2, or n3 are arbitrary, can be anything as long as are the same in Col3 if the event in Col2 is identical. At the moment I have accomplished it using a series of codeforcode and codeifcode loops. However, I would like to understand the codeRecallcode function in R and code it in a much more compact way. p  pTo that aim I wrote this function p  precoderename.cols lt functionnod  1, j  3, init 1      generating labels to add     node.name lt paste.n, nod, sep        adding label to 1st row in each block      Df[init,j] lt pasteDf[init,j],node.name, sep      adding labels in col j while elements in col j1 are identical     while init1 lt nrowDf amp Df[init1,j1]  Df[init,j1]         Df[init1,j]  pasteDf[init1,j],node.name, sep         init  init  1          while the end of the Df is not reached, Recall the function again     using updated parameters     if init1 lt nrowDf Recallnod  nod1, j  3, init  init1     else printend     returnDf  codepre  pwhere codenodcode is used to create the labels to add to the values in col codejcode and codeinitcode is just the initial value from which the function starts adding labels to col codejcode. p  pAt the moment, this function returns a data frame where only the first 4 rows in Column 3 i.e. only those corresponding to codeevent2code in Column2 have been updated. The rest remain the same.  p  pThe function returns no error, and I positively know that the codeRecallcode function occurs. Therefore, I am assuming that the function does not work as expected due to the bad use of codereturncode or coderecallcode or surely both. I posted a question regarding to recursive programming in R a few months ago. But still I am not managing to use codeRecallcode properly. p  pTherefore, the question is How I should use codeRecallcode in this context so that the output is the desired data frame shown above. p  pThank you. p

Negative 5910 pI am trying to create a contact information system, but I am very stuck with the database modelling.p  pWhat I am thinking about today is having a person table with the rudimentary information about a person name, forename, surname, ssn, sex, dateofbirth etc..  Them I am thinking about creating new tables for things like addresses, email addresses, companies, phone numbers, nicknames, aliases etc. etc.p  pCreating these with FKs to the main person entry isnt a problem. But, example for email addresses. A user will have several email addresses for several use cases. One which is private, and one which will be somewhat connected to the company.p  pI am wonder if there is any sane way to connect the company email address with the company entry in the companies tablep  pI guess I could have an FK from the email address to the company table, but what then if the link shouldnt be to the company, but rather to some other entity Like an organisation, or an alias, or an email address thats only used in certain situationsp  pThe same situation would obv. also apply for things like phone number, postalvisit address etc. etc.p

Negative 5910 pI have seen a few others posts relating to this game, but none of them was centered around the type of algorithm Ive opted for, at least not in much details yet. This is also a pretense for me to learn more about graphs such as with the a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesigraphindex.html relnofollowigrapha package. Needless to say, I dont encourage people to cheat in any situation. This is really a learning challenge I set for myself  its often through those things I learn the most in the end.p  pMy plan involves some prep work besides the obvious collection of a hrefhttpwww.pallier.orgressourcesdicofrdicofr.html relnofollowFrench dictionarya. p  pFirst big step was to construct an igraph that looks like this, illustrating the allowed connections between Boggle letters. For those unfamiliar with Boggle, you can only create words from directly adjacent letters, including diagonally. and the longer the words, the bigger the rewards.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXzrUX.png altigraph built from graph.lattice, adding diagonals manuallyp  pThe next step which might not be ideal, but couldnt figure out how to achieve this directly from the igraph Package. Anyway, it was to generate all permutations using a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesgtoolsindex.html relnofollowgtoolsap  pcodepermutationsn16, r3code codepermutationsn16, r4codep  pand then using the codeigraphneigbourhoodcode function to validate every single permutation to see if theyd be legit on a Boggle game. We see from the numbers below that the larger the sample the longer the words, if you prefer, the more permutations are rejected. So its a lot of processing power to gain very little additional information. Clearly not optimal. And as r gets above 7, all hell breaks loose my 8 Gb of Ram are still not enoughp  precode4 letter permutations  total  43680                          legit  1764 4.0 6 letter permutations  total  5765760                          legit  22672 0.4  and so forth codepre  pSo now Id like to find a way to generate those permutations in a more sensical way maybe they could be called paths or trajectories, maybe with a tool such as igraph, so that I dont fry my motherboard for having too much fun. Working with graphs is new to me so it may be standing right in my face, but I cant see anything such as generate all trajectories passing through N adjacent nodes on the graph or something similar in the Docs. Maybe it exists but it referred to as Some Guys algorithm, guy whom I unfortunately have never heard of before.p  pIm pretty happy with the results once all that prep work is through. Its reasonably fast and totally accurate. Im just stuck with the 7letter words 5 miserable points hehehe. I might put it on GitHub at some point if ppl are interested. I think people who know about graphs enough should be able to point me in the right direction, thats why I dont think putting any coding in lengths would serve any purpose here.p  pThanks in advancep  pFor sake of completeness, once the valid permutations are computed, I run the resulting words against the dictionary entries and set aside the ones that match. Im using RSQLite and work with chunks of words of increasing lengths keeping things separate in that way makes the code pretty easy to follow and also makes db searches pretty fast.p
Negative 5910 pIm playing around with sharing a Core Data model in an App Group for a WatchKit app in Swift, loosely followingmimicing a hrefhttpsgithub.comaalittleCoreDataWatchKit relnofollowthis guys worka. Ive created a custom framework called codeCoreDataKitcode and put the .xcdatamodeld file to be a member only of the framework target Ive created a codeCoreDataStackcode object which creates and manages the core data stack, which is also a member only of the framework target. Finally, Ive created a new entity in the data model, and then used Xcode to auto generate the Swift file for that entity, which gives a class structure that looks likep  precodeimport Foundation import CoreData  class FlightStatus NSManagedObject      NSManaged var altitude NSNumber  codepre  pWhen I import codeCoreDataKitcode into my view controller in the iOS app to start doing Core Data stuff, Im able to access the codeCoreDataStackcode, but not the codeFlightStatuscode class  I get a codeUse of undeclared type FlightStatuscode error. p  pWhen I go into the codeFlightStatus.swiftcode file and make it a empublicem class, however, the error goes away. But this makes me a little uncomfortable  Ive been trained never to touch the autogenerated Core Data classes, because they may need to be regenerated at any time, and therefore I tend to add helper methods and the like in categories on the autogenerated Core Data classes. p  pSimilarly, I cant access the codealtitudecode variable unless I make it public.p  pAm I going wrong somewhere Is there a way I can ensure that my autogenerated Core Data entity classes can be visible when the framework is imported without having to manually add the codepubliccode keyword to themp

Negative 5910 pI want to write a game engine with JavaFX. In my current tests I am using a codejavafx.animation.Timelinecode as my gameloop.

After the frame has been displayed once, the same thing happen again.  p  pIs there any way to make a gameloop without a Timeline or at least a way to detect whenever the Timeline is lagging behind, so I can lower the framerate if that happensp

Negative 5910 pI wrote a Java program that uses the Data Extract API to create a TDE from a CSV file. When I ran my code the very first time against the csv file, I was able to pull 300K rows out and export a tde file to my computer. Since then it has never worked again. I had made some changes to my code after it worked successfully, but when I found that it no longer worked I reverted back to the original working code using CtrlZ. Still no luck. I put back my changes and have not been able to get a tde to output. I have been able to return a partial result back, of the first 1000 rows, as a tde, so I know my code changes work and the tde API is working. Where the problem lies is when I try to run the code on the full result 300K, it always gives me an error when trying to add a row to the table but only once, on a row that is a multiple or 1001 2002, 3003, 6006, 9009. The error is data engine error error code 204. But the code then continues going through the rest of the rows up until a certain point, when it stops printing anything out, keeps running, but never stops and nothing gets exported and no error is thrown. Depending on where the first error message happens the second issue always happens on the same row 3003 and 8866, 2002 and 5005. I have looked at those rows and found nothing in the data, I have skipped those rows and a few before and after, I have skipped the first 2000 rows, I have reordered the rows before they are processed, but the code always breaks on the same number it process.p  pMy code it output is this, The ArrayList of Field is simply a list of my columns with Field containing only the column name and column typep  precodeprivate void insertDataCSVTable table,     String fileName,     ArrayListltFieldgt queryItems throws TableauException      TableDefinition tableDef  table.getTableDefinition      BufferedReader br  null     String line       String cvsSplitBy  ,[][][]      try      br  new BufferedReadernew FileReaderfileName     int x  1     Row row  new RowtableDef     while line  br.readLine  null               use comma as separator     String[] elements  line.splitcvsSplitBy      int i  0             forField item  queryItems             ifitem.type  Type.CHARSTRING             String utf8Value       try      utf8Value  new Stringelements[i].substring1, elements[i].length1.getBytesCharset.defaultCharset, UTF8      catch UnsupportedEncodingException e       TODO Autogenerated catch block     System.out.printlne.getMessage                  row.setCharStringi, utf8Value                          i                          try             table.insertrow                          catchTableauException e             System.out.printlne.getMessage                          System.out.printlnx     elements[0]             x            catch FileNotFoundException e      e.printStackTrace      catch IOException e      e.printStackTrace      finally      if br  null      try      br.close      catch IOException e      e.printStackTrace                       codepre

A scene include several points of interest, each of which should be drawn with some marker square, triangle, ellipse, etc. The problem is that marker should be drawn in constant size despite scene transformations zooming in or out. So to draw marker properly I need to combine its position in scene coordinates and its imensions in pixels inside codepaintcode method. What is the most efficient way to do this Surely I can recalculate item position to view coordinate each time the scene is zoomed or the view is resized, but I dont think it is correct solution.

Negative 5910 pI can see a hrefhttpcodeverge.comembarcadero.delphi.firemonkeyhidingwithoutdeletinglistbox1047282 relnofollowother people have had this issuea, and the proposed solution is not working for me.p  pI have a list box with a number of static items populated in designtime, and in runtime, some list box items have their visibility changed. However, those items which are not visible leave an empty space in the list box where that item belongs. Its proposed to set the invisible item height to 0, and its apparently worked for people, but its not working for me.p  pThis is a common function I wrote to accommodate for thisp  precodeprocedure FixHiddenAListBox TListBox var   X Integer   I TListBoxItem begin   for X  0 to AListBox.Count1 do begin     I AListBox.ItemByIndexX     if I.Visible then       I.Height AListBox.ItemHeight     else       I.Height 0   end end codepre  pWhile stepping through the code, I can confirm that after codeI.Height 0code the codeHeightcode is in fact 0. However, the problem still persists, and theres still an empty void in the list box, as if the list box control ignores what height I set the item.p  pHow can I make invisible items truly hidden from the list box including this empty space behind it, without deleting these items My app has many different list box controls with the same issue, so a global solution would be ideal.p  pNOTE This is using Windows 32 as a platform.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI did a few more trials, and discovered something. In designtime, the list box items codeHeightcode property defaults to the parent list boxs codeItemHeightcode property. If I change the codeHeightcode of a specific item in designtime, it immediately reverts back to what it was before. So the question then becomes... why is Firemonkey reverting codeTListBoxItem.Heightcode every time I change itp

Negative 5910 pI inherited a Mirth Connect v2.2.1 instance and am learning how it works. Im now learning how globalChannelMap variables work, and Im stumped by a misbehaving filter on a source connector. In theory I can edit a csv text file in the Mirth Connect folders directory to update the globalChannelMap that is called by the filter. But in practice the csv file is updated yet the source connector filter continues to call a prior globalChannelMap for the txt file. What step am I missing to update the globalChannelMap Is there a simple way to output the current contents of a globalChannelMapp

Negative 5910 pAs part of a study, I use a website .NET to administer an experiment via a tablet and 4G WiFi modem. The experiment involves downloading a total of 70MB of images from the website as it goes from page to page, with each page downloading around 5MB of images each.p  pI have written an application cache manifest file dvams.appcache in which I list all of the image files and other resources which I wish to have cached locally on my tablet. In the aspx page using the image files, I have included the manifest attribute manifestdvams.appcache in the HTML element, as directed.p  pHowever, when I run my experiments out in the field, Chrome version 43 does not seem to take any notice of the manifest file, and the files do not persist locally on my tablet for more than a short period of time, after which Chrome behaves as if they have been removed from the cache. p  pIn every experimental run I do, the browser continues to retrieve a lot of files it has already downloaded from the website. The speed of my 4G connection varies markedly, and downloading these files time and time again is excruciatingly slow, with pages taking as long as 2 or 3 minutes to download the required image files.p  pMy theory is that the file cache size needs to be increased to accommodate the 70MB of files I wish to be cached, or that an offline mode setting that used to exist in earlier versions of chrome but did appear to work needs to be set somewhere. I have seen how a cache size parameter diskcachesize104857600 can be added as a parameter to the chrome executable file when called from Windows, but cannot figure out how to accomplish this on Android 5.1.p  pWhy are these cached files being deleted How can I force ChromeAndroid to ALWAYS go to the cache for images it has already downloaded, and make these offline files persist PERMANENTLY unless I manually tell Chrome to clear themp

Twitter sends up to 5000 friend IDs by default, and Id rather not arbitrarily limit that more if I can avoid it you can only make so many requests to their API per minute.p  pOnce I get the list of the friend IDs, I can easily translate that into tw AuthAccount key IDs, and use getmulti to retrieve the AuthAccounts. Then I remove all of the Null accounts for twitter users not in our system, and get all the user IDs for the twitter friends that are in our system. Those ids are also the keys of the RelativeUserScores, so I use a bunch of transactionaltasklets to add this users ID to the RelativeUserScores followers list.p  pstrongThe Optimization Questionsstrongp  ol liThe first thing that happens is a call to Twitters API. Given that this is required for everything else in the task, Im assuming I would not get any gains in making this asynchronous, correct GAE is already smart enough to use the server for handling other tasks while this one blocksli lipWhen determining if a twitter friend is playing our game, I currently convert all twitter friend ids to auth account IDs, and retrieve by getmulti. Given that this data is sparse most twitter friends will most likely not be playing our game, would I be better off with a projection query that just retrieves the user ID directly Something like...p  precodetwitterfriendids  twitterapi.friendids  potentially 5000 values friendsystemids  AuthAccount     .queryAuthAccount.authid.INtwitterfriendids     .fetchprojection[AuthAccount.userid] codepre  pI cant remember or find where, but I read this is better because you dont waste time attempting to read model objects that dont existpli liWhether I end up using getmulti or a projection query, is there any benefit to breaking up the request into multiple async queries, instead of trying to get  query for potentially 5000 objects at onceli ol

Negative 5910 pIm creating a game that offers 10 inapp purchases. Im wondering, is it possible to add discount to inapp purchases if for example 3 products were bought together I am currently in the process of acquiring international credit card for developer enrolment and I have no access to iTunes Connect myself.

Negative 5910 pIm newbie in Android. I am using a webview to load some MathML content. I want to make the webview act like a button, so that I can put three or four webviews and the user can select one of them by clicking on it. I want to make  the  webview as a whole, clickable, like a button. My idea is to put a transparent button over the webview, so that the user can still view the content in the webview and when he tries to click the webview, it would actually trigger the OnClickListener of the transparent button on top of the webview. Once the webview finishes loading with the content, I am getting the dimensions of the webview and setting the button on top with the same dimensions.p  pMy problem is that the webview is always getting displayed on top of the button.

Negative 5910 pSo the essential idea is to stall a POST form so that I can gather more data.p  pCurrently  I am working on an application to speed up testing on certain views. So I render one view, via HTML canvas element, the user votes on the view through a form and hits submit, and the form gets sent to MongoDB as a document. Then the page refreshes, which I know is best practice. p  pHowever, with this application, I want to loop through several views so a user can test multiple views. Ideally, every time a user would submit a form, a Mongo document will update with the users results, and a new view will be rendered through a function call until the final view is called, but this is hindered because I am not too sure how to deal with the response. p  pMy form.jade filep  precodeblock content     .container         .well             form.formhorizontalnameresultSubmit methodpost actioncreate                 fieldset                     legend PDF Metrology                     .formgroup                         label.colmd2.controllabelforName Name                         .colmd10                             inputNamenameName valuename typetext placeholderJohn Smith required.formcontrol.inputlg                     .formgroup                         label.colmd2.controllabelforselectbasic Select One                         .colmd10                             selectselectbasicnamebetterpdf.formcontrol                                 optionvalue2 U is much better than S                                 optionvalue1 U is better than S                                 optionvalue0 U is the same as S                                 optionvalue1 S is better than U                                 optionvalue2 S is much better than U                     .formgroup                         label.colmd2.controllabelforprintS Is S good enough to print                         .colmd10                             label.radioinlineforradios1                                 inputradios1typeradio nameprintS value1 checkedchecked                                  Yes                             label.radioinlineforradios0                                 inputradios0typeradio nameprintS value0                                  No                     .formgroup                         .colmd10.colmdoffset2                         .pullright                             buttontypesubmit.btn.btnprimary Submit codepre  pMy form handling post which is used through an app.js filep  precode POST form  router.post, functionreq,res      console.logreq.body      MongoClient.connecturl, function err, db          assert.equalnull,err          console.logreq.body          var collection  db.collectionpdfmodels         var doc  req.body          collection.insertOnedoc, functionerr, result              assert.equalerr,null             console.logInserted a document   JSON.stringifydoc             db.close                    res.sendIt worked   codepre

Negative 5910 pIm using Spring Data Rest and Spring Hateoas, with a mix of exposed SDR repositories and custom controllers producing a JSON HAL API. p  pIve written a number of custom controllers that for the most part just generate a codeProjectioncode of a domain object via the codeProjectionFactorycode and then wrap it up in a codeResourcecode with a couple of custom links added. p  pThis was working just fine, and was a far neater solution than creating custom codeResourceAssemblercodes for every class andor codeResourceSupportcode DTOs. I was using this approach as I dont want to export all of my Spring Data repositories, and I also dont want SDR to attempt to embed all of the associated resources of my domain object that dont have exported repositories, which is the default behaviour. p  pSince the 2.4.0 release of Spring Data Rest and 0.19.0 of Hateoas, it appears Spring Data now tries to add all association links to the projected resource via the codeLinkCollectingAssociationHandlercode, traversing the properties of the underlying domain object rather than the properties of the codeProjectioncode interface. This basically blows everything up as not all of the SDR repositories are exported, leading to it attempting to add duplicate association links. p  pHeres a simplified version of a controller class and methodp  precodeBasePathAwareController Slf4j public class CustomerAccountController  Autowired private SpelAwareProxyProjectionFactory factory  Autowired private AccountRepository accountRepository  RequestMappingvalue  accountsid,method  RequestMethod.GET public ResponseEntityltResourceltCustomerAccountProjectiongtgt getAccountPathVariableidLong id                 Account account  accountRepository.findOneid                 CustomerAccountProjection projection  factory.createProjectionCustomerAccountProjection.class, account                 Link selfRel linkTomethodOnCustomerAccountController.class.getAccount.withSelfRel                 ResourceltCustomerAccountProjectiongt tResource  new Resourceltgtprojection, selfRel                 return new ResponseEntityltgttResource, HttpStatus.OK codepre  pWhich now results in ap  pcodeHttpMessageNotWritableException Could not write content Detected multiple association links with same relation type Disambiguate association ...codep  pI dont want to export the SDR repository as I want to restrict the returned response to a specific projection, Im also not going to export all of my repositories which SDR does not handle nicely and I have some custom security and logging etc which Ive excluded from the snippet above. p  pIs there any way to stop SDR from interfering with my response Is there an easier way to achieve something equivalent to the abovep

Negative 5910 pI have a WPF DataGrid bound to an codeObservableCollectioncode in my view model. I have context menu action to duplicate the row up or down, that is, insert a new row with the same content above or below the currentlyselected row. This all works well and good, but the newlyinserted row seems to be a copy of the other one. Modifying one also modifies its duplicate. This isnt what I want I want each row to be separate. Here is my code in the view model to duplicate the row downward p  precode    private void DuplicateDownward              CPWrapper row  GetSelectedRow         if row  null             return          Channels.InsertSelectedRow  1, new CPWrapperrow.InnerCP      codepre  pcodeChannelscode is an codeObservableCollectionltCPWrappergtcode with a readonly backing, using only Clears and Inserts, and codeCPWrappercode is a class that wraps around another object not important. codeGetSelectedRowcode returns either the currently selected DataGrid row, or null. p  pAs you can see, Im inserting a new object from the existing row, and its still acting like the same object.

Negative 5910 pIm exploring the command pattern, and Im trying to figure out the actual benefit of this pattern.br I have read the following article a hrefhttpswww.safaribooksonline.comlibraryviewlearningjavascriptdesign9781449334840ch09s08.html relnofollowhttpswww.safaribooksonline.comlibraryviewlearningjavascriptdesign9781449334840ch09s08.htmlabr And after staring at it long enough, I still fail to see the benefit of the implementation. Let me clarify what I dont get. p  pWe have the following command object p  precodefunction    var CarManager           request information       requestInfo function model, id          return The information for   model   with ID   id   is foobar       ,         purchase the car       buyVehicle function model, id          return You have successfully purchased Item   id  , a   model       ,         arrange a viewing       arrangeViewing function model, id          return You have successfully booked a viewing of   model      id                      codepre  pExecuted by  p  precodeCarManager.execute  function  name       return CarManager[name] ampamp CarManager[name].apply CarManager, [].slice.callarguments, 1   codepre  pThe article says that this is what we want to achieve  p  precodeCarManager.execute buyVehicle, Ford Escort, 453543    codepre  pThe explanation is what I have problems with  p  blockquote   pTaking a look at the above code, it would be trivial to invoke our   CarManager methods by directly accessing the object. We would all be   forgiven for thinking there is nothing wrong with thistechnically,   its completely valid JavaScript. There are however scenarios in which   this may be disadvantageous.p      pFor example, imagine if the core API behind the CarManager changed.   This would require all objects directly accessing these methods within   our application to also be modified. This could be viewed as a layer   of coupling, which effectively goes against the OOP methodology of   loosely coupling objects as much as possible. Instead, we could solve   this problem by abstracting the API away further. p blockquote  pstrongWhat I fail to seestrong is how this solution is in any way beneficial over p  precodeCarManager.buyVehicleFord Escort, 453543   codepre  pWhat do they mean if the core API changes I assume that they are talking about the interface, ie. the methods of the command object and their implementations. But if either of them change, it doesnt seem to change anything in how the method is called whether to use execute or not, both will not work if the method name changes.br Also, I dont see how the codeexecutecode method decouples anything. Whether codeexecutecode is called, or whether the method is executed directly, the calling object needs a reference to the command object anyway.br Also, in the article see visual scheme, they mention a client, receiver, invoker and command object. In the example, I only see two objects .  p  pCan someone enlighten me p
