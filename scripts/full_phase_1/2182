Positive 2182 pI am working on precourse material for a coding boot camp. So, Im looking for guidance, not the answer. Im at a loss for how to approach this question. There is an HTML file that checks each step of the answer. With the code, Ive currently written below, I keep getting this response expected  to have a property push and the same error for pop. I believe I am adding the methods incorrectly. But I couldnt find any other way to add a method besides using prototype, which applies the method to all Array objects. I also tried doing simple tests which also failed.  p  precode returns an empty array object. this object should have the following    methods  pushval adds val to the end of the array  pop removes a value from the end and returns it  the goal of this problem is to reverse engineer what array methods are actually doing and return an object that has those methods function createArray      CODE HERE     var array  []     array.push  functionval          array[array.length]  val         return array             array.pop  function         return array[array.length1]        createArray console.logarray.pushhey codepre  pAnd the error messagep  precodeconsole.logarray.pushhey              ReferenceError array is not defined     at Object.ltanonymousgt UsersFoxDocumentsProgrammingCodesmithprecoursepart1Level2Intermediatesrcmain.js6713     at Module.compile module.js46026     at Object.Module.extensions..js module.js47810     at Module.load module.js35532     at Function.Module.load module.js31012     at Function.Module.runMain module.js50110     at startup node.js12916     at node.js8143 codepre  pI realize array is a local variable.

Only when I declare the User within the while loop is a new User added every time to the codeHashSetcode. p  pI am thinking this is because if the codeHashSet add methodcode receives an object with the same memory address as an object currently in the set, it will only update the object and not add another new object to the HashSet.

Positive 2182 pI have a scenario where Im dynamically running functions at runtime and need to keep track of a localized scope.  In the example below, startScope and endScope would actually be creating levels of nesting in reality, the stuff contained in this localized scope isnt print statements...its function calls that send data elsewhere and the nesting is tracked there.  startScope  endScope just set control flags that are used to start  end the current nesting depth.p  pThis all works fine for tracking the nested data, however, exceptions are another matter.

Positive 2182 pI am using Angular 1.4.7.p  pI have an Angular directive that is sometimes turned off with an ngIf toggle.p  pInside the directive I have it watching for changes to an object in a service.p  pWhat I am having trouble with is that after the ngIf is toggled to false, then back to true, the directives scope should effectively reset.p  pBut the oldVal in my watch is being maintained after the scope is destroyed. Thus when the scope comes back into existence after the ngIf has been made truthy, the watch logic always fails to see any change between what it was before being destroyed and after.

Of course although it cant tell that the scope was destroyed, the local data the watch is manipulating and populating is empty.p  pIf I do not perform the check of comparing the old to new value, then the watch triggers additional logic too often.p  pWhy is the oldVal maintained even after the scope is destroyed, and can I do anything to forcefully clear it outp  precodevar module  angular.moduleSeFarmFieldsList, [ui.router] module.directiveseFarmFieldsList,      [FarmSvc,MapSvc,FormSvc,UtilSvc,     functionFarmSvc, MapSvc, FormSvc, UtilSvc          return              restrict E,             replace false,             transclude false,             scope ,             templateUrl viewsdirectivesseFarmFieldsList.html,             link functionscope,elem,attributes                  console.logStarting Directive [Farm Fields List]                  INIT                  scope.selFarm                   scope.fieldListDisplay  []                 scope.selFieldId                  WATCHES                  scope.ondestroy, function handleDestroyEvent                      console.log[Farm Fields List] DESTROYED                     watchgetSelFarm                                   var watchgetSelFarm  scope.watch                     function                            return FarmSvc.getSelFarm                         ,                      function newVal, oldVal                          if newVal  return false                         if newVal  oldVal  return false   lt HERE                         scope.selFarm  newVal                         scope.selFieldId  FarmSvc.getSelFieldId                         if scope.selFarm.fields  return false                          doStuff                     , true  [...] codepre

There have been many questions relating to the issues with porting the application  I am unconcerned with the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms241064.aspx relnofollowgotchas from a programmingporting standpointa.  ie Handling nativeCOM interop correctly, reference types embedded in structs changing the size of the struct, etc.p  pHowever, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions632831whyarepublicfieldsfasterthanpropertiesthis question and its answera got me thinking  What other issues am I overlookingp  pThere have been many questions and blog posts that skirt around this issue, or hit one aspect of it, but I havent seen anything thats compiled a decent list of problems.p  pIn particular  My application is very CPU bound and has huge memory usage patterns hence the need for 64bit in the first place, as well as being graphical in nature.  Im concerned with what other hidden issues may exist in the CLR or JIT running on 64 bit Windows using .NET 3.5sp1.p  pHere are a few issues Im currently aware ofp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions632831whyarepublicfieldsfasterthanpropertiesNow I know thata Properties, even automatic properties, dont get inlined in x64.li liThe memory profile of the application changes, both because of the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions426396howmuchmemorydoesacnetobjectusesize of referencesa, but also because the memory allocator has different performance characteristicsli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions270614net35windowsformsapplicationx86vsx64loadtimeson64bitvistaStartup times can suffer on x64ali ul  pId like to know what other, specific, issues people have discovered in the JIT on 64bit Windows, and also if there are any workarounds for performance.p  pThank you allp  pEDITp  pJust to clarify p  pI am aware that trying to optimize early is often bad.  I am aware that second guessing the system is often bad.  I also know that portability to 64bit has its own issues  we run and test on 64bit systems daily to help with this.  etc.p  pMy application, however, is not your typical business application.  Its a scientific software application.  We have many processes that sit using 100 CPU on all of the cores its highly threaded for hours at a time.  p  pI spend a LOT of time profiling the application, and that makes a huge difference.  However, most profilers disable many features of the JIT, so the small details in things like memory allocation, inlining in the JIT, etc, can be very difficult to pin down when youre running under a profiler.  Hence my need for the question.p

The problem results from the fact that UserControl code namely the Initialize, ReadProperties, Resize, and WriteProperties events can execute at unexpected times.  If the code in these events relies on other code to initialize any of its data structures, theres a good chance its going to fail because that initialization code may not have executed.

Negative 2182 pI have a Pygame program that needs text input. The way it does this is to get keyboard input and when a key is pressed it renders that key so it is added to the screen. Essentially it acts like a text field. The problem is, when you hold shift it doesnt do anything. I realize this is because the program ignores shift input and instead writes the text if its number is under 128. I have thought of setting a variable when shift is pressed then capitalizing if it was true, but string capitalization only woks on letters, not things like numbers or semicolons. Is there maybe a number I can add to the ASCII number typed to modify it if shift is pressed, or something elsebr strongEditstrongbr Essentially, I just want to know if there is a number to add to ascii characters to make it seem like they were typed with shift held down. After reading over my original question it seemed slightly obscure.p
Negative 2182 pI want to change the imposed Windows maximum width that a window can be resized to, for an external applications window not my CWinForms programs window.p  pThe documentation of GetSystemMetrics for SMCXMAXTRACK says The default maximum width of a window that has a caption and sizing borders, in pixels. This metric refers to the entire desktop. The user cannot drag the window frame to a size larger than these dimensions. A window can override this value by processing the WMGETMINMAXINFO message.p  pIs there a way to modify this SMCXMAXTRACK value either system wide or for one particular window, without processing the WMGETMINMAXINFO message Maybe an undocumented function, a registry setting, etc.p  pOr The documentation for MINMAXINFO.ptMaxTrackSize says This value is based on the size of the virtual screen and can be obtained programmatically from the system metrics SMCXMAXTRACK  and SMCYMAXTRACK.

Negative 2182 pI have run across the following pattern a few times while developing Perl modules that use codeAUTOLOADcode or other subroutine dispatch techniquesp  precodesub AUTOLOAD      my self  [0]      my code  selfgtfigureoutcoderef AUTOLOAD       goto ampcode  codepre  pThis works fine, and codecallercode sees the correct scope.p  pNow what I would like to do is to locally set codecode equal to codeselfcode during the execution of codeampcodecode.  Which would be something like thisp  precodesub AUTOLOAD      my self  [0]      my code  selfgtfigureoutcoderef AUTOLOAD       local   self       and now the question is how to call ampcode       goto ampcode   wont work since local scope changes will                       be unrolled before the goto       ampcode   will preserve the local, but caller will report an                 additional stack frame    codepre  pSolutions that involve wrapping codecallercode are not acceptable due to performance and dependency issues.  So that seems to rule out the second option.  p  pMoving back to the first, the only way to prevent the new value of codecode from going out of scope during the codegotocode would be to either not localize the change not a viable option or to implement some sort of codeuplevellocalcode or codegotowithlocalcode.  p  pI have played around with all sorts of permutations involving codePadWalkercode, codeSubUplevelcode, codeScopeUppercode, codeBHooksEndOfScopecode and others, but have not been able to come up with a robust solution that cleans up codecode at the right time, and does not wrap codecallercode.p  pHas anyone found a pattern that works in this casep  pthe SO question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions200578howcanilocalizeperlvariablesinadifferentstackframehttpstackoverflow.comquestions200578howcanilocalizeperlvariablesinadifferentstackframea is related, but preserving codecallercode was not a requirement, and ultimately the answer there was to use a different approach, so that solution is not helpful in this casep

Negative 2182 pI have an User Entity class that Im trying to do password hashing for. I thought that the easiest way to do this would be to create a password field annotated with Transient and a hashed password field that is set just before the object is persisted with a method annotated with PrePersist and PreUpdate.p  pSo I have something like thisp  precodeTransient private String password  private String hashedPassword  PrePersist PreUpdate private void hashPassword      ifpassword  null          hashedPassword  PasswordHasher.hashPasswordpassword       codepre  pThis works perfectly fine when an entity is persisted. The password field is still set by the time hashPassword is called, and a value for hashedPassword is calculated and stored. p  pHowever, the same isnt true for an update  even if a new value for password is set just before merging the entity, the field is null by the time hashPassword is called. Why is this Shouldnt the values of transient fields stick around at least until the entity is persisted p  pIm using EclipseLink 2.0.0 btw, if it makes any differencep

Negative 2182 pI have very strange issue. In my WP7 app I have a pivot control and an item template defined inside itor in the resources, I have tried both ways, but still same issue. In the template I have a regular button with EventToCommand definedEventNameClick. I also have the same copypasted button outside the Pivot. The problem is that the button, which is outside the pivot is working ok, but the one inside doesnt work. Actually I have noticed, that any command inside my pivot doesnt work. I am handling correctly the Command in the ViewModel, because the same button, but outside the pivot is working great.  Any ideas what might be the problem Help, please.  Thanks in advance.

Negative 2182 pIve always worked with web application and thats what I like to do.  For my OOP course my professor decided to impose me the use of Java. Ive always used java to make console application so thats not a problem.p  pWhat is the problem The problem is Ive never developed a GUI for desktop application so I was looking for tutorials. Ive found some very interesting tutorial but there is something that I cant find there.p  pOk, let me explain. As a support framework to write my thesis Ive used the Flex 3 version of PureMVC. Flex 3 has something really cool you can separate your interface structure from your interface coding. You write the structure in mxml which is an HTMLlike language and you can even add style using a CSSlike language. When you add events, you write in a separate class in AS3 the coding for that event.p  pIs there something similar for Swing Or if not Swing is there for Java a GUI library that allows itp  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks for your answers, Im still evaluating your solutions.p

Im applying XOR to the characters with FF reversing all the bits and Im doing that by converting the string to a byte array then applying the XOR to it.

Negative 2182 pThis is probably a very stupid math question, but i cant seem to figure it out. What i have is a circle at point A that i can click on and drag the mouse oway from it. When the mouse is released  the release point B is considered a target point and the ball has to move in that direction. What im doing now is something like thisp  precodevelocityX  b.x  a.x  somenumber velocityY  b.y  a.y  somenumber codepre  pThis allows me to use different shot speeds the further away the mouse is released from the circle. But now i realised that i dont like this idea and instead i want to do it the following wayp  ul lito have a minimum and maximum speed pixels per animation frameli lito select the speed from this interval prior to the shotli lito use the point B simply for easier targeting. The shot speed is preselected and it shouldt depend on how far the mouse is releasedli ul  pI know it should be dead simple, but how do i knowing point A and B coordinates, min, max and selected velocity set x and y velocities to the circle taking into account the direction of the shotp

Negative 2182 pIm developing a custom control which shows an inline popup window and I would like to use a similar technique as the TabControl employes so that only popup windows that are selected within the designer or more commonly by placing the cursor within the popup declaration in XAML that it is visualized right within the desiger without having to run the application or change any runtime values by hand.p  pIve started by duplicating the implementation of the TabControl which I have successfully mimicking everything but it is all copied from Reflector output and Stylesnooper. Ive renamed all of the control parts and then replaced the default templates so that the main control uses an ItemsPresenter instead of a ContentPresenter to show the individual popup controls within a Grid panel overlayed on top of one another. So far this is working great too. The problem is that somewhere along the line I lost the ability to have the designer follow the item that is selected in the XAML editor.p  pEither an explanation of how the TabControls design time behavior functionality actually works to describe the selected TabItem behavior that I described above or just some pointers on how one could achieve what Im tryign to do would be great.p

Im building a little recipe application and have already made dozens of layouts, drawable resources, menus, etc., not to mention Java source code. p  pAndroid does not allow subfolders for resources, so is there a way to organize them Right now Im trying to organize them through naming conventions e.g. inewlistingredientediti but Im wondering if there is a better way, as the names will probably get pretty long and cumbersome.p  pSame thing with resources such as string values. As I understand it, I can create multiple resource files e.g. istringsnewingredient.xmli, idrawablesnewinstructions.xmli, etc. but all my resources across files have still have to have unique names, which again is cumbersome. p

Negative 2182 pIm writing a Java wrapper for an API and I have a fundamental question about SSL and HTTPS connections.  I know when HTTPS connections are made IN THE BROWSER, the information is encrypted between the browser and the server, so that the information cannot be read if it is intercepted.  Thats the fundamental SSL connection as far as I know it.p  pDoes that same level of security exist between a Java method call and the server however  For example, if I create a URL class with an address of  httpsserver.com, will the information between the Java code and the server be encryptedp  pIn other words, is the information being returned in this type of code secure directly from my API, returns a JSON stringp  precodepublic static String getJSON      String url  httpsnxtpass.comcreate                  apiKey  apiKey  so on, building up the query         return IOUtils.toStringnew URLurl.openStream  codepre  pIf I were to type that address into a browser, the returned JSON string would be secured by the HTTPS connection I believe this to be true.  Does that same security hold up in my code above  If not, how would I go about doing thatp

Negative 2182 pI have an interesting use case for a Solr implementation we have, where there are some fields in the Solr Schema that shouldnt be returned when doing a query. The ideal solution is to change the calling program so it doesnt query for codeampflscorecode like it does now, and only requests the necessary fields, but that wont happen in the short term so in the meantime we have to filter out some fields from the Solr response.p  pThe approach we think has the smallest performance impact let me know if there is a better way to do this, is to override the codeampflcode parameter so it lists all the fields but the ones that should be filtered out. For this, we added a new SearchComponent to the RequestHandler components list that modifies the codeampflcode parameter. The issue we ran into with this approach is that once we get the codeSolrParamscode from the codeSolrQueryRequestcode, it cannot be modified which is I think is the right thing to do, since it could be changing something another SearchComponent relies on. But we still need to find a way to remove these extra fields.p  pSo, this is the code we started to writep  precodepublic void prepareResponseBuilder rb throws IOException          SolrQueryRequest req  rb.req         SolrParams params  req.getParams         String fl  params.getfl         Remove the fl parameter from params and replace it with a new list         Cannot be done         ... codepre  pAnd ran into the issue of not being able to add to the codeSolrParamscode.p  pAs a plan B, that same SearchComponent is removing the fields in the codeprocesscode method, but doing it this way is slower. The code has to go through the resulting SolrDocumentList, and for each SolrDocument call coderemoveFieldscode, something similar to simplified codep  precodepublic void processResponseBuilder rb throws IOException      ...     SolrQueryResponse rsp  rb.rsp     NamedList values  rsp.getValues     SolrDocumentList docs  SolrDocumentList values.getresponse     IteratorltSolrDocumentgt docsIterator  sdoclist.iterator     while docsIterator.hasNext          SolrDocument sd  sdocIterator.next         sd.removeFieldsfield         ... codepre  pAny ideas on howif this can be achievedp  pThanks for any suggestionp

Negative 2182 pIm using Adobes a hrefhttpcode.google.compgaforflashdownloadslist relnofollowGoogle Analytics SWCa library for flex. What Im trying to achieve is to simply be able to utilize the realtime features of Google Analytics to know when users have my AIR desktop application open.p  pMaking it detect an open application was easy enough. I can visually see the count on Google Analytics getting updated in a matter of seconds whenever I open up my application. However, the problem occurs when I close my app. Google Analytics doesnt seem to detect a closed app and still detects it as open on the realtime view. How would I go with making Google Analytics know that the application has stoppedp  pSo far, it seems the realtime counter only reverts back to 0 after some 30 or so minutes that I have already closed the app. This leads me to believe that it was considered to be idle by Google and so decided to update the statistics. That might be good and all but I really want to utilize the realtime capability so I need it to reflect when an app closes with only a few seconds of offset.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 2182 pI have a function in my app that returns a cursor.  The cursor can potentially return many rows of data, and always returns 5 columns of data from two joined tables.  Columns 14 never change.  Column 5 can change based on user actions. How do I register a content observer to notify me when that 5th column changes from any row changes.  Here is an example.  In my main Activity, I callp  precodeCursor cursor  db.getNotifiedCursor codepre  pThis gives me my 5 columns of data.  Then I take those 5 columns of data and use a cursor adapter to put each row as a list item in a ListView.p  pWhen the user has not clicked on a list item, the background for that item is one color.  After they click on the list item, it is another color.  This is simply to help them differentiate between items they have already viewed, and not viewed.p  pThe 5th column can be null, zero 0 or one 1.  If it is null then it isnt in my ListView.  If it is a zero it is in my list view with the first background color.  If it is a 1, then it is in my listview with the second background color.p  pMy original way of solving this problem was to use a Handler that infinitely loops every 750 milliseconds that reloads the data from the list view with the correct colors.  I would prefer to only call that handler when the data changes because the loop version seems like a little hackish.p

Negative 2182 pIve done up a bit of code in which I attempt to integrate data tables httpdatatables.net with cakePHP.p  pIts up and running with my own app, but I want to make it more generic, so it can be used by anyone across any cakePhp application, and most importantly I want it to fit in with cakePHP conventions.p  pSo at the moment this is what I have...p  pA cakePHP helper called codedataTablescode, which takes the following arguments codemodelNamecode, codefieldscode, codeheaderscode.p  ul licodemodelNamecode is the name of the model whose data will be populating the table.li licodefieldscode is an array of fields we want to show in the table all fields must be prepended with ModelName. which means we can show associated model values in the tableli licodeheaderscode is a list of headers we want to be displayed at the top of the table.li ul  pThe helper produces an empty html table with the codeheaderscode as headers. The table is then populated by datables javascript you might have to read up on a hrefhttpdatatables.netreleasedatatablesexamplesserversideserverside.html relnofollowthisa if youre not familiar with dataTables serverside processing.p  pThe Javascript retrieves the table data from the codedataTablecode action of the controller whose model we want to get at. The javascript will also send the model name which we sent to the helper, and the fields. The controller then prints out the JSON data through a blank viewp  pMy two main questions arep  ol lipIt doesnt seem right to place the dataTable action in a controller. A because it doesnt actually need the controller because it knows what model and fields it needs to load and B because its not really a stronguserstrong action, its really just a JSON response. So where should it be putpli lipTo print the JSON repsonse for my codedataTablecode action, I use a codeblank.ctpcode view and the use codeecho jsonencodeoutputcode. It doesnt seem right to use a view to output JSON data. Usually views are just for the user rightpli ol  pOne way of answering both of these questions is to have a standalone codedataTable.phpcode file, which will print the relevant JSON data based on the model name and fields it receives. But this  doesnt seem logical considering the MVC pattern.p  pThe code is a bit messy at the moment answers to the above should help me tidy it up but let me know if need to see.p  pHope this makes sense to someone other then myself..p

Negative 2182 pi have a application which is handling lots of functions and also having lots of navigations.p  pI am using lots of BOOLs inside my application. I know its not efficient. So I want to remve these BOOLs to create more efficient and clean application.p  pThis is my question. For a Example lets say I have 3 UIViewControllers.p  pTest1 , Test2, Test3p  pI need to navigate to Test3 from both Test1 and Test2 view Controllers . Also if I navigate to Test3 View Controller from Test1, I need to execute one method and, if I navigate to Test3 from Test2, I need to Execute another method. p  pCurrently what i am doing is, I am Using Globals.h and Globals.m classes to over come this problem. I create a BOOL in Globals and enable that BOOL value in Test1 and, I checked that BOOL value inside Test3 and execute the method i want. p  pThis is just an example. I got lots of view controllers and lots of behaviors for the application. So I create lots of BOOLs inside Globals and used them in different Classes. So this is a pain to handle lots of bools in one application and it not good too. So can any one please help me how to overcome this problem.p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 2182 pI have a set of inputs and for each value that Im inputting I have a range slider and a number input. I have a little bit of JS that is called by both the slider and the number field using the onchangesendinputid, inputkind, this.value attribute for each input. If the slider moved I update the number and if the number changed I update the slider.p  pThis is fine for the slider as as soon as one moves it, the number starts tracking along. When one adjusts the number with the little updown arrows or types numbers the slider does not update. The JS is not called until another field is selected, i.e.. the input loses focus then it passes its data to me bindk, d, v function.p  pHTMLp  precode            ltdiv classnumberpairgt                 ltsubtitlegtXPositionltsubtitlegtltbr gt                 ltinput idlayout1slider classslider typerange value0 min1 max1 step0.01 onchangebindlayout1, slider, parseFloatthis.value gt                 ltinput idlayout1number classnumberbox typenumber value0 min1 max1 step0.01 onchangebindlayout1, number, parseFloatthis.value gtltbr gt                 ltdivgt codepre  pJSp  precode        function bindid, control, v                       if controlslider                          if console console.logIts a slider                 e  document.getElementByIdlayout1number                 if e                                      e.value  v                               else if controlnumber                          if console console.logIts a float                                    e  document.getElementByIdlayout1slider                 if e                                      e.value  v                                        codepre  pHow can I get a more responsive binding for using number arrowsp  pN.B. Im not just binding the two inputs to each other but to onscreen effects elsewhere so move responsive binding is desirable in that context not just the slider which I could live with. Also Im using literals to find update the paired value in my JS but literals will be replaced with a dynamic expression so I can bind a whole range of slidertext number input pairs.p
Negative 2182 pThis issue is VERY specific to the HTC Flyer. One that has been upgraded to Honeycomb or later. It appears that if Hardware Acceleration is turned on, then the WebView just renders blank. The background color appears and you can scroll.  You can even highlight text or tap links, but you just cant see anything. It is all invisible.p  pIt also logs a ton of the followingp  pcodeDGLUtils6612 GL ERROR  after drawQuad glError 0x502codep  pSeems like a bug with the Flyer, but has anyone successfully used hardware acceleration with this device and a WebViewp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have discovered that this issue is caused when the first WebView of an app is not hardware accelerated. Then, any further WebViews will not be able to be hardware accelerated, without this issue occurring.p  pTo reproducep  pCreate two Activities. Each activity can just have a WebView in it. The first activity should have hardware acceleration disabled.  The second should have it enabled.p  pIn the first activity the non hardware accelerated one, load a url.  The page will load fine. Now sometime after the page has loaded and displayed, start the second activity from the first.p  pThe second activity the hardware accelerated one should also load a url.  This will cause the bug to happen. The second activities WebView will display blank.p  pAlsop  pOddly enough, you can do the following and it will workp  pStart an activity with hardware acceleration and a webview. Load a url and after it has displayed, start a second activity without hardware acceleration.  Then in the second activity, load a url and then after it has displayed, start a third activity with hardware acceleration. The third activity will display correctly.p  pSo this issue only seems to happen if the very first WebView that runs inside of the Applications lifecycleinstance is not hardware accelerated.  It seems that if you do that, then any WebView that later attempts to be hardware accelerated will not work properly.p  pAgain, out of hundreds of devices that this app runs on, this only occurs on the HTC Flyer.p

Negative 2182 pI am developing a web app using C, .net 4. I have a grid view which is bound to a SqlDataSource. There are about more than one crore records of this data source. This is because, I have allowed paging. I have a filter criteria on the same page. User selects options using checkboxes. And then on the event of filter Button, I wrote some code which builds a new SELECT command according to the filter options for SqlDataSource. And after building a new query. I wrote another line of code which isp  pDataGridView.SelectCommand FilteredQueryp  pSo when user clicks FilterButton, the gridview shows the filtered data. As i told you, I have allowed Paging. So after filteration, when i selects the next button of that gridview, it shows the whole data instead of Filtered one. I think this is because it postsbacks the page and binds the  gridview according to the predefined SELECT command for SqlDataSource. p  pI tried many approaches. I used static bool variable to keep track on pageload event. It works fine then. But it still troubles when i nevigate from one page to another. When i come back to this page, it still shows the filtered data. p  pI have very less time. Please guide me as soon as possible. Remember, Im totally new to dot net technologies. So any detailed guidance will be highly appreciated. Thanks.p  pBest Regards p

I have an Excel source with these columns and more where an employee has entered their hours, and what type of work they have done, what division of the company it was for and so forth.. p  pSo for any given day an employee I could have multiple rows showing their type of work, what division they worked for, and their charged hours to that division.p  pHow do I get this into the OLE DB in which the codeemployeeidcode is the primary key p  pI am trying to use the aggregate transform to group by the codeemployeeidcode, however the codeemployeeidcode and codeworkingdivisionscode are not onetoone. Thus, the group by operation on both of those columns will try to insert the same codeemployeeidcode into the codeemployeecode table the codeemployeeidcode is the primary key If I do not include the codeworkingdivisioncode for the aggregate transform, then I lose the data.p  pHow can I group my data by the codeemployeeidcode, and still keep all the other columns with that rowp  pThanks for all the helpp

Negative 2182 pI am looping over a twitter feed and everything in my code works fine, but I am struggling with one thing. The if statement towards the bottom returns all messages that have a date for today. Then based on that I have a regex pattern I am trying to test for.

Rather than stating not found for each message how can I make it so that it will loop over the messages and if found state found it and stop everything, but if not found pass over the message and then once all the looping is done state not found only once.p  precodedom  new DOMDocument domgtloadHTMLFilehttpapi.twitter.com1statusesusertimeline.rssscreennamegoogle xml  simplexmlimportdomdom twitter  xmlgtxpathitem  foreach twitter as item      timezone  new DateTimeZoneAmericaLosAngeles     date  new DateTimeitemgtpubdate     dategtsetTimeZonetimezone     twitterdate  dategtformatF j Y     todaysdate  dateF j Y      if twitterdate  todaysdate          text  itemgttitle         pattern  sdsdi         if pregmatchpattern, text, codes              if issetcodes[0]                  echo found it                       else              echo not found                codepre

Negative 2182 pRecently I have tried DjangoCompressor. Its awesome and i like it too much, but i am having some troubles with offline compression COMPRESSOFFLINE  True and template tags.p  pI have  djangovars  and  djangotags  inside my JS code and i guess Google Clousure compiler the filter what im using with DjangoCompressor doesnt know to identify them. In fact, I think Django template structures like  if something  are deleted.p  pHow can i do to keep all this template varstags in my code JS after compressingp  pThanks mates.p  pstrongEditstrong Finally, i discovered all problems that i got using COMPRESSOFFLINE, they all occurred due to a bug. They were not about Django syntax inside of JS code. The bug always appeared when you tried to compress JS code inside of a file .html, not a external JS. It failed with all parsers and all compilerscompressors.p  pNow, although i like more djangocompressor than djangopipeline, im using this last one. At this moment, no problem reported with compression.p  pThanks to all who tried to help me.p

Negative 2182 pIm having a rather strange problem caused by both the facts that the android java implementation differs from the sun java implementation and that the base java classes are still included in the classpath all the way at the end during a maven build of an android project. I think the solution is to not have the java classes on the classpath, but I cant seem to find a way to do this.p  pBasically, there is a class called AbstractExecutorService in java.util.concurrent in both android and java. The java class contains a couple methods called newTaskFor which Id like to use in android, but the android implementation doesnt have them. No problem, Ill just implement them with a few changes such as using Future instead of RunnableFuture. This works fine in ant the build tool we are migrating away from.p  pThe problem is that when maven tries to compile my class which extends AbstractExecutorService, instead of just adding my methods to the android implementation when it doesnt find them, it continues down the classpath, finds the java methods and complains that the return types dont match. Ideally I dont think the java classes should even be available during an android build, since all they can do is cause you to think you can run methods which you really cant, but currently you can run all sorts of java methods not available in android and it will compile fine in maven. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions or solutions for this Anyone run into something similar brbrbrbr strongEdit

However, I want it to ONLY extend the android version and not the base java version.

Negative 2182 pI just started using SQLCLR for creating a very basic trigger... but while I did that another question poped up.. Is there anyway to actually make a SQLtrigger to trigger a method inside a webapplication.. My first idea was to have a web service which would be located in the webapplicatoion which the SQLCLR then called.. The whole idea is that once the trigger gets triggered.. it will call a SignalRhub which then alerts the client about that something happened in the database.. the whole thing is more experimental for me.. The reason I cant use the webserviceway.. is that it would require an additional request for each time the trigger gets triggeredp

Negative 2182 pAlright so I feel like Ill be sounding a bit confusing explaining this but Ill give it a shot. My site consists of two seperate webpages which ill call the main page and the menu page. At the top of each page exists a navigation bar with four options. The main page has several different areas which users can view which are shown via the nav bar and use of jquery show and hide functions. So basically someone clicks on the contact us button everything else on the page is hidden and the contactUs div is shown. Ive set it up so that if you are on the menupage and click any of the nav links except the one leading to the menupage it will direct you to the rooturl which is the main page. What I cant figure out is how can I execute javascript or jquery after someone has clicked this link so that after being redirected to the main page I can show or hide the proper categories.p  pSorry for any confusionp  precodefunction showContactUs                     contactUs.show                     forms.hide                     landlords.hide                     apartments.hide                     home.hide                     aboutUs.hide                      codepre

Negative 2182 pWhat I am attempting to do is set up a relative coordinate system.  What it does is take in the XYZ coordinates of point A.  Then it should translate that position over point B to get the position of point C, point B can rotate and translate on all three axes, but point A only translates, doesnt rotate.p  pBasically whats happening is you have 2 rectangles, one with the lower left hand corner being at the origin, and one with the lower left hand corner being point B.  If at the strongtop rightstrong corner of the first rectangle is Point A, then at the strongtop rightstrong corner of the second rectangle is Point C, and no matter how that second rectangle rotates or translates, then point C will always be on the top right corner of the second rectangle.  But if point A moved to say the stronglower rightstrong hand corner, then Point C would always be at the stronglower rightstrong corner of the second rectangle.p  pI have tried multiple times to evaluate the correct expression and what I came up with I thought was close.

However, this new widget does have a fair amount of complexity to it, so I want to keep it separate from the controller that normally handles this page since that controller already has quite the bit of complexity in it.

For example, if I want to get a random integer between a million and a zero, its going to fetch almost 4000 bytes... thats unacceptable.p  pApproach 2 sounds ideal to me, but Im unable come up with the algorithm. it goes like thisp  pLets take min 0, max 1000 as an example.p  ul liCalculate codeceilrangeSize  256code which in this case is codeceil1000  256  4code. Now fetch one 1 byte from the source.li liScale this one byte from the 0255 range to 03 range or 14 and let it determine which group we use. E.g. if the byte was 250, we would choose the 4th group which represents the last 250 numbers, 7501000 in our range.li liNow fetch another byte and scale from 0255 to 0250 and let that determine the position within the group we have. So if this second byte is e.g. 120, then our final integer is code750  120  870code.li ul  pIn that scenario we only needed to fetch 2 bytes in total. However, its much more complex as if our range is 01000000 we need several groups.p  pHow do I implement something like this Im okay with JavaCJavaScript code or pseudo code.p  pId also like to keep the result from not losing entropyrandomness. So, Im slightly worried of scaling integers.p
Negative 2182 pIn a voxel game Im making, Im using VBOs for rendering the world.

So I dont know how much space to allocate to the FloatBuffer and to the array.p  pI thought using ArrayLists but it seems slow and unefficient. Is there any way I can make an array or a FloatBuffer without specifying a size Or sending the data to the GPU as the vertices are calculated, instead of sending them all in the endp

The organisation may also want to use SSIS to retrieve some of the data.p  pI dont believe I can call the REST service easily from either of these technologies so I was thinking of wrapping the calls to the REST service in a .NET SOAP webservice, which I believe SSRS will be able to cope with.p  pArchitecturally this seems wrong, and Im sure there are some pitfalls waiting for me, but does this sound like an appopriate solution As an alternative I believe I could also write a custom data provider for SSRS but Id then hit the same issues when I came to use SSISp  pMany Thanks, Andrewp
Negative 2182 pI am working with hydrological time series data and I am attempting to construct Bootstrap Artificial Neural Network models.

Specifically I am making use of the codegetAttributecode method of codeMBeanServerConnectioncodep  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.5.0docsapijavaxmanagementMBeanServerConnection.htmlgetAttribute28javax.management.ObjectName,20java.lang.String29 relnofollowjavadocsa for the codegetAttributecode method says that it returns codeObjectcode, but what I have found is that depending on the MBean, sometimes it can return an codeObjectcode, and other times it can return an codeObject[]code array.p  pBecause I want to deal with the return from codegetAttributecode consistently, I have written the following codep  precodeObject attr  mBeanServer.getAttributeobjName, attributeName Object[] attributes  new Object[]  if attr.getClass.isArray      attributes  Object[]attr  create my array by casting the return from getAttribute  else      attributes  new Object[] attr  create my array with just one element   for int i0 i lt attributes.length i       deal with each attribute ...  codepre  pHopefully you can see the idea. Its probably a naive solution, but basically I want to deal with the return from codegetAttributecode consistently, regardless of whether its a single codeObjectcode or an codeObject[]code array.p  pThe above works ... for the most part ... but Ive now found a case where getAttribute has returned an array of codelongcode the primitive, rather than class. Because of this, my cast throws a codejava.lang.ClassCastException [J cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Objectcodep  pI understand the exception  it cannot cast an array of codelongcode to an array of codeObjectcode  but I dont know how to solve it.p  pPersonally, I think the method signature of codegetAttributecode sucks Returning Object to cover pretty much anything  an object, an array of objects, or an array of primitives  feels like a cop out to me. But its not my api, and Ive got to work with it.p  pAppreciate any thoughts or ideas on how I can solve thisp  pCheersp  pNathanp

Negative 2182 pIm trying to come up with what I hoped to be a somewhat simple workflow engine.p  pBasically I have an object of a class with a strongStatusstrong property. In order for it to advance to a different status it should go through a validation step. If theres no validation errors, status would be changed.p  pDuring the validation, though, I would like to allow the validator component to request information from the user or issue an alert message.p  pMy problem is that as of now the application is built as a Windows Forms application but we know that it will be necessary to have a web version of it. So, the validation will be the same for both, but each should be allowed to have its own way to request information or and alert the user. The way I imagined to do this is to use delegates and events on my validation classes.p  pHeres what I gotp  precodeThis is the class which will have its status changed public class MyClass    public int Status  get set    This class represent a transition from one status to another public class Transition    public int FromStatus  get set    public int ToStatus  get set    Common interface for all validators public interface IWorkflowValidator    bool ValidateMyClass object   This is the base workflow class with the main logic public abstract class BaseWorkflow    This holds all the possible transitions with the validator type responsible for its validation.   For example     var transition  new Transition1, 2 From 1 to 2     validatorsMap.Addtransition, typeofValidatorFrom1To2 ValidatorFrom1To2 class would be used to validate transition from status 1 to 2.   protected DictionaryltTransition, Typegt validatorsMap  null    Main logic for a transition   public void PerformTransitionMyClass object, int ToStatus        int currentStatus  object.Status     var requestedTransition  new TransitioncurrentStatus, ToStatus      Get the validator specified for this transition     var validatorType  validatorsMap[requestedTransition]      Instantiate a new validator of that type     var validator  IWorkflowValidatorActivator.CreateInstancevalidatorType      Gets the result of the validator     bool results  validator.Validateobject      If validation succeded, it will perform the transition and complete the execution     codepre  pMy main question concerns the validator itself. As I said, I need the validator to be able to request information required by specific transitions. So, this is how I have my first validatorp  precodepublic class AlertHandlerArguments   public delegate void AlertHandlerAlertHandlerArguments args  public class MyFirstValidator  IWorkflowValidator    Event used to send an alert to the user   public event AlertHandler OnAlert    Implementation of IWorkflowValidator   public bool ValidateMyClass object        SendAlert       void SendAlert        if OnAlert  null       OnAlertnew AlertHandlerArguments     codepre  pWhat Im thinking here is to create an interface with all types of events and implement those on all validators. Then my abstract strongBaseWorkflowstrong class can attach handlers for those events.p  pHowever, my abstract class cannot implement the final code for those events. Those are meant to be used by the interface and so far my abstract class is platform independent desktop, web. Thats actually the reason why I created this class as abstract.p  pWith that I can have my Windows Forms project to have a concrete type of strongBaseWorkflowstrong and attach events to display Form objects to request information.p  pAnother option would be to attach handlers on the base class and override on the concrete class at the UI level.p  pAm I going in the right direction How can I allow the validator to request information from the user at the UI level keeping some logic at the business layer so that it fits windows forms and webp  pI appreciate any input on the matter. Thanks in advance.p  pPs. Only after I finished writing I realized that Im not really sure on how to use this on a web application. I mean, a Windows Forms application can interrupt execution and display an input form for a user but that wont work on the web. Does that mean my workflow structure is only viable for desktop applicationsp

Negative 2182 pI just started working on a scientific project where speed really matters HPC. Im currently designing the data structes. The core of the project is a 3DGrid of double values, in order to solve a partial differenital equation. p  pSince speed here is a probably bigger concern then simplicity of the code, Id like to know how the STL performs compared to usual Cstyle arrays. In my case, since its a 3Dgrid, I was thinking of a a one dimensional vector with linear indexing b a vector of 3 vectors or c a one dimensional cstyle array or d a three dimensional cstyle array.p  pI looked up older questions, but I only found questions concering constructiondestruction which is not important here, as the datastructures are only created once at program start  fast indexing and computations on it are important or comparison of different STL containers.p  pThanks for help p

Negative 2182 pI want to execute the MERGE statement conditionally, so it wont try to match the entire targettable. My original statement was kinda like thisp  precodeMERGE [targettable] USING [tablesource] ON [targettable].[ID]  [tablesource].[ID] AND condition WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET [tablesource].[strField1]  [tablesource].[strField2] codepre  pNote assume strField to be typed as nvarchar4000, and condition to be something like [targettable].[strField8]  sometext.p  pBut then Ive encountered the following warning in the a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb510625.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa that dictates code...Do not attempt to improve query performance by filtering out rows in the target table in the ON clausecode.p  pSo my original query was altered to the following onep  precodeMERGE [targettable] USING [tablesource] ON [targettable].[ID]  [tablesource].[ID] WHEN MATCHED AND condition  THEN UPDATE SET [tablesource].[strField]  [tablesource].[strField] codepre  pThe problem is, that the query now takes a lot more time. Even changing the condition to be always false, such as strong1  2strong doesnt help at all. On the other hand, setting different fields, such as p  precodeSET [tablesource].[intField]  [tablesource].[intField] codepre  por any other types other than two nvarchar4000s causes the statement to be executed much faster.p  pTo conclude, the things I dont understand arep  ul liIf the datasetting of nvarchar4000 is the longer process, why setting the condition to be 1  2 doesnt speed up the execution timeli liIf the rowmatching is the longer process, why setting INT fields does speed up the execution timeli ul

Negative 2182 pI am looking for a way to launch another app from within my app but so that the focus is not changed from my app to the app launched.p  pI.e currently I have the new app launched via a intent, however when this is carried out the new app is launched and becomes the app in view, I need it to be kept in the background with my app still in view.p  pThe reason for this  I am developing an application for internal use that will act like a lockscreen to the device so although things must happen in the background the lockscreen must always be on top.p  pI have done some research into intents and launching other apps but can not find anything about what I need.p  pHope you can help thank youp  pCurrently the terminal is called like thisp  precode    Intent intent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONMAIN     intent.setComponentnew ComponentNamejackpal.androidterm, jackpal.androidterm.RemoteInterface     intent.setActionjackpal.androidterm.RUNSCRIPT     intent.putExtrajackpal.androidterm.iInitialCommand, cmdString codepre  pThe reason it needs to be running in the background is so that the app can run commands in terminal without the user having access, but then they unlock the screen they need to then be able to view the terminal and what commands are being run etcp

Negative 2182 pSo I think Ive fallen off a cliff in the javascipt scoping and prototype area. Im attempting to build a simple tree structure out of objects. building the tree is no issue, but when I try to get all the children, I cant seem to concat them together. Ive walked though the code and it seems like there is some odd scoping issue that is happening and I cant figure it out. This is the code I havep  precodevar Foo  function value      this.value  value     this.children  []   Foo.prototype.getAllChildren  function       var childs  []     for var i  0 i lt this.children.length i          childs.pushthis.children[i]         childs.concatthis.children[i].getAllChildren          return childs   var foo1  new Foo1,     foo2  new Foo2,     foo3  new Foo3  foo1.children.pushfoo2 foo2.children.pushfoo3  var children  foo1.getAllChildren,     expected  foo1.children.concatfoo2.children codepre  pIve created a fiddle here that shows the results of the code above a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nete2zf81 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nete2zf81ap  pThe getAllChildren function only returns a list with one Foo for foo1 when it should return a list of two Foo. yes Foo is plural for Foo. It seems to have something to do with recursion, scope and prototype scope. I cant seem to pinpoint my mistake and any help or my problem would be helpful.p

Negative 2182 pIm editing some source code for my college Transaction Processing course. Were working with COBOLCICS, and the program is a video tape rental system. We have a list of changes to make, and one item has me stuck its been since Fall semester of 2010 since I took the COBOL course, so unfortunately Im far more rusty than I should be. There is a customer maintenance section, in which the user can add new customers. One of the items for a new customer is the zip code, and as it stands it will take any input as valid input, but we need to make it accept only numeric values which I do know how to do as well as a specific format Either 12345, 123456789, or 123456789, and should only write to the record as 12345 or 123456789. Anything else, such as 1234 or 123456 will result in an error. How do I check these fields for the proper formatp

Negative 2182 pI want to add the current git revision number to the the binary built by codego buildcode so that I can do something like code.mybinary revisioncode to see which revision it is built from usually for troubleshooting later on after deployment. Obviously I cannot put the revision number into the source since that will change the source with a new revision. Im wondering if there is any other way to do this Or do you think this is just a bad idea If so, whats the recommended way to establish the relation between built binaries and its source version Version numbers do not seem to be a good idea with a distributed version control system. p
Negative 2182 pI have two sets of layouts, populated with buttons. Is there a way to disable any interaction between buttons of the same layout I just need nothing to happen when I click one button and then the other from the same layout. I tagged each button with  and , for buttons that belongs to upper and lower layouts. I have 5 of each kind. I have some interaction beetwen buttons of oposite layouts and thats working fine actually interaction works fine between any two given buttons and thats bad, but I dont want that interaction between buttons of the same layout.p  pHeres my game class, not all of it, just important parts. Also, Ive removed code for rest of the buttons, only left for 4 buttons, 2 for each layout, to save some space here. I import some text from sqlite database, and randomly set it to my buttons.p  precodefinal OnClickListener clickListener  new OnClickListener               private Button buttonClicked

Negative 2182 pGithub pull requests are a great way of receiving code contributions to open source projects, but whats the best way to pull them into your code basep  pA developer might say theyve got all the tests passing on their fork of the code, and a review of their code looks good but if you just merge and then your local tests fail youve got your repo in a bit of a state.p  pIs there some good way of running all the project tests on the code that you would get, if you accepted the pull request, without actually accepting it p

Negative 2182 pHow can I scale PictureBox components to best fit the given space on the screen while keeping their aspect ratio interdependent of the actual image or its SizeMode  p  pI tested setting the Dock of the FlowLayout and the PictureBox to Fill. I also tested using a Panel as a wrapper and tested different settings for AutoSize and AutoSizeMode.p  pTo give more information about the background I want to dynamically add and remove images in the viewport of the application, so a TableLayout is in the first step sort of to static. I have to admit Im was also thinking of calculating the size an position manually  or to dynamically adapt the row and column count of the TableLayout  but it seems to me prone to errors. I thought having a FlowLayout and automatically sized components should be the correct way  but it seems not to work that way. To speak as web developer, I simply want to float the images left, with width and height set to auto and no scrolling.p  pThe images should visualize this a bit the first figure should point out the layout, if there is only one PictureBox  it takes the whole space or as big as possible with the given aspect ratio. The second shows how I would like the Layout to be, if there are two three or four images. The third figure is showing basically a resized window with three to six images. p  pIs there some point Im missingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYV3LY.png altDesired behaviour of PictureBox components on dynamically adding more PictureBox components or resizing the applicationp

I just dont know which is done first, second, third, and so forth.  Does anyone have a precedence chart of shell substitutionsp

Negative 2182 pI am having trouble getting my PHP to work for my Apache server.  I am running Oracle Linux, and used codeyum install phpcode  codeyum install httpdcode to get my PHP and Apache.  I have scoured the internet and done a couple of thingsp  pFirstly, I have gone into my httpd.conf file and added codeLoadModule php5module moduleslibphp5.socode.  I have chosen to use the one in my php.conf file, which is the exact same one.  Furthermore, I have done codeAddType applicationxhttpphp .phpcode, so now my .php files are loading fine.p  pSecondly, I have tried to run my Apache server, and it works fine.  It displays my index.html file, which I set with DirectoryIndex.  However, when I tried to put php code into it, it got automatically commented out, which I assume is because I havent set it to properly execute on the server side.p  pNow, with all that said, I am wondering what else I may be missing.

Negative 2182 pI was wondering if I can improve the speed of my simulations with CUDA in Matlab by simply breaking up the loop into GPUthreads.p  pSo far I have done the loops with mclapply in R, but I was wondering, if I could strongspeed it up in Matlab with CUDAstrong Nvidia Gtx 650 ti boostp  pHere is a strongsimplified examplestrong of what Im doing I have a dataset of dim 2000x9 and I want to run at least 250 loops with moving data window ca. 1500 rows, these loops are independent thus perfect for parallel computation.p  pstrongExample of loopstrong Take the first 1500 rows. Some magic with the whole dataset 1500x9. Calculate univariate function on each column do 9times operation on 1500x1 and then run minimization problem with a certain loss function for each column do 9times operation on 1500x1. inbetween Im also working with all columns, so I cannot separate the columns in different threadsp  pstrongMy ideastrong If I would be running each loop in different GPUthread Does it make sense to do such a hard computational problem in single GPU core for illustration, 1 loop takes ca. 300seconds on i7 3770k on 1 corep  pI know that single GPU threads are much slower compared to CPU, but if all loops will be running simultaneously Especially since each loop takes so long once its given data, so feeding the data to GPU will take only insignificant portion of overall time.p  pImportant note Im a very lousy programmer, and what I plan is just splitting the for loop i in 1250 in function of variable i and passing this to GPU.p

Negative 2182 pSo, like everyone else, Ive been developing a game using libgdx targeting android os. Id really like to use my personal artphotoshop paintbrush as opposed to pixel art. Well, actually Im trying to fuse the 2 because we all know android doesnt accommodate enough memory to display some of the art Id like to use.p  pFor example I have many backgrounds that are 512x512 put next to each other to make up the entire First Stage, seemingly up to 12 images, and each image is around 100k.  This is taxing on the android and lowers frame rate dramatically, below 30 fps,  rendering me unable to add more images to the scene which I will strongneedstrong to do.  p  pQuestion  What is strongthestrong way to go about adding Background images and background Doodads p  pHow big in Kbsize should they not go over p  pIm loading them as a Sprite not a texture, is that goodbadp  pBackground images are saved as .png 512x512 8bit, is that goodbad what would be betterp  pDoes texturePacker do anything for performance, and should i even texturepack these files that are 512x512 and bigger  p  pBy the way I am not packing the background images...p  pDo I have to resort to pixel art and smaller image sizes to create a full fledged sidescroller on androidp  pI know there are a lot of questions, Im trying to explain my dilemma so youll understand it as a whole... Think of all these questions as 1 questionp  pIve been working on this game for 7 months now, knowing that id hav to cross this bridge sometime, I have ALOT done already, i would say the engine is damn near complete, meaning, mapgame editor, character mechanicsabilities, game mechanicslevel obstaclesthings to do, etc, goomba and boss mechanicsabilitiesA.I., story, foreground animations64x64, 64x128 images no problem i.e small file sizes, items, menus, ITs all ready to be used except im having issues with multiple big background sizes....p  pPlease any links, articles, tutorials are appreciated... Ive already gone far enough to know that if im doing something wrong i might have to redo alot of STUFF....p  pIm going for a full on 20 hour side scroller, what do i need to do in terms of gfx in a game that is this hugep

It looks like I am not able to pass jquery change as a parameter. Can anybody help me to fix this logic or suggest another way of creating generic function for such refactoringp

Negative 2182 pUsing Visual c  i am trying to read an image from the stream I do this by storing the stream in a buffer. I know that at what location in buffer i have the image.its the first file in the stream and i know the size of the image so i read and store the image in buffer until the size of file and thats correct.I am sure about it For the first time when i read the image there is no  problem it works correctly. The code is as followsp  precodeReadFromStreamIStream pStream   this pStream  stream contents the file contents         ULONG  cbRead         int size5348928         char buffer  new char[size  1]         HRESULT hr  pStreamgtReadbuffer, size, ampcbRead  here we store the stream in buffer.Now all the data is in buffer.         buffer[cbRead ]  L0         int location  512          char FileContents[107643]         memcpyFileContents,ampbuffer[location],SizeOfFile  here i have the contents of the image in File contents.I am sure about it its location. For the first call to ReadFromStream function it works fine.               codepre  pBut my situation is that i have to read the image second time also on the same execution of the program. so what happens when the second time i call to ReadFromStream functionwith the same stream value i can see on debugging the stream value is same. even then the buffer show the contents which are at location far away from the image stored in it i mean the stream had Image File as the first file but in the second call to ReadFromStream the buffer points to the data of another file but the first file   was actually the image file. So the quetion is how this memory is alloctaed up to this unexpected file p  pWhy the buffer shows the data which is at location very far from the starting index.For the second call to ReadFromStream also it should show image file as the starting file. why it show the file which is far away from the Image file   As I guess some memory is allocated and which must be deleted  but where and how i dont know ..am i right   p  pmay be its because in the second call to ReadFromStream this buffer has already some memory allocated i mean for the second call the buffer points to address which dont start from zero but it should do it as i thinkp

Rather than making lots of them for each sqlldr call it just overwrites codelog0.txtcode every time.  Ive checked, the data files are in the correct location and everything so this may be part of my problem or something completely unrelated.p  pThanks in advancep  h3EDITh3  pIn addition to what ThisSuitIsBlackNot and dms said, I also didnt need to specify the location of perl on this system and doing so was actually messing it up, which is weird because I checked and perl stuff was there.p

Negative 2182 pI have a big class, which is used on the user interface of an application. It serves around 20 modules. For only one Module for the time being I need a different formation of number on a codeLabelcode. The applying of formation is programatically only a line of source code. The separation of the cases can be done either by the use of a codebooleancode flag variable, or by applying codeinheritancecodep  pBy boolean flag variablep  precodeclass MyClass      private boolean isYear     ...      public setValue     ...      ifisYear      doFormat      ...        codepre  pThe variable codeisYearcode is set of course externally, when a module serves for year valus is needed.p  pBy applying inheritance I have to create a new class which derives from codeMyClasscode, i.e. codeMyYearClasscode and merely override the method codesetValuecode. I think in the OOprogramming the second approach is recommended, but I have heard also the opinion that in this case it makes the code complicated, more nebulous, less neat and it seems generally an overkill when only one line of code is to be changed. What approach do you consider recommendable p

Negative 2182 pMy question is about when its OK to merge separate models into one single REST resource and whether this leads to tricky and difficult to work with design, down the line.p  pLets say I have a movie streaming service and users can only watch movie genres they have permissions for. Lets say these are represented with these hypothetical modelsp  ul licodeusers idcodeli licodemoviegenres id, genrenamecodeli licodeuserstogenrespermissions id, genreid, useridcodeli ul  pexposed through REST routes codeuserscode codemoviegenrescode and codeuserstogenrespermissionscodep  pNow, as a user client of this API think a website or a mobile app, in order to find out what genres Im allowed to get hold of, I would fetch the genres permissions and then all the movie genres. Two network calls.p  pHowever, an argument could be made that having to make multiple roundtrips to the API is inefficient, and you additionally have to deal with a bunch of joins on the client. This example is simple enough with its 3 relations, but in the real world you could have much longer chains.p  pThus one could consider collapsing two models into one, and for example return permissions already joined to movie genresp  pcodemoviegenres id, genrename, authorizedforcurrentusercodep  pHowever the question is, this thought process can be taken pretty far. You could save the client a lot of joins and roundtrips by doing all joining on the server. However, at what point do you stop At what point is what you returning no longer a REST resources but a generic blob of data thats been concatenated togetherp  pIs there a rule of thumb for deciding where to draw the linep

Negative 2182 pA typical RSA implementation incorporates a multiprecision integer library. A typical multiprecision integer library uses dynamic allocation to represent large integers as arrays of machine words just the right size.p  pI expect there must be a bound on the mathematical integers one may encounter when using the multiprecision integers only to encrypt or decrypt messages of known length typically, symmetric encryption keys with, say, RSA2048, and that it would be possible to implement the algorithm by allocating space for all necessary intermediate results either statically or on the stack.p  pI found a hrefhttpspolarssl.orgdiscussionsgenericarmcortexm3lm3s6965rsaimplementationthis forum threada suggesting this is possible. It does not indicate maximum integer sizes. Perhaps it is obvious you need 2048 bits for all integers, duh. In any case, I would be more interested in an already existing implementation, if there is one.p  pAs a sidequestion that does not deserve its own entry, do typical implementations of elliptic curve cryptography require dynamic allocationp

But everything I could find so far does nothing more than create a static GUI, waiting for the user to do something, then execute some handlers and wait again.

Negative 2182 pI have created and drawn out a custom UIViewController called AutocompleteVC in my Main storyboard.  AutocompleteVC will be used in several different placesstoryboards and with different dimensions.p  pFor example, in my Transit storyboard, shown below,, there is a custom UIViewController called TransitVC, shown on the left.  In TransitVC, I have a container view with an IBOutlet called autocompleteContainerView.  autocompleteContainerView has a segue called autocompleteEmbedSegue to a generic UIViewController, shown on the right in red.p  pThe goal is to have TransitVC hold AutocompleteVC inside autocompleteContainerView.  But Im having trouble getting this to work. The reason I want to do this inside a container view is so I can use autolayout to set constraints on it.

Negative 2182 pI had Cassandra cluster running across two data centers, for some reason, one data center was taken down for a while, and now Im planning to bring it back. Im thinking about two approaches  One is to start up all Cassandra nodes of this data center and run nodetool repair  on each node one by one. But It looks like repair takes long time. I had an experience to repair 6GB data on a node before, it took me 5 hours on one node 3 nodes cluster. I have much more data on the cluster now, cant image how long it will take.  So Im thinking if I can run rebuild instead of repair. I can delete all old data on this data center and rebuild it as adding a new data center. But not sure if it works and how performance would be. p  pAny idea on it Any suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. p

Negative 2182 pLately Ive been getting more and more interested in Meteor.js. At the moment Im developing a new web project of mine. What I cant get out of my mind is the Autopublish feature of Meteor. At the moment of writing my MongoDB has a total of 32453 records, therefore, as you can probably guess I had to turn off autopublish and subscribepublish manually. p  pIve read a mouthful of guides now and it seems to be a completely common practice to turn off autopublish as soon as your application is created. This makes me question  does the feature have any practical use in a real world scenario I can see it being useful for the shock and awe effect of the examples, but aside from that, it seems more or less pointless. I might be missing something very obvious though.p

Negative 2182 pI am interested in taking an Oracle DB and replicating it into hsqldb  very fast, close to real time. And hopefully, also be aware of what fields were changed. I need this in order to boost queries duration  and saw that HSQLDB in embedded in memory mode is much faster than even cached Oracle. However, since oracle grants me persistency, failover etc. I still want to use it.p  pSo, I thought about a few possible approachesp  ol lipUse trigger on every possible table in my oracle db. The trigger will write the change to an auxiliary table. Very bad performance amp practice, in my opion.pli lipperiodically select each table for all the latest updates select  from T where orarowscn  . latest maximal row scn. This has the disadvantage of not knowing about deletes even though we can figure some other way for deletes. This also has the disadvantage of having to diff the previous record with the new record to understand the change. The table may be of 100 fields and the change on only one.pli lipUse Oracle notifications, available since 1110g  using a simple JDBC link  though this has some limitations, like number of fields you can get that have changed.pli lipUse 2 approach along with quering the sqltext table, in order to see which fields were affected in latest updates, and to diff only those from the last 1 minute. This will actually also help with figuring out deletes.pli lipUse timesten instead of HSQLDB, but that costs money.pli ol  pWhat do you think What is the best wayp  pThank youp

Negative 2182 pIm currently working on a benchmark which is part of my bachelor thesis that compares SQL and NoSQL Databases based on an abstract data model an abstract queries to achieve fair implementation on all systems.p  pIm currently working on the implementation of a query that is specified as follows I have a table in Cassandra that is specified as followsp  precodeCREATE TABLE allocated     partitionkey int,      financialinstitution varchar,      primaryuuid uuid,     reportname varchar,     viewname varchar,     rowname varchar,     colname varchar,     amount float, PRIMARY KEY partitionkey, reportname, primaryuuid codepre  pThis table contains about 100,000,000 records 300GB.p  pWe now need to calculate the sum for the field strongamountstrong for every possible combination of strongreportnamestrong, strongviewnamestrong, strongcolnamestrong and strongrownamestrong.p  pIn SQL this would be quite easy, just select sum amount and group it by the fields you want. However, since Cassandra does not support these operations which is perfectly fine I need to achieve this on another way. p  pCurrently I achieve this by doing a fulltable walk, processing each record and storing the sum in a HashMap in Java for each combination. The prepared statement I use is as followsp  precodeSELECT     partitionkey,     financialinstitution,    reportname,     viewname,     colname,     rowname,     amount  FROM allocated  codepre  pThat works partially on machines with lots on RAM for both, cassandra and the Java app, but crashes on smaller machines.p  pNow Im wondering whether its possible to achieve this on a faster way I could imagine using the partitionkey, which serves also as the cassandra partition key and do this for every partition I have 5 of them.p  pAlso I though of doing this multithreaded by assigning every partition and report to a seperate thread and running it parallel. But I guess this would cause a lot of overhead on the application side.p  pNow to the actual question Would you recommend another execution strategy to achieve this Maybe I still think too much in a SQLlike way.p  pThank you for you support.p

Customer Jess click on redeem button at code20131111 092227.497code.p  pThe different time they click on redeem button is only 0.0283 seconds.p  pThus, maybe the different time is too short, both of them was successful redeem the gift because, before the system first customer update the giftinventory table, the system second customer already get the data from inventory Gift A, thus, system still let second customer to proceed because the inventory is still equal to 1.p  pI have think out of a way to solve this problem, which is describe as follow  Create a new column for the giftinventory table, name codelockcode, with data type codeBooleancode . When customer clicked on the redeem button, and before the system check the gift inventory, set the Boolean to codetruecode. Thus, if the second customer, try to access to the gift inventory, and found that the codelockcode  codetruecode, then system will wait for 1 seconds and then try to access again, until the codelockcode  codefalsecode, then only access and get the inventory data. p  pHowever, I dun think this is a good solution.

Negative 2182 pI wrote a large Function Library in QTP now UFT to test a web site. The various functions are called by an Action script driven by an .xls file. Test data is also included in the .xls file.p  pI can currently turn on and off functions by editing the .xls file. This works fine for me but I would like to turn it over for testers to run from QC and have it be mostly hands off. What would be the best way to accomplish this I could create many versions of the action script and keep the monolithic qfl, but that could be a maintenance issue. p  pIs there a way to configure QC to call the various portions of the test via the lab Any other options for setting this upp  pThanksp

Negative 2182 pI have an HTTP API using Flask and in one particular operation clients use it to retrieve information obtained from a 3rd party API. The retrieval is done with a celery task. Usually, my approach would be to accept the client request for that information and return a code303 See Othercode response with an URI that can be polled for the response as the background job is finished.p  pHowever, some clients require the operation to be done in a single request. They dont want to poll or follow redirects, which means I have to run the background job synchronously, hold on to the connection until its finished, and return the result in the same response. Im aware of Flask streaming, but how to do such longpooling with Flaskp

Negative 2182 pIm trying to transfer a file onto a remote computer with a batch file. I dont have permissions to use xcopy or copy. I cant use something like psexec for security reasons. Just echoing with servernamefilelocation wont work either due to permissions. The only way so far I have found is to do a for loop over the file and use a wmic call to echo each line out on the remote computer, but for some reason this isnt working. I get duplicate lines and others dont show up at all I think this is due to special characters. I thought it might have due to timing so I added a one second wait after each wmic call. It was a slight improvement but still doesnt work.

The questions can be disregarded here. One button is codeisCorrectcode and the other three are codeisNotCorrectcode  these are randomized by a separate algorithm. codeN1, D1code and so on are numerators and denominators of the wrong answers, while the names of variables codecorrectN, correctDcode speak for themselves. The values of these variables are all assigned in the loop.  p  pEach button is assigned an codeidcode for each cycle of the loop. If the answer is on button A, codegAnsAcode, which is a variable in place of the button codeidcode, is assigned a value of codeisCorrectcode. The other buttons are then assigned codeidcodes accordingly. I use the arrays codegStoredYourNum, gStoredYourDenomcode to store a users answers. Once all 10 questions are answered, a results table is displayed, which is supposed to show a bunch of information, along with strongthe answer they chosestrong.  p  pAccording to the code block I have above, for every question, a user should have their answers stored into the arrays codegStoredYourNum, gStoredYourDenomcode, yes  p  pstrongHere is the problemstrongbr When I access the arrays codegStoredYourNum, gStoredYourDenomcode using, say codegStoredYourNum[0]code, it is supposed to return the numerator of the option that I chose for question 1. However, I am getting very arbitrary numbers  numbers that arent correct answers to question 1, wrong answers to question 1, correct answers to any other question, or numbers of any of the questions.  p  pHere are some theories Ive come up with as to why this is happening. I am unable to get my head around this problem, though  p  ol lipThe placement of my function. This function is inside the loop that only stronggeneratesstrong the questions and strongstores them in separate arraysstrong. The questions are output by accessing the arrays. However, I am unable to move this fraction out of the loop to where the rest of my jQuery functions are because then codecorrectN, correctD, N1, D1code and so on are not within the scope. If this is the problem, shouldnt I be receiving codeundefinedcode as the values when I access the codegStoredYourNumcode array  pli lipThe code of my function. I have been staring at it for a very long time but I am still unable to see an issue.  pli lipI have multiple instances of the same click handler.

But what about future compatibility What happens if a new Web API or a new Ecmascript version introduces a codefoocode function or a codeFoocode object When a third script is on the page that needs the new standard codeFoocode object, it will crash because my scripts have overwritten it with something completely different.p  pBut even if no thirdparty scripts are on the page, my scripts might run into trouble. Say I have named a global variable codeonfoocode and later browser environments introduce a new event codefoocode on the global window object. Whenever that new event is fired, my global object codeonfoocode will be called...p  pThus my question is whether there is any notion of reserved global identifiers in browser environment or whether some names are considered safe. So how should I name my global module The same goes with other namespaces like custom event names. p

Negative 2182 pI recently read a hrefhttpblog.auth0.com20140107angularjsauthenticationwithcookiesvstoken relnofollowCookies vs Tokensa for Angularjs and implemented the sign in and authentication piece to allow users to sign in from a sign in page. The app is setup to have the account module responsible for sign ins, account registration, profile, etc as a separate page which will redirect to the SPA for the main application.p  pAfter successful sign on the token is sent back to the sign in page client as a JWT and the sessionStorage  localStorage values are set via js. Finally the user is redirected also via js to the main application. The issue is since I am redirecting via js the header can not be set, which obviously fails the auth in the main app when loading the page Since my auth middleware is higher than both static and auth api requests. If I attempt to redirect from the server after a form post rather than returning the token via JSON on success, the sessionStorage will not be set via js as described in the blog post.p  pIve come to a couple of ideas and wanted to get input on which if either is good for best practice.p  ol lipFrom the server set a response authenication cookie http only all our browser requirements allow this cookie which is read on the next request to the main application. The cookie would then be read by the server and allow the secured static assets to be served. My initial thought was setting a cookie defeats the purpose of using a Authorization header on every request since there is a time the cookie could then be read even if its removed on the first api request.pli lipAllow the previously mentioned static assets to load without authentication html, css, application js and on the first internal API request which in the application is required almost immediately on load which will then have access through Angulars http interceptors to set the request Authorization header. The same interceptor can then redirect to the sign in page if a 401 is sent back.pli ol  pI thought the second would be a simpler approach due to only needing to move the auth middleware under the static file middleware and then updating the http interceptor in Angular, but thought it might be bad practice to have static files be able to load and then redirect after the fact. Any input is appreciated.p

Every tutorial Ive read shows someone using chromium in kiosk mode, and while thats fine and works well for some uses, it doesnt work for what I need. I have successfully completed a chromium kiosk, and it was cool. But the signage that I need to create now, has to work without internet. Ive thought about installing LAMP locally on the PI, and still using chromium. I still may have to if this idea doesnt pan out. All I need from the signage is a Title Message in the top center, and a message body underneath it, with roughly 300400 character limit. My idea is to write a screensaver module, in C, that will work with a screensaver such as xscreensaver. The module would need to be able to load messages from a directory on the pi. Then for my clients to update their signage text, I would write a simple client that sent commands as well as the text via SSH to the pi. I want to know what other people think about this. Is it a good idea Bad idea Should I waste my time doing something like thisp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 2182 pWe have a DLL that provides an API for a USB device we make that can appear as a USB CDC com port. We actually use a custom driver on windows for best performance along with async io, but we have also used serial port async file io in the past with reasonable success as well.p  pLatency is very important in this API when it is communicating with our device, so we have structured our library so that when applications make API calls to execute commands on the device, those commands turn directly into writes on the API callers thread so that there is no waiting for a context switch. The library also maintains a listening thread which is always waiting using wait objects on an async read for new responses. These responses get parsed and inserted into threadsafe queues for the API user to read at their convenience.p  pSo basically, we do most of our writing in the API callers thread, and all of our reading in a listening thread. I have tried porting a version of our code over to using QSerialPort instead of native serial file io for Windows and OSX, but I am running into an error whenever I try to write from the callers thread the QSerialPort is created in the listening threadp  precodeQObject Cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread. codepre  pwhich seems to be due to the creation of another QObjectbased WriteOverlappedCompletionNotifier for the notifiers pool used by QSerialPortPrivatestartAsyncWrite.p  pIs the current 5.2 version of QSerialPort limited to only doing reads and writes on the same thread This seems very unfortunate as the underlying operating systems do not have any such thread limitations for serial port file io. As far as I can tell, the issue mainly has to do with the fact that all of QSerialPorts notifier classes are based on QObject.p  pDoes anyone have a good work around to this I might try building my own QSerialPort that uses notifiers not based on QObject to see how far that gets me. The only real advantage QObject seems to be giving here is in the destruction of the notifiers when the port closes.p
Negative 2182 pWhy should I use angular.js or other like js frameworks when I know they are not secured.p  pWhat I mean by security isp  ul liAll the code is written in pure javascript. The javascript can be edited in devtools or firebug. Something like form submission can be easily manipulated. Even if I try to do server side validations for all the http requests, I end up doing double the work.li ul  pHow can I effectively use angularjs keeping above in mindp  pThanks.p

Negative 2182 pI am using Facebook SDK 3.13 for iOS in one of my apps. Everything works like a charm on any simulator. However there is a problem with Facebook Login on device.p  pWhen I click Facebook Login button, a Safari window opens. While it is loading facebook.com, my app running in the background shuts down. During debugging, XCode clarifies this situation with an error tells the application is Terminated due to memory pressure. Therefore session handler never calls any completion method and never fires an exception and no session is opened. So when I close Safari window, my app runs from scratch  does not continue from where was it.p  pHow may I resolve this issuep
Negative 2182 pI am trying to implement a chat application where two usersclients can send and receive messages between each other. I have two classes Server and Client, and can send messages between the clients successfully under certain circumstances. I have two problems with the program right now. p  pThe first problem is that messages are only delivered successfully if the following steps are executed in this exact order p  ol liStart one instance of the Server class, and then two instances of the Client classli liEnter username for one of the clientscalled client1 from here onli liEnter username for the other clientcalled client 2 from here onli liSend a message from the first client who connected to the serverclient1li liSend a message from the second client who connected to the serverclient2li liContinue having conversation until either client sends EndofCommunicationli ol  pIf steps 5 and 6 are switched, so the second client sends a message before the first, the first client never gets that message. All subsequent messages are properly delivered, but I would like this first message to be delivered regardless of which client initiates conversation. p  pThe second issue is with the EndofCommunication string. If either client sends EndofCommunication as a message, the server as well as both clients should display [Username] has disconnected, and both clients should then terminate. The server should continue running, and print the initial Listening for client requests message. p  pRight now, the disconnection message is printed on both clients, but neither of the client programs actually terminate. The server does not print any disconnection message, and does not go to the top of the while loop. I suspect that this is because the client programs do not terminate, so the server blocks, waiting for clientThread[X].join. Code for both the Server and Client class are copypasted below.p  pCode for Server classp  precodeimport java.io.IOException import java.net.DatagramPacket import java.net.DatagramSocket import

Negative 2182 pThis is a problem that I fought with for a bit and couldnt find a good answer out there. I did eventually solve it in R, but thought I would post it anyway in case others need it. If anyone has a more elegant solution, I would love to see it. This is a bit of a brute force effort.p  pI have a series of paired XY Cartesian coordinates. I can easily get the angles between them using a simple atan command. However, I want the angles in compass polar cardinal directions where north0, east90, and so forth. Heres a minimal example to make the data and the Cartesian angles, and Ive posted my brute force conversion to compass angle below. The degree conversion from radians uses deg from the circular package.p  precoderequirecircular test lt data.framexc0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,yc1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1 testangle lt degatantestytestx test codepre  p...producesp  precode   x  y angle 1  0  1    90 2  1  1    45 3  1  0     0 4  1 1   45 5  0 1   90 6 1 1    45 7 1  0     0 8 1  1   45 codepre  pNote that the angles into the lowerleft and upperleft quadrants are the same as that into the lower and upperright quadrants, losing the directionality of the vectors.p

Negative 2182 pSo Ill try and be brief  we have a slider on our website and when we upload the images the text on the slider is difficult to read, so we figured out that if we added a white overlay in photoshop to the picture, the slider looks much better.p  pHowever, this is not a great solution because once the post moves to the general column, we find that the image with the overlay by photoshop is now not as appealing to the eye.p  pThe solution that was asked ,was can we add a semitransparent overlay to the div that holds the slider, so that way any image uploaded will have that semi transparent overlay only in the slider.p  pI did some research on here and other sites working with overlay and css  and have worked it into a set where Im almost there but am missing some fundamental pieces I think.p  pRight now its working on hover only, so I need to figure that out, but if you see the example youll understand p  pIn my utopia  if I click on RUN on jsfiddle, that image should have the overlay on it already, not on hover and I think Im missing where Im supposed to make editsp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9LXcU relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net9LXcUap  precode.box       border1px solid 000     padding5px     height151px     width195px   .overlay        backgroundrgba255, 0, 0, .75     textaligncenter     opacity0         width100height100      webkittransition all 0.3s easeinout     moztransition all 0.3s easeinout     otransition all 0.3s easeinout     mstransition all 0.3s easeinout     transition all 0.3s easeinout  .boxhover      border1px solid 555     borderradius5px  .boxhover .overlay      opacity12  .search      positionrelative     top60px  codepre

Negative 2182 pI am a newbie in C. Im currently doing a task that requires me to read a file, and store each line into a linked list, and then store all linked lists into a linked list.

Negative 2182 pThe PHP documentation contains the reasons why an affectedrows statement might return 0, 1, 1 or even 3 in some scenarios, as does the answer to this particular stack question.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23107189phpmysqlistrangereadingsforaffectedrowsPHP  MySQLI strange readings for affectedrowsap  pBut the wall I hit was that affectedrows was returning NULL. I did not find any stack question which currently answers this issue. So I figured out why it would return NULL. p  pIts because you are making a mistake in your syntax. I tend to associate the usage of affectedrows to the same as numrows. But in fact the usage of both is different and that is why I got the particular NULL value.p  pnumrows usagep  precodequery  handlergtquerysome select query rows  querygtnumrows codepre  pthis would return the proper number of rowsp  paffectedrows usagep  precodequery  handlergtquerysome update insert query rows  querygtaffectedrows codepre  pthis would return null as the codequerycode variable unlike the previous codequerycode would return true or false. Therefore in such a case you would always have to make calls to the codehandlercode database connector object.p  pThis is a problem I dealt with just now and now when I go back and look at the docs page I see that Ive totally missed it. I think many people tend to treat affectedrows the same way as numrows, but thats just me. But I think even though the question is a selfanswering one it deserves a place here, because it took me almost 12 hours before I finally did a vardump and got to the core of the issue. p  pIf someone knows a better answer to this then please improve this answer.p  pThe question lies in why are both numrows and affectedrows treated differently in such a contextp

I read through Apples programming guide that in case of Remote or Local notifications, applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions is called and hold the payload in the launchOptions. From there in case of notifications I can respond to the push. Im testing push on two devices. One that issues the push and the second receives it. I ran the app on both devices and i kept one turned on and the second exited the app to home screen and closed the phone to wait for a notification i didnt close the app on xcode though. I issues a push and i received it on the receiver device, however using NSLog, it seems that applicationdidFinishLaunchWithOptions is not being called when the push is opened and only once at application first start. I didnt provide code because there no much added to test that other than the push which is working fine. What could be wrong is that the right way to respond to notifications opened when the app is in the backgroundp

Negative 2182 pI know you can simulate NFC tags simply by creating an intent and starting and activity with it.

Negative 2182 pI am having a problem where gsutil does not seem to follow the behavior described in the documentation at least in Windows. The documentation statesp  hr  pWhen performing recursive directory copies, object names are constructed that mirror the source directory structure starting at the point of recursive processing. For example, the commandp  precodegsutil cp R dir1dir2 gsmybucket codepre  pwill create objects named like codegsmybucketdir2abccode, assuming codedir1dir2code contains the file codeabccode.p  hr  pHowever, in practice I have found that it will create objects namedp  precodegsmybucketdir1dir2abc codepre  pie, it copies the strongentirestrong directory path stated in the codegsutilcode command, rather than starting at the point of recursive processing dir2 as stated in the documentation.p  pAm I missingmisunderstanding something herep
Negative 2182 pI have a ListFragment that contains a TextView and two Buttons in every item. Clicking on one Button changes the background color of the list item and clicking on the other deletes the item from the list. Now, the background state of an item will be maintained as long as no scrolling occurs. Once the list becomes long enough to scroll, the background states  views of various items are recycled causing list items that were not clicked to have their background colors changed. p  pI am able to retain the state of the background by storing list item positions accessible in the getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent method of the ListFragments custom adapter  a SimpleAdapter in my case  in an ArrayList and then checking if the ArrayList contains a selected position just before the inflated view is returned. If the position exists in the ArrayList then the background color of that item is set to green, else it is set to transparent. Here is my codep  precodeOverride public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent      View view  convertView     final int pos  position      view  super.getViewposition,convertView,parent         Button buttonChangeBackground  Button view.findViewByIdR.id.button1     buttonChangeBackground.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              View view View v.getParent             view.setBackgroundColorColor.GREEN               storing list item positions in ArrayList             coloredItems.addpos                     Button buttonDelete  Button view.findViewByIdR.id.button2     buttonDelete.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v               datalist.removepos             notifyDataSetChanged                           Using the stored positions to retain background state.           ifcoloredItems.containspos         view.setBackgroundColorColor.GREEN     else         view.setBackgroundColorColor.TRANSPARENT      return view  codepre  pThis works as long as no item is deleted from the list. I understand that once a list item is deleted all items after and including the deleted item need to have their positions decremented by 1 in the ArrayList so that states are maintained in their modified positions. I have tried many methods however I always throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException.   p  pWhat code should I add to ensure that all list items retain their background state even after a list item is deleted  This appears to be a simple ArrayList manipulation problem but I am unable to arrive at a solution.p

Ive created the UI and converted it from a mainwindow.ui to a mainwindow.py and now Im trying to figure out how to get the text input from the UI text boxes and have the program use it. p  pI cant figure out how to extract the text from the text boxesQlineEdit and store them in variablesstrings that the program can then use.p  pFrom my understanding, I should create a new .py file and import mainwindow as well as PyQT4.QtCore and PyQT4.QtGui. I dont know where to go from here so any insight would be helpful.p  pAlso, how can I have the program print out to the textbrowserp  pMaybe my approach is flawed and I should rebuild my program around the mainwindow.py filep  pI apologize if this is all trivial information but Ive never used PyQT or Qt creator.p  pHere is the code that I got from the the converted .ui to .pyp  precode  coding utf8    Form implementation generated from reading ui file mainwindow.ui   Created Wed Aug 13 152522 2014       by PyQt4 UI code generator 4.11.1   WARNING All changes made in this file will be lost  from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui  try     fromUtf8  QtCore.QString.fromUtf8 except AttributeError         def fromUtf8s         return s  try     encoding  QtGui.QApplication.UnicodeUTF8     def translatecontext, text, disambig         return QtGui.QApplication.translatecontext, text, disambig, encoding except AttributeError     def translatecontext, text, disambig         return QtGui.QApplication.translatecontext, text, disambig  class UiMainWindowobject     def setupUiself, MainWindow         MainWindow.setObjectNamefromUtf8MainWindow         MainWindow.resize480, 385         MainWindow.setWindowOpacity1.0         self.centralWidget  QtGui.QWidgetMainWindow         self.centralWidget.setObjectNamefromUtf8centralWidget         self.textBrowser  QtGui.QTextBrowserself.centralWidget         self.textBrowser.setGeometryQtCore.QRect100, 120, 256, 192         self.textBrowser.setObjectNamefromUtf8textBrowser         self.widget  QtGui.QWidgetself.centralWidget         self.widget.setGeometryQtCore.QRect150, 10, 156, 97         self.widget.setObjectNamefromUtf8widget         self.verticalLayout2  QtGui.QVBoxLayoutself.widget         self.verticalLayout2.setMargin0         self.verticalLayout2.setObjectNamefromUtf8verticalLayout2         self.verticalLayout  QtGui.QVBoxLayout         self.verticalLayout.setObjectNamefromUtf8verticalLayout         self.lineEdit  QtGui.QLineEditself.widget         self.lineEdit.setObjectNamefromUtf8lineEdit         self.verticalLayout.addWidgetself.lineEdit         self.lineEdit2  QtGui.QLineEditself.widget         self.lineEdit2.setObjectNamefromUtf8lineEdit2         self.verticalLayout.addWidgetself.lineEdit2         self.verticalLayout2.addLayoutself.verticalLayout         self.pushButton  QtGui.QPushButtonself.widget         self.pushButton.setObjectNamefromUtf8pushButton         self.verticalLayout2.addWidgetself.pushButton         MainWindow.setCentralWidgetself.centralWidget         self.menuBar  QtGui.QMenuBarMainWindow         self.menuBar.setGeometryQtCore.QRect0, 0, 480, 22         self.menuBar.setObjectNamefromUtf8menuBar         MainWindow.setMenuBarself.menuBar         self.mainToolBar  QtGui.QToolBarMainWindow         self.mainToolBar.setObjectNamefromUtf8mainToolBar         MainWindow.addToolBarQtCore.Qt.TopToolBarArea, self.mainToolBar         self.statusBar  QtGui.QStatusBarMainWindow         self.statusBar.setObjectNamefromUtf8statusBar         MainWindow.setStatusBarself.statusBar          self.retranslateUiMainWindow         QtCore.QObject.connectself.lineEdit, QtCore.SIGNALfromUtf8textEditedQString, self.lineEdit.setText         QtCore.QObject.connectself.lineEdit2, QtCore.SIGNALfromUtf8textEditedQString, self.lineEdit2.setText         QtCore.QMetaObject.connectSlotsByNameMainWindow      def retranslateUiself, MainWindow         MainWindow.setWindowTitletranslateMainWindow, MainWindow, None         self.lineEdit.setPlaceholderTexttranslateMainWindow, Enter Case Number, None         self.lineEdit2.setPlaceholderTexttranslateMainWindow, Number of cases, None         self.pushButton.setTexttranslateMainWindow, Submit, None   if name  main     import sys     app  QtGui.QApplicationsys.argv     MainWindow  QtGui.QMainWindow     ui  UiMainWindow     ui.setupUiMainWindow     MainWindow.show     sys.exitapp.exec codepre  pAny information helps.

Negative 2182 pIm looking for a way to access a newly created local ParseObject which hasnt yet synced to the Parse cloud server.

I would also be happy to hear of any suggestions for solid references on GIS and R.p  pEDIT I ended up using codedatacountriesCoarsecode from the coderworldmapcode package instead of codemapdataworldcode. This had the advantage of already being a codeSpatialPolygonsDataFramecode. codeovercode now appears to be working as desired. I took down the broken link for the data.p

Negative 2182 pCould someone please advise on the best way to setup this situation in my projectp  pWhen my application starts I have a main UITableViewController showing my data Screen Ap  pUsers can then select one of these rows and depending on the situation they might be taken to Data Entry Screen B or Data Display Screen C.p  pOnce inside either of Screen B or Screen C I would like to use the FlipHorizontal transition so they can toggle between. Each of these will have a button back to the tableview Screen A.p  pHope this makes sense.p  pIve tried to set this up in Storyboard but not sure how. Reason being that Screen A can take them to both Screen B or Screen C.p  pDo I need to setup 1 ViewController for both Screen B and Screen C and just animate between UIViews If so, hows the best way to set this up in Storyboard. Seems like it could get messy.p  pThanksp

Negative 2182 pHy, Im trying to do an animation of a circle drawn on canvas. I can do that pretty easily with ObjectAnimator, however Id like to start the animation when the view finishes loading or finishes drawing. If I start the animation in init, the animation property will be ahead of the actual drawing, so I need to start it on a callback when the whole view is properly set up. I could do that onMeasure or onSizeChanged but those two get called too many times and if i have nested layouts it doesnt work properly. If I use startDelay it works but I dont think that is an accurate procedure.p  pHere is a basic custom view class with animation property that changes the radius of a circle.p  precodepublic class CustomView extends View       private static final String TAG  CustomView.class.toString      public CustomViewfinal Context context          supercontext         initcontext           public CustomViewfinal Context context, final AttributeSet attrs          supercontext, attrs         initcontext           public CustomViewfinal Context context, final AttributeSet attrs, final int defStyle          supercontext, attrs, defStyle         initcontext           private void initfinal Context context            OUTER CIRCLE PAINT         mPaint  new Paint          Adds antialiasing to drawed elements         mPaint.setAntiAliastrue         mPaint.setFilterBitmaptrue         mPaint.setStrokeWidth1         mPaint.setStrokeCapPaint.Cap.SQUARE         mPaint.setStylePaint.Style.FILL          final int animationTime  getResources.getIntegerANIMATIONTIMEID         progressAnimator  ObjectAnimator.ofFloatthis, animProgress, 0f, 0f         progressAnimator.setDurationanimationTime          Log.dTAG, Init ended          startAnimationCircle50f           Override     public void onDrawfinal Canvas canvas          super.onDrawcanvas         canvas.drawCirclethis.getWidth2, this.getHeight2, animProgress, mPaint           Override     protected void onSizeChanged int w, int h, int oldw, int oldh          startAnimationCircle50f                  onMeasure is called automatically right after a call to measure           Override     protected void onMeasurefinal int widthMeasureSpec, final int heightMeasureSpec          super.onMeasurewidthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec         startAnimationCircle50f           private Paint mPaint      private static final int ANIMATIONTIMEID  android.R.integer.configmediumAnimTime     private float animProgress     private ObjectAnimator progressAnimator      public float getAnimProgress          return animProgress           public void setAnimProgressfloat animProgress          this.animProgress  animProgress         this.invalidate           public void startAnimationCirclefloat size          progressAnimator.setFloatValuesanimProgress, size         progressAnimator.setStartDelay2000         progressAnimator.start       codepre  pAnd the XML also.p  precodeltcom.yourpackage.CustomView         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt codepre

Negative 2182 pIm trying to create a SQL query that uses one table to count the number of blade servers our company has in each chassis and groups those, while joining it with chassis information from another table.p  pHowever, one of the chassis has no blades in it, so the name does not appear in the blade inventory table. Using an INNER JOIN creates a table that doesnt contain that blade in any capacity. A LEFT JOIN achieves the same effect, but a RIGHT JOIN gives me an extra row with a null value for the chassis name.p  pIm guessing this is because the nonexistence of that blade name in the first table is being given precedence over the second, but not sure how to correct that. My query, as of now, looks like thisp  precodeSELECT e.EnclosureName, e.PDUName, q.Blades, r.Serial   FROM bladeinventory.table e JOIN      SELECT EnclosureName,COUNT Blades        FROM bladeinventory.table       GROUP BY EnclosureName  q ON e.EnclosureName  q.EnclosureName LEFT JOIN chassisinventory.table r ON e.EnclosureName  r.EnclosureName GROUP BY e.EnclosureName, e.PDUName, q.Blades, r.Serial codepre  pIs it possible to edit this in such a way that the name of the chassis with 0 blades is actually generated by the queryp

Negative 2182 pIm trying to migrate a 30GB database from one server to another.p  pThe short story is that at a certain point through the process, the amount of time it takes to import records severely increases as a spike. The following is from using the SOURCE command to import a chunk of 500k records out of about 2530 million throughout the database that was exported as an sql file that was ssh tunnelled over to the new serverp  precode...  Query OK, 2871 rows affected 0.73 sec Records 2871  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2870 rows affected 0.98 sec Records 2870  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2865 rows affected 0.80 sec Records 2865  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2871 rows affected 0.87 sec Records 2871  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2864 rows affected 2.60 sec Records 2864  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2866 rows affected 7.53 sec Records 2866  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2879 rows affected 8.70 sec Records 2879  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2864 rows affected 7.53 sec Records 2864  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  Query OK, 2873 rows affected 10.06 sec Records 2873  Duplicates 0  Warnings 0  ... codepre  pThe spikes eventually average to 1618 seconds per 2800 rows affected. Granted I dont usually use Source for a large import, but for the sakes of showing legitimate output, I used it to understand when the spikes happen. Using mysql command or mysqlimport yields the same results. Even piping the results directly into the new database instead of through an sql file has these spikes.p  pAs far as I can tell, this happens after a certain amount of records are inserted into a table. The first time I boot up a server and import a chunk that size, it goes through just fine. Give or take the estimated amount it handles until these spikes occur. I cant correlate that because I havent consistently replicated the issue to evidently conclude that. There are 20 tables that have sub 500,000 records that all imported just fine when those 20 tables were imported through a single command. This seems to only happen to tables that have an excessive amount of data. Granted, the solutions Ive come cross so far seem to only address the natural DR that occurs when you import over time The expected output in my case was that eventually at the end of importing 500k records, it would take 23 seconds per 2800, whereas it seems the questions were addressing that at the end it shouldnt take that long. This comes from a single sugarCRM table called campaignlog, which has 9 million records. I was able to import in chunks of 500k back onto the old server im migrating off of without these spikes occuring, so I assume this has to do with my new server configuration. Another thing is that whenever these spikes occur, the table that it is being imported into seems to have an awkward way of displaying the  of records via count. I know InnoDB gives count estimates, but the number doesnt succeed the , indicating the estimate. It usually is accurate and that each time you refresh the table, it doesnt change the amount it displays This is based on what it reports through PHPMyAdminp  pHeres the following commandsInnoDB system variables I have on the new serverp  pINNODB System Varsp  precode  Variablename                    Value                     haveinnodb                      YES                      ignorebuiltininnodb            OFF                      innodbadaptiveflushing         ON                       innodbadaptivehashindex       ON                       innodbadditionalmempoolsize  8388608                  innodbautoextendincrement      8                        innodbautoinclockmode         1                        innodbbufferpoolinstances     1                        innodbbufferpoolsize          8589934592               innodbchangebuffering          all                      innodbchecksums                 ON                       innodbcommitconcurrency        0                        innodbconcurrencytickets       500                      innodbdatafilepath            ibdata110Mautoextend   innodbdatahomedir                                      innodbdoublewrite               ON                       innodbfastshutdown             1                        innodbfileformat               Antelope                 innodbfileformatcheck         ON                       innodbfileformatmax           Antelope                 innodbfilepertable            OFF                      innodbflushlogattrxcommit   1                        innodbflushmethod              fsync                    innodbforceloadcorrupted      OFF                      innodbforcerecovery            0                        innodbiocapacity               200                      innodblargeprefix              OFF                      innodblockwaittimeout         50                       innodblocksunsafeforbinlog   OFF                      innodblogbuffersize           8388608                  innodblogfilesize             5242880                  innodblogfilesingroup        2                        innodbloggrouphomedir        .                       innodbmaxdirtypagespct       75                       innodbmaxpurgelag             0                        innodbmirroredloggroups       1                        innodboldblockspct            37                       innodboldblockstime           0                        innodbopenfiles                300                      innodbprintalldeadlocks       OFF                      innodbpurgebatchsize          20                       innodbpurgethreads             1                        innodbrandomreadahead         OFF                      innodbreadaheadthreshold      56                       innodbreadiothreads           8                        innodbreplicationdelay         0                        innodbrollbackontimeout       OFF                      innodbrollbacksegments         128                      innodbspinwaitdelay           6                        innodbstatsmethod              nullsequal              innodbstatsonmetadata         ON                       innodbstatssamplepages        8                        innodbstrictmode               OFF                      innodbsupportxa                ON                       innodbsyncspinloops           30                       innodbtablelocks               ON                       innodbthreadconcurrency        0                        innodbthreadsleepdelay        10000                    innodbusenativeaio            ON                       innodbusesysmalloc            ON                       innodbversion                   5.5.39                   innodbwriteiothreads          8                        codepre  pSystem Specsp  precodeIntel Xeon E52680 v2 Ivy Bridge 8 Processors 15GB Ram 2x80 SSDs codepre  pCMD to Exportp  precodemysqldump u ltoldusergt ltoldpwgt, ltolddbgt lttablegt verbose disablekeys opt  ssh i ltprivatekeygt ltnewservergt cat gt ltnameoffilegt codepre  pThank you for any assistance.

Negative 2182 pI am trying to integrate ZMQ into an existing windows application that relies heavily on MFC sockets CASyncSocket.  p  pIve got a CWinThread derived UI thread without a GUI that communicates with a server asynchronously using CAsyncSocket.  I would like to add a ZMQ inproc communication line to handle communicating the data received from the server on a REQREP basis to other threads within the application.p  pUsing CAsyncSocket, the OnReceive method is called by the MFC framework whenever new data is available on the socket to be received that might be an oversimplification to the hardcore MFC gurus out there.p  pIs there any such mechanism in ZMQ  Or do I have to add an additional dedicated WorkerThread that the UI thread launches to handle my ZMQ communications to the rest of the app  The traffic on both pipelines is minimal so I really dont want to have to create 2 separate threads if I can get by with 1.p  pNote, Ive got the basics working, Im just having problems with synchronization.  If I use blocking recvsend with ZMQ, it starves out my CAsycSocket because the windows messages never get processed by the thread resulting in sometimes never getting the data from the server that the ZMQ is supposed to be delivering.  But if I use nonblocking ZMQ calls, then the thread frequently ends up sitting idle because it doesnt know to read off the ZMQ socket.  p

I am hoping the final application will sell for 1030, so we are not talking Autocad or Maya prices, but just how worried should I be that someone could easily create a virtual copy  I mean 10 is not a fortune, but it is the difference between my being able to carry on developing the application and begging on the streets.p  pI am wondering if I should use some kind of obfuscation.  Do these really achieve anything  Do they simply make it harder to get good debug messages out  Does anyone have any experience of these, and if so can anyone recommend onep  pAny advice would be very much appreciated.p  pKind wishes  Patrickp

Negative 2182 pIn my application Ive got the following situationp  pIve got a Windows Form with a Tab Control with several tabs. Each tab contains arbitrary content which is added by other classes upon startup or during runtime.p  pI want to set up the tabs in a way that scrollbars appear automatically as soon as the Form is too small for the tabs panel to display everything.p  pWhat Ive tried so far is setting the tab pages codeAutoScroll  truecode and setting the  codeAutoScrollMinSizecode property to the size of the panel.p  pThis did not work as expected as the panels codeSizecode always seems to be 200, 100 independent of its contents.p  pIve created a small example application code below which demonstrates the issue. If you resize the form, youll see that scroll bars only appear if the Form gets smaller than the panel default size of 200, 100 rather than the text box in the panel size of 300, 150. If you set codeAutoScrollMinSizecode manually uncomment line 34, it behaves as expected.p  pThe question is How can the tab page retrieve the actual size of what is displayed in itp  pI could probably recurse through all controls and try calculating the size myself  but this feels really bad.p  pPS Please do not suggest setting the size of the panel to the size of the label, as the actual panels are much more complex than that. p  hr  pCodep  pSimply create an Application in Visual Studio and override Program.cs with the following codep  precodeusing System using System.Windows.Forms  namespace ScrollbarTest      static class Program              [STAThread]         static void Main                      Application.EnableVisualStyles             Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefaultfalse              var sampleForm  CreateSampleForm              Application.RunsampleForm                   private static Form CreateSampleForm                      var sampleForm  new Form               var tabControl  new TabControl  Dock  DockStyle.Fill              var tabPage  new TabPageTest  AutoScroll  true              sampleForm.Controls.AddtabControl             tabControl.TabPages.AddtabPage              var samplePanel  CreateSamplePanel             tabPage.Controls.AddsamplePanel               this does not provide the right size             tabPage.AutoScrollMinSize  samplePanel.Size               uncomment this to make it work             tabPage.AutoScrollMinSize  new System.Drawing.Size300, 150              return sampleForm                   private static Control CreateSamplePanel                       As an example, create a panel with a text box with a fixed size.             var samplePanel  new Panel  Dock  DockStyle.Fill              var sampleSize  new System.Drawing.Size300, 150             var textBox  new TextBox                                Dock  DockStyle.Fill,                 MinimumSize  sampleSize,                 MaximumSize  sampleSize,                 Size  sampleSize                          samplePanel.Controls.AddtextBox              return samplePanel                codepre

Is the following code that retrieves an integer value from some queue implementation correct And the answer is like this p  blockquote   pAlthough the code above uses the queue as object monitor, it does not behave correctly in a multithreaded environment. The reason for this is that it has two separate synchronized blocks. When two threads are woken up in line 6 by another thread that calls notifyAll, both threads enter one after the other the second synchronized block.

This project demonstrates how to migrate a Windows desktop app to Native  Client, running first as a Win32 application define STEP1, then as a PPAPI  plugin define STEP2 through STEP6, and finally as a Native Client module.   Start with STEP1 defined and the defines for STEP2 through STEP6 commented  out.  For each step in the process, uncomment the next     define, leaving the  previous ones on.  Ready, set, port    SELECT THE WIN32 PLATFORM AND RUN WITH     define STEP1 ONLY       define STEP1  Launches the original Windows desktop application, Hello World, which runs  as WinMain.  STEP1 encloses Windowsspecific functions that are used with  the WIN32 and PPAPI platforms.  These will be removed when the full PPAPI  port is finished STEP6    SELECT THE PPAPI PLATFORM   define STEP2  What Changed The platform launches Chrome, which will then load a Native  Client Module. STEP2 encloses the Native Client module APIs needed to link  any app to the browser. The module does nothing except report  startingending the function InstanceDidCreate. The Windows app does not  run because it is not being called.  define STEP3  What changed Replace WinMain with WndProc, and call it from  InstanceDidCreate, launching hellonacl in its own window.  Since WndProc spins in its message loop, the call to InstanceDidCreate  never returns.  Close the hellonacl window and the module initialization will finish.  define STEP4  What changed In WndProc replace the message loop with a callback function.  Now the app window and the Native Client module are running concurrently.  define STEP5  What changed InstanceDidCreate calls InitInstanceInBrowserWindow rather  than InitInstanceInPCWindow.  The InitInstanceInBrowserWindow uses postMessage to place text now Hello,  Native Client in the web page instead of opening and writing to a window.  define STEP6  What changed All the Windows code is defd out, to prove we are  PPAPIcompliant.  The functional code that is running is the same as STEP5.    SELECT THE NACL64 PLATFORM AND RUN    What changed The code is the same as STEP6, but you are using the SDK  toolchain to compile it into a nexe.  The module is now running as a real  Native Client executable in a NaCl sandbox, with naclgdb attached.    RUN YOUR MODULE IN THE WILD   You can run your nexe outside of Visual Studio, directly from Chrome by  following these steps   Build STEP6 and verify the file    ltproject directorygtNaCl64newlibDebughellonacl64.nexe exists   Copy the folder ltproject directorygt into your NaCl SDKs example    directory.

Negative 2182 pIm realizing I dont understand the rationale for why Rails controller tests  specs are structured the way they are.p  pWhen writing controller tests, were encouraged to more or less treat the controller as a unit and write unit tests accordingly, caring only about the controllers inputs and outputs. For example, we set up a certain state of the database and perhaps stub some Devise methods to simulate a user being logged in, and when we call codepost createcode or whatever, we append a hash of params sent to that controller action.p  pThen, for the output, we look at the resulting state of the database, we check the response HTTP code and redirect etc., and any assigned variables that will be passed on to the template rendering process.p  pThe controller is just a Ruby class whose public methods are called to execute various RESTful actions. So in controller specs we dont load URLs like codekittensnewcode instead we call the controller action directly, like codeget newcode. Routes arent supposed to be relevant theyre just another part of the system that decides which controller action to call for a given request.p  pSo why do we have to specify the HTTP method like codegetcode, codepostcode, codeputcode, codedeletecode when calling the controller action Isnt this an external detail, part of how routing worksp  pOut of curiosity, I took one of my controller specs and switched all these methods around, ending up with things like codedelete showcode and codeget createcode. strongNothing broke.strong So Im thoroughly confused why do we distinguish between these methods if theyre not relevant detail to the code that were testing in controller specsp

Negative 2182 pI have read that JavaScript is a singlethreaded programming language. If I understand correctly, what that essentially means is that I cant spawn threads to create multithreaded applications. I am more of a technical writer than a programmer, so thats as far as my capacity to explain this concept allows me.p  pHowever, whether that is the Web or Node running on a server, it is very possible to do asynchronous operations, like listening to a button touch events or reading a file without affecting the UI flow and responsiveness of your application. I have also heard to my despair the term of nonblocking in the context of Node JS, which seems to imply that there are multiple threads in execution preventing the system from blocking. Clearly I am misunderstanding something.p  pTo the question, how is it that JavaScript being a singlethreaded programming language is able to do asynchronous operations Arent those multithreadedp  pI am looking forward to your eyeopener answers. p

I have scoured textbooks and the internet, but there is very little clear to me discussion as to how deal with both simple effects and interactions simultaneously. Are the only options to a include all six contrasts and penalize accordingly or b leave out the simple effects and only present the interactions with lower penalty.p  pThe planned status of my comparisons is a little complex. I expected in advance that condB lt condA lt condC, but I did not know what to expect with the interactions. Im really not sure how to penalize my design accordingly. p  pThanks.p
Negative 2182 pI have a bunch of mobile apps that send data to a mysql server. Each app has its own table and it can easily reach 100,000 records in just a few weeks. I have around 10 million calls to the database currently per day. The way my system is currently setup is every 5 minutes a cron will run a bunch of queries for each table and cache html into a file. Then when the user calls the leaderboard I run 1 query to fetch their current rank and then I show the cached html as well as their rank I pulled from the query. p  pWhile this works, Im looking to change this for 2 main reasons. I want to server the leaderboards up on the client side instead of on my server. I would like to send json and then parse it on their device. Also I would like to add daily, weekly, monthly and all time leaderboards for each app. Currently the way Im storing the data wont allow for that.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipWhat would be the best way to send the json to the user Would it be wise to cache the json like I do with the html in a file and then have the user call that file The only gripe about this is that I will need to create 4 json files for each app daily, weekly, monthly, alltime.pli lipWhat would the db structure look like for wanting to add daily, weekly, monthly and alltime scores Ive added daily scores to some of my apps but I stopped doing it because it seemed like a terrible way of doing it. I was essentially keeping a large list of all the users and what they started the day with and everytime they updated their score I would then compare it to their stored score and get the difference. That table quickly grew very large for jus the daily, if I had weekly and monthly it would be millions and millions of records easily. pli ol  pMy table structure per app is pretty simple reallyp  precodeCREATE TABLE apptest1    id int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   deviceID varchar50 NOT NULL,   username varchar25 NOT NULL,   score int11 unsigned NOT NULL   PRIMARY KEY id,   UNIQUE KEY deviceID2 deviceID  ENGINEInnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSETlatin1 AUTOINCREMENT1 codepre  pUsually I would just make the changes and tweak them as I see fit, but with so many calls Ive found out quite a few times a simple little change can easily crash the server so now I like to get ideas before I even attempt anything. p

Negative 2182 pIn OO I think it is not uncommon for an object to register itself with another object perhaps a singleton for callbacks.p  pIn C I think it is not uncommon to do this registration in the constructor or super class constructor of the object being registered and to do the deregistration its the destructor.  This gives some assurances for the right timing.p  pI have two questions.  What is the best strategy to achieve this in Java in general, given the lack of a destructor  In android, if the object is just a member of an activity or a fragment, I guess the object should be registered and deregistered from within two of the on... methods in the activity or the fragment.  I think it may be hard to know exactly when the object will be destroyed.  Which 2 on... methods in an activity or in a fragment would be best to use for thisp  pAdditionally, perhaps less common, if the object is referenced from a number of other objects can one decide to deregister on the basis it is going out of scope and how or can one only deregister it based on some other state that just implies you are on balance probably happy to no longer receive call backsp

Negative 2182 pThis appears to be a common problem. Has this really not been solved in 5 years p  pstrongThe problemstrong p  pI have a Spring REST service and an Angular front end client. When a user logs in to the website, Spring sends back a cookie to the browser that has an authentication token.

Negative 2182 pI use C and odeint to solve a set of differential equations. I compile the code in Matlab using mex and g on Mac OS X. For some time everything worked perfectly, but now something curious is happeningp  pI can run the same simulation with the same parameters twice and in one run the results are fine and in the other a whole column or multiple columns of the output is NaN this also influences the other outputs hinting at a problem occurring during the integration process.p  pI tried switching between various solvers. Now I am using rungekuttafehlberg78 with a fixed step size. One possibility for NaN output is that the initial step size of an adaptive solver is too large.p  pWhat can be the cause of this Especially the randomness makes me wonder.p  pEdit I am starting to suspect that the problem has something to do with Matlab. I compiled a version without the Matlab interface with Xcode as a normal executable and so far I didnt have a issue with NaN results. Its hard to tell if the problem is truly resolved and I dont understand why that would resolve it. p

Negative 2182 pSo I am having 2 issues here and maybe this is just a poor execution in general so please point me in the right direction.p  p1. Regardless of how many black boxes there are the last one always works correctly, meaning I click the black box and it opens then a red box appears, I can close the box by clicking the dark area surrounding the red box or the red box itself. The issue comes when I click any boxes before the last box, it opens as expected but when I try to close it by clicking the red box it opens another instance of the dark background, I dont want that to happen.p  p2. So I think the deeper issue is when I click a black box it is adding the class fart to ALL .testthree divs instead of just the one for the area I am clicking AND when I click the red box it is also adding the class open to all of the other test divs.p  pSo my question is, Is there a way to contain the classes that are added ONLY to the initial place that I click What I want to happen isp  pI click workImg, test gets the class of open, and testthree gets the class of fart, ONLY for the workImg that i click on. Then when I click anywhere it all closes nicely. p  pLink to fiddlep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdkarasinskiL6gLLyko relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdkarasinskiL6gLLykoap  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classworkContgt     ltdiv classworkBlockgt         ltdiv classworkImggt             ltdiv classtest onegt                 ltdiv classtestthreegtltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltimg srcassetsimagespiece1.jpg gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classworkNamegtProjectltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classworkBlockgt         ltdiv classworkImggt             ltdiv classtest onegt                 ltdiv classtestthreegtltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltimg srcassetsimagespiece1.jpg gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classworkNamegtProjectltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precode.workImg              background151515             width330px             height201px             displayinlineblock             position relative                  .test              position fixed             top 50             left 50             zindex100             width 0             height 0             webkittransitionduration 300ms             webkittransitionproperty all             webkittransitiontimingfunction easeinout             textalign center             background white             color white             fontfamily sansserif   Just cos                    .test.open              top 0             left 0             width 100             height 100             positionfixed             colorblack             backgroundcolor rgba0, 0, 0, 0.8                  .testthree              width0             height0             backgroundcolor red             marginauto             position fixed             top 50             left 50             transform translate50, 50                  .testthree.fart              width50             height300px                    .testthree.close              displaynone                  .workName              textaligncenter             margintop17px          codepre  pJQuery  Javascriptp  precodedocument.readyfunction     .workImg.clickfunction            this.find.test.toggleClassopen          if this.find.test.hasClassone              if.testthree.hasClassfart                  .testthree.removeClassfart                          else                  setTimeoutfunction                      .testthree .addClass fart                  , 500                                      codepre

Negative 2182 pIve just joined StackOverflow and im struggling with a programming requirement with a iPhone app Im developing in swift. I have a tableview list of different calculators and i would like to segue to another codeUITableViewcode when a item is clicked to then do the detailed calculations for that tool. p  pI am likely to have lots of tools in the first table 20 and so i dont want to use storyboard to draw up each new codeUITableViewcode static table with a different segue for each one.p  pI wonder if anyone can give me some advice on how to programmatically code a presentation of a new codeUITableViewControllercode with static cells when a item is clicked. I dont want to use storyboard so i would need to use code to both manage the presentation as well as the generation of the next codeUITableViewControllercode with static cells. p  pI have been able to program a static tableview with a custom class programmatically and linked to a storyboard codeUITableViewControllercode item but i want to do all this programmatically and cut out storyboard all together.p  pAny advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2182 pIn .net, there is an uber threadlocalstorage TLS which allows arbitrary TLS data to automagically jump from one thread to another.

Negative 2182 pI am creating a logging service.

Is this possible and can someone illustrate how you might achieve this  ideally Im trying to achieve IE10FFChrome compatibility so Id be interested to know if there are any complications with the solutionp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodecircle      fill 8BC34A     stroke white     strokewidth 2px     filter urlf1     transition 2s ease   circlehover      filter urlf2     transition 2s ease codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltsvg xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg version1.1 width500 height500 viewPort0 0 200 200gt   ltdefsgt     ltfilter idf1 x40 y40 height200 width200gt       ltfeOffset resultoffOut inSourceAlpha dx0 dy0 gt       ltfeGaussianBlur resultblurOut inoffOut stdDeviation10 gt       ltfeBlend inSourceGraphic in2blurOut modenormal gt     ltfiltergt     ltfilter idf2 x40 y40 height200 width200gt       ltfeOffset resultoffOut inSourceAlpha dx0 dy0 gt       ltfeGaussianBlur resultblurOut inoffOut stdDeviation30 gt       ltfeBlend inSourceGraphic in2blurOut modenormal gt     ltfiltergt   ltdefsgt   ltcircle r100 cx150 cy150 gt ltsvggtcodepre div div p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter trying a few things, Ive put some examples together, although none of them quite do what I want. I need to be able to toggle the transitions on a singleseveral element rather than every circle in the SVG, for which I may have several hundred. I also ultimately want to be changing both the size of the circle lifting as per material design and then increasing the side of the shadow underneath.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidetrue div classsnippetcode snippetcurrentlyhidden pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecode  JavaScript Animations   function       var svg  d3.selectsvgjavaScriptAnimation     setIntervalfunction                    Animate         svg.selectAll.circle            .transition            .duration1950            .attrr, 130                  svg.selectAll.jAshadow            .transition            .duration1950            .attrr, 130                   svg.selectAll.jAshadowexpanding            .transition            .duration1950            .attrr, 140                  svg.selectAll.jAshadowlarge            .transition            .duration1950            .attrr, 110                   Reset          svg.selectAll.circle            .transition            .delay1960            .duration1            .attrr, 110                   svg.selectAll.jAshadow            .transition            .delay1960            .duration1            .attrr, 110                   svg.selectAll.jAshadowexpanding            .transition            .delay1960            .duration1            .attrr, 110                  svg.selectAll.jAshadowlarge            .transition            .delay1960            .duration1            .attrr, 80     , 2000 codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodecircle     fill 8BC34A    stroke white    strokewidth 2px   text      fill white     CSS KeyFrames   svgkeyframes   animationfilters 2s infinite   webkitkeyframes filters    0      webkitfilterdropshadow0px 16px 10px 333       100       webkitfilterdropshadow0px 16px 30px 333         CSS KeyFrames using SVG Filters    .kfShadow1      webkitanimationname shadowexpand  Chrome, Safari, Opera      webkitanimationduration 2s  Chrome, Safari, Opera      webkitanimationiterationcount infinite     animationname shadowexpand     animationduration 2s     animationiterationcount infinite   .kfFill1      webkitanimationname circlefill  Chrome, Safari, Opera      webkitanimationduration 2s  Chrome, Safari, Opera      webkitanimationiterationcount infinite     animationname circlefill     animationduration 2s     animationiterationcount infinite   .kfDropShadow1      webkitanimationname dropshadowexpand  Chrome, Safari, Opera      webkitanimationduration 2s  Chrome, Safari, Opera      webkitanimationiterationcount infinite     animationname dropshadowexpand     animationduration 2s     animationiterationcount infinite    Demonstrate that fill works correctly  keyframes circlefill      0  fill FF0000             25  fill BB0033             50  fill 990066              75  fill 4400aa               100  fill 0000ff            Demonstrate that filter doesnt work as hoped  keyframes shadowexpand      0  filter urlf1 webkitfilter urlf1            25  filter urlf2 webkitfilter urlf1            50  filter urlf3 webkitfilter urlf1            75  filter urlf4 webkitfilter urlf1            100  filter urlf5 webkitfilter urlf1          keyframes dropshadowexpand      0  webkitfilterdropshadow0px 16px 10px 333             25  webkitfilterdropshadow0px 16px 15px 333             50  webkitfilterdropshadow0px 16px 20px 333             75  webkitfilterdropshadow0px 16px 25px 333             100  webkitfilterdropshadow0px 16px 30px 333             SVG Filter Animations    .fAshadow    filter urlf1     JavaScript Animations   .jAshadow      filter urlf1     stroke none important   .jAshadowexpanding      filter urlf1     stroke none important     fill CCC important   .jAshadowlarge      filter urlf2      stroke none important     fill CCC important codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpscdnjs.cloudflare.comajaxlibsd33.4.11d3.min.jsgtltscriptgt lth1gtCSS Keyframeslth1gt ltpgtThe downside here is that the animation seems to require attaching to the svg element, which causes all of the circles to animate their drop shadowsltpgt ltsvg idsvgkeyframes width1000 height280gt     ltg transformtranslate120, 140gt         ltcircle r110gt         lttext dx1.5emgtCircle 1lttextgt     ltggt     ltg transformtranslate420, 140gt         ltcircle r110gt         lttext dx1.5emgtCircle 2lttextgt     ltggt ltsvggt   lth1gtCSS Keyframes referencing SVG Filterslth1gt ltpgtUnfortunately it seems that this approach simply doesnt work.

Is there a way around this, or is this just how Laravel S3 access works p

Negative 2182 pI have table with several columns. One of them is in some case extra large for example contains 800 character, and other columns contains about 50100 characters. Column data contains multiple text lines, where each line has linebreak at the end. I suppose it does not fit on single page based on column width. So, when data is displayed, when such large column comes, on column data.first page I got whole column empty, not a single character in that column in displayed, and on second page is only displayed last line of that text. Does anybody know why this happens and how to fix it I cannot change column width because of the other columns. Can I set some option on jasper report to override such behaviourp
Negative 2182 pI am just getting back into web design and a ton has changed.

It is only a problem on SOME browsers, so I think it should be left up to the user, mobile or otherwise.  Click the pin, it is no longer... well... pinned.  That way the aberrant behaviour of certain browsers can be mitigated by the user.p
