Positive 9287 pIm making a crawler that fetches all relative and absolute links.

When I find that page, Ill append and create a new link to crawl i.e. a hrefhttpexample.comexampleexample.php relnofollowhttpexample.comexampleexample.phpa.

Positive 9287 h1Preambleh1  pWhen a webpage is dynamically generated by javascript based on a hashbang codecode url, google has a hard time indexing it, and cannot provide search results or automatically accept it for services like AdSense.p  pOne solution is to introduce the codeescapedfragmentcode GET variable and serve static a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsspecification relnofollowhtml snapshotsa that represent the dynamic content.p  pThis can be done manually by visiting the website in Chrome, copy the DOM from emDeveloper Console  Elementsem, save it to a codehtmlcode file, and serve these html files when the hashbang is requested in the codeescapedfragmentcode.p  h1Problemh1  pThis is doable for the main pages, but trying to manually follow all the links and save the DOM once all the scripts have executed is nearly undoable.p  pFurthermore, this process should be repeated once in a while so the snapshots dont deviate too much from the actual website.p  h1Questionh1  pI am wondering if there is a tool or chrome extension that automates this. Open a link, let the javascript generate the DOM, and save the DOM to a file named after the hashbang.p  pIdeally this would be simple enough to do from the terminal so this can be automated using codeGruntcode on deploy.p

Positive 9287 pI have been given a list of websites that need to be checked for any flash content. This could be flash video, flash ads, sIFR, FLV, FLA. Ive been tasked with identifying whether flash content is being used on each site, and if so where. The list is a mixture of live and local sites.p  pI could do this manually, by going through every page on each site, but Im sure there is a much more effective, timesaving and thorough way of doing this.p  pMy first thought was to use a spider like Screaming Frog SEO spider, although Ive not used it before. It has been mentioned this could flag areas of a site that are using flash by simply entering the site URL and crawling it. However I believe this would only work for sites that are live and not local ones.p  pThe second thought would be to do a find search on terms like .swf and flash in the local code repositories and note any files that refer to those terms. This would work locally but not live.p  pI think the eventual solution may be to use a combination of different techniques to ensure ive identified all the flash content.p  pMy question is how would you guys go about doing this All effective suggestions are welcome.p  pThanksp

I have been dealing with memory issues which is another question I have open on this site, but started to realize that I am not even getting all the info I need.p  pI am using jsoup to parse an html page, its a test page and there is nothing but millions of numbers separated by white space. When I parse it with jsoup, I can get some of the text, but it wont get all of it.p  pFor example, if I have a codeString textcode that contains the html from .parse, it only has half of the numbers in the entire web page. If I go to the web page and grab the last number and call code.containscode on the codetextcode with the html, it will fail. But if I check code.containscode for a number thats half way in the html it passes, what is the meaning of thisp  pEven more weird, is if I parse the html and write it to text file, the text is empty except for the first few words on the page. The test page basically says test page then followed by millions of numbers, and in my text file it only says test page with no numbers, but there are 100 numbers because I can call .contains on the text to check which numbers are there.p  precode    html  Jsoup.connecturl.toString.get.html             Document doc  Jsoup.parsehtml             text  doc.body.text                      PrintWriter out  new PrintWriterfilename2.txt             out.writeJsoup.parsehtml.body.text             out.flush             out.close codepre  plast relevant test code p  pedit Wasted so many hours on this and the answer was as simple as this not able to parse complete html of a url using Jsoup.

Negative 9287 pIm trying to come up with a simple, easy to use design pattern for error handling in a .net wcf service specifically a silverlight enabled wcf service. If an exception gets thrown in the service method the silverlight application will see a CommunicationException stating The remote server returned an error NotFound   and possibly a stack trace depending in your settings, which is entirely not useful because it doesnt tell you the actual error, and usually the real error is not NotFound.p  pReading up on web services and wcf services and exceptions, You need to throw soapwcf standard exceptions such as FaultException or SoapException. So for a wcf service you need to wrap each method in a try catch, catch each exception, wrap it in a FaultException and throw it. At least that is my understanding, correct me if I am wrong.p  pSo Ive created my design patternp  precode[ServiceContractNamespace  httpMyTest] [AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsRequirementsMode  AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed] public class DataAccess       ltsummarygt      Error class, handle converting an exception into a FaultException      ltsummarygt     [DataContractAttribute]     public class Error              private string strMessagem         private string strStackTracem          public ErrorException ex                      this.strMessagem  ex.Message             this.strStackTracem  ex.StackTrace                   [DataMemberAttribute]         public string Message                      get  return this.strMessagem              set  this.strMessagem  value                    [DataMemberAttribute]         public string StackTrace                      get  return this.strStackTracem              set  this.strStackTracem  value                    Convert an exception into a FaultException         public static void ThrowException ex                      if ex is FaultException                              throw ex                          else                              throw new FaultExceptionltErrorgtnew Errorex                                 [OperationContract]     [FaultContracttypeofError]     public void TestException              try                      throw new Exceptiontest                  catch Exception ex                      Error.Throwex                codepre  pSo to make a long story short, Im still not getting the correct error in my silverlight application.

Negative 9287 h1The Scenarioh1  pI am building a custom CMS for a communications application.  The users can upload images to the server and then later reference them in posts they write using markdown.  Images are stored in a database and referenced with a url of the form codeimagesidcode.  A custom image handler retrieves these and sets a far future expires header so they arent fetched over and over again.  Storing the images in the file system is not an option per the customer.p  pPosts are stored in the database as markdown and as html for performance.p  h3Markdownh3  precodeHeader Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet.  [funny cat]images25 codepre  h3HTMLh3  precodelth3gtHeaderlth3gt ltpgt   Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet. ltimg altfunny cat srcimages25 gt ltpgt codepre  h1The Problemh1  pThese images are also editable.  From a caching perspective this presents a problem.  When an image is edited I need to ensure that the browser gets the latest version.  I have come up with the following solutions, all of which I have found to be lacking.p  h1Possible Solutionsh1  h3Version Fieldh3  pStore a version field with the image.  Increment it when the image is edited producing urls of the form codeimagesidversionversioncode.p  pThis is nice if image urls are always generated from the database.  However, I am storing urls in posts as text and would have to preprocess possibly large swaths of text for these requests.  Also, linking an image would be troublesome since a url becomes stale after an image is edited.  This is probably not a good idea.p  h3New Urlh3  pWhen an image is edited, store it as a new entry in the database.p  pThis means no version upkeep, but old links and old posts suffer from the same issues.  Theyre never updated.  The performance would be good, but the problem remains.p  h3304  Not Modifiedh3  pStore a last edited field for each image.  When a conditional request comes in return http status 304  Not Modified, reducing bandwidth usage.p  pThis seems like the best solution Ive got so far.  The image is cached unless edited, but Ive never used this approach before.  If there are 50 images on the page there are still 50 requests to the server.  Bandwidth will be reduced, but the latency remains.  Is this approach worth that costp  h1The Questionh1  pI have very little experience in this area and Im hoping all of you have more.  Are any of the above solutions viable  If so what is your experience with them  If not what is a better approachp

Negative 9287 pI was looking at the online help for the Infragistics control library today and saw some VB code that used the strongWithstrong keyword to set multiple properties on a tab control.

Since Im still relatively new to C, I quickly went to see if it had a similar construct.

Negative 9287 pI have an app written in C that does a lot of string comparrison. The strings are pulled in from a variety of sources including user input and are then compared. However im running into problems when comparing space 32 to nonbreaking space 160. To the user they look the same and so they expect a match. But when the app does the compare, there is no match.p  pWhat is the best way to go about this Am I going to have to go to all parts of the code that do a string compare and manually normalize nonbreaking spaces to spaces Does .NET offer anything to help with that Ive tried all the compare options but non seem to help.p  pIt has been suggested that I normalize the strings upon receipt and then let the string compare method simply compare the normalized strings. Im not sure it would be straightforward to do that because what is a normalized string in the first place. What do I normalize it too Sure, for now I can convert nonbreaking spaces to breaking spaces. But what else can show up Can there potentially be very many of these rules Might they even be conflicting. in one case i want to use a rule and in another i dontp  pThanksp
Negative 9287 pWere working on a Windows App that periodically has to launch operations which may take some time.  Weve gotten into a pattern of having these operations run on a BackgroundWorker, and writing up a quick WinForm for each operation, where you pass in to the form the necessary parameters, the form wires up the BackgroundWorker and makes the function call, and the form displays the output progress bar moves, text fills up with updates, etc.  p  pNow obviously, this form is very cookiecutter.  The only part that really differs between form copies is which method is called on which object.  So what wed love to do is make it generic, whereby we can take the form, pass in an object or null for static calls, a function name, and an array of parameters, and have it just go from there.  Weve been able to do this with Reflection.  The thing we dont like about reflection in this case is the lack of strongtyping things like misspelling the method call are caught at runtime, and not compile time.  Is there anything available now that might make this more elegant and robust  Ive heard of people talking about things like Delegates and Expression Trees  but Im not sure the former applies and still a little in the dark about the latter.p

Negative 9287 pThey seem to be so nasty.p  pI have a gridview, and the query it runs pulls back 10,000 results if no filters are set... and displays 10 of them on the first page.

Negative 9287 pIm using certificates to secure my communications between client and server no code, just endpoint configuration. Certificates are currently stored in ACOS5 smart cards. Everything works very well except that every time when WCF creates a new channel to access the server, the ACOS5 driver asks user to enter User PIN. Unfortunately, it happens quite often.p  pIs there any way to configure driver to cache PIN that user has already entered within current process at least for some time or how can I cache pin and provide it every time programmatically within same sessionp  pI have found some useful in this a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comeleearchive20090911renewingsmartcardcertificatesviatheinternet.aspx relnofollowarticleap  blockquote   pThis is because in previous versions   of Windows each CSP would cache the   PIN you entered, but Windows 7   actually converts the PIN to a secure   token and caches that.  Unfortunately   theres only one global token cache   but the CSPs cant use tokens   generated by others, so first the   smart card CSP prompts you and caches   a token, then SSL prompts you and   caches its own token overwriting the   first one, then the smart card system   prompts you again because its cached   token is gone.p blockquote  pBut I cant use solution that was proposed by author.

Negative 9287 pI created a custom annotation to display my data. The data comes from moving vehicles and Ive got to update their location on the map as well as their title it shows the last update time.p  pMy first approach was to simply remove all annotations and recreate them. However this leads to a lot of horrible flickering the map clears, and then all annotations appear again and the map blocks while it redraws. Less than optimal solution.  p  pIn the OS4 SDK they improved the codeMKMapViewAnnotationcode and I can now set the coordinates they were readonly before. Changing the coordinates moves the view nicely where it should be  without any flickering. That solved one of my issues.p  pIt said in the API documentation that changing the title of the codeMKAnnotationcode will update the codeMKAnnotationViewcode. Indeed thats the case for the codeMKPinViewcode. If I update the codeMKAnnotationcodes coordinates and title, the pin moves and shows the new data.p  pHow can I achieve the same result using my custom codeMKAnnotationViewcode I cant see any way to ask the view to refresh. I tried calling codesetNeedsLayoutcode on the codeMKAnnotationViewcode but that only resulted in the view disappearing.p  pCheers.p

FULL NOTES     You can compile this program by typing   g main.cc o itutil     You can run this program by typing   itutil ltfilenamegt.log lt slabsgt ltzmingt ltzmaxgt     where zmin and zmax represent the zaxis boundaries of the system,   e.g.   itutil myfile.log 140 0.0 80.0       This program only works with NAMD .log file output   The pressure profile MUST be turned on in your .conf file   for the pressure profile info to dump to the .log file.  This   program requires that info.     This program can handle 1,000 slabs, but it has a limit to the   character buffer and thus VERY large slab counts may cause it to fail.     A standard Composite Simpson numerical integration method is used,   which assumes a nonsmooth data set.     The interfacial tension is integrated at each step and then averaged   so pertinent statistics can be gathered.     You can redirect the output to store the interfacial tension   statistics as follows   itutil ltfilenamegt.log lt slabsgt ltzmingt ltzmaxgt gt ltmyfilegt.out       include ltstdio.hgt include

I could then include in the same helper the image for 2011, 2012 and so on.p  pAt the moment the kase show view calls the uploaded thumbnailp  precodelt if kase.avatar.exists then gt             lt imagetag kase.avatar.url gt         lt else gt             ltimg src..imagesdocument.jpg altDocument gt         lt end gt codepre  pWhat I would like to do, is add a helper such asp  precodedef kasethumb k    if k.jobno.todate  Date.today then     ltimg srcimages10.png alt2010 gt   else      ltimg srcimagesnoyearfound.png alt2010 gt   end end codepre  pObviously the above wouldnt work because the standard jobno would be MXXX where  is replaced with the last two digits of the current year.p  pIs is possible to have a helper method that extracts the first two numbers, but ignores the first letterp  pI did think about doing this with the date created, but people may retrospectively add cases to the application.p  pThanks,p  pDannyp

Negative 9287 pHi i do a lot of research on the web but at most cases i dont have the connectivity to the WWW at all of time of my research. So i would like to get started on creating a Website Copier Application... I am aware of HHTrack Website Copier but that program has its limitations for example it cant copy any of the Wikipedia Pages.. probably cause it access the targets servers on a specified port that is permitted to be accessed at a certain degree. But what im looking for is basically not copying the whole site but just pieces of it. The procedure of copying a web page is simple if you doing it manually. 1Goto the URL. 2Click on FileSave Page As. 3make sure you save as complete page. 3 easy steps. How would do this automated i could use a macro but that just making more work than it has to be. triple the effort....p  pI could probably create a plug in for Firefox that you put in a list of URLs that you would like to be save on to your machine. But im not very familiar with the APISDK  I could probably look at the HHTrack Src and kinda savage some parts and put a nice puzzle together. But if i would to do this from scratch what APIs would i need to look at for either in C, C, or Java im not looking for a gui. but just a simple program. so what are you thoughtsp  pif you wondering what im researching. Mathematics, Telecommunications, Programming, Computer Architecture, Magnetism. Books cost money and sometimes give more info than you need and are not as portable as a netbook. JUST because im researching these fields doesnt mean im a know it all..... so much help would be most helpful.p

The important thing is that it packs all these resolved relations as references into the Hero object, so the calls to getWHATEVER hydrate the object with that data, all this so that when each hero is exported to JSON, it has a list of all the skill records for this Hero, rather than just the ids.

The philosophical problem with that approach is replication, in that if I change a relationship in the database, then rerun propelgen THEN I also have to update my hydration functions to mirror that change in structure.  It seems like all the pieces should be there to allow for skipping that last step and remove the replication.p  pFor example, with the small specificcase hydration function above, All Im doing is calling the getWHATEVER helper functions based on the knowledge in my head that heroskill relates to both hero and skill, and when I get a hero I want to check heroskill and get the corresponding skill list.  Propel knows about these relations as well due to the Foreign Keys, and when using joinWith it is even aware of recursion sets recursive object refs to a string value of RECURSION, so the pieces are all in place for Propel to intelligently autohydrate these objects while gracefully resolvingignoring recursion, I just cant find the proper syntax to make that happen.  p  pie get an Object, resolve its FK relations, hydrate all child Objects rows in related tables by FK and exclude recursive Objects.p  pI guess what Im looking for is a way to completely abstract the datastore, take advantage of Propels class generation ability based on database schema.xml definitions and thus not have to custom write a bunch of helper functions that may be subject to change if data structure changes.   Thus allowing me to code in terms of Objects and not Database records, isnt that the whole point of an ORMp  pI hope that clarifies a bit, thanksp

Negative 9287 pIm currently implementing Paypal Express Checkout within a Zend Framework Application, I wrote my own cart model which consist of two simple class Cart amp CartItem, and they are able to se quantity, get total price, etc.p  pIm not much aware on payment system, and I only use Paypal its my first time, but I though since Im not able to control whats happing there at Paypal it is a good idea to lock the Cart at the beginning of the process when redirecting to Paypal to avoid inconsistencies over the current Order processed by paypal and the actual cart on the website. p  pIt can happen for example if the user open a new tab and try to add products while he is a payment process with paypal.p  pIf your cart is locked the use is not able to add or remove anything from its cart until he finished to process the payment thorough paypal or cancel its order.p  pMy question is do you think it is a good approachp  pstrongEditstrong The reason I dont store anything in the database but only the shopping cart in session is all order are stored with Paypal, so I dont want to store it twice, it is a really really simple system.p

Negative 9287 pI am exporting charts from matplotlib and editing them in Illustrator.

Negative 9287 pi am new to hadoop map reduce framework, and I am thinking of using hadoop map reduce to parse my data.

But I am stuck at doing the same with Hadoop map reducep  pFor example I have a file like xa yb zc..... xp yq zs..... x1 z2 .... and so onp  pNow I have to load this file as columns x,y,z in hive table, but I am not able to figure out can I proceed with it. Any guidance with this would be really helpful.p  pAnother problem in doing this is there are some files where the field y is missing. I have to include that condition in the map reduce job. So far, I have tried using  streaming.jar and giving my parser.pl as mapper as input to that jar file. I think that is not the way to do it , but I was just trying if that would work. Also, I thought of using load function of Hive, but the missing column will create problem if I will specify regexserde in hive table.p  pI am lost in this now, if any one could guide me with this I would be thankful p  pRegards, Atulp

Negative 9287 pThis is going to be a nice little brainbender I think. It is a real life problem, and I am stuck trying to figure out how to implement it. I dont expect it to be a problem for years, and at that point it will be one of those nice problems to have. p  pSo, I have documents in my search engine index. The documents can have a number of fields, however, each field size must be limited to only 100kb. p  pI would like to store the IDs, of particular sites which have access to this document.

Negative 9287 pWithout modifying and recompiling the gnu gcc and stdc library builds, I need to be able to reproduce dynamic loading versions of those libraries with a different embedded soname.p  pI thought I would be clever and use the available static versions and repackage them with something like this codeld E shared static lstdc lgcc lgcceh o librepackagedstandard.socodep  plibrepackedstandard.so is created, without warnings or errors, but ldd reports its not a dynamic library and readelf reports only these basic symbolsp  precodeSymbol table .symtab contains 4 entries    Num    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name      0 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND       1 0000000000201000     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT  ABS bssstart      2 0000000000201000     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT  ABS edata      3 0000000000201000     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT  ABS end codepre  pI am unsure why ld isnt bringing in all of the symbols defined statically.  I also dont know if there are any other special parameters I need to give it for this to work. p  pAnother option is if there is a know cross platform way to simply change the soname embedded in the original elf libraries.  Im currently only concerned with elf formatted binaries.  I am not interested in writting my own tool to change the .soname in existing binaries.p  pUPDATE The reason no symbols were getting compiled is because codeldcode handles static binaries differently than .o files.  By default it does not import any symbols from the .a file unless they are required by a another library on the link line.  I fixed that by provided the wholearchive option.p  pHowever that gives me another error, coderelocation RX866432S againstcodeZSt12Sfirstone can not be used when making a shared object recompile with fPICcodeandcode could not read symbols Bad value They are both from libstdc.a in the bitset.o archive.  So I cant just recompile the .as into a dynamic library because the GNU GCC compile, by default, does not compile the object files used for the static libraries with the PIC option.  p  pThat leaves me with finding an elf tool or recompiling GNU GCC with modifications to its build.   p  pAs stated by one of the answers, licensing issues could be a concern with any of these approaches.  My best answer is that we need to change to our requirements and find a different solution that doesnt involve changing or repackaging the GCC standard libraries in any fashion.p

I guess one way to take this is to design a textbased shell command first and build a gui on top of that later if desired.p  pI truly like the idea that small programs can be composed piped together into more complex systems.  I also like the fact that simple, focused designs should theoretically need less maintenance than a monolithic system that binds all its rules together.p  pHow sound would it be to program something in Ruby or Python for example that relegates some of its functionality to shell commands called straight from the code  Taking this a step further, does it make sense to deliberately design a shell command that is intended to be called directly from code compiled or scripted  Obviously, this would only make sense if the shell command had some worthy console use.p  pI cant say from my experience that this is a practice Ive seen much of.  More times than not taskspecific code relies on taskspecific libraries.  Of course, its  possible that, unbeknownst to me, I have made use of libraries which are actually just wrappers around shell commands.  Or rather the shell command is a wrapper around some library.p
Negative 9287 pIve been working with phonegap for the last 3 months, and have used it to port my apps to Android, iPhone and Blackberry 6.0 and they run ok.p  pHowever, with Blackberry v5.0, the onDeviceReady event doesnt fire.  It is like the phonegap library was not loaded. The same app runs perfectly on Blackberry v6, and the problem is present on both the device and the emulator.p  pSearching in other posts and forums, it seems to be caused by some errors in javascript code, that the Blackberry 5.0 browser detects as error, and after this the phonegap library doesnt load.p  pDoes this make sense how can I verify this nothing shows in the consolebr What else might be wrongp

Negative 9287 pI am new to networking and ask a simple question which makes me very confused. I hope people who has a lot of networking knowledge can help.p  pI send messages constantly from process A to process B. If A and B are located at the same machine, the average endtoend delay is 6 ms if A and B are located on two machines in a local network conected by a very simple router, the average endtoend delay is 176 ms. Process A and process B communicate using java nonblocking socket. Each message is 10 KB and message copies of one message are sent to different receivers. p  pAnother test is to vary the  of message copies. In this test, there are three processes A, B, and C in which process A sends to process B and process B sends to process C. If one message copy is sent, End2End delay is 10 ms if two copies of messages are sent consecutively 20 KB, end2end delay is 147 ms if four copies of messages are sent one by one 40 KB, end2end delay is 800 ms. Every 1000 ms, a new message is sent.p  pThere is no delay between message copies. Why the cost increases so fast when  of message copies to be sent increases Is this related to my networking configuration or my coding problemWhat is the cause of this difference p  pPart of the code is at this link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8107828howtoletselectorthatsocketchannelkeychangeinjavanioHow to let selector that socketchannel key change in java nioap  pAt the beginning, I think it is slow becuase the tcp buffer is full and the process has to wait when there is new room to write.

I also need to be able to differentiate sliding and going up the chairlift.p  pI can probably get those values by combining the accelerometer with the gyroscope, but I have no idea how I could offset the accelerometers values with the gyroscopes.p  pIs this possible, and if so, howp

Negative 9287 pI have a very high number of small images 360x192, taken in sequence as screenshots from a DOS 2D computer game. They have decent overlap and id like to stitch them together into one big composite. Due to their very nature each subsequent image will fit pixelperfect over the next or previous one. As such no rotation, stretching or distortion is required OR desired.p  pThere is a lot of software out there to stitch together photo panoramas. But sadly all of them apply some distortion, even when theyre explicitly instructed not to do so.p  pIs there software that will try to do pixelperfect stitchingp
Negative 9287 pIm currently having to interface with a legacy Fortran program by creating an ascii output file that the program needs to read in, perform some calculations, and then I have to parse the binary output. For the most part, I have this working, but Im running into a slight snag. p  pThe problem Im running into is with Fortran descriptors. Is there an easy way I can get a descriptor like E9.3 into a DecimalFormat object in Java p  pThe DecimalFormat I have works only for numbers less than 1. For numbers lt 1 such as 0.123,  they are written out with the sign on the exponential, as 1.230E01. However, for numbers greater than 1 12.345, they are written out as 1.234E01 rather than 1.234E01. From what Im being told, the program is expecting that  sign as part of the exponential. p  pThe DecimalFormat string Im currently using is 0.000E00, and Im currently pulling some string manipulation to insert the  in there after the E but before the digits if necessary.

Negative 9287 pIve just done the following thing with Git but I am not sure if its the right way of doing things. What I have is a file that has some stuff. Then there is a branch that adds extra stuff to this file extends it, its a plugin we sell separately. Lets say branch1 and branch2 have a file with the following contentp  precode branch1  123   branch2  123 qwe  codepre  pThen I did some work on a major feature in branch1 and made a commit to that branch. After that I merged branch1 into branch2 to reapply this new feature to the plugin version of the file as well. Now the files arep  precode branch1  1234   branch2  1234 qwe  codepre  pBut the code doesnt completely work and I now need to switch to branch2 and do some changes to the code that extends the file there change qwe to qwer. However while working I am also finding some mistakes in the base code 1234 and fix them change 1234 to 12345. Now my working directory with the HEAD being in branch2 has the followingp  precode branch2 working directory  12345 qwer  codepre  pNow I need to commit this, the result I am aiming for isp  precode branch1  12345   branch2  12345 qwer  codepre  pI fear that if I just commit this to branch2 and then will separately reapply the 123412345 change to branch1 and commit that too, this will yield the results I am looking for but Git will recognize this as two separate and fully independent commits and when Ill be going through a similar process in future e.g. 12345123456 in branch1 and then branch1branch2 merge, Ill get a conflict in that place. So my solution is to use interactive staging to commit only qweqwer change to branch2. Then stash the remaining changes otherwise it wont allow to switch back to branch1, switch to the other branch, apply stash, commit 123412345 to branch1 and finally merge branch1branch2.p  pThat did the trick however since I am relatively new to Git I am not very sure if I am using things right and in the best possible way. Please let me know if the above makes sense and if it doesnt please tell me a better way of doing that.p

Negative 9287 pHi Im working on a phonegap  jquery mobile  app. It is an audio media.play based app. I have the problem of multiple instances with StatusBarNotification plugin. Ive tried to force with androidlaunchModesingleTop and it seems to work fine, but in some strange cases a new instance of the app opens, and the first one is working on background with the audio running. p  pIt is quite annoying becouse I cant stop the audio until I get back to the first one.

Negative 9287 pbBackgroundbbr I know this question is a little weird, but heres the explanation.p  pI have codeTableAcode in my database. I then have two separate queries that contain joins from 2 other master tablesp  precodeSELECT TableA.

FROM MasterTable2 INNER JOIN TableA ON MasterTable2.ID  TableA.ID WHERE MasterTabe2.Field  some specific value codepre  pI now have values from codeTableAcode in 2 queries, same columns and everything, but this is really like having 2 tables and I cannot figure out how to get one table and one set of columns from all the data.p  pbQuestionbbr So, my question is how can I get the codeTableAcode values from the separate SELECTJOIN queries into one table with one set of columns where I can call codeSELECT DISTINCTcode on that final table.p  pIf this requires more explanation let me know. Hopefully I was able to explain it well enough.p

Negative 9287 pIm getting a string as an output parameter, and need to know what to set for the Size argument in the call to AddOutParameter.p  pI know I could just use some huge number, like int.MaxValue, but want to know best practices.p  pIn SQL Server, the column is actually a uniqueidentifier type.  The TSQL statement being executed inserts a record, and then sets some output variables to the ID and GUID of the newly inserted records.  This is the actual code Im using, but with variable names changed.p  precodedatabase.AddOutParametercmd, someInt, DbType.Int32, 0 database.AddOutParametercmd, someString, DbType.String, 0  database.ExecuteNonQuerycmd  someInt  intdatabase.GetParameterValuecmd, someInt someString  database.GetParameterValuecmd, someString.ToString codepre  pWhen executed, I get the following error...p  pSystem.InvalidOperationException String[2] the Size property has an invalid size of 0.p  pSo its obvious to me that you cant just use a size of 0 with a string output parameter.  You can do that with an Int32 output parameter, but I guess a string needs a valid size.  So what is the best practice for setting the size  Can it just be a huge size without affecting performance at all  Can I just set it to int.MaxValue or something  Is there any constant that can be used here didnt see any String.MaxValue  you can probably tell Im new to C, with a Java background.p  pShould I find out what the max size of a uniqueidentifier column is and set the size to that  What about if Im doing the same thing for a VARCHAR or NVARCHAR columnp  pI wish the framework would just do it for me I dont want to specify a size for every string that I get as output.  Anyone have any suggestions here for best practicep  pIve read the posts below, as well as MSDN documentation, but theres not really a best practices answer to this that Ive found yet.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3108881addoutparameternonmagicnumberwayoffindinglengthofdbtypeint32AddOutParameter  nonmagic number way of finding length of DBType.Int32ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4948051readvarbinarymaxfromsqlservertocsharpRead VARBINARYMAX from SQL Server to Cap

Negative 9287 pIm attempting to justify the post content text on my blog posts. I searched the style.css sheet for the content section to change the paragraph text to alignjustify, However I was unable to find such a section. So I used firebug to inspect the page and found that the text properties were on a separate style sheet text.css. So I opened that style sheet and changed the paragraph text alignment to justify. However, this changed the text on the entire page, including the sidebar text. So I inspected the sidebar with Firebug and found that the side bar text excerpt paragraph class isnt separated as it normally is. The post content text and sidebar excerpt text are all under the same class, so when I change it to justify, it changes them both. Im guessing that I need to create a different class for the sidebar, can someone point me in the right direction Thanksp  precodep  padding 5px 0 margin 0 0 5px textalign left color666 codepre
Negative 9287 pI am using Ruby on Rails 3.2.2 and I would like to know if it is a correct  not dangerous  common approach to pass an codeActiveRecordRelationcode object as a method parameter.p  pAt this time I am planning to use this approach in a scope method of a my model this wayp  precodeclass Article lt ActiveRecordBase   def self.withactiveassociationsassociations, active  nil      associations.class      gt ActiveRecordRelation      case active     when nil       scoped     when active       withidsassociations.pluckassociatedid     when notactive       ...     else       ...     end   end end codepre  pemNote Iem I would like to use this approach for performance reasons since the codeActiveRecordRelationcode is lazy loaded in my case, if the codeactivecode parameter value is not codeactivecode the database is not hit at all.p  pemNote IIem the usage of the codepluckcode method may generate an error if I pass as codeassociationcode parameter value an codeArraycode instead of an codeActiveRecordRelationcode.p
Negative 9287 pI continuously find myself having problems with elements floated right in IE7. p  pI have read many Stack Overflow questions which are similar to this one but there doesnt seem to be any consistently clean CSS answers.p  pWhat I mean by this is is I want to see answers which strongDO NOT change the HTMLstrong. E.gp  ul liPut the floated element firstli liAdd a clear both div after the floated element.li ul  pI understand that sometimes the floated element doesnt account for its parents height and therefore sometimes fails to contain it properly. Occasionally I find myself adding layout to an element with zoom 1 which sometimes fixes it. Other times I find myself messing about in a conditional IE7 stylesheet which isnt the best fix in my opinion.p  pNote What I mean by having layout  a hrefhttpwww.satzansatz.decssdonhavinglayout.html relnofollowhttpwww.satzansatz.decssdonhavinglayout.htmlap  pI have also read other answers to do with using relative and absolute positioning parent div and child div respectively.

Negative 9287 pI have a network file share with a number of shortcuts in it, each of which runs one of several applications which load data into them from that particular file share. The network file share amp applications are located on a system running Server 2003, and all permissions on that file share have been unchanged.  p  pThe applications run fine when executed from a system running Windows XP.  One system was just changed to Windows 7.  In running the applications on Windows 7, the user was then a local administrator on that Windows 7 system.  Initially, they each functioned properly, and I was able to print from one particular application. However, when the user is now no longer a local administrator on that system, the application will not print, saying it requires local admin permissions to do so.  You can get around it by rightclicking and running with elevated permissions on the shortcut  the application will print amp function fine.  p  pHowever, remembering to rightclick amp run with elevated privileges is not easily remembered, especially when youve navigated down several levels in the application only to find youre unable to print from within the application.  p  pThe shortcuts are located either by using UNC names or by mapped drives depending on the user.  In my test, Im using the UNC name  p  precodeservernamedatafoldercontentmyshortcut.lnk codepre  pIf I go to Properties on the shortcut, the Compatibility Mode is greyed out and cannot be changed.  However, if I go to the Troubleshoot Compatibility amp accept the recommended settings  the application executes fine.  However, when it tries to save the changes the Troubleshooter recommends, it says that the application is incompatible.  FWIW, the Fix Application sets CompatMode  WINXPSP2 and UserVerifySolution  VerifyYES.p  pShort ofp  ol liRemembering to run the shortcut with elevated permissions, OR li liMaking the user an admin on the local systemli ol  pis there a way to apply changes in compatibility mode across a number of shortcuts on a network share without making more of a mess, or opening these shortcuts with elevated privileges  p  pThanks,p  pSCp

Negative 9287 pI am running some CPUintensive Clojure code from within Intellij Idea I dont think thats important  it seems to just spawn a process.  According to both htop and top, it is using all 4 cores well, 2  hyperthreading on my laptop.  This is despite me not having any explicit parallelism in the code.p  pA little more detail top shows a single process with 380 CPU use, while htop shows a parent process and then 4 children, each with 14 the time and 100 CPU.p  pIs this normal  Or does it mean I have got something very wrong somewhere  The code involves many lazy sequences, but at its core modifies a mutable data structure a mutable  not a Clojure data structure  hash that accumulates results.  strongI am not using any explicit parallelism.strongp  pA significant amount of time is likely I havent profiled spent in JCAJCE crypto lib  I am using multiple AES ciphers in CTR mode, each as a stream of secure random bytes a hrefhttpsgithub.comandrewcookeparticlblobmastersrcclpartirandom.clj relnofollowcode herea, implemented as lazy seqs.  Perhaps that is parallelizedp  pMore random ideas  Could this be related to IO  Im running on an encrypted SSD and this program is processing data from disk, so does a lot of reading.  But htop shows system time as red, and these are green.p  pSorry for such a vague question.  I can post more info if required.  This is Clojure 1.4 on 64bit Linux JDK 1.7.005.  The code being executed is a hrefhttpsgithub.comandrewcookeparticlblobmastertestclpartipaper.clj relnofollowherea but its pretty messy more apologies and spread across various files most CPU time is spent in codenearestindumpcode in the code there.  Note  please dont waste time trying to run code to reproduce, as it expects a preexisting datadump to be on disk which isnt in git.p  pstrongdebuggerstrong Running in the debugger thanks, AM shows four threads if I understand the debugger correctly, but only one is executing the program. They are labelled finalizer, main the program, reference handler, and signal dispatcher. Finalizer  ref handler are in wait state signal dispatcher has no frames available.  I tentatively think this means the parallelism is at a lower level, perhaps in the crypto implementationp  pstrongAhastrong I think its parallel GC Java now has a concurrent collector.  At the start, CPU use jumps way up when the actual process pauses it prints out a regular tick.  And since its churning through lots of data its generating a lot of shortlived objects confirmed by using XXUseSerialGC which reduces CPU use to 100p

Negative 9287 pI was trying to use the following way to center a codeltdivgtcode in another codeltdivgtcode by using CSS. but it only works in Chrome, but not IE9 and Firefox 13.0.1.

If i remove the code codetop 100pxcode in the above css file, the bottom border of inner div is supposed to exactly cover the outer div bottom border, because inner divs height is 200px, out divs height is 400px, and then set inner div to codemargintop 50code, both divs bottom border should be together. but it is not. p  pI also found out that margintop50 depends on outer divs width. if the width is longer, then codemargintop 50code will make inner div go down further. It is so weird.p  pAnyone knows the reasonsp

Negative 9287 pThe question title basically says it all.  What Id like to do is drag a componentview from one superview to another in XCodes interfacebuilder without having its frameposition be reset.  p  pXCodes default behavior when doing this appears to be to center the view being moved vertically and horizontally in its new superview, while preserving its dimensions.  This is extremely frustrating, as it means that the view needs to be manually repositioned in its new superview.  But I had it positioned correctly before I moved it, so Id like XCode to just remember all attributes of its frame instead of just its widthheight.  Is this possiblep

Negative 9287 pI have been playing with angularjs for couple of days and like it so far. I am trying to build a chrome extension which attaches a small widget below every gmail message when the user is on gmail.com. So far so good.  As part of authentication code, I handle 401 error in this way. Whenever there is a 401 error, I  use  location.path login  to redirect the user to the login screentemplate. This changes browser address bar which seems to be the default behavior. So, if the current address was a hrefhttpsmail.google.commailu0 relnofollowhttpsmail.google.commailu0a, it becomes a hrefhttpsmail.google.commailu0login relnofollowhttpsmail.google.commailu0logina.  But mine is not standalone app, its more like widget that attaches to a div when on gmail.com site. My app should not mess with the browser address bar. I am now starting to think if I can really use angularjs for my app as I am going against the default behavior. Should I use angularjs at allp  pI also posted it here  a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicangularTrT54rIYmg relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicangularTrT54rIYmgap

Negative 9287 pI have searched the web for this issue. And there is a post already with the same title, but not really describing the actual question. So I havent found the right solution.p  pIm developing very large projects. So it is absolutely necessary to split it up into several layers or components or whatever you want to call it.p  pEach layer exposes some functionality. For each layer it is not important how it will be implemented since this changes oftenly on large projects, but what is important, is how we call the functionality and what it returns us  the contractp  pIf we have two layers one concerning the TransactionService and another the BankService, the BankService is a layer higher than the TransactionService and will use the transactionservice. The transactionService will merely do a transactionp  precodeTransactionVO doTransactionclientFromVO, clientToVO codepre  pAnd another layer which does additional stuff.. TransactionVO is not an model class They are valueobjects so the implementation of the service is not exposed to outside the layer. In java we can achieve this byp  precodepublic interface TransactionService     TransactionVO doTransactionclientFromVO, clientToVO  codepre  pThe implementation would be likep  precodepublic class TransactionServiceImpl     public TransactionVO doTransactionclientFromVO, clientToVO         implementation       codepre  pBecause we define our interfaces up front, we have a contract which states how each service will look like without having an actual implementation, the TransactionServiceImpl doesnt need to exist yet. p  pTherefor 2 teams can work simultaneously on each layer and they can mock the implementation. I wonder how to achieve this in Django Creating a REST api for each layer is simpily not done to much overhead, performance issues.. So for those who have experience on very large projects p

Negative 9287 pI am working on a ruby on rails project currently where I scrape and save data everyday from sites who publish valuable data daily but dont store them for long. I am scraping those and saving those to our database to make time series data sets. We have almost strong75 assetsstrong and for each asset, we have strong20 years historical datastrong on an average. There was an error in an algorithm previously and due to that all of our historical data are incorrect now. I found the problem and rewrite the algorithm which is working perfectly right now. I tried to modify the database for previous 1 year historical data for 1 asset and its working perfectly. Now, the fact is, when I update the database locally it takes about 10 minutes for 1 asset with 1 year historical data. If I do the same thing on heroku, it takes about 37 minutes which seems to be very long. As we have 75 assets each with 20 years historical data so I assume, it should take, strong752037  55,550 Minutes  925 Hoursstrong  It does not seem to be feasible to me. Again, the data is very valuable for us so we need to update our database for all historical data that we have. I am using PostgreSQL database locally and on heroku as well. My suspect is, Rails active record is not designed to do this kind of things and its very much expensive too. What should I do in this situation What should be the optimal solution for my problem How can I make this task much more faster serving my purpose completely  Any kind of suggestionidea is well appreciated.p
Negative 9287 pIm making a War Game for iOS using Monotouch and C.  Im running into some problem with the audio sound effects.  p  pstrongHeres what I requirestrong  The ability to play many sound effects simultaneously possibly up to 1020 at once and the ability to adjust volume for example, if the user zooms in on the battlefield the gun shot volume gets louder.  p  pstrongHere are my problemsstrongp  pWith AVAudioPlayer, I can adjust volume but I can only play 1 sound per thread.  So if I want to play multiple sounds I have to have dozens and dozens of threads going just incase they overlap...  This is a war game, picture 20 soldiers on the battlefield.  Each soldier would have a sound thread to play gun fire sounds when they shoot because It is possible that every soldier could just happen to fire at the same exact time.  I dont have a problem with making lots of threads, but my game already has dozens of threads running all the time and adding dozens more could get me into trouble... right  So Id rather not go this road of adding dozens of more threads unless i have too...p  pWith SystemSound, I can play as many sounds as I want in the same thread, but I cant adjust the volume.... So my work around here is, for every sound effect i have  save it like 4 times at 4 different volumes.  That is a big pain... Any way to adjust volume with SystemSoundsp  pBoth of these answer some of my requirements, but neither seems to be a seamless fit.  Should I just go the AVAudioPlayer multithreading nightmare road  Or the SystemSound multifilewithdifferentvolumelevels nightmare road  Or is there a better way to do thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 9287 pI am new to LuceneNet .. I should say very new. I had a few doubts in my mind which i was unable to clear after reading a lot of data regarding it. Well I am in a scenerio where I will be having huge numbers of PDFsDocsExcelsImages and also web pages which will be having related data to it. There are various types of users there in the system, some of them have access to the particular PDFsDocs , some of them dont. I am to use Azure where I wish to deploy my app. So if a user searches something, I want to show him only those results, for which he is authorized to see. is it possible to do it if i use LuceneNet Also I wish to keep a track of Hits to a particular DocumentURL etc. so that it can shown in most searched etc. So is it possible to implement this using LuceneNet   What things do I need to use if I want to index the files and data inside them when it comes to PDFDocDocxXSLXSLXPPTPPTX etc. How should I store the data  indexed data  by LuceneNet  I mean should I store it in BLOB storage Is it advisable I want my application should be scalable. So will the LuceneNet support me in that Can I have multiple instances of its worker role How the reindexing can occur Does reindexing regenerates all indexes if so during reindexing will I be able to search  Sorry for so many questions together, all of them might not in proper sequence too. but I asked as I recollected.p

Negative 9287 pIm using eclipse with windowBuilder plugin. Im facing a serious problem in the swing layout. In netbeans the default layout of swing is free design layout. But in eclipse the default swing layout is flowtype layout. When I add components like jbuttons or jtextfields into the panel and Im not able resize the components in the panel. If I choose coordinate type layout the components stick to correct coordinate and wont adjust its position when we resize the window. In netbeans we enjoys the facilities like Horizontal and vertical resizing gap, while in windowbuilder i could not find them for positioning components in the jpanel. Is there any layout like free design layout in windowbuilder so that I can enjoy the flexibility I get in netbeans GUI designingp

Negative 9287 pI have a problem with a websiteapplication that I am developing. It is actually two problems with a common cause. I am using jQuery, jQueryMobile, and PHP.p  ol lipI have a login system using sessions in PHP and a user types in a Username and Password and then logs in. On the next page, there is a check to make sure they are logged in as an authorized user if they just use the URL, for instance and a Log Out button. If they log out and try to access the page via the URL it denies access, however when the press Log Out it brings them to the login form and if they use the browsers Back button it will bring them back to the logged in page since it is cached.pli lipI have dropdowns with a form submitted onChange and the form will do some stuff in PHP and then link them to another page with a headerlocation sitepage.php. If the user presses the browsers Back button, the page is loaded from the cache and the current dropdown value is set to the one they selected previously. Now, to trigger the onChange event on that same option again they have to change the dropdown to the default select one option and then back to the one they want. pli ol  pBoth of these problems seem to result from caching. If there is an efficient fix for this I would love that but if I need to turn off caching I understand that will effect speed and that is ok for now.

Negative 9287 pIn September 2012, Facebook introduced place topics as described herep  pa hrefhttpstarien.comfacebookpagesplacetopicsonfacebookpages relnofollowhttpstarien.comfacebookpagesplacetopicsonfacebookpagesap  pTopics act as tags or subcategories for pages and places. These differ from the more generic category labels eg. local business by adding a layer of specificity eg. liquor store. Topics are found under the profile image next to a tag icon.p  pIll use this page  place, with the topic liquor store, as an example a hrefhttpwww.facebook.comRoyalLiquor relnofollowhttpwww.facebook.comRoyalLiquorap  pIm looking for a way to pull these topics from Facebook pages. The Graph API for this location gives me a category of Shoppingretail, and a handful of other information, but the topic liquor store is nowhere to be found.p  pClicking on the liquor store topic brings you to what looks like a special topic page. So it looks like liquor store has a topic id of 199833073363963. Interestingly, when attempting to pull data about the topic via the Graph API, you get the errorp  precode   error      message 3 App must be on whitelist,      type OAuthException,      code 3     codepre  pThis error appears even within the context of the Facebook Graph API Explorer app.p  pIs there any way to pull this topic data Or is this simply a new feature for which Facebook has yet to introduce an APIp  pThanks for any help Google doesnt seem to have much information on the topic.p

Negative 9287 pThis is all in the context of JBox2D in Java.  The World class creates Body instances with a function.  Im trying to add a bit more stuff to Body for my application.  Body is represented by ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI in this question.  p  pHere is the generalized question.  I am trying to add a bit more functionality to a premade class by extending the class.  I hope to do something like thisp  precodeclass SomeMore extends ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI     int myExtraInt     A bit more API functions  codepre  pSo that I may do thisp  precodeSomeMore smnew SomeMore sm.someOldAPI sm.butAlsoMyNewAPI codepre  pThe problem is that this ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI is created by another class that I cant modify the World class in the original context, so I am not simply creating them on my own otherwise this would work.  Since I am stuck having to start with a ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI, I have been searching for a way to emconstructem a SubClass from a SuperClass, whereas there are many examples of emcastingem a SuperClass to a Subclass but this is not applicable here.  Here is an example of the function that needs to be completedp  precodepublic SomeMore create...      ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI ccwlaomyWorld.create...     SomeMore sm          return sm  codepre  pstrongAlternative to Wrappingstrong My original solution was to encase the ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI into my own class.  In order to construct my new class, I simply pass the old class into my new constructor and move onp  precodeclass SomeMore     public ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI ccwloa     int myExtraInt     public SomeMoreComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI nccwloa         ccwloanccwloa         myExtraInt0          A bit more API functions  public SomeMore create...      ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI ccwlaomyWorld.create...     SomeMore smnew SomeMoreccwlao     return sm     OR more simply     return new SomeMoremyWorld.create...  codepre  pBut in order to access the old API, I need to do thisp  precodeSomeMore smnew SomeMore sm.ccwloa.someOldAPI sm.butAlsoMyNewAPI codepre  pI could just be a bit unreasonable, but this kind of functionality is tedious and adds just that much more complication to something that doesnt need it.  I mean, if someone wanted to add a tad more functionality, would they wrap my class into yet another class, and have 3 class heirarchies to go through to get old APIs  Also, it would feel just wasteful to wrap every single API in the old class into my new class theres a lot of them.p  precodesm.someOldAPIButWrappedInMyClass not desirable codepre  pI do not have access to the java files of ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI, only the compiled class files.  I can not simply force my modifications into the old class and even if I could, Id prefer not to anyway.  I am relatively new to java, so perhaps this is not the bestproper way to do this, but I havent been able to find an alternative.p

Negative 9287 pIm working on a quite simple LOB application Every Business Object is in a certain state, defined by a state object. Admin users can addremove state objects. Additionally they can define rules depending on the states which properties can be written,.... Everythings fine so far.p  pBut to be really useful, its necessary to define valid transition between states. So I think, I should implement a simple, configurable statemachine. Its not a big deal to define statemachines with onentryonexitactions and transitionconditions for an individual Business Object. But of course there are dependencies between different kind of objects. Have a look at these simple statemachinesp  pimg srchttpi47.tinypic.com285xc2.png altImage linkp  pDescription of both statemachinesbr For Type1 there are just sequential transitions from 1 over 2 to 3.br For Type2 there is a transition from A to B and from B there are two transitions to C and D.p  pOn the transition from 2 to 3 I have the preconditionbr emAll associated Type2 objects should be in state Bem.br When this transition is taken, associated Type2 objects should change to C or D based on a condition.br And on state 3 if have the preconditionbr emAll associated Typ2 objects should be in state C or Dem.p  pNow I wonder how I should implement this interstatemachine communication. I had a look at SCXML and UML statecharts At first glance, events triggered on transitionexecution look like a good idea. But if I understand it right, due to the runstocompletion semantic, onentry actions are performed before the events triggered in an transition are evaluated. So I cannot rely on the effects of an event in onentryvalidation.p  pLooks like I need some kind of synchronous event processing immediately process triggered transitions, but im not sure if this is really a good idea. Will this solution work Are there any problems What do you think about the whole concept Are there more reasonable solutions p  pAny help is highly appreciated.p

Negative 9287 pIm part of a team reviving a dormant open source project. One of the first things I did was fix the software to build with Visual C on Windows. The plan is to distribute the MSVC version in the upcoming release.p  pThe current DLL is built with the codestdcallcode calling convention, for reasons I cant explain. No big deal, except it was also built with MinGW and MinGW and Visual C disagree about what codestdcallcode means. See a hrefhttpwyw.dcweb.cnstdcall.htm relnofollowherea for details, but basically MinGW mangles the name like codeFunctionncode and MSVC mangles it like codeFunctionncode. Its a good reason not to use codestdcallcode in your DLLs...p  pThe switch to codestdcallcode was important enough to the previous maintainers that they bumped a major version number because it broke ABI compatibility when they switched to it and Im reluctant to bump it again to switch back to codecdeclcode.p  pBasically, I need to convince MSVC to decorate the symbols in the DLL like MinGW does, either with some sort of alias, or just changing the name. I dont care which, as the other software in the suite can be easily rebuilt to call the DLL however is needed  its existing software Im worried about.p  pI suspect I need a .DEF file for this, but Im reluctant to make one by hand. Theres dozens of exported functions.p  pSo heres the question  is there any automated or mostlyautomated way to do thisp

Negative 9287 pI am trying to solve a problem offered by a jQuery textbook. It reads like this p  pThe data is submitted even though no entries have been made, to fix this you must stop the default action of the submit button. To do that, code the preventDefault method of the event object in the if statement at the end of the file, as in figure 106p  pnote heres what the code looks like in 106 thats not working for me when I tag it on to the end of my code as the book suggests.p  precodeif isValid  false  event.preventDefault  codepre  pRemember that the name that you use for the event object must be the same as the name of the parameter thats used for the submit event handler.p  pnote the submit event handler looks like thisp  precode    emailform.submit     function          var isValid  true                         the script proceeds to validate each text field accordingly                    bla bla bla codepre  pNow, test again with empty fields. This should display This field is required to the right of each field except the zip code field.p  pMy problem is that my preventDefault is not working and it will still submit no matter what I try.p  pAn interesting note from the text that explains figure 106 that may help, but that I dont quite understand is as follows. p  pHere you see a final if statement that is true if the isValid variable is false, which means that one or more fields are invalid. In that case, the preventDefault method of the event object is executed. This object is passed to the function for the submit event handler as a parameter thats stored in the event variable by the first line in this handler. If you dont use the preventDefault method when one or more fields are submitted to the server, the form will be submitted to the server since thats its default action.p  pAny insight would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 9287 pI have to fit a linear model with the same model matrix to multiple responses. This can be easily done in R by specifying the response as matrix instead of a vector. When done this way, the calculations are very fast.p  pNow I would also like to add weights to the model that correspond to the accuracy of responses. Therefore, for each response vector I would need also different weight vector. However, the codelmcode allows to enter the weights only as a vector not matrix.

This way the calculations would become much slower. p  pIs there any way run these type of models in batch mode, without calling codelmcode repeatedly p

Negative 9287 p[With apologies for a long, rambling question.  Im hoping to spark some discussionsuggestions from folks much more knowledgeable than I am.  If this really isnt appropriate for SO, please give me a hint where to ask this sort of question.]p  pI have an ASP.NET MVC 4 app.  Im using an Azure web role to host it for now, at least.  My app, which is a specialized medical interview, collects sensitive information from users and produces a report that is viewable by, and deliverable to via an encrypted PDF file attached to an unencrypted email doctors and patients.  The sensitive data is retained for 24 hours to allow doctors to come back and retrieve reports, after which time the records are deleted which, I know does not actually remove the data from persistent storage.p  pSo Im starting to think about what I need to worry about with regards to security boundaries to keep the confidential data confidential.  Im new to this whole web programming thing, although Im a very experienced desktop app developer.p  pThe first, obvious security boundary I need to worry about is the communication layer between the server and the users.  I have a valid, properly configured SSL certificate and all of the sections of the website that deal with loggedin users which includes the interview and reporting workflow operate over an HTTPS endpoint.p  pI am assuminghoping that Azure has its SSL implementation correct and that there is nothing that I can or should do to harden the host itself.p  pFor user convenience, I do allow visitors to browse to a hrefhttpmywebsite.com relnofollowhttpmywebsite.coma, and I redirect to a page marked with [RequiresHttps] if and when they are logged in. I understand that this HTTPtoHTTPS redirection is vulnerable to an a hrefhttpwww.windowsecurity.comarticlestutorialsauthenticationandencryptionUnderstandingManintheMiddleAttacksARPPart4.html relnofollowSSLStrip maninthemiddle attacka, in which the server sees a secure HTTPS connection but the vigilant user would notice that the URL is HTTP and not HTTPS. I plan to keep this convenience feature, but I will mitigate it by employing an extended validation certificate, which gives most users a happy, green address bar.  Ill put something on the main loggedinuser page that reminds the user to verify the green address bar.p  pIll figure out how to configure ASP.NET so that all of my cookies are encrypted.p  pIve enabled Remote Desktop in the Azure deployment wizard, so that opens up a portal that can be attacked if someone can figure out my username and password.  Cest la vie.p  pThe next security boundary I need to worry about  and this is where I need help  is protecting sensitive data in the event that an unauthorized person gains access to the database.  My knowledge of database administration is pretty much limited to copying and pasting connection strings and writing simple SQL queries.p  pIm using Entity Framework and Azure SQL Databases for all of my database stuff.  I encrypt the sensitive data in the data entities using a key baked into my code.  Presumably, the database itself is encrypted and someone who just got hold of the database files the Azure SQL Databases interface is accessible via a web connection, but only from trusted IP addresses would need to figure out my SQL username and password to pull the data out.p  pSomeone could presumably trick my app into revealing sensitive information.  My workflow only allows a logged in user to read and write his own records.  In order for an attacker to access the encrypted sensitive data, they would either need to get my encryption key or figure out a way to call into my code.  I have not obfuscated the .NET code strongI assume that my executables are secure.  I also assume that my cleartext web.config, which contains my database credentials, is secure.strong  Are these good assumptionsp  pSo, thats as far as my beginner brain has taken me down the security path.  Any comments or suggestions Have I made any incorrect assumptions or overlooked anything obviousp

Negative 9287 pI have been processing some ChIPseq data with spp. I looked through the literature and it seemed that spp is indicated as a good program to use ENCODE uses it. I have found and adapted the two tutorials I found for using spp, a hrefhttpssites.google.comabrown.edubioinformaticsinbiomedspprfromchipseq relnofollowhttpssites.google.comabrown.edubioinformaticsinbiomedspprfromchipseqa and a hrefhttpcompbio.med.harvard.eduSupplementsChIPseqtutorial.html relnofollowhttpcompbio.med.harvard.eduSupplementsChIPseqtutorial.htmla I have also read the paper...ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed19029915. I have also emailed Prof. Karchencko and posted on the bioconductor listserv  all with no response. My question is about the MSER and the predicted sequencing depth  additional output of spp. So what I think the MSER is, is the score value above which a peak is authoritatively determined When I look at peaks above this score value they are very well defined. Also, is the predicted sequencing depth is a prediction of the number of additional tags necessary so that the MSER and the FDR value coincide It is hard to find decent information about this program. Any advice or additional information is greatly appreciatedp  pTIAp

Also, the resource is not released and I have to reboot the phone to release it.p  pHere is the part of the code where the calls are done see Deitel et al., Android for Programmers, Prentice Hall, 2012, chap 16 p  precode startsstops a recording OnCheckedChangeListener recordButtonListener     new OnCheckedChangeListener          Override      public void onCheckedChangedCompoundButton buttonView,         boolean isChecked               if isChecked                     visualizer.clear  clear visualizer for next recording            saveButton.setEnabledfalse  disable saveButton            deleteButton.setEnabledfalse  disable deleteButton            viewSavedRecordingsButton.setEnabledfalse  disable               create MediaRecorder and configure recording options            if recorder  null               recorder  new MediaRecorder  create MediaRecorder             recorder.setAudioSourceMediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC            recorder.setOutputFormat               MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.THREEGPP            recorder.setAudioEncoderMediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AAC            recorder.setAudioEncodingBitRate16             recorder.setAudioSamplingRate44100             try                             create temporary file to store recording               File tempFile  File.createTempFile                  VoiceRecorder, .3gp, getExternalFilesDirnull                 store File as tag for saveButton and deleteButton                saveButton.setTagtempFile               deleteButton.setTagtempFile                 set the MediaRecorders output file               recorder.setOutputFiletempFile.getAbsolutePath               recorder.prepare  prepare to record                  recorder.start  start recording               recording  true  we are currently recording               handler.postupdateVisualizer  start updating view              end try            catch IllegalStateException e                            Log.eTAG, e.toString              end catch             catch IOException e                            Log.eTAG, e.toString              end catch                          end if         else                     recorder.stop  stop recording            recorder.reset  reset the MediaRecorder            recording  false  we are no longer recording            saveButton.setEnabledtrue  enable saveButton            deleteButton.setEnabledtrue  enable deleteButton            recordButton.setEnabledfalse  disable recordButton           end else        end method onCheckedChanged     end OnCheckedChangedListener codepre  pIn a debug session, the else scope is entered but it hangs on its first stop line.p  pI repeat, I know the phone and its OS are correct because another app works correctly. So, do you have any idea on how to solve this problem, a work around maybep  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong When the recorder is started, there is a handler that is executed at each 50ms to display a graph of the amplitude of the sound. The method recorder.getMaxAmplitude always returns 0. Maybe this is the symptom of a badly initialized MediaRecorderp

Negative 9287 pAFAIK codeCFHostcode offers the only empublic APIem on OS X and iOS for DNS resolution that is asynchronous andor can be canceled so it is possible to implement a custom timeout. All other APIs are synchronous and cannot be canceled, so one would have to emwaste one threadem per DNS lookup to make the operation asynchronous or stoppable even Grand Central Dispatch would waste one thread per lookup, you just dont have to create the threads yourself. Having one blocking thread per DNS resolution call and such a call can block rather long, on my system the timeout is 30 seconds before the call will ultimately timeout is really not the way to go if you need to resolve a huge number of DNS hostnames.p  pcodeCFHostcode seemed like a good workaround for me. It can be be used synchronously, in which case the documentation says the blocking request can be canceled from another thread, and it can be used asynchronously, in which case request is running in the background and also can be canceled, if desired, yet it will not block any thread until it succeeds or times out naturally. Internally codeCFHostcode uses codegetaddrinfoasynccode functions, yet this is not public API, to my knowledge these functions are private and one shouldnt use them directly.p  pSo here is a simple piece of code I wrote to test codeCFHostcode lookups with cancel, but it is not working as expected and I have no idea why.p  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltassert.hgt include ltdispatchdispatch.hgt include ltCoreServicesCoreServices.hgt  int main int argc, char  argv       CFHostRef host     dispatchtimet timeout     CFAbsoluteTime startTime     dispatchqueuet timeoutQueue      startTime  CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent      host  CFHostCreateWithNamekCFAllocatorDefault, CFSTRwww.apple.com     asserthost      timeout  dispatchtimeDISPATCHTIMENOW, 5  1000  1000  1000ull     timeoutQueue  dispatchgetglobalqueue         DISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0          asserttimeoutQueue      dispatchaftertimeout, timeoutQueue,                      printfu Timeout limit reached, canceling.n,                 unsignedCFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent  startTime                          CFHostCancelInfoResolutionhost, kCFHostAddresses                    printfu Starting name resolution.n,         unsignedCFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent  startTime          CFHostStartInfoResolutionhost, kCFHostAddresses, NULL     printfu Name resolution terminated.n,         unsignedCFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent  startTime           return 0  codepre  pIf the DNS servers are configured correctly, this code will resolve the name pretty fastp  precode0 Starting name resolution. 0 Name resolution terminated. codepre  pThis is expected. However, if I misconfigure DNS in my system, so all DNS queries will timeout, here is what I getp  precode0 Starting name resolution. 5 Timeout limit reached, canceling. 30 Name resolution terminated. codepre  pCancel timer is hit after 5 seconds and I cancel the request, yet the request will not stop, it will block for another 25 seconds. Actually if I dont cancel the request, it will also block for 30 seconds, since, as I said above, this is the natural DNS timeout of my system. So the call to codeCFHostCancelInfoResolutioncode does exactly strongNOTHINGstrong.p  pTo quote from Apples codeCFHostcode documentationp  blockquote   pstrongCFHostStartInfoResolutionstrongp      p[...]p      pIn synchronous mode, this function blocks until the resolution has   completed, in which case this function returns TRUE, until the   resolution is stopped by calling CFHostCancelInfoResolution from   another thread, in which case this function returns FALSE, or until an   error occurs.p blockquote  pOkay, I strongamstrong calling CFHostCancelInfoResolution from another thread, yet the function keeps blocking. Either this is a bug in the API, an error in the documentation, or Im too stupid to use this API correctly and there is something very fundamental Im overlooking here.p  h2Updateh2  pThis could actually really be a bug. I just tested the code above on 10.6 and it works exactly as expected, lookup is canceled after 5 seconds. On 10.7 and 10.8 the cancel call doesnt do anything, the code blocks until normal DNS timeout has been reached.p

Negative 9287 pIm currently writing a 3D renderer for fun and research, so I need a way to draw my framebuffer to a window. Since Im doing all of my calculations on CPU, the drawing needs to be as fast as possible. p  pOne of my goals is to use no existing graphics library OpenGLDirectX so the drawing to the screen is pure Win32. In my research Ive found a couple of ways to create and draw bitmaps and now Im looking for the best one.p  pMy current implementation uses a bitmap created with codeCreateDIBSectioncode, which is drawn to my window DC using codeBitBltcode. p  pcodeCreateDIBSectioncode give me a pointer to my bitmap bytes so I can manipulate it without copying. Using this method I achieve an update rate of about 260 FPS without any rendering done. This seems a bit slow, so Im looking for optimizations. p  pIve read something about that if you dont create a bitmap with the same palette as the system palette, some slow color conversions are done. p  pHow can I make sure my DIB bitmap and window are compatible p  pAre there methods of drawing an bitmap which are faster than my current implementation p  pIve also read something about codeDrawDibDrawcode, can anyone confirm that this is fasterp

Negative 9287 pI am attempting to make a custom hotkey that will go to the previous sheet viewed.p  pAs far as I understand, this would involve making a Class Module as a Worksheet object that will capture Sheet Change, Sheet Activate, and Sheet Deactivate Events.  Once the event has been captured, I would set the previous active worksheet to an object variable.  Then I would make a custom macro that would go to the previously set worksheet object once a hotkey is pressed.  Is this the right pathp  pAnd if it is the right path, where would I save the Macro code so that its usable by all future workbooks  I have a PERSONAL.xlsb file created and ready to edit.  Would I make the class module in PERSONAL.xlsb  How would I initialize the object in PERSONAL.xlsb when I create a new workbookp  pAnswers to these questions would be greatly appreciated, thank youp

Negative 9287 pIm not very experienced in batch programming. Ive sort of hobbled together various pieces of code but it does not quite work as I want it too.p  pHere is the problem. Log files are created in a directory. Some are multiple entries some are single entries. They all follow a specific pattern. F.ex.p  precode    START STRING 1234     NAME1 ADRESS1 ETC     NAME2 ADRESS2 ETC     NAME3 ADRESS3 ETC codepre  pSometimes there are more then one name entry in a single file, sometimes its just a single entry. All the files have the starting string. What I need to do is parse these log files and recreate them in another directory, one file for each name in a file, each in the format of a single named file. Using the above example, it would create 3 files, each looking like thisp  precode    START STRING     NAME ADRESS ETC codepre  pHere is the code sofar. It sort of works.. except when there is more then one log file in the directory at a time, I end up with a few entries with just two START STRING in them, which I need to avoid. In other words, I need it to go through each log file separately instead of, as I assume it does, treat all the log files as one single large text file.p  precode    Echo off     setlocal enableextensions enabledelayedexpansion       First find out how many lines a file has.

Negative 9287 pCurrently I have a JPA entity for a kind of tasks. Some processes write to that table, and a scheduled process works on that tasks, and changes the state when ready. I need to prioritize tasks, and to retry them with decreasing frequency if they fail. My environment is GlassFish 3  JPA via Hibernate  MySQL  XA transactions. In the medium term the project will replace GlassFish by a Spring solution using Jetty or so.p  pIt got this working somehow, but Im not really happy with it I get OptimisticLockExceptions, it looks like I didnt got the transactions right at some points, and JPA timers on GlassFish are also kind of messy if you need variable times. p  pI have the feeling Im using the wrong tools here, and that I should use some mature, stable design, not something clubbed together. Using JPA entities seems to be to heavyweight, but raw JDBC looks like an even worse choice. Of course I want to avoid heavy library dependencies, but maybe I overlook a simple canned solution for my specific problem which doesnt seem so unusual.p  p[Edit]p  pIn order to clarify I wont change the use case I dont even have the code anymore, I just want to get some general guidelines in order to do it right TM the next time.

Negative 9287 pThis is for the Gurus p p  pSo, I have tried out two approaches but I cant decide which one would do better generally as the size of input increases. p  pFirst the back storyp  pWe have products, and each product has a category path e.g. Accessoriesshoessneakers p  pI want to connect my products with their respective categories whilst keeping things compatible with the 3NF rules. p  pI can go about this two ways, I couldp  p1 Have a many to many relationship between products and categories by blowing up the category path into individual categories and forming an association in a many to many table p  pPros Simple and easy to understand.  Cons The manymany association grows exponentially You can imagine why, each product has multiple categories and the test case involved just 250,000 products. I can intuitively see that as the size of input increases the stress on the databases engine will increase.p  p2 Create a Many to Many relationship between categories paths and products and another many to many relationship between category paths and the actual categories. This makes sense to me since the categories paths in a test case of 250,000 products are limited to 13,000 unique instances and these paths associated with their actual categories in another many to many relationship dont exceed more than 61,000 rows.p  pPros Far fewer category associations for the database to swift through 61,000 associations as compared to 900,000 associations formed in the first technique  Cons Far more inner joins. Products are connected to category paths, which are in turn connected with categories in a many to many relation ship. p  pWhich of these techniques do you think would be more suitable I need FAST retrievals, therefore fast select statements should be the main criteria.p  pThanks for going through this. I realize that  lot of this depends on proper indexing, but in the first scenario the size of rows grows by a factor of 3 at the very least where as in the second scenario there are so many inner joins that I fear the speed of retrieval is being negatively affected.p

I have the data stored in a simple NSData instance. I wish to use that public key to encode 16 bytes of data and return those over the network.

However, their code presents a problem. Every time I want to use a public key I need to add it to the keychain and give it a unique identifier. The problem with this is that this key is to be used strongonly oncestrong. I am looking for a way to obtain a SecKeyRef for a key that is not in the keychain and is created from an ASN.1 encoded key.p  pI have also considered the possibility of converting it to common PEM by base64encoding and wrapping it in BEGIN PUBLIC KEY and END PUBLIC KEY and then loading it into a SecKeyRef, but I havent seen a way to do this either.p  pAlso, I dont have much of a choice in the type of key, key format, etc. Its from a 3rd party java server.

On both Firefox and Chrome I am getting a weird Foreign Key error when I try to test that a superuser can change a normal users status to staff I assume this is all verified via Djangos internal testing, but thought it would be good practice to include it in my apps testing since my user scenarios depend on the functionality. It almost looks like Django doesnt like Selenium saving anything to the database This one error trickles down to my other tests, too, so it seems like something breaks behind the sceneslike Selenium loses its database connection. Does anyone know why this happens Im willing to dump the test in favor of assuming that the functionality works, but would love to fix this and use the test.p  pOne possible symptom is that in Chrome, between between the outputs of checked the box and clicked the save button, I get a broken pipe does not happen in Firefox.p  pIt seems to break around here, whenever Selenium clicks the save buttonp

Negative 9287 pBear with me. This is my first post...p  pThe Tor project has recently introduced Stem as a loadable python module. Ive been playing around with it to see if its a viable tool.

It always fails on me.

With setconf, I can set the HiddenServiceDir but it still fails the same when setting the port, making me think I have a fundamental misunderstanding of Tor.p  pI checked my circuits and it doesnt seem to matter if I have one with a hidden service rendezvous point it keeps failing. Id prefer to keep things pythonic, temporal and clean and not have a hacked up bash script that rewrites the torrc before restarting tor. In a perfect world, Id rather not write to a hidden service directory, but tor hasnt implemented that yet.p  pI try to be as crossplatform as possible, but Im running Linux with Tor 2.3.25...p  pSo who has ideas of why Stem wont let me make a hidden servicep

Negative 9287 pSuppose I have an array codeadataarray[0.5, 1.,2.,3.,6.,10.]code and I want to calculate log likelihood of Weibull distribution of this array, given the parameters code[5.,1.5]code and code[5.1,1.6]code.

Negative 9287 pI have a border below my li elements in the wordpress widget types that would be appropriate. The a element inside is then set to block so that it gives them a nice easy to click full width.p  pThe problem, when you choose the option show post count when adding a widget such as categories or archives it displays the post count as plain text after the a tag and because the a tag is block it pushes the post number text to the line below.p  pWhether you choose to show post count or not show post count it still gives you the exact same element identifyer for example widgetcategories.

Negative 9287 pIm new to MATLAB, and I have a set of data that I need to plot on a histogram. Furthermore, based on the estimated standard deviation and mean of my sample, I need to overlay a Gaussian with these parameters onto the figure. Finally, I would like to plot vertical lines that indicate the mean and  1 standard deviation. What is the best way to do so I have tried using the codehistfitcode function, but then on the figure when trying to add the vertical bars for the standard deviation ToolsData Statistics, the std value is not the same as that calculated by codestddatacode I would like to know why. Does anybody know of a way to do all of thisp  pThanksp

As we know that CPU speed increases with rise in external temperature. So, there lies a relationship between roomtemperature and CPU speed, as a result computers performance decreases.p  pI want such an algorithm which may tell me relationship between two fields whether they are directly proportional to each other or inversely and what happens with third parameter computers performance with change in other two parameters roomtemperature and CPU speed.

Negative 9287 pWe recently started using Dynamic Data templates on our website, by manually scaffolding certain tables, using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.ui.datacontrolextensions.enabledynamicdata28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeEnableDynamicDatacode extension methoda and passing the types of our models on certain GridViewsDetailsViews etc.p  pThis actually works quite nicely and is in production already on a couple of select pages. This method uses only the information in the type itself to create a codeMetaTablecode containing all the metadata useful to generate the dynamic fields and filters on a bunch of pages.p  pI noticed that this scaffolding mechanism is quite limited though, since it does not take relationships with other types into account understandably so, since there is no contextual information at all.p  pNow comes the question is it possible to generate the whole MetaModel from an interface for instance In our web application, we are not accessing the codeDbContextcode directly at all. We exposed our context using the OData protocol through a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudiocc66879228vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowWcf Data Servicesa in another module, and the website requests the info via a new DataSource control we devised to communicate with Wcf Data via urls.p  pSince we are very new to DynamicData, I couldnt find a way of doing this myself. The very first thing I tried was to create my own codeMetaModelcode instance using information from two related types, but I failed at it since there doesnt seem to be a way to manually generate that. Initially, what I wanted is the equivalent of something like thisp  precodegridview.EnableDynamicDatatypeofDevice gridview.EnableDynamicDatatypeofDeviceType codepre  pThere is a oneone relation between codeDevicecode and codeDeviceTypecode in our model, and I needed to show fields from both models in the same grid in a page. I immediately noticed that the second call was overriding the first registration because errors popped up. I then took a look at the disassembled code to find out how it actually worked, and it became clear I wouldnt be able to use this method at all.p  pAt this point, I delved a bit on the whole MetaTableMetaModel classes to find out if I could then create the tables myself. By using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd98945828vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowMetaTable.CreateTable methoda, I can easily create a single MetaTable out of a type, but I fail to see how to create the relationships myself still.p  pThe most elegant way seems to be to go all out on the scaffolding mechanism, and register the whole context on the Global.asax. I then realized that I need the whole codeDbContextcode type and instance to generate the MetaModel.p  pThe whole problem here is responsibility I dont want to expose the codeDbContextcode to the web application at all. It will not access the database. All it has is a url to the data service and the models that are returned by it in a shared assembly. At the same time, I need the metadata with the relationships to generate the UI seamlessly.p  pWhat alternatives do I have to keep things separated here The website would ideally use the full scaffolding system without having a dependency on the codeDbContextcode implementation and connectionstrings etc. I thought about creating an interface to expose the relationships, kind of a fake datacontext, but all the registration methods I looked at, like a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc68051128vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowMetaModel.RegisterContexta, test the type passed to them checking if it is either a codeDataContextcode or codeObjectContextcode, and also try to create an instance of it which makes the use of abstract classes impossible too.p  pBy using full scaffolding like this, we also have the advantage of getting default values automatically from the querystring etc, without having to write code like this on every pagep  precodevar table  MetaTable.CreateTabletypeof Device var defaultValues  table.GetColumnValuesFromRouteHttpContext.Current gridview.SetMetaTabletable, defaultValues codepre  pPerhaps it would even be possible to create the codeMetaModelcode in the server and expose it via a custom Wcf Service I would then call this service in the web application startup to register the whole thing in a single go or something to that effect.p  pWe are currently using Asp.Net 4 .Net 4.0 WebForms on the web layer and Entity Framework 5 Code First for the model mapping.p

MyModelBodyClass extends MageCoreModelAbstract      var rows VarienDataCollection    protected rows    public function deleteRowindex      thisgtrowsgtremoveItemByKeyindex      return this       public function getHeight      return thisgtrowsgtgetSize       ... codepre  pCode limited for brevity.p  pSo if you call my codedeleteRowcode method, the item will in fact be removed from the collection, but subsequent calls to get the size of that collection will always return the original count. strongTherefore, if I have 25 items in the collection, and remove 1, then a call to codegetSizecode on the collection returns 25strong.p  pI traced this back to the parent class, in codeVarienDataCollectiongetSizecodep  precode   Retrieve collection all items count     return int   public function getSize      thisgtload     if isnullthisgttotalRecords          thisgttotalRecords  countthisgtgetItems          return intvalthisgttotalRecords  codepre  pWe see that the count hinges on the NULL status of the codetotalRecordscode property. So it looks like a bug in core code. Am I reading this correctly Should I just rely on a call to codecountcode on the itemsp

Negative 9287 pRecently I was playing around with a custom modal and I was having difficulty with dismissing it.p  pBasically there is an anchor tag with an absolute position placed on a div with a relative position.

Negative 9287 pI want to set the default value of my primary key of a table in SQL database with newid via Entity Framework 6 Code First. I know how this is done via code and also found some approaches on stackoverflow, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18200817howtosetnewidforguidinentityframeworkHow to set NewId for GUID in entity frameworkap  pBUT I have a backuprestore mechanism which inserts the the data not via objects but just as a bulge to the database. So no Entity Framework is used here. That means that a row with a null as guid will be inserted in the SQL database and fails.p  pIt is possible to add the Annotation p  precode[DatabaseGeneratedAttributeDatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity]     public NullableltGuidgt EntityOID  get set  codepre  pAnd this will successfully add NEWSEQUENTIALID as default value, which does a similar thing as newid it adds a new guid which is higher than the recent guids, so you win perfomance because you have a order in the input.  But because this is a database which already exist without EF I want to do as few changes as possible. So Im not excactly happy with NEWSEQUENTIALID. I would rather like it if it were still just newid. But I havent found any AnnotationMapping for newid in Entity Framework 6 Code First. And by design all changes to the database have to be done via code. Does anyone know how to add the default value newid to the row via codep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 9287 pI am moving an app between organizations and running into a problem where the crashlytics plugin for eclipse using kepler wont finish its onboarding process to the new account.p  pIve read through their a hrefhttpsupport.crashlytics.comknowledgebasearticles130381howdoitransfermyapptoanotherorganization relnofollowsupport pagea on how to accomplish that but cannot finish the onboarding process to the new account because the plugin interface seems to only work with the old api key, and therefore I cant get it past the WAIT status after I launch my app because the api key is wrong for the new account.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKgk4b.png altenter image description herep  pWhat Ive observed is that each time I tried to start the onboarding flow with the plugin it inserts the old api key into my manifest. p  pStuff Ive triedp  ol liprevert all code changes from first crashlytics integration AND uninstall the crashlytics eclipse plugin and reinstall it, then go through onboarding flow again by logging in to the new account I logged via safari to add the new app, I am not asked to login via the plugin again which is really strange.pli liptry to manually change the crashlytics api key in android manifest. This doesnt work because the plugin will make its own changes to the android manifest and insert the old api key again.pli lipmanually change the api key again and just run that version without restarting the onboarding flow in the plugin.pli ol  pThe app has been removed from the old crashlytics account already.p  pHow can I change the api key that the plugin is working withp

Negative 9287 pIm reading a hrefhttpjoyofclojure.com relnofollowThe Joy of Clojurea, and in the section about paralellization, the functions codepvaluescode, codepmapcode and codepcallscode are explained, with a brief example of how each one is used. Below are the examples given for codepvaluescode and codepcallscodep  precodedefn sleeper [s thing] Threadsleep  1000 s thing  pvalues   sleeper 2 1st   sleeper 3 2nd   keyword 3rd  pcalls   sleeper 2 1st   sleeper 3 2nd   keyword 3rd codepre  pI understand the technical difference between the two  codepvaluescode takes a variable number of values to be computed, whereas codepcallscode takes an arbitrary number of functions taking no arguments, to be called in parallel. In both cases, a lazy sequence of the results is returned.p  pMy question is essentially, when would you use one vs. the other It seems like the only semantic difference is that you stick a codecode before each argument to codepcallscode, turning it into an anonymous function. So, purely from the perspective of saving keystrokes and having simpler code, wouldnt it make more sense to just use codepvaluescode  and if so, why even have a codepcallscode functionp  pI get that with codepcallscode, you can substitute a symbol referring to a function, but if you wanted to use such a function with codepvaluescode, you could just put the function in parentheses so that it is called. p  pIm just a little confused as to why Clojure has these 2 functions that are so similar. Is there anything that you can do with one, but not the other Some contrived examples might be helpful.p

It was found       that when receiving two updates in quick succession, the loader would call onCanceled after        the second update in order to try to stop the previous load. Whenever onCanceled was called,       the loader would stop refreshing.               And the reason for this The support library version of Loader does not support onCanceled        Thanks to this answer on stack overflow for bringing up the issue  httpstackoverflow.coma15449553       By examining the API for the support library and the API 11 versions of Loader, it is clear that       we shouldnt be receiving onCanceled calls here, but we still do              Also important to note is that even on Android 3.0 and up, the framework will still use the        support library methods for Loader.              So we simply swallow this onCanceled call and dont call the super method. This seems to fix        the issue  it may also work if we simply remove onCanceled completely, but not 100 sure.                  Attempt to cancel the current asynchronous load.     super.onCanceleddata       The load has been canceled, so we should release the associated resources             Uncommenting this line of code does not resolve my issue     releaseResourcesdata   Override public void forceLoad      Log.iLOGTAG, forceLoad called     super.forceLoad   private void releaseResourcesListltItemgt data       All resources associated with the Loader should be released here.     if data  null          data.clear         data  null        codepre  pNow, while the UI is still updating properly the Logs show the following sequence of events p  precode0303 172333.859 ICustomLoader20663 forceLoad called 0303 172333.859 ICustomLoader20663 Load in background called... 0303 172333.864 ICustomLoader20663 Delivering results to the LoaderManager. 0303 172333.864 DCustomFragment20663 onLoadFinished for loaderid 0 0303 172333.869 ICustomLoader20663 Releasing any old data associated with this Loader. codepre  pwhenever the data is updated.p  pAt the point that the UI stops updating it seems as though codeforceLoadcode keeps on getting called every time the data changes it doesnt seem to actually accomplish anything i.e. codeloadInBackgroundcode doesnt get called.

Negative 9287 pI am new to Cucumber and I am using cucumberjava. The cucumber feature files look great. However, the reuse of step definitions really gets in the way about organizing the step definition code. The most intuitive way for me to organize the step definitions is just to follow the organization of the feature files, namely, one class for one feature. However, this way is screwed if there are two identical steps in two feature files, because you will miss one step in one of the classes, which breaks the coherence of the entire structure. However, I cannot convince myself to use other ways right now. So, what is a sensible way to organize step definitions when using cucumberjavap  pThank you very much.p

Negative 9287 pFor coding practice, Im making a simple game where a gun, when clicked, will shoot a little red bullet at a moving target. In order for there to be any type of game, the changing positions of the bullet and target need to be compared so when an overlap of divs occurs collision between bullet and target, it can be added to a conditional statement in order for points to score for instance. p  pThe best way I can think to do this is by using a while loop when the gun is clicked to continually check the position of the two divs. However, when I run a test with console.log, the position of the bullet is always the same, despite the fact that the bullet is animating.

Negative 9287 pI have two tables named ServiceIOD and ServiceSubs and between them only one column named ShortCode is common. So, when I try to join these two tables to get the combined result for some given short code it is not giving me the correct output. May be it is because the ShortCode column is holding redundant data for both table. For example we can find shortcode36788 multiple times in both tables for multiple rows. The query I tried so far is as belowp  precode SELECT distinct serviceIOD.keyword,          serviceIOD.shortcode     FROM serviceIOD          INNER JOIN serviceSubs              ON serviceIOD.shortcode  serviceSubs.shortcode              AND serviceIOD.shortcode  36788 codepre  pI would appreciate any sort of help from you all.

Negative 9287 pIm looking for some ideas about how to implement some kind of contest.p  pSo our visitors have this option that after they enter some valid code they enter to some contest. We save this and pick our big winner later on. Thats easy and its done.p  pNow they want to add this kind of extra step after they do the previous to participate for some kind of directprizes, where i will need to do some kind roll and tell them if they win one of this other extra prizes.p  pCurrently the only info ive available is a mysql table with the list of direct prizes, and another with the codes who are on the list for our final big contest Also i will have to giveaway 3 of these smallrandomprizes each day after launch. Also this way winners will be picker very quickly first couple days since there are more available.p  pSo i was thinking to do some kind of mysql rand on the prizes table, and if the result isnt a prize already took  associate it to our the code they entered on the previous stepmysql table.p  pBut ive the feeling this is going to happen right after launchday and then during the day other users will stand no chance since its going to have a lot of traffic, especially the first couple days where the first user will be winner NO matter what.... adn very likely our 2nd and 3rd since all prizes will be available by the time.p  pSo i was thinking to add some kind of date component to the rand or date since last winner.... here is where my mind starts thinking too much.p  pMaybe someone who already done something like this may have some better ideap  pThanks for any advice,p

Negative 9287 pI have a folder with about 4000 image files. I need to select some of those files, based on whether their names appear in an excel spreadsheet, and copy them to a new folder. If possible, I would also like to tag them with a color tag so I know which files in the original folder were moved and which were not. I got the code below from a hrefhttpsdiscussions.apple.comthread3887787tstart0 relnofollowherea.p  precodetell application Microsoft Excel tell worksheet 1 of active workbook     set fileList to value of used range end tell end tell  set rootFolder to pathtosourcefolder as POSIX file set filesToMove to  repeat with thisItem in fileList try     set end of filesToMove to alias rootFolder amp thisItem on error     display dialog File  amp thisItem amp  is not in the folder end try end repeat  tell application Finder move filesToMove to folder pathtodestination as POSIX file end tell codepre  pWhen I run it, its unable to find any of the files. I think the issue might have to do with using codecode in my file path instead of codecode but I dont know how to set a path to an external drive with the applescript syntax. Using the same variable declaration, codeset rootFolder to pathtosourcefolder as POSIX filecode, and then telling finder to codeopen rootFoldercode works fine. p  pI also need the script to have more flexibility  not all files have the same naming conventions, and so I need it to search for any files whose names contain the identifiers from the spreadsheet, but may not match it exactly. I.E. the spreadsheet entry may be 00103, but the file name is PX00103KL.jpg.p  pIn the meantime, Ive created an automator workflow that moves and tags the files exactly the way I want, but only after I manually enter the search string. If I could combine those two ideas, of iterating through the spreadsheet entries in excel and using each in turn as input for the automator workflow, that would be ideal. p  pThanks for any helpp

The Deletion for the codemWidgetQWebView pointercode is being called when the MyClass object is deleted. Here is the process of how it is called.  p  p1. MyClass is instantiated as mclass.  p  p2. after instantiation, the playHtml method above is called on mclass object  p  p3. the playHtml method above takes the full path to an html file that resides in a selfcontained folder, the wh are the predetermined dimensions of the html content are used in scaling  p  p4. after about 25 seconds, the mclass object is deleted  p  p4a. during those 25 seconds the playHtml method scales the html content appropriately, and loads the html file. A lot of javascript happens for animation, etc.p  p5. after the deletion another instantiation of MyClass occurs and the process is repeatedp  pthis process can be repeated literally 3000 times in a day, one after another. Neither the cpu nor ram are taxed during this time. The only thing I left out of the process above is the logging.

Negative 9287 pstrongEndgoalstrong BASH script that is waiting for background jobs to finish does not abort on first codeCtrlccode instead, it requires a second codeCtrlccode to quit.p  pIm well aware of how the BASHbuiltin codetrapcode works. You can eitherp  ol lipUse it to ignore a signal altogether e.g., codetrap  2code ... orpli lipUse it to have arbitrary commands executed before a signals original function is allowed to happen e.g., codetrap cmd 2code, where codecmdcode is run before the parent script will be interrupted due to codeSIGINTcodepli ol  pSo the question boils down to thisp  blockquote   pHow can I effectively combine strong1strong amp strong2strong together, i.e., prevent the endresult a signal would lead to strong1strong  e.g., stop script cancelling due to codeSIGINTcode while also making that signal cause something else strong2strong  e.g., increment a counter, check the counter and conditionally either print a warning or exit.p blockquote  pPut more simplyp  blockquote   pHow can I make a signal do something else entirely not just insert a job before it does its thing.p blockquote  pHeres some example code to demonstrate what Im aiming at however, it of course doesnt work  because codetrapcode can only do strong1strong or strong2strong from above.p  precodebinbash declare i numberoftimestraptriggered cleanupbgjobs      numberoftimestraptriggered1     if [[ numberoftimestraptriggered eq 1 ]] then         echo There are background jobs still running         echo Hit Ctrlc again to cancel all bg jobs amp quit     else         echo Aborting background jobs         for pid in bgjobs do echo   Killing pid kill 9 pid done     fi  f  sleep 5m  trap cleanupbgjobs 2 bgjobs for job in 1 2 3 do     f amp     bgjobs  done wait codepre  pSo this is the output you end up getting when you press codeCtrlccode once.p  precode[rsaw] .zax  CThere are background jobs still running Hit Ctrlc again to cancel all bg jobs amp quit [rsaw] ps axftail 6  24569 pts3    S      000 binbash .zax 24572 pts3    S      000   sleep 5m 24570 pts3    S      000 binbash .zax 24573 pts3    S      000   sleep 5m 24571 pts3    S      000 binbash .zax 24574 pts3    S      000   sleep 5m codepre  pOf course I could modify that to clean up the jobs on the first codeCtrlccode, but thats not what I want.

Negative 9287 pI used to dynamically populate a Table Layout with different elements per row, among them a Spinner. To handle the initialization of spinner values i used what most recommended a boolean flag variable. The code went something like thisp  precodepublic class spinnerHandling implements OnItemSelectedListener     public void dynamicallyPopulateTableLayoutint a       ...       initialize spinner with default values       mySpinner.setSelectiona               mySpinner.setTagtrue       mySpinner.setOnItemSelectedListenerthis       ...        Override    public void onItemSelectedAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int position,            long id        ifBooleanparent.getTag          my code          ...              parent.setTagfalse      codepre  pThis worked fine. Later i decided that i should use a List View instead of a Table Layout. For that i have a custom ArrayAdapter that uses a row Layout, in which of course i have a Spinner, to populate the List View. As those of you who are familiar with List Views, understand its complex dynamic behavior, would know that the somehow static turn around of the boolean flag method wont work. After three days of tremendous headache trying to find a way to resolve this issue, i just came across the spinners isDirty method that in contrast with isPressed, isSelected, etc. actually changes its boolean values when spinner item is selected by user. the code is something like thisp  precodepublic class spinnerHandling implements OnItemSelectedListener      public void dynamicallyPopulateListViewint a       ...        initialize spinner with default values       mySpinner.setSelectiona         mySpinner.setOnItemSelectedListenerthis       ...        Override    public void onItemSelectedAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int position,            long id        ifparent.isDirty          my code          ...             codepre  pThis seems to work fine But i would like to make sure that isDirty handles properly spinner initialization and user selection. Can you please confirm or contradict this behavior Thank you.p

Negative 9287 pjust found out how to write and read to a csv file. Its very helpful, but im having some trouble with it.  I noticed that when I scroll down in the csv file, it creates new lines, which then messes up when I want to append data to the csv file it shows up at the bottom of a bunch of empty lines.  So what I plan on doing is  Going down the document until it finds an empty row and get that line number with the linenum  reader object. So then I would just need to be able to write to a specific line. Is that possible p  pI have been using this webpage as a guide. a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3librarycsv.html relnofollowhttpsdocs.python.org3librarycsv.htmlap

Negative 9287 pI am looking for a fast and efficient way to compute the problem described below. Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advancep  pI have a couple of very large csv files that have different information about the same object, but in my final calculation I need all of the attributes in the different table. I am trying to calculate the load of a large number of electrical substations, first I have a list of unique electrical substationsp  precodeUniqueSubstations lt data.frameName  cSubA, SubB, SubC, SubD codepre  pIn another list I have information about the customers behind these substationsp  precodeCustomerInformation lt data.frame   Customer  10011010,    SubStNm  sampleuniqueUniqueSubstationsName, 10, replace  TRUE,    HouseHoldType  sample12, 10, replace  TRUE  codepre  pAnd in another list I have information about the, lets say, solar panels on these customers roofs for different yearsp  precodeSolarPanels lt data.frame   Customer  sample10011010, 10, replace  TRUE,    SolarPanelYear1  sample1020, 10, replace  TRUE,    SolarPanelYear2  sample1520, 10, replace  TRUE  codepre  pNow I want see what the load is for each substation for each year. I have a household load and a solar panel load normalised for each type of household or the solarpanelp  precodeSolarLoad lt data.frameLoad  c0, 10, 10, 5 HouseHoldLoad lt data.frameType1  c1, 3, 5, 2, Type2  c3, 5, 6, 1 codepre  pSo now I have to match up these listsp  precodeMLSubStCust lt sapplyUniqueSubstationsName,                          functionx whichCustomerInformationSubStNm in x  TRUE  MLCustSolarP lt sapplyCustomerInformationCustomer,                           functionx whichSolarPanelsCustomer in x  TRUE codepre  pHere I use the codewhichxxx in x  TRUEcode method because I need multiple matches and codematchcode only returns one matchp  pAnd now we come to my big question but probably not my only problem with this method at last. I want to calculate the maximum load on each substation for each year. To this end I had first written a for loop that looped through the UniqueSubstations list, which is of course highly inefficient. After that I tried to speed it up using codeoutercode but I dont think I have properly vectorized my function. My maximum function looks as follows I only wrote it out for the solar panel part to keep it simplep  precodeGetMax lt functioni, Yr    maxsumSolarPanels[unlistMLCustSolarP[MLSubStCust[[i]]], use.names FALSE,Yr]SolarLoad  codepre  pIm sure this is not efficient at all but I have no clue how to do it in any other way. p  pTo get my final results I use a outer functionp  precodeResults lt outer1nrowUniqueSubstations, 12, VectorizeGetMax codepre  pIn my example all of these data frames are much much larger 40000 rows each or so, so I really need some good optimization of the functions involved. I tried to think of ways to vectorize the function but I couldnt work it out. Any help would be appreciated.p  pEDITp  pNow that I fully understand the accepted awnser I have another problem. My actual codeCustomerInformationcode is 188k rows long and my actual codeHouseHoldLoadcode is 53k rows long. Needless to say this does not codemergecode very well. Is there another solution to this problem that does not require codemergecode or for loops that are too slowp

Negative 9287 pIm using Ruby on Rails to build a realtime game web app. When a player taps Play Now, I want to match them up with another player that is looking for a game matchmaking. With my basic understanding of RoR, one immediate way I think I can do this is create a DB table that contains the players that are looking for a game. When a new player wants to play, I can just query the DB for the two most recent players and connect them together, and remove them from the DB. But this doesnt sound optimal since the list of players can potentially be large and the query could be slow. p  pAre there more efficient ways to implement this kind of matchmaking in RoR Or a more efficient way to implement a persistent queuep  pOther ideasp

Negative 9287 pIve been really stuck with this question and I just cant seem to get to the bottom of it.. I have an activity which sets the contentview to a relative layout that has a menu layout and a surfaceview layout.. I want the menu layout to be gone until the back button is pressed or the app loses focus, which seems to work.. so the resume buttone is supposed to hide the menu again and resume the thread.. The thread resumes, but it does not hide the menu layout and the surfaceview does not respond to my touch events.. This seems to me that the surfaceview just loses focus.. But how would I go about doing that because surfaceview.requestfocus doesnt seem to help.. Any help would be appreciated Thanks... Maybe Im going about this the wrong way... maybe not by any insight would be greatly appreciated  Here is the layout of my activityp  precode ltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidididnewgamelayout     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidbackgroundcolorblack     androidgravitycenter     toolscontext.NewGame gt         ltcom.matthofr.masterpongblaster.MainUI         androidididmainui         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent gt     ltcom.matthofr.masterpongblaster.MainUIgt          ltRelativeLayout             androidididpausemenu             androidlayoutwidth150dp             androidlayoutheight150dp             androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue             androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue             androidbackgrounddrawablemenuback             androidorientationvertical              gt              ltTextView                 androidididtextView2                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutalignRightidtextView1                 androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue                 androidtextSettings                 androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceLarge                 androidtextColorcolorblack gt              ltTextView                 androidididtextView3                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue                 androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue                 androidlayoutmarginBottom15dp                 androidtextQuit                 androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceLarge                 androidtextColorcolorblack gt              ltTextView                 androidididtextView1                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutalignParentToptrue                 androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue                 androidlayoutmarginTop16dp                 androidclickabletrue                 androidonClickgameresume                 androidtextResume                 androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceLarge                 androidtextColorcolorblack gt         ltRelativeLayoutgt    ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pHere is the Activity.java filep  precode    package com.matthofr.masterpongblaster   import android.app.Activity import android.content.Intent import android.graphics.Rect import android.os.Bundle import android.text.Layout import android.util.Log import android.view.Gravity import android.view.KeyEvent import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams import android.view.WindowManager import android.view.Window import android.view.WindowManager import android.widget.FrameLayout import android.widget.LinearLayout import android.widget.RelativeLayout  public class NewGame extends Activity       RelativeLayout linear     View linnn     SaveLoadState saveandload     int mainwidth     int mainheight     RelativeLayout pausemenu     Bundle bundle     boolean windowclosed  false     Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          Bundle bundle  getIntent.getBundleExtrabundle         this.bundle  bundle          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         requestWindowFeatureWindow.FEATURENOTITLE         getWindow.setFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGFULLSCREEN,                                  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGFULLSCREEN          setContentViewR.layout.activitynewgame          linear  RelativeLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.newgamelayout         MainUI main  MainUI findViewByIdR.id.mainui         main.setnewgamethis          Show the Up button in the action bar.

Negative 9287 pIm currently enrolled in a web design course, and one of our assignments is to come up with two CSS3 properties that are NOT compatible with every major browser IE, Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. Easy as cake, right CSS3 is relatively new, there must be dozens of properties that arent fully supported. And I was wrong. Ive barely been able to find ANY such properties, and all except ONE of the properties Ive found have been unsuitable, because the second half of the assignment is to create a jQuery fallback that duplicates their functionality, regardless of browser. It also has to actually make sense to use jQuery for the issue for instance, you cant just use jQuery to change a textstroke to a dropshadow, since thats mainly just CSS. jQuery needs to be the major player. It also needs to work without needless extra HTML  for example, if its an image effect, it needs to work straight on the image, not necessitate putting the image inside a canvas element first.p  pThe resize property is the one example Ive found thats worked. Its not supported in IE at all, but jQuery handles it no problem in any problem. Unfortunately, every single other thing Ive tried has not had a remotely suitable fallback option in jQuery. My first thought was to use image filters, such as sepia and blur, which are new in CSS3 and currently not supported in Firefox or IE  however, every single piece of jQuery, plugins or code snippets or what have you, has not worked at all, mainly because all they do is use the webkitfilter and filter property, which, as you know, is not supported at all in Firefox or IE, hence why Im trying to do it WITHOUT CSS in the first placep  pAnd virtually every single thing Ive found has been like that. The CSS is either supported everywhere, or if its not, there doesnt appear to be ANY functionality within jQuery to duplicate ANY of it without using the same unsupported CSSp  pIm honestly at the end of my rope here. Im out of ideas and I havent found anything except the resize property. I need one CSS property, that is not compatible with every major browser, that jQuery can duplicate WITHOUT using the same unsupported CSS property. Any and all answers and suggestions are greatly, greatly appreciated.p  pTLDR strongAre there any CSS3 features that are not supported by all major browsers but can be replicated through the use of jQuerystrongp

Negative 9287 pI was naively excited to practice DDD on my current project, so I began by recognizing and grooming our ubiquitous language, and I created experimental domain models for a couple subdomains.  However, I encountered difficulty when I tried to implement certain setters and repositories.p  pI want my domain model to encapsulate the business logic, but Im constrainted to a data API that performs a majority of our business logic, including enforcing invariants, on another server.  The API also does not expose the model and operations at the level of granularity suggested by the ubiquitous language.  Some pieces of data required for the business logic arent even exposed by the API.p  pThese infrastructural concerns are poised to pollute my domain model and render it anemic.  Building an anticorruption layer would be a daunting task and likely require hacking against the API.  It seems that I must abandon DDD and instead build an anemic model with service classes. What principles, patterns, or practices should employ for this scenariop  pThe best I can find is the notion of the conformist in Eric Evans emDomainDriven Design Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Softwareem.  He describes my situation as an upstreamdownstream relationship in which the upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream teams needs, and in which an interface tailored to the needs of the downstream team is not in the cards.  He recommends, Eliminate the complexity [of an anticorruption layer] by slavishly adhering to the model of the upstream team.p  pEvans goes on to acknowledge the pitfalls of the conformist approach.  Itp  ul licramps the style of the downstream designersli lidoes not yield the ideal model for the applicationli lilimits your application to the capabilities of the upstream model  plus purely additive enhancementsli liis very unappealing emotionally my favoriteli ul  pI would appreciate further insight, particularly into useful codedesign techniques for this kind of conformity.p

Negative 9287 pIm doing the exercises from SICP not homework and exercise 2.20 introduces dottedtail notation, which is where you use codedefine f a . b ...code to pass a variable number of arguments which end up in a list codebcode. This problem in particular wants a procedure which takes an integer codeacode and returns a list of all arguments with parity equal to codeacodes. The problem is not difficult here is my solutionp  precodedefine sameparity a . b a is an int, b is any number of int arguments   let parity remainder a 2     define proc li       cond null li null              If parity of the head of the list is  parity of a,              remainder car li 2 parity               keep it and check the rest of the list.              cons car li proc cdr li              Otherwise ignore it and check the rest of the list.             else proc cdr li     cons a proc b codepre  pMy question is that I dont seem to be using the dottedtail feature at all. I might as well have just accepted exactly two arguments, a number and a list Im effectively wrapping the algorithm in a procedure codeproccode which does away with the dottedtail thing. p  pBefore I wrote this solution, I wanted to have a recursive call resemblingp  pcodesameparity a . cdr bcodep  por something spiritually similar, but no matter how I tried it, I kept passing lists of lists or extra procedures or whatever. This could be because I dont know emexactlyem what code.code does, only what I want it to do the Racket docs didnt clear anything up either. To sum up,p  pstrongIs my solution what was intended for this exercise, or is there a way to actually use the dot notation which seems to be the point of the exercise in the algorithmstrongp

Negative 9287 pI am working with Maven and Jacoco to generate code coverage reports. currently I am generating integration test code coverage with javaagent. Our Integration tests check a couple of configurations and I am currently generating a separate exec file for every configuration. p  pMy first attempt was to set up the javaagent to write to the same file with appendtrue but this caused jacocoreport to throw errors since there were multiple identifiers for the classpaths.p  pReading around it seems like the most common way to combine these would be to pass the individual exec files into sonar, but I cannot seem to find anyone that has multiple integration test exec files to merge and I am worried that I will run into a similar class path identifier issue. Any advice would be appreciated. p  pEdit I played with the files the java agent outputs. The conflict for the report generation is that it generates several files that have the following formp  precode Proxy.identifier.class codepre  pthe problem the report generation runs into is that these files have the same beginning, i.e. I can and often do have multiple Proxy5... files. the identifier after the first . is always unique, but the report generator does not seem to parse the file name that far. When I rename or delete these files to remove the conflicts the report generator sees the report generation runs as it normally would. p  pThe downside I am a little too new to jacoco to know if what I am doing to get the report is compromising the output of jacoco in a significant way. p  pFurthermore, removing information seems like the easiest fix, but I would rather keep the information in an automatable fashion, so if it would be possible to set the Proxy name and number the javaagent option uses so I can more easily identify which config each file is generated by might also be useful. the only downside to this is I am not finding anything in the javaagent that would let me to this.p

I have a form similar to what you see in the fiddle below.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjLnbyd1q1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjLnbyd1q1ap  pWhen the form is generated initially, yii.validation via yiiActiveForm, works as expected.  However, the moment you add or delete another entry, it no longer functions the way its supposed to.  Ive tried to dive into yii.validation and yiiactiveForm to figure out why, but I have had no luck.p  pIt seems to be an event handler issue, but all the methods Ive tried do not work.  Further, it seems to be that any subsequent call after the initial yiiActiveForm call gets ignored.  The validation code will also not work unless its under document.ready.  p  pIm pretty new to coding and Ive been stuck on this particular issue for about a month now.  This is my last cry for help before I give up and just write my own clientside validation code. Part of the reason Im fighting with this is so that I can learn why it doesnt work the way I need it to and how to make it work.p  pOne other question, how can I execute the validation code multiple times  I tried to loop it varying only the ind variable, but that did not work.  Id rather loop it than write that block of code multiple times.  As it is written now, the validation will only fire for the first entry.p  pHere is the validation code blockp  precode     Yii validation code var ind  1 newthoughts.yiiActiveForm[         id thoughts  ind  thought,          name [  ind  ]thought,         container .fieldthoughts  ind  thought,         input thoughts  ind  thought,         validate function attribute, value, messages, deferred              yii.validation.requiredvalue, messages,                  message Thought cannot be blank.                          yii.validation.stringvalue, messages,                  message Thought must be a string.,                 min 1,                 tooShort Thought should contain at least 1 character.,                 max 10,                 tooLong Thought should contain at most 10 characters.,                 skipOnEmpty 1                       codepre  pIll try to find links to yii.validation.js and yiiactiveform.js on github and post them here.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comyiisoftyii2blobmasterframeworkassetsyii.validation.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comyiisoftyii2blobmasterframeworkassetsyii.validation.jsa a hrefhttpsgithub.comyiisoftyii2blobmasterframeworkassetsyii.activeForm.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comyiisoftyii2blobmasterframeworkassetsyii.activeForm.jsap

Negative 9287 pIm trying to implement a WCF Data Provider Service for a custom data store. I cannot assume any entity information properties, relationships, nada when writing this service because the data could be different. This means that all of the information needs to be derived at runtime.

Is there any way for the dataservice interface to ask for the pertinent information it needs, as it needs itp  pThanksp

I am doing this inside the event handler function. The way I tried to achieve this was the followingp  pStep 1 I have to find the relevant company document. The tag is a a href element inside a list element inside a containerdiv. Inside that div, I can find the name of the company, so I use that name to get the relevant document p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar companyName  event.target.parentElement.parentElement.children[1].textContent var company  Companies.findOnename companyName codepre  pThis works so far, but I imagine that theres a cleaner solution. I specially dont like the children[1] part. Any recommendationsp  pStep 2 Now that I have the company, I would like to increment the tag that was clicked. And that is kind of nasty because I need to select the right element of the array to update.

Negative 9287 pI cant figure out a way, how to make an external script in javascript for external usage, when i have my angularJS form with controller and other dependencies.p  pI made a local angularJS form, which uses angular material design Dialog service and i need to make an external script, which will open the same dialog, as it shows locally. Probably, i do not want external web apps to include angularJS and my whole app, i just need to open a Material Design dialog with my form and send information to my controller. Is it even possible p  pAlso, i found something similar that probably could help me, but i dont know if it really will help me, because i need to include all my dependencies into that template p  pI would love to hear all your ideas and advices about this task.p

Negative 9287 pI am trying to get my head around ASP MVC with using AJAX requests to the C controller, as it stands I am able to call my controller from my AJAX request.

Instead I receive codeundefinedcode.p  pNow, Im guessing that this has something to do with the way that I am returning a C dynamic.p  pHowever, I am presuming that I am returning the Object to AJAX incorrectly.p  pHow can I return the values so that they are an associative array in JavaScript Or even a method in which I can receive the data and convert it JavaScript side maybe...p  pThank you.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  precodealertJSON.stringifydata codepre  pReturnsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com14F2y.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 9287 pWe have 3 environments dev, test and prod. All 3 have different servers for web and sql. 6 servers We also have 1 AD FS server shared. MSDCRM 2015 OnPremise not hosted in cloud. We have AD with a different OU for each environment. We plan on integrating with crm apisdk to getset data from our accounting software and website.p  pThe thing I am trying to understand is how to name the organization properly. We want our URLs to be  example as orgnameorgap  ul licrm.company.comorgali licrmtest.company.comorgali licrmdev.company.comorgali ul  pAccording to our CRM Partner the organization must be unique to its environment. They were trying to suggest we use crmdev as our org name for example in dev, and in test our org would be crmtest and in prod crm but to me that is not best practice sounding and only the servername should be different in the 3 environments and the orgname would be the same in all 3. p  pCommon sense was telling me that an organization would be our companycorporation, and we might actually have other companies too... so lets say for example we had 3 orgs, one called orgA and another orgB. Then our urls would bep  ul licrm.company.comorgali licrm.company.comorgbli licrmtest.company.comorgali licrmtest.company.comorgbli licrmdev.company.comorgali licrmdev.company.comorgbli ul  pIn all my experience with multienvironments I would think that any differences beyond the subdomain or server name would be bad practice but our partner is saying that we have no choice and this IS the best practice that Microsoft Suggests too... they say that having the same org name in multiple environments breaks things. She also said that using our own DNS A Host records to change what URL people would use would also cause issues.p  pI spent hours searching the web for others asking this question but it seems Im the only one somehow. I would think it was a popular debate since it is the toplevl of your crm information and affects the URL.p

Negative 9287 pI was wondering how WhatsApp handles the time shown in every message.p  pFor those who dont knowp  ol liIf the message is very short, the text and time are in the same row.li liIf the message is long, the time is in the bottom right corner  the text wrapped around it.li ol  pWith a codeRelativeLayoutcode and codetoLeftOfcode I would get 1 but not 2 as previous lines would be cut off at the position of the time view. Same behaviour If i use a codeLinearLayoutcode.p  pSo I tried to use a codeFrameLayoutcode or a codeRelativeLayoutcode without any connection between text and time.p  pHowever, if the text is as long as the messageview is big, both views would overlap. If I put blank characters to my message I wouldnt have the time on the right.p  pDo they really have some kind of textwrappinglib for this or is it possible to do only with layoutsp  pHere is the requested screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMAL6b.png altenter image description herep

Negative 9287 pCertificates, provisioning profiles and setting Apple Push Notification is the part I could never grasp fully since first day. I believe a lot of people are having similar issues looking at SO questions. Unfortunately after long approval process and finally the app being in Appstore, my apps push notification is not working. While in development, the push notification was working perfectly. I guess I made a mistake in setting production certificates just before app store submission most probably the reason was my frustration with this subject  or my lack of knowledge  we will find out..p  pNow the technical part  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXguit.png altiOS App ID Settingsp  pI submitted my App with the APN certificate labelled as code1code. After we figured the PN are not working, I created the certificate labelled as code2code. I will talk about it later.p  pAnd here is the Keychain access screenshot from the computer I created the certificates from The labels are matched with the above certificates image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlN5U7.png altkeychain access screenshotp  pAs you can see, the certificate code1code doesnt have a private key attached to it. Is this a problem I dont know how it happened or if I have deleted it by mistake or never created it in the beginning. All the rest have private keys attached to the certificates.p  pThinking that this must be the reason for the PN not working, After the app was in Appstore, I created a new APN certificate labelled code2code. This time with a private key attachedp  pAnd here is how I export the certificate and private key couple to a .p12 file. I dont think this part is wrong since it is the same procedure I used for development .p12p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1xhwG.png alt.p12 exportingp  pWhatever I tried, I exported every possible .p12 combination of the 4 certificates and 3 private keys and embedded them to our server Push notifications are not working.p  pSo my question isp  pDo I have to resubmit my app to the Appstore again with brand new certificates This would be really bad since the people who downloaded the app will not have Push notification functionality for another at least 12 days. thats how long it took Appstore to review last timep  pIs there still a chance that I can play with the Apple Developer Console and altercreate new certificatesprovisioning filesAPN certificates and get this thing working without the need for a resubmission.p  pThanks for reading the somehow long question.

Negative 9287 pI need to add a dropdown menu to Wordpress in the admin bar to include multiple links. What is the best solutionp
Negative 9287 pIm having a strange issue with fitBounds not working after an ajax call. On the initial page load, fitBounds works fine, and it centers 5 markers. However, after I click on one of the dropdown filters or the pagination which triggers an ajax function to update the markers, it doesnt want to load, even though it appears to be trying to center the map based on where the markers should be. The filters are definitely working because I am also outputting a list of all maker locations beside the map.p  pI have also noticed, that if I adjust my query to only show 1 marker at a time, fitBounds tends to work better, although not all the time. It seems as though something in the for loop may be throwing something off. But I still dont have 100 success rate with only showing 1 marker. I just seems to work a bit better for the most part.p  pRegardless of how many markers I output with the ajax function, eventually, after clicking on the filters multiple times, its like the map lags out. Sometimes it will show a marker, but the map behind it wont be right. And sometimes that map will start to get more and more distorted each time each time the filters are triggered. Another strange thing is that once I trigger the ajax function for new marker, if I hover over the zoom bar on the map, it automatically slides all the way to the bottom and cant be moved. And if I try to move the map by clicking and dragging, the whole thing turns solid gray.p  pBelow is the first function that loads the markers once the page loads. It works fine and so does fitBounds at this point.p  precodevar mapCanvas  document.getElementByIdmapcanvas         var mapOptions             center new google.maps.LatLng30, 209.6,           zoom 3,           maxZoom 4,           mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP                    create the map         var map  new google.maps.MapmapCanvas, mapOptions           array to hold the markers         var markers  []            Create a new viewpoint bound         var bounds  new google.maps.LatLngBounds            Loop through array and add markers to map         for i  0 i lt jqueryarray.length i                var position  new google.maps.LatLngjqueryarray[i][lat], jqueryarray[i][long]             var marker  new google.maps.Marker                 position position,                 map map,                 icon mapIcon,  just assume this has been set                 title jqueryarray[i][title]                             increase bounds and fit to map             bounds.extend position             map.fitBounds bounds              markers.pushmarker           end of the for loop codepre  pAnd here is the other function that is called by ajax once the dropdown menu filters are trigged. Again, it seems to have trouble if more than one marker needs to be added to the map. The functions works perfectly without using fitBounds, though, so there is definitely an issue with the way I am using fitBounds.p  precode this function adds new map markers after a select menu change         function addNewMarkersjson, count              for var i  0 i lt count i                   markers[i].setMapnull                            reset the markers array             markers  []                Create a new viewpoint bound. Do I need this again             var bounds  new google.maps.LatLngBounds              bounds  new google.maps.LatLngBoundsnull               Loop through our array and add markers to map               for i  0 i lt json.length i                    var myPosition  new google.maps.LatLngjson[i].lat, json[i].long                 var marker  new google.maps.Marker                     position myPosition,                     map map,                     icon mapIcon,   assume this has been set                     title json[i].title                                     increase bounds and fit to map                 bounds.extend myPosition                 map.fitBounds bounds                  markers.pushmarker               end of for loop           end of addNewMarkers function codepre

Negative 9287 pI use some framework which sometimes executes new processes.

Negative 9287 pFirst a bit of background I KNOW that MS Office interop is not supported in a server environment.  I was told to make it work anyway.p  pI have inherited a project from a developer who has left the company.  The project involves converting arbitrary 12 page documents uploaded to our website by users to PDF format.  The documents are a variety of primarily Office documents.  Off the top of my head we accept doc, docx, txt, and rtf documents and possibly others.  The documents must be made available at a later date both in the original format and PDF format.  The developer decided that the best way to accomplish this was by using MS Office interop and letting Word handle the conversion.p  pOn his workstation and on mine it works pretty well, but as soon as the site is published to a server it fails.  It doesnt just fail though, Word opens up and consumes more and more and more memory until it finally locks up the server and the server must be powercycled.p  pI have been beating my head over this for a while now.  Most of the other people online I have found having trouble have reported an error message, but I have not found anyone reporting that the server simply locks up.  And yet, I have observed exactly the same behavior on three different servers.  I tried wrapping the code in a windows service as opposed to an aspx page in IIS and observed the same behavior.  I wrapped the code in a winforms application and it worked just fine.  The essentials can be found belowp  precode    Dim wordApplication As Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ApplicationClass  New ApplicationClass     Dim wordDocument As Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document  Nothing     Try         wordDocument  wordApplication.Documents.OpenCTypefileUrl, Object, False, True          If wordDocument IsNot Nothing Then             wordDocument.ExportAsFixedFormatpdfUrl, WdExportFormat.wdExportFormatPDF         End If     Finally         If wordDocument IsNot Nothing Then             wordDocument.CloseFalse             wordDocument  Nothing         End If          If wordApplication IsNot Nothing Then             wordApplication.Quit             wordApplication  Nothing         End If          GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers         GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers     End Try codepre  pHas anyone else dealt with an issue like thisp

Negative 9287 pI have two tables. One of those tables has this schemap  precodeCREATE TABLE objectmaster70974   id int10 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,  idobject int10 unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  idmaster int10 unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  idslave int10 unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  idfield bigint20 unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  idslavefield bigint20 unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  PRIMARY KEY id,  UNIQUE KEY idobject    idobject,idmaster,idslave,idfield,idslavefield,  KEY idobject2 idobject,idmaster,idfield,idslavefield,  KEY idobject3 idobject,idslave,idfield,  KEY idobject4 idobject,idslavefield,  KEY idobject5 idobject,idmaster,idslave,idfield,  KEY idobject6 idobject,idmaster,idslave,idslavefield,  KEY idmaster idmaster,idslavefield,  KEY idobject7 idobject,idfield  ENGINEInnoDB AUTOINCREMENT17827 DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pAs you can see, there is an overlapping index codeKEY idobject5 idobject,idmaster,idslave,idfieldcode and there is no index that would cover these three fields codeidobjectcode, codeidmastercode, codeidfieldcode. However, when I run these two queriesp  precodeSELECT f1.id  FROM object70974 f1   LEFT JOIN objectmaster70974 mss0 ON mss0.idobject IN 70974,71759   AND mss0.idmaster  71100 AND mss0.idslave  70912 AND mss0.idfield  f1.id codepre  pand p  precodeSELECT f1.id  FROM object70974 f1   LEFT JOIN objectmaster70974 mss0 ON mss0.idobject IN 70974,71759   AND mss0.idmaster  71100 AND mss0.idfield  f1.id codepre  pthey both return the same number of rows since in fact codeidslavecode field does not really matter  code3530code, however, the first query is slower than the second query by one second  8 and 7 seconds respectively. So, I guess I have to ask two questions  1 why does the second query run faster, even though it does not use index and 2 why does the first query run so slowly and why does not it use an index obviously. In short, what the heck is going onp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThis is the result of codeEXPLAINcode command identical for both queriesp  precodeid    selecttype   table type  possiblekeys key   keylen   ref   rows  Extra 1 SIMPLE    f1    index N  attr80420   5 N  3340  Using index 1 SIMPLE    mss0  ref   idobject,idobject2,idobject3,idobject4,idobject5,idobject6,idmaster,idobject7   idmaster 4 const 3529  Using where codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIts extremely interesting, because if I codeDROPcode codeidmastercode index which for some strange reason is used by both queries, then it starts to use codeidobject5code index.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAnd, yes, with codeidmastercode index being dropped, both queries start to run superfast. So, I guess there is some trouble with optimizer.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI even have a guess what trouble faces the optimizer  it may be incorrectly treats codeidslavefieldcode field name in the key, as if it were two fields instead  codeidslavecode and codeidfieldcode.

Negative 9287 pIn Scala a future can fail and this can be found out asynchronouslyp  precodef onComplete    case Success gt printlnGreat   case Failuret gt printlnAn error has occurred   t.getMessage  codepre  pHow would you translate this into Clojure My reading leads me to believe that the Clojure futurepromise model is not as powerful as Scalas, and you cant just catch the failure like this. So what to do instead p  pA Scala future never needs to be asked for its value  when it is good and ready it will tell you what happened including whether it failed  thats the crux of this question. This is what I meant by asynchronously. A Scala future can be in one of three possible states  uncompleted, completed with failure, completed with success.p  pA typical example of a use case in Scala is a remote call that returns a Future[T], where T is the type of what you really want to get back. If the remote JVM is down then after a timeout the codecase Failuretcode will happen.p  pThis is quite a straightforward model to work with. In the question I was asking for a simple alternative. As a sidecomment it would be good to hear that Clojure intends to adopt the Scala Futures model at some point.p

Negative 9287 pWell, I have a RecyclerView with an adapter and everything works great. The items in the ArrayList dataset are being updated periodically. So the items and their elements as well as their position in the list change. This is achieved by simple sorting and manually calling these methods, whenever things happenp  precode swapping two items Collections.swapitems, i, j itemsAdapter.notifyItemMovedi, j   adding a new one itemAdapter.notifyItemInserteditems.size   when updating valus itemAdapter.notifyItemChangedi codepre  pThe latter of which, is the cause of my misery. Every time an item is updated, a little blink animation is triggered. p  pI found a couple of solutions for thisp  precode disabling all animations recyclerView.getItemAnimator.setSupportsChangeAnimationsfalse   or   setting the animation duration to zero, recyclerView.getItemAnimator.setChangeDuration0 codepre  pBut both of these kill the animations when items move being swapped. I just want to override the one animation and keep all of this magic. Is there a way of doing this And if its overriding ItemAnimator, does anyone have a simple examplep  pThanks in advancep
Negative 9287 pI havent been able to find an answer to this important question on the internet, and before I dive into the interpreters source code I thought Id ask herep  pIve read of Lua tables having an emarray partem and a emhash partem, and I assume that this translates directly into two separate data structures for each table. But Im wondering exactly how Lua handles something likep  precodea  1, 2, 3, 4, key  value a[6]  6 a[500]  500 codepre  pI guess its clear that codekey  valuecode will be put into the emhash partem, and indices 1 through 4 will go in the emarray partem, but what rule governs how an item at index 6 is stored leaving a gap at index 5 and similarly at index 500p  pAnd does something magic happen if I form new contiguous ranges, for instance withp  precodefor i  100, 1, 1 do     x[i]  i end codepre  pwill Lua ever realise that it has a single array with indices from 1 through 100, or will all those elements forever be in the emhash partemp

Negative 9287 pIn objectivec I used to implement my idle timer by basing it on the following CoreGraphics callp  precodeCGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventTypekCGEventSourceStateCombinedSessionState, kCGAnyInputEventType codepre  pNow in swift, using the same basic call, Itd look likep  precodeCGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventTypeCGEventSourceStateID.CombinedSessionState, CGEventType.MouseMoved codepre  pAfter examining the header files, where for instance strongCGEventTypestrong is defined, I could not find a mention to any constant that does anything in the form of which I was able to do in the ObjC implementation.p  pNow I could probably workaround this by looking up the value of the constant and going about it like that, but Id strongly prefer not to. Id rather rewrite using strongIOKitstrong instead then. strongIt looks like it basically is defined as 0strong, but like mentioned earlier, I rather not hardcode it like that.p

Negative 9287 pSo Im using the library iOSCharts for creating a calendar. The calendar shows plots of each day for each month. So for 1 year I have 12 codeUIViewscode plotted with data from each corresponding month.

However, the codeUIViewcode does not get completely filled with the codeLineChartcode.p  pSo for February it looks like 3 points are missing, since the plot is not stretching the entire codeUIViewcode.

I have my environment set to smooth so much of the shape is approximated by Open TK upon drawing.  p  pCorrect me if I am wrong but I would think that the view window can be thought of as a rectangular cylinder slicing through the object, and the point on the view window can simply follow that same angle into the partp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comm3yJc.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comm3yJc.png altenter image description hereap  pIf this is correct, then it should be relatively easy to establish the ray but my question still exists of how to tell where this ray intersects my part I am trying to get an actual x,y,z coordinate of where this intersection happens.  I will eventually use this as a method to set the cameras focus to the point clicked on so that things such as rotation happen with that new point as the focus.p  pAny help would be appreciated and any solution can be in either VB .NET or C.p  pThanksp

Negative 9287 pI have an issue with a single at least for now iPhone not being able to connect to websockets. Unfortunately I dont have access to the device and I cant run more tests on it at the moment, so no proper network dumps or anything else deeper level debugging available. Cant test on other network connections either at the moment.p  pEverything works perfectly with Chrome 45, Firefox 40, Chrome 45 on Android many devices, Safari on iOS9 device A, Safari on iOS8 device B etc. No errors, no cutoffs, nothing. Just works.p  pMy websocket server runs on IIS 8.5  ASP.NET, created as an API controller with the typical way PullHandler is an async Task codewhilecodeing until connection closesp  precodeif HttpContext.Current.IsWebSocketRequest      HttpContext.Current.AcceptWebSocketRequestPullHandler     return Request.CreateResponseHttpStatusCode.SwitchingProtocols  else     return Request.CreateErrorResponseHttpStatusCode.BadRequest, Bad request codepre  pThis should not cause any issues, especially this one.

I am also using SignalR which automatically goes into emlongPollingem transport on this device. With others its nicely on emwebSocketsem transport.p  pQuick testing on UK Orange 3G connection showed on my HTTP logs that for some reason the request for my endpoint has gone to the else branch, like something had stripped the upgrade headers away.p  blockquote   pGET apiSomeEndpoint 80  Mozilla5.0iPhoneCPUiPhoneOS90likeMacOSXAppleWebKit601.1.46KHTML,likeGeckoVersion9.0Mobile13A344Safari601.1  400p blockquote  pStatus 400 is clearly showing the bad request that my code is sending if the request is not a proper websocket request. I dont know if there could be some transparent proxy, that could explain this. The 400 response was received without any delays.p  pBut this was a problem also through wifi on the same device. Again, a laptop with OS X and Safari had no issues on the same wifi to connect to SignalR and my websocket server. Only the iPhone had issues. On wifi I didnt get any attempts to connect on the logs and SignalR also immediately went into longPolling transport. The wifi apparently used Virgin Medias network based on IP address.p  pOn wifi there is first an open event. Then after some time there is a close event with status 1006, which is abnormal termination without a close packet. My code tries to connect again and the same happens. Strangely there is no log entry at the web server, but it might just be Safaris way to post the open event even though an actual connection was not established and after a timeout it sends the close event.p  pThe device should not have any proxies set up and other browsing works without issues. Unfortunately I couldnt get any information about any other site that would use websockets working or not on that device.p  pHas anyone run into this kind of situation I do understand that the 3G might just be a misbehaving proxy, but the wifi issue cannot be explained with that.p

Ive tried looking it up on both the pfSense Guide as well as the forums, but since I cant find a related situation to mine, I hereby ask you guys for some help.p  pWhat it looks like now with example WAN IPsp  pWAN1 000.000.000.58 with internal IP addresses on LAN1 192.168.1.1  192.168.1.245 WAN2 000.000.000.61 with internal IP addresses on LAN2 192.168.2.1  192.168.2.245 WAN3 000.000.000.59 with internal IP addresses on LAN3 192.168.3.1  192.168.3.245p  pThe way I have it set up now is as followsp  pFirst I configured all the interfaces, whereas I now have 3 WAN interfaces with Static IPv4 addresses configured. Example WAN1 interace has a static IP of 000.000.000.59 and an IPv4 Upstream Gateway 000.000.000.57 which would be the broadcast address for all WANs.p  pThe problems start right here, because I cant add this address to anymore interfaces, because it already exists, but isnt selectable from the dropdown menu. This is one of the reasons why we want one WAN interface to handle all three of our WAN addresses with one uplink address.p  pSo the question in short is there a way to have one uplinkupstream address for all WANs. And if so, is there also a way to have just one WAN interface and three LAN interfaces in the following wayp  pWAN interface must have an uplinkupstream gateway of 000.000.000.57 for the following WAN addresses 000.000.000.58, 000.000.000.59 and 000.000.000.61 whereasp  pWAN1 000.000.000.58  for LAN1 interface w internal range of 192.168.1.1  192.168.1.245 WAN2 000.000.000.61  for LAN2 interface w internal range of 192.168.2.1  192.168.2.245 WAN3 000.000.000.59  for LAN3 interface w internal range of 192.168.3.1  192.168.3.245p  pWAN interface is not going to get a DHCP function, because it needs to be all three of the WAN addresses. The LAN interfaces are going to get the DHCP function for the ranges listed above.p  pIn other words p  ul liall traffic from the 192.168.1.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.58 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li liall traffic from the 192.168.2.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.61 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li liall traffic from the 192.168.3.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.59 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li ul  pCan this be done, yes or nop  pIf you need any more information, feel free to ask and Ill happily elaborate.p  pThank you very much in advancep  pGrtz,p  pJeffp
