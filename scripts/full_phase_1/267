Positive 267 pSince iOS 9, Im having strange keyboard issues. My code remains the same but sometimes my keyboard isnt responding to touch for the MFMessageComposeViewController or for inApp purchases when youre entering your AppleID and password. The keyboard is being presented and doesnt respond to touch but everything else on the screen does. This is on my device, not on the simulator, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8070666storekitsupportinios5simulatorkeyboarddoesntworkthisa question addresses. p  pDoes anyone know how to fix this or has experienced this p  pI change the date on my phone a lot for testing, which I know messes up my ability to have iMessages, and I notice that the keyboard issues often happen then so I think there might be some connection.p

Positive 267 pI need to emulate keyboard typing in python where the python program runs outside a virtual environment and the typing happens inside the virtual environment. The below python program is running on the computer host and the typing is happening within a notepad window VirtualBox. This is necessary to avoid detection from the virtual computer that the typing is done from a python program.p  pThe below code works well under normal circumstances i.e. when the window that I emulate the typing in, is within the same environment as the python program, however when I use it to enter a text in a window that is within VirtualBox the result is completely random and for example Hi becomes q89 or Hirn suddenly becomes q89. When I run both the program and the notepad window where I have it typing within virtualBox then everything works as expected as well. Its just a problem when the python program runs on the host and the notepad window is within virtualBox.

Positive 267 pWe would like to do as below linkshot, please let us know how to do. On the android device or smart phone, when virtual keyboard would be launched as above and these device get to be connected with USB keyboard, when we are trying to text, cursor would be moved by direction key with using cursor ex. red box mark as above, putting enter key would be taken as selection.   p  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comscaoggbsi1usxj7vScreenshot.pngdl0ampssl relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comscaoggbsi1usxj7vScreenshot.pngdl0ampsslap
Positive 267 pI have a strange visual bug that only affects iOS 9 devicesp  pMy apps login codeUIViewControllercode runs off and gets an OAuth token when you hit the button, much like youd expect. If the response from my API returns a specific status code, I pop up a codeUIAlertViewcode saying they need to reset their password this is if theyve been flagged as such on the server end. The email and password fields for login coderesignFirstRespondercode once you hit the button, standard stuff.p  pOn iOS 9 only, if you hit the reset path, the second you tap OK on that alert view, the keyboard pops back up, for maybe 800ms, then dismisses again. Its almost as if something was queued to present it, but the presence of the alert blocked it until you hit OK  its absolutely instantaneous after hitting okay on the alert.p  pIt seems a really tricky one to debug. Ive added symbolic breakpoints to codebecomeFirstRespondercode and it isnt called anywhere near this process occurring.p  pAny other ideas for how I can look at debugging  fixing this It doesnt affect iOS 7 and iOS 8, only iOS 9.p
Positive 267 pGood morningevening everyone. I am trying to make it so when the keyboard shows up, the text field and the entire view moves up.

But the FIRST time and only the FIRST time it is called, the view resets to the default value, not the new value. p  pThen, the second, third, etc. times, it works perfectly.

Positive 267 pI am developing an android application in which my mainActivity has 5 tabs at the bottom represented in FrameLayout. Each tab points to a particular fragment which gets loaded based on the tab clicked. p  pIn my 1st tab, Ive an EditText. When the edit text is focused, I need to show the keyboard by just moving the layout of EditText and Send button up without pushing up the other components including the bottom tab frame layout. Similarly when hiding the keyboard, the EditText and Send btn layout should sit just above the tab frame layout. Can someone please suggest me the solution for thisp  pAssume the situation same as in Facebook comment. When we go inside a post to comment something, the layout Write Comment ET and POST btn will be pushed up without moving any other components including the bottom tabs News Feed, Requests, Messenger, Notifications, Morep  pI dont want to make the frame layout Visibility.GoneVisible as it ends up in an ugly animation when the keyboard slides updown.p

Positive 267 pRight now I have a PySide application that reads input from devices that act like keyboards. My problem is that when the input is too fast PySide skips repetitive characters. For example if I send the text 12223 in keystrokes the application receives only 123. This behavior is limited to repetitive characters as far as I can see. My application currently is running on Linux and to simulate the fast input I used the command  xte str 12223  What could I do to avoid this behavior, is there some parameter that could stop this filtration of events that PySide is doingp  pThanks.p

Negative 267 pIm beginning my foray into fulltext search for MSSQL2005. This is a new, indev database, so I can monkey around with it.p  pLets say I have a Form table that has a onetomany relationship to two other tables, Answer and Comment. I want the user to be able to enter one search term and have it peg all three of those tables via fulltext search. Whats the best way It appears as though I can create an a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comtechnetprodtechnolsql2005impprfiv.mspx relnofollowindexed viewa to speed things along.p  pIf I do use an indexed view is this the best route anyway, how do I handle the onetomany relationships Lets assume all I really want to figure out is the ID of the Form table that would contain any search results found in the child AnswerComment tables, so I can show the entire form that contains the located entries. An inner join on the view would result in multiple master form rows being returned  doesnt sound great for performance. How about concatenating all child answercomment rows into one column for the view So instead of....p  precodeForm 1, Answer A, Comment A  Form 1, Answer B, Comment A  Form 1, Answer A, Comment B  Form 1, Answer B, Comment B codepre  p...itd be...p  precodeForm 1, Answer A Answer B, Comment A Comment B codepre  pRemember all I care about is the ID of that master form row.p  pThis seems logical to me, but Im not sure the best practices around fulltext search yet, so just curious if Im approaching it correctly.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Looks like indexed views are pretty strict no left joins, no subqueries, so I might go down the path of a summary table populated by triggers if it isnt going to be too unwieldy.p

Im working around these requirementsp  ol liIm building a public website where I need to display video.li liI need to control what the player looks likeli liIm the sole publisher of the video, meaning it cant be on YouTube for exampleli liI need as much protection as possible in terms of protecting the content from being downloadedli ol  pSo, Ive read around StackOverflow and the web, and found lots of suggestions, like numerous flash players, Streaming servers, DRM protocols, services like Panda etc etc.p  pThe problem is I dont understand how everything fits together.p  pFor example, what makes my video content secure Is it the player on the client is it the server that hosts the content is it the streaming process who hosts the streaming servers and what difference does this makep  pBearing in mind this is otherwise a very simple site, and is not a business venture. p  pif you were working around my requirements, what would you do Could you explain step by step at a high levelp  phr p  pstrongEDITstrong Just based on a couple of answers, Im not saying no one can ever download my content. And I realize this kind of thing is expensive.p  pIm just asking, if you had my requirements, what would you do And could you explain it to me so i understandp  pthanks againp  pstrongEditstrong Thanks again for all the feedback, I cant vote anyone up as Im a new user, but your answers have been very helpful.p  pThe one thing I will say, is that my only request was to attempt security, that is make it difficult for most users...that is common in software security.p  pSome of the suggestions have been just to not even try.p  pMy question was really based around the fact that I know nothing about video deployment on the web, apart form the basic embedded swf flv combo.p  pAnyway, your info has been very useful though. Ill try a simple real streaming service as opposed to HTTP streaming.p  pAny other recommendations would be awesomep  pcheersp
Negative 267 pIm developing a web page in Asp.Net 1.1 and have a DataGrid which allows users to add, edit, and delete database records.

Negative 267 pI am looking to start a new project and I am trying to decide which framework to go with. I have been using ASP.Net for a while and enjoy it. My first introduction to web applications was with PHP and I still love it. The project should be a medium sized project maintained by 1 or 2 developers with a potential to grow. The only pros and cons are can think of are as followsp  pASP.Net MVC Prosp  ul liBig community support and increasingli liSeems to be fully featuredli ul  pConsp  ul liGetting a dedicated server will be expensive.li liA licensed version of SQL Server will be expensiveli ul  pZend Framework Prosp  ul liAlso a fairly large communityli liFree, using the typical LAMP setupli ul  pConsp  ul liNot as mainstreamli liMight contain possible limitationsli ul  pLastly, I have enjoyed working with ASP.Nets concept of Master pages. Does ASP.Net MVC still support this and does Zend Framework have something similar. I think that Zend offers something called templating and it looks close to Master pages.p  pWhat is your opinionp

Negative 267 pHow do I detect in my program that its being run under a debugger  I am aware that this seems to indicate that I try to do something I shouldnt, and that is too messy.  I think it is an interesting question tho.  Specifically, is there a way to do it in a POSIX environment  For example using sigaction 2 to detect that some handler is installed  Even a worse thought is there some inline assembly code I could use on an x86 architecturep  pAs we discuss it  would it eventually be possible to launch a debugger, such as gdb 1, and break at the place where you perform this possible hack.  Thanks for any dirty oneliners or unlikely references to standards related to this.p

Negative 267 pThis working code seems to be the typical solution to this problem.p  pIt takes a multidimensional array that holds categories and their subcategories with no implied limitation on how many levels deep it goes and creates an HTML unordered list from it, echoing it out onto the page from inside a recursive function.p  pSublevels are traversed by passing the value for each array elements children key to  arraywalk recursively, from inside the original callback function named categorylist.p  pHow can this method of output be modified so that all HTML code would exist in the template, outside the functionp  h3Heres the rundown of the codeh3  pThis multidimensional array holds the multilevel category tree.p  pImportant keys to use in the HTML are categoryid, name, and children. Other keys have been purged from the array below for simplicity sake, but if they are useful they are parentid and level starting with level 1.p  precodeltphp   the array containing the tree categories  array    categoryid gt 2,   name gt Top Category Name,   children gt array      0 gt array        categoryid gt 188,       name gt Category Name,       children gt array          0 gt array            categoryid gt 159,           name gt Category Name,           children gt array ,         ,         1 gt array            categoryid gt 160,           name gt Category Name,           children gt array ,         ,         2 gt array            categoryid gt 166,           name gt Category Name,           children gt array ,         ,       ,     ,     1 gt array        categoryid gt 4,       name gt Category Name,       children gt array          0 gt array            categoryid gt 141,           name gt Category Name,           children gt array ,         ,         1 gt array            categoryid gt 142,           name gt Category Name,           children gt array ,         ,       ,     ,   ,   gt codepre  p.p  pThis next function produces the majority of the HTML output, but it locks the HTML inside itself.p  pHowever, instead of echoing it right from the function, Im looking for a way to pass this data back to the view template in a manner that is friendly for designers to customize.p  precodeltphp   separate the HTML from this function,  passing v to the view template for handling function categorylistv, k   switch k      case categoryid       echo ltli idvgt       break     case name       echo v       break     case children       ifcountv gt 0         echo ltulgt         foreachv as kgtv         arraywalkv, categorylist         echo ltulgt              echo ltligt       break      gt codepre  p.p  pThe next block of code is the current template htmlphp with the call to traverse the first level of the array via arraywalk and referencing the recursive function above. The function itself then handles the recursion and iteration of deeper categories with 1 or more child. Of course, this is the typical approach.p  pThis code should have all HTML tags, rather than just the outer  tags.p  precodeltulgt ltphp arraywalktree,categorylist gt ltulgt codepre  p.p  pThe Ideal Solutionp  pThe end goal here is to find a way for template designers to create their ideal navigation structure without having to create or modify the recursion function which isnt accessible, nor require use of a foreach loop for each level of the multidimensional array. The solution should not be tied to any specific depth limitations.p  pExamples of HTML customizations could range from placing additional attributes inside the ulli tags, or even wrapping new tags around the output text, such as span tags, which are commonly used in navigations to achieve a slidingdoors effect with CSS. So I think the appropriate solution will need to support those case scenarios at a minimum.p  pIterating through the array from the template using arraywalk would still be okay, as long as it can be used in such a way that the callback function passes the desired vars back to the template for use with the designers HTML.p  pIdeally, if arraywalkrecursive knew how many levels deep its iterator actually is, I think this feat would be much easier to solve. But unless someone knows a workaround to that issue, the solution may be different entirely.p  pI also want to avoid using javascript methods of building the tree. And if theres a way to avoid using the switch, Im open to suggestions there too.p

Negative 267 pI have been thinking how to display the validation messages into different sections of the form. I have an online quotation with single html form. I have put them into different section to ease the user enter the information based on the categories.p  pI have divided the form for example into the Customer Contact Details, Consultants Details, Customer Credit Card Details, Air Ticket Sections. Please note that the actual form is not as simple as this one. I want to do a jQuery validation on this form. The problem is I want to separate the validation messages base on its category. I do not want mix the validation messages into one. This will confuse the consultants, as this form is a fully dynamic form, and it can be consist for more than 100 fields for just only single quotation.p  pSo, for Customer Contact Details, the validation messages will only notify the user anything that is associated with the Customer Contact Details.  Anything that is not valid, the message will be displayed next to the associated field. Same thing for Consultant Details and Customer Credit Card Details.p  pHowever, it is different with Air Ticket Sections, where bunch of information are placed in a table. With the table format, the validation messages cannot be displayed next to the field. So, I am thinking to use jQuery errorLableContainer to display the messages.p  pAt this point of time, I only can think to use different html form. However, I do not want to do this. I want to keep it with single html form. Or, I can use jQuery groups, where I havent done the testing to use jQuery groups.p  pAnyone has any better idea to solve this validation messages Any thought would be appreciated. I am sure, someone out there are also having the same issues.p  pThank you.p

Negative 267 pOK, so heres what Im trying to dop  pI have a landing page with 3 buttons on it, and I have 3 corresponding external swf files, one for each button... so the user clicks a button and the corresponding swf file is loaded into an empty MC on the stage. Now each of these external swf files also contains several buttons and each of these buttons when clicked will fire off a click event, each buttons event in each swf is uniquely named based on the button name and the swf file name ex swf1button1click So in the main swf file after a button is clicked I loop through the 3 main buttons and add listeners to the contents of the empty holder clip for each of the buttons so its listening for swf1button1click, swf1button2click, swf2button1click... so on and so forth. p  pNow this all works, clips load in correctly, events fire and are heard approperatly meaning the empty clip does recieve the swf1btn1click event and it fires the code associated with that event correctly, but the problem is with the function being called, Here is the code in question...p  pThe function for loading the external swf filesp  precodefunction loadCommunityeMouseEvent   var mLoaderLoader  new Loader  var communityString  MovieClipe.currentTarget.name  traceLoading   community  var mRequestURLRequest  new URLRequestDevSiteflash  community  .swfcommunity  community  mLoader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, displayCommunity  mLoader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListenerProgressEvent.PROGRESS, functioneProgressEvent    var percentNumber  e.bytesLoaded  e.bytesTotal   percent  Math.roundpercent  100   tracepercent   loaded    mLoader.loadmRequest  codepre  pThe code for assigning the event listenersp  precodefunction displayCommunityeEvent   for var i  0 i lt mcCommunityHolder.numChildren i    mcCommunityHolder.removeChildmcCommunityHolder.getChildAti    mcCommunityHolder.alpha  0  mcCommunityHolder.visible  true  mcCommunityHolder.addChilde.currentTarget.content  TweenLite.tomcCommunityHolder, 1, alpha1, easingElastic.easeOut  var newClipMovieClip  MovieClipmcCommunityHolder.getChildAtmcCommunityHolder.numChildren  1   for each var mcMovieClip in mcCommunities    var commNameString  mc.name.toLowerCase   trace ...   commName   ...    newClip.addEventListenercommName  btnMap, functioneEvent  traceclicked   commName viewLotmapcommName    newClip.addEventListenercommName  btnLocation, functioneEvent  traceclicked   commName viewLocationmapcommName    newClip.addEventListenercommName  btnAriel, functioneEvent  traceclicked   commName arielPhotoscommName    newClip.addEventListenercommName  btnRegister, functioneEvent  traceclicked   commName communityRegistercommName     codepre  pSo what Im getting is no matter what external swfs button I have clicked the events of the buttons within it act as though I where clicking a button from within external swf 3... make sensep  pheres an example I click Button1, external swf 1 loads and displays, within external swf 1 I click button 1 which fires off its event swf1btn1click and the main swf sees it as such, but when this function communityRegistercommName is called within the listener event, commName is always the same value the value that btn3 of the main swf should have. p  pSo my main flash piece is treating every external swfs events as though they where coming from external swf 3. The best way I can explain it is Its treating commNameString as if it where a reference variable and when I resign it on every iteration of the loop, the previous uses of it also change to the new value so every time Ive used it is always set to the value of the last time it where assigned...p  pGahh, what a brain wreck, haha... Ive had this issue many times before and never actually figured it out. Ive always just managed to re work the code until it fixed its self, but Im tire of doing that and I want to know why this happens. Im not interested in other ways of coding what I want to do, I need to know what is going on to cause this sort of behaviour so dont be shy about getting technical p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 267 pI need some clever and rather simple solution to my problem  province shape generation. Suppose that map is matrix NxM.

There are also few simple rulesp  ul lithere is max size of province and min size of province for example min  2, max  10li liall tiles of province should be connected by vertical or horizontal, but not cornersli ul  pExample of invalid province its not connectedp  precode1100 0000 0011 0000 codepre  ul lithere should not be enclaves province inside provinceli lishapes should be randomli ul  pI was trying to implement it by flood fill modification but it has some disadvantages.

Negative 267 pIve come across this issue a few times and would like find out if there is a simple method or pattern I can use to solve it.p  pImagine a tree structure where each node contains a STL container vector of pointers to children.  I want client code to be able to traverse this tree, and iterate through the child containers to access other parts.p  pMy problem is that I want to maintain encapsulation for my nodes while at the same time letting clients easily see all of the children for that node. I also want to make sure that if a client gets a const reference to the root node in the tree, then all access to subsequent parts of the tree are also const.p  pShould I try to make an iterator class for my node type, have a node method return vector iterators , or is there a more elegant pattern Im missingp  pstrongEditstrong I want to stress again that while I see some good ideas presented, I have containers of strongempointersemstrong to other nodes.  Returning a codevectorltnode gtconstiteratorcode will not prevent clients from calling nonconst methods on the node.  It only protects the pointers themselves from pointing at different objects.p

Negative 267 pI have a .NET application that uses MS Access as a database. I have been using the AnyCPU as the compile target. This has been running well on Windows XP 32bit.

Negative 267 pThe first question on this board and already a pretty long one  im sorry for that and hereby thank you all for the great tips i got from this platform.p  pIm trying to hook several functions its more or less plugin code, so the function I want to hook is not writtencan not be changed by me, but can be directly accessed in the same processthread with Microsoft Detours.p  pEvery function which shall be hooked is generated by a cstyle compiler and always has the following assembler startup codep  precode045A1A85  push        ebp   045A1A86  push        ebx   045A1A87  push        esi   045A1A88  push        edi   045A1A89  call        045A1A8E   045A1A8E  pop         eax   045A1A8F  mov         ebx,eax   go on with a little bit more assembler code codepre  pAs you can see some registers are pushed to the stack, and then the call instruction is invoked to the next line please do not ask to change this, as already said i do not have access to this generated code. The call instruction changes the stack  this stack change is saved in the eax register and used for further processingp  pThis method will be hooked top  precode045A1A85  jmp         hookingfunction 528040h   045A1A8A  int         3   045A1A8B  int         3   045A1A8C  int         3   045A1A8D  int         3   045A1A8E  pop         eax   codepre  pThe hooking function is defined as a naked function which just jumps to the trampoline function.p  precodeinline declspecnaked void hookingfunction      more code in future     asm          jmp orgfunctrampoline       codepre  pWith the following trampoline functionp  precode031F0060  push        ebp   031F0061  push        ebx   031F0062  push        esi   031F0063  push        edi   031F0064  call        045A1A8E   031F0069  jmp         045A1A8E   codepre  pThe main problem is, that the call instruction in the trampoline assembler code 1 adds a wrong value to the stack in this case to 031f0064 instead of 045A1A89  further processing with eax will receive wrong results 2 destroys more or less the stack frame, as the next ret will jump back to 031F0069  same processing will be done twice ret will be called AGAIN, leads to wrong function..p  pPlease understand, that it is NOT guaranteed that every function i want to hook begins with the above stated preamble.. therefore i can not rewrite the hooking function, and ignore the trampoline method...p  pSo the basic question after all this text Is it possible to hook a function with Microsoft Detour, where in the first 5 Byte of the function a call instruction is invoked if not, are there any alternativesp  pThank you very much for reading and hopefully for your helpp

Negative 267 pWell, past few days I am trying to put plans for my chess server project on the table. It is planned to be made of several web services which interact mutualy.

All clients requests will be done through this service and forwarded respectively.p  pAll players moves must go through web services because of move validation, history and so on. Problem occurs when other player needs to be informed of opponents played move. Persistant client request to discover is opponent played move towards service is out of question because player turn change must be immidiate when opponent play his move. How to achive this using java web services and eralier mentioned technologies Is it possible to web service contacts opposed player and inform him about opponents move Is there another way to do this with this scope of technologies p  pstrongEditstrong Client application is planned to be desktop application, possibly Java or C.p

These grey rules should align horizontally. p  pThe biggest issue is that, since this is a WordPress theme, each div needs to be able to expand and contract vertically based on the amount of content. That means that if code.descriptioncode on the left gets taller, code.pagetitlecode and code.sidebarcode need to adjust to ensure that the grey rules are aligned. This prevents me from using any fixed heights, which I could figure out a system with. p  pMy first solution was using a combination of absolute and relative positioning use two container divs, code.row1code and code.row2code, both with codeposition relativecode, and add codeposition absolute bottom 0code. This doesnt seem to work, though, without assigning a fixed height to each code.rowcode div, whether I use floats or left 0right 0 to position the individual divs.p  pThe only other solution I can think of is using JavaScript to get the height of the tallest div and adjust margins appropriately, but Im reluctant to use JavaScript for style.

Negative 267 pIm designing a daemon that will continuously read lines from a single text file and process those lines. What is a good general purpose way to keep track of the last line processed, independent of the file name, in the event of lines being written to the text file while the daemon isnt runningp  pEvery so often, the file is archived and a new blank file is created in its place. The daemon will be stopped for the archival to occur.p  pMy first idea, which seems overcomplicated, is to compute and store a hash and line number of the last successfully processed record. Then, when the daemon is started again, run to that line number and calculate the hash. If the hash matches, continue on processing the next record. If the hash doesnt match, start over on the file at the beginning, since that will say this is a new file.p  pI have a feeling there is a good general purpose technique used by log file analyzers or something in a text book that I havent had exposure to.p

Negative 267 pI have been recently challenged with writing a Windows Service. I needed to periodically request a URL and check its availability. For this I decided to initialize a timer in codeOnStartcode method of the service and do all the work in codetimerTickcode event.p  pMy first approach was using codeSystem.Windows.Forms.Timercode and its codeTickcode event. I chose for it, because of the tutorial that I was reading. Somehow I could not make the service work. It installed and started without problems, but it would not fire the event I attached the debugger to the process and saw that it was not fired. I thought that maybe using Forms timer in Windows service is not a good idea, so I decided to switch to codeSystem.Timers.Timercode and utilize its codeElapsedcode event. This did not work either. I tried both mentioned approaches in a Windows Forms application and they both worked.p  pAfter some digging, I found this site a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netsibrahimarchive2004011358429.aspxhttpweblogs.asp.netsibrahimarchive2004011358429.aspxa on which the blogger advices to utilize yet another timer codeSystem.Threading.Timercode. I changed the approach for the third time and emBOOMem it started working like a charm.p  pMy question is why cant I use the other timers in Windows services and why is it so difficult to find an information about itp

The trouble with this is that it gets messy when the UserID is required by UserControls.p  pIs it acceptable to just wrap it in a static method or property in a Utilities class, something like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode    public static int UserID              get                      int userID  0             if HttpContext.Current.User.Identity is FormsIdentity                              FormsIdentity id  FormsIdentityHttpContext.Current.User.Identity                 FormsAuthenticationTicket ticket  id.Ticket                 userID  Int32.Parseticket.UserData                          return userID               codepre  pThis seems to work but I dont know if Im breaking some unwritten rule here. I presume all this stuff is in memory so theres no great overhead in this access.p
Negative 267 pIm a Java pro but an Android newbie, working through the NotePad example.  It uses Intents to work with an eminternalem EditText.

So I settled for making a page which contains the og metadata which I did not want to do and supplied the url for my object. As per the FB Documentation, found a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsopengraphkeyconceptsmechanics relnofollowhereap  preOpen Graph Mechanics  When users take an action in your app, such as cook the Stuffed Cookie, the app calls a Graph API to create a new cook action that connects the user with the Stuffed Cookie object. This is accomplished by issuing a HTTP POST to the users memyappcook connection with the URL of the recipe object. Facebook will then crawl the object URL, read the metadata, and connect the object to users Graph via the action.  The diagram below illustrates the process  User takes an action in the app, such as cook a recipe App calls a Graph API meactionobjectObjectURL Facebook will crawl the object URL, read its meta tags and connects the object to the users Graph via the action.pre  pIt would be cool if we can define these things in the app itself as params for cases where I do not need a website for.p

Negative 267 pSo Ive come across an issue with a site today regarding strange behavior with Google Chrome.  Essentially when the end user uses the built in CTRL  CTRL  functions to change the text size on the page, the images get bigger and all, but the text size remains constant.  Ive gone over the markup and css and cant find anything that would cause this.  The site behaves as expected when the equivalent functions are used in Firefox and I.E. so I am wondering if anyone has any idea what would cause this p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on what I should look for herep

Negative 267 pIm researching ways to communicate with a USB device in Linux and would prefer to not write a Linux Kernel driver. I understand that libusb exists and is a userland library that would work, but our embedded device doesnt support usbfs  and would be really a pain to change kernels to add the support .p  pSo my question is basically this Is it possible  advisable to communicate with a USB device by directly reading and writing to the devUSB or the udev file corresponding to the USB device thus bypassing the need for a custom Linux Driver and usbfsp  pIm hoping its possible to communicate using the USB devices protocol just by reading  writing protocol packets directly through filetype readwrite commands once the devUSB or udev device file is open.p  pThoughts and suggestions please.p  pFOLLOW UPp  pSince the USB device I needed to talk to is a USB HID class device, I was able to use libudev and the standard Linux USB HID RAW driver by reading  writing directly to devhidraw0   or the appropriate devhidraw device . It wasnt necessary to write a custom driver for a simple USB HID device.p

These two tables are created in my Drupal webpage at some point that I dont know because I didnt created the Netbeans project.p  pI checked on the internet and found that probably by adding codeREFERENCES 1sttable idusercode to the second table, it should copy the value of the code1sttablecode that is always created when a new user arrives to the codeidusercode value of the code2ndtablecode that I dont know at which point is created. Is it correctp  pIf its not correct I would like to know a way in pgAdmin that could make me synchronize those tables, or at least create both of them in the same moment.p  pThe problem I have is that the new user has a new row on code1sttablecode automatically as soon as he registers, while to get a new row on code2ndtablecode it needs some kind of activation like inserting all of the data. What Im looking for is a way that as soon as there is a new row in the code1sttablecode, it automatically creates the new row on the other table too. I dont know how to make it more clear English is not my native language.p  pThe solution you gave me seems clear for the question, but the problem is a little bigger the two tables presents different kinds of variables, and it should be that they are, one in mySQL, with the user data drupal default for users, then i have 2 in postgresql, both with the same primary key iduserp  ul lithe first has 118 columns, most of them real integerli lithe second has 50 columns, with mixed types.li ul  pthe web application im using needs both this column with all the values NOT EMPTY otherwise i get a NullPointerException to work, so what im searching for is i thinkp  pwhen the user register inserting his email in drupal, automatically it creates the two fulfilled columns, to make the web automatically works as soon as the email is stored in mysql.

Negative 267 pI am trying to use the jQuery UI 1.9 spinner for the quantity field in a shopping cart application, and have run into a problem affecting IE6  9 and maybe 10, but not Firefox or Chrome.p  pThe issue is that the code I have in the change event of the spinner definition does not fire in IE when the spinner is spun only once, without focus first being applied to the input field itself i.e. just click on either the updown spin button on an unselected spinner and then click off the spinner and no change event fires.p  hr  pEDIT  Ive created a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXseWc4 relnofollowjsfiddlea for this to help illustrate the problem. The problem occurs in IE6  9, I havent tried in 10.p  pIn IE make sure the focus is not on the spinner input field and just click the spinner add arrow once, then click elsewhere on the page. No alert is displayed. Interestingly, the problem does not occur if you put focus into the input field first i.e. click the input field, then the spinner arrow, then click away.p  pThe jsfiddle does show that the change event is not firing, but as its running the source from the jQuery Github page, cant show the extra focus event firing inside the spinners internal workings in IE.p  hr  pTo make sure it wasnt anything Id done, I took a copy of all the demo files in the a hrefhttpsgithub.comjqueryjqueryuitree1.9m7 relnofollowcurrent 1.9m7 milestone releasea and reproduced with that. To confirm the issue I added a few console log messages to see what was happening.p  pIn IE9 an extra focus event fires in the events focus in jquery.ui.spinner.js.p  pThis has the effect of updating this.previous twice, so the first time it is correct as in the other browsers, but the second focus causes this.previous to be set to the same value as the current value, so when the blur event fires and it checks if this.previous  this.element.val they are the same and the change doesnt fire.p  pThis problem does not occur if you spin more than once, as the extra focus doesnt fire so the previous value remains correct. Can anyone help me identify where the extra focus is being triggered, or if theres a workaroundp  pI need a resolution to this for a project at work, and really dont want to have to remove the spinner at this stage. Given jQuerys aim of crossbrowser compatability, I find it hard to believe there is such a fundamental issue affecting crossbrowser compatability for a widget thats been around granted, not yet part of the current release for a few years.

Negative 267 pI work with audio manipulation, generally using Matlab for prototyping, and C for implementation. Recently, I have been reading up on TDD. I have looked over a few basic examples and am quite enthusiastic about the paradigm. p  pAt the moment, I use what I would consider a global testassisted approach. For this, I write signal processing blocks in C, and then I make a simple Matlab mex file that can interface with my classes. I subsequently add functionality, checking that the results match up with an equivalent Matlab script as I go. This works ok, but the tests become obsolete quickly as the system evolves. Furtermore, I am testing the whole system, not just units. p  pIt would be nice to use an established TDD framework where I can have a test suite, but I dont see how I can validate the functionality of the processing blocks without tests that are equally as complex as the code under test. How would I generate the reference signals in a C test to validate a processing block without the test being a form of selffulfilling prophecyp  pIf anyone has experience in this area, or can suggest some methodologies that I could read into, then that would be great.p

Negative 267 pI have a Grails based web app which uses Spring Security to handle user logins etc.  I have hit a bit of a block and am hoping the more experienced might be able to point me in the right direction for a solution.p  pThe application has the concept of messages which can be sent from user to user to provide a instant messaging feature.  There is a timed Ajax call that is present throughout the system which is used to alert the user of any new incoming messages.p  pMy problem is that since I have implemented this, each time the ajax call is performed, of course the users session is being refreshed, therefore never timesout. So a manual log out is the only way they can log out, whereas before expiry of a session would redirect them to the login page.p  pDoes anyone know how I can still accomplish automatic logouts whilst still have the timer functioningp  pIm hoping I can set up some kind of filter with spring security, or perhaps theres an annotation I can use on the periodically called method to instruct it NOT to refresh the users session.p  pAs always any help amp comments are appreciated.p

Sorry my badp  pThough, i made it work using linear layout, which i wanted to avoid because there are more view on top and bottom next to each other so it would lead to nested views using linear layout.

Negative 267 pI would like to get to grips with Zend Framework 2 by using it for a small project. I have been through various blogs articles, docs and of course the fantastic tutorial by Akrabat Rob Allen.p  pHowever, in all my reading I have not come across any explanation on the correct or preferred directory structure for a module that Zend Framework 2 expects.p  pIn the a hrefhttpzf2.readthedocs.orgenlatestindex.htmluserguide relnofollowAkrabat tutoriala Rob Allens example module makes use of a single model and controller.

So his strongAlbumstrong module has a directory, with more strongAlbumstrong directories for the models, controllers and views. If I were to rename his module from strongAlbumstrong to, say, strongMyModulestrong would the directory structure then becomep  precodemodule     MyModule         config         src             Album                 Controller                 Form                 Model         view             MyModule                 album codepre  pWould it then follow that an additional model, strongArtiststrong, and associated controllers would be organised thuslyp  precodemodule     MyModule         config         src             Album                 Controller                 Form                 Model             Artist                 Controller                 Form                 Model         view             MyModule                 album                 artist codepre  pIf not the above, then what structure would it be p  pThis is of course all assuming ZF2 expects a strict structure.

My plan is to divide the data in to 3D cells so I dont have to search the nearest neighbor in the whole dataset. p  pSo in my first step I read in my data files and create an array witch contains code[x,y,z,v[]]code the coordinates of each point and the value for each time.p  pAfter that I calculate for each point the cell it belongs to and append it to a Array of 4 dimensions codexcode, codeycode, codezcode and codevcodep  precodefor vec in vecs     xind  intvec[0]xmin  stepWidthX      yind  intvec[1]ymin  stepWidthY      zind  intvec[2]zmin  stepWidthZ       if xindgridPointsInXdirection         xind  xind1     if yindgridPointsInYdirection         yind  yind1     if zindgridPointsInZdirection         zind  zind1     print zind, yind,xind      XGridPoints[zind, yind, xind]  np.appendXGridPoints[zind, yind, xind], vec[0]     YGridPoints[zind, yind, xind]  np.appendYGridPoints[zind, yind, xind], vec[1]     ZGridPoints[zind, yind, xind]  np.appendZGridPoints[zind, yind, xind], vec[2]     VGridPoints[zind, yind, xind]  np.appendVGridPoints[zind, yind, xind], vec[3] codepre  pWhere codevecscode is the array with all data points. So far its working but my problem now is in codeVGridPointscode I have a long list of values and not a list of arrays. Is there a solution to append an array to an array element so that I can access it later something likep  precodex  XGridPoints[2,3,4][2] y  YGridPoints[2,3,4][2] z  ZGridPoints[2,3,4][2] v[]  VGridPoints[2,3,4][2] codepre  pWhen I take only one time step its working but I have a large overdrive if I recalculate the cells and the nearest neighbour for each time step and they do not change the location over time.p

Negative 267 pposting JSON vs traditional form encoding as the data format for submitting data to the server from a HTML form. The HTML form is dynamic as in, the user can add new rows for example and fill in data. There is an argument that using form fields with an MVC framework is easier in this case since the MVC framework like Spring MVC takes care of the bindings to the form generating ids in the dynamically generated HTML etc and we can have an object on the controller to collect these values when the form is posted using AJAX as a form encoded content type. p  pI was thinking of using JSON, what are your views p  ol liIs using form encoded format the traditional way the better option or is it using JSON as the payload the way to go What are some of the pros and cons you have encounteredli liAre web applications using JSON as the data format for submitting formsli liWe currently do not have any integration with mobile apps etc so is it worth doing JSON over traditional form fields approachli ol  pThanks for your time. p

When I run this code, I end up appending the LAST ROW of the .csv to the list over and over again instead of appending  each dictionary saved temporarily as dataLine to the list correctly  This is all the more confusing because if I replace the line dataList.appenddataLine in my code with print dataLine, the code iterates over the .csv and prints each row individually instead of printing the last row over and over again.p  precodefrom sys import argv import csv   arguments script, csvFile  argv   check input while csvFile.endswith.csv  False     csvFile  rawinputPlease enter a .csv file     open the csv file openFile  opencsvFile, r   read the csv file reader  csv.readeropenFile, delimiter,   extract first row to use as keys for row in range1     keys  reader.next   turn rows into dictionaries with keys FIX THIS PART  NOT WORKING RIGHT length  lenkeys dataLine   dataList  [] for row in reader     for i in rangelength         dataLine[keys[i]]  row[i]     dataList.appenddataLine  for x in dataList     print x     print    close the file openFile.close codepre
Negative 267 pIm in a situation where I need to merge multiple branches of a codebase, one from TFS and one in held by git, into git.

Negative 267 pI am trying to write a threadsafe C logging function, and I am having some serious problems with the file IO.

Does anyone have any idea as to how I could go about fixing this problemp  pAs an aside, I want to be in binary update mode because I will eventually add some trimming functionality that will ensure the log file does not exceed a certain size, and this is easier for me to accomplish with working codefseekcode calls and RW functionality.p  pAny tips are appreciated.  Thanks beforehandp

Negative 267 pI want to run a nested logistic regression in R, but the examples I found online didnt help much. I read over an example from this website a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5906272stepbystepprocedureonhowtorunnestedlogisticregressioninrStep by step procedure on how to run nested logistic regression in Ra which is similar to my problem, but I found that it seems not resolved in the end The questioner reported errors and I didnt see more answers.p  pSo I have 9 predictors continuous scores, and 1 categorical dependent variable DV. The DV is called effect, and it can be divided into 2 general categories negative 0 and positive 1. I know how to run a simple binary logit regression using the general grouping way, i.e., negative 0 and positive 1, but this is not enough. positive can be further grouped into two types physical 1 and mental 2. So I want to run a nested model which includes these 3 categories negative 0, physical 1, and mental 2, and reflects the nature that physical and mental are nested in positive. Maybe R can compare these two models general vs. detailed together So I created two new columns, one is called effect general, in which the individual scores are negative 0 and positive 1 the other is called effect detailed, which contains 3 values  negative 0, physical 1, and mental 2. I ran a simple binary logit regression only using effect general, but I dont know how to run a nested logit model for effect detailed. p  pFrom the example I searched and other materials, the R package mlogit seems right, but Im stuck with how to make it work for my data. I dont quite understand the examples in Rhelp, and this part in the example from this website I mentioned earlier ...shapelong, alt.vartown.list, nestslisttown.list... makes me very confused I can see that my data shape should be wide, but I have no idea what alt.var and nests are...p  pI also looked at page 19 of the mlogit manual for examples of nested logit model calls.

Its either not done in Zsh, or its for another app, for example tmux.

Negative 267 pSimple problem. I have a dataGridView that I set using a DataTable and then I add 2 columns after the DataTable for buttons. When I click a button which has index 6, it gives me index 1 which is my first button.p  precode        DataTable cartResults  cart.RunCartQuerysb.ToString          dgCart.DataSource  cartResults           Add a button to the DataGridView at the specified position         DataGridViewButtonColumn btnEdit  new DataGridViewButtonColumn         btnEdit.Name  btnEdit         btnEdit.Text  Edit         btnEdit.HeaderText  Edit Quantity         btnEdit.UseColumnTextForButtonValue  true         dgCart.Columns.InsertintButtons.Edit, btnEdit          DataGridViewButtonColumn btnDelete  new DataGridViewButtonColumn         btnDelete.Name  btnDelete         btnDelete.Text  Delete         btnDelete.HeaderText  Delete         btnDelete.UseColumnTextForButtonValue  true         dgCart.Columns.InsertintButtons.Delete, btnDelete         dgCart.Columns.AddbtnDelete codepre  pI dont know why the index being returned is one which is the Edit Button and not my Delete Button which is index 6. Any ideasp  hr  pThe source of the problem is that the DataGridView.DataSource is a DataTable, I then add 2 button columns after the datasource is set. Even though Ive added the buttons at index 1 and 6, the DatagridView thinks they are at index 0 and 1. Even though the Grid looks fine on the form.p

Negative 267 pWhat is the best way to retrieve  data from multiple websitespages and put them on 1 single application that gets autoupdated say ,I want to take an article from yahoo, and another one from bbc and another one from the times then put them on a sort of listview, that gets autoUpdated, how would I go for that I heard about JSON, but Since Im new in jQuery Mobile programming, Im not sure how this will work.

Negative 267 pI have a very simple MYSQL database with only 3 columns but several millions of rows.  Two of the colums hid1, hid2 describe study objects about 50,000 of them and the third column score is the result of a comparison of hid1 with hid2. Thus, the number of rows is maxhid1maxhid2, which is quite a big number. Because the table has to be written only once and read many million times, I selected a MyISAM table I hope this was a good idea. Initially, it was planned that I would retrieve score for a given pair of hid1,hid2 but it turned out to be more convenient to retrieve all scores and hid2 for a given hid1.p  pMy table result looks like thisp  precode  Field  Type                   Null  Key  Default  Extra    hid1   mediumint8 unsigned  YES   MUL  NULL             hid2   mediumint8 unsigned  YES        NULL             score  float                  YES        NULL             codepre  pand a typical query would bep  precodeselect hid1,hid2,score from result where hid113531 into outfile tmpttt codepre  pHere is the problem The query just takes too long, at least sometimes. For some hid1 values, I get the result back in under a second. For other hid1 particularly for big numbers, I have to wait for up to 40 sec. As I said, I have to run thousands of these queryies, so I am interested in speeding things up.p  pLet me reiterate there are about 50,000 hits to the query, and I dont need them in any particular order. Am I doing something wrong here, or is a relational database like MySQL not up to this taskp  pWhat I already tried is to increase the keybuffer in etcmysqlmy.conf this appeared to help, but not much. The index on hid1 is a few GB, does the keybuffer have to be bigger than the index size to be effectivep  pAny hint would be appreciated.p  hr  pEdit  here is an example run with the corresponding explain outputp  precodeselect hid1,hid2,score from result where hid1132885 into outfile tmpttt Query OK, 16465 rows affected 31.88 sec codepre  pAs you can see below, the index hid1idx is actually being usedp  precodemysqlgt explain select hid1,hid2,score from result where hid1132885 into outfile tmpttt   id  selecttype  table   type  possiblekeys  key         keylen  ref    rows   Extra           1  SIMPLE       result  ref   hid1index     hid1index  4        const  15456  Using where   codepre  p1 row in set 0.00 secp  pWhat I do find puzzling is the fact that query with low numbers for hid1 always are much faster than those with high numbers.

Negative 267 pFirst of all, please excuse my shortcomings in presenting my issue as I havent got much knowledge in VBA. Your help would be kindly appreciated.p  pI am working on a project that would imply putting the content of three different Excel files from three different subfolders into one Excel file, and then run some macros in order to process the data they contain. Since Ive already set the processing macros, my issue relies in importing the content correctly.p  pThe problem Im facing is that I dont have the exact names of the files I would like to open, and that they would change each month. Therefore, I cant use the WorkBooks.Open command that requires a precise name. However, the files have predictable name formats. For instance, one of the subfolders will be comprised of files named XXXjan2013.xls, another one january2013XXX and the last one XXX012013.p  pMy goal would be to input the month and year manually, for instance 012013, and then open all the files containing January, jan or 01 in their names.p  pHeres what I have so far, with commentsp  precodeSub ChosenDate It aims at opening a box in which the desired month would be written manually Dim InputDate As String These are the indications the user will get     InputDate  InputBoxPromptPlease choose a month.,              TitleDate, DefaultMMYYYY In case the person forgets to write what hes asked to           If InputDate  MMYYYY Or            InputDate  vbNullString Then           Exit Sub If he does it correctly, I call the second Sub          Else Call FilesOpening         End If End Sub So far, everything works fine  Public Sub FilesOpening This one aims at opening the chosen files Dim ThisFile               As String Dim Files                    As String  Defining the folder in which the file is, as it can change from a computer to another ThisFile  ThisWorkbook.Path Heres where I start struggling and where the macro doesnt work anymore If I wanted to open all the files of the folder, I would just write that Files  DirThisFile amp .xls You never know On Error Resume Next Creating the Loop Do While Files ltgt vbNullString Files  Dir Set wbBook  Workbooks.OpenThisWorkbook.Path amp  amp Files Loop End Sub But it doesnt look inside of subfolders, neither does it consider the date Sub DataProcess This one is fine, except I cant find a way to name the files correctly.

Negative 267 pI have this program that needs to do some comparisons of strings in an array. The first thought one would have is of course to just use codestrcmpcode to check whether two strings in the array are the same. Now consider the option that you just need to compare the pointers to the strings. This would involve some preparations to map each element that are literally the same to the same place in memory.p  pIve done all this, by preparing with codestrcmpcode, and now with codestrstrcode which I believe is faster.

Negative 267 pI am having some confusion trying to best design my application. In Android Studio when I add a new module it basically seems to just create an entirely new application. I am confused on what the benefit of this could actually be. When would someone want add a module like this to their project and not simply just create a new application Also, is it a good idea to use this feature on Android Should I instead merely use packages and reuse my code that way Doing an internet search has gotten me nowhere as it appears all different types of languages treat modularization and packages as somewhat different. I have always just imported classes to reuse my code, and I am afraid that I seem to be missing some fundamental OO principle by not using modules. If someone could please fill me in on what this great mystery is, or some good reading material I will be greatly appreciative. p

Negative 267 pI have disabled swapping altogether on my OS X 10.8.2 which runs x86 LP64 kernel box for experimental reasons, I know this is a bad idea.p  pWhen I do a system call from any app what does the address space layout look like  I.e. Now as entire address space is wired down  no swapping  can I deterministically access any valid user address from kernel and assume that page containing that address is resident in memory p  pMy understanding is yes but I am a bit confused after reading that no matter whether user space is 64 bit or 32 bit OS X kernel always runs in 32 bit mode and entire process adress space get switched out and entire 4G is taken by kernel. Is this applicable for 10.8.2  If this is the case then I will not be able to access any valid user space address from kernel space, rightp
Negative 267 pIve been building an app to track stock prices. The user should see a window with an entry widget and a button that creates a new frame with a label and a button. The label is the stock price and symbol, the button is a delete button, and should hide that frame if clicked.p  pIve rewritten this program 4 times now, and its been a great learning experience, but what Ive learned is that I cant have the miniframes being called from methods part of the main GUI class  this funks up the delete buttons, and updates the value behind codeframe.packforgetcode so it only deletes the last item ever. p  pIve moved my miniframe widgets down into the class for the actual stock values. Ive packed them what I assume to be correct but they dont show up. They also dont error out, which isnt very helpful. Heres my code, although Ive omitted a lot of the functional parts to show what is happening with my frames.

Negative 267 pemIs there a way to calculate codetransformorigincodes effect on a rotated elements position more like offset with respect to the document, regardless of the angleemp  pLets say we have a square, code100px  100pxcode element that is rotated strong90 degreesstrong, and its codetransformorigincode is code50px 50pxcode. As we can see from the picture below, the rotation origin is the center. emThe white dot indicates the transformation origin.emp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh6X2K.png altThe white dot indicates the transformation origin.p  pBut when we move the transformation origin, the element moves too. If we increase the transformation origins xaxis by code1pxcode codetransformorigin 51px 50pxcode, the element seems to move strongupstrong code1pxcode and strongrightstrong code1pxcode. Respectively, on the origins yaxis a code1pxcode increase codetransformorigin 50px 51pxcode moves the element strongdownstrong code1pxcode and strongrightstrong code1pxcode. So changes to even one of the transformation origins axis values affect the elements position on both axes. If the origins both values are increased in the same ratio, the effects kind of cancel each other out or reinforce each other. p  pHere is the same square with the codetransformorigincode set as code75px 75pxcode, where the origins yvalues downeffect has canceled the xvalues upeffect, so the element has remained in the same position yaxiswise.

Negative 267 pI have been working with quickfix and Visual Studio and see that I can initialize an instance of FIX42NewOrderSingle from a FIX41NewOrderSingle with no compiler issues or even issues during runtime.

Negative 267 pI am attempting to create a SharePoint 2013 Online App that will process documents stored on the host site collection.p  pIm able to use jQuery ajax to retrieve a file from the host site collection and the format I receive it in appears to be a byte stream which jQuery appears to store as a string or at least, the data is being interpreted as a string by the browser Im using to debug.p  pMy conclusion is that I should be sending the received file to a WCF application in order to use C to write the stream to a file on the file system of the WCF service and then extract the content of the resulting file. The resulting file, however, is corrupt. My assumption is that somewhere in the process SharePoint host to jQuery on App or App to WCF application the original data is corrupted.p  pMy questions arep  ul liIs this the simplest method of processing documents using an App orbr is there a simpler method of extracting the content of documents onbr host sitesli liAssuming my current approach is the best approach, is    there any way to prevent the file corruption Im experiencingli ul  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 267 pI am using an interactive map web service that I embed in a web page which I am using to show an interactive floor plan for an exhibit hall.The web service uses css and javascript which reside on the vendors servers. I can modify the CSS and use it locally on my server but not allowed to modify the javascript. When a user does a mouseover on a booth on the floor plan, the booth becomes highlighted and a tooltiplike blurb appears giving information about the booth tenant. I can go directly to a highlighted booth on the floor plan using the parameter for example www.mypage.commymap.htmhotspot100, and this will go to the interactive floor plan page and highlight booth 100 and shows the blurb. At this point, the user can move the mouse to another booth and the focus now goes to the new booth, which is highlighted, etc. I want it so that once the user gets to the floor plan page from the parameter in the link, all other mouseovers are disabled so that even if the user moves the mouse to another booth, nothing happens and the focus remains on the initial booth. I am not a CSS or javascript expert, but any help with this is greatly appreciated. If I have to create a separate duplicated floor plan page just to deal with the parameters so that I can adjust the CSS just for that page only and not the main floor plan page without the parameters, then thats fine. I am using the map via a webview in an iOS app, but I cannot seem to find a native iOS code solution for this, so I am hoping it can be done via CSS.p  pThe CSS code is belowp  precodemaTour  backgroundcolorffffff height793px positionrelative width1200px  maPopup  textalignleft  .maPopup, .maPopupPinned   maTooltip  zindex10000 visibilityhidden positionabsolute bordersolid 1px 808080 color000000 backgroundcolorfff8dc fontsize8px fontfamilyArial, Helvetica, sansserif padding4px fontweightnormal fontstylenormal textdecorationnone maxwidth200px  maLayout  textalignleft height793px paddingtop0px paddingright0px paddingbottom0px paddingleft0px width1200px  maAbsBlock  overflowhidden positionabsolute  maHotspotTitle  backgroundcolorddffff color1f497d fontfamilyVerdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize12px fontstylenormal fontweightbold  maTextArea  backgroundcolorddffff  maHotspotText  backgroundcolorddffff color000000 fontfamilyVerdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize11px fontstylenormal fontweightnormal  maMap  backgroundcolorffffff  .maInstructions, maInstructionsTitle     fontfamilyArial fontsize12px  .maInstructions  padding6px bordersolid 1px 777  .maInstructionsTitle  fontweightbold marginbottom4px  .maZoomControl   zindex4000 positionabsolute top4px left4px cursorpointer webkittaphighlightcolorrgba0,0,0,0  codepre

The frame variable stores the actual value drawn to the screenjust posting that code, to make sure there is no fault, eventhough i checked it already.  Now the problem is that i cant turn off the IsFixedTimeStep. I set it to false inside the constructor, initialize and even the updatemethod but still the programm limits my fps to 60. I either put in a for query into my updatemethod running many million loops without framedrops to make sure its not my cpu beeing too slow .Another thing i already tried is to use my own timeSpan and the systemtime to get the elapsed time between the calls of Update, wich gives me kinda the same output. Now it is 99 sure that update only runs 60 times a second.p  pSo why cant i call the UpdateMethod as often as possible as it should be when IsFixedTimeStep is falsep  pTy for repliesp

But in the channel list, the GoogleYouTube account also appears. This account isnt linked with any channels directly.p  pIn my app, the users are supposed to select only a channel. My question is, how can I tell if the user selected a channel and not the GoogleYouTube account Is there some method in the YouTube API that can help me knowp  pI noticed that if the user has selected a channel and I call the channelslist method then the information it returns is as expected but if I call the same method having selected the GoogleYouTube account then the channel title is empty. But Id like to know if there is some other nicer and cleaner way to tell if the user has selected a channel or an account.p  pThanksp

Negative 267 pWell I was wondering how to create domain models given Javas ResultSet Object in data mappers. I read Martin Fowlers book, and in his examples he was loading each field from ResultSet into local variables in the data mappers method that creates domain models and then pass all these local variables to the domain models constructor one by one. p  pThe problem is that it only works if the table contains like 25 columns, otherwise you end up with 10 local variables and a constructor that accepts 10 parameters. I dont like constructors or methods that accept more than 5 parameters, 10 is way too many. Not mentioning that my domain models constructors also have arguments from dependency injection, such as UnitOfWork. In a word, I dont want to mess up the constructors signature. p  pI have two possible solutions, but both seem to have issues. I can definitely pass the entire ResultSet into domain models constructor, this way the constructor will only have 23 parameters. There is also an issue involved with this, the domain model and the domain layer is now aware of the existence of ResultSet. As far as I know, the data mapper is supposed to serve as a mediator between domain models and resultsets. If the domain model is directly manipulating resultset, it is a bad architectural design. In a long run it will cause even more problems. p  pI can also create an empty domain model first and then use its setter methods to add values to its fields. The problem with this approach is that, well, I have a UnitOfWork monitoring the domain models state as new, dirty, removed or clean. The mechanism of UnitOfWork is that whenever the domain models setter methods are invoked, it marks the object as dirty and pending for DB update. Consequently, using the empty domain model  setter approach leads to the object being marked as dirty each time the setter is invoked. Even though I can mark the domain model as clean before returning it, the entire process is still slow when I am loading a collection of objects. p  pSo what do you think Is there an alternative way to create domain model given a Java ResultSet that is both elegant and not resourceconsuming I am out of ideas...p

I am also using a NavgationDrawer and the problem I am having is that when I navigate to this item the animation of closing the drawer isnt smooth it kind of hangs for a second and snaps shut Its pretty obvious to me that this is caused by the fact that this appending and the closing of the drawer are happening on the same thread, but Im not sure how to resolve this issue.  If I could figure out how to delay the append or something like that it would probably help.  I dont think async would be of any use since it is ultimately going to run on the UI thread. p

Negative 267 pOk, so Im going to explain my program.br It takes a text file thats setup as such in pairs, first line being the title of an experiment, and the second line being 10 numbers separated by spaces. It saves the first lines of pairs in codeexperimentscode and the second lines of pairs in codedatacode. The last line is code END code which is what its supposed to end with.  p  pFor some reason code END code doesnt end the program.

Negative 267 pI looked everywhere in the questions previously asked, and although some users had similar problems, none of the solutions worked for me.p  pMy problem is that I have a Swing interface main app which provides a graphical way of working with sockets. The program allows the user to openclose sockets in client or server mode for UDP or TCP protocols. The Class that manages the TCP server connections, provides an interface for firing events client connected, client disconnected, new message, etc. The main app implements that interface, and upgrade the Swing interface accordingly.p  pThe mainapp goes something like thisp  precode    public class mainapp implements TCPServerListener     private tcpServer TCPServer     Launch the application.   public static void mainString[] args      EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable          public void run              try                  mainapp window  new mainapp                 window.frmUdptcpPruebas.setVisibletrue              catch Exception e                  e.printStackTrace                               private void startTCPServer               TCPServer new tcpServernew mainapp,              TCPServer.setListeningIPthis.textFieldIpLocal.getText               TCPServer.startTcpServer         Create the application.   public pruebas      initialize       Initialize the contents of the frame.   private void initialize      .     .The swing interface has many more components, but Im just showing the     .connect button to make the code more readable     .     btnConectar.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent arg0              botonconectarpresionado                 startTCPServer                       .     .     .     .

I know the code is indeed executed, because it prints the id of the clients, but the combobox is never NEVER upgraded doesnt matter if Im changing the interface inside the EDT thread or not. I also checked the combobox.itemcount before and after the insert, and it is inserting the item, is just not upgrading the interface.p  pIve also tried many of the soluctions suggested here like using refresh, validate, revalidate and a long etc.p  pSo, what is going on Is it because the event is fired from a thread in another objectp

Negative 267 pI have gone through the documentation, and I am embarrassed to say I am confused.p  pstrongThe Scenariostrongp  pI have a codeUIViewcode, that acts like a container for 3 codeUIButtonscode. This container is initially of bounds code0, 0, 35, 35code, with each button inside with the same coordinates with codealphacode 0. On a specific action by the user, the container changes bounds to code0, 0, 100, 35code, and the button are animated to xorigin 5, 35, and 65, respectively, with codealphacode 1, such that they are spread out inside the resized container. I refer to this as the emexpanded stateem of the container. The same action by the user, toggles it back to the original emcontracted stateem.p  pstrongThe Goalstrongp  pI am currently doing this using the code[UIView animateWithDuration]code block, but would like to use the codeUIDynamicAnimatorcode to add a bouncy effect, such that, when toggling to expanded state , the container resizes with a bounce resizes a bit extra, and bounces back to target bounds, and the buttons bounce as well move a bit further, and bounce back to their target bounds.p  pstrongThe Confusionstrongp  pcodeUIDynamicAnimatorcode, codeUIDynamicBehaviorcode, codeUIAttachmentBehaviorcode, codeUIDynamicItemcode.....all these are causing my understanding of codeUIKitDynamiccode to overflow. I think I should be using strongcodeUISnapBehaviorcodestrong, but I do not know how to go about it.p

On the second clock cycle after, the divisor register is loaded and the calculation is made for the next three clock cycles.p  pThe V signal is the output to signify that an overflow has occured the result cant be fit into the five bits of the quotient, my st is the start signal to start the process, sh is the shift signal for the shift register, su is the subtract signal for the subtractor.p  precode library IEEE  use IEEE.STDLOGIC1164.all  use IEEE.STDLOGICARITH.all  use IEEE.STDLOGICUNSIGNED.all   entity Divider is          Port busin in stdlogicvector8 downto 0                    St, Clk, reset in stdlogic                   Quotient out stdlogicvector4 downto 0                   Remainder out stdlogicvector2 downto 0                   v out stdlogic  end Divider  architecture Behavioral of Divider is  signal State, NextState integer range 0 to 5  signal C, Ld1, Ld2, Su, Sh stdlogic  signal Divisor stdlogicvector2 downto 0  signal Subout stdlogicvector3 downto 0  signal Dividend stdlogicvector8 downto 0  begin          Subout lt Dividend8 downto 5  0 amp divisor          C lt not Subout 3          Remainder lt Dividend7 downto 5          Quotient lt Dividend4 downto 0 StateGraph process State, St, C  begin          Ld1 lt 0           Ld2lt0           v lt 0           Sh lt 0           Su lt 0           case State is                  when 0 gt                          if St  1 then                                   Ld1 lt 1                                   NextState lt 1                          else                                   NextState lt 0                           end if                  when 1 gt                         if St  1 then                                   Ld2 lt 1                                   NextState lt 2                          else                                   Ld2lt1                                  NextState lt 2                           end if                  when 2 gt                          if C  1 then                                   v lt 1                                   NextState lt 0                          else                                   Sh lt 1                                   NextState lt 3                           end if                  when 3  4  gt                          if C  1 then                                   Su lt 1                                   NextState lt State                           else                                   Sh lt 1                                   NextState lt State  1                           end if                  when 5 gt                          if C  1 then                                   Su lt 1                           end if                           NextState lt 0          end case  end process StateGraph  Update process Clk  begin          if Clkevent and Clk  1 then                  State lt NextState                  if Load  1 then                           Dividend lt 0 amp busin                   end if                   if Ld1  1 then                         Dividend lt 0ampBusin7 downto 0                  end if                 if Ld2  1 then                         Divisor lt Busin2 downto 0                  end if                  if Su  1 then                          Dividend8 downto 5 lt Subout                          Dividend0 lt 1                  end if                  if Sh  1 then 94                          Dividend lt Dividend7 downto 0 amp 0                  end if          end if  end process update  end Behavioral  codepre  pHeres my input and outputs [Signals] a hrefhttpimgur.comfqfiYJZ relnofollowhttpimgur.comfqfiYJZa a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commfK1r.png relnofollow1a img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commfK1r.png altuploaded imagep  pThe picture shows that my registers for the divisor and dividend is loading correctly.

Negative 267 pIm working on a project that requires the Core Data database to be backed up somehow so that the data wont be lost if user deletes and redownloads the app.p  pIn the iOS storage guideline it statesp  blockquote   pOnly documents and other data that is usergenerated, or that cannot otherwise be recreated by your application, should be stored in the Documents directory and will be automatically backed up by iCloud.p blockquote  pI wonder whether it means that if I put my Core Data sqlite database in the Documents directory, it will get backed up automatically by iCloudp  pIf not, is there any simple solution for backing up the Core Data database I just need the database to be recoverable after app being removed and reinstalled.

Negative 267 pIm looking to find if its possible to store characters from multiple languages with widely varying character set e.g. Latin and Japanese alphabet into a codeVARCHARcode column in SQL Server 200812 DB. I read about the concept of collations in sql server. I cannot change the data type to codeNVARCHARcode.

This class is first initialised in controller 1 and during the prepareForSegue method set as the value of a property of controller 2 called refineModel.p  pIn controller 2 I pass a copy of the model to controller 3 using the prepareForSegue method againp  precode voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender      if [[[sender titleLabel] text] isEqualToStringGender]          VAGRefineGenderViewController vc  [segue destinationViewController]         [vc setDelegateself]         [vc setRefineModel[[self refineModel] copy]]       codepre  pOnce customer lands on controller 3 they check what ever boxes are appropriate. Then by tapping the done button or tapping back the details are saved in the copy of the model. I use NSUserDefaults to track the status of my switches. This isnt important right now. The issue Im having is after the customer returns to controller 2 their checkbox selection is displayed underneath the refine by option they chose. In my example you see underneath gender my selection is shown.p  pOk this is fine but now when I tap on lets say brand to choose some more ways to refine my results then return back to controller 2 selection for gender is cleared and blank. I assume because the prepareForSegue method creates a new copy of my model to set as controller 3s refineModel property value.p  pI need a way to temporarily keep track of the selections made before the apply button is tapped. The apply button saves my copy model as the original models value. This is in place so that if a customer decides they dont wish to apply the selections they have made and return to controller 1 without tapping apply the original or previous selections if any, are returned. p  pstrongMore infostrongp  pI need a clear way to keep hold of all the data selected in controller 3.

Negative 267 pThis is my scenario Im doing communication between devices on a wireless network. When two devices are communicating but their connection drops unexpectedly, messages are automatically buffered until they are able to connect to each other again. This means I need to periodically every X seconds update a list of everyone who is available on the current network since its many devices connecting to many others. When some client is discovered who may have been forcefully disconnected earlier, this means some messages may be buffered for this client.p  pRefreshing the list of devices on the network every X seconds seems like a job for a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.timervvs.110.aspx relnofollowcodeSystem.Threading.Timercodea. The thing is that Im worried about data race conditions when this timer thread will try to send messages, but the main thread might try to send the remaining messages too for a different reason.p  pSo Im wondering  can I raise an event on the main thread from within the codeSystem.Threading.Timercode thread Or how would I approach this otherwise, considering any method needs to work on both Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 Store apps.p

Negative 267 pI am implementing an EventSourcing application that handles a large number of original and derived data points. In short, we have an codePersistentActorcode functioning as an emAggregate Rootem accepting commandsp  precodeUpdateValuename, value, timestamp UpdateValuename, value, timestamp UpdateValuename, value, timestamp codepre  pAfter these commands are verified, they produce events which are persisted and update the statep  precodeValueUpdatedname, value, timestamp ValueUpdatedname, value, timestamp ValueUpdatedname, value, timestamp codepre  pIn a codePersistentViewcode we listen to these events and calculate derived valuesp  precodecase v  ValueUpdatedvalueicareabout, ,  gt calculatederivedvaluesv case v  ValueUpdatedanothervalueicareabout, ,  gt calculatederivedvaluesv codepre  pBut this recalculation itself is a new value on which other views could depend, so that means that we have to send a new command back to the aggregate root to process the new value, which can produce events that can be picked up by this or other views.p  pIs it acceptable for a view to produce events or commands I would think a views responsibility is to update a state based on events, not produce events or commands. Also, the order in which events arrive can influence the new events being broadcast during replay.p  pIs it necessary to produce commands instead of events Since the command was updating the initial value, you could argue that producing all the derived values are simply events that are the result of the command being processed, although they are generated in a distributed fashion and not directly by the aggregate root.p  pIve been looking at Akkas Reactive Streams that could be used to string these actors together, and also looked at the idea of Sagas as presented here a hrefhttpblog.jonathanoliver.comcqrssagaswitheventsourcingpartiofii relnofollowhttpblog.jonathanoliver.comcqrssagaswitheventsourcingpartiofiia. In that post Jonathan mentionsp  blockquote   pSagas listen to events and dispatch commands while aggregates receive commands and publish events.p blockquote  pThat seems like a sensible approach as well, to implement all these actors as FSMs wait 5 seconds for related events, recalculate everything, dispatch command, wait 5 seconds for events, etc.p  pTo make things a little bit more interesting, the streams of values can be out of order and incomplete, but should produce derived values at points in time. So if I receive values A amp Bp  ul liA1, B1, B2, A2, B3, A4, B4li ul  pit should produce derived values Dp  ul liD1 A1  B1, D2 B2  A2, D3 B3  A2, there is no A3, D4 A4  B4li ul  pThis means I have to keep track of order, and sometimes reissue a derived value if a missing value comes in.p  pThanksp

Negative 267 pWhen I originally wrote the API for my website, I wanted to have it as a subdomain like so codeapi.example.comcode. That worked. Now I am changing it so api can only work when trying to access it as part of the URLL codeexample.comapi...code. Now this works except locally codeapi.example.comapi...code works still. More interesting is the fact that some random subdomain does not work. On the production site though any subdomain works, which is not what I want. Is there a way to ensure that subdomains arent caught by the root in Rails 4 p  pAs an extra question that hopefully is answered, but doesnt have to be, how can I redirect to another subdomain using the routes. I havent been able to figure it out and I am wondering if it is possible.p

Negative 267 pHow can you avoid caching an error result with ASPASMX WebMethod with a CacheDuration propertyp  pLets say you have a WebMethod that adds two numbers so it has two number parameters and also has an account ID parameter. If say the account ID is an expired account, the answer to those 3 parameters would be Error Expired Account. If you have a cache duration of 10 minutes, if the account gets fixed in 1 minute, and that method is called again within 10 minute expiration period with same 3 parameters, doesnt it return the error message that is cachedp  pIs there a way to avoid caching a result if its an error message p

Negative 267 pWelcome to the 1990s,p  pI am using an old Mac os 7.01 API, and I need to define a Rect struct with an array of four constants. Sadly, I always get the requires constant error on that Rect definition. We are talking about a 24 year old compiler, though.p  precodeRect shapeRect  100, 100, 200, 200  Works  const int shapeSize  10 int shapeX  0  Cannot be const int shapeY  0  Cannot be const  Rect shapeRect  shapeX  shapeSize, shapeY  shapeSize, shapeX  shapeSize, shapeY  shapeSize   Error requires constant codepre  pIve tried defining multiple const with all the 4 values calculated, but I still get the same error on the same line.p  precodeconst shapeRectT  shapeX  shapeSize ...  Rect shapeRect  shapeRectT, ... codepre  pMy guess is that the shapeRectT const is not a constant I am a beginner in C, but I believe this problem is probably easy to repair, but this is an old compiler, and things may be different, and I dont know if newer C standards changed things about this stuff.p  pEDIT I found the documentation for this API QuickDraw a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlegacylibrarydocumentationmacpdfImagingWithQuickDraw.pdf relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlegacylibrarydocumentationmacpdfImagingWithQuickDraw.pdfap
Negative 267 pRight now I have a Universal Project which contains mostly business logic and models. These I can access from both the Windows Phone project AND the Windows project.p  pBut when I add a Background Task, I would like to access that shared logic as well, because otherwise Id have to duplicate most of my code in my background task.p  pI know you can do Add as Link, but this causes compilation errors like thisp  blockquote   pMethod MyProject.Model.Playlist.Tracks.get has a parameter of type System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection in its signature. Although this generic type is not a valid Windows Runtime type, the type or its generic parameters implement interfaces that are valid Windows Runtime types. Consider changing the type System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection in the method signature to one of the following types instead System.Collections.Generic.IList, System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList, System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable.p blockquote  pThese can be worked away, by either using the strongcodeinternalcodestrong keyword on functions  classes where needed, or strongconvertingstrong my code to the suggested types.p  pUnfortunately, I dont think this is possible in my case, because SQLiteNetExtensions uses the properties to determine its relations, and only certain types are supported codeListcode, codearraycode, and I added codeObservableCollectioncode.p  pSo Im looking for a way to share code between my Shared project and my BackgroundTask, without getting into the valid Windows Runtime type errors.p

Negative 267 ptwo part questionp  pstrong1strongp  pI am using a session state refresh to hold count of the page reloads but when using a series of codeifcode statements the validation isnt working. Code at the bottom. What am I doing wrong p  pstrong2strong Using session state against postback doesnt appear to be the most efficient method of doing this, if I added another table with the same functionality, the count would affect both tables. For example if I only wanted people to be able to add a maximum of three rows to a table, on two tables, they would only be able to add four rows in total.p  pWhat would be a better method of storing a count for separate refreshesp  pstrongUpdatestrong I have found the issue with the code not adding rows to the existing but Im unsure of how to fix it.p  pBasically each iteration is deleting the existing row then adding a single row again.

Negative 267 pIm trying to use inputssuch as use rawinput to create stacks. Input The first line of the input contains the total number of stack operations N, 0 lt N  100000. Each of the next N lines contains a description of a stack operation, either in the form PUSH A B meaning to push B into stack A, or in the form POP A meaning to pop an element from stack A, where A is the number of stack 1  A  1000, and B is an integer 0  B  109. You may assume, that every operation is correct i.e., before each POP operation, the respective stack is not empty.p  pOutput For each POP operation, described in the input, output the value, which this POP operation gets from the top of that stack, to which it is applied.

Negative 267 pI am working on a large test project consisting of thousands of integration tests. It is a bit messy with lots of code duplication.

This kind of code is spread out and duplicated in tests, test base classes, and helpers. p  pWhat I want is to have a single test data builder, having a single responsibility, generate test data which is consumed by the tests. p  pOne approach is to have a class with a bunch of static methods like followingp  precodeSomething CreateSomething     return new Something       set default dummy values  codepre  pand an overloadp  precodeSomething CreateSomethingparams     return new Something       create the Something from the params  codepre  pAnother approach is to have xml files containing the data but i am afraid then it would be too far away from the tests.p  pThe goal is to move this kind of code out of the tests because right now the tests are big and not readable.

Negative 267 pIm looking for an answer that can help me emdesign a Table View for my message listem.  Users see a list of people they can message from a REST API, and if they click on one person, it takes them to a child for messaging. Once they unwind from that child, theyre brought back into the message list but that cell will be pushed to the top.  Pretty standard messaging.p  pMy REST API is standard pagination.  codewww.something.commessagesstart0ampnum20code .  I currently do pagination using codescrollViewDidScrollcode.  When the user scrolls to the bottom, I fetch the next 20 results and append it to the master array of objects.p  pThe problem Im currently facing is...how do you update the table and order of the cells without clearing the entire table and drawing it again Right now, in my codeviewWillAppearcode, Im clearing the table and fetching0, 20 every time.  This is obviously a problem, because if the user has 100 people on the list, scrolls down to message someone, goes to the detailed child view, and unwinds back, then my code will reset the entire table and the user will start at the strongtopstrong again horrible, with only strong20strong cells. They have to scroll down again....which is very troubling. p  pMy REST API orders cells by their last message time.  So, if someone scrolls down to message someone, goes to a child, send a message, and unwinds back to the list, that cell should be at the top. p  pWhen users get a push notification for an individual cell, I also want that cell to pop to the top, without changing any of the other rows.p  pHow can this be designed p  pHeres my codep  precodeimport UIKit   class Match User     var description String     var unread Bool     func setUseruserid String, fbid String, firstname String, descriptionString, unread Bool         self.userid  userid         self.fbid  fbid         self.firstname  firstname         self.unread  unread         self.description  description        class MatchesTableViewController UITableViewController  , UIScrollViewDelegate     let center  NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter     let queue  NSOperationQueue.mainQueue     var matches  [Match]     var roomOfMessages String     var toUserOfMessages User     private var loadingData  false       private struct Storyboard         static let CellReuseIdentifier  Match           override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad            override func viewWillAppearanimated Bool          super.viewWillAppeartrue          fetchMatches0, num CONSTANTS.MatchesNum              override func scrollViewDidScrollscrollView UIScrollView          let currentOffset  scrollView.contentOffset.y         let maximumOffset  scrollView.contentSize.height  scrollView.frame.size.height         if maximumOffset  currentOffset lt 0 ampamp matches.count gt CONSTANTS.MatchesNum.toInt              var start  Stringmatches.count             fetchMatchesstart, num CONSTANTS.MatchesNum                     func fetchMatchesstart String, num String         if self.loadingData              printlnFetching   start             self.loadingData  true             apiClient.listMatchesstart, num num  responseJSON gt  Void in                 dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue  gt Void in                     if start  0                         self.matches  [] reset the table.                                          forindexString, stuff JSON in response[data][users]                         var match  Match                         match.setUserstuff[userid].string, fbid stuff[fbid].string, firstname stuff[firstname].string, description stuff[description].string, unread stuff[unread].bool                         self.matches.appendmatch                                          if response[data][users].count gt 0                         self.tableView.reloadData                                          self.loadingData  false                                                   override func tableViewtableView UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UITableViewCell          let cell  tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierStoryboard.CellReuseIdentifier, forIndexPath indexPath as MatchTableViewCell         cell.match  matches[indexPath.row]         return cell           override func numberOfSectionsInTableViewtableView UITableView gt Int          return 1           override func tableViewtableView UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section Int gt Int          return matches.count           override func tableViewtableView UITableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath          var match  matches[indexPath.row]         toUserOfMessages  match         do stuff         performSegueWithIdentifierCONSTANTS.SegueMatchesToMessages, sender view            override func prepareForSeguesegue UIStoryboardSegue, sender AnyObject          if segue.identifier  CONSTANTS.SegueMatchesToMessages              if let child  segue.destinationViewController.contentViewController as MessagesViewController                 if let messagesroom  roomOfMessages                       do stuff                                                 codepre

Negative 267 pEDIT emreason for this request. This edit has been added when the solution has been found for the sake of describing my needs. I had a Carousel that showed a logical sequence step 1, step 2, step 3.. That carousel is not a top of page, so I want it to stay stopped  paused until the user sees it and when it will see it, as first, I want the user to see the first slide, step 1. Nevertheless, some users and they are not few, believe me dont know about carousels and sliders, so I dont wanna miss their view on the subsequent slides. This is the reason for what follow.emp  pIm wondering about thisp  pI have a bootstrap 3.1 carousel that is strongnotstrong at top of the home page.p  pInstead you reach it when scrolling down some bootstrap rows.p  pWell Id like it to keep the carousel stopped  paused until the user will scroll the page down to where the carousel is placed lets say the carousel height is 500 pixel, when at least the first top 150 pixels are entered in the viewable areap  pwhen those 150 pixel have been scrolled in, the pause  stop should turn to play and so, if the pause between each slide is 5000 msec, after 5000 msec the next slide should turn.p  pAccording with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23459861resettwiiterbootstrapcarouselwhenscrollsofpagethis solutiona it is matter of javascript but it is not what Im seeking for also excuse me but currently Im not so strong with javascript and jquery, so thank you for any hint with some explanation.p  pThank youp  pEDIT 01 a hrefhttpupshots.orgjavascriptjquerytestifelementisinviewportvisibleonscreen relnofollowThis scripta looks to be the correct and also a great solution , especially reading the comments at bottom of that page, but as stated above, I miss the knowledge to properly take advantage of it, thank you for any hint.p  pEDIT 02 Ive self answered this question, read below.p

Negative 267 pIve implemented a .Net version of a legacy Basic language using IL assembler. Its working just fine. However, theres an issue of how to provide a better debugging experience for the implementation of GOSUB statement in Visual Studio IDE. The GOSUB statement, common in Basic languages, is implemented as a branch into a section of code and a branch back. The issue is that both step into F10 and step over F11 behave the same  both go into the GOSUB section. What is desired is that F10 step over the GOSUB statement while F11 goes in current behavior.p  pWhat can I do to implement step over when user hits F10 Is there some attribute that I can take advantage ofp

Negative 267 pI created a script to walk over my directory and move my music files to my music folder while renaming the files using the regular expression library to check if the files are numbered as I find this to be an annoyance. The script seems to be working fine, as I havent encountered any errors, but was wondering if there was a cleaner way to do this as this seems a bit convoluted and unpythonic. Striving to write cleaner code. By cleaner Im not asking anyone to rewrite my entire code blocks, but rather the checknames function and its implementation when moving files. If there are other errors those would be helpful to be pointed out for the below reason.p  pIf this is terrible code I apologize for any python sins I may have committed as I have only used the os and regular expression modules a few times before.p  pSince i am learning how to use these and have little exposure at this point, an explanation of why would go a long way to aid in my understanding. All the codeos.path.join....code was my attempt at making it crossplatform and not having to hardcode paths.

Negative 267 pIm working on a project and Im stumped. I have 2 websites that take orders. The databases are on the same server. Each website stores the order data into tables in separate databases. The primary site uses dbo.Orders, which is the  table that is used to give data to our aspdotnetstorefront backend. Our sales people use this interface to review orders. The secondary site usesdbo.orders, which is the table used to store orders. The second sites orders are not accessible on the aspdotnetstorefront. My job is to merge the orders from the secondary site into the table for the primary site so the orders can be seen on the aspdotnetstorefront backend like the orders from the primary site. I also have to create an identifier so when viewed the sales people will know which site the order was from. I think creating a temporary table and maybe an outer join or merge Problem is the tables have no matching fields. Any suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 267 pI am developing an app with Symfony2 that has 3 main parts called frontoffice, backoffice, admin. I was thinking to create three separate bundles FrontOfficeBundle, BackOfficeBundle, AdminBundle but Symfonys docs says, each bundle should not have any relation with each other. Entity is already a shared property and probably some models. I could create a SharedBundle but it does not make sense. I remember when I created an app 2 years go when I had like 15 bundles and all connected each other and I know from experience that its a nightmare. p  pShould I have just one bundle AppBundle and logic split in the folders, eg. ControllerAdmin ControllerFrontOffice, ControllerBackOfficep  pWhats the best approachp
Negative 267 pEventSourcing works perfectly when we have  particular  unique EntityID but when I am trying to get information from eventStore other than particular EntityId i am having tough time.p  pI am using CQRS with EventSourcing. As part of eventsourcing we are storing the events in SQL table as columnsEntityID uniqueKey,EventType,EventObjecteg. UserAdded.p  pSo while storing EventObject we are just serializing the DotNet object and storing it in SQL, So, All the details related to UserAdded event will be in xml format. My concern is I want to make sure the userName which is present in db Should be unique.p  pstrongSo, while making command of AddUser I have to query EventStoresql db whether the particular userName is already present in eventStore.strong So for doing that I need to serialize all the UserAddedUserEdited events in Event store and check if requested username is present in eventStore.p  pstrongBut as part of CQRS commands are not allowed to query may be because of Race condition.strongp  pemSo, I tried before sending the AddUser command just query the eventStore and get all the UserNames by serializing all eventsUserAdded and fetch usernames and if requested username is unique then shoot command else throwing exception that userName already exist.emp  pAs with above approach ,we need to query entire db and we may have hundreds of thousands of eventsday.So the execution of querydeserialization will take much time which will lead to performance issue.p  pstrongI am looking for any better approachsuggestion for maintaining username Unique either by getting all userNames from eventStore or any other approachstrong    p

That problem is if the child uses void Update as well so the base Update does not get called anymore. Is possible to avoid it. Example restrict access to Update Method if base already defined it Or it is possible to let child use definition of void Update but baseclass should also be able to use his own Update background working Pp  pThe other developer should not use everytime base.Update. I am sure they will forget this many times p

Negative 267 pMy computer recently got shut down abruptly. When I powered it back on, I found out that some of the binary files I had written when the computer was running last time got corrupted.

I was told that in order to save my data without the risk of losing it in case of another abrupt power outage, I should make use of codefsynccode function.
