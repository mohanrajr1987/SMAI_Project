Positive 916 pI know you can get the codefontfamilycode value by codewindow.getComputedStylecode but thats not always exactly the font that is used by a browser to render. For example, if the given text contains the multilingual text the font family does not carry, the browser renders the text partially with the system font.p  pIf you take a look at the builtin web developer tool, either in Chrome or Firefox, they both have a little area to display codeRendered Fontscode pane on Chrome or codeFontscode tab on Firefox the exact fonts that are used. For the Firefox, I guess a hrefhttpsdxr.mozilla.orgmozillacentralsourcedevtoolsclientfontinspectorfontinspector.js relnofollowthis codea is used and it seems to be calling the internal API.p  pIm looking for any DOMcompliant or vendorspecific way to get the exact font from the JavaScript land or else.

Positive 916 pI have a quick question about WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility. p  pWe know that heading should be something like H1  H2  H3 etc. When stepping down through headings, skipping levels should be avoided. That means that an codelth1gtcode is followed by an codelth1gtcode or codelth2gtcode, an codelth2gtcode is followed by a codelth2gtcode or codelth3gtcode etc. p  pHowever, what happens when we use css styles on this headings. p  pFor example, let us assume we have several H3 s on a page. Now let us assume some of these H3 have style fontweight bold. Some of these h3 have style fontweight normal. Some of these h3 have style fontfamily Arial. Some have fontfamily Helvetica etc. Some have these h3 have style fontsize 24px. Some of these h3 have fontsize 20px. Does this sort of styling making H3 looks different slightly on the same page violating the WCAG 2.0 AA accessibilityp  pWhat about usability Does it not violate good practice for usabilityp

Negative 916 pI have been trying to find some resource on this topic for a while now but to no avail so what is the best way to construct a WPF UI for LOB Line of Business applications specifically Customers, Orders, Products, etc.. I have seen many single window WPF application examples that dont need to be anything else but a single window and ive  looked at applications such as FamilyShow which looked promising until all I could see in the code was a big pile of user controls that faded in and out over the lifetime of the application and not something I could really use for lets say a 3040 views in an application.p  pSo what exactly am I asking Well should I build a LOB application as a single WPF window with lets say a panel that has user controls dynamically loaded into it and then swap these out when lets say a navigation item is pressed or should I have multiple window forms that get shown or hidden when lets say a navigation item is pressed from a launching main form.p  pUI Design has never really been my strengh but im keen to learn so I would really appreciate your thoughts and offered experience in laying out your WPF LOB applications WindowUCs or Windows or could point me to any articles that cover WPF UI Layout design for LOB applications.p  pThanks for reading...p  pGeoff.p

Negative 916 pIm implementing a GUI application in Jython, using Eclipse and PyDev plugin.  The problem is that I have a hard time using the builtin debugger.

Negative 916 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a payment page where the user can select from a list of existing payment methods, or specify a new one. The dropdown presents options such as p  ol liVisa  strongememstrong1234 Savedli liMastercard  strongememstrong9876 Savedli li[New Credit Card ...]li li[New Electronic Check ...]li ol  pUsing jQuery, I toggle hidden DIVs that contain either an informational table in the case of options 1 or 2 for saved payment methods or a form in the case of the [new] options.p  pI am using a strongly typed class as my view model which contains among simple types a CreditCard class and a Check class. Each of these classes uses data annotation validators, as they are used in other parts of the site.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pThe problem comes in when the user submits the form. I would like to use model binding to handle the mapping of POST values, but I need the binding andor validation to fire depending on which option the user selected. For example, if the user selects option 1 or 2 from the list above, I dont want the model validation or maybe even the binding itself to fire for the CreditCard or Check objects. p  pI have researched the possibilities of creating a custom model binder using IModelBinder as well as extending the DefaultModelBinder and just overriding some of the methods. However, I am unsure as to which method is better, and, if extending DefaultModelBinder, which would be the appropriate method to override.p  pThe logic would be fairly simplep  ul liIf the user selected one of the existing payment methods, no validation on the CreditCard or Check are required.li liIf the user selected one of the options to create a new payment method, then only the selected method CreditCard or Check needs to be bound and validatedli ul  pIt feels as if extending the DefaultModelBinder is the way to go, as I would like most of the heavy lifting to be done by the framework without the need to create a custom binder from scratch. However, when looking at the available methods to override, its not clear which is the best onesp  ol liBindProperty  The problem here is that I basically need to look at one of the properties to determine what other properties should be bound. I dont think I can control the order in which the incoming properties are bound, and I wouldnt want to rely on the order they are set in the HTML form.li liOnModelUpdated  By this point, its too late. The binding validation from the data annotations has been triggered and the ModelState has been updated. I would have to loop through the ModelState and remove the errors that are not relevant. li liOnPropertyValidating  At first I thought this is where I should look, but even returning TRUE for all properties as a test causes the ModelState to contain binding errors.li ol  pI have come across this scenario in other aspects of the application and decided to split up functionality into separate controlleractions to simplify the process. However, I would like to have a better understanding of how to approach more complex UI problems, particularly related to the MVC model binding features.p  pAny help on this subject would be greatly appreciated.p  pAll the possible values are stored in a dropdown list. Using jQuery, I toggle the form for a new payment method and the display for an existing methodp

Negative 916 pIm currently using conditional mappings in EF4 to filter out any records where their IsActive column is false. This works as intended, but Im running into an issue when navigating relationships.p  pAs an example, I have a onetomany relationship where a Store can have many Inventory records. A Store can be marked IsActive as can the Inventory records that belong to it. Querying directly for records in those tables works as intended only active records are returned, but I am also able to retrieve Inventory records where the associated store is not active. This allows the inactive Store to be accessed and gives me no way of detecting whether the store is active.p  pPrior to switching over to using conditional mapping, we were using queries similar to the followingp  precodeInventories.Wherei gt i.IsActive ampamp i.Store.IsActive ampamp i.Product.IsActive ampamp i.Product.Id  productId codepre  pI was hoping we could simplify that query to thisp  precodeInventories.Wherei gt i.Product.Id  productId codepre  pThis doesnt work for me though, as I no longer have any way of knowing whether the Store or Product are active as I cant use conditional mapping on IsActive while still mapping that column.p  pIs there any way of replicating that query while taking advantage of conditional mapping in EF4 Am I forced to leave conditional mapping out of this and hope that all queries make sure to check all relevant IsActive fieldsp

Negative 916 pI am developing nonstandard application.

These applets are signed and certificates are imported into the keystore.

So there is for example p  precodeltsecuritygt      ltallpermissionsgt ltsecuritygt  codepre  petc. My SWT application, resp. all its jar files are signed the same certificate as was used for applets. It starts fine, it does operations that wouldnt be allowed without all permissions and signing,  it even shows SWT windows thus SWT itself works fine, but when it should show embedded browser I am getting UnsatisfiedLinkException. Funny thing is that when I create .java.policy file with some specific set of permissions, it stars working properly, applets work as well. Playing role of  Sherlock Holmes I figured out that this set of permissions containsp  precode  java.io.FilePermission    java.lang.RuntimePermission   permissions that are neccessary for applets. codepre  pDoes it make sense to anyone of you It looks like swt mozilla browser runs in some sort of specific SecurityManager that ignores the fact that the application itself is signed and also tag           exists in my jnlp file.p  pWhen I load pages without applets, still mentioned two permissions are neccessary to display browser window at all. Id like to run this application without any .java.policy files and without extra settings on users side. I appreciate every single advice. p  pThank you in advance.p  pVojta p

I can only manage to make it work if I pad my string like this codeCI00252code   .  p  pConsidering that most of the fields defined on the database are CHAR, it is impossible for me to pad everything before executing the query.br What can I do to fix this problemp  pPS Ive seen some other people with the same problem here but I couldnt find any appropriate answer.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI was reading a a hrefhttpxmlguy.wordpress.com20080410nhibernatetalesnmappingoracleraw relnofollowbloga and this guy had a similar problem with another datatype.Ive tried to adpapt the code p  precodepublic SqlType[] SqlTypes              get                          SqlType[] types  new SqlType[1]                 types[0]  new SqlTypeDbType.StringFixedLength                 return types                       codepre  pp  pand, apparently, everything is working but ...

Negative 916 pI have a UITableView, with a SearchBar that has a visible ScopeBar. I have implemented all the requisite delegate and data source methods to support table indices. Yet, when the table view is shown, there are no section indices displayed. When the search results table is shown, there are section indicies displayed.p  pI implemented the code snippet from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4287621uitableviewcheckiftheindexisshown42877684287768this answera and confirmed that the main table is, in fact, indexed.p  pI am really stumped. Logging suggests that everything is in place to have this work, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why the main table doesnt show indices. And yes, the indices for the main table are setup I can see them in my logging.p  pFor the main table, I can see that the index titles are requested and returned, but not displayed.p  pFor the search results table, the same logging appears titles are requested and returned, and they ARE displayed.p  pOne thing to note, although I cant see how this would cause the indices in the table not to appear, is that the SearchBar class is actually a subclass that simply overrides codesetShowsScopeBarcode to force it to YES. I tried my app with and without this override. Same result no index in the main table view.p  pSo the question is What would prevent the index from showing, even when all the requisite delegate and data source methods for supporting indices is in place and working at least for the search results table, because the methods are called and the index is shown for that view.p  pThanksp

Negative 916 pI recently switched to Visual Studio 2010 and for Intellisense not to take half a minute to show up when using codeboostcode libraries, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combvcblogarchive20100126precompiledheaderfilesinvisualstudio2010.aspxMicrosofts suggestiona seems to use precompiled headers.p  pExcept that I never used them before except when forced to by Ugly ATL Wizards TM, so I searched around to figure out how they work.p  pBasically, the Big Centralized codestdafx.hcode approach seems plain wrong. I never want to include even cheaply a whole bunch of header files in all my sources. Since I dont use windows libraries I make CCLI higher level wrappers, then use .NET for talking to the outside world, I dont have a whole truckload of nonchanging enormous headers. Just codeboostcode and standard library headers scattered around.p  pThere is a hrefhttpwww.lenholgate.comblog200407fistlportprecompiledheaderswarninglevel4andpragmahdrstop.htmlan interesting approacha to this problem, but I cant quite figure out how to make this work. It seems that each source file must be compiled twice please correct me if Im wrong once with Yc and once with Yu. This adds burden on the developper which must manually tweak the build system.p  pI was hoping to find some automatically generate one precompiled header for each source file trick, or at least some best practices, but most people seem happy with including the world into codestdafx.hcode.p  pstrongWhat are the options available to me to use precompiled headers on a per source file basis strong I dont really care about build times as long as they dont skyrocket, I just want intellisense to work strongfaststrong.p

Negative 916 pI work with a lot of monochrome image data and this morning I noticed that there appears to be a significant difference between the way libjpeg and the .Net jpeg codec handle monochrome data. It appears that a monochrome image saved at ANY quality setting using libjpeg and opened using the default .Net jpeg codec actually only loads with 16 different shades of gray and all intermediate shades are rendered as stippled. p  pHere is the histogram of a smooth gradient saved by libjpeg and loaded by .netp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOz6Gj.png altHistogram of codec conflict affected gradientp  pThe histogram should have been perfectly level.p  pAnd here is a zoomed in sample of what that gradient looks like it should a be perfectly smooth transition img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC6bz7.png altenter image description herep  pThis should be a smooth transition from gray 85 on the left to gray 136 on the right but only 4 shades of gray are actually rendered to make that transition.p  pMy question is am I crazy and if not just how far does this codec discrepancy go Is there a good workaround if you are using both libraries in different programsp  pI am not blaming either codec, just pointing out what appears to be a discrepancy. I noticed this with images I knew were created using libjpeg, assumed it was a quality setting issue, tried using faststone image resizer to create test images and got the same result, tried using irfanview and got the same result again. As both of those programs must use some jpeg library I tend to assume they are also using libjpeg and there is a genuine codec conflict.p  pOn the loading side I have run into the same result loading images with both my own .net code and using Paint.net.p  pFinally, here is a sample at normal resolution so you can download it and try it yourself. Loading it in some programs will give you a nice gradient e.g. your browser but loading it with your own .Net code, or Paint.Net will give you a dithered gradient like the above rendered using only 16 shades of gray.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1kSAZ.jpg altenter image description herep  pDoes anyone know more about this, how far it goes and what good workarounds might bep

This is a CC keyword, and not available to me in Delphi.li liUsing InterlockExchange and InterlockCompareExchange.  This is something I could do in Delphi if I had to.

Does this mean that any writes to memory that are limited to functions that use critical sections are immune from cache consistency and memory ordering issues  I have nothing against the Interlock functions, but another tool in my tool belt would be good to havep

Negative 916 pI have different classes all arranged in a hierarchy. To reduce the amount of code, I started creating template functions.  The base class will use the template functions and some of the derived classes will also use the same functions.  Where am I suppose to put all of these templates so I dont get undefined reference issues like I have been  Should I put all the definitions in a header file and then just include that header files in the .cpp part of the class that call the functions. will that work As of right now, all of my classesclass.cpp, class.h compile fine, but everything blows up during the linking.  I tried to put all the templates in a namespace and then include that namespace in the implementation of all my classes but that doesnt seem to work.  My question is, how would you go about making a separate entity that just holds templated functions that any class can use on its data membersp

Even if each SearchResult item is just a tiny 3KB the amount of memory to execute these searches will grow with time and become a huge memory hog. My shared host is only guaranteeing 1GB of dedicated memory so this is a big concern for my website.p  pSo the question is How do i limit the results of the results in a paged manner using lucene query language alone I looked at the apache lucene project, which lucene.net is ported from, and I dont see any syntax that lets me do what Im looking for. Basically I want the equivalent of what sql server has to limit the rows at the query language level.p  pE.g. this is how we would do paging in sql and it only returns 20 records not every record that matches the where clausep  pSelect  from select RowNumber OVER ORDER BY OrderDate as RoNum, OrderID, OrderDate FROM SalesOrders WHERE OrderCustomerName like Davis O WHERE RowNum BETWEEN 1 and 20p
Negative 916 pI am wondering if Plone 4 has an API. I dont see one documented on api.plone.org. p  pEssentially what I would like to do is pipe content to a Plone page. We have a number of lookup tables in MySQL which if their content could be ported to Plone would allow the content to be found and indexed in Plone. These tables are updated about four times a year so each time it is piped it would become a new version of the same document.p

Negative 916 pI love when the Eclipse debugger halts the process and expands the Package Explorer to highlight the line in my source code when I cause a null pointer exception or other error, but I hate it when it attempts to do that for exceptions occurring within libraries for which I do not have linked source. In those cases it opens the Package Explorer deeply to that point often deep within Android 2.1 SDK. This causes me to have to close the tree back up, and it shows an unhelpful tab for the corresponding class file that I also must close. Is it possible to retain the useful behavior only for exceptions happening in available source filesp

Negative 916 pAn application has three clients desktop, iOS, Android, based on Ember.js. The desktop client is a mixture of ember and Rails views. The phone apps are wrapped in Phonegap. The serverside is a Rails app using the asset pipeline.p  pThere is some shared code between the three clients.

Negative 916 pSorry if this is a noob question, but I get tripped up on some simple things as Im starting to learn to program.  If I use a NSDateFormatter in one of my ViewControllers to display the date I want in a certain format, and the format doesnt change, is it best practices to declare that NSDateFormatter as an ivar of my class or property of my class and initialize it in the viewDidLoad so I can reuse it in my different methods  Right now I just instantiate one whenever I need it in a method that deals with the display and was wondering if its better to just keep declaring it, or declare it once and just use it throughout the viewController class.  thanksp

Negative 916 pI have a DataGrid with cells that can be edited. When the row loses focus the property changed event fires and I handle that by committing the changes to an entity object and eventually to the database. The user can rightclick outside of the datagrid and select from a context menu. Some of the context menu items are dependent on the data in the datagrid to be precise they are dependent on the committed data. However, the problem is that a rightclick outside the DataGrid does not remove the focus from the DataGrid. This means the changes to the current row are not committed. This means the user gets surprised because the menu item commands works on data that are different from what is shown on the screen. I realize that this is how the DataGrid works. However, I also realize the the users will never be able to understand this.p  pSo how can I solve this Can I force a lost focus when rightclicking Or is there some special property on the DataGrid I can usep  pI found this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6246452wpfdatagridcelleditendingdatasetnotupdatingtillrowlostfocusWPF DataGrid CellEditEnding  DataSet Not Updating Till Row Lost Focusa which makes the DataGrid commit on a percell basis instead of a perrow basis, but it does not solve my problem, since the user still can lose some data although just one cell instead of a whole rowp

Negative 916 pI am currently working on a script that runs through a document, pulls out all keywords, and then attempts to match these keywords with those found in other documents. There are some specifics that complicate this, but they are not very pertinent to me question. Basically I would like to be able to match words regardless of the tense in which they appear. p  pFor example If given the strings swim, swam, and swimming, I would like a program that can recognize that these are all the same word, though whether it would store the word as swim, swam or swimming doesnt matter all that much to me.p  pIm aware that this problem could be mostly solved with a dictionary containing all of these word forms, but I am unaware of any dictionary that is mapped in such a way to be useful for this. I would prefer a solution or library that is compatible with Python, since that is what I am currently using for this scripting, but I would be fine with a solution in just about any language save haskell or eiffel or something similarly obscuredifficult to work withp
Negative 916 pIve got a CSV file that Id like to convert into a different format.

Negative 916 pI have a project in which i calculate various data on accounts and save each data in a different file each calculation have a different script. Then, i need to create the final file which combine all the data for an account. one way to do that is to save each output in a different directory and than in the final script load each directory with a schema, join or cogroup by account and print. The problem here, is that i need to tell pig which directories to load. I wanted to make a more generic script so it will be easy to add more calculations, so i created a parent directory and saving all the outputs under that in subdirectories. then i wrote this scriptp  precodeattributesdata        load attributesdata using CSVLoader uniondata         group attributesdata by TRIM 0 finaloutput       foreach uniondata generate             FLATTENMergeBagsattributesdata store orderdata into finalattr using AttributesStorer codepre  pthis way, i dont need to tell pig which files he should load, it just load all subdirectories under my output directory. the problem here, is that the order of tuples in the bag after the group by is not consistent, so my final result have no consistent order, which is a problem.p  pIll really apreciate your ideas to make the script generic as possible, while saving some order of data in the final result.p  pThanksp

Negative 916 pI am using RestKit 0.10.1 with Core Data on an iOS 5.0 deployment target to build an app that interfaces with a custom RESTFul API. Since offline connectivity is important, I am maintaining a cache of the users data in a local CoreData database on the device. p  pNow, RestKit is pretty awesome and it has been rather effortless to setup a RKFetchResultsTableController to easily display and persist my data. However, there is one behavior of RestKit which doesnt seem ideal and which I cant figure out how to change. p  pI have a model called Recording. To create a new Recording, I am doing the following p  precode Recording r  [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForNameRecording inManagedObjectContext[[RKObjectManager sharedManager].objectStore managedObjectContextForCurrentThread]]   r.name  newName   [[RKObjectManager sharedManager] sendObjectr toResourcePathrecordings usingBlockRKObjectLoader loader         loader.delegate  self          loader.method  RKRequestMethodPOST         loader.serializationMIMEType  RKMIMETypeJSON            loader.serializationMapping  [RKObjectMapping serializationMappingUsingBlockRKObjectMapping serializationMapping             [serializationMapping mapAttributesname, nil]          ]          RBMappingProvider mappings  RBMappingProvider [[RKObjectManager sharedManager] mappingProvider]         loader.objectMapping  [mappings recordingObjectMapping]      ] codepre  pThis creates a new entity of type Recording and then sends the entity to the server in a POST request.

What I find in these situations is that there is already a local copy of the entity in the Core Data database with an id of 0 the id is the primary key which is set by the server. p  pThe only way to remove the local entity is to force a refresh of the local data from the server. p  pIs there a way to persist the object locally only once the server responds with a 2xx Alternately, is there a way to undo the changes if the server responds with anything but a 2xx p  pThanks,p

Negative 916 pI have been looking over a couple of classes I have in an android project, and I realized that I have been mixing logic with data. Having realized how bad this can be to the readability and the testability of my project, I decided to do some refactoring in order to abstract away all services logic to separate services modules. However, since I have been relying on Javas polymorphism, I got lost and need some guidance. p  pSuppose I have this tobechanged layout for a super data class, and two subclassesp  precodepublic class DataItem       some variables        public saveToDB Some Arguments            do some stuff            public render           render the class         public class ChildDataItemA extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemA            Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemA         public class ChildDataItemB extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemB            Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemB        codepre  pNow, I thought about moving the codesaveToDBcode and coderendercode methods to a service class. However, sometimes I need to be able to call these method into instance of compiled type codeDataItemcode without knowing its runtime type. For instance, I might want to make the following callp  precodeListltDataItemgt dataList  for DataItem item dataList      item.saveToDB     item.render  codepre  pAdditionally, I thought of doing the followingp  precodepublic class ChildDataItemB extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemB           Service.saveToDBB           Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemB          Service.renderB       codepre  pWhere I still keep dummy methods in each subclass that would call an appropriate service method. However, I do not think that this really achieves the separation I want since data classes will still know about services bad. p  pAny ideas on how to solve thisp  pEdit Note that coderendercode and codesaveToDBcode are just generic examples of what these methods can be, so the problem is not really about choosing an ORM or SQL related techniques.p

Negative 916 pI want to make a QTreeView that shows some data that I get with sqlalchemy. There are about 100010.000 rows to show. I thought that a using a model would be better to use here than the simpler QTreeWidget, because I thought it would be relatively easy to connect the model to sqlalchemy, because I assumed that this is something that is done quite often. Apparently it is not... I am unable to find good examples of this.p  pI looked at the documentation of QStandardItemModel, and as I understood it, I have to create a QStandardItem for every value. With thousands of rows times nine columns, I think that this is going to be terribly slow.br I have worked with a hrefhttpobjectlistview.sourceforge.netpython relnofollowObjectListViewa in wxpython before and hoped the treeview in Qt would work similar, so you can imagine my disappointment when I found how complex this was going to be P.p  pSo my questionsp  ol liIs there a way to connect sqlalchemy to the QTreeViewli liHow can I use the items that are returned by sqlaclhemy in my treeview like done by ObjectListViewli ol  pAs you can see I am very new to models and views and Qt, so any answer, explanation, link, usefull hint or whatsever that has something to say about this is very welcomep

Negative 916 pThere are a bunch of launch daemons and agents running on an osx machine which support xpc.  To see whether they support IPC over xpc, I look for any xpc functions, particularly xpcconnectioncreate.  My understanding is that in order to speak with these processes, a dictionary has to be made through the xpc api which is then passed to the advertised com. service.  Instead of passing in random stuff, is there any way to see what the arguments of the dictionary should be per processp  pIf I have any of the above logic wrong, please feel free to correct it.  Any advice or comment is helpful, thanks.p

On most modern 32bit Windows systems the maximum heap size will range from 1.4G to 1.6G. On 32bit Solaris kernels the address space is limited to 2G. On 64bit operating systems running the 32bit VM, the max heap size can be higher, approaching 4G on many Solaris systems. As of Java SE 6, the Windows 3GB boot.ini feature is not supported. If your application requires a very large heap you should use a 64bit VM on a version of the operating system that supports 64bit applications. See Java SE Supported System Configurations for details.p  pOk.Now lets strongassumestrong my 32 bit server can take 3.2 GB.As i know p  blockquote precodeXmx is the total heap memory XXNewSize  XXMaxNewSize is the range of the size of the new generation inside that heap the difference is the range of the size of the old generation XXPermSize  XXMaxPermSize is the range of the size of the permanent generation, which is the nonheap memory codepre blockquote  pAccording to this, 3.2 GB should not include PermSize as this is a not a heap content.Right p  pLet me know if am wrong.p  pI can divide 3.2 GB in Xmx and NewSize .

Negative 916 pSo Im learning VB.NET and I kinda have this newbie question and I couldnt find answers anywhere on the web.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhpYdB.jpg altThe programp  pThis program is supposed to be counter. Every time the button is clicked the label should update. Heres my code for the MouseClick Listener every time the button is clickedp  precodeSub Button2MouseClicksender As Object, e As MouseEventArgs     Dim starter As String     Dim int1 As Integer      Dim int2 As Integer      Dim ender As String     starter label2.Text     int1  CIntstarter     int2  int1  1     ender  CStrint2     label2.Text  ender End Sub codepre  pThe program works but heres the problem. It only works up until number 9. Once it is supposed to display 10 is just displays 1 and when it is supposed to display 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, it only displays 1 the first digit.p
Negative 916 pI have the following scriptp  precodebinbash         PATH... echo Syncing database dumps rsync ssh userXX.XXX.XXX.XXtest test echo Creating symlink ln s test tmptest codepre  pOnly the first command and all echos are run. If I comment out the first command, then the symlink command is runp  precodebinbash         PATH... echo Syncing database dumps rsync ssh userXX.XXX.XXX.XXtest test echo Creating symlink ln s test tmptest codepre  pThe rest do not run. Any ideas whyp  pEdit, based on recent comment, added the v option to the symlink command. Now I can see that all the commands do run. But they do not run in the sequential order they are set in. The symlink command will run BEFORE the rsync command has finished. How can I set the order so the symlink command is only run after the rsync command has finishedp
Negative 916 pI have read many questions and tutorials about this, I couldnt find a case similar to mine.p  pI have an index view which has a search form inside to filter results available in my database.p  pHeres the simplified version my controller action for my index viewp  precode[HttpPost]     public ActionResult IndexString carMake, String carModel              var cars  from d in db.Cars                     select d          if String.IsNullOrEmptycarMake                      if carMake.EqualsAll Makes                              cars  cars.Wherex gt x.Make  carMake                                if String.IsNullOrEmptycarModel                      if carModel.EqualsAll Models                              cars  cars.Wherex gt x.Model  carModel                                cars  cars.OrderByx gt x.Make         return ViewSearchResult, cars      codepre  pas you can see, I get the data from Index view and post it to my SearchResult view directly without the use of any codepublic ActionResult SearchResult...code. But I do have codepublic ActionResult SearchResult...code method in my controller.p  pNow, Im trying to sort my results. How can I do thatp  pI have tried many different ways to pass data from my Index method to Search Result method such as TempData and so on. But the problem with them is when I click on the sort button the page reloads and the Query that I have taken from my Index view form will be all null because TempData is only useful for passing data among methods and when the method is recalled, the data will be gone and all null.p  pI have some solutions in my mind but Im not sure if they will work out and if theyre the besteasiest solution possible to come up with. Which is recording the Query I get from my Index page into a table I dont think would be a wise thing to do tho.p

In my localhost, the progress indication was in light green color Chrome amp Firefox, and then I uploaded these files to my server. Now here comes the problem. p  pUsually, I never use such direct source for linking the scripts, I copy the script, put it in my js directory and work so that even in future if the uploader deletes it, my site functionality wont stop. So, I took a saved that js file and uploaded here  a hrefhttpankursinha.netTestSitebootstrapjsjqupload.js relnofollowA copy of the JS file in my sitea. But the script stops working, no progress is shown while uploading. I have a strange feeling may be there are some API or some other things in that JS file connected to the uploaders github account or something. I want to know why this happens and what to do when such things happen. p  pAnother problem is, after uploading it to my server, the progress bar color changed to blue by itself may be because of bootstrap, my strange feeling, but when I used inline styling and put the color as black, it still came blue. p  pSo what I want is, how to get the script work with the one which is there on my server and how to change the upload progress bar color from blue to black.p  pHere is the link to my site a hrefhttpankursinha.netTestSitefileshareuploadfile.php relnofollowFile Upload With Progress Bara Please do not upload files larger than 3 MB, images, zip, rar, and office files alone supportedp  pThank Youp

Negative 916 pIm building a webphonegap application for an older version of Android 2.3.x. Everything works great up until I try to add any server redirection into the mix. Heres the scenariop  pThe server node.js has a route listening at . When this route is hit, it checks to see if the there is a session or not. If there is no session, it redirects to login. Fine, this part works server wise, anyways. p  pThe problem arises when the client gets the redirect. Because Android 2.3 doesnt support history.pushState, it falls back to hashbangs. This means AngularJS rewrites the url to login, which causes a server request to , which causes the server to check session and redirect to login, which causes AngularJS to rewrite the url to login.. and so on and so forth.. indefinitely. p  pAny ideas how I can redirect from the server with AngularJS Should I not be handling this logic in my route but instead try to implement it on the client There has to be a way to handle this, Im sure, but I just cant seem to figure it out.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 916 pIve got a div container that has some fixed size pre and post content, with the main content sandwiched in the middle  the main content basically consists of a label and a number.

This also manages the minimum size of the content div so that shrinking further will ellipseout the number as well.  p  pThe problem Im having is in trying to make this work strongwithoutstrong Javascript  having codemaxwidthcode constantly changing for all the elements is rather cludgyslow the sample only shows two items, but in production this is in a list of many items, and it makes the structure less portable for using as subcomponents of other widgets.  I can refactor it to work, but thatll take some time, and it seems the more correct solution is to just use CSS where possible.p  pThe closest I got to simulating this was to set codemaxwidthcode for codemembertextcode to 100 and codemaxwidthcode for codemembertokencode to around 85, which looks good for the outerDiv width range around the default 230290ish, but beyond that it breaks down too muchlittle spacing in the wrong parts.p  pstrongEditstrong Ive also now tried divs with codedisplay tablecode and codetablerowcodecodetablecellcode, with codetablelayout fixedcode on the root div  by specifying a width on all but one column, that column can be dynamically sized.  This would be useful if there was only one div that had variable sized content the text, but in this case, there are two the bubble text, represented by a number in the mockups, but this strategy doesnt seem to allow multiple dynamically sized columns.p  pstrongWhich leads to my questions  is it even possible to do this sort of thing with just CSS And if so, howstrong  Even assuming the number is a fixed width to simplify the issue, this doesnt seem possible without Javascript...p  pHeres the code sample simplified example to demo the issuep  pstrongHTMLstrong p  precodeltdiv classouterDivgt   ltdiv classpostmarkgtltdivgt   ltdiv classpremarkgtltdivgt   ltdiv classmembergt         ltdiv classmembertokengt             ltlabel classmembertextgtVery Long Text Purple Monkey Dishwasherltlabelgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classmemberbubblegt             ltspan classmemberbubbletextgt500ltspangt         ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classouterDivgt   ltdiv classpostmarkgtltdivgt   ltdiv classpremarkgtltdivgt   ltdiv classmembergt         ltdiv classmembertokengt             ltlabel classmembertextgtPurple Monkey Dishwasherltlabelgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classmemberbubblegt             ltspan classmemberbubbletextgt500ltspangt         ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrong p  precode.outerDiv        width 280px       height 100px       backgroundcolor lightgrey       .postmark        display inlineblock       height 100       marginright 8px       position relative       width 18px       float right       backgroundcolor cyan       .premark        height 100       marginleft 4px       position relative       width 18px       float left       backgroundcolor pink       .member        marginleft 22px       height 22px       overflow hidden       position relative       whitespace nowrap       backgroundcolor cadetblue       .membertoken        float left       height 20px       marginleft 2px       padding 0 3px       backgroundcolor darksalmon       .membertext        display inlineblock       lineheight 20px       maxwidth 193px       overflow hidden       textoverflow ellipsis       whitespace nowrap       backgroundcolor goldenrod       .memberbubble        display block       height 100       overflow hidden       padding 0 4px       position relative       backgroundcolor burlywood       .memberbubbletext        top 4px       mozboxsizing borderbox       backgroundcolor F2F2F2       borderradius 3px 3px 3px 3px       display inlineblock       lineheight 14px       maxwidth 100       padding 0 4px       position relative       verticalalign top       color 666666       fontsize 11px       fontweight bold       overflow hidden       textoverflow ellipsis       whitespace nowrap    codepre

Negative 916 pIm developing android app and use codeSignalRcode on my codeasp.netcode server and a custom java client a hrefhttpsgithub.comerizetSignalA relnofollowSignalAa.

ContinueWitht gt Groups.SendgroupId, message codepre  pOn the client side I receive callback with a new groups token, but the first sent message isnt received messages sent afterwards are however received. Trying the same thing with the official C client works perfectly. So it seems like the first message is received before a new groups token is processed.p  pAfter long try comparing C and java client code I havent found the solution. Im looking for an explanation or code references on how this situation is handled in C client so Id be able to implement the same logic in java client.p  pP.S. itd be much more painless if theres a way to use official C client with android instead of using custom java client.p  pP.P.S. there are some dirty ways to fix my issue, like putting a small delay on server after joining the group or sending confirmation message from client, but still Im looking for a clean fix.p

Negative 916 pI have two versions of my custom software. The ModernMetro app AppM and my legacy Desktop application AppD.  I have created a custom protocol for AppM using the manifest that is well understood.  Ive edited the registry to make a custom protocol handler for AppD and have tested that I can indeed launch AppD using protocol activation from the Run dialog WINR by supplying the protocol and hitting enter, AppD in this case.  Id like to be able to launch AppM from AppD and AppD from AppM.  Ive added handlers for each. In AppD Im using Process.Starturi and in AppM Im using Launcher.LaunchUriAsyncuri.  I can get AppM to launch from AppD but I never get AppD to launch from AppM.  Ive googled and cant find any references to this.  Im assuming its not possible and might very much have to do with permissions.  As this assignment has fallen to me on the project, I need to either prove that its not possible or find a solution.p  pIve tested this out using CXAml as well as HTMLJS and its interesting to find that Launcher.LaunchUriAsyncuri.when success function is called, but the success flag is false.  there is no error or at least the err function is never hit.  Id like to get a better error message and Im currently trying to dig down that way.p  pSo help with the actual issue, or help with how to debug this would both be greatly appreciated.p  pUpdate To eliminate my own code, I downloaded and installed the a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsappsAssociationLaunching535d2cec relnofollowlaunch by association examplea and simply changed the emvar uriToLaunch a hrefhttpbing.com relnofollowhttpbing.comaem to emvar uriToLaunch AppDem and it fails every time.  This protocol is associated in the registry and the method that Im using to verify this is by running it using WINR from the desktop and the app launches just fine.p

The structure is something like thisp  precode  ID      Year1               Year2       1       2001               2           2       2001               1           3       1999               3           4       2004               2           codepre  pId like to reorder the physical structure of the whole table by changing the codeautoincrementcode ID to match the codeYear1code and codeYear2code columns when ordered in ascending order. Something like this..p  precode  ID      Year1               Year2       1       1999               3           2       2001               1           3       2001               2           4       2004               2           codepre  pIs this possible with a query in MySQL or should I use PHP and loops, et al.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The use case is this The actual data I have is stored in a specific pattern.

Negative 916 pWhat I understand There is what is called a frame buffer. It is an array of pointers to buffer objects. The buffer objects can be for example render buffers, texture buffers or other. If I want to draw something I attach a render buffer to the frame buffer, draw into it and finally call a method to send it to the screen.p  p1 Is this correct so farp  pWhat I dont understandp  p2 I think I read somewhere that the frame buffer is created when the context is created. Alas, I cannot find anymore where I saw this. But if the frame buffer really gets created why do I have to call codeglGenFramebuffersOES1, ampframebuffercode and codeglBindFramebufferOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES, framebuffercode As I understand it the first one creates a new frame buffer with one space for an attachment and the second line sets the contexts frame buffer pointer to codeframebuffercode. But assuming I already have a frame buffer in the context why cant I retrieve that and attach my render buffer to that insteadp  p3 What is the default frame buffer It is a frame buffer with name 0. If there is already a default frame buffer, why do I have to create a new one if I want to drawp
Negative 916 pI have solved a weird issue, and I would like to know why it happens.p  pMy application creates screens with FrameLayout as the root element. For Simplicity, lets say I have a Framelayout with some scrolling elements inside, for example a ScrollView with a TextView, and a GridView.p  pThese child elements are positioned with LayoutParams so I assign them a Width, a Height, and a Margin Left  Margin Top. The usual case is their sizes do NOT match the parent, that is, they are floating inside the parent FrameLayout.p  pFor nonscrolling elements, everything is cool.p  pBut for scrolling elements, when scrolling, I can see all kinds of leftovers OUTSIDE the child bounds. Inside the bounds the scrolling is perfect, but the elements are not clipped properly.p  pI did a lot of tests, played with setClipChildren  setClipToBounds, changed the root element from FrameLayout to RelativeLayout, etc etc, without success.p  pI only succeeded when I wrapped the scrolling elements inside another FramelayoutRelativeLayout without any margins, and then assigned the scrolling elements MATCHPARENTMATCH PARENT.p  pThe scroll is perfect now, clipping is properly done, but I have added another level of complexity to the layout.p  pWhy does this happenp

I echoed an alert right before the INSERT function and it only sends one alert when the page loads so it seems as though its running through the code only once. I removed the form code thinking that maybe the Javascript autoredirect may have been causing some loop of the code but I got the same results. I also removed the SELECT query that comes right after the INSERT query thinking that it maybe causing the duplicate but that didnt do the trick either.p  pIm using the SELECT query in order to concatenate a GET variable on the end of success and cancel URLs for the PayPal form.p  pIm out of ideas on why it would be looping through twice.

This issue was slow to surface, and did not result   in any serious impact to our users before our existing monitoring   caught the error. To address this issue, we rolled out an alternative   method for memory accounting on May 7th. This alternate method   overestimated the amount of memory currently in use, and our   schedulers slowly started accumulating incorrect values for memory   usage. p      pThe overestimation caused the App Engine scheduler to erroneously   assume that our infrastructure was under constant memory pressure,   which in turn resulted in overaggressive termination of instances,   which was visible as error code 121 in an affected applications   logs. Upon aggregating user reports of the issue on the morning of May   8th, our reliability team determined the source of the erroneous   calculations, and rolled out a new fix which corrected the memory   usage overestimation, and halted the unnecessary terminations.p      pWe do not consider the time to repair an issue at this level of impact   acceptable. We are adding new alerts and tools for memory accounting   to prevent recurrence of similar issues in the future and to decrease   our response time. Application code or Admin Console settings did not   influence whether your application was affected by this issue, and no   changes to your code or settings are needed.p      pWe appreciate your patience during this issue and apologize for any   inconvenience this caused you or your customers. If you feel that your   paid application experienced an SLA violation, please fill out this   form.p      pRegards, Christina Ilvento on behalf of the Google App Engine Teamp blockquote  pIf anyone has an idea, or news that would be a great thing ...

Negative 916 pI am currently developing my own kernel to use for classification and want to include it into libsvm, replacing the standard kernels that libsvm offers.p  pI however am not 100 sure how to do this, and obviously do not want to make any mistakes. Beware, that my c is not very good. I found the following on the libsvm faqpagep  blockquote   pQ I would like to use my own kernel. Any example In svm.cpp, there   are two subroutines for kernel evaluations kfunction and   kernelfunction. Which one should I modify   An example is LIBSVM   for string data in LIBSVM Tools.p      pThe reason why we have two functions is as follows. For the RBF kernel   expg xi  xj2, if we calculate xi  xj first and then the norm   square, there are 3n operations. Thus we consider expg xi2    2dotxi,xj xj2 and by calculating all xi2 in the beginning,   the number of operations is reduced to 2n. This is for the training.   For prediction we cannot do this so a regular subroutine using that 3n   operations is needed. The easiest way to have your own kernel is to   put the same code in these two subroutines by replacing any kernel.p blockquote  pHence, I was trying to find the two subroutinges kfunction and kernelfunction. The former I found with the following signature in svm.cppp  precodedouble Kernelkfunctionconst svmnode x, const svmnode y,               const svmparameteramp param codepre  pAm I correct, that x and y each store one observation row of my feature matrix in an array and I need to return the kernel value kx,yp  pThe function kernelfunction on the other hand I was not able to find at all. There is a pointer in the Kernel class with that name and the following declarationp  precodedouble Kernelkernelfunctionint i, int j const  codepre  pwhich is set in the Kernel constructor. What are i and j in that case I suppose I need to set this pointer as wellp  pOnce I overwrote Kernelkfunction and Kernelkernelfunction Id be finished, and libsvm would use my kernel to compare two observationsp  pThank youp

As obviously typing the code for all your different screens into this single class would get very messy very quickly so I created the below class to handle changesp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading  namespace Colonies      public class GameManager manages game screens              Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game currentScreen          public enum screens  menu, game, summary           public GameManager                      initialize                   public void initialize                      currentScreen  new Menuthis             MenucurrentScreen.Run                   public void changeScreenint i                       switch i                              case 0                     currentScreen  new Menuthis                     MenucurrentScreen.Run                     break                 case 1                     currentScreen  new Worldthis                     WorldcurrentScreen.Run                     break                 case 2                     currentScreen  new Summarythis                     SummarycurrentScreen.Run                     break                        codepre  pp  pHowever when one of these changes is triggered this causes an error flag up telling me I cant call game run more than once. Does this mean by initial estimation about having a single all purpose game screen is actually correct Should be manager instead be being queried for game like screens which methods are then called in the main game.cs classp  pi.e.p  pin game.cs update method for examplep  precodeprotected override void UpdateGameTime gameTime       Allows the game to exit     if GamePad.GetStatePlayerIndex.One.Buttons.Back  ButtonState.Pressed         this.Exit       TODO Add your update logic here     aGameManager.getAGameObject.DoAnUpdate     base.UpdategameTime  codepre  pSo essentially my main game class is never run again but just changes what it displays. Would this be the correct solution So much of the game class is hidden I am not sure what is the correct way to use itp
Negative 916 pI want to display a scale on a mapView.  I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5270485convertspanvalueintometersonamapviewthisa thread, from which I added the following code to my mapViewController.mp  precode voidmapViewMKMapView map regionDidChangeAnimatedBOOLanimated  MKCoordinateSpan span  mapView.region.span NSLog 1  111 km gt f   f km ,span.latitudeDelta,span.latitudeDelta111   codepre  pThe above code logs the distance in kilometers from the top of the region of the map displayed in the mapview to the bottom and it updates whenever that distance changes.  The next logical step would be to display that information from my NSLog into a UILabel.  I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12359259xcodewritenslogresultinuilabel1235929312359293thisa thread on just that, but it is not working for me.  To be clear, I get an error saying that string is not defined when I try to enter that code into either my viewDidLoad or my abovementioned regionDidChangeAnimated method.  I also tried the method explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12556046displaynslogresultinuilabelxcodeherea, and I got the same result plus something saying that  was unexpected.  p  pWhat I want to know is how to display my NSLog output in a UILabel.  Once I have that figured out, I plan to add an inchlong bar to the side of the screen just a picture of a line that is one inch long and divide that NSLog output by the number of inches from the top to the bottom of the mapView.  Then I will display the number of km in a UILabel next to that line, so that it will look similar to scales found on traditional maps. I will also have to edit the UILabel to only say the number of kilometers, as the NSLog writes out a lot of contextual information too e.g., 20130711 150220.775 Controller 2.0[1076907]  1  111 km  15.994178   1775.353763 km .  p  pController 2.0 is the name of my app to avoid confusion RE the NSLogp  pThank youp  pEDIT per KHansenSFs advice, I tried to add a string.  Nothing changed.  Here is what I did in the interface on the .h, I wrote p  precodeIBOutlet UILabel scaleLabel NSString latDistance codepre  pThen  after the  I wrotep  precodeproperty weak, nonatomic IBOutlet MKMapView mapView property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UILabel scaleLabel property nonatomic, retain NSString latDistance  IBAction getLatDistance codepre  pThen in the .m I synthesized everything and wrote p  precodescaleLabel.text  latDistance codepre  pIn the viewDidLoad and p  precode IBAction getLatDistance  MKCoordinateSpan span  mapView.region.span NSString latDistance  [NSString stringWithFormat 1  111 km gt f   f km ,span.latitudeDelta,span.latitudeDelta111]  codepre  pafter the viewDidLoad.  Nothing changed.  I must be declaring something incorrectly or passing the information incorrectly but regardless I am stymied.  Any input is appreciated. p  pNOTE I just found a hrefhttpsgithub.comlkxfmapscale relnofollowthisa extension for adding a scale to a MapView on GitHub but the page has no directions and the ReadMe is empty.  Anyone know how to implement this  Alternatively, I found a hrefhttpscode.google.compj2objc relnofollowthisa thread on how to make such a scale on Android.  Possibly such a file could be ported to iOS, for example with a tool like this.  I will investigate this further but any input is appreciated. Thanksp  pEDIT Now that I am done, here is a screenshot of the finished product.  I blurred out the contents of the map annotation and the company name in the header for privacy purposes.  It works beautifullybr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comspqLI.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 916 pI am trying to capture Printer.Canvas as a Bitmap using BitBlt. I want to then take that Bitmap and display it on a paintbox.

I am doing this because if I understand it correctly I should be only be drawing between the printer canvass TopLeft 0,0 and BottomRight 300,300 the same way I would on my paint box.

Something like the following examplep  blockquote   p1  Is John Matrix cooler than John Rambop      prarr Yesp      pnbspnbspnbspnbsp Nop      pnbspp      p2  Is Commando the best movie everp      pnbspnbspnbspnbspYesp      prarr Nop      pWhy not strongememememememememememememememememememememstrong  requiredp blockquote  pSo, if someone would say No, the Why not field appearsp  precodeif nocommandofield.ischecked      whynotfield.show  else      whynotfield.hide  codepre  pnbspp  pstrongProblemstrongp  pMy problem is that the Why not field is required, even if someone selects the Yes option like its supposed to. I would like to make this field required only if the previous answer is No.p  pstrongQuest to solve problemstrongp  pWhile exploring the code Im not a backend specialist I realized that the Inline Form Validation Engine adds a class to the required fields, called validate[required]. I tried deleting that class using jQuery, but the validation still occurs.p  precodevar validate validate  whynotfield.attrclass validate  validate.replacevalidate[required],notvalidated whynotfield.attrclass,validate  if  nocommandofield.ischecked      validate  validate.replacenotvalidated,validate[required]     whynotfield.attrclass,validate  else      validate  validate.replacevalidate[required],notvalidated     whynotfield.attrclass,validate  codepre  pThe class swap is working perfectly, but somehow the validation is still occurring. Although this solution worked for me on previous forms only on the wordpress backoffice, Im not sure it is the right path to solve this issue.p  pI would like someone to point me in the right direction so I can understand this problem better, in order to solve it. Thanks in advance.p

While the docs for ngUpload look pretty straightforward, Im not sure how to get the uploaded codecontentcode pushed to a CouchDB attachment.

Negative 916 pI really want my navigation code to fall below my content code for SEO purposes. But I have a layout where the navigation div is floated up and to the left of the main body content. This means the content sits beneath the nav div and wraps around the right side and the bottom of the nav div. As such, Ive conceded that the nav div must be nested inside the content div. Hence, the nav div code always ends up above my content which is poor for SEO results. Ive tried several different options to switch the content and the nav div around but to no avail. Ive tried floats, position relativeabsolute, negative margins, etc. to achieve the desired effect. None produce the desired effect and preserve the layout particularly the margins around the nav div between the nav and the body content. p  pAny suggestions would sure be appreciated.p  pPage is at a hrefhttpwww.netcentrictech.comcustomertest2ndtest.shtml relnofollowhttpwww.netcentrictech.comcustomertest2ndtest.shtmlap  pCSS a hrefhttpwww.netcentrictech.comcustomertestcsscustomtest.css relnofollowhttpwww.netcentrictech.comcustomertestcsscustomtest.cssap

Negative 916 pPlatform SharePoint 2013 I am using a custom search results page in which I am using a Search results web part. when I hover the mouse over the results, the fonts became slightly distorted in IE 8 only. Tried various tricks using CSS and JQuery with out success. The mouse hover event could not be disabled at all. It seems that IE 8 does something after all the JQuery and CSS runs. Tried to figure out using the Developer tool But could not find the onfocus event or Hover CSS. Any help is appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 916 pThere has been a lot of questions on this already that answer some of my questions. I am looking for someone who has direct experience with setting up and managing both accounts.p  pI have a situation where I need to send a private Beta test to more than 100 people the adhoc device limit for iOS, but I still want to be able to publish publicly to the app store.p  pMy solution is to obtain both an enterprise account and a regular developer account. The enterprise account allows me to distribute to anyone within my company, privately with no limit. The regular account gives me the ability to publish to the app store. Unfortunately this means I have two create two different apple developer accounts.p  pI am worried about the hidden caveats that are involved with this process. p  ul liIs there any caveats with managing two separate apple developer accounts for the same applicationli liAny problem with packaging names for applications Im assuming the identifier needs to be different.li liI hear that you cannot test the storekit with the enterprise program.

Negative 916 pI am a fan of Jeff Bays Object Calisthenics exercisep  pa hrefhttpwww.xpteam.comjeffwritingsobjectcalisthenics.rtf relnofollowhttpwww.xpteam.comjeffwritingsobjectcalisthenics.rtfap  pand I have had good results implementing first class collections by creating objects to encapsulate both the implementation of the collection and also the iteration over collections of objects.p  pThis means instead of a List I have a EmployeeList object.p  pTypically when I create these objects, I dont implement any collection interfaces so external users cannot enumerate the inner collection, as I thought this was the whole point. However, one colleague was suggesting the opposite  implement ICollect interface to make it more flexible.p  pThis refactoring site seems to be in the same direction, although it doesnt completely remove access to the inner collection a hrefhttpsourcemaking.comrefactoringencapsulatecollection relnofollowhttpsourcemaking.comrefactoringencapsulatecollectiona p  precode     Foreach method     foreach var employee in employees              if employee.IsManager                      managers.Addemployee                     Linq method     managers  employees.Wheree gt e.IsManager        Encapsulated iteration method     managers  employees.GetAllManagers      public IEnumerableltEmployeegt GetAllManagers  Inside Employees class              return employees.Wheree gt e.IsManager      codepre  pAm I right in saying the last method is favourable When would you ever want to expose your inner collection by implementing IEnumerable for examplep

I also tried Spy but it gave me the same hwnd for all child windows for some reason, must did something wrong.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Runtime.InteropServices using System.Diagnostics  namespace ConsoleApplication1      class Program              [DllImportUser32.dll]         public static extern int SendMessageIntPtr hWnd, int uMsg, int wParam, string lParam          private static IntPtr WinGetHandlestring wName                      IntPtr hWnd  IntPtr.Zero             foreach Process pList in Process.GetProcesses                              if pList.MainWindowTitle.ContainswName                                      hWnd  pList.MainWindowHandle                                           return hWnd                  static void Mainstring[] args                      ListltIntPtrgt myList  GetChildWindowsWinGetHandlechrome             foreachIntPtr ptr in myList                               No idea which one of those IntPtr is actually my textbox                 SendMessageIntPtr788018, 0x000C, 0, text here                          Console.ReadLine                   [DllImportuser32]         [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Bool]         public static extern bool EnumChildWindowsIntPtr window, EnumWindowProc callback, IntPtr i          public static ListltIntPtrgt GetChildWindowsIntPtr parent                      ListltIntPtrgt result  new ListltIntPtrgt             GCHandle listHandle  GCHandle.Allocresult             try                              EnumWindowProc childProc  new EnumWindowProcEnumWindow                 EnumChildWindowsparent, childProc, GCHandle.ToIntPtrlistHandle                          finally                              if listHandle.IsAllocated                     listHandle.Free                          return result                   private static bool EnumWindowIntPtr handle, IntPtr pointer                      GCHandle gch  GCHandle.FromIntPtrpointer             ListltIntPtrgt list  gch.Target as ListltIntPtrgt             if list  null                              throw new InvalidCastExceptionGCHandle Target could not be cast as ListltIntPtrgt                          list.Addhandle               You can modify this to check to see if you want to cancel the operation, then return a null here             return true                   public delegate bool EnumWindowProcIntPtr hWnd, IntPtr parameter       codepre

Negative 916 pSince C11, the Standard Library containers and codestdstringcode have constructors taking an initializerlist.

Negative 916 pI have been trying to find a way to find a way to append commas to a string or float. I have a float which could be anything from 10.50 to 50000000000.99 and would love to be able to format this to add commas to every 3 digits not including the floats. I know that there is a NSNumberFormatter that can use NSNumberFormatterDecimalStyle or NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle but neither of those work with stringsfloats. I have tried to split the float into two strings and then try to do a  of length  3 calculation but it began to get really really messy. I did something similar in Java but it seems to be a lot harder in iOS. p  pIf anyone have any suggestions or ideas Any information or guidance is appreciated Thanks in advance. p  pEdit I know there are posts out there but none of them seem to solve the problem with doublesfloatsstrings that end in zeros. For example, if I have a double as 16.00, the formatter will format that into 16. Same thing goes for a 1234.80. The formatter will format it into 1,234.8 instead of 1,234.80 and that is what I am looking for. p

Negative 916 pIm currently working on a webbased height map generator with Three.js. I use one canvas to show the actual generated height map, several others for displaying the separate octaves the height map consists of and another one for demonstrating the height map in action where it is applied directly to a plane mesh.p  pSo far so good. The whole stuff also renders perfectly fine with all the predefined parameters wavelength, etc.. The actual problem is, that the canvasses arent updating after the initial render pass which makes my program completely useless since the purpose of my program is to be able to manipulate the several parameters of the height map with sliders and see the effects in real time.p  pSadly the only canvas that updates at all is the one with the real 3D scene with the plane mesh. But also here it kind of seems like the data from the first render pass never got cleared, but at least it seems the uniforms for the noise parameters are updated correctly  this is obviously not the case for all the other canvasses.p  pBefore I finally render a scene, I always set the codeneedsUpdatecode field of the meshes material to codetruecode, but it only seems to work for that one canvas that got initialized last. Im completely lost here and also wasnt able to find any information about that issue.p

Negative 916 pI have absolutely basic question about sampling rate with regard to this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpsignalexamplesmeasuringsignalsimilarities.html relnofollowhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpsignalexamplesmeasuringsignalsimilarities.htmla first sectionp  pTwo first signals have FS4096, while the third is 8192. In simple words, the third signal was sampled two times more frequently. They say that to equalize the sample rates The safest way to do this is to resample the signal with a lower sampling rate. So, their procedure actually takes every second sample of the two first signals. But wasnt the third signal was sampled two times more frequently My intuition was exactly the opposite if something was sampled more frequently, then I would take every second sample of it. p  pWhat do I miss Thanks a lot,p  pVadimp

Negative 916 pTo avoid useless answer about how to implement AIDL in your own project  I understand how to use AIDL in your own project. p  pWhats unclear for me is how it is used in Android source code p  pFor example, there is IAudioService AIDL interface in android.media package. And there is AudioService java file. And there are a lot of examples where interface is defined in IInterfaceServiceName.aidl and implementation is in InterfaceServiceName.java. So, I thought that internals of AIDL look for Service with the name without first capital I, and then use it. However, this theory was demolished by IWifiManager and WifiService. p  pAll of this AIDL implementations, however, share one thing  they all extend IInterfaceName.Stub class. So, that means AIDL internals look for classes extending IInterfaceName.Stub But what if there are multiple classes extending it And those classes arent services at all...p  pOr there is some Service Manager, which somehow creates Services with those AIDL implementations as Binders If so, please direct me to this mysterious service manager.p  pEDIT Ive found this service manager. It is ServiceManager in package android.os. Now its understandable why those SomethingService arent actually services but are actually IBinders  the service manager somehow creates services with given IBinder by method add serviceString, IBinder. But now confusion only becomes even worse.  The implementation of this service also lies in somewhat strange ServiceManagerNative, which involves remote transaction with unknown IBinder. Now Im totally lost. How then does this ServiceManager starts itself up How are the services added by it p

Negative 916 pI have a legacy application that has a unit test module thats separate from the application modules. Im converting the project to use Gradle and the structure looks like thisp  precoderoot   module1   module2   ...   moduleN   test codepre  pwhere the test module executes tests for module1 through moduleN and depends on them. I know this isnt a very good practice as it kinda defeats the purpose of unit tests but as all know, legacy code is always a headache to work with. p  pSo before I start refactoring the code so that each module has its own unit tests which means disassembling the test module in a sensible way, i.e., a lot of work I wanted to find a temporary solution to get the correct code coverage, i.e., have JaCoCo instrument all the classes from module1, ..., moduleN instead of just module test.p  pIs there a way to tell JaCoCo to instrument classes from other modulesp

Negative 916 pIm trying to create a very basic game. The game is split into two distinct parts, and event driven part where nothing happens unless the player clicks buttons, and a real time element where the user clicks buttons but in response to real time events.p  pThe best example I can think of is the Rome Total War series. The campaign mode is pretty much entirely event driven, the battle mode is live. Football manager management mode  match mode is also similar.p  pI know its a stupidly general question but how do you go about programming such a game Are there any docs on this kind of thingp  pLanguage Id like to use if possible is Cp  pEDITp  pExample of code snippetsp  precodevoid UpdateCar1GameTime gameTime, float speed      a  floatgameTime.TotalGameTime.TotalSeconds  speed  float90  Math.PI  1802.5     X  Math.Cosa100     Y  Math.Sina100     Car1Position.X  100intX     Car1Position.Y  100intY  codepre  pThis makes a codeCarcode drive around in a circle.p  pTheres some code for detecting mouse button clicks on buttons  they just make the codeCarcode go faster or slower edited to pseudo code for clarity.p  precodeif mouse.LeftButton  ButtonState.Released ampamp previousButtonState  ButtonState.Pressed      if button click occured within faster button rectangle  go faster      if button click occured within slower button rectangle  go slower   codepre  pThe above is all well and good for the Real Time elements of the game. However for the Event Driven stuff it seems clumsy, I dont need the game to update 60 times a second for that, I only need it to update if a button is pressed.p  pMy question is whether there is a way to combine the two, as it clearly has been done with the above games.p

Negative 916 pI have an init method that makes a call to the databse.

The problem that I am having is that when I run this application normally I get a NullPointerException, but if I run it in debug I put a break point around here it works fine.  I believe this is due to the fact that these database calls are run on a different thread which takes more time, and is still null by the time the application uses the data.  So my question is what is the best way to go about this so that the application is able to process these methods before actually using themp  pI have tried doing Thread.sleep1000, but this seems very sloppy and works half the time.p  pStack trace below when run normallyp  precode....

Negative 916 pThe test program below creates a host thread for each GPU. Each host thread creates a cuFFT plan and executes the FFT.p  pMost of the time, the program seems to run without error. However, sometimes it fails in a variety of ways see below for example outputs. Does anybody have any idea why this program fails sometimesp  pIm running this program on a machine that has two Intel Xeon E5620 CPUs, 48 GB of host memory, and four Tesla C2075 cards, none of which are being used for display.

For reference, error codes 4 and 11 from cuFFT are CUFFTINVALIDVALUE and CUFFTINVALIDDEVICE respectively.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I am becoming more suspicious that the cuFFT is not thread safe, as the documentation seems to claim. If I protect the whole thread with a mutex i.e., only one thread can actually execute at a time, the program does not fail.

Each of these arrays contain Test Package Data. This array creates dynamically so we cant say how many items each time it will contain. Now Im haing one codetestpackidcode and I want to fetch only those array elements from the above array where the value of a key [testpackid] mathes with the value of a variable codetestpackidcode. I want to create a whole new array for these matching test package data items. Can anyone please help me in getting this arrayIf you need any more information I can provide you the same. Thank you so much for spending some of your valuable time and understanding my issue. Waiting for your replies.

The located assemblys manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. Exception from HRESULT0x80131040p blockquote  pI know others have had the same problem and there is other questions and answers about this topic. But I tried many things, but nothing helped. The version of log4net we use is 1.2.13.0.p  pI checked with FUSLOGVW.exe for binding errors. The log4net shows up with the added assembly and some Unknown assembly.  The reference of log4net in the assembly shows version 1.2.13.0 which was added with NuGet. So it is probably a dependent assembly that is causing all this trouble. I tried changing log4net back to version 1.2.12.0, but I still get the same error message.p  pWhen I run all the tests with MSTest testrunner, these errors show up. When I only run the failed tests, they pass. When I run them individually, they also pass. I tried binding redirection, but I did it for the assembly that is tested not the testing assembly.

Negative 916 pI was trying to use the app groups functionality, and wasnt able to get it working properly.p  pAs per this document a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsappschangelogv20games relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsappschangelogv20gamesap  pIt states that the behavior is changed as follows 1 Join Group Dialog  Apps can now show a clientside dialog as an alternative to adding users to a group on the serverside. 2 Add user to group by API removed  Apps can no longer add any user to a group via API. They can only add users that have a role on the appadmins, developers, testers, test users.p  pAnd here a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsgamesappgamegroupsv2.0 relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsgamesappgamegroupsv2.0ap  pThe logic is described as follows After viewing a group, a player may want to join. Games should provide browse or search functionality to help players find groups. Games need to create a request and approve flow for users to be added to groups. You should use ingame messaging to communicate invites and may consider using App Notifications or Requests. When you want to add the player to the group  after the admin and player has approved , you can show a join dialog. When theyve been added, a notification will be sent to the user that the player has been added.p  pSo what I understood, that the app access token cant be used to invite or add members anymore through the server, except in case of Devs, Testers, etc. users who can be added directly through Graph API. And now the users need to join on client side after admin approval if any.p  pBut when I tried creating a sample iOS app which is bounded to my Facebook test app, the following code didnt work I did create the group using the app access token through Graph APIp  precodeNSDictionary mparams  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys                         ltgroupidgt, id, nil] [FBWebDialogs presentDialogModallyWithSessionFBSession.activeSession                                     dialoggamegroupjoin                                       parametersmparams                                       handlerFBWebDialogResult result,                                                 NSURL resultURL,                                                 NSError error                                            if error                                            codepre  pI just got blank page when the popup appears, probably its not able to viewread this group .

Negative 916 pIm looking for a welloptimized function that accepts an coden X ncode distance matrix and returns an coden X kcode matrix with the indices of the codekcode nearest neighbors of the ith datapoint in the ith row. p  pI find a gazillion different codeRcode packages that let you do KNN, but they all seem to include the distance computations along with the sorting algorithm within the same function.  In particular, for most routines the main argument is the original data matrix, not a distance matrix. In my case, Im using a nonstandard distance on mixed variable types, so I need to separate the sorting problem from the distance computations.  p  pThis is not exactly a daunting problem  I obviously could just use the codeordercode function inside a loop to get what I want see my solution below, but this is far from optimal.  For example, the codesortcode function with codepartial  1kcode when codekcode is small less than 11 goes much faster, but unfortunately returns only sorted values rather than the desired indices.p

In other words, the name of each array in codearrcode a, b, c, d has to be able to be referenced in the results. For claritys sake, say that codearr[oilprice, countries, vesseltypes]code.

Negative 916 pHere is the scenario p  ol liI have two interface wlan0 and test0logical.li liI have no control over wlan0 device driver and I have full control over the test0 device driverxD.li litest0 actually sends some packet using wlan0 internallyli liwlan0 has no associated ip but test0 hasli ol  pSo now when I try to send ping command to any device connected to wlan0. The packet reaches the target device and target device responds with ping response. The packet is receive at wlan0 and pushed to the ip protocol. But ip protocol drops the packet as there is ip protocol associated with wlan0 while trying to route the packet inside kernel.p  pSo, I naively changed the ip protocol routing decision without affecting normal decision by adding a clause like below p  ol liif there is no ip associated with cur dev ampamp cur dev  test0 then goto 3 else goto 4li liroute the packet and goto 5li liset dev  test0 and goto 1li lidrop the frameli lifinishli ol  pSo, now I can send and receive packets but this solution is not good because for every protocol which I want to support in the given scenario, I must add the clause e,g ARP. So, my question is what should be the better wayapproach to handle packet routing in such cases.p

I need to create an instance using this .class file in the second machine this machine doesnt contain its .java file using reflections but i receive the following error. Further my project consists of various packages  one for the server and another for the client. While using reflections, I try to supply just the class name copied class which makes me wonder if that is an issue.

Negative 916 pI started my adventure with Spring MVC framework. My current background is rather Adobe CQ5 applications.

Negative 916 pI need to populate an element with data from two variables depending on what the user selects from a list of choices. I have a view function that gets the table id from post does it have to be post and returns additional information about that id from the table. So I need to get the two variables somehow from my view function to the template. The problem is how should I return it by httprequest, render, or rendertoresponse and do I use the same template that I used to send the ajax data I have seen tutorials that just returns httpresponse with one variable and no template, which just confuses me more than anything. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 916 pIm trying to find an efficient way to influence the shape and the content of the JavaFX GUI elements, such as simple codePanecode, with use of multithreading. Lets say I have a simple codePanecode, on which I display filled codeCirclecodes at the given itervals of time, and I want to have the posibility to answer to them, e.g. by hitting the corresponding key. So far, for this purpose,  I tried to use class with the implementation of codeRunnablecode interface and creation of classic codeThreadcode object in it, in order to add andor remove elements from the external JavaFX codePanecode, which was passed to that thread class in its constructor parameter from the main codeApplicationcode class. Say, both classes, 1 application and 2 thread class, looks like thisp  precodeimport javafx.application.Application import javafx.scene.Parent import javafx.scene.Scene import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane import javafx.scene.layout.Pane import javafx.scene.paint.Color import javafx.scene.shape.Circle import javafx.stage.Stage  public class ClassApplication extends Application       private Pane pane      public Parent createContent            layout          BorderPane layout  new BorderPane           layout gt center          pane  new Pane         pane.setMinWidth250         pane.setMaxWidth250         pane.setMinHeight250         pane.setMaxHeight250         pane.setStylefxbackgroundcolor 000000           layout gt center gt pane          Circle circle  new Circle125, 125, 10, Color.WHITE           add items to the layout          pane.getChildren.addcircle          layout.setCenterpane         return layout           Override     public void startStage stage throws Exception          stage.setScenenew ScenecreateContent         stage.setWidth300         stage.setHeight300         stage.show           initialize custom Thread          ClassThread thread  new ClassThreadpane         thread.execute           public static void mainString args[]          launchargs       codepre  p...and the thread classp  precodeimport javafx.scene.layout.Pane import javafx.scene.paint.Color import javafx.scene.shape.Circle  public class ClassThread implements Runnable       private Thread t     private Pane pane      ClassThreadPane p          this.pane  p          t  new Threadthis, Painter           Override     public void run          try              Thread.sleep2000             Circle circle  new Circle50, 50, 10, Color.RED             pane.getChildren.clear             pane.getChildren.addcircle           catch InterruptedException ie              ie.printStackTrace                    public void execute          t.start       codepre  pHowever, such a solution, where in Swing application could be possible, in JavaFX is impossible, and whats more, is the reason of the following exceptionp  precodeException in thread Painter java.lang.IllegalStateException Not on FX application thread currentThread  Painter     at com.sun.javafx.tk.Toolkit.checkFxUserThreadUnknown Source     at com.sun.javafx.tk.quantum.QuantumToolkit.checkFxUserThreadUnknown Source     at javafx.scene.Parent2.onProposedChangeUnknown Source     at com.sun.javafx.collections.VetoableListDecorator.clearUnknown Source     at ClassThread.runClassThread.java21     at java.lang.Thread.runUnknown Source codepre  p...where the line 21 is codepane.getChildren.clearcodep  pIve concluded, that there is a problem with influencing the main JavaFX thread from the level of another thread.

Negative 916 pIm aware that codeThread.stopcode is deprecated, and for good reason it is not, in general, safe. But that doesnt mean that it is emneverem safe... as far as I can see, it is safe in the context in which I want to use it and, as far as I can see, I have no other option.p  pThe context is a thirdparty plugin for a twoplayer strategy game chess will do as the working example. The thirdparty code needs to be given a current board state, and say 10 seconds to decide on its move. It can return its move and terminate within the allowable time, or it can, whenever it wants to, signal its current preferred move if the time limit expires, it should be stopped in its tracks, and its most recent preferred move should be played.p  pWriting the plugin to stop gracefully on request is strongnot an optionstrong I need to be able to take arbitrary untrusted thirdparty plugins. So I have to have some way of forcibly terminating it.p  pHeres what Im doing to lock it downp  ol liThe classes for the plugin get put into their own thread, into their own thread group.li liThey are loaded with a class loader that has a highly restrictive codeSecurityManagercode in place all the classes can do is number crunching.li liThe classes dont get a reference to any other threads, so they cant use codeThread.joincode on anything they havent created.li liThe plugin gets only two references to objects from the host system. One is the state of the chess board this is a deep copy, and is thrown away afterwards, so it doesnt matter if it gets into an inconsistent state. The other is a simple object that allows the plugin to set its current preferred move.li liIm checking when CPU time has exceeded the limit, and Im periodically checking that at least one thread of the plugin is doing something so that it cant sleep indefinitely and avoid CPU time ever hitting the limit.li liThe preferred move doesnt have enough state to be inconsistent, but in any case it is carefully and defensively cloned after it is returned, and the one that was returned is discarded. By this point, there is strongnothingstrong left in the host system to which the plugin had a reference no threads, no object instances.li ol  pIn consequence, it seems, the plugin cant leave anything in an inconsistent state except for any objects it might create, which will then be discarded and it cant affect any other threads except for any threads it spawns, which will be in the same codeThreadGroupcode, and so will also be killed off.p  pIt looks to me as though the reasons that codeThread.stopcode is deprecated dont apply here by design.

If youre at the beginning of the dot navigation series and click left, it goes to the end, otherwise the picture displayed is determined by the codedatacode attribute of whichever dot you clicked.p  precoden.attrid  right  currentIndex  slider li.size       1 currentIndex  0  currentIndex  n.attrid      left  currentIndex  0  currentIndex  slider li     .size  1  currentIndex  currentIndex  n.attrdataposition codepre  pWhat I cant wrap my head around is this code codecurrentIndex  slider li.size  1codep  pIf the codecurrentIndexcode of the slider is at the end of the list, then the highlighted dot navigation goes back to index position 0, but why does it determine this by checking the size, and emthenem subtracting 1 Wouldnt it make sense to check if codecurrentIndexcode equals the result of code.sizecode But when I remove the code1code the dot navigation, will disappear off the page, for however long the interval specifies, before showing up at poisition 0 again. If I change it to code2code the dot nav stops at the second to last point before it loops back around. Replacing code.sizecode with code.lengthcode does the same thing.p  pThe reason emwhyem the code1code is there has been answered, but why does code.sizecode and code.lengthcode not work the way I think it shouldp

Negative 916 pI have been given the following exercisep  pGiven polynomial emPem and a real sequence emxsub1subem, ..., emxsubnsubem, find data structure emDem that can evaluate expressions of the form emSi, j  P0xsubisub  P1xsubi  1sub  ...  Pj  i  1xsubj  1subem in constant time with some preprocessing done on emxsub1subem, ..., emxsubnsubem.p  pI have been trying to solve it for quite some time now and have not had much of a success. An obvious solution requires emOnsup2supem preprocessing time for every emjem in em1 ... nem, I can calculate emPj  asub0sub  jasub1sub  jsup2supasub2sub  ... jsupmsupasubmsubem in emOmnem time. Then I can calculate prefix sums for any emSi, jem where emj  iem in emOnem time for each distinct emiem, thus proceeding in emOnsup2supem time altogether. I am just taking regular prefix sums separately for every possible emiem. I would like to go asymptotically faster than this, if possible.p  pThe problem seems to be that the calculation of emSi, jem yields no useful information about emSi  1, jem. Look emSi, j  P0xsub1sub  P1xsub2sub  ...em, but emSi  1, j  P0xsub2sub  P1xsub3subem. See The emPems have moved right. If there was a way to calculate emSi  1, jem from emSi, jem, I believe I could proceed in emOmnem time.p  pI have triedp  ul lipCalculate regular prefix sums for emxsub1subem, ..., emxsubnsubem and manipulating the expressions so that the regular prefix sum could be used  to calculate emSi, jem with no success.pli lipWrite the explicit formula for emSi, jem and grouping the terms by polynomial coefficients emasubisubems rather than by  emxsubisubems. The problem remains the same.pli ul  pIf you can do faster, please, give me a hint how to proceed. strongPlease do not give explicit solutionsstrong, I would like to figure it out myself.p  pP.S.

Negative 916 pI have run the face detection algorithm inbuilt in opencv to extract faces in each frame of a videosampled at 1 fps. I have also resized each face image to be of same size and I have cropped some fraction of image to remove background noise and hair. Now the problem is that I have to cluster these images of faces  Each cluster corresponding to a person. I implemented the algorithm described here a hrefhttpbitsearch.blogspot.in201302unsupervisedfaceclusteringwithopencv.html relnofollowhttpbitsearch.blogspot.in201302unsupervisedfaceclusteringwithopencv.htmlap  pBasically the above algorithm, uses LBPH face recognizer of OpenCV iteratively to cluster the images. In the description on that page itself the results are not satisfactory. In my implementation the results are worse. Can anyone suggest a better way to cluster faces May be using some other feature and some other clustering algorithm. The number of clusters are unknown. p

Negative 916 pMy problem is I made a custom stencil for mudbox in paint.net. I tried both .png and .tiff formats to export.p  pI have also noticed that my custom stencil, unlike the original ones, can only be projected where it is displayedit is not borderless, so it has to be moved exactly to painting location. However this is not the problem.p  pThe problem is that, unlike the original stencils, my stencil disappears whenever I select any tool other than projection, not allowing me to use standard paint brush which I have to use.p  pWhat can I do to fix these issues that are only happening to my custom stencils What can I do to make my custom stencils function exactly as my original stencils. p
Negative 916 pSo, Ive been given a problem to implement a program that returns codetruecode if an array of sorted integers contains numbers greater than codeIcode but less than codeucode, codefalsecode otherwise.p  pIve identified that a quick sort algorithm would be a good way to sort the array, because I cant know how the user will enter it in  then, I feed the sorted array to binary search and find out if the array contains integers within the specified range.

Negative 916 pIm doing the exercises from SICP not homework and exercise 2.20 introduces dottedtail notation, which is where you use codedefine f a . b ...code to pass a variable number of arguments which end up in a list codebcode. This problem in particular wants a procedure which takes an integer codeacode and returns a list of all arguments with parity equal to codeacodes. The problem is not difficult here is my solutionp  precodedefine sameparity a . b a is an int, b is any number of int arguments   let parity remainder a 2     define proc li       cond null li null              If parity of the head of the list is  parity of a,              remainder car li 2 parity               keep it and check the rest of the list.              cons car li proc cdr li              Otherwise ignore it and check the rest of the list.             else proc cdr li     cons a proc b codepre  pMy question is that I dont seem to be using the dottedtail feature at all. I might as well have just accepted exactly two arguments, a number and a list Im effectively wrapping the algorithm in a procedure codeproccode which does away with the dottedtail thing. p  pBefore I wrote this solution, I wanted to have a recursive call resemblingp  pcodesameparity a . cdr bcodep  por something spiritually similar, but no matter how I tried it, I kept passing lists of lists or extra procedures or whatever. This could be because I dont know emexactlyem what code.code does, only what I want it to do the Racket docs didnt clear anything up either. To sum up,p  pstrongIs my solution what was intended for this exercise, or is there a way to actually use the dot notation which seems to be the point of the exercise in the algorithmstrongp

Negative 916 pIm using an html5 codeltinput typedategtcode with a knockout binding. Im using webshim for browsers that dont support html5 dates.p  pThe native html5 browsers are working perfectly, changing the date changes the model, changing the model programmatically changes the date shown in the date input.p  pChanging the date on a browser that does not support html5 e.g. IE8 works correctly and updates the knockout model, but the reverse is not true. Changes to the model are not propagated to the webshimgenerated date picker, only to the hidden input that webshim uses.p  pIs there a webshim provided method or event I can call or fire to tell it to look at the data and update the UI after a change How could I write a knockout binding to call thisp

Currently in the process of migrating the stand alone EC2 to an  ElasticbeanStalk worker application.

Negative 916 pI am using programming in D to learn about D language. I wrote a simple program that spawns a worker and sends it a number to receive its square as a string. The worker 1 gets the number squares it and sends to worker 2 a different function to get casted as string which is returned to the worker 1 and thus it returns it to the main function call.

Negative 916 pIm having trouble showing what I put in my ArrayList on JSP. The items in the list are taken from a Database in a Java class and then are shown in the JSP. Ive tried using the cforEach but I still dont get it that much. Im new to JSP and Im trying not to use the scriplets. Thats why I do everything over my Java class. Also so that you got an idea on how it works, the admin chooses to see the whole database of the users, so it chooses on a option radio button tag, goes to a JSP page where it evaluates what the admin wants to see and forwards to the other page where the Arraylist must be shown. I call the function of the List in the JSP page that forwards to the JSP that shows the Database. I dont know if thats the correct way.

Negative 916 pUsing Cython acting as an interface so I can call C based functions via Python, I am trying to wrap a complicated hierarchal structure of C classes, all of which eventually inherit from one base class. This singular base class has many virtual functions, whose implementation is different based on the derived class under consideration. Derived classes also have their own unique functions as well. p  pI am having a lot of trouble wrapping this via Cython, primarily because I cant find a way to redefine iself.thisptri within each of the inherited classes to be of that specific type rather than the type of the singular base class. I have also tried typecasting, as well as trying to delete the pointer and then reinitialize it, but it still thinks its pointing to the same base class.

When I view it locally, it looks perfect.  However, when I upload it to my hosting account  hostmonster.com, for some reason it gains this extra whitespace at the bottom of the page.

It appears to be emoutsideem of the html document.  In Chrome developers console it says something about shockwave flash at the bottom of the page where the white space is... I dont know what that is, I didnt put it there, and Im assuming right now that its put in there by hostmonster.  Im not sure if thats whats causing the white space but I just wanted to point it out just in case.p  pPlease let me know if you figure out whats causing this white space and how to get rid of itp  pThanksp  pNamaste.p

Negative 916 pI have a page which is used for both create and update. When a user writes a name and if that name doesnt exist in database it will be added along with the newly created description through tinyMCE plugin This part works perfectly. But when user selects an already existing name, an AJAX request is fired to pull the description. I am able to pull the description correctly but the response text is not shown in the tinyMCE. I am using the latest version of tinyMCE.p  pMy question is how can i reinitialize the tinyMCE control which has already been initialize on page load, or is there any other way to achieve this, as i want the existing description to be updated p

It also makes the code a hell of a lot cleaner.p  pI also removed codeapp.execcode in my main.cpp because I no longer needed the event loop that codeQCoreApplicationcode provides.p  pWhat I learned codeQThreadcode isnt the only way to achieve multithreading. In my case, it makes more sense to use codeQThreadPoolcode because I didnt need the signalsslots of codeQThreadcode. Also, you shouldnt use the codeQCoreApplicationcode event loop if it is not needed.

Negative 916 pI have a cascading knockout dropdown menu, when the first one is selected another select menu is created and added below it. This is done using a template bound to a list, the menus are added to this list and are bound to the DOM automatically.  The problem is if the user is scrolling through the options like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAOu3R.png altenter image description here brand hits the Next right arrow, which is intended to take you to the next input it selects the option that is currently hovered in this case June 18 and creates the new select but then instead of the navigating to the newly created select menu to it skips it and goes to the one after that in my case way down the page. If you then hit Previous it brings you back to the newly created dropdown.p  pIs there a way to override that functionality so that it waits for the new dropdown to be created and navigate to it instead of skipping over it when Next is pressedp  pEDIT Also it should be noted that I did bind tab index to the menus, they are showing in the correct order, Tab index 1 then 2 then 3, so that is not the issue, it must be about the element not existing.p

Note that this does not necessarily mean the labels will be sorted lexicographicallyp blockquote  pIn my case, sortlevel did the right thing, but what if my original ordering of the associated factor was not sorted Is there a simple oneliner that I can use on any MultiIndexed DataFrame to ensure its ready for slicing and fully lexsortedp  hr  pEdit My exploration suggests most ways of creating a MultiIndex automatically lexsorts the unique labels when building the index. Examplep  precodeIn [1]  import pandas as pd df  pd.DataFramecol1 [b,d,b,a], col2 [3,1,1,2],                   data[one,two,three,four] df  Out[1]    col1  col2   data 0    b     3    one 1    d     1    two 2    b     1  three 3    a     2   four  In [2] df2  df.setindex[col1,col2] df2  Out[2]              data col1 col2        b    3       one d    1       two b    1     three a    2      four  In [3] df2.index Out[3]  MultiIndexlevels[[ua, ub, ud], [1, 2, 3]],            labels[[1, 2, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0, 1]],            names[ucol1, ucol2] codepre  pNote how the unique items in the levels array are lexsorted, even though the DataFrame object is  itself is not.

This feels a little like what the warning in the docs is getting at, but its still not clear how to fix it or whether its really an issue at all.p

Negative 916 pWe use codeAppDomain.ExecuteAssemblycode to fork an executable from itself. That can be used to dynamically update the app.config when starting see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma363315821567thisa old post.p  pApparently, calling codeAppDomain.ExecuteAssemblycode sets the title of the current console window to the codeAssembly.CodeBasecode value of the assembly being executed. When the function returns, i.e. the execution resumes to the calling AppDomain, the title is reverted back.p  pWhile it does no real harm, it is a little annoying, when you have a large batch file that calls such executable multiple times the console title constantly changes.p  pHere is a repro examplep  precodeusing System  public class Foo       public static int Mainstring[] args               if AppDomain.CurrentDomain.FriendlyName.EqualsTest                       Console.WriteLineInside              While in here, the console title is something              like fileCSourcesFoo.exe.

The actual function would probably by codenExecuteAssemblycode inside the CLR, which is not included in the open source CoreCLR, because that doesnt support AppDomains. Also, the SSCLI source code emseemsem to have no relevant code albeit Im not sure, nor can check, if that behaviour could also be seen with the CLR 2.x.p  pstrongUpdatesstrongp  ul lipWindows applications compiler switch codetargetwinexecode do emnotem exhibit this behavior.

Negative 916 pIm trying to use SparkleShare to keep Git repos in sync automatically. Unfortunately, with the default configuration, that is a dangerous proposition. If I resume my suspended computer, the only way to get it to sync is to restart the service. I can only imagine the many problems that will cause when working with colleagues using laptops.p  pIn a hrefhttpsgithub.comhbonsSparkleShareissues794 relnofollowthis GitHub issuea there is no solution given. However, my case is somewhat different, because I just want to make it sync on resuming the computer, not necessarily by using a force sync button which is less than optimal in any event. Is there a solution Im using Linux.p

Negative 916 pI am reviewing multiple Rich Text Editors to find the right one for a VB.NET web application which has IE11 incompatible Rich Text Editor.p  pWith the IE11 compatibility, the most important requirement from clients is a functionality that copies contents from Word documents over into text editor without losing it Word formatting. The content will be saved into database and be read by MS Word againp  pHowever, all the Rich Text Editors that I have reviewed do not support the multilevel list formatting correctly. They change the multilevel numbers into single level numbers when coping the multilevel list from Word into them.  Rad Editor, CKEditor, tinymce and Rich Text Editor and so on.p  pExample,p  precode1. A   1.1. B   1.2. B     1.2.1. C 2. A   2.1. B   2.2. B codepre  pbecomesp  precode1. A   1. B   2. B     1. C 2. A   1. B   2. B codepre  pI found a CSS trick to display codeltligtcode tag as multilevel numbers in the browser, but the numbers are not actual text values that can be saved into database. So, I need another solution that can save numbers and their format into the database like the current Rich Text Editor in my VB.Net web application. It is a DLL, but not JavaScript libraryp  pCan I get some helpsadvices how to resolve this problem when copying over multilevel numbering list from Word into the RichTextEditorp  pThanks for answering in advance.p

Negative 916 pHow would I go about updating a status bar label with the MVP pattern in a winforms project p  pThe trouble Im having is understanding if the label should have a view of its own, or if the label should bind to some kind of base class for all presenters that share a message property. With the later option, each presenter can just call codeme.message  Hellocode that updates the view via codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode. My concern with this the the base class could become overly bloated as once Ive included some basic error handing etc in the same way the base class will end up containing lots of information it may never need to use. p  pTo me it makes more sense to create seperate objects to handle a message pump that presenters have access to if they require it.p  pOnly way I can think of doing this is creating a singleton messages class the status label can bind too. Presenters would add messages via a call to the shared method codeMessages.AddMessageHellocode. But in doing this Ive strongly coupled all presenters to the messages object. Likewise the same theory applies to any error handling and logging classes I may wish to add at a later date.  p  pEdit  For a more detailed explanation  I have some service level DLLs which collect data from a number of backend systems. I have also created a number of model objects to persist those items. A further class library is used to pull the those services into a business process that will be required in two front ends  one is a console app which runs unattended. The other is the winforms app that a user interacts with. This class library is where my presenters reside and my view Interfaces. What Id like to know is how do I push messages to the status bar in a winforms app from the presenter which resides in my class library. Does that put it in a better context  Im still learning MVP but I believe what Im referring to may be called a Cross cutting concern  ie. my message feed to the UI is used by all presenters and is not a concern of just one presenter p
