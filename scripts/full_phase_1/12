Negative 12 pThis is part of a larger program Ill explain only the relevant parts.  Basically, my code wants to create a new connection to a remote host.  This should return a Deferred, which fires once the connection is established, so I can send something on it.p  pIm creating the connection with codetwisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorSSL.connectSSLcode.  That calls codebuildProtocolcode on my codeClientFactorycode instance to get a new connection codetwisted.internet.protocol.Protocolcode object, and returns a codetwisted.internet.interfaces.IConnectorcode.  When the connection is started, Twisted calls codestartedConnectingcode on the factory, giving it the codeIConnectorcode.  When the connection is actually made, the protocols codeconnectionMadecode callback is called, with no arguments.p  pNow, if I only needed one connection per hostport, the rest would be easy.  Before calling codeconnectSSLcode, I would create a Deferred and put it in a dictionary keyed on host, port.  Then, in the protocols connectionMade, I could use codeself.transport.getPeercode to retrieve the hostport, use it to look up the Deferred, and fire its callbacks.  But this obviously breaks down if I want to create more than one connection.p  pThe problem is that I cant see any other way to associate a Deferred I created before calling codeconnectSSLcode with the codeconnectionMadecode later on.p

Negative 12 pWe have a problem here. p  pWe need to translate a website into multiple language.  We already use gettext to translate the static content. But we have to translate some text content in multiple language.p  pThe ui isnt a problem.p  pWe found 2 ways to translate the text.  1. use JSON inside our text input Why this solution is bad. Every text input will need to be bigger because we cant guess the real size of the attribute.p  ol lipUse the a translating table that keep reference to the original model and translate every field. It will still need big field because we cant define the field size by record.pli lipFinally, the best solution I came with is creating a translating table. The table will keep foreign key of other tables. For each translation, we copy the record that need to be translated. Inside the translation table, there is 4 field, modelnameprimary, referenceidprimary, translatedidprimary, localeprimary. This solution make it impossible to have multiple translation for the same model in the same language.pli lipLast but not least, we could use something like someone proposed...a database gettext. We have a table that contain strings and only string key, text, locale so we can search for a model, a string that is the same as the one used in the model and then use the we found instead.pli ol  pMy opinion is that all of these solutions are hack, the 4 solution is probably the one that looks better.p  pAs I didnt found any good documentation, I would really like to make this question shine.p
Negative 12 pI am working on a turnbasedgame AI using a neuralnetwork technique known as a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNeuroEvolution5Fof5FAugmenting5FTopologies relnofollowNEATa. I am attempting to train a network that can move around a two dimensional XampY coords space given a variety of values that are stored in what is effectively a two dimensional array.p  pI can see two strategies for using the neural networkp  ol lipFor each cell in the grid, provide the scores from the different heuristics as inputs to neurons and create a NN that is effectively a very complicated scoring system. Move the Non Playing Character NPC to the location with the highest score.pli lipCreate a compressed value for each heiuristic measure somehow compressed into as few bits as possible and provide an input neuron for each of these measures.pli ol  pI am quite interested in option two because it presents the least amount of calculations required the runtime of the game is quite long, however I am confused as to what approach I could use to create the small representation version of the twodimensional heiuristic values. I know there are techniques such as Fourier Transformations out there, however I dont know if these will suit my problem. Basically I am looking for a way to convert a 50x50 array of doubles into one or maybe two double values. These two double values can be lossycompressed, I dont need to be able to get the original values back, I just need a reasonable mechanism for changing the input data into a small footprint.p  pAn alternative to these two possibilities is to somehow encode a region based on some distance from the NPC so you get the actual values for a close cell, and an approximation for a far cell. I dont know exactly how I would wire this up, but it at least gets rid of the need to evaluate every cell every turn of the game given I am looking at about 5 million rounds at approximately 1 second per round, any simplification I can come up with would greatly help.p  pI apologise if this isnt making much sense, it is quite a difficult problem that has stumped me for a while, and I cant think of an easy way to describe it.p  pThankyou,p  pAidanp  pEDITED TO ADD and change titlep  pThanks to Chris weve refined what I am looking for. What I am looking for is a way to approximate a line I can convert the 2D map into a line in as few parameters as possible. I have used cubic splines for interpolation before, however I need something a lot more feasable for a dataset that varies between 0.0 and 1.0 quite aggressively. What I am realling looking for I suppose is a hash of the map.p  pI know there are techniques such as cubic splines that I can work out some keypoints from, and these values are a reasonable analogy for what I am looking for. I need a way to take the 2500 values and come up with a small representation of these values that I can use for the neural network. I think the NN can be trained to infer the true meaning of these representations, or at least to determine some correlation between the representation and the real world, so it doesnt necessarily need to be a reversible function, but I dont think many one way functions such as MD5s, SHAs are actually going to be very helpful either...p

This way, theres less of a chance of the user seeing blank or currently rendering portions of the waveform.  Still, if a user quickly scrolls to a distant area, the whole section will be blank until rendering is complete.pli ul  pThe problem is, many applications handle this in different ways.  p  pFor examplep  pstrongAdobe Acrobatstrong  renders blank pages during scroll unless page is in cache.  Any pages that would be visible within the document render area are rendered in a separate thread and are presented opon completion.p  pstrongMicrosoft Wordstrong  Essentially, the same as above.  Documents are separated into distinct pages, so each page is processedrendered on an asneeded basis and added to a cache.p  pstrongInternet Explorerstrong  Unknown. It appears that an entire webpage is rendered in graphic memory, no matter how many screens worth of graphic data it consumes.  Theoretically, with a web page that scrolls for 10 or 15 screen lengths, this could mean 5060MB worth of graphic memory consumption.  Could anyone with experience with WebKit or FireFox explain whether or not the rendering engine favors consuming a ton of memory, or tries to render peices of the page on the fly to conserve memoryp  pIf it helps, my application is based on C, .NET 3.5, and WinForms.p

Negative 12 pIn Vista and later, if an app becomes unresponsive, the Desktop Window Manager is able to handle redrawing it when necessary move a window over it, drag it around, etc. because it has kept a pixel buffer for it.  Windows also tries to detect when an app has become unresponsive after some timeout, and tries to make the best of the situation  I believe it dims out the window, adds Not Responding to its title bar, and perhaps some other effects.p  pNow, we have a skinned app that uses window regions and layered windows, and it doesnt play well with these effects.  Weve been developing on XP, but have noticed a strange effect when testing on Vista.  At some points the app may spend a few moments on some calculation or callback, and if a message has not been retrieved within 5 seconds, the DWM declares the window to be hung a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd74476528VS.8529.aspx relnofollowMSDN  Preventing Hangs in Windows Applicationsa. It seems that when this kicks in, a strange graphical problem occurs any pixels that would be 100 transparent due to the window regions turn black, which effectively makes the window rectangular again, with a black background.  There seem to be other anomalies, with the original windows pixels being shifted a bit in some child dialogs.p  pI am working on reducing such delays ideally Windows will never need to step in like this, and trying to maintain responsiveness while its busy, but Id still like to figure out what is causing it to render like that, as I cant guarantee I can eliminate all delays.p  pBasically, I just would like to know what Windows is doing when this happens, and how I can make my app behave properly with it.  Skinned apps have to still work on Vista and later, so I need to figure out what Im doing thats nonstandard.  I dont even know exactly how to look for information into how Windows now handles unresponsive apps, as my searches only return people having issues with apps that are unresponsive, or very rudimentary explanations of what the DWM does with such apps.  Heck Im not even 100 sure its the DWM responsible, but it seems likely.  Any potential leadsp  pPhoto of problem screen shots wont capture the effect note that the white dialogs buffer is shifted  it is shifted exactly by the distance it has been offset from the main blue windowp  pimg srchttpi42.tinypic.com15ee8wo.jpg altUnresponsive appp

When I enter details and press submit, instead of sending the data to codeloginservletcode, it sends it to codesamloginservletcode and then tomcat tells me there is no such servlet here Obviously there isnt.

Negative 12 pI have some pages that have content that is relevant to both logged in users and non logged in users. For example, pages with contact information, privacy policies, etc. All the pages have your typical navigation menu but the thing is logged in users normally see a different navigation menu bar than non logged in users.p  pWhat is the best way to do this in ASP.netp  pSo far, possible solutions include the followingp  ol liDisplaying the content using a pop up window. The page will contain no menu and is just some basic page doesnt need to check what type of user is seeing it. li liProgrammatically changing the master page depending on whether the user is authenticated or not. However, there are some variables on one of the master pages that need to be accessed but isnt touched at all by non logged in users.li liPutting the content in a user control and sticking this user control on two separate pages to be displayed to the appropriate user.li ol  pIm not really a fan of 1 because users visiting the site for the first time may have some type of popup blocker or have javascript disabled. p  pI know 2 is possible by having the page use some type of base class that has inherited from MasterPage. However, Ive read that this might not be the best design since now one of the pages has access to variables that isnt really necessary.p  pThe third method sounds reasonable but then thered be two separate ASPX files.p  pIs there a proper way of doing this Or another method I havent thought of yetp  pstrongeditstrongp  pTo clarify, logged in users need to set certain variables in their master pages where non logged in users do not. The reason for this is that there is a user control that displays a special navigation menu that will highlight certain items depending on these variables.p  pFor example, the user control requires a string to determine which item to highlight. A page with profile information will provide profile as a parameter that will highlight the Profile item on the menu.p  pThe menu in the user control is generated dynamically based on data from the database. The menu items are grouped by category and are displayed with an appropriate heading that is also pulled from the DB.p

I have used C extensively so using the features of C is not a problem.p  pThe protocol stack has three layers and it is already fully specified and formally verified.

Should also mention that protocol is very simple but can run on different devices over a reliable physical transport layer. I know the events, inputs, outputs, side effects and the behaviour of the protocol state machines. Generally, an interrupt is received to read the message received from the physical layer to read it and send to the waiting device. The receiving device can process and pass the response message to the protocol layer to send out on the physical layer.p  pAny help with referencesrecommendations will be appreciated. I am willing to use a different language if only to help me understand how to implement them but I will have to eventually resort to the language of choice.p  pstrongUpdatestrong An example protocol I wish to implement is something like a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu882753NFC20Simple20NDEF20Exchange20Protocol20Specification201.0.pdfSNEPa.p  pI do not need to worry about connection management.

Negative 12 pI think there are people who may be able to answer this, this is a question out of curiosityp  pThe generic codeCreateInstancecode method from codeSystem.Activatorcode, introduced in .NET v2 has no type constraints on the generic argument but does require a default constructor on the activated type, otherwise a codeMissingMethodExceptioncode is thrown. To me it seems obvious that this method should have a type constraint likep  precodeActivator.CreateInstanceltTgt where T  new     ...  codepre  pJust an omission or some anecdote lurking herep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAs pointed out, the compiler does not allow you to writep  precodeprivate T CreateltTgt where T  struct, new error CS0451 The new constraint cannot be used with the struct constraint codepre  pHowever, see comments a struct can be used as type argument to a generic method specifying a new constraint.

Negative 12 pIm starting to do maintenance on a web based system my company is taking over. Its quite large at least for our standards.

Are codeSELECTcode statements faster when the user who executes them only has codeSELECTcode privileges If not, what other reasons are there to do something like thisp  pNote I cant contact the original developers at this moment, I know that would be an easy way to get an answer....p  pEDIT based on the answers I have some other questions. The webapplication is the only application that uses the database. No one else connects to the database. The programmers there were only two have full control over what the connected user does. They have defended well against injections in the code. Isnt the solution with two users just making things more complicated Is this kind of security really necessary p

Negative 12 pWe are currently implementing a new WCF REST service in IIS for our site and on a number of pages we may be making a handful of AJAX calls using JQuery asynchronously. The problem is that it seems as though WCF on the server side is executing synchronously.p  pOn page load were making 3 separate calls to 3 different methods.  Using logging, I can see them all hit the global.asax file within about 5ms of each other.  From there, the logging shows everything executing in the order they exit the global.asax not necessarily the order in which we made the calls from the page via javascript.  I expected each call to receive their own thread and return individually.

However, I couldnt get the End methods to call using his technique.  Im also starting to think Im going about this the wrong way.  Because looking at the logs, my custom authentication service is being executed before each service call, which happens before any async method operations even fire.  After further investigation, I took a look at the ThreadIds of each request coming into IIS and then executing the operations.  It appears that WCF is only using 1 worker thread... period.  It doesnt matter how many requests I send at a time to IIS.  For example, if I send 3 requests, I can see they all come in at different times within milliseconds of each other and all get their own thread.  But then it seems WCF just queues them all and executes them in that order because theyre all executed on the same thread, including the authentication service calls.p

Negative 12 pI have a publicly hosted svn repository on google code, however locally I switched to git because of various reasons. Im currently the only developer with access to the googlecode repo so no need to do fetches. All commits go via a dev branch, to the master branch to svn, with codegit svn dcommitcode. All well. Now im in the situation that Ive some files locally in version control with git, but I do not EVER want them to make public available.p  pSo I had an idea I create a directory private and add a svnignore private property to my svn repo. But than afterp  precodegit svn dcommmit codepre  pI get an error Merge conflict during commit File or directory . is out of date try updating resource out of date try updating at usrlocalgitlibexecgitcoregitsvn line 574p  pI tried importing the svnignore property into .gitinfoexclude but that excludes all my git files in the private from git which is definitely not what I want. p  p[08062011]p  pI think the error is not because of the svnignore, it seems that git svn completely ignore the svnignore, but due to some other yet unknown reason.

Negative 12 pThe only and imo very inconvenient caveat of codestdarraycode is that it cant deduce its size from the initializer list like builtin C arrays, its size must be passed as a template.p  pIs it possible to implement a stdarraylike container a thin wrapper around a builtin C array with a codeC11code initializerlistp  pI ask because, unlike stdarray, it would automatically deduce the size of the array from the initializer list which is a lot more convenient. For examplep  precode ilarray is the hypothetical container  automatically deduces its size from the initalizer list  ilarray ltintgt myarr  2, 4, 6, 7, 8  codepre  pWe would also want to provide a constructor to specify the size if an initializer list was not provided. For examplep  precode construct a fixed size array of size 10 ilarray ltintgt myarr2 10  codepre  pThis would also make the container more consistent with the other standard containers e.g. vector, deque and list.p  pTo the best of my knowledge it isnt possible as the wrapped Carray e.g. T elems [size], must have constant size and initializerlists size member function isnt constant.p  pAlso, I was wondering if was possible to implement such a container using a variadic template although from what Ive read I dont think its possible.p

Negative 12 pI have large number of UserControls that are very similar.   They share a lot of common behavior.  I been using a base class that has the common stuff and then specializing the class as needed. p  precodeclass BaseControl  UserControl       common     class RedControl  BaseControl      specialized   class BlueControl  BaseControl      specialized  codepre  petc ...p  pThis works fairly well until I needed to start inserting or changing the layout of the child controls contained in BaseControl.   For example RedControl needs to add a Button to a particular panel of the base control. In other case I need to change the size or layout of other base child controls. p  pWhen I tried the following code, I did not see any button at run time...p  precodepublic partial class RedControl  BaseControl    public RedControl        InitializeComponent      addButtonToBase   no button shows up      this.PerformLayout      void addButtonToBase        Button button   new Button     button.Anchor  System.Windows.Forms.AnchorStylesSystem.Windows.Forms.AnchorStyles.Top  System.Windows.Forms.AnchorStyles.Left     button.Location  new System.Drawing.Point3, 3     button.Size  new System.Drawing.Size23, 23     button.Text  My Button      baseSplitContainer.Panel1.Controls.Addbutton  protected child control in base       ...  codepre  pI emcanem make the button display as a child of baseSplitContainer if I make addButtonToBase virtual and manually add it to the generated code in InitalizeComponent of BaseControl.  The layout of BaseControl was still going on and you are permitted to call virtual functions in constructors in C.Net.... p  pSo even though it works, its not a nice solution.  For one thing, when I edit BaseControl in the VS designer, the call to addBaseControl in IntializeComponent gets removed, For another calling virtual functions in constructors feels dangerous. p  pI think I need to get the layout of the base control to happen again in the derived control... I tried that but either did it wrong or it wont work...p  pbtw yes I know WPF is good at this.  Cant use it because of constraints on other systems. p

But now Im thinking it is a bit dirty and I should not share these members because the MainWindow loses control over them. I was thinking I could create the collections of my structs in the Base class and make a method so I can read securely members of those collections in the MainWindow class, but my problem is with UI members. I could use signals and manage those members directly in the MainWindow class, but then I would have to duplicate a lot of code and it would complicate a bit the code changes, which is the main reason I decided to unify those methods in a class.p  pSo, my question is Is there any way to unify those methods without having to share members or using global variables because would have the same effect I would like to have those methods in a separated file.p  pThanks and greetingsp

Negative 12 pWhat happens is that I have a list of tags that needs to be refreshed using an ajax call.p  pI clean the codeltulgtcode containing the tags.br With the ajax response I populate the codeltulgtcode with codeltligtcodes of tags appending them with code.appendcodebr In my browser everything shows as expected, the new tags are there.br Then I click a save button and call a series of functions and beetwen those functions I try to make a codeserializeArraycode with the new tags but it doesnt work.   p  pThe logic for all of this is alright, since it works with the default tags, only when the tags gets refreshed with jQuery I cannot perform this operations.br I already checked that the refreshed tags have the same format as the default tags. p  pPlease, help.br Just one thing I cannot install more plugins.br My version of jQuery is 1.4.2br Thanks for your help.p

Negative 12 pIm confused as to how to accomplish this. I have a page which, has a popup filter, which has some input elements and an Apply button not a submit. When the button is clicked, two jquery .get calls are made, which load a graph, a DataTables grid, photos, and miscellaneous info into four separate tabs. Inside the graph, if one clicks on a particular element, the user is taken to another page where the data is drilled down to a finer level. All this works well.p  pThe problem is if the user decides to go back to the original page, but with the ajax generated graphgridphotos etc. Originally I thought that I would store a session variable with the filter variables used to form the original query, and on returning to the page, if the session var was found, the original ajax call would be made again, repopulating the tabs. p  pThe problem that I find with this method is that Coldfusion doesnt recognize that the session variable has been set when returning to the page using the browsers back button. If I dump out the session var at both the original and the second page, I can see the newly set var at the second page, and I can see it if I go to the original page through the navigation menu, but NOT if I use the back button.p  pSO.... from reading posts on here about ajax browser history plugins, it seems that there are various jquery plugins which help with this, including BBQ. The problem that I see with this approach is that it requires the use of anchor elements to trigger it, and then modifies the query string using the anchors href attributes. I suppose that I could modify the page to include a hidden anchor.p  pMy question, at long last is is an ajax history plugin like BBQ the best way to accomplish this, or is there a way to make Coldfusion see the newly created session var when returning to the page via the back button Or, should I consider rearchitecting the page so that the ajax calls are replaced by a form submission back to the page insteadp  pThanks in advance, as always.p  pEDIT some code to help clarify things Heres the button that makes the original ajax callsp  precodeltbutton idapplyFiltergtAPPLYltbuttongt  codepre  pand part of the js called on applyFilter, wrapped in document.readyp  precodeapplyFilter.clickfunction      fill in the Photos tab         .gettrackinglistPhotos.cfm,                              id id,                 randParam Math.random             ,             functionresponse                 tabsphotos.htmlresponse                            codepre  pFinally, when the user calls the drilldown on the ajax generated graph, it uses the MaintAction form which has been populated with the needed variablesp  precodefunction DrillDown      get the necessary variables and populate the form inputs     document.MaintAction.action  index.cfmfilesomepage.cfmampConfigsomeConfig     document.MaintAction.submit  codepre  pand that takes us to the new page, from which wed like to return to the first page but with the ajaxloaded photos.p

Negative 12 pI have built out a couple of keyboards for a touch aware app we are building in work. Since we use a controller that is aware of when the app is in touch screen mode I thought it would be nice if, in design mode, we could associate a control with a keyboard type and have the controller look after the calling of the keyboard.p  pOne of the things I do not want to do is to sub class each type of control just to add this property as I feel it is a very heavy for small gain. I had thought of using the tag property but it is not available in all controls due to use.p  pI was wondering if there is a way of attaching a property to a control on design time for the purpose of adding this meta data. So to recap I would like to be able to give each control a value that would be read by the controller to decide what keyboard to show. p

Negative 12 pSince I got some negative comments on my system design on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9946135accessingaprotectedmemberofasuperclasstypedmemberobjectanelegantsothisa question concerning the implementation of such system, I hope that if I present the problem I could get some better suggestions.p  pI am trying to design a modular application to be used for feature matching in video frames e.g. matching on very close frames of a movie or a video, like the product in a hrefhttpweb.cs.swarthmore.eduturnbullcs97f08papersivic03.pdf relnofollowthis articlea by Sivic, Zisserman.p  pThe idea is to allow for an easy switch between different emfeature detectionem algorithms as well as different emmatching proceduresem. Additionally, from my research, my understanding is that there is only a few basic matching procedures, while new matching methods mainly focus on additional pruning procedures for bad matches e.g. spatial consistency in the a hrefhttpweb.cs.swarthmore.eduturnbullcs97f08papersivic03.pdf relnofollowsame articlea. All the pruning procedures require for the initial matching to be done, and then do some additional work on the emextracted featuresem from the base and query images emcoupled by the matchingem, rejecting the bad matches.p  hr  pThe idea I had for the design is as followsp  ul liimplement a base interface codefeatureDetectorcodeli liall concrete feature detection algorithms inherit from codefeatureDetectorcode interface e.g. codesiftDetectorcodeli liimplement a base interface codefeatureMatchercodeli liall concrete matching methods inherit from the codefeatureMatchercode interface e.g. codeclass bruteForceMatchercode or wrappers for OpenCV matchers like codecvMatchercodeli liimplement a base interface codeimageMatchercode implementing a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStrategypattern relnofollowstrongStrategystronga pattern to allow for a choice of codefeatureDetectorcode and codefeatureMatchercodeli lifor all the matching pruning procedures, implement a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDecoratorpattern relnofollowstrongDecoratorstronga interface that inherits the base matching interface codeclass matcherDecorator  public imageMatchercodeli lieach additional pruning  filtering procedure implements the codematcherDecoratorcode interface e.g. codespatialConsistencyFiltercode and contains only the constructor with codeimageMatchercode as the only argument representing the component to be decoratedli ul  pThe problems pointed out to me in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9946135accessingaprotectedmemberofasuperclasstypedmemberobjectanelegantsothis questiona arise from the specific results of the feature detection and matching process, and they concern the emDecoratorem part of the design. Each codeimageMatchercode should hold emextracted featuresem from both of the images base and query, as well as the emmatches betweenem the extracted features. The internal representation of features is slightly different from the feature descriptors offered to the user via the public access function of codeimageMatchercodep  precodeclass imageMatcher     private  or protected         ...         ...         stdvector ltinternalFeatureDescriptorgt feats[2]              no more than 500  1000 features can be expected          stdvector ltstdpair ltint, intgt gt matches              size is the same order of magnitude as the number of features         ...     public         stdvector ltuserFriendlyFeaturesgt getFeaturesint baseOrQuery         const stdvector ltstdpairltint, intgt gt ampgetMatches         ...  codepre  pNow, since the feature vectors as well as the matches vector are quite heavy, I emwould not like to copyem them in to each one of the nested decorators filters when I use them. I do not have any problems with the codematchescode vector, since it offers a public interface for the user allowing the decorator access to the reference and omitting the need to copy the data. codefeatscode vectors, on the other hand, do not offer such an interface, and their access function requires me to do not only copying, but also recalculation of features internal representation. This in turn results in the need for the decorator to access emthe private or protected variables of the inner superclass pointerem.p  pI managed to grant my self access to the needed vectors without violating any privacy constraints I think Im not doing anything evil implementationaly, but it has been suggested that the very idea of accessing the private members of the superclass violates the idea of the emDecoratorem pattern.p  hr  pAll that said, I am interested in any suggestions about how to refactor my code, comments on my current implementation and anything else concerning the design of my application.p

Negative 12 pIve look at some of the answers to similar questions and they dont really seem to fit mine.p  pIm trying to incorporate a pattern from Entity Framework DbContextpage 90 and it doesnt seem to work.

I included the addedOrderDetailId variable, so that I could add it to the Watch and see when it changedp  pWhat Ive found is happening is that the OrderId of the added OrderDetail object which is 0 when the foreach loop is entered is being updated by entity framework to the OrderId of the Order object. This is happening at after the first iteration through the foreach loop when the first child entity is having its state changed to modified.   This means that all three children are being marked as modified. This is causing SaveChanges to try to update an entry into the database that doesnt exist.  p  pIf anyone else has had this problem, then I would be greatful for any advice as to get around this.  I will also have to deal with existing child objects being deleted, but I havent got around to this yet, so if anyone knows of a pattern for this, that would also be appreciated.p  pEditp  pAfter taking Slaumas advice and removing db.Orders.Addorder. I was able to move the call to db.Entryorder.State underneath the foreach loop.  This allowed me to loop through the loop and set the state of each OrderDetail object to modified for the existing ones and added for the added one.  I then simply had to assign the OrderId of the parent to the OrderId of the child and the update was successful. Ive also included the code that Ive used to delete child objects during the edit.  Im not sure how efficient this is, but it works.

Negative 12 pRecently I stumbled across that JavaScript allows you to pass an object or array as the key to an object parameter. exp  precodevar myType   NameMyType  var myObject   myObject[myType]  1 codepre  pwill make codemyObject[myType]code return code1code From looking further into this, it seems like internally the objects code.toStringcode method is being called and passed as the actual key. In the above example this actually breaks apart as that means what is really happening is codemyObject[[object Object]]code is being set, meaning that any standard object passed in would access the same key.p  pHowever, I decided to expand upon this by creating custom objects which would cause their code.toStringcode method to instead return their constructor. This would mean that it would return a unique key for each object type. Based on this, I created the following example of using this technique to create relatively clean implementation of a type parameterp  precodefunction Cat  function Dog   function AnimalPack      this.speech       this.size  0   AnimalPack[Cat]  function      var pack  new AnimalPack     pack.speech  mew     pack.size  2     return pack   AnimalPack[Dog]  function      var pack  new AnimalPack     pack.speech  bark     pack.size  4     return pack   AnimalPack.prototype.Speak  function      var speak  []     forvar i0 iltthis.size i          speak.pushthis.speech          return speak.join    var catparty  new AnimalPack[Cat] var dogparty  new AnimalPack[Dog] codepre  pIn this example codecatparty.Speakcode will return codemew mewcode and codedogparty.Speakcode will return codebark bark bark barkcode.p  pThis could be used with native JavaScript types as well String, Number, etc.p  pThis seems to work standard across all 5 major browsers chrome, firefox, ie, safari, opera.p  pI was wondering if there is some glaring flaw that I am not seeing in this technique, or if this is perhaps a valid way of implementing a type parameterp  pThanksp

Currently I have an exception system everything is converted to exception, even PHP triggered errors that is catch in a try block that contains every line of code of the framework and the user application.p  pIm treating errors such as controller not found or action not found like any other, for example unable to connect to the database. But I feel like the latter is somehow more an exception rather than a pretty common controller not found 404.p  pAlso currently Im using an error handling that pretty much copy the way MVC works in my framework, in the sense that when an error occurs I load a specific action and load a specific view file for each type of error. Im not using the MVC by MVC I mean all the mechanism that load a controller, run an action, load a model and views for the user application of my framework because an error in the MVC could cause an error to be triggered, which would try to manage it with the MVC which would trigger the same error again and then the MVC to be loaded again and so on in an infinite loop.p  pHow should I handle every error of my framework What are the best practice right nowp

Negative 12 pI am currently developing JSR268 portlets and using Liferay as my portal. I have read all the maven tutorials and posts about using the Tomcat plugin to deploy to Tomcat via the manager application. Unfortunately I dont believe this works with Liferay as it takes over the ROOT application thus removing the Tomcat Manager application. I would like to know if there is a way to deploy my portlet application via the Liferay deploy folder. Any help is appreciatedp
Negative 12 pI am developing a application that uses core data. In my application i would like every user to have the same database. So i want all of the devices to share the same core data objects.p  pIn order to do that synchronization I found a presentation on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5164878this answera that discussed this matter. In the presentation, it is suggested that I add attributes such as creationDate and modificationDate to every object in Core Data.p  pSo to do that, i tried to subclass NSManagedObject MyManagedObject in order to add those properties to every object in core data. I also made every NSManagedObject subclass I had generated automatically by the model subclass MyManagedObject.p  pThe problem is that the properties I added to the NSManagedObject subclass do not persist in the database. So when I close and reopen the application, creationDate becomes null.p  pHeres some of my code headerp  precodeinterface MyManagedObject  NSManagedObject property nonatomic, retain NSDate  modificationDate property nonatomic, retain NSDate  creationDate end codepre  pAnd heres the .m filep  precodeimplementation MyManagedObject synthesize modificationDate, creationDate voidwillSave      [super willSave]         self.modificationDate  [NSDate date]  voidawakeFromInsert      [super awakeFromInsert]     [self setCreationDate[NSDate date]]     [self setModificationDate[NSDate date]]  codepre  pAny help, directions or reading would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 12 pI have an application that has a main GUI with a menubar, and another fullscreen frame, which makes some parts of the main GUI appear in fullscreen exclusive mode. When I am in fullscreen mode, I would like to bind a dropdown menu from the menu bar as jpopupmenu.p  pSwing provides the function getPopupMenu in JMenu. This function seems to work fine at first glance. I can hover over the menuitems and move to and view the submenus. Hovering over the submenus does emphasize the submenus, hovering over a plain menuitem or radiobuttonmenuitem or checkboxmenuitem does not emphasize the item. However, I cant actually click on a menuitem. The keyboardshortcuts do actually work fine, though. The problem is essentially the same as presented on this forum where the problem is not solved, though p  pa hrefhttpwww.javaforums.orgnewjava16463jmenujpopupmenu.html relnofollowhttpwww.javaforums.orgnewjava16463jmenujpopupmenu.htmlap  pIf I add a JMenuItem after the menubar has been initialized and usedshown in the main GUI thus when switching to the fullscreen frame, the menuitem is actually clickable. This menuitem is in turn also clickable in the menubar of the main GUI. Executing getPopupMenu directly after initializing the jMenu does not change anything. Not using the fullscreen exclusivemode does also not change anything about the problem.p  h1Edith1  pIt seems I left out some important information Im testing the app on Mac OSX and using codeSystem.setPropertyapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar, truecodep  pTo make the menu bar use the native menubar.

Negative 12 pIm building an application that serves as a webbased file editor. Users can select a file they want to edit, then that file is retrieved from the server and shown in a field. The user can then edit the file, and eventually save it. p  pThis introduces a racecondition Im trying to solve. p  pThe clientside file is not always in sync with the serverside file. When a user opens a file that has already been opened and edited in another place, saving will overwrite any edits done by the other client. While this could be fixed using some form of merging, this is quite a bit outside the scope of this project.p  pWhen a user logs in on two different pcs or from two different browsers, and tries to open the same file twice, this can be detected using the session key. However, when a user opens a second tab, the session key will be identical. p  pCurrently I periodically ping the file say, every 2 seconds and check if the previous ping is about 2 seconds ago. if it is less than that minus some value accounting for lag there emmightem be two clients watching that file. This however breaks if a user quickly switches between a file and back, and is just plain ugly.p  pIs there a better, cleaner way of doing thisp  pIm using a Django backend, and a frontend that relies heavily on jQuery, so any functionality based on these two would have my preference.p  pSome relevant code is shown belowp  pFrom the clientside, periodically dinging the file serversidep  precodesetIntervalfunction     opened  input[namefile]checked, files.val     ifopened         .post.  opened  ding.errorfunction             alertSomething is awry.               , 2000 codepre  pFrom the serverside, handling these dingsp  precodedef dingrequest, userid, projectid, fileid     user  User.objects.getpkuserid     project  Project.objects.getpkprojectid     file  File.objects.getpkfileid      sessionkey  request.session.sessionkey      canclaim  file.lastseenopen  None or timezone.now  file.lastseenopen gt datetime.timedeltaseconds4     ismine  file.lastopenedby  sessionkey     isiffy  file.lastseenopen  None and timezone.now  file.lastseenopen lt datetime.timedeltaseconds1      if isiffy         return HttpResponsestatus409, contentFile is iffy     if canclaim or ismine         file.lastopenedby  sessionkey         file.lastseenopen  timezone.now         file.save         return HttpResponsestatus200, contentFile dingd     else         return HttpResponsestatus409, contentFile claimed by someone else codepre  pThe response 409 File is iffy is returned if it seems that the file is opened twice on the same keyp

Negative 12 pBoth instructions use static rather than dynamic dispatch. It seems like the only substantial difference is that codeinvokespecialcode will always have, as its first argument, an object that is an instance of the class that the dispatched method belongs to. However, codeinvokespecialcode does not actually put the object there the compiler is the one responsible for making that happen by emitting the appropriate sequence of stack operations before emitting codeinvokespecialcode. So replacing codeinvokespecialcode with codeinvokestaticcode should not affect the way the runtime stack  heap gets manipulated  though I expect that it will cause a codeVerifyErrorcode for violating the spec.p  pIm curious about the possible reasons behind making two distinct instructions that do essentially the same thing. I took a look at the source of the OpenJDK interpreter, and it seems like codeinvokespecialcode and codeinvokestaticcode are handled almost identically. Does having two separate instructions help the JIT compiler better optimize code, or does it help the classfile verifier prove some safety properties more efficiently Or is this just a quirk in the JVMs designp

Negative 12 pIve read through most of the posts that have to do with the async nature of AFNetworking.  But, my problem is a little unique and I could use some help.p  pIm starting a new async thread from a modal view controller that is supposed to tell the user that Im downloading content from a web server.  The idea is to download a bunch of files over 100 and its working great.  Ive even put retry counts into the downloads so that it will retry to download any file if it fails up to a maximum.  Everything is downloading great.  The problem is that I dont know when its done.  p  pAnd heres why I am download a list of JSON files.  Those JSON files define list of other JSON files which have lists of PDFs and other types of files.  Because of the nature of what Im downloading, I have to download it in sequence.  For instancep  ol liDownload file1.jsonli liGet list of JSON files from file1.json after its downloadedli liLoad each of these secondary JSON files subFile1.json, subFile2.json, etc.li liAfter a secondary JSON files downloads subFile1.json, I get a list of files to download from that JSON file subFile1.jsonli liDownload each of the files specified in the JSON subfile subFile1.json for exampleli ol  pSo my process looks hierarchical to insure parent files get downloaded before child files 1. Initial Download Method calls SubDownloadMethod2 ON SUCCESS within success block 2. SubDownloadMethod2 gets list from downloaded file and calls SubSubDownloadMethod3 3. SubSubDownloadMethod3 download PDF files and other files ON SUCCESS within success blockp  pSo as you can see, I have a dynamic number of files to download.  Hence I dont know how many files Ill be downloading up front.  Its made more difficult based on the fact that it can go down multiple levels and come from multiple directories on the web server.p  pI also do an recursive callback to each method if the download fails up to a max retry count which also makes it more difficult.p  pBecause each download starts its own thread Im assuming thats what AFNetworking is doing, Im not sure when all the downloads are done.  I dont know if the enqueueBatchOfHTTPRequestOperations might help.  I dont fully understand it and Im downloading from more than one directory on the web server.

Negative 12 pWe want to do a Facebook app for our brand page, where a form will be brought in from a secure domain that we own. But our finance department seems unwilling to allow this because of cross frame scripting attacks that are possible with iFrames.p  pMany big companies have apps inside FB and are collecting user data. I doubt FB would allow any code that would be insecure in this manner. I am looking for any site that talks about how FB manages such risks. What can we do to manage this risk on our end Isnt it true that if our content is coming from our own secure server, then FB just happens to be the emplaceem where we do out stuff, but the actual security lays with us p  pWould welcome any thoughts to counter our finance departments reservations, or even pointers to read up on this subject in detail. FBs own help is sparse on this matter. p  pThanks p

Negative 12 pIm working on a HTML 5 based web application, that will eventually be deployed to iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 possibly 7, toop  pOne part of the application involves the user selecting options from a codeselectcode drop down menu.p  pBecause these form elements arent very stylable, Ive come up with a solution where I have the CSS move the codeselectcode elements to an absolute position, 10000px from the top, so that they dont show up in the app.p  pThe app. then inserts an codeacode element in its place, which is styled to look like a simple block with the currently selected value written inside it.p  pWhen the user taps the codeacode element, Im using jQuery 2.0 to intercept the tap and set the focus to the codeselectcode element, thus bringing up the normal selection mechanism used in the web browser.p  pThis works flawlessly on iOS.

Negative 12 pIn my game I want to create seperate GLSL shaders for each situation. In example if i would have 3 models codecharactercode, codeshiny swordcode and codeblury ghostcode i would like to set coderenderShadercode, codeanimationShadercode and codelightingShadercode to the codecharactercode, then coderenderShadercode, codelightingShadercode and codespecularShadercode to codeshiny swordcode, and finally i would like to set coderenderShadercode, codelightingShadercode and codeblurShadercode to the codeblury ghostcode.p  pThe coderenderShadercode should multiply the positions of vertices by projection, world and other matrices, and its fragmet shader should simply set the texture to the model.p  pcodeanimationShadercode should transform vertices by given bone transforms.p  pcodelightingShadercode should do the lighting and codespecularLightingcode should do the specular lighting.p  pcodeblurShadercode should do the blur effect.p  pNow first of all how can i do multiple vertex transforms on different shaders Because the codeanimationShadercode should calculate the animated positions of vertices and then coderenderShadercode should get that position and trasform it by some matrices.p  pSecondly how can i change the color of fragments on different shaderp  pThe basic idea is that i want to be able to use different shaders for each sutuationseffects, and i dont know how to achieve it.p  pI need to know how should i use these shaders in opengl, and how should i use GLSL so that all shaders would complete each other and the shaders would not care if another shader is used or not.p

Negative 12 pIn the game that I am making I have a codeTimercode that I have set to code10000code thats every 10 seconds, right.p  pI use this codeTimercode to make an power up in the game only last for 10 seconds, the problem is that the Timer doesnt stop after the first time it have runned so the first time the player get that power up it will work fine but if the player get the same power up twice it wont have it for 10 second but depending on the codeTimercode the player will get it a random time as long as it isnt over 10 seconds. p  pWhat I need to do is making the codeTimercode stop right after it runs the first time so that it will start over again the next time the player get that power up. p  pHow would I do thisp

Negative 12 pI am trying to run an SSIS package from Sql Server Management Studio SSMS and get the following error upon execution. To run SSIS package outside of SQL Server Data Tools you must install Lookup of Integration Services or higher. This is odd because I have other SSIS packages that execute from SSMS with no problem. I am wondering if the problem is with the account running the SQL Server Agent Local System or if there is something else I am missing. I am running the 32 bit runtime and have created a sample package which reads data from an excel source into a flat file. This runs fine from SSMS, when I add a lookup table to the mix though it fails with the above error. p  pAny help is appreciatedp
Negative 12 pWe have a piece of software that is programmed against DirextX 7 SDK i.e the code uses  codeLPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7code and the likes and runs in fullscreen. The main task is putting something on the screen in response to external triggers in a reliable manner. This behaves very well on Windows XP bsically the software waits for some trigger and when triggered, creates a new frame, puts it in the backbuffer, then tells DX to flip the buffers. The result is the approximate delay between the trigger and when the frame is effectively shown on the screen is, depending on video card and drivers, 3 frames or 50mSec for a 60Hz screen. This is tested on a variety of systems, all running NVidia cards. On some systems with higher end cards we even get 2 frames.p  pWhen running the same software on Windows 7 with no other software installed at all however, we cannot get lower than 5 frames. Meaning somewhere in the pipeline the OS or driver or both eat 2 extra frames, which is near to unacceptable for the application. We tried disabling aerodesktop compositiondifferent driver versionsdifferent video cards but no avail.p  ul liwhere does this come from is this documented somewhereli liis there an easy way to fix I know DirectX 7 is old, but upgrading to compile agains a more recent version might be tons of work so another type of fix would be nice.

Negative 12 pMule 3.3.1 Community Edition.p  pI want to know if Im missing some simple configuration pattern in Mule that will allow me to do the following general type of process.  I want a message to come in from an inbound endpoint.  I then want to call out to some other endpoint, such as a routedetermination service, and, based upon the results of that outbound call, send the original message...unchanged...to a second outbound endpoint.p  pThe call out to the route service changes the original message.  Using constructs like wiretap seem to pose sequencing problems.  I can do it by copying all the headers and payload, but thats to tedious to code every time I need it and awkward to read.  I can do it quite simply by writing a custom transformer that sets a result variable back on the message.  p  pBut, is there some simple, pureMuleflow solution for this  It seems somewhat analogous to the rationale for the httpproxy pattern construct, not having to copy all the inbound stuff to outbound manually.p

All the apache does is take the host name and forward the request to the proper tomcat server, which handles everything thereafter.p  pI am looking to setup SSL on one of the domains and I understand the process of how to do so but I am confused on whether I should be allowing tomcat to handle all SSL or apache.p  pWhat is the difference Any downsides to allowing tomcat to handle the ssl If I let apache handle the ssl will I still get green bar, padlock etc when I access the tomcat app Im a little confused about the whole situation.p  pI use a proxy to handle apache2 forwarding to the proper tomcat app. If I setup the proxy like sop  precodeltVirtualHost 1.2.3.4443gt     ServerName host.domain.org      ltProxy gt         Order deny,allow         Allow from all     ltProxygt      SSLEngine on     SSLProxyEngine On     SSLCertificateFile etcapache2sslcertificate.crt     SSLCertificateKeyFile etcapache2sslcertificate.key      ProxyRequests Off     ProxyPreserveHost On     ProxyPass  httpslocalhost8443     ProxyPassReverse  httpslocalhost8443 ltVirtualHostgt codepre  pWill I need to use https and port 8443 Doing it this way wont I also have to setup SSL on tomcat Or can I use the following in the connector of tomcats server.xmlp  precodesecure  false scheme  https proxyName  www.mydomain.com proxyPort  443 codepre  pAnd not worry about connecting tomcat to the ssl keys Is this the proper way to secure a tomcat app using SSL through apache2p

Negative 12 pI am using a loop to display custom field values in a navigation area. Example I have 100 posts on the page. Each post has a Brand associated with it Fender, Gibson, etc. maybe about 15 brands overall. The navigation loop will output the Brand custom field value for the posts. I want it to only show a brand once, so that instead of outputting 100 Brand values, the loop only outputs 15 unique values, with no duplicates. Everything google shows me about preventing duplicates has to do with wanting a second loop not to duplicate anything from the first loop. This is not my issue  I simply want to prevent duplicate output in a single loop.

Negative 12 pWe have a system built that exports invoices to an IIF file format so the client can import the invoices and all the invoice line items into QuickBooks.p  pThis same system allows the client to export credit memos to an IIF format so those can be imported into QuickBooks as well.p  pThe default behavior is that the credit is applied to the customer account and not necessarily to a specific invoice.  They want to apply the credit to the invoice and to do that they go in to QuickBooks after the import and then associate them together. Unfortunately, the IIF format doesnt appear to support this directly according to a hrefhttpsupport.quickbooks.intuit.comsupportArticlesHOW12778 relnofollowhttpsupport.quickbooks.intuit.comsupportArticlesHOW12778ap  blockquote   pImported IIF files do not create links between transactions. When you   import an invoice and a payment for the invoice, they are not linked   after the import. You must link them, and all other pairs, in the   Receive Payments window or Pay Bills window. If you need an import   solution that links transactions, refer to the Intuit Marketplace for   thirdparty developers.p blockquote  pSo can anyone recommend a solution Or should we recommend the client finally move away from the .IIF file and start using the QuickBooks Web Connector Is there support for this in therep  pThanks p

Negative 12 pI am having an issue I can not figure out.  I created an SSIS package that uses a SQL command to retrieve data from Server2.  The query is very simple, however, it references a view in a join.  If I execute the SSIS package manually on Server1, it retrieves 925 rows and inserts it into the appropriate table in Server1. The problem starts when I schedule this SSIS package to run nightly.  It succeeds on the first step truncating the table on Server1 in preparation for retrieving the rows from Server2, but, when I look at the table, there are 0 rows.  When I modify the Query to remove the join that references a view getting undesired results, the scheduled SSIS works perfectly, although the recordset I get back is not what I wanted, because I need that JOIN.  I dont see how it can be a permissions issue as it works fine without the VIEW.  Is there something Im missing  Thanks for the help.p  pThe following query works only if I execute the SSIS manually  FilteredAccount is a VIEW It should return over 900 rows and does if I run manually, but returns 0 if executing the SSIS via Agent.p  precodeSELECT B.epccosmid, A.consultant, A.region FROM Consultant2TC AS A JOIN FilteredAccount AS B ON A.consultant  B.epcserviceconsultantidname codepre  pIf I change the query to the one below  in the SSIS package and schedule it, it works finep  precodeSELECT A.consultant, A.region FROM Consultant2TC AS A codepre

Negative 12 pMan, I just cant figure this out. This is the damndest thing. In IE9, the background gradient seems to disappear, seemingly at random, depending on the width of my element.p  pJust to start off, heres a test link that you can view. p  pa hrefhttpbabackofficedev.radolo.comTestButtons.aspx relnofollowhttpbabackofficedev.radolo.comTestButtons.aspxap  pWhats also weird is that it doesnt happen in JS fiddep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjmillspaysbillsn833q relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjmillspaysbillsn833qap  pI think Ive narrowed down the culprit, but I just cant figure out WHY this is happening. The issue seems to be the codebackgroundsizecode property. On my buttons with a gradient, I give it  codebackgroundsize 1px 175code, then on hover codebackgroundsize 1px 100code  this basically allows a smooth transition on chrome, firefox, etc. instead of an instant transition to a different gradient. Anyway, that all works fine.p  pI dont plan on changing this, because this is only effecting IE9, but I would love to know why its happening so that I can try to figure out a workaround. p  pAfter some investigating, Ive found that this only happens on certain widths. It just so happens that a word I was using role was the perfect width for this to happen, which is how I figured this out.p  pDoing some testing, Ive found that it happens at the following widths 43px, 49px, 57px, 63px, 84px, 85px, 96px, 99px, 109px  That was as far as I got. Im sure this happens above 109px, but I havent tested above 110px.p  pI just dont get it. I cant seem to figure this out. Has anyone ever had this issue Can anyone give me some input Its driving me crazy.p

Negative 12 pi have a problem with clustering time series in R. I googled a lot and found nothing that fits my problem.p  pI have made a STLDecomposition of Timeseries.

I found some functions that imply one of these aspects but not both.p  pFirst i tried to calculte a distance matrix with the dtwdistance so i found clusters based on the values and inply the time shift but not on the shape of the timeseries. After this i tried some correlation based clustering, but then the timely shift were not recognized and the result dont satisfy my claims.p  pIs there a function that could cover my problem or have i to build up something  on my own.

It should be a simple click function here, I really dont know why this isnt working.p  pEDIT Sorry for the lack of relevant material. First time poster here. The problem is that the click function is not firing when I click on my TopBlock div. It is supposed to trigger some javascript code that will increase the dimensions of my Expansion div, but I just want the alert to pop up first to ensure that its working.p

Negative 12 pIn Eclipse codeFile Searchcode you have the possibility to search for containing text and filter the result with Filename patterns. For example if you search for codesetValueint xcode with filename pattern My.java you will find the codesetValueint xcode method in a File named codeMyGame.javacode, but not in a file named codeYourGame.javacode. Now i need a way to filter the search to only show results in a specific method. For example if i have 10 classes which override a codeinitcode method and a coderesetcode method of the same superclass. Inside the codeinitcode and the coderesetcode the codesetValueint xcode gets called. Now i want to search for all occurences of codesetValueint xcode, but only inside the codeinitcode methods. Is there a way to do this With regular expression maybe or does Eclipse have such a method Thanksp

Negative 12 pI am attempting to use the easyDropDown.js add on to style my drop boxes but I have encountered an issue. My drop box is not statically created. When the webpage is loaded an array is used to append the drop down list. This drop box appears on multiple pages of my website and I am attempting to set it up so that when the user makes a selection on one page, that selection carries to every page.p  pHeres a step by step playthrough of what the code is doingp  pWhen the page is started it appends the easyDropDown list so that all the values are there.p  precodehomeSelectSite.empty  s   s  ltoption valuesitegtSiteltoptiongt for var i  0 i lt Sites.length i       s  s  ltoption value  Sites[i].SiteID  gt  Sites[i].SiteID     Sites[i].SiteName  ltoptiongt  homeSelectSite.appends codepre  pNote Sites is the array that I am using to fill the drop box.p  pNow once the drop box list has been created I need to set what value is selected. This value is set in the sessionStorrage if the user has made a selection on another page.p  precodehomeSelectSite.easyDropDown var selectedSite  sessionStorage.getItemCurrentSiteID if selectedSite  undefined ampamp selectedSite  null      homeSelectSite.valselectedSite  codepre  pSo what the code is doing is this emptying the current drop box, appending it with new values, styling it with easyDropDown, and finally setting the selected value. For some reason this will not work. The appending and styleing are working just fine but it will not allow me to set the selected value. I have also tried using thisp  precodehomeSelectSite.easyDropDownselect, selectedSite codepre  pIs there a reason why I cannot set the selected value This all works if I remove everything related to easyDropDown.p

Negative 12 pI am following this guide a hrefhttpopen.gl relnofollowhttpopen.gla to learn how to program using modern opengl. I am stuck at one thing.

Negative 12 pI am setting up an Ecwid shop in my website.p  pThere is this SKU string input field in which we are supposed to declare a name for our SKU string. We simply input our string in the input field.p  pInstead of using 1 word for the SKU, I want it to be 2 phrases, so my SKU string would be like thisp  blockquote   pyellow and blue, red and blackp blockquote  pHowever, I want the SKU to be shown in the website with a line break. So it would be like this in the websitep  blockquote   pyellow and blue,p      pred and blackp blockquote  pIt seems we cannot input code in the input field, it looks just like plain text. Maybe Im not trying the corret code for the break line, but it seems that I must do something else to achieve this.p  pHowever, we do have the ability to create custom CSS for the SKU. But I do not know how to use the CSS to add a break line to the SKU string.p  pThe default codes for the SKU are the followingp  blockquote   p Product sku p      pdiv.ecwidproductBrowsersku p      pfont normal 13px tahoma, geneva, verdana, sansserifp      pcolor 1e2c38p      pwordwrap breakwordp      pp      pspan.ecwidproductBrowserskuvalue p      pdisplayinlineblockp      pp blockquote  pAny ideas of customizing the CSS code or maybe inputing a code in the string field so the string has a break linep  pPlease do help, Ive contacted Ecwid team but they are taking too long.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 12 pI have been writing a program that spawns a child process, and calls codewaitpidcode to wait for the termination of the child process.

After the codewaitpidcode call returns, strongthis file exists and is generated correctlystrong which means the segfault occurs somewhere in another destructor, or somewhere outside of my control.p

Negative 12 pAs in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3177584this questiona, Id like to find the chain of codeincludecodes by which a particular definition winds up being incorporated into my CC file. For example, suppose codemain.ccode contains this codep  precodeinclude ltmath.hgt int main      double d  exp0     return 0  codepre  pthen on my system fairly standard Linux, codemath.hcode includes codebitsmathcalls.hcode which is where codeexpcode is declared. So I would like to run some sort of analysis on codemain.ccode and get output likep  precodeexp  main.c  math.h  bitsmathcalls.h codepre  pThe formatting is irrelevant, I just want the complete chain of included files from where codeexpcode is used to where it is declared. Is there some Linuxcompatible tool which I can use to do thisp  pThe question I linked above gives a way to do it in Visual Studio, but that doesnt work for me for obvious reasons. I do use Kdevelop, so if I can do it in that program, that will be fine, or some command line tool would be good as well.p

Negative 12 pI am developing a java API. During my development, I keep facing the following issuep  pI have two classes in two different packages. Class A in package x, and class B in package y. I need the class A to access a method M defined in class B. Hence, the modifier that should be used for the method M is codepubliccode. However, I do not want to allow the developer who will use my API in hisher java application to access the method M. The problem is that the method M has a codepubliccode modifier as I mentioned, and hence anyone can access it within the API or from outside the API. At the same time, if I decrease the modifier level of the method M to codeprotectedcode or codeprivatecode, the class A will not be able to access the method M because it belongs to a different package. How can I solve this problem Is my only solution to have A and B in the same packagep

Negative 12 pI am having some trouble storing arima predictions into an empty vector. The problem is arima predictions give you predictions and standard errors. There are two columns of values.

Negative 12 pI have been having problem with an app which uses both java and C and OpenCV which appears to be very inconsistent in the amount of time it takes to perform various tasks. To help diagnose this, I made a function in java called codeoneoffspeedtestcode which did nothing but a series of integer maths problems in a loop that takes about half a second, and then prints the time taken to the log. If I call this function repeatedly from within codeonCreatecode then the time taken for each call is very consistent  3, but if I call it from within codeonCameraFramecode, a function that OpenCV calls when it has an image ready from the camera, then the time taken for the maths test in each fram varies by anything up to a factor of two. I decided to try the execution sampler in eclipseDDMS and see if I could work out what was happening. I saw that when I clicked on codeoneoffspeedtestcode, it listed the parents and children of that function, along with a line saying strongcontext switchstrong. Then on that row, under a column labelled strongIncl Real Timestrong, it says 66. Now Im not very expert in using DDMS, and I only have a hazy idea about context switching, but from the description so far, does it look like I have a problem with context switching taking up a lot of time Or am I misunderstanding the DDMS output.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMKKZP.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 12 pI plan to have a multi data center Cassandra 2 setup with 24 nodes per data center and several 10s of data centers. We have keyspaces replicated on a certain number of nodes on each data center. We have a vnode based deployment. So tokens should get assigned to the nodes automatically.p  pDocumentation at a hrefhttpwww.datastax.comdocumentationcassandra2.0cassandraoperationsopsaddnodetoclustert.html relnofollowhttpwww.datastax.comdocumentationcassandra2.0cassandraoperationsopsaddnodetoclustert.htmla suggests that addition of new node requires cleanup to be run on all other nodes of the cluster. However, it does not clarify the procedure in a multidata center setup.p  pMy understanding is that nodetool cleanup removes data which no longer belongs to that node. When a new data center is being setup, we are creating completely new replicas and AFAICT, it does not result in data movementrebalance outside of this new data center and hence there is no cleanup requirement on nodes of other data centers. Is someone able to confirm if my understanding is right, and cleanup is not required on nodes of other data centersp

Negative 12 pIn my project, CRC32 is calculated very many times. I have used software CRC32 calculation until now. But I noticed there is CPU support in SSE4.2 and linux also provides the hardware CRC32 calculation function using the CPU instruction. I use Intel Xeon E52650 CPU so I tried to calculate CRC32 by using the linux function. But the result is different with software CRC32 function that I used. I used init value 127 in the both.

Negative 12 pIm working on a small C videogames library for the Raspberry Pi.

Easy.p  pFor keyboard reading, I saw some examples that reconfigure stdin to ONONBLOCK using fcntl, then save and reconfigure keyboard termios attibutes ICANON, ECHO, and some example also save and reconfigure keyboard mode with ioctl. Whats the point of doing all that stuff instead of just reading devinputevent0 inputevents same way as mousep  pNote that I undestand what those functions do, I just dont undestand why should be better to do all that stuff instead of just reading inputevents.p

Negative 12 pI am reading Data from a serial port using the codeDataReceivedcode event. While receiving data, I am making interpolations on the data and showing them in a PictureBox in real time. Everything works fine and I can see the interpolated heatmap data in the PictureBox great and quickly. But the problem is while data is being read, the WinForms application freezes, the form cant even apply the codeFormPaintcode event. The codeDataReceivedcode event gets data, interpolates it, and applies this to the PictureBox.

Because when I comment in it, the formpaint event works too. But for the best results we cant sacrifice the data amount and quality. As I said, right now it gets the data, interpolates and draws quickly, but the only problem, is it locks all other functions in main thread I guess. This might be solved by threading but I am new on threads and a little confused. So I cant go further.p  pAny ideas how to move forwardp

If I reject a request, is it necessary to use blank data and end handlers to read the request body or can I just send the response, a 401, and leave the request unreadp  pIt seems that if I leave the response unread then I get occasional The existing connection has been forcibly closed by the remote host errors at the client.  Adding code to wait for the request body to be read does seem to fix the issue but then again, adding delays at various points in the server code also seems to have a beneficial effect.  It can be hard to tell with an intermittent fault.p  pThe coffeescript code that emseemsem to fix the issue isp  precode res.writeHead status, message, headers  req.on data, d gt   wait for request to be completely read before ending response stream  req.on end, gt res.end codepre  pThe empty data handler is required to get the end event and the end event is empossiblyem required to avoid the error at the client.  Given that the request body might be megabytes is this the best way to send a 401 response or is there a better way that doesnt require reading the whole request.p

Negative 12 pIve been working on a Qt C application that deals with video processing.

Negative 12 pI have studied the following 2 questions, both asking exactly what I am askingp  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.appcelerator.comquestion117432keepsearchbaratthetopofthetableviewwhenscrolling relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.appcelerator.comquestion117432keepsearchbaratthetopofthetableviewwhenscrollinga p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.appcelerator.comquestion10611addingtableviewbeneathsearchbar relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.appcelerator.comquestion10611addingtableviewbeneathsearchbarap  pThe problem is, there is no confirmed and correct answer given on either question. Solutions are suggested and followup comments always say that didnt work. The one exception, where a comment says that works perfectly, seems to be referring to an answer that doesnt use a search bar at all, and seems pointless. So Im just looking for a good approach to keeping the search bar visible even when scrolling down through the table rows. I have hundreds of rows in my table. The table loads fast, the rows scroll fine, and the search works perfectly. The only problem same as in the other 2 posts is that the moment you start scrolling down in the table, the search bar scrolls up out of site. Im amazed that the default behavior is for the searchbar to disappear as soon as you scroll. Its hard to imagine anyone wanting that behavior ever. Here is my codep  precodevar searchbar  Ti.UI.createSearchBar     showCancel true,     top 5   var movies  Ti.UI.createTableView     data movieData,     top 30,     height 75,     search searchbar,     hideSearchOnSelection false  codepre

Negative 12 pI am currently working on a company website. Ive used negative margins plus positive padding to make the footer and top bars fill the 100 width of the page even though they are contained within another div, the wrapper set at about 65. This is, as far as I know, a relatively well known way to do it but causes that content to go beyond the sides of the page. p  pAnyway, in order to prevent sideways scrolling theres xoverflow hidden on both the html and body. This works when Im at my computer but when I was showing the website to my coworkers today it was not working. I had my laptop connected to a large TV through an HDMI cable and I was able to scroll to the side no scroll bar, just able to with a three button mouse. Went back to my normal setup same laptop with a second monitor attached and I can no longer scroll. p  pCode is something like thisp  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idwrappergt  ltdiv classextendgt   This is the div extending beyond the page and causing sideways scroll.   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precodehtml   overflowx hidden   body   overflowx hidden   .extend   paddingleft35  marginleft35  paddingright35  marginright35    wrapper   width65  margin0 auto  codepre  pThis isnt a super huge issue for me unless I discover it happens in more cases.

These are only a handful of examples and expected outcomes that fail to performp  ul liDeclaring service in the Manifest doesnt allow it to be run via codestartWakefulServiceContext, Intentcode methodli liChanging the class name of an already declared it doesnt work either receiver doesnt cause the application to crash on launch if Manifest would work it should crash due to ResourceNotFoundli liThere is a declaration of a receiver that isnt present in the project my coworker didnt commit it to the repository and it also doesnt crash the application.li ul  pIve tried so many things that I dont want to list them, Ill keep browsing through your answers and hopefully find something I havent tried.p  pThe code itself works. Ive copypasted it in another project and everything works okay. Also in the original application everything works except for the parts that are handled by the Manifest.p  pEDIT Forgot to add, although it is implied  this is a collab project on a repository. All the conflicts have been resolved.p

Negative 12 pIm trying to free a struct and am having trouble with it. What Im programming is kind of an nary tree or a virtual file system. I have 2 different structs one for folders and one for files and an array for each struct where every element is stored. The structs have a member ID and Ive made so I can get a filefolder by using Folders[ID], which will return the struct with that ID. The problem I have is deleting  freeing them.

Negative 12 pTitle says it all more or less. When I need an for the sake of this example integer array for an unknown amount of values I know I can change its size using codenew array  new int[size]code. Now my question is If I have an array of a certain size, but I need to make it bigger, can I just use the new operator to expand it and will it still have all previously stored elements or would it be smarter to create a whole new array with a dynamic size, copy all elements from the previous array into the new one and codedelete[]code the old array. Basically just swapping between the two arrays, whenever I need a new size.p  pSpecifically I am asking whether or not this piece of code would work in the way its intended to workp  precodeforint i  1 i lt 10 i int array  new int[i] array[i1]  i  codepre  pMy assumption is that this array will first be the size of 1 and store the value 1 at index 0. Then it will reallocate its size to 2 and store the value to at index 1 and so on until i is 9.p  pI guess to rephrase my question a bit better Does an array initialized with new have to be populated with elements or will it copy the elements it had from before using the operatorp
Negative 12 pGoogle mentioned in their Android blog that there are two possibilities if one wants to use the new codeToolbarcode using codeAppCompatcode. One is by using it as an codeActionBarcode and one using it standalone, but as I am using codeActionBarDrawerTogglecode, I need the first option. So I have to extend codeActionBarActivitycode and my theme must inherit codeTheme.Appcompatcode or one of its variations. Also, to use the first option I had to inherit the codeNoActionBarcode variation. And finally, I had to call codesetSupportActionBarmToolbarcode, which I did. However, the ActionBar still does not show.

Negative 12 pI have a seat reservation page on my web site. The page uses an UpdatePanel to refresh the seats status every 5 seconds with a SQL query. That way the users should be able to see when someone else reserves a seat. p  pThe problem is that when multiple users access the page, the whole web site will bug out. I believe it is losing the conneciton to the database, and i have to restart the server for it to come back online. The reservation page is the only page on the whole site that is causing this issue. p  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 12 pwhat Im trying to do is to find the sum of 1mod,2mod,3mod....nmod. What Im doing is that there is no effect in taking modulo if n lt mod1 so I summed up all the numbers up to mod1 then after n  mod this cycle repeats again.so the answer will be nmodsum of first mod1 natural numbers if n is even.Consider the n is odd,my doubt is here and if n is odd then the procedure described above will leave some numbers left which also has to be summed up to reach the answer.Im failing here,what is wrong in my solution...

Negative 12 pIm pretty much brand new to the world of VBA and so far, its been an uphill battle.

Negative 12 pI am creating a hex to binary converting functions in c with a little efficiency in mind, and as iostreams hex specifier does not work for chars , I decided to use sscanf. It reads from one vector and writes into another vector. The problem is, that in one of the cases, the program is extremely slow. this is the example It copies a 260000 character string into the vector in And then in the loop two hex characters from the input are converted into one byte in the output.p  pThe string is in the file key.h. it has something like thisp  precodeconst char key 6e7fdb71e32c5f8420100028201010.... 260000 characters more ... codepre  p,p  precodeinclude ltcstringgt include ltvectorgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  262150 kilobyte file, constainig a large string, assigned to the variable key include key.h  hex to bin conversion demo int main      stdvectorltchargt in     stdvectorltchargt out      output buffer size is half of the input buffer size     out.resizestrlenkey2      read hex string into vector     in.insertin.begin,ampkey[0],ampkey[strlenkey]      for unsigned int bi  0 bi lt in.size2 bi   if 0   this version is VERY slow         const char ptr  ampin[2bi] else   but not this         char ptr[2]         memcpyptr,ampin[2bi],2 endif         sscanfptr, 2hhX, ampout[bi]       codepre  pNow the problem In this state the program gives following resultsp  precodetime .test  real    0m0.024s user    0m0.024s sys 0m0.000s codepre  pChanging if 0 to if 1 and... magicp  precodetime .test  real    0m0.611s user    0m0.610s sys 0m0.001s codepre  pIt is 25 times slower.

Negative 12 pI have an object containing cyclic references. According to the XStream Json documentation, cyclic references are NOT supported, and one should therefore use a hrefhttpxstream.codehaus.orggraphs.html relnofollowthe NOREFERENCES XStream modea when marshalling an object to Jsonp  blockquote   pWhat limitations has XStreams JSON supportp      pJSON represents a very simple data model for easy data transfer.   Especially it has no equivalent for XML attributes. Those are written   with a leading  character, but this is not always possible without   violating the syntax e.g. for array types. Those may silently   dropped and makes it therefore difficult to implement   deserialization. References are another issue in the serialized   object graph, since JSON has no possibility to express such a   construct. You should therefore always set the NOREFERENCES mode of   XStream. Additionally you cannot use implicit collections, since the   properties in a JSON object must have unique names.p blockquote  pBut I tried setting the mode to IDREFERENCES and it appears as though the Object is marshalled emwithem references, and the object can be unmarshalled properly. Is the XStream documentation simply outdated, or have I simply inadvertently created the object graph in such a way that I havent hit any of the limitationsp  pSorry, but I cant post my exact graph as an example as it contains applicationdomainspecific code and it might take some time to construct a clean alternative.p

What I am trying to do is when a new packet is received I want to read the ID from the buffer and then create an instance of that certain packets class to read and store all the data for later use.  My problem is Im not sure how to go about creating an instance of the class based on the ID. My first thought was just an codeEnumcode that held the ID of the packet and reference to their class.p  precodepublic enum Packets      HANDSHAKE0, HandshakePacket.class,     HEARTBEAT1, HeartbeatPacket.class,      etc  codepre  pI would then call a get method with the packets ID.p  precodepublic static BasePacket getint id      for Packets packet  Packets.values          if packet.getId  id              return BasePacket packet                    return null  codepre  pThis worked rather well, but Im still curious if there is possibly a better way to do this One of my thoughts was to use the codeFactory designcode pattern but Im unsure how to implement for something like this or if its even needed.p

Negative 12 pSo I have a simple OpenGL viewer where you can draw any number of boxes that the user wants.  Ive also added the ability to take a PNG or JPG image and texture map it to a primitive.  p  pI want to be able to have the user specify any of the cubes on the screen and apply different textures to them.  Im fairly new to OpenGL.  Right now I can easily map an image to a single primitive, but Im wondering whats the best way to map 2 seperate images which may be different sizes to 2 separate primitives. p  pIve done a fair amount of reading up on 2D Texture arrays and it would seem this would be the way I wanna go since I can store multiple textures in one texture unit, but Im not sure if this is possible considering what I mentioned above.  If the images are both different dimensions then I dont think I can do this at least I dont think so.  I know I can just store each image into separate texture units but doing it in an array seemed like the cleaner way to do it.p  pWhat would be the best way to do this  Can you in fact store different size images into a 2d texture array And if so how Or am I better off just storing them on separate texture unitsp

This happens when the activity is already existing and I send it a intent after it has been moved back in the history stack, by using the kbdHomekbd button.p  pFirst, if I press the kbdHomekbd button when on my activity, then switch the screen off and on, the activity is expected to be displayed right away as it was. However what is displayed instead is the basic android lockscreen. My activity is behind.p  pWorst, sometime, if I touch the home screen, then turn the screen off and on, the home screen overlay all appli logo and widgets are displayed with my activity in the backgroundp  pThe intent I am using each time the screen is turned off to laucn and recall the activity p  precodeintent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP  Intent.FLAGACTIVITYSINGLETOP  Intent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK  Intent.FLAGACTIVITYNOANIMATION context.startActivityintent codepre  pSo, it seems that when my activity is in the history stack, it sometimes does not correctly get recalled and bypass the android lockscreen. Is there something wrong with my intentp
Negative 12 pI have a redirect issue occurring, So far, Ive redirected all nonwww to www, and an old domain to the new domain.

Negative 12 pHello I have been coding in JavaScript that is part of the Adobe Acrobat DC software. I want to program a pdf that can open up until an expiration date. I have figured out how to write this but the time is local to the computer which can be changed. I want to be able to call to a NTP server to get the time from it. The NTP server as I have read is a TCPIP Protocol that transports packets from http.p  pI can connect to the server right now but do not know how to parse through to extract the time. Here is what I havep  papp.launchURLa hrefhttptimed.nist.gov relnofollowhttptimed.nist.gova,false false to open the browser in a windowp  pmaybe var time  new datep  ptime        value from the server that is openp  pIs there a way with just normal JavaScript No Jquery, AJAX, .js, etc. to extract the date from a NTP server. I would prefer it in the Adobe syntax if that is possible though. Thank you so muchp

A few months back, in the Podfile, I had this single linep  precodepod ADALiOS, gt 1.0.1 codepre  pand everything worked fine when I defined a Bridging Header that includedp  precodeimport ADALiOSADAuthenticationContext.h codepre  pFinally, in my Swift code, all I need is to addp  precodeimport ADALiOS codepre  pBut I also wanted to start using SwiftyJSON, which is a Swift framework, so I added a couple of lines to my Podfilep  precodepod ADALiOS, gt 1.2.4 pod SwiftyJSON useframeworks codepre  pUpdating to CocoaPods V0.38 allowed to use frameworks with the ObjectiveC libraries ADALiOS. According to the documentation, there is no need for a Bridging header anymore, so I removed it.p  pNow, everything compiles fine, but when I invoke the ADAL code, it fails with the following errorp  precodeADALiOS [20150809 130107  C621BB01686A40649455A4B55C11E0E8]  ERROR Error raised 18.

Please read the ADALiOS readme on how to build your application with ADAL provided authentication UI resources..  ErrorCode 18. codepre  pI assume because it compileslinks fine that this is not related to the bridging header but something else. p  pAny cluep

Negative 12 pI have a set of remote processes that do lengthy computations and may reuse each others results. Each process will try to reuse as much as possible, therefore it will select from the DB to see whether another process has already done that computation. Possible scenarios to considerp  ol liThe computation with idx has not yet been done and process A does it.li liThe computation with idx has been done and process A will reuse it.li liThe computation with idx has not yet been done but a process B is already doing it so A will wait.li liProcesses A and B try both at the strongexact same timestrong to be granted access to do the computation with idx but only one should be allowedli ol  pThe problem is that using transactions and isolation levels to cover this is not sufficient or too complex e.g. each process would have its own view and duplicate computations may be possible and all but one process will fail to update the cache.p  pA simple cache table could be defined asp  precodeCREATE TABLE mycacheid int, input1 double, result double, updating timestamp codepre  pI have a solution based on stored procedures i.e. when the process wants to do the computation it will invoke this procedurep  precode  CREATE PROCEDURE updatecachestartcacheid INT   BEGIN      DECLARE myLockName VARCHAR100 DEFAULT CONCATCacheLock, cacheid      DECLARE myUpdating TIMESTAMP      DECLARE myNow DATETIME DEFAULT NOW      DECLARE myResult BOOL       get hold of the lock, at most one thread can get in       IF GETLOCKmyLockName, 1 THEN          check whether another thread has already started the computation         SELECT updating  FROM mycache WHERE idcacheid INTO myUpdating         IF myUpdating IS NULL THEN             the current thread may take over the computation             UPDATE test SET updatingmyNow WHERE idcacheid         ELSE             another thread has already started doing the computation             SIGNAL SQLSTATE 55555 SET MESSAGETEXT  Cache is marked as being updated by another process         END IF         SET myResult  RELEASELOCKmyLockName      ELSE          another thread got hold of the lock first         SIGNAL SQLSTATE 55555 SET MESSAGETEXT  Cache is currently being updated by another process      END IF   END codepre  pThis I think will cover all the scenarios. In the worstcase I will have one lock per row in that table. Are MySQL locks a limited resource is there another alternative solution e.g. using codeselect ... for updatecode but it gets a bit more complex depending on the isolation level used etc.p
Negative 12 pI have a three buttons that dynamically generate three slightly different forms. Im having trouble creating two way data binding. The binding becomes the same for each form for example if I add forms A, B and C and enter a comment in the comment field on form A, that comment will appear also on forms B and C. What Im trying to do is that each form will have their own values, so if I enter a comment in form A this comment will only appear in that instance of form A. If I add another form A and enter a different comment there it shouldnt appear anywhere else but this second instance of form A.p  pIve created this plunker with my exampleproblem a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit6S4fdJ6OQuOqJPFmH9yxppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedit6S4fdJ6OQuOqJPFmH9yxppreviewap  pControllerp  precodeangular.modulemyApp .controllerMainCtrl, [scope, MainFactory, function scope, MainFactory      var ctrl  this     var frmCnt  0     var dayCnt  1      scope.iti  MainFactory      var forms  [       frm1.html,       frm2.html,       frm3.html     ]      ctrl.displayedForms  []      ctrl.addForm  functionformIndex        ctrl.displayedForms.pushforms[formIndex]       console.logctrl.displayedForms.length           ctrl.deleteNode  functionindx        ctrl.displayedForms.spliceforms[indx], 1           ctrl.isCollapsed  false   ] codepre  pFactoryp  precodeangular.modulemyApp   .factoryMainFactory, function      return []    codepre  pAppp  precodeangular.modulemyApp, [ui.bootstrap, ngRoute] codepre  pThank you for any help andor suggestions.p

Negative 12 pWindows 8.1Server 2012RC2 just introduced new APIs for virtual memory management codeOfferVirtualMemorycode, codeReclaimVirtualMemorycode, codeDiscardVirtualMemorycode, which their usage is pretty straightforward, just by looking at their names.p  pThe thing I cant get is how these APIs work against codeVirtualAlloccode plus the flags codeMEMRESETcode and codeMEMRESETUNDOcode, and what are the subtle differences.p  pFor the codeOfferVirtualMemorycode, MSDN says that is very similar to codeVirtualAlloccodecodeMEMRESETcode, except that it removes pages from the working set, and restrict further accesses to the pages.p  pSo, basically it restricts accesses to the pages, and if I want to access those pages again I must call codeReclaimVirtualMemorycode, and thats fine, but shouldnt codeMEMRESETcode also removes pages from the working set Shouldnt codeMEMRESET act as the POSIXcodeMADVDONTNEEDcodeflag ofcodemadvise2 which basically removes pages from the process pages tables, and if I access those pages again in the future, the access will generate a softfault, and those pages will be reallocated again, initialized to zero. If this is true, of course pages are removed from the working set of the process, because they basically get deallocated, even if the process keeps the virtual addresses allocated, and see them committed.p  pNow, lets see codeDiscardVirtualMemorycode here MSDN says nothing about codeMEMRESETcode flag, but if I read the description of this API, it seems emreallyem the same thing as codeVirtualAlloccodecodeMEMRESETcode.p  pSo, does anyone know if there are some differences between those APIs, and what are the proper use cases of those subtle differences IF they introduced a comopletely new API like codeDiscardVirtualMemorycode, there should be some difference with the old method.p  pIf I want to port an application from POSIX which uses codemadvise2code with codeMADVDONTNEEDcode and codeMADVWILLNEEDcode, what is the best way to mimic this POSIX behavior Until now, I used codeVirtualAlloccodecodeMEMRESETcode for codeMADVDONTNEEDcode and codeVirtualAlloccodecodeMEMRESETUNDOcode for codeMADVWILLNEEDcode. Is that ok, or I can do better with those new APIsp
Negative 12 pI am working on developing a WordPress theme, and I am planning to develop it with bootstrap. For this theme, there will be the option of having a three column left sidebar, content, right sidebar layout, or even just a left sidebar then content would work for this question. Anyway, I am blind, so am acutely aware of how annoying it would be to have to move through a sidebar on the left of the content with lots of widgets, just to get to the content itself, when a sighted user can just look down on the content. So my question How can you make the screen reader maybe the dom see the left sidebar as coming after the content, yet still have it be directly to the left of the content with bootstrap I thought of a possible way, namely making two blank divs in columns 1 and 3 with the content between them, then going to a new row and doing columns 1 and 3 with a blank div between them, but this just seems really hackish. Any thoughts Thanks, Michael.p

But when I try to install it on my phone it says Parse error there has been a problem for analysing the packet. So I though it use my fault modifying something wrong in the application so I tried to decompile the apk and then recompile it without touching anything in the apk folder. What I can see is that the original apk size is 5.78MB and the recompiled one is 5.77MB and I didnt touch anything literally and when I try to install it, the phone gives me back the same error Parse error there has been a problem for analysing the packet.p  pSo I cant figure out what the problem is.

Negative 12 pIm currently using codengmodeloptions updateOn default blur, debounce  default 500, blur 0  code in order to try to avoid showing errors to my users while theyre in the middle of filling out an input. However, I find it jarring that this also makes the errors, once theyve appeared, stay longer even if the error has already been corrected.p  pI was wondering if there was some nonhacky way of dynamically changing the ngModelOptions based on the ngModels validity, so that if the models valid it will only validate changes on blur, while if its invalid it will validate immediately. The end result of this would be that errors disappear as fast as possible, while they dont appear again until absolutely necessary.p

jquery and javascriptstrong.p  pIts a clicker game, but its a little complex with a lot of information. brI want the game to autosave all progress to local storage, and also want an option where you can click a button and wipe your saved progress and start over if you wish. I eventually intend to also implement the ability to reset all your values but start over with bonuses, like heavenly chips in the cookie clicker game.p  pIve been through tons of tutorials and messed around with my strongJS and HTMLstrong a bunch but it wont work and I dont really understand what Im doing. Theres over 5k lines of code so Im hoping I wont have to post it here.p  pThe other answers to this question on here didnt seem to be specific to my situation because they didnt really help. Assistance would be much appreciated p  pThank you cp  pEdit I have included relevant parts of the code, though trimmed down quite a bit. I didnt add the css or jquery because the website said it was too much. I dont think you can run it in this form, but hopefully thisll help.p
