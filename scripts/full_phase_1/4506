The reason is rather that I dont want any hickups in the render loop to swallow user input or otherwise make the simulation less responsive.p  pThe update loop will likely run at a lower but hopefully fixed frame rate. p  pIs this a good practice in JavaScript, or are there any obvious pitfalls My hope is that the codeupdatecode loop will receive priority, but my understanding of the event loop might be a bit simplistic.

Does anyone have a good suggestion for how I can make the lawnmower turn 90 degrees to the right and keep goingp  pThis is my codep  precodevar canvas, ctx, lawnMower, angle         function borderstop, right, bottom, left              this.top  top             this.right  right             this.bottom  bottom             this.left  left                  function directionsxAxel, yAxel, turning              this.x  xAxel             this.y  yAxel             this.angleturning                  function mowerxAxel, yAxel, width, height, direction, sides              this.width  width             this.height  height             var radius  this.height  2             this.direction  direction             this.sides  sides             this.x  xAxel             this.y  yAxel             this.create  function                    var pathnew Path2D                 path.moveTothis.x,this.y                 var x2  this.x width  radius                 path.lineTox2,this.y                 path.arcx2, this.y  radius, radius,  Math.PI  1.5,  Math.PI  0.5                 path.lineTothis.x, this.y  2 radius                 path.closePath                 ctx.fillStyle  c0c0c0                 ctx.fillpath                 ctx.lineWidth  1                 ctx.strokeStyle black                 ctx.strokepath                          this.move  functioncut                  var directionX  this.direction.x  cut                 var directionY  this.direction.y  cut                  if directionX gt 0 ampamp this.x  this.width  directionX gt this.sides.right                      direction.x  0                     direction.y  1                     direction.angle90                     x  borders.right                     y  borders.top                                   else if directionY gt 0 ampamp this.y  this.height  directionY gt this.sides.bottom                     this.direction.x  1                    this.direction.y  0                     direction.angle180                     x  borders.right                     y  borders.top                                  else if directionX lt 0 ampamp this.x lt this.sides.left                     this.direction.x  0                    this.direction.y  1                     direction.angle90                                  else if directionY lt 0 ampamp this.y lt this.sides.top                     this.direction.x  1                     this.direction.y  0                     direction.angle0                                  this.x  this.direction.x  cut                 this.y  this.direction.y  cut                 this.create                               function startMoving              ctx.clearRect0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height             lawnMower.forEachfunctiontheMower                  theMower.move10                      requestAnimationFramestartMoving                  function startCutting              canvas  document.getElementByIdfieldOfGrass             ctx  canvas.getContext2d             lawnMower  []             var sides  new borders10, canvas.width  5, canvas.height  5, 10             lawnMower.pushnew mower5, 5, 80, 60, new directions1, 0, sides             startMoving              window.onload  startCutting codepre

Additionally it seems odd that it would truncate the initial string assignment before the canvas is even involved if that was true.p  pOne glorious time I got a full DataURIp  precodedataimagesvgxmlbase64,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 codepre  pSo I tested it using that DataURI explicitly, in other words no worrying about whether or not the drawing was already finished.

Positive 4506 pHow do I scale a Tkinter canvas itself. I am creating an application where it would be far more elegant  that is to say much more readable if I can plot things on a tkinter canvas in engineering units inches and simply scale the canvas to the window. The attached code is quite over simplified for what I want to to but I believe that it gets the point across. I would like to apply the scale factor once instead of each and every time I add an object to the canvas. I would like the canvas to represent 36 inches or whatever and be scaled so that 36 inches is 1800 pixels wide or whatever window width. Once established this scale factor would not change. I know that if self.canvas.coordsthing[2]canvaswidth will have to change as well.p  pI have seen this asked in different forms but I have not found an answer that does not involve scaling all the widgits on the canvas. I think it would be rather inelegant to have a global scale factor and sprinkle it everywhere that I used a canvas coordinate.p  precodeAP moving machine from Tkinter import  MagicNumber0.3125 MNMagicNumber7 PunchPositions[MN1,2],[MN2,4],[MN3,2],[MN4,4] PiercePositions[MN5,2],[MN6,4],[MN7,2],[MN8,4] class mover     def initself,root,canvas,things         self.thingsthings         self.canvascanvas         self.rootroot         self.root.after100,self.move         self.counter0     def addovalself,x,y         r0.125         self.things.appendcanvas.createovalxr,yr,xr,yr,fillgreen     def addpierceself,x,y         r0.0625         self.things.appendcanvas.createovalxr,yr,xr,yr,fillBlack      def moveself         for thing in self.things             canvas.movething,1.250         canvaswidthcanvas.winfowidth         for thing in self.things             if self.canvas.coordsthing[2]gtcanvaswidth                  self.canvas.deletething                 self.things.removething         root.after100,self.move         self.counterself.counter1         for x,y in PunchPositions             self.addovalx,y         for x,y in PiercePositions             self.addpiercex,y  root Tk canvasCanvasroot,width1800,height200 parts[]  def AddPiercex,y     radius0.125     x1xradius     x2xradius     y1yradius     y2yradius     return canvas.createovalx1,y1,x2,y2,fillBlack def AddPunchx,y     radius0.250     x1xradius     x2xradius     y1yradius     y2yradius     return canvas.createovalx1,y1,x2,y2,fillBlue  for x,y in PunchPositions     AddPunchx,y for x,y in PiercePositions     AddPiercex,y  for l in range1,12     canvas.createlinelMagicNumber4,0,lMagicNumber4,6  canvas.packfillBOTH moverroot,canvas,parts root.mainloop codepre

Positive 4506 pThis is a follow up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32900061howdoiscaletkintercanvaswindowwithoutchangingobjectsScale Tkinter window without changing objectsap  pThis is also a bit of a styleopinion question as well.p  pI would like to put objects on to a Tkinter canvas in engineering units inches. If I use canvas.scale... it will modify the objects, which is not what I wish to do. p  pIs there a way to easily clone a canvas. I would place my objects on one canvas. Then when it came time to display it. I would copy all the objects on that canvas to a second canvas. The second canvas would then get canvas.scale... applied to it. All of my work would be done on the first canvas. I do not see an easy  elegant way to copy objects from one canvas to another directly without having to determine what the object is, then create it, then set all of its parameters. Something likep  precodeWorkingCanvasCanvasroot,width36,height10 ScaledCanvasCanvasroot,width1800,height300 WorkingCanvas.createoval0,0,0.3125,0.3125  this is in inches for object in WokingCanvas.getobjects     ScaledCanvas.addobjectobject WorkingCanvas.scaleScaleX,ScaleY,0,0 codepre  pOnly ScaledCanvas would ever be displayed ScaledCanvas.pack. Working Canvas would just remain unpacked, but all of the objects would remain in engineering units.p  pStyle Question I would like to do the above because the scaling happens once in one place. Easy to maintain. I do it once and forget about it.p  pThe other approach that comes to mind to to create a sub class for all object create and manipulate functions. Each of those functions would quietly apply the scale function. This means that canvas.create would need the scaling as well as canvas.move etc. I would also have to keep track of the current scale and the new scale if the window is resized apply that ratio to current items and then begin applying the new scale to any objects that are added  moved.p  pEven as I type this I do not at all like that approach. Seems hard to maintain.p

Positive 4506 pIm working on a terrain generator, but I cant seen to figure out how to do the colors. I want to be able to generate an image that will take up my whole PlaneGeometry. My question is how can I create a single image that will cover the entire PlaneGeometry with no wrapping based off my height map I can think of one way, but Im not sure it would fully cover the PlaneGeometry and it would be very inefficient.

Positive 4506 pIm currently working on an OpenGL project in Android. Right now, Im trying to create a clip for items to be confined to when drawing, using the stencil buffer. My problem is that I would like to be able to create a clip shape, and then remove portions of that clipped shape later on much like in an Android Canvas calling clipPath with Region.Op.UNION and then another clipPath call with Region.Op.DIFFERENCEp  pBasically, my intention is to only draw to portions of the screen with a stencil buffer bit of value 1. Therefore, as I understand it, I should be able to draw to the stencil buffer with different glStencilOp functions that will allow me to draw with 1s in some areas, and then perhaps replace them later on with the default 0 in portions of those areas.p  pAs an example test, I tried to clip a doughnut on the screen, using something like thisp  precodegl20.glClearGL20.GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT  Clear stencil buffer. gl20.glEnableGL20.GLSTENCILTEST  Enable stencil test. gl20.glColorMaskfalse, false, false, false  Disable color drawing. gl20.glStencilMask0xFF  Set 0xFF as stencil mask.   Have stencil test always fail, replace drawn stencil bits with 1. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLNEVER, 1, 0xFF  gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLREPLACE, GL20.GLKEEP,GL20.GLKEEP   Draw outer circle    Now, replace drawn stencil bits with 0. gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP   Draw inner circle.    Reenable color drawing.  gl20.glColorMasktrue, true, true, true  Now, items drawn will be confined to areas with 1 stencil bit. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLEQUAL, 1, 0xFF gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP gl20.glStencilMask0x00   Draw a filled, colored rectangle to the entire screen.  codepre  pNow, as I understand it, this should result in a colored doughnut drawn to the screen However, as the code is written above, nothing is drawn to the screen.p  pHowever, if I only clip the outer circle and not try to get rid of the inner circle with the gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP call and subsequent inner circle drawing, a circle the size of the intended outer circle draws on the screen. p  pIve looked through the documentation that I could find, and everything that Ive read so far indicates that this should work. Is there something that Im missing here Any help is greatly appreciated.p  pAlso, if this helps at all I am using the ShapeRenderer from the LibGDX open source project to draw shapes. p

Negative 4506 pI think I saw once that it was possible to use the functionality of windows search features in code.  That it was possible to search for files using a sql query something like select filename from filestore where directory  csomedir and extention in .doc,.txt,.me and datemodified  20090101 000000p  pAnyway, even if there isnt a way to do it with a query,  is there any functionality in the Windows API OR any simple code for doing exactly this type of thingp  pIt seems such an obvious thing for there not to be an easy way to do it.p  pI have a function that finds all files in a dir with subdirs but its basically dumb.

Negative 4506 pI certainly hope someone can help ease my frustration.  I am trying to find a good way to unit test my WCF service implementation classes but every resource that Ive found providing a solution is limited to services with only a single methodoperation.p  pIn my case, I have a service class which contains several service methodsoperations.  The purpose of the service class is to provide the interface to behavior that is implemented within the core application.  As such, each methodoperation is responsible forp  ol liaccepting a Request object from the callerli livalidating the objects propertiesli licreating an instance of the applicable Command object that carries out the operationli limapping the Request objects properties to the Command object.li liexecuting the Command objectli limapping the results to a Response objectli lireturning the Response to the callerli ol  pIn addition, the service method handles any exceptions that occur and return a WCF Fault.p  pWe are using Spring.NET for both IoC DI and AOP.  The service class is instantiated by Spring which allows us to use Springs ParameterValidation aspect to perform step 2.  By default, we use Spring for step 3 as well.p  pFor the most part, all of this is working great.  However, when it comes time to write unit tests to verify the behavior of a service method I get bogged down trying to figure out the right way to deal with the services dependencies on multiple Command objects one per method.p  pLets be clear, I dont have a problem mocking the Command objects we use Moq, btw nor do I have an issue doing black box testing.  I am trying to do white box testing on the internal logic, such as verifying that step 4 is performed correctly or if the Command object throws an exception, the service handles it correctly.  For these I am using mock instances of the Command object.p  pThe problem is finding the best practice for a scenario where the object under test has multiple dependencies  especially when I am only interested in one of them for the test I am running.p  pThe Constructor approach to DI just isnt practical as I would need to have as many arguments to the constructor as I do methods on my service and that could be quite a lot.  Setterinjection concerns me because the setters would only exist for the purpose of testing  and, again, there would be a large number of them in many cases.p  pThe service is designed to delegate step 4 to a virtual method that, by default, uses Spring to instantiate the Command object but van be overridden to return the mock using the inheritandoverride approach.  But this has proven to be unwieldy as well.p  pSo, after pouring over article after article online that demonstrate various solutions but, as I said, only ever reflect a service with one methodoperation, I am looking for some guidance for an approach that will be easy to implement, maintain and extend when dealing with realworld services that contain multiple methods and multiple dependencies.p  pKeep in mind that I cant use Spring to inject mocked Command objects because I need references to the mocks in order to set them up and verify the methods behavior. Not to mention that my tests are then dependent upon Spring working correctly, too.p

Negative 4506 pIve been working for some time on Java Bytecode, however, it had never occurred to me to ask why are some instructions typed I understand that in an ADD operation, we need to distinguish between an integer addition and a FP addition thats why we have IADD and FADD. However, why do we need to distinguish between ISTORE and FSTORE They both involve the exact same operation, which is moving 32 bits from the stack to a local variable positionp  pThe only answer I can think of is for typesafety, to prevent this ILOAD, ILOAD, FADD. However, I believe that typesafety is already enforced at the Java language level. OK, the Class file format is not directly coupled with Java, so is this a way to enforce typesafety for languages that do not support it Any thought Thank you.p  pstrongEDITstrong to follow up on Reedys answer.

Negative 4506 pIs it possible to determine whether or not a given registry key is redirectedp  pMy problem is that I want to enumerate registry keys in both the 32bit and 64bit registry views in a generic manner from a 32bit application.  I could simply open each key twice, first with KEYWOW6464KEY and then with KEYWOW6432KEY.  However, if the key is not redirected this gives you exactly the same key and you end up enumerating the exact same content twice this is what I am trying to avoid.p  pI did find some a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa384253.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa on it, but it looks like the only way is to examine the hive and do a bunch of string comparisons on the key.  Another possibility I thought of is to try to open Wow6432Node on each subkey if it exists then the key must be redirected.  I.e. if I am trying to open HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindows I would try to open the following keys HKCUWow6432Node, HKCUSoftwareWow6432Node, HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWow6432Node, and HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsWow6432Node.  Unfortunately, the documentation seems to imply that a child of a redirected key is not necessarily redirected so that route also has issues.p  pSo, what are my options herep

Ive also seen control characters referred to as carriage control on the internet.p  pTo avoid confusion, by control characters, I refer to the characters 1, a blank i.e. s, 0, and  as having an effect on the vertical spacing of output when placed in the b first b column character of a FORMAT statement. p  pAlso, see this textonly web page written entirely in fixedwidth typeface  a hrefhttpwww.ibiblio.orgpublanguagesfortranch214.htmlFortran carriagecontrola because nothing screams accuracy and antiquity better than prose in monospaced font. I found this page and others like it to be not quite clear.p  pAccording to a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0073191574Fortran 952003 for Scientists and Engineersa, failure to recall that the first column is reserved for carriage control can lead to i horrible i unintended output. Paraphrasing a hrefhttpemmaline1138.wordpress.com20080526davebarryincyberspaceDave Barrya, type the wrong character, and nuclear missiles get fired at Norway.p  pHowever, when I attempt to adhere to this stern warning, I find that gfortran has no idea what Im talking about.p  pAllow me to illustrate my point with some example code.

Negative 4506 pI use ObjectDataSource and bind IEnumerable[Person] to my DevExpress GridView p  precodeclass Person     private int Id get set    public string Name get set  codepre  pAt grid there are two columns Id,Name. I want new column Sum, which is calculated by person objectaggragate by person. At asp.net I create new column and calculate its value at RowDataBound event. At winforms I dont see this event and other appr. So what should I do in this case. Where can I handle binding moment Thanks p
Negative 4506 pI come across a very tricky problem with bit manipulation.p  pAs far as I know, the smallest variable size to hold a value is one byte of 8 bits. The bit operations available in CC apply to an entire unit of bytes. p  pImagine that I have a map to replace a binary pattern 100100 6 bits with a signal 10000 5 bits. If the 1st byte of input data from a file is 10010001 8 bits being stored in a char variable, part of it matches the 6 bit pattern and therefore be replaced by the 5 bit signal to give a result of 1000001 7 bits. p  pI can use a mask to manipulate the bits within a byte to get a result of the left most bits to 10000 5 bit but the right most 3 bits become very tricky to manipulate. I cannot shift the right most 3 bits of the original data to get the correct result 1000001 7 bit followed by 1 padding bit in that char variable that should be filled by the 1st bit of next followed byte of input.p  pI wonder if CC can actually do this sort of replacement of bit patterns of length that do not fit into a Char 1 byte variable or even Int 4 bytes. Can CC do the trick or we have to go for other assembly languages that deal with single bits manipulationsp  pI heard that Power Basic may be able to do the bitbybit manipulation better than CC. p

Negative 4506 pI cant figure out how to publish an audio stream from a client to the server using FluorineFx on the client. We want to stream recorded audio data from the client to the stream via the already established NetConnection. There is a NetStream class in FluorineFx but it has no publish method. The NetStream class in FluorineFx only has the play method. But as far as I understand this plays a stream from the server on the client.p  pIs publish not implemented in FluorineFx or do I miss somethingp

Negative 4506 pI have a realtime application which constantly updates a UI log RichTextBox control in the form of a ListView control. The control is updated with current application data received via events. My application was running very slow and i found it was due to the ListView log being updated, which blocks the UI thread. As you can imagine, the application appears highly unresponsive to the user.p  pI know its possible to launch a WPF Window on its own dedicated UI thread. I was wondering if its possible to host a WPF Control on its own UI thread so that the main UI thread updates the rest of the window without being blockedp  pIf this is not possible, please recommend alternatives to remedy this dilemma.p  pThanksp

Negative 4506 pWhat is the semantics of compare and swap in Java Namely, does the compare and swap method of an codeAtomicIntegercode just guarantee ordered access between different threads to the particular memory location of the atomic integer instance, or does it guarantee ordered access to all the locations in memory, i.e. it acts as if it were a volatile a memory fence.p  pFrom the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentatomicpackagesummary.htmldocsap  ul licodeweakCompareAndSetcode atomically reads and conditionally writes a variable but does not create any happensbefore orderings, so provides no guarantees with respect to previous or subsequent reads and writes of any variables other than the target of the codeweakCompareAndSetcode.li licodecompareAndSetcode and all other readandupdate operations such as codegetAndIncrementcode have the memory effects of both reading and writing volatile variables.li ul  pIts apparent from the API documentation that codecompareAndSetcode acts as if it were a volatile variable. However, codeweakCompareAndSetcode is supposed to just change its specific memory location.

Negative 4506 pSo my grid at this point dynamically expands to whatever height and I can scroll down to get coordinates using e.GetPositionmainGrid relative to the grid. It works fine up until when I scroll. Ill give an example.p  pI have a grid with some image in the background. The grids height at this point is 950. If I drag my selection square at the very bottom of the grid and get the position relative to it e.GetPositionmainGrid, I get 950. Great. p  pNow, when I resize past 950, to lets say 1200, I have to scroll down to see the rest of my grid. I do the same thing, draw a selection square at the bottom of my grid expecting my Ycoordinate to be 1200 but instead always get a Ycoordinate of 950. In other words, the offset of which I scrolled to is not being applied to the Ycoordinate and I am unsure of how to do indicate this. I pretty much want to say to WPF Get the position relative to the grid but make sure that you get it always from the origin at the upperleft of grid at 0,0 and not just the portion of the grid that is visible to you.p

Negative 4506 pI have being searching a lot, seen a few examples but they dont work at least for me. This is what I need in my application I need to use transparent PNG icons for the toolbars and also for draggable visual objects representations, ie, 72x72 page icon which can be dragged around and possibly over all elements in the client area. For the first I was thinking about using a button, set its BackImage to the transparent PNG and put BackColor as transparent it wont work, the button always show a solid color behind. As for the panel, the same problem I can put a transparent PNG as background image but the control never looks transparent where the PNG has transparent areas. I think the same with a picturebox and any other control allowing image backgrounds. So I guess, it is really about making a controls background transparent...Any ideasp  pI dont care if I need to create some sort of custom image button or image panel whatever to have truely PNG transparent buttons, panels, etc Also, please note, it is about PNG transparency, using the alpha channel, not transparent pixels, which at this ages, sucks IMHO for decent GUIs.p  pCheersp  plitiump
Negative 4506 pPeople have found a means by which to make a emdivem scrollable on ios devices using css transforms.  I have an issue with iframes on IOS safari, whereby if i try and use css3 transforms to scroll content in an iframe, the resulting content is clipped to what was rendered first on the screen. This works fine on android devices, and works on emDIVsem on IOS, but NOT iframes. This appears to be a bug in the safari webkit implementation. Ive tried increasing the height of the iframe to larger than the content contained within, and ensured overflow is enabled on the iframe.p  pHas anyone been able to come up with a workaround As im absolutely inneed of an iframe for remote content, my last resort would be to proxy content through a server sided page, and inject some javascript in order to perform a translate3d on the childs body tag this seems to work.p  pImages  after translate 3d notice clipping p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAesDl.png althttpimgur.comseFqv.pngp

Negative 4506 pIm coding a .NET library in C for communicating with a hrefhttpxbmc.org relnofollowXBMCa via its JSON RPC interface using HTTP. p  pI coded and released a a hrefhttpcode.google.compxbmcjson relnofollowpreliminary versiona but everything is done synchronously. I then recoded the library to be asynchronous for my own purposes as I wasam building an a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvHOKF2cRVaW8 relnofollowXBMC remote for WP7a.p  pI now want to release the new async library but want to make sure its nice and tidy before I do.p  pDue to the async nature a user initiates a request, supplies a callback method that matches my delegate and then handles the response once its been received.p  pThe problem I have is that within the library I track a RequestState object for the lifetime of the request, it contains the http requestresponse as well as the user callback etc. as member variables, this would be fine if only one type of object was coming back but depending on what the user calls they may be returned a list of songs or a list of movies etc.p  pMy implementation at the moment uses a single delegate ResponseDataRecieved which has a single parameter which is a simple Object  As this has only be used by me I know which methods return what and when I handle the response I cast said object to the type I know it really is  List, List etc. p  pA third party shouldnt have to do this though  The delegate signature should contain the correct type of object. So then I need a delegate for every type of response data that can be returned to the third party  The specific problem is, how do I handle this gracefully internally  Do I have a bunch of different RequestState objects that each have a different member variable for the different delegates That doesnt feel right. I just dont know how to do this gracefully and cleanly.p

Negative 4506 pI have started a migration of a high energy physics algorithm written in FORTRAN to an object oriented approach in C.

Negative 4506 pIm making an application in C WPF that consists of a toproot NavigationWindow with several pages that I navigate between for the purpose of the project. At this point, I want to extend the functionality of the application by adding in a second state of the program.p  pHeres how Id like this to work Essentially the program is a data collection application. At the moment it displays relevant UI information for database A and allows you to collect data for that one specifically. I want to expand the software by adding in a second set of UI elements that collect different data for database B, and I want to navigate between them using Tabs at the top so using tabcontrol and tabitems.p  pThe part that Im stuck on is the maintaining states portion For example, if Im on the tab for database A, I can go through a date selection screen and to the actual collection screen, but if I click on the tab for database B, then it will still be back at the date selection screen since I have not done anything there yet essentially like having 2 programs running at the same time, within each tab.p  pI tried seeing if I could change the root element of the software from a NavigationWindow to a Page that contains a NavigationWindow inside of tabitems since only Page implements tabcontrol, but I have not figured out how to do this if it can even be done. Is there a better way to go about doing thisp
Negative 4506 pOk, I will confess Ive not dug out reflector to look at whats going on here, but Im hoping someone can tell me.p  pHow do Microsoft make adding and fetching so fast, I can make adding fast by just sticking items in an array, and I can make fetching fast by sorting the array and using a binary search. If however, I was to do a quicksort every time an item was added to make fetching data fast, adding would slow down massively, and if I had to sort the data every time I tried to fetch something, adding items would slow massively.p  pDoes anyone know the internal workings of a dictionary It is a fair bit more memory hungry than an array, so theres clearly something other than clever algorithms going on behind the scenes.p  pIm trying to understand the magic and learn from itp

Negative 4506 pIm currenlty using SSIS for some process flow, scripting, and straight data import.  Most of the data cleaning and transformation is happening within stored procedures that Im calling from SSIS execute SQL tasks.  For most of the sprocs, if it fails for any reason, I dont really care about rolling back any transactions.  My SSIS error handling essentially wipes out any staging data and then logs the errors to a table.  A human needs to fix the underlying data issue at that pointp  pMy question revolves around begin tran, end tran.  Are there any cases where a stored proc can fail, and then not let the calling SSIS process know  Im looking for hardware failure, lock timeouts, etc.p  pId prefer to avoid using transactions as much as possible and rely on my SSIS error handling.p  pThoughtsp

Negative 4506 pI have an application which has many icons Buttons. I want to put a text below the icons just like mainscreen. My icon size is 128x128 for high resolution, so androiddrawableTop strategy doesnt work because I couldnt figure out a way of programmatically reducing the size of the drawable to 80x80dp. I would prefer not to create several little icon files.p  pAnother idea offered was to put a text view below each button. This is possible but sounds very clunky way of achieving this.p  pCould someone suggest a way of achieving a text below the icons p  pThanksp

Negative 4506 pI have VS 2010 Ultimate with ReSharper, Reflector, and SpecFlow extensions. I use SpecFlow in one of my test projects along with WebDriver for automated UI testing. I am now approaching about 400 individual test scenarios in that project.p  pWhen I open Visual Studio, everything is fine aside from some of the usual synchronizing slowness that comes with ReSharper. However as soon as I click the tab to show my builtin Test View, VS freezes up for about 60 seconds while the tests load.p  pIm concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the SpecFlow project. Is there anything I can change in my TestSettings file to make this go faster Should I try and ditch the TestSettings file altogether, or is this not even possible Or, should I switch from using MSTest with SpecFlow to something else like NUnit, to make the Test View slowness go awayp

Negative 4506 pThe application is written in Ruby on Rails but the problem I am facing is more a design matter than language related.p  pthe system provides service to a number of users to maintain a registry. So it relates persons to things. As such it has a model called Person representing owners and it has a model called User representing those who manage the registry.p  pNow a new requirement has arisen to allow People to log in and be able to change personal details which it was not required for the original design.p  pThe question is how to refactor the application to allow this new requirement inp  pOne easy solution is to create Users for each person who request login credentials and link user to person entity but that is not very DRY as some fields such as firstname, surname etc. are in both classes and in particular, that is precisely the data people will be able to change. Besides User and Person are stored in separate tables.p  pThe other possibility I was considering is to make one to extend the other but having data in separated tables it makes it a bit messy. Additionally the logical extension would be User lt Person as an user is generally a person but thinking on the implementation Person lt User is quite a lot easier.p  pOne last option could be to scrap User and move login credentials into Person leaving logon fields empty for those who wont log in and half of the fields empty for those just login in.p  pCan you think of a better solutionp

Negative 4506 pI have a binary protocol with some unknown amount of initial header data unknown length until header is fully decoded followed by a stream of data that should be written to disk for later processing.p  pI have an implementation that decodes the header and then writes the file data to disk as it comes in from one or more frames in ChannelBuffers so my handler subclasses FrameDecoder, and builds the message step by step, not waiting for one ChannelBuffer to contain the entire message, and writing the file data to disk with each frame.

In my a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlwshandlersoapSOAPHandler.html relnofollowSOAPHandlera, I have a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlwshandlersoapSOAPMessageContext.htmlgetHeaders28javax.xml.namespace.QName,20javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext,20boolean29 relnofollowSOAPMessageContexta object which has a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlwshandlersoapSOAPMessageContext.htmlgetHeaders28javax.xml.namespace.QName,20javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext,20boolean29 relnofollowgetHeadersa method.  This method takes in a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlnamespaceQName.html relnofollowQNamea and a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlbindJAXBContext.html relnofollowJAXBContexta as parameters and will automatically unmarshal any matching headers.p  pMy problem is that I am passing the appropriate headers but the unmarshalled object is returned empty ie all the fields are null.p  pI am a little stumped as I cannot control any of the unmarshalling I cannot set validators and see if there is a schema problem or anything else as everything is happening in a black box.  All I can pass is the codeJAXBContextcode to the method.p  pIs there anything I can do to figure out why the unmarshalling is failing even though there is no exception being thrownp  pThanks,p  pEricp

Negative 4506 pIm struggling for about 14 days now with a simple task In database, I have definitions for hardware categories. For example p  ol liHDD ul liInternalli liExternalli liFlashli ulli ol  pThis list is in database defined like thisp  precode    [ID  ParrentID  Name]  1  0  HDD, 2  1  Internal, 3  1  External, 4  1  Flash.         codepre  pThrough Entity Framework I get these rows into my application. From this flat data I then create structured object which is my DataModel. This model is defined as follows   p  precodepublic class Category     private int id  1    private string name      private ListltCategorygt subCategories  null  property getters and setters, constructors, and bool HasSubCategories    codepre  pNow, from these I create ViewModel called emSubCategoryViewModelem to which is binded my TreeView. So, I can view my categories in treeview and with my defined and maintained hierarchy. This works just fine. In emSubCategoryViewModelem is defined a strongCommandstrong through emAttached Behavior for MouseDoubleClickem which is also binded to TreeView. So, when user doubleclicks on Item, in emSubViewCategoryModelem defined method will execute particular code. List of  emSubCategoryViewModelem is nested in emHWDocumentViewModelem which is a main ViewModel for my window.  What I need now is obvious  When user doubleclicks on item in TreeView, I need to load items from database and show them in ListView. My opinion is, that in emHWDocumentViewModelem I need to define an collection of Items and load them accordingly to selected category in ListView. But, I dont know how to execute a method on HWDocumentViewModel from emSubCategoryViewModelem. Because  TreeView is binded to list of emSubCategoryViewModelem items, so when DoubleClick occurs, the method on emSubCategoryViewModelem is executed. Im searching for a way, how to execute a method on main ViewModel HWDocumentViewModel. p  pI tried this approach br I created a property  codepublic static SubCategoryViewModel SelectedCategorycode on  codeHWDocumentViewModelcode.

Negative 4506 pIm enhancing a Lotus Notes application database mainApp that involves file attachments stored in a different database data repository DB. The current implementation is that there is a main dataRepDB in a main server, then it has replica on many local servers. When users attached file in mainApp, it is actually attached to a document in the local dataRepDB. Then the local dataRepDB replicates to the main. The recurring problem is that documents in mainApp is not processed as long as the related dataRepDB documents are not complete. Sometimes, the replcation fails so the mainApp documents are stuck. My proposal was to use file compression to the attachments so that it can be uploaded faster to the main dataRepDB, without using any replica. Can you give me some tips on how I can do this I will be using java for the file compression the code is ready, my problem is how I will implement the process flow.p

My MWE is very simple hence, I suspect the problem lies in Texmaker or somehow in my setupp  precodedocumentclass[10pt,a4paper]article  usepackagegraphicx  begindocument  This is an example of an image within a figure not appearing where it should.  beginfigure[H] includegraphics[width3.in]notworking.eps captionThis caption should accompany an image. labelfignotworking endfigure codepre  pAnd the following is an example of the image by itself outside of a figure not showing up eitherp  precodeincludegraphics[width3.in]notworking.eps  enddocument codepre  pI looked at the resulting .ps file, and images show up correctly there. But if the problem lies somewhere in the ps2pdf stage, I have no idea how to correct it.  I would expect that a faulty ps2pdf.exe would cause more fatal problems than just images not showing up.p

Negative 4506 pThe ecommerce site Im currently working on has several officesweb sites Australia, Canada, Europe etc and were trying to rework the site to be more compliant with SEO and to up our rankings on Google.  Originally we had a Jquery dialog popup asking the user for their shipping country via a drop down and wed then determine which site the merchandise would be shipped out of and redirect them to the appropriate site folder httpwww.mydomain.comenca etc via Javascriptp  pWe were advised to change this for SEO purposes and list all the countries we ship to by having them wrapped in an href tag and to get rid of the initial dialog box.  Since the change we have had customers accidentally be on the wrong site and launch a complaint when they werent able to order what they wanted because of the differences in stock on the various sites.p  pWe are now thinking of doing a portal page thatd be a hybrid version of the above solutions.  List our office locations as an simple href and then under that have a If your country is not listed, select it from the drop down which will redirect them to the right site via javascript.p  pMy question is, will having that javascript redirect alongside the hrefs harm our SEO  Will Googles crawler look at the drop down, see a redirect and stop dead it in its tracks and refuse to crawl the rest of the sitep  pWe pretty much ship to anywhere in the world but its not blatantly obvious which office the merchandise will come out of based on the users shipping country.  For example our Canada location is the catch all.  If a person is say from New Zealand, then they should be on our Australia office, but if theyre from China, theyd go to our Canadian site.p  pAll the sites are under the same domain but under virtual folders, mydomain.comenca, mydomain.comenau and so on as well as sharing the same code.  Obviously the stock displayed will be different for each and the currency will also change accordinglyp  p[EDIT] In the top right hand corner of the page in the header, it says the shipping country, which will be the country that the user chooses, not necessarily the site that the user is on.  The purpose of this is so if the user selects China and sees the prices in Canadian dollars, they can see that they are on the correct site from the shipping country that is being display.  We kept track of their selection either by a javascript function to set cookies before redirecting, but later on we changed the code to have each country as an href with a querystring that would eventually set the shipping country cookie to track their selection.p  pOriginally the site was coded to default to Canada, and if a shipping country cookie wasnt set, we would show them a popup asking them to choose.  We were told by an outside consultant to get rid of this as Google would not be able to crawl the site, though I cant think why thatd be the case  Since getting rid of that initial popup, we have had several complaints from customer who dont realize they are on the Canadian site by default because now its not that obvious  We still have the shipping country displayed, but its not as inyourface as the original design with the initial popup.p
Negative 4506 pI dont understand the necessity for nested routes. There are many things about Rails routes that I DO understand.p  pHere is my simple setup in this Rails 3.2 applicationp  precodeCategories habtm Products codepre  pIn routes.rbp  precoderesources categories do   member do     get listproductsin     post addto     post removefrom   end end  resources products codepre  pI have basically created a page from which to add products to a category. There is a select box at the top containing the products, and at the bottom is the list. To add a product to the list, you choose one from the select box and click the Add button. addto is called via Ajax. Works great.p  pMy problem is that to make this app degrade gracefully, I want it to work without Ajax also.

I also have a DeleteAction which is activated with CTRLD command. When the person hits CTRLA, the following happensp  precodeListltComponentgt c  new ArrayListltComponentgt         c.addAllArrays.asListToolbarPool.getDefault.findToolbarAddEditDelete.getComponents if mode.equalsadd      for Component component  c          component.setEnabledfalse                  c.get13.setEnabledtrue         c.get14.setEnabledtrue  codepre  pSo basically whenever a user hits Add button on the toolbar, it disables all other buttons including delete so the users cant perform those actions while in Add mode.p  pHowever, they can still hit CTRLD to delete.

In order to preserve the info i have made a cron job that copies the content of the log into another log at an time interval a bit smaller than the nagios check interval. The thing that i dont understand is why is the log growing so much i mean the messages log which has i guess 1000 times more info is smaller. From what ive seen in the log there are a lot of special characters like codecode and i think that this is done by the way im manipulating the file from pyton but seeing that i olny have like three weeks of experience with it I cant seem to figure out the problem.p  pThe script code is the following p  precodeimport sys, os, re  validstring  OK filename  varlogsnmptrapd.log  if os.statfilename[6]  0         print validstring         sys.exit  else         f  openfilename,r         sharestring           line1  []         patte0  re.compile[09][09][09]         patte2  re.compileNG [azAZs09].         for line in f                 line1  line.split                  if re.searchpatte0,line1[0]                         sharestring  sharestring  line1[1]                            continue                 result2  re.searchpatte2,line                 if result2                         result22  result2.group                         result22  result22.replaceNG,                         sharestring  sharestring  result22            f.close         f1  openfilename,w         f1.close         print sharestring         sys.exit2 codepre  p                   p  pThe log looks likep  precode20120711 041716 Some IPvia UDP [this is an ip]port TRAP, SNMP v1, community somestring     SNMPv2SMIenterprises.OID Some info which is not necesarry     SNMPv2MIBsysDescrOID  STRING info which im matching codepre  pIm pretty sure that it has something to do with the my way of erasing the file but i cant figure it out.

Thank you.p  pAs an information about the size i have 93 linesso says Vim and the log occupies 161K and that is not ok because the lines are quite short.p  pOK it has nothing to do with the way i read and erased the file. Is something in the snmptrapd daemon that is doing this when im erasing its log file. I have modified my code and now i send SIGSTOP to snmptrapd reight before i open the file, and i make my modifications to the file and then i send SIGCONT after im done but it seem i experience the same behavior.

Negative 4506 pHi I am attempting to create a rectangular region tableView, that when it has no cells will be just a background color. Then when it has cells, the cell background can be different and separators become visible. This idea can be seen in a hrefhttpitunes.apple.comusappspendingsid473857206mt8 relnofollowhttpitunes.apple.comusappspendingsid473857206mt8a in the second screen shot. I can come close by just setting the background color of the table and the cells to different colors, but when there are no cells the table collapses. The screenshot in that link doesnt show this, but when there are no items, it is just an empty rectangle. How can one maintain the dimensions of the table, even when there are no cellsp

Negative 4506 pIm trying to fill a page with content from a database. My thinking is, to use some kind of while loop in php and go through each row in the database and use jQuerys .prepend command to add it below the other content. p  pThe problem Im seeing in this, is that every time the page is loaded it would be pretty resource intensive to have to load through every row in a table and display it.p  pI was thinking that when I display the item I should then change a value in the table that indicates that it is already displayed and therefore keep the current content. My problem with this is, how exactly would I keep this content there if its dynamically added like this p  pOr is there just a better way in general to do this p

Negative 4506 pI got .net 4.0 with Entity Framework 4.0 with Visual Studio 2012 and Windows 7, 64bit architecture, 4 cores. p  pIm performing some tests on a console application with the AdventureWorks database. The thing that is bothering me is that the first time I take some products it takes much more time than the second time, I want to know why. p  pI know that there are some tasks that Entity Framework perform during its first query, so I executed some extra query ahead. p  pFor example, my main function contains the following  p  precodeusing var context  new Context     execute context.Clients.ToList    lt this takes something like 300 ms   using var context  new Context     execute context.Products.ToList    lt this takes something like 200 ms   using var context  new Context     execute context.Products.ToList    lt this takes something like 10 ms  codepre  pSo you see that the first query with all the first time execution things is taking 300 ms. p  pThe second takes 200s, and the third one, which is the same like the second takes only 10ms. p  pSo my question is  why is my third query taking such a small amount of time  I do not use autocompile since there is no such in EF 4.0, or the CompiledQuery class. p  pAlso my first invocation to Products is not the first query on the model, so all the work for view generation should be already done. p  pBut still it takes so much time the first time and is so fast the second time I call Products. Does it cache something somewhere p  pAnother thing I noticed is that when I compile it for 64 bit, it takes a ridiculous amount of time, something like one second. And when I compile it for 32 bit, it takes the amount I had given. p  pCan you give me some hints here  p  pThanks p

Negative 4506 pI have an appwidgetprovider which updates my sqlite database when the icons are clicked by the user.

This has been the case from the start and when records already exist it works but when there are none it does not create any records                                      p

Negative 4506 pemstrongUPDATE 3272013emstrongp  pIt would appear that I am not leaking memory, it is just WT not keeping a persistent session every time F5 is hit, or a new user connects. Basically the old session gets deleted, and a new one is made every time F5 is hit, or a new user connects from another machine. I have read some parts of the documentation that mention making the session persistent, so when a user reloads the page, or a different user connects they all see the same content.

So, here it is I have two classes, say Base and Derived, but Derived does not add any methodattribute. Basically its just a particular case of Base when one of its attributes call it MblockSize is fixed to 1 however, none of the methods requires a particular implementation nor there is an extension of functionalities. The benefit of such Derived class is not the point of this thread. Lets assume the developers had their good reasons for this.p  pAnyway, in the piece of code Im looking something like this happensp  precodevoid fooconst Derivedamp d... [...] Base b fooDerivedamp b codepre  pSo, the developers casted the base object into a reference to a derived one. In my understanding, downcasting is done if the concrete type of the castee b is indeed Derived. Which is not the case here.p  pHowever, this is cstyle cast, so the compiler is trying a whole bunch of casts and I dont know which one it eventually works.p  pSo, questionsp  ul li1 what casting is the compiler doing Im assuming a reinterpretcast maybeli li2 would staticcastlt Derivedamp b work as wellli li3 if class Derived added some methodsattributes not used in foo, would this still workli li4 is the key point that foo does not use any functionality of Derived that is not already in Baseli ul  pI hope the question is clear.

I will have a space below it for child view controllers and their views.p  pI will show one child view controller at a time, what is a good way to do that Total amount of child view controllers is around 6, they are very different, so reusing some container view controller wont really work.p  pWhen pressing some button on these controllers I will move to next one. Should I make some property, lets say contentView that will hold a view of the controller that is currently on screen How do I handle rotation if I dont use auto layoutp  pEDIT This is more a theory question, I know of methods addChildViewController and know the way how I add views and controllers to their parents.

Negative 4506 pI have a question related to how to best compose a very large single page application using angularjs and if necessary uirouter.p  pMy scenario is this.p  ul liI have multiple components which can be say trend module, business analyzer, dash boardsworkspaces, and lots of others.li liFrom an launcher sidebar the modules can be opened one or more times in separate tabs like in an old school MDI windows application.li liSome of the modules are completely independent and some may useshare a common filtering widget which may reside somewhere one the page.li ul  pThe general idea is that each of these components could be opened multiple times in separate tabs so users can easily switch between them as part of their workflow. Another thing is that url linking should be supported for all of them. Opening the url would not involve reopening all the tabs, just the one the url links to.p  pWhen using angularjs my limited understanding so far has indicated that the best way to accomplish this would be to split my project into separate business modules as recommended for large application. Each business module containing the templates, services, directives etc that are relevant. p  pThen I could use nginclude to include the templates and then instantiate the controller for each business module. I have tested that the same controller can be instantiated multiple times and hold its own data separate. It would also be neccessary to include the required template each time the particular controller is created. This would cover the case when we want to instantiate the same module more than once in separate tabs.p  pThis does not solve the problem with url linking though it brings me to the uirouter alternative which supports multiple uiviews which may potentially solve this problem too, but I do not know enough about that yet. I suppose using uirouter one could include an url syntax that included the instance of each view but I am not sure how one would go about doing that. The idea of using multiple apps bootstrapped manually seems out of the question since this reduces the possibilities of communication between the different modules and the general opinion seems to indicate that this is a bad idea.p  pI would appreciate any feedback and constructive comments as to what would be a good approach in this situation.p
Negative 4506 pNovice python user here. There are other ways to achieve this, but I believe this is my best option. I maintain an MS Access 2007 database .accdb that is used on offline TabletPCs in the field to collect data. When arriving back at the office, the user can reconnect to the server. Im trying to utilize the pyodbc module to loop through the tables and rows and insert records from the offline field database into the server master database. The selection part of the script appears to be working to grab the records in the offline field database and put them into a dictionary for later use. Recommendations based on the original post now has the insert part looping through the dictionary and creating parameterbased sql for inserting the records. However, the code throws the following error after two records are inserted into the first table in the loop. The next sql string is for the next table  so all records are inserted into the first table correctly and the error occurs when moving to the next table. p  precodeError HY010, [HY010] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Function sequence error 0 SQLFetch codepre  pI read error information here but dont know what to make of it a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms712424vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms712424vvs.85.aspxap  precodeimport pyodbc  otherDbaseDict    connOtherDbase  pyodbc.connectDriverMicrosoft Access Driver .mdb, .accdb                                  DBQCother.accdb otherDbaseTables  connOtherDbase.cursor.tables  counter  0  for tblOther in otherDbaseTables     if tblOther.tablename.startswithtbl ignores MS sys tables         nameOther  tblOther.tablename         cursor  connOtherDbase.cursor         selectSQL  SELECT  FROM .formatnameOther generate SQL select syntax         cursor.executeselectSQL         rows  cursor.fetchall         for row in rows             counter  counter  1 counter digit used to create unique key, since table names repeat             otherDbaseDict.updatenameOtherstrcounterrow  connMainDbase  pyodbc.connectDriverMicrosoft Access Driver .mdb, .accdb                                 DBQCmain.accdb mainDbaseTables  connMainDbase.cursor.tables  beargle2 for tblMain in mainDbaseTables     if tblMain.tablename.startswithtbl         nameMain  tblMain.tablename          get all column names with list comprehension         columns  [row.columnname for row in cursor.columnstablenameMain]         for k, v in otherDbaseDict.iteritems             if nameMain in k                  build dynamic sql                 sql  INSERT into 01 values 2                  add question mark placeholders, one for each column                  value to insert                 sql  sql.formatnameMain, ,.joincolumns,                                  ,.joinlencolumns                   print sql                 cursor  connMainDbase.cursor                  execute parameterized insert                 cursor.executesql, v                 connMainDbase.commit codepre  pAny pointers on ways to reconcile the error Was just thinking, is this a cursor issue Do I need to resetrefresh or whatever it may be called after each connMainDbase.commit or before switching tables Execute dies once it finishes with the first table.

Negative 4506 pIm in the process of creating a 2d platformer using the Blender Game Engine. Im having trouble getting the camera to follow my character and keep him in the center of the screen. Initially, I tried simply parenting the camera to my character, but whenever my character turns rotates around the Zaxis 180 degrees, so does my camera, making it face the back of the level. So, I was wondering if there was a way to parent only one or two axes of an object to another, or restrain an axes from moving even if it is parented. This way I could keep the camera from rotating, but still have it follow on the Y and Z axes. One thing I looked into was using Python code. I came up with...p  precodeimport bpy char  bpy.data.objects[HitBox] obj  bpy.data.objects[Camera] obj.location.x  69.38762  this is the set distance from the character to camera obj.location.y  char.location.y obj.location.z  char.location.z bpy.data.scenes[0].update codepre  pI realize I need a loop for this after assigning the char variable, but I cant get any  Python loops working that would run through the entire game, as while loops crash the BGE. If you could help with either the parenting issue, or the Python code, Id really appreciate it.p
Negative 4506 pWell hello there. Im changing the charset of a database from codelatin1sweedishcicode to codeutf8code. Ive allways used codeutf8danishcicode because its the closest to the Norwegian character style  I think.br But what about codeutf8generalcicode and codeutf8unicodecicode  p  pSome time ago It was preferred to use codegeneralcicode for betterfaster performance, and codeunicodecicode for more accuracy because of the sorting algorithm is more complex in the latter. But since the speedperformace is no longer an issue  or not so much an issue i most cases anymore  codeunicodecicode is ok to use in most situationsp  pBut how does codeunicodecicode differ from codedanishcicodebr Is it the last three letters codecode, codecode, codecode in the nordic alphabet that is taken into account  p  pMost comparisson one vs the other I can find is only between codegeneralcicode and codeunicodecicode.p  pAnyone know of any examples for when to use codeunicodecicode or when to use codedanishcicode would be highly appreciated...p

Negative 4506 pThe scenario is as follows.  I am working at a company that started out with one iOS application.  Now, the company is interested in creating a second iOS application, that shares much of the same code base.  The original application was not written with the intention of being reusable, as it was not known at the time that a second similar application would be created.  In future, there may be even more similar applications that build on the existing code base.p  pWe are trying to determine the best option with respect to how we maintain the source code going forward.  So some of the options were contemplating include single repository with shared library, one repository for shared library and one repository that contains all of the iOS applications, one repository for shared library and one repository per iOS application, etc etc.  Theres also the question of whether to use git submodules or not if using multiple repositories etcetera.p  pCurrently, the two applications  library are all in one git repository.  One of the advantages of this is that a developer can checkout a commit of the single repository and expect the product to build, without having to worry about updating multiple repositories.  Basically, the developer doesnt have to be concerned with multiple repositories needing to move in lockstep with one another or requiring some specific combination of repositories commits for a build to work.  The developer also doesnt have to worry about cases where another developer may have remembered to commit one repository, but not the other.  p  pHere are some more things Ive consideredp  h2Submodulesh2  pIve used submodules before, but am no expert.  My understanding is that the super repository containing a submodule also stores a reference to a specific commit of the submodule.  This partly deals with ensuring that multiple repositories i.e. application  library would move in lockstep, though Im guessing there are still issues with needing to manually pull changes from the sub module.  Also, issues with a submodule commit not being available to pull if a developer happens to forget to push its changes and it is referred to by the super repository.  p  pOne nice aspect of submodules is that it creates a stronger semantic separation between the library and the applications which happen to use the library.  Whether this is useful in practice, Im not sure.p  h2Single repositoryh2  pAs previously stated, this is what were currently doing.  Two applications  shared library code all in one repository.  The greatest concern has been around the relatively nonexistent ability to isolate changes between project one and two and the library.  E.g. someone makes changes to both some library code and some application code in a single commit.  Then, another developer just wants the changes in the library code.p  pOne nice aspect of single repository is that everything moves in lockstep  nobody has to worry about keeping multiple repository versions matched.  If using XCode workspaces, refactorings are even possible across the two applications.  p  h2Branchingh2  pAnother option is to use some kind of branching model, either in a single or multiple repositories, to manage the code.  p  pUltimately, were just trying to figure out a good model going forward for managing two or more iOS applications plus shared library code.  Whether this be achieved via multiple repositories, submodules, branching models, or something else.  Any general suggestions on the pros and cons of the various optionsp

Negative 4506 pIve been switching to use ServiceStack.Logging on a small solution using Log4Net. So far it took me a couple of minutes and everything is working fine. The problem is the logs are a bit different after using servicestack... The stacktrace stacktrace parameter of log4net, also line, stacktracedetail etc... are deeper than the call in my code. Example I get stacktrace  Log4NetLogger.ErrorFormat for any stacktrace wherever it originated in my code.p  pThis makes it difficult to see what line in my code raised an exception. I could use the level parameter of stack but this doesnt feel good.p  pAny idea p

Negative 4506 pI recently purchased an SSL certificate for a domain, lets call it mydomain.com.  I have a login script which Im using to authenticate against a clients Active Directory service.  I have no real access to their server at all, although they have whitelisted my server so that I can verify whether their login credentials are correct or not.p  pLets say that the clients enter their login info on a page with URL a hrefhttpswww.mydomain.comlogin.php relnofollowhttpswww.mydomain.comlogin.phpa.  I have tested the PHP script which I have written using a test account provided by the client, and it does correctly identify whether or not the provided usernamepassword combination is correct.  However, is the login information emreallyem being encrypted as it is sent  Do I need access to a certificate on my clients AD server to make sure that the login is secure  As I understand it, since Im the one sending the information to the client, and I have an SSL certificate in place, the login information should be encrypted.  I am assuming that all that the AD server is sending to me is basically a truefalse response on whether or not the credentials are correct, which should not require encryption.p  pIs my understanding of this process correct  Id genuinely appreciate any insight you could provide.

Negative 4506 pI started the project as an MFC Application for the GUI.., and later added support for ATL.p  pI then coded a simple ATLCOM object implementing a non registered dual interface using IDispatchImpl, with the 0xfff for Major and Minor, to tell ATL to load the TLB from the EXE.p  pI skip some details, but at the end, after some debugging I found that the CComTypeInfoHolderGetTI implementation in atlcom.h was NOT trying to load the TLB from the EXE, but was searching it in the registry. Reason  a mplibid variable was NOT corresponding to the DECLARELIBID macro use in my ATLCAtlMfcModule declaration.p  pAfter some googling I found a hrefhttpcomputerprogrammingforum.com77vcatl6a0c39b3bf25ecfe.htm relnofollowBug CAtlMfcModuleInitLibId not calleda and added a call to InitLibId in my module CTOR.p  pWorks fine, now.p  pQuestion Is that a known bug with a known fix I am not confortable with my workaround of such an old bug. Is there another way of dealing with thatp  pUPDATE additional information, as an answer states there is no bug...p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary494h01te28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowIDispatchImpl Classap  pBy strongdefaultstrong, the strongIDispatchImplstrong class looks up the type information for T strongin the registrystrong. To implement an unregistered interface, you can use the IDispatchImpl class strongwithout accessing the registrystrong by using a predefined version number. If you create an IDispatchImpl object that has strong0xFFFF as the value for wMajor and 0xFFFF as the value for wMinorstrong, the IDispatchImpl class retrieves the type library strongfrom the .dll file instead of the registry.strongp  pExcerpt from codeCComTypeInfoHolderGetTIcode Implementation in codeatlcom.hcodep  precodeif InlineIsEqualGUID CAtlModulemlibid, mplibid ampamp                        mwMajor  0xFFFF ampamp                        mwMinor  0xFFFF       TCHAR szFilePath[MAXPATH]     DWORD dwFLen  GetModuleFileNameAtlBaseModule.GetModuleInstance, szFilePath, MAXPATH     [...]     hRes  LoadTypeLibpszFile, amppTypeLib  else      [...]     hRes  LoadRegTypeLibmplibid, mwMajor, mwMinor, lcid, amppTypeLib codepre  pSo, it seems clear to me that there is an emadvertised behaviorem use 0xffff for minor and major and ATL will try to load the typelib from module, not from registry, provided that your CAtlModulemlibid is up todate. How is CAtlModulemlibid expected to be be up to date By using the codeDECLARELIBIDcode macros. How does work that macro by defining a static codeInitLibIdcode function, which set up codeCAtlModulemlibidcode.p  pThe bug when your module derives from codeATLCAtlMfcModulecode, the defined InitLibId function is NOT called as ATLCAtlMfcModule is not a class templatep

Negative 4506 pSo I work on this Wordpress website with an event calendar at work. Another organization had a problem getting support from their hosting, so we migrated them to our VPS as a temporary solution. Since that has happened, theyve been submitting events to our calendar, with links going to their website. However, Wordpress upon seeing those links systematically interprets them as internal links, and looks for the document locations within our own domain name and website and obviously doesnt find them, resulting in broken links. p  pI was wondering if this issue had to do with Wordpress identifying the IP address of the other site as being local because its on the same VPS, and then interpreting local as being part of the same sitep  pIf so, how do I have to set up the hosting on the VPS to prevent that from happeningp

Negative 4506 pI have been reading through multitenancy in hibernate and couple of post from stackoverflow but it seems they are not addressing the requirement that i have, so here it is. I am working on a SAAS based application model where i have one application been served by multiple customers, and for every customer there will be a independent instance of the tenant databasepostgresSql. Apart from this i also have a master database that will be used to authenticate the user and to identify which tenant database it belongs, consider this master database will have information like the connection URL to the tenant database. p  pWhen the user logs in i will authenticate it with the master database get the tenant database information like connection URL and connect to that database and serve all the users request through that.p  pConsidering the fact that i can define multiple sessionfactories in the hibernate config file, which will make it static during application development, instead i would want to create the sessionfactories dynamically for the respective tenant database for which the user belongs by reading the information of the connection URL from the master database. p  pAlso, there also will be a scenario where in i will have to maintain the sessionfactory of the master database and the tenant database as there will be a requirement where i will have to add users to both master database and tenant database during user creation.p  pCan any one help be address this requirementp

Negative 4506 pSo for a class I am taking, we are getting practice with overloaded operators but more specifically we are designing a class for fractionsrational numbers. I am playing around with trycatch blocks and cant seem to get it to work like I want nor can I find any forums or articles on what I cant figure out. Im trying to create the rational number object in a trycatch block to make sure that the value being put into the denominator is not a 0 and if it is, I let the catch block call the deconstructor for the object. I got this bit to work just fine but it seems that there is no way for me to use the object being created within the trycatch block later on in the code even if the constructor succeeded in assigning a nonzero value to the denominator. Is there a way to declare an object within a trycatch block to verify it wont throw an exception in its creation but still have it within the scope of the rest of the code that is outside the trycatch block but still in the same function or is there no way to pull it offp

Negative 4506 pWe have a codespringbootcode project and are using codeapplication.ymlcode files. This works exactly as described in the codespringbootcode documentation. codespringbootcode automatically looks in several locations for the files, and obeys any environment overrides we use for the location of those files.p  pNow we want to also expose those codeyamlcode properties as a Map. According to the a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringbootdocscurrentSNAPSHOTreferencehtmlsinglebootfeaturesexternalconfigyaml relnofollowdocumentationa this can be done with codeYamlMapFactoryBeancode. However codeYamlMapFactoryBeancode wants me to specify which codeyamlcode files to use via the coderesourcescode property.

I was thinking of writing a MapFactoryBean that looked at the codeenvironmentcode and simply reversed the flattening performed by the codeYamlProcessorcode when creating the codepropertiescode representation of the file.p  pAny other ideasp

Negative 4506 pI have a C Windows form that has a couple of text boxes and buttons. Also it has a datagrid view that shows a sql table. I create a refresh button that allow me to refresh the table so I can see the updated items inside the table. I was wondering is there any way to refresh the table by it self. Like every 10 second.Or instead of table, perhaps the entire form loaded or refreshed by itself every 10 secondp

Negative 4506 pWe currently have a project that has had a long life in which the data tier entities were being used as the domain model entities, and that is obviously causing us some grief after years of expansion.  A small group of us have been tasked with essentially rewriting the framework of the application to which we will then transition piecebypiece.p  pOur first decision was to make sure that our domain entities were not based on the database.  Instead, we communicated with the business owners and built our objects sticking to the Ubiquitous Language principle.  The domain model code is now all done and we are fairly happy with it.p  pNow heres the crux of the problem.  We are using Microsoft Entity Framework 6 to generate our data tier using databasefirst, since we cannot start changing the database into codefirst until everything has been migrated to the new architecture, and we need the data in the database.  So what we are planning to do is mapping our Domain entities to the EF6 entities and vice versa.p  pMy first thought is to use AutoMapper to map back and forth in the repository implementations, but I feel like there is something simple I am missing, or some feature in Entity Framework 6 that Im either not using or misusing that would resolve this problem.  I feel like we cant be the only group out there suffering this kind of situation.p  pCan anyone provide us some insight on what we can do to solve this problem  As a note, we are adamant about not including context or anything datatier related in our domain model, including unit of work.  We are using Autofac as our DI container, and multiple applications use our domain model.p

Negative 4506 pIm trying to figure out if I can use OpenACC in place of normal CPU serial execution calls. Usually my programming is all about 3D programming, or uses the GPU normally in some way. I.E. Image processing, or some other type of rendering that requires the use of shaders. Im trying to figure out if this Library would benefit me or not.p  pThe reason I ask this is because if Im rendering 3D Graphics as fast as possible would it slow down that process in away Or is it able to maintain its in theory high frame rates or not.p  pIf so, whats the trade off, and how much Im not willing to loose 3D Graphics display performance to enhance operations that can be done on the CPU serially.p  pEdit This is a C context.p
Negative 4506 pi found a very strange behaviour for which i have to explanation. We have a simple table with around 450.000 entries MSSQL 2008 R2.p  pThe indexes for this table are very simplep  pIndex 1 containsp  precode[OwnerUserID] gt int, 4 byte [TargetQuestionID] gt int, 4 byte [LastChange] gt date,  8 byte codepre  pIndex 2 containsp  precode[LastChange] is a date, 8 byte [OwnerUserID] is an int, 4 byte [TargetQuestionID] is an int, 4 byte codepre  pAs you can see, the difference is only in the slightly different order of the columns in both indexes, the leafs have the same size, 16 bytes far away from what ive seen doing some DBAs on really big databasesp  pThe queries are simplep  precodeQuery 1  Asks just for the last entried element  top1  ordered by LastChange, so it takes only LastChange into account  Query 2  Asks just for the last entried element  top1  entried for a distinct OwnerUserID, so it takes OwnerUserID and LastChange into account codepre  pResults arep  pIndex 1 is super slow for query 1, albeit i thought it should be OK since the data leafs are really not big 16 bytesp  pIndex 2 is super slow for query 2 but since it takes two values into account, OwnerUserID  LastChange  8 bytes, i do not see any reason why it should be much slowerfasterp  pOur idea was to have only one index, but since the performance for each query scenario differs by 10  11 times, we ended up creating just BOTH of these indexes in parallel, where we thought we could go with one  since the index is not that bigcomplex that you would actually think this slight difference in columnorder would hurt.p  pSo, now we are wasting doubled space and since the table grows around by 10k rows per day, we will have diskspace issues somewhere in the future... p  pFirst, i thought this is because of some internal NHibernate issues, but we checked in Performance Monitor and the results are absolutely reproduceable.p  pIt seems like MSSQL performance with indexes depends highly on the usage of datetimecolumns, since this simple example shows that this could crash the whole performance p

Negative 4506 pIm using Gradle to build an EAR file.

Negative 4506 pWell, not a good title but here is the problem.p  p[Question updated]p  pI have two models, Word and Definition. When the user looks up a word the definitions are enlisted and there should be a form below the definitions so that the user can contribute by adding up another definition. So far no problem. But if the search returns no result, I will ask the user to create Word along with its first definition. p  pI do not know how to deal with the form and logic of the problem. It is more than a nested form. Because something like codeformfor [word, word.definitions.build] do formcode would not work since there is no word object to which thea new definition can be referred. p  pAddendum I seem to find a way a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19110173606431herea. It just works but not so clean to me. If you think there is a better solution please share it anyway.p

I want that if the user swipes to a delta distance from the edge left or right, it would appear an image to let the user now that, if he ends the movement, the action will take place.

Negative 4506 pSuper simple How do you declare a nonpointer object in Cp  pI triedp  precodeObject obj codepre  pBut the C compiler thinks that this is a call to the objects default constructor. Is it even possible to forward declare objects in Cp  pEDIT I dont think anyone is understanding my question. Why is it that you can declare codeint xcode and codeObject objptrcode, but not codeObject objcode I need this because a struct outside of main has to recognize the Object so it needs to be emdeclaredem outside of main, before the struct, but if the object isnt initialized inside of main then the library Im using wont function properly.p
Negative 4506 pCurrently, Is there any way to make Native 64bit DLL from node.js code on Windows82012 64bitp  pI need to develop a native 64bit DLL as a plugin for some 64bit Windows application.p  pSo far, I use C  VisualStudio.net 2012 express, with NuGetp  pUnmanaged Exports DllExport for .Net 1.2.6p  pa hrefhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesUnmanagedExports relnofollowhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesUnmanagedExportsap  pThis successfully wraps a C managed code to a nativeunmanaged DLL.p  pHowever, I wonder if its possible to use node.js instead of unmanagedC.net.p  pFor me, now, its way to easier to code in node.js instead of C, especially for websocket serverclient things.p  pHas someone done this so farp  pIf you have an idea, please let me know.

Negative 4506 pI am working on converting an infix expression to a prefix expression and have decided to use stacks to hold my expressions. I am using a linked list method for implementing the stack and am using the following data structurep  precodestruct stacknode      char charval     int intval     struct stacknode nextptr     struct stacknode prevptr  codepre  pI have then written two different codepushcode functions for codepushintcode and codepushcharcode. p  pcodepushintcode assigns a value of code0code to codecharvalcode and then the value being pushed to codeintvalcode.p  pcodepushcharcode assigns a value of code1code to codeintvalcode and then the value being pushed to codecharvalcode. p  pNote that all integer values being used are  0.p  pI have then written the rest of my functions to handle the fact that the important value in each node may be the int or the char using the negation values of 0 and 1 to identify whether the node is an int node or a char node. p  pEssentially, I am wondering if I am thinking about data structures all wrong. Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 4506 pI got this doubt because if Im not mistaken Ive read, seen, or even implemented something like that but Im not remembering, is as follows p  pHere I have an EJB project with various entities, some of them have very similar ways of saving such as the entity Contract and AuxilioFinanceiro, these two and others will implement a list of Competence and save other basic attributes . The point is that I do not have to implement multiple services and multiple DAOs with the same methods to save changing a little thing here or there that I think could have something like a generic dao or service that took the object from any entity and the entity was the responsibility of saving. p  pWe try to do with a Factory that creates the dao corresponding to the type of the object passed but I think it still is not there ... Im not sure but maybe using dependency injection would be more elegant ... Could anyone give me an idea how to solve thisp  pSorry for not so good english.p

Negative 4506 pIm looking to create a system which monitors the location of a fleet of drivers, and allows for the bidirectional communication between a driver and a dispatcher. Upstream messages from driver to dispatcher will include current location data of the driver. Downstream messages will include location data of the entire fleet so that a live map of the fleet can be maintained at the drivers end. A pubsub architecture is suited to this, with each driver a client of a server which broadcasts location data. Ive looked into a number of possibilities, including Faye and rabbitmq. Google cloud messaging CCS looks like it has some really nice features, in particular asynchronous messaging, and Im leaning towards using that. However, it is usually used for sending notifications to users to download an update. Im put off by it because it is advertised with a different purpose in mind.p  pi Can it be easily manipulated to do what I want  ii How suitable is it for what Im looking forbr iii If not are FayeRabbitMq better optionsp

Im thinking the OS is executing the .exe but running it in say Windows or System32 or something.

Negative 4506 pHey my problem is that in my AsyncTask method doInBackground I have defined a return type of codeArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgtcode and in my code I then return menuItems which is type codeArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgtcode.

Negative 4506 pUp until this point, Ive been using Spring in a development mode of sorts with hbmddl2 properties which drop all the tables and start again when I deploy the application to glassfish. It works well as a development config, since I know exactly what my database is going to contain when I run my app.p  pHowever, this isnt appropriate for an application with a rolling release cycle and Im not exactly sure how to proceed in changing it so it would be suitable in a production environment. Googling it just gives me resources on how to update Spring or Hibernate itself, but nothing on maintaining a server. Im getting the feeling Im going to have to start creating XML object property mappings for Hibernate, but I think thats a little over the top when all I want to do is update a schema with new tables and new columns with default values.p  pThanks in advance for any answers, Im completely stuck on this.p

Negative 4506 pIm having an issue that I cant seem to solve. First thing is first. Im running this on Ubuntu 14.04 with apache and php5. I am using the netbeans IDE which i originally assumed to be the issue but then i ran it directly from the web root varwwwhtml. php is working i already tested it. i can run html pages and php pages from the root. I have developed a few applications already using this computer. Some which use very advanced ajax to calls to google apis. I have no idea why all of a sudden I cant make the simplest ajax call. Anyways the problem is that when I make my ajax call to a php file nothing happens. if i inspect the page in browser, it shows that it pulled in a bunch of random iframes. I have never used an iframe before. I am really hoping that I just need a different set of eyes on this and that it isnt something else.p  pindex.htmlp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtIndex HTMLlttitlegt     ltmeta charsetUTF8gt      ltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt         document.readyfunction              .ajax                 url getHTML.php,                 data  test testing,                 type GET,                 dataType xml,                 statusCode                      0 function                           alertThank You                     ,                     200 function html                          page.appendhtml                                                                  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idpagegtThe Divltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pgetHTML.phpp  precode    ltphp        echo Hello World     gt codepre  pAfter running this in mozilla firefox, no iframes are being pulled in.

Negative 4506 pI have always been wondering how strategy games like Starcraft and Age of Empires saves a game so accurately. When you load a game, you will realize that even the projectiles from the units in the game are saved. Not only that, even the orientation of the projectile E.g. missile fired from some unit can be correctly loaded. If a unit is walking or moving, it is also accurately loaded. The developers from these strategy games are able to reconstruct the exact game state.p  pThis is what I had in mind. Each and every units in the game including the projectiles are saved as an object.p  pEach of these objects holds information such as current location on map, current orientation E.g. how many degree facing North and more.p  pAm I right on my assumption on how strategy games save a game Or are there more efficient ways to save the game state p

Negative 4506 pAnother question from a Haskell n00b. p  pIm comparing the efficiency of various methods used to solve Problem 14 on the Project Euler website.  In particular, Im hoping to better understand the factors driving the difference in evaluation time for four slightly different approaches to solving the problem.  p  pDescriptions of problem 14 and the various approaches are below.p  pFirst, a quick overview of Problem 14.  It has to do with Collatz numbers i.e., same programming exercise as my previous post which explored a different aspect of Haskell.  A Collatz number for a given integer is equal to the length of the Collatz sequence for that integer.  A Collatz sequence for an integer is calculated as follows the first number n0 in the sequence is that integer itself if n0 is even, the next number in the sequence n1 is equal to n  2 if n0 is odd, then n1 is equal to 3  n0  1. We continue recursively extending the sequence until we arrive at 1, at which point the sequence is finished. For example, the collatz sequence for 5 is 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 because 16  3  5  1, 8  16  2, 4  8  2,....p  pProblem 14 asks us to find the integer below 1,000,000 which has the largest Collatz number.  To that effect, we can consider a function collatz which, when passed an integer n as an argument, returns the integer below n with the largest Collatz number.  In other words, p 1000000 gives us the answer to Problem 14.p  pFor the purposes of this exercise i.e., understanding differences in evaluation time, we can consider Haskell versions of collatz which vary across two dimensions p  p1 Implementation Do we store the dataset of Collatz numbers which will be generated for all integers 1..n as a list or an array  I call this the implementation dimension, i.e., a functions implementation is either list or array. p  p2 Algorithm do we calculate the Collatz number for any given integer n by extending out the Collatz sequence until it is complete i.e., until we reach 1  Or do we only extend out the sequence until we reach a number k which is smaller than n at which point we can simply use the Collatz number of k, which weve already calculated  I call this the algorithm dimension, i.e., a functions algorithm is either complete calculation of Collatz number for each integer or partial.  The latter obviously requires fewer operations.p  pBelow are the four possible versions of the collatz function array  partial, list  partial, array  complete and list  complete p  precodeimport Data.Array   , listArray , assocs  import Data.Ord  comparing  import Data.List  maximumBy   array implementation partial algorithm FEWEST OPERATIONS collatzAP x  maximumBy comparing snd  assocs a where     a  listArray 0,x 01[c n n  n lt [2..x]]     c n i  let z  if even i then div i 2 else 3i1       in if i lt n then a  i else 1  c n z  list implementation partial algorithm collatzLP x  maximum a where        a  zip 01[c n n  n lt [2..x]] [0..x]     c n i  let z  if even i then div i 2 else 3i1       in if i lt n then fst ai else 1  c n z  array implementation, complete algorithm collatzAC x  maximumBy comparing snd  assocs a where     a  listArray 0,x 01[c n n  n lt [2..x]]     c n i  let z  if even i then div i 2 else 3i1      in if i  1 then 1 else 1  c n z       list implementation, complete algorithm MOST OPERATIONS collatzLC x  maximum a where        a  zip 01[c n n  n lt [2..x]] [0..x]     c n i  let z  if even i then div i 2 else 3i1       in if i  1 then 1 else 1  c n z codepre  pRegarding speed of evaluation I know that arrays are far faster to access than lists i.e., O1 vs. On access time for a given index n so I expected the array implementation of collatz to be faster than the list implementation, ceteris paribus.  Also, I expected the partial algorithm to be faster than the complete algorithm ceteris paribus, given it needs to perform fewer operations in order to construct the dataset of Collatz numbers. p  pTesting our four functions across inputs of varying size, we observe the following evaluation times comments belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comO7dMY.png altenter image description herep  pIts indeed the case that the arraypartial version is the fastest version of collatz by a good margin.  However, I find it a bit counterintuitive that listcomplete isnt the slowest version.  That honor goes to listpartial, which is more than 20x slower than listcomplete p  pMy question Is the difference in evaluation time between listpartial and listcomplete as compared to that between arraypartial and arraycomplete entirely due to the difference in access efficiency between lists and arrays in Haskell  Or am I not performing a controlled experiment i.e., are there other factors at playp

Negative 4506 pI am starting to work with requirejs for the first time and it occurred to me that the way I am using it might be bad for browser performance.  Here is the situationp  pThe nature of my application is such that the set of javascript modules that I need to load must be decided at runtime.  Based on user input, I have to load any subset of the ten js files 1.js...10.js.  I do this loading with requirejs.  The issue comes in when writing 1.js...10.js they all use requirejs to load React.  My understanding is that each of the React modules that is loaded will be a new object in the browsers memory.  With just a few files, it is much of a concernt.  However, I am curious about scaling this up to the case where there are 100 of these dynamically loaded javascript files, should I worry about this memory issue especially on, say, a mobile browser  This scaling up  is not necessarily something that will happen, so treat this as a thought experiment for my edification.  p  pThanksp

Negative 4506 pI am trying to create a GUI based on QTableView which has information in several rows. These rows are dragable.p  pThe challenge I am facing is I have to highlight the row which I pull for dragging, it should be highlighted all the time when I am continuing to drag, the highlight should go away when I take the dragged item out of the widget, BUT now if I bring it back in the widget it should remember which row was picked and should highlight it again. If user throws the dragged item outside the widget I have to forget about it.p  pI have reimplementedp  pdragEnterEvent This guy highlights the drag start row  i am saving this row number  only if this row does not exist  i am using boost optional for this row number p  pdropEvent this guy makes drag start row boostnone  means the variable does not have any value p  pWhen user starts dragging, takes the dragged item outside widget and then again brings it back,  that means dragstart  dragmoved  dragleave  dragstart happens , So I know which row to highlight  since I have saved this info while dragstart p  pIt works fine till this point.p  pBUT WHAT IF USER DROPS IT OUTSIDE WIDGET AND TRIES TO DRAG SOME ROW AGAIN  previous row number was still saved and now it highlights the previously dragged row. This is the bad case  p  pThe cleanest solution I could think of is to somehow detect when the item was dropped  even it was dropped outside widget , but seems like that is not possible.p  pI will appreciate if someone can read this long problem and can suggest some solution.p
Negative 4506 pI Have instance variables in my Android BroadCastReciver. The Receiver is defined through the manifest file.  p  pfor example something like thisp  precodepublic class MyPhoneStateReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver   String myStringstring one   Override public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent   myString string two codepre  pp  pand here is the manifest definitionp  precodeltreceiver androidnamemypackage.receivers.MyPhoneStateReceiver androidenabledtruegt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.NEWOUTGOINGCALL gt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.PHONESTATE gt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.provider.Telephony.SMSRECEIVED gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltreceivergt codepre  pNow lets imagine i recieve the very first intent now the myString variable will be two. But on the next event i receive will my instance variable be remembered or does it start initialized with string one.  So really what i am asking is is the broadcastReciever instantiated everytime a new event occurs or does it keep its state   Also if it can lose state what other then a reboot could make it lose state p

Negative 4506 pI am using DBSCAN to cluster some data using ScikitLearn Python 2.7p  precodefrom sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN dbscan  DBSCANrandomstate0 dbscan.fitX codepre  pHowever, I found that there was no builtin function aside from fitpredict that could assign the new data points, Y, to the clusters identified in the original data, X. The Kmeans method has a predict function but I want to be able to do the same with DBSCAN. Something like thisp  precodedbscan.predictX, Y codepre  pSo that the density can be inferred from X but the return values cluster assignmentslabels are only for Y.

Negative 4506 pI am having difficultly with my R code. I am trying to create a new dataframe, based on a dataframe I already have, where each duplicate value is individually multiplied by 1000 and added by 1 in order. For example, the values in my dataframe range from 3869014 to 4524673 and there are multiple values of each number up to 100. Ex [3869014, 3869014, 3869014, 3869014, 3869014, 3869014, 3869014, 3869014, 3869015, 3869015, 3869015, 3869015, 3869016, 3869016, 3869016, 3869016, etc...]. What I want is [3869014001, 3869014002, 3869014003, 3869014004, 3869014005, 3869014006, 3869014007, 3869014008, 3869015001, 3869015002, 3869015003, 3869015004, 3869016001, 3869016002, 3869016003, 3869016004, etc...]p  pI tried the following code, but it multiplies each number by 1000 and adds one regardless of duplicates. It also only adds one, rather than adding a count ex 1,2,3,4,etc.... So the output is [3869014001, 3869014001, 3869014001, 3869014001, etc... which is not what I want.

Negative 4506 pIm trying to make a simple JDialog, which asks the user for input in the form of 3 text fields, and it displays correctly and its PropertyListener works perfectly fine, I havent assigned a parent for the JDialog in its constructor, so Im guessing by default the parent is set to be the ancestor of all the components in my applet. However, when I change from the applet to, say a firefox window and when I click back on my applet, the JDialog has disappeared. Would I need to set a certain property to the JDialog to make sure it stays even when I switch windows. The starnge thing is that I think the dialog is still up, but invisible, because when another dialog appears after the first has disappeared, both dialog appear at oncethe first dialog reappearing.

Negative 4506 pI created a test App with brokered copmonent and it runs smooth on my machine, but when moved it to a tablet and did all the required settings regsvr32, icacls, it throws an exception. then I went and downloaded the Microsoft Northwind sample and it act the same. works fine on my machine but not on the other tablet. Am I missing any thing here here is the exception, its casting exception and Access denied exception  Unable to cast COM object of type NorthwindRT.DAL.FileWatcher to interface type NorthwindRT.DAL.IFileWatcherClass.

Negative 4506 pI have an program that needs to run queries on a number of very large Oracle tables the largest with tens of millions of rows. The output of these queries is fed into another process which as a side effect can record the progress of the query i.e., the last row fetched.p  pIt would be nice if, in the event that the task stopped half way through for some reason, it could be restarted. For this to happen, the query has to return rows in a consistent order, so it has to be sorted. The obvious thing to do is to sort on the primary key however, there is probably going to be a penalty for this in terms of performance an index access versus a nonsorted solution. Given that a restart may never happen this is not desirable.p  pIs there some trick to ensure consistent ordering in another way Any other suggestions for maintaining performance in this casep  pEDIT I have been looking around and seen order by rowid mentioned. Is this useful or even possiblep  pEDIT2 I am adding some benchmarksp  ul liWith no order by 17 seconds. li liWith order by PK 46 seconds. li liWith order by rowid 43 seconds.li ul  pSo any order by has a savage effect on performance, and using rowid makes little difference.

Negative 4506 pfree jqgrid uses remote json data. Its height is not specified, so height is determined from data so that all rows are visible.p  precode.extendtrue, .jgrid.defaults,      mtype POST,     toppager true,     viewrecords false,     rowList [10,20, 40, 100, 500],     rowNum 20,     url GridGetData      codepre  pThis setting returns 20 rows by default so that all rows are visible in bigger resolution and scrollbar does not appear on screen. If screen height is 768 pixels, 10 rows should be better. IF 20 is used, for bigger screen height there are lot of empty space in end of screen.p  ptop of browser window contains bootstrap menu and panel. After that starting from offsetTop jqgrid starts filling all space. How to force GetData to return number of rows depending on available height initially   Later if user select other number of rows per page, it should return user specified number of rows.p  pNumber of rows returned is appropiate, some empty space may remain or some rows can be out of screen.

Bootstrap has different classes for different resolutions, maybe those can used or custom media queries.p
Negative 4506 pstrongUpdatestrong Ive been fiddling around with a solution and Im not quite sure if we can even do it this way. I will update the question as soon as I have a better understanding of what I want p  hr  pOur current project uses WPF along with the MVVM approach. Our application will have several editors, each with its own model. p  pThe view will look like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqBcpu.png altOverviewp  pEach editor has its own modelviewmodelmodel. The parent views which holds all sub editors model contains the data from which all sub editors can be feeded.p  pSince the user should be able to save its current state at any time, we need to be able to validate the existing data as well because the user might have entered invalid data. So we need the validation in two placesp  ul liwhen the user enters datali liwhen the data is loaded again after starting the applicationli ul  pSince we do not want to convert the data into each sub editor model just to get the validation result, the parent model should be able to be validated as well.p  pThe only way I found to achieve this, is to introduce interfaces which basically describes the structure of the data within the class which is to be validated. It might look like thisp  precodeinterface IValidateModel    string foo   class Editor1Model  IValidateModel    string foo   int someOtherProperty   class Editor2Model IValidateModel    string foo   byte fooBar         class ParentModel    Sub subProp    some other parent model properties  codepre  pOnce disadvantage is that now the way the data is structured is defined by the interface.p  pDoes anyone have some experience with that problem or does even have a better solution for thisp

Negative 4506 pI am currently testing the integration of swagger in my webframework. For better understanding i will first describe the architecture a little bitbr We have a basic webapi as a maven project which provides basic webservices based on GenericTypes. Then i have an API maven project where an abstract websevice class extends the webservice described above and provides the generic types timeseries in my case and adds a few additional webservices. And third i have my example implementation where a webservice class with a Path Annotation on class level extends the abstract class from the API and hence gets the Paths from the superclasses create, get and other standard operations from the first framework and context relevant operations from the second API.br For documentation of this API i want to use swagger. I added the needed dependencies for swaggerjaxrs and swaggerannotations both in version 1.5.3M1 and put the BeanConfig in my Application. I also get the generated API if, and only if, i annotate my implementating classes method with Path  Annotations. The problem with this is that i can not access my API because Wildfly cant resolve the method to use because i declared the Path at two different levels i guess.br So my question is is such a setup possible with swagger or do i have to have PathAnnotations at the level of the ApiXAnnotations of swaggerbr SideNote The setup is wanted to have an API that has the given paths as a MUST so you can change the implementations but dont have to change the clients e.g. for different databases or business modelsbr Thanks for any answers br EDIT ok so i found my initial error if i specify the path at the method in the subclass i need to specify all other jaxrs annotations as well. But my question stays the same can i get swagger to use the jaxrs annotations of the superclasses in any wayp

Negative 4506 pThere is something I cant seem to understand about the definition of bubbling.p  pI know that event bubbling means event propagation from inner element to outer element. I also know that you can choose you way of propagation with the last optional parameter of addEventListener. p  pThe thing I do not understand is this one p  precodeltbodygt     ltdiv id  divigt         ltp id  paragtParagraphltpgt     ltdivgt      ltscriptgt         var elementd  document.getElementByIddivi          elementd.addEventListenerclick, MessageD          function MessageD             alertA message              ltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre  pHere I attach a click event to my div element. By default, the click event is bubbling, which means he is going up through the DOM. But when I click on my paragraph, the click event is executed.p  pTo my understanding, that means that the click event propagates to the p child element first, or DOWN the DOM. Can someone explain to me why and what happens Thanksp  p EDIT AFTER SOME ANSWERS p  pMaybe what troubles me is better explained through this example p  precodeltbodygt     ltstylegt         myDiv, results              margin 50px                   myDiv              padding 10px             width 200px             textalign center             backgroundcolor 000                   myDiv div              margin 10px             backgroundcolor 555              ltstylegt      ltdiv idmyDivgt         ltdivgtText 1ltdivgt         ltdivgtText 2ltdivgt         ltdivgtText 3ltdivgt         ltdivgtText 4ltdivgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv idresultsgtltdivgt      ltscriptgt         var myDiv  document.getElementByIdmyDiv,         results  document.getElementByIdresults          myDiv.addEventListenermouseover, function              results.innerHTML  Im in.ltbr gt         , false          myDiv.addEventListenermouseout, function              results.innerHTML  Im out.ltbr gt         , false     ltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre  pIf you try running this code, youll be out and in any time you enter and exit a child div... meaning youll be in in child divs.p  pDoesnt that means that the events propagate from the parent to the child, or down wayp  p FINAL EDIT  I finally understood I made a confusion between an event and an event handler. p  pAn event is just a click, so anything in a page can receive it. Once you have clicked, this click event is going to go to the top of the DOM, and when it encounters click event handler, the function associated to the event handler will be executed. p  pThanks everyonep

Negative 4506 pI have a particular requirement where I need to dedupe a list of objects based on a combination of equality criteria.p  pe.g. Two codeStudentcode objects are equal ifbr 1. firstName and id are same OR 2. lastName, class, and emailId are samep  pI was planning to use a codeSetcode to remove duplicates. However, theres a problem br I can override the codeequalscode method but the codehashCodecode method may not return same hash code for two equal objects.p  precodeOverride public boolean equalsObject obj      if this  obj         return true     if obj  null         return false     if getClass  obj.getClass         return false      Student other  Student obj     if firstName.equalsother.firstName ampamp idother.id              lastName.equalsother.lastName ampamp classother.class ampamp emailId.equalsother.emailId          return true             return false  codepre  pNow I cannot override codehashCodecode method in a way that it returns same hash codes for two objects that are equal according to this codeequalscode method.p  pIs there a way to dedupe based on multiple equality criteria I considered using a codeListcode and then using the codecontainscode method to check if the element is already there, but this increases the complexity as contains runs in On time. I dont want to return the exact same hash codes for all the objects as thats just increases the time and beats the purpose of using hash codes. Ive also considered sorting items using a custom comparator, but that again takes at least On log n, plus one more walk through to remove the duplicates.p  pAs of now, the best solution I have is to maintain two different sets, one for each condition and use that to build a codeListcode, but that takes almost three times the memory. Im looking for a faster and memory efficient way as Ill be dealing with a large number of records.p

First, I obtained five tab delimited files which are require to linux andor windows pipeline 13 obtained with APT affymetrix software. p  p1  The Axiom codecalls.txtcode or genotype filep  precode   calls lt probesetid    sample1    sample2    sample3     AX100010998    2   2   2     AX100010999    1   0   1     AX100011005    0   1   2     AX100011007    2   2   1     AX100011008    1   1   2     AX100011010    2   2   2     AX100011011    0   1   0     AX100011012    0   1   0     AX100011016    0   0   1     AX100011017    0   0   2 calls lt read.tabletextcalls, headerT codepre  p2  The codeconfidences.txtcode filep  precodeconflt probesetid sample1    sample2    sample3 AX100010998    0.00001 0.0002  0.00006 AX100010999    0.00001 0.00001 0.00001 AX100011005    0.00007 0.00017 0.00052 AX100011007    0.00001 0.00001 0.00001 AX100011008    0.001   0.00152 0.00001 AX100011010    0.00001 0.00001 0.00002 AX100011011    0.00004 0.00307 0.00002 AX100011012    0.00001 0.00001 0.00001 AX100011016    0.00003 0.00001 0.00001 AX100011017    0.00003 0.01938 0.00032  conf lt read.tabletextconf, headerT codepre  p3  The codesummary.txtcode filep  precodesumm lt probesetid    sample1    sample2    sample3 AX100010998A  740.33229   655.41465   811.98053 AX100010998B  1139.25679  1659.55079  917.7128 AX100010999A  1285.67306  1739.03296  1083.48455 AX100010999B  1403.51265  341.85893   1237.48577 AX100011005A  1650.03408  1274.57594  485.5324 AX100011005B  430.3122    2674.70182  4070.90727 AX100011007A  411.28952   449.76345   2060.7136 AX100011007B  4506.77692  4107.12982  2065.58516 AX100011008A  427.78263   439.63541   333.86312 AX100011008B  1033.41335  1075.31617  1623.69271 AX100011010A  390.12996   350.54456   356.63156 AX100011010B  1183.29912  1256.01391  1650.82396 AX100011011A  3593.93578  2902.34079  2776.2503 AX100011011B  867.33447   2252.54552  961.31596 AX100011012A  2250.44699  1192.46116  1927.70581 AX100011012B  740.31957   1721.70283  662.1414 AX100011016A  1287.9221   1367.95468  1037.98191 AX100011016B  554.8795    666.93132   1487.2143 AX100011017A  2002.40468  1787.42982  490.28802 AX100011017B  849.92775   1025.44417  1429.96567 summ lt read.tabletextsumm, headerT codepre  p4  The codegender.txtcodep  precodegender lt celfiles    gender sample1    female sample2    female sample3    female gender lt read.tabletextgender, headerF codepre  pAnd finally the map file codemap.dbcode in windows non readable or codemap.txtcode in linux as followsp  precodemap lt Name    Chr Position AX100010998    Z   70667736 AX100010999    4   36427048 AX100011005    26  4016045 AX100011007    6   25439800 AX100011008    2   147800617 AX100011010    1   98919397 AX100011011    Z   66652642 AX100011012    7   28180218 AX100011016    1A  33254907 AX100011017    5   1918020 map lt read.tabletextmap, headerT codepre  pThis is my result in strongwindows based resultstrong for codesample1codep  precodeName    Chr Position    sample1.GType  sample1.Log R Ratio    sample1.B Allele Freq AX100010998    Z   70667736    BB  Infinity    0.675637419295063 AX100010999    4   36427048    AB  0.101639462657534   0.531373516807123 AX100011005    26  4016045 AA  0.111910305454305  0 AX100011007    6   25439800    BB  0.148781943283483   1 AX100011008    2   147800617   AB  0.293273363654622  0.609503132331127 AX100011010    1   98919397    BB  0.283993308525307  0.960031843823016 AX100011011    Z   66652642    AA  Infinity    0.00579049667757003 AX100011012    7   28180218    AA  0.0245684274744242  0.032174599843476 AX100011016    1A  33254907    AA  0.265925457515035  0 AX100011017    5   1918020 AA  0.0091211520536838 0 codepre  pThe values from the windows based tool seems to be correct, but in linux output thats is not the case.
