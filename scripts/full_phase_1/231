Negative 231 pHow credible are the benchmarks carried out emwithinem a virtual machine, as opposed to real hardwarep  pLets dissect a specific situation. Assume we want to benchmark the performance impact of a recent code change. Assume for simplicity that the workload is fully CPU bound though IO bound and mixed workloads are also of interest. Assume that the machine is running under VirtualBox because its the best one p  pAssume that we measured the original code and the new code, and the new code was 5 faster when benchmarked in virtual machine. Can we safely claim that it will be at least 5 faster on real hardware toop  pAnd even more important part, assume that the new code is 3 slower. Can we be completely sure that on real hardware it will be 3 or emlessem slower, but definitely not emworseem than 3p  pUPDATE what Im most interested in is your battlefield results. Ie. can you witness a case when code that was 10 slower in VM performed 5 faster on real iron, or vice versa Or was it always consistent ie. if its fasterslower in VM, its always proportionally fasterslower on real machine Mine are more or less consistent so far at the very least, always going in the same direction.p

Negative 231 pI have an application that needs to work with a vendorsupplied API to do Screen Pops when a call is routed to the users extension.  Another developer worked on getting the API to work and delivered a prototype wrapper class that isnt quite right, and Im trying to get it right.p  pBecause this API can block for several minutes before returning, the developer started the API interface code in a separate thread, like thisp  precode constructor public ScreenPop ...params...     ... t  new Thread StartInBackground  t.Start   private void StartInBackground    listener  new ScreenPopTelephoneListener   bAllocated  true   listener.Initialize address    bInitialized  true   listener.StartListening extension    bListening  true  codepre  pThe call to Initialize is the one that could hang, if the phone server was unresponsive.p  pI dont think it was intentional on the part of the developer who did this, but when the API is initialized this way, the thread keeps running, so that now I have to stop the thread before I can clean up when I want to.  I also have to use Invoke to get events from the thread, as others so kindly pointed out in my previous question, but that is working now.p  pAnyway, here is the logic used to shut everything down and clean upp  precodepublic void ShutdownFunc    try        if  bListening             listener.StopListening       bListening  false          if  bInitialized             listener.Shutdown       bInitialized  false          if  bAllocated             listener  null       bAllocated  false          codepre  pOf course, there is a trycatch around the whole mess to prevent unhandled exceptions.p  pMy biggest problem is, how do I call the shutdown code when the API interface code is running in a separate thread  I need to clean up in case the user logs off and then logs back on again, as the API gets confused if I dont.  Thread.Abort wont work, as its not in a place to catch the exception, and the volatile bool method wont work either, for obvious reasons most of the time, the API thread is not active.p  pSo there seems to be no way to call the shutdown logic if the API interface code is running on a separate thread.  Thread.Abort bypasses all the logic and kills the thread without cleaning up.  Calling the shutdown logic from the GUI thread hangs when it calls the Shutdown method.  So, what can I dop  pThe IDispose interface just adds another layer of abstraction in the GUI thread, and does nothing to solve the problem here.p  pFor now, to get the rest of the code developed, I am eliminating threads completely.  But, before I release the app, I need to figure this out.p  pAnybodyp  pThanks,br  Davep

This is a proprietary system and we cant access the internals of it. Looking further on QNX might be advantageous to us since 6.4 has a free academic licensing option, comes with Python 2.5, and a recent GCC version. I have never tested a RTLinux system, dont know how comparable it to QNX in terms of stability and efficiency, but I know that all the members of Python habitat and nonPython tools like Google Earth that the new system could be developed on works most of the time outofthebox.p

Negative 231 pIm in the midst of preparing some SCM guidelines for our Subversion users and came across a point of contention with the team. Is there ever a valid use case for someone to make consecutive commits with identical messagesp  pIf you take the approach that a commit message should describe the what and why of code changes its difficult to see a valid case for this. Looking at our history, the instances where this has happened appear to be more out of convenience than anything else and really dont tell the story of what the code is doing.p  pDoes anyone have any views on the legitimacy of this Would guidelines or even precommit hooks be overzealous or is it a reasonable expectationp  pstrongEditstrong lets work with the assumption that people are already leaving good commit messages. IMHO, a single word like updated or typo does not constitute a satisfactory commit message. I would expect to see something more like Updated colour of submit button to green or Fixed typo in instructional copy. Its very difficult just to browse a repository log and understand whats going on in a project without drilling into individual commits if the message is a word or two.p

Negative 231 pI have created an emacs23 custom theme using customizecreatetheme. It works fine under X Linux gnome desktop. However, when running under a tty within gnometerminal some of the colors are wrong.p  pIt is not the accuracy of the colors which are a problem although it would be nice to match them under both situations but the fact that some are so off as to be unworkable. For example, function names which appear green under X are invisible under the tty, although keywords which appear gold under X also appear gold or at least some kind of yellow under the tty.p  pPerhaps under the tty colors cant be matched exactly and so something similar is being substituted If so, this doesnt seem to work all the time.p  pHow can I fix this Is it possible to specify, either in the customize GUI or in the .emacs.dmytheme.el file, that certain faces only apply to frames displayed on X and others are only for the tty, or something similarp  pIm interested in getting this, the builtin emacs theming system working rather than using some external color theme system.p

Itll be great if you can also estimate entry threshold i.e. how difficult to start using the technology for example, I spent about 1 month before I understood well at least basic principles of jsf.p  pIm most interested in SpringWicket, Grails, maybe GWT2, stripes. Im also curious about advantages of SpringSpring WebFlowJSF over simple SpringJSF.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 231 pIm working on a content dripper custom plugin in WordPress that my client asked me to build. He says he wants it to catch a page view event, and if its the right time of day 24 hours since last post, to pull from a resource file and output another post. He needed it to also raise a flag and prevent other sessions from firing that same snippet of code. So, raise some kind of flag saying, Im posting that post, go away other process, and then it makes that post and releases the flag again.p  pHowever, the strangest thing is occurring when placed under load with multiple sessions hitting the site with page views. Its firing instead of one post  its randomly doing like 1, 2, or 3 extra posts, with each one thinking that it was the right time to post because it was 24 hours past the time of the last post. Because its somewhat random, Im guessing that the problem is some kind of write caching where the other sessions dont see the raised flag just yet until a couple microseconds pass.p  pThe plugin was raising the flag by simply writing to the wpoptions table with the updateoption API in WordPress. The other user sessions were supposed to read that value with getoption and see the flag, and then not run that piece of code that creates the post because a given session was already doing it. Then, when done, I lower the flag and the other sessions continue as normal.p  pBut what its doing is letting those other sessions in.p  pTo make this work, I was using addactionloopstart,checkToAddContent. The odd thing about that function though is that its called more than once on a page, and in fact some plugins may call it. I dont know if theres a better event to hook. Even still, even if I find an event to hook that only runs once on a page view, I still have multiple sessions to contend with different users who may view the page at the same time and I want only one given session to trigger the content post when the post is due on the schedule.p  pIm wondering if there are any WordPress plugin devs out there who could suggest another event hook to latch on to, and to figure out another way to raise a flag that all sessions would see. I mean, I could use the shared memory API in PHP, but many hosting plans have that disabled. Cant use a cookie or session var because thats only one single session. About the only thing that might work across hosting plans would be to drop a file as a flag, instead. If the file is present, then one session has the flag. If the file is not present, then other sessions can attempt to get the flag. Sure, I could use the file route, but its kind of immature in my opinion and I was wondering if theres something in WordPress I could do.p

Negative 231 pI ask this because im using Partial classing to extend my db model, and in doing so some snags ive run into using inheritance and also snags ive run into declaring my db model in another class as a property and just using it like that ie codePublic Property DBModelClass as DBModelClassTypecode   however, doign direct partial classing has worked out the best, with no snags... except for an issue i seem to be running into now.p  pthat is, i create new properties with halfpage code in the Get part of the property decleration, these are like virtualnew properties that the db or db model isnt supposed to know anything about, the sort of stuff you generateuse but without saving it in your db, as im sure all of you have these. every time i submit my DBModel through an action, somehow, one of these properties Get section is running being called even though ivenever asked for it to. of course, because it aint ready to run it shouldnt errors like null errors get returned however, they wouldnt error if it were to run only when i asked for it to.p  pedit so this second part of my question, are all properties in a model generated from a db linq to sql emranem or called by the model state automatically without being asked to do sop  peman asideem i do do a modelstate.isvalid  however, this running occurs before isvalid is called as it errors out before i even see validation information. that being, is the auto calling of all properties on a db model object even when not used normal i tried using bindfalse and scaffold off on the problemed properties.p  pand the first part of my question, just as a reminder, is if i should or should not be using partial classing as a substitute to inheritance when extending db models thanks.p

Negative 231 pI am now looking for an elegant algorithm to recursively find neighbors of neighbors with the geohashing algorithm httpwww.geohash.org.br Basically take a central geohash, and then get the first ring of samesize hashes around it 8 elements, then, in the next step, get the next ring around the first etc. etc. Have you heard of an elegant way to do sop  pBrute force could be to take each neighbor and get their neighbors simply ignoring the massive overlap.  Neighbors around one central geohash has been solved many times here e.g. in Ruby a hrefhttpgithub.commasuidriveprgeohashblobmasterlibprgeohash.rbhttpgithub.commasuidriveprgeohashblobmasterlibprgeohash.rbap  pstrongEdit for clarificationstrong Current solution, with passing in a center key and a direction, like this with corresponding lookuptablesp  precode  def adjacentgeohash, dir     base, lastChr  geohash[0..2], geohash[1,1]     type  geohash.length  21  odd  even     if BORDERS[dir][type].includelastChr       base  adjacentbase, dir     end     base  BASE32[NEIGHBORS[dir][type].indexlastChr,1]   end codepre  pextract from Yuichiro MASUIs libp  pI say this approach will get ugly soon, because directions gets ugly once we are in ring two or three. The algorithm would ideally simply take two parameters, the center area and the distance from 0 being the center geohash only code[u0m]code and 1 being the first ring made of 8 geohashes of the same size around it codegt [[u0t, u0w], [u0q, u0n], [u0j, u0h], [u0k, u0s]]code. two being the second ring with 16 areas around the first ring etc.p  pDo you see any way to deduce the rings from the bits in an elegant wayp
Negative 231 pIm having problems trying to connect my website to Facebook.

My website runs in the CodeIgniter framework.p  pWhat I will do is remove everything that Ive tried and walk you through my steps up until it stops working.p  pstrongStep 1 Set up the JavaScript SDK and XFBMLstrongp  pFirst I add a reference to the FBML spec to my codelthtmlgtcode tagp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmlnsfbhttpwww.facebook.com2008fbml xmllangen langengt codepre  pThen, after my codeltbodygtcode tag, I addp  precodeltscript srchttpstatic.new.facebook.comjsapilibv0.4FeatureLoader.js.php typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt codepre  pNow here comes the first problem I had a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3104455whyismyfacebookconnectbuttontakingmetothewrongurlbut have now solveda. The problem was that the docs for the JavaScript SDK say that the codeFB.initcode method a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencejavascriptFB.initrequires the appIda as a parameter, but this turned out to be incorrect. I needed to pass my apiKey instead. So this is the code that I ended up with, that goes before my codeltbodygtcode tagp  precodeltdiv idfbrootgtltdivgt ltscript srchttpconnect.facebook.netenUSall.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt     FB.init         apiKey   ltphp echo thisgtconfiggtitemfacebookapikey gt,         status  true,         cookie  true,         xfbml   true       ltscriptgt codepre  pNow I can add XFBML entities to my pages, such as codeltfbloginbuttongtltfbloginbuttongtcode which works just as expected.

I dont get any errors though.p  pAs far as Im aware, the values are supposed to be set so that I know whether the person browsing my site is logged into their facebook account. If they are, I can see if theyve allowed my application. If theyve allowed it, I can let them disconnect from my site, if not, I can let them connect. But I cant do anything if these variables arent populated.p  pIve tried poking around inside the source of the library, but I really cant get my head around it. And Im hoping that the actual solution for this wont involve hacking the library apart. Id expect a CodeIgniter specific library to work.p  pAny ideasp  pThanks a lot. p

The upload itself seems to happen when I read the responsep  precodeDataInputStream inStream  new DataInputStreamconn.getInputStream codepre  pThis takes several seconds or minutes, depending on how large the file is and how fast the internet connection. My questions now are 1 Why doesnt the uplaod happen when I write the bytes to dos 2 How can I grab a progress in order to show a progress dialog during the upload when it all happens at oncep  pEDIT 1 I set the ContentLength in the header which changes the problem a bit, but does not in any  way solve it Now the whole content is uploaded after the last byte is written into the stream. So, this doesnt change the situation that you cant grab the progress, because again, the data is written at once. 2 I tried MultipartEntity in Apache HttpClient v4. There you dont have an OutputStream at all, because all the data is written when you perform the request. So again, there is no way to grab a progress.p  pIs there anyone out there who has any other idea how to grab a process in a multipartform uploadp

It indeed changed the name of the package to mypackage as seen in the tree navigator, but strongthe package name inside the file remained as myPackagestrong. The program executed fine inside the IDE and no errors were reported although all the classes were declaring as belonging to mybPbackage and in the tree they were under mybpbackage, but when I tried to run the jar inside the dist directory I got a class not found exception. Today I noticed that the class was reported as mybPbackagemodel instead of mybpbackagemodel. I looked into the classes and the refactoring completely meshed up everything. I mannually changed the package name from inside my classes from myPackage to mypackage, and corrected all the imports which were importing myPackage. Is this a known issue of NetBeans p  pThanksp

Negative 231 pI have a Java app that had been written originally to run on a HTC P6500 Windows Mobile device using a JVM from Esmertec or whatever the company is now called.  For whatever reason, before I ever joined the company, the app was written using absolute positioning and the main AWT Frame of the app is set to 240x295 in size.  For a long time that has been fine because our app has only ever run on one type of device.  We are now being asked to port our app to the HTC HD2 device which has a screen resolution of 480x800.  A while back one of our customers gave us a device and we ran the app on it and as you would expect it didnt take up the full screen and just looked really small.  So we came up with an estimate of how long it would take to refactor the app to work on any size screen.p  pNow, I am supposed to start working on it, and again we have been given a loan of another device for testing.  I have just installed the app on the device again and everything looks fine.  The app takes up the entire screen space and all the text and buttons etc. seem to be stretched to compensate for the higher resolution.  On the one hand this is great because I dont really need to change anything, but on the other hand I am worried by the fact that it appears to differ between the two devices I have had.p  pDoes anyone know of any reason why this difference might have occurred  Is there something in the device or Windows Mobile software that forces an app to stretch to full screen and thus scale up all components within the app i.e. text labels, buttons, text fields etc..p

I dont care which subset is selected, but I want one that fulfills all the requirements.p  pNot every set of data will have a subset that fulfills all the requirements, but I want to get as close as possible.p  pIm trying to do this with a SQL query.  I had a query that seemed to accomplish this for one set of data, but then I had to rewrite it for a slightly different set where Col2 is actually a pair of columns and could not reproduce my earlier success.  My first solution used Min and Group By and a couple Joins on aggregated results to mark duplicates for elimination in a loop until there was nothing left to safely eliminate. My more recent solution replaces the Group By queries with ROWNUMBER expressions that use PARTITIONBY.  But I cant figure out how to handle the cases where there are multiple valid result sets from multiplycrosslinked pairs like B and C in the above example.  My earlier query might have handled it, but I cant quite comprehend what I did must have had a good day when I wrote that one. Perhaps I need to do a JOIN on the ROWNUMBER expressions in my subqueries  My brain gave out for today.  I hope someone can help me find an ingeniously simple solution.p

Negative 231 pIm trying to set up JSR303 validation of forms using Spring MVC.  I had everything configured correctly or at least I think I do, and validations are working mostly correctly.  However, if I have a command object that contains a Collection of objects that I want validated, and I annotate that Collection with Valid, the Hibernate JSR303 provider is not providing the correct propertyPath.  The propertyPath inside the ContraintViolation object should be populated like codelist[0].barcode and codelist[1].barcode, but the Hibernate validator is simply providing codelist[].barcode and codelist[].barcode.  This causes a NumberFormatException when Springs SpringValidatorAdaptor.validate method tries to add field level errors since it internally expects a number to exist within those brackets.p  pUsing springcontext3.0.5 and hibernatevalidator4.1.0.Final I also tried 4.0.2.GA and 4.2.0.Beta2 and got the same results, I wrote a small unit test to illustrate the issuep  precodepackage com.foo  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Collection import java.util.Set  import javax.validation.ConstraintViolation import javax.validation.Valid import javax.validation.Validation import javax.validation.Validator  import org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotEmpty import org.junit.Test import org.springframework.util.AutoPopulatingList  public class ValidatorTest       class Person          NotEmpty         private String name          NotEmpty         Valid         private CollectionltFoogt list  new AutoPopulatingListltFoogtFoo.class          public void setNameString name              this.name  name                   public String getName              return name                   public CollectionltFoogt getList              return list                   public void setListCollectionltFoogt foos              this.list  foos                    class Foo          NotEmpty         private String bar          public void setBarString bar              this.bar  bar                   public String getBar              return bar                    Test     public void testValidator throws Exception          Foo foo0  new Foo         foo0.setBar          Foo foo1  new Foo         foo1.setBar          CollectionltFoogt list  new ArrayListltValidatorTest.Foogt         list.addfoo0         list.addfoo1          Person person  new Person         person.setNameTest Person         person.setListlist          Validator validator  Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory.getValidator         SetltConstraintViolationltPersongtgt violations  validator.validateperson          for ConstraintViolationltPersongt constraintViolation  violations              System.out.printlnconstraintViolation                codepre  pThe above test produces the following outputp  precodeConstraintViolationImplinterpolatedMessagemay not be empty, propertyPathlist[].bar, rootBeanClassclass com.foo.ValidatorTestPerson, messageTemplateorg.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotEmpty.message ConstraintViolationImplinterpolatedMessagemay not be empty, propertyPathlist[].bar, rootBeanClassclass com.foo.ValidatorTestPerson, messageTemplateorg.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotEmpty.message codepre  pThe errors that it produces are correct however, the propertyPath isnt at least from what I understand.p  pNow, if I replace Hibernates JSR303 implementation with Apaches org.apache.bval.bundle0.2incubatingusing the dependencies noted a hrefhttpincubator.apache.orgbvalcwikidownloads.html relnofollowherea, I get output that I expect.

Negative 231 pI started to ask this question already but I think I may need to reword it.  I have an asp.net web application I built in VS2010 that is published to our Sharepoint site.

Negative 231 pIm following a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com3664opengles20foriphonetutorial relnofollowa tutorial on OpenGL ES 2.0a and combining it with a tutorial on a hrefhttpwww.lighthouse3d.comtutorialsglsltutorialtoonshaderversionii relnofollowGLSL lightinga that I found, using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeMusicCubeListingsClassesteapoth.html relnofollowa handy Utah teapota from developer.apple.com.p  pAfter a lot of fiddling and experimentation I have the teapot drawn moderately correctly on the screen, spinning around all three axes with the toon shading from the lighting tutorial working. Theres a few glitches in the geometry due to me simply drawing the whole vertex list as triangle strips if you look in the teapot.h file there are 1 embedded where Im supposed to start new triangle strips, but this is only test data and not relevant to my problem.p  pThe bit I am really confused about is how to position a light in the scene. In my ObjectiveC code I have a floata hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeMusicCubeListingsClassesteapoth.html relnofollow3a vector that contains 0,1,0 and pass that into the shader to then calculate the intensity of the light.p  pWhy does the light appear to move in the scene too What I mean is the light acts as though its attached to the teapot by an invisible stick, always pointing at the same side of it no matter what direction the teapot is facing.p  pThis is the vertex shaderp  precodeattribute vec4 Position attribute vec4 SourceColor attribute vec3 Normal  uniform mat4 Projection uniform mat4 Modelview  varying vec3 normal  void mainvoid      normal  Normal     glPosition  Projection  Modelview  Position  codepre  pPosition is set by the ObjC code and is the vertices for the object, Normal is the list of normals both from a vertex array VBO, Projection and Modelview are calculated like thisp  pA CC3GLMatrix is from the Cocos3D library, mentioned in the GLES tutorial linked abovep  precodeCC3GLMatrix projection  [CC3GLMatrix matrix] float h  4.0f  self.frame.size.height  self.frame.size.width [projection populateFromFrustumLeft2 andRight2 andBottomh2 andToph2 andNear1 andFar100] glUniformMatrix4fvprojectionUniform, 1, 0, projection.glMatrix  CC3GLMatrix modelView  [CC3GLMatrix matrix] [modelView populateFromTranslationCC3VectorMake0, 0, 7] [modelView scaleByCC3VectorMake30, 30, 30]  currentRotation  displayLink.duration  90 [modelView rotateByCC3VectorMakecurrentRotation, currentRotation, currentRotation]  glUniformMatrix4fvmodelViewUniform, 1, 0, modelView.glMatrix codepre  pAnd I set the light in the scene by doingp  precodefloat lightDir[]  1,0,1 glUniform3fvlightDirUniform, 1, lightDir codepre  pThe fragment shader looks like thisp  precodevarying lowp vec4 DestinationColor  1 varying highp vec3 normal uniform highp vec3 LightDir   void mainvoid      highp float intensity     highp vec4 color     intensity  dotLightDir,normal     if intensity gt 0.95         color  vec41.0,0.5,0.5,1.0     else if intensity gt 0.5         color  vec40.6,0.3,0.3,1.0     else if intensity gt 0.25         color  vec40.4,0.2,0.2,1.0     else         color  vec40.2,0.1,0.1,1.0      glFragColor  color  codepre  pWhile trying to work this out I come across code that references the nonexistant in GLES glLightSource and glNormalMatrix but dont know what to put into equivalents I have to pass into the shaders from my code. The references to eye space camera space world space and so on are confusing, I know I should probably be converting things between them but dont understand why or how and where  in code, or in the shaderp  pEvery frame do I need to modify the light source The code I have for setting it looks too simplistic. Im not really moving the teapot around, am I, instead Im moving the entire scene  light and all aroundp

Negative 231 pThis one is a bit weird, but I will start at the beginningp  pAs far as I gathered, there are 3 ways to open up an OpenGL window in Haskell GLUT, GLFW and SDL. I dont want to use GLUT at all, because it forces you to use codeIORefcodes and basically work in the codeIOcode monad only. So I tried GLFW and made a little thingie on my laptop, which uses Xubuntu with the XFCE desktop system.p  pNow I was happy and copied it to my desktop, a fairly fresh installed standard Ubuntu with Unity, and was amazed to see nothing. The very same GLFW code that worked fine on the laptop was caught in an endless loop before it opened the window.p  pRight then I ported it all to SDL. Same code, same window, and SDL crashes with p  precodeMain.hs user error SDLSetVideoMode SDL message Couldnt find matching GLX visual codepre  pI have checked back with a hrefhttpwww.libsdl.orgopenglindex.php relnofollowSDLgearsa, using the same method to open a window, and it works fine. Same with some other 3D application, and OpenGL is enabled fine.p  pWhat baffles me is that it works under a XUbuntu but not on an Ubuntu.

Negative 231 pI know you can do thisp  precodeif DEBUG     [RequireHttps] apply to this action only endif codepre  pWhat if you are using Web Farm Framework where the Controller server receives an outside SSL 443 request, decrypts it, then forwards it to the Primary  Secondary servers using http 80 without sslp  pIn this environment, I tried the [RequireHttps] attribute but it responded with The page isnt redirecting properly in Firefox.  Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.  Its recognizing its not SSL, but because it strips off SSL, MVC wont ever see SSL attributes.p  pHow would you rewrite certain action methods to use https in MVC 3 in a web farm  How can you do this with code[RequireHttps]code or do you have to cherry pick every URL in your website that requires ssl and URL Rewrite itp  pEDITp  pI changed the controller to identify port 443 traffic and forward it to https on the web farm.  I thought I could get away with only loading the SSL certs on the controller, but they need loaded on the Primary and Secondary as well or only.p
Negative 231 pI am in the process of changing my Asp.Net MVC3 project to use Autofac for service injection into my controllers.  So far this has been pretty straightforward.

Negative 231 pI am using the technique explained here to make the popover view size refresh properly when switching between view controllers p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2752394popoverwithembeddednavigationcontrollerdoesntrespectsizeonbacknavPopover with embedded navigation controller doesn39t respect size on back navap  pIt works fine... except for this the button that I use to invoke the popover is in the right corner of the window. Like expected the popover window is shown to the left of it. p  pSo, lets assume that the button is in frame  900, 700, 40, 40 , and the first view controller is 200 x 200. p  pThe popover view is located approximately at 700, 500, 200, 200. p  pIf from that view controller I push another bigger view lets say 400x 400, the popover view resizes appropiatelly, moving more to the left.p  pHowever, when I go back to the 200x200 view controller the popover view resizes, but it stays on the left, so it is approximately located at  500, 500, 200, 200. p  pIn other words, if when navigating through the hierachy of views there is a wider view, it will expand to the left, and when going back it will shrink from the right effectively moving the content to the left.p  pNote sorry about the confusing explanation. Didnt know really well how to explain this issue. p  pBTW the exact same program works perfectly if I put the button on the left side of the view, so the popover is forced to grow to the right from the beginning  however, marketing wants the button on the right. p

Negative 231 pI have a service running that contains an SQLite DB and a Content Observer registered to the DBs URI.  The Content Observer uses an SQLiteOpenHelper to query the data from the DB.  So when new data is put into the services DB from other application via Content Provider the changed cursor will be observed and query the data to process.  The problem is if I insert data at a fast pace from other applications I end up with both the Content Observer and Content Provider opening the DB and causes an SQLite error with a database lock.p  pI am using the getReadable and getWritable methods and closing the DB and any cursors after they are used.

Negative 231 pI have two daemons, and A is speaking to B. B is listening on a port, and A opens a tcp connection to that port. A is able to open a socket to B, but when it attempts to actually write said socket, I get a SIGPIPE, so Im trying to figure out where B could be closing the open socket. p  pHowever, if I attach to both daemons in gdb, the SIGPIPE happens before any of the code for handling data is called. This kind of makes sense, because the initial write is never successful, and the listeners are triggered from receiving data. My question is  what could cause daemon B to close the socket before any data is sent The socket is closed less than a microsecond after opening it, so Im thinking it cant be a timeout or anything of the sort. I would love a laundry list of possibilities to track down, as Ive been chewing on this one for a few days and Im pretty much out of ideas.p  pAs requested, here is the code that accepts and handles communicationp  precode extern char PAddrToStringpbsnett   int i int n  timet now  fdset SelectSet  NULL int SelectSetSize  0  int MaxNumDescriptors  0  char id[]  waitrequest char tmpLine[1024]  struct timeval timeout  long OrigState  0  if SState  NULL   OrigState  SState  timeout.tvusec  0  timeout.tvsec   waittime  SelectSetSize  sizeofchar  getfdsetsize SelectSet  fdset calloc1,SelectSetSize  pthreadmutexlockglobalsockreadmutex  memcpySelectSet,GlobalSocketReadSet,SelectSetSize   selset  readset   readset is global  MaxNumDescriptors  getmaxnumdescriptors  pthreadmutexunlockglobalsockreadmutex n  selectMaxNumDescriptors, SelectSet, fdset 0, fdset 0, amptimeout  if n  1      if errno  EINTR          n  0  interrupted, cycle around         else          int i      struct stat fbuf       check all file descriptors to verify they are valid        NOTE selset may be modified by failed select       for i  0 i lt MaxNumDescriptors i              if FDISSETi, GlobalSocketReadSet  0         continue        if fstati, ampfbuf  0         continue         clean up SdList and bad sd...         pthreadmutexlockglobalsockreadmutex       FDCLRi, GlobalSocketReadSet       pthreadmutexunlockglobalsockreadmutex         END for each socket in global read set       freeSelectSet      logerrerrno, id, Unable to select sockets to read requests       return1        END else errno  EINTR         END if n  1   for i  0 i lt maxconnection ampamp n  0 i      pthreadmutexlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex    if FDISSETi, SelectSet           this socket has data      n      svrconn[i].cnlasttime  timeNULL      if svrconn[i].cnactive  Idle              void funcvoid   svrconn[i].cnfunc        netcounterincr        pthreadmutexunlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex        funcvoid ampi         NOTE  breakout if state changed probably received shutdown request         if SState  NULL ampamp           OrigState  SState         break            else               pthreadmutexlockglobalsockreadmutex       FDCLRi, GlobalSocketReadSet       pthreadmutexunlockglobalsockreadmutex        closeconni, TRUE        pthreadmutexunlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex       pthreadmutexlocknumconnectionsmutex        sprintftmpLine, closed connections to fd d  numconnectionsd select bad socket,         i,         numconnections        pthreadmutexunlocknumconnectionsmutex       logerr1, id, tmpLine               else     pthreadmutexunlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex     END for i    NOTE  break out if shutdown request received   if SState  NULL ampamp OrigState  SState   return0   have any connections timed out   now  timetimet 0  for i  0i lt maxconnectioni      struct connection cp    pthreadmutexlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex    cp  ampsvrconn[i]    if cpgtcnactive  FromClientDIS          pthreadmutexunlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex      continue         if now  cpgtcnlasttime lt PBSNETMAXCONNECTIDLE          pthreadmutexunlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex      continue         if cpgtcnauthen amp PBSNETCONNNOTIMEOUT          pthreadmutexunlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex      continue  do not timeout this connection           NOTE  add info about node associated with connection  NYI     snprintftmpLine, sizeoftmpLine, connection d to host s has timed out after d seconds  closing stale connectionn,     i,     PAddrToStringampcpgtcnaddr,     PBSNETMAXCONNECTIDLE    logerr1, waitrequest, tmpLine     locate node associated with interface, mark node as down until node responds     NYI    closeconni, TRUE    pthreadmutexunlocksvrconn[i].cnmutex      END for i   return0  codepre  pNOTE I didnt write this code.p
Negative 231 pIn connection with a migration project, migrating data from DB2 to SQL Server I have run into a problem with the way the .NET provider towards DB2 uses data cursors.p  pToday the client is executing a set of .NET batch programs against DB2 using the ADO.NET provider from Host Integration Server 2010.p  pThe programs are using a Db2Data reader to iterate over a cursor defined in a DB2 Package. In some cases the cursor is declared strongwith holdstrong, allowing the cursor to be left open after a commit have been made in the transaction scope.p  pThe ADO.NET provider codeSystem.Data.SqlClientcode for SQL Server 2008 R2 does not support this feature.p  pDoes anyone have any experience on emulating the desired behavior of the DB2 provider with regards to cursor with hold.p  pIt should be noted that a reimplementation of the Stored Procedures using TSQL cursors does not yield the desired effect, because a SQL Server ADO.NET data reader cannot interact with a TSQL cursor the same way as the DB2 Provider and DB2 does today this is at least our understanding.p

Negative 231 pIve received the goahead to start building the foundation for a new architecture for our code base at my company. The impetus for this initiative is the fact thatp  ul liOur code base is over ten years old and is finally breaking at the seams as we try to scale.li liThe top layers, if you want to call them such, are a mess of classic ASP and .NET.li liOur database is filled with a bunch of unholy stored procs which contain thousands of lines of business logic and validation.li liPrior developers created clever solutions that are nonextensible, nonreusable, and exhibit very obvious antipatterns these need to be deprecated in short order.li ul  pIve been referencing the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff650706.aspxMS Patterns and Practices Architecture Guidea quite heavily as I work toward an initial design, but I still have some lingering questions before I commit to anything. Before I get into the questions, here is what I have so far for the architecturep  pHighlevelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKWZbT.png altHighlevelp  pBusiness and Data layers in depthp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVM5M4.png altBusiness and Data layers in depthp  pThe diagrams basically show how I intend to break apart each layer into multiple assemblies. So in this candidate architecture, wed have emelevenem assemblies, not including the topmost layers.p  pHeres the breakdown, with a description of each assemblyp  ul licodeCompany.Project.Common.OperationalManagementcode  Contains components which implement exception handling policies, logging, performance counters, configuration, and tracing.li licodeCompany.Project.Common.Securitycode  Contains components which perform authentication, authorization, and validation.li licodeCompany.Project.Common.Communicationcode  Contains components which may be used to communicate with other services and applications basically a bunch of reusable WCF clients.li licodeCompany.Project.Business.Interfacescode  Contains the interfaces and abstract classes which are used to interact with the business layer from highlevel layers.li licodeCompany.Project.Business.Workflowscode  Contains components and logic related to the creation and maintenance of business workflows.li licodeCompany.Project.Business.Componentscode  Contains components which encapsulate business rules and validation.li licodeCompany.Project.Business.Entitiescode  Contains data objects that are representative of business entities at a highlevel. Some of these may be unique, some may be composites formed from more granular data entities from the data layer.li licodeCompany.Project.Data.Interfacescode  Contains the interfaces and abstract classes which are used to interact with the data access layer in a repository style.li licodeCompany.Project.Data.ServiceGatewayscode  Contains service clients and components which are used to call out to and fetch data from external systems.li licodeCompany.Project.Data.Componentscode  Contains components which are used to communicate with a database.li licodeCompany.Project.Data.Entitiescode  Contains much more granular entities which represent business data at a low level, suitable for persisting to a database or other data source in a transactional manner.li ul  pMy intent is that this should be a strictlayered design a layer may only communicate with the layer directly below it and the modular breakdown of the layers should promote high cohesion and loose coupling. But I still have some concerns. Here are my questions, which I feel are objective enough that they are suitable here on SO...p  ol liAre my naming conventions for each module and its respective assembly following standard conventions, or is there a different way I should be going about thisli liIs it beneficial to break apart the business and data layers into multiple assembliesli liIs it beneficial to have the interfaces and abstract classes for each layer in their own assembliesli listrongMOST IMPORTANTLYstrong  Is it beneficial to have an Entities assembly for both the business and data layers My concern here is that if you include the classes that will be generated by LINQ to SQL inside the data access components, then a given entity will be represented in three different places in the code base. Obviously tools like AutoMapper may be able to help, but Im still not 100. The reason that I have them broken apart like this is to A  Enforce a strictlayered architecture and B  Promote a looser coupling between layers and minimize breakage when changes to the business domain behind each entity occur. However, Id like to get some guidance from people who are much more seasoned in architecture than I am.li ol  pIf you could answer my questions or point me in the right direction Id be most grateful. Thanks.p  hr  pEDIT Wanted to include some additional details that seem to be more pertinent after reading Baboons answer. The database tables are also an unholy mess and are quasirelational, at best. However, Im not allowed to fully rearchitect the database and do a data cleanup the furthest down to the core I can go is to create new stored procs and start deprecating the old ones. Thats why Im leaning toward having entities defined explicitly in the data layerto try to use the classes generated by LINQ to SQL or any other ORM as data entities just doesnt seem feasible.p

Negative 231 pI have a sort of general question about the geocoder gem and how to design my models in rails to facilitate the useful features of the geocoder.p  pI have an Article model, and Place model. An Article will always be written about a Place, so an article will always have a placeid. The Place model contains the address of the place and and the latitude and longitude columns that geocoder requires. p  pgeocoder has a method nearbys that allows me to find places nearby a given place, for example place.nearbys would yield a collection of places nearby place. Thats great, but I want to be able to find all the articles that are written recently, and written about places nearby. p  pI can only think of two ways to do that. Either add a latitude and longitude column to my Article model, which would allow me to search articles.nearby. The problem with this solution is that it seems like it wouldnt be good model design, since a Place should be responsible for holding the latitude and longitude, not every article written about the place. p  pIf you can make some suggestions on how I could easily achieve this, that would be great, thatnksp

Negative 231 pI am trying to use Slow Cheetah to switch between a local db connection string and a SQL Azure connection string. This is in a Azure worker role that I am pushing to Azure with TeamCity. When I look through the log file the Slow Cheetah process is running correctly and is producing a transformed app.config but a future build stepthat i dont think I can control is over writing the transformed file with the original app.config.p  pHas anyone else had any success with this method or can you point me at another method to switch my connection strings. I was pointed towards just using one connection string and editing the hosts file to point at the db I wanted but that seems messy.p
Negative 231 pOn my website, I have BBCode enabled on my forum, however, some of my users have been exploiting this, and have been making the source of the image a page that gives the user Respect Points. I was wondering if there could be a way to check if the URL that is inside of the [ img ] tag is a real image, and not just a web page. I was thinking the getimagesize function could be useful here, but I cant find a proper way to check if it is a real image AND be able to parse it with regular expression afterwards. Id prefer not just checking file extensions, because some images dont have file extensions on my website. Any insight on thisp

Negative 231 pI am trying to optimize my application for for it to perform well right after it is started. At the moment, its distribution contains 304 binaries including external dependencies totaling 57 megabytes. It is a WPF application doing mostly database access, without any significant calculations.p  pI discovered that the Debug configuration offers way better 5 times gain times for most operations, as they are performed for the first time during the lifetime of the applications process. For example, opening a specific screen within the app takes 0.3 seconds for NGENed Debug, 0.5 seconds for JITted Debug, 1.5 seconds for NGENed Release and 2.5 seconds for JITted Release.p  pI understand that the gap in JIT compilation time is caused by the JIT compiler applying more aggressive optimizations for the Release binaries. From what I can tell, Debug and Release configurations differ by the codepDebugTypecode and codepOptimizecode switches passed to the C compiler, but I see the same performance gap even if I build the application with codepConfigurationRelease pDebugTypefull pOptimizefalsecode  that is, the same image debug options as in codepConfigurationDebugcode.p  pI confirm that the options were applied by looking at the codeDebuggableAttributecode applied to the resulting assembly. Observing the NGEN output, I see codeltdebuggtcode added to the names of some assemblies being compiled  how does NGEN distinguish between debug and nondebug assemblies The operation being tested uses dynamic code generation  what level of optimization is applied to dynamic codep  pNote I am using the 32bit framework due to external dependencies. Should I expect different results on x64p  pNote I also do not use conditional compilation. So the compiled source is the same for both configurations.p

Negative 231 pI have a working MySQL data warehouse that is organized as a star schema and I am using Talend Open Studio for Data Integration 5.1 to create the ETL process.  I would like this process to run once per day.  I have estimated that one of the dimension tables dimUser will have approximately 2 million records and 23 columns.p  pI created a small test ETL process in Talend that worked, but given the amount of data that may need to be updated daily, the current performance will not cut it.  It takes the ETL process four minutes to UPDATE or INSERT 1,000 records to dimUser.  If I assumed a linear relationship between the count of records and the amount of time to UPDATE or INSERT, then there is no way the ETL can finish in 34 hours my hope, let alone one day.p  pSince Im unfamiliar with Java, I wrote the ETL as a Python script and ran into the same problem.  Although, I did discover that if I did only INSERT, the process went much faster.   I am pretty sure that the bottleneck is caused by the UPDATE statements.p  pThe primary key in dimUser is an autoincrement integer. My friend suggested that I scrap this primary key and replace it with a multifield primary key in my case, 23 fields.p  pBefore I rip the test data out of my warehouse and change the schema, can anyone provide suggestions or guidelines related to p  ol lithe design of the data warehouseli lithe ETL processli lihow realistic it is to have an ETL process INSERT or UPDATE a few million records each dayli liwill my friends suggestion significantly help li ol  pIf you need any further information, just let me know and Ill post it.p  pUPDATE  additional informationp  precodemysqlgt describe dimUser Field                        Type                Null Key Default            Extra userkey                     int10 unsigned    NO   PRI NULL               autoincrement idA                         int10 unsigned    NO       NULL idB                         int10 unsigned    NO       NULL field4                      tinyint4 unsigned NO       0 field5                      varchar50         YES      NULL city                         varchar50         YES      NULL state                        varchar2          YES      NULL country                      varchar50         YES      NULL zipcode                     varchar10         NO       99999 field10                     tinyint1          NO       0 field11                     tinyint1          NO       0 field12                     tinyint1          NO       0 field13                     tinyint1          NO       1 field14                     tinyint1          NO       0 field15                     tinyint1          NO       0 field16                     tinyint1          NO       0 field17                     tinyint1          NO       1 field18                     tinyint1          NO       0 field19                     tinyint1          NO       0 field20                     tinyint1          NO       0 createdate                  datetime            NO       20120101 000000 lastupdate                  datetime            NO       20120101 000000 runid                       int10 unsigned    NO       999 codepre  pI used a surrogate key because I had read that it was good practice.  Since, from a business perspective, I want to keep aware of potential fraudulent activity say for 200 days a user is associated with state X and then the next day they are associated with state Y  they could have moved or their account could have been compromised, so that is why geographic data is kept. The field idB may have a few distinct values of idA associated with it, but I am interested in knowing distinct idA, idB tuples.  In the context of this information, my friend suggested that something like idA, idB, zipcode be the primary key.p  pFor the large majority of daily ETL processes 80, I only expect the following fields to be updated for existing records field10  field14, lastupdate, and runid this field is a foreign key to my etlLog table and is used for ETL auditing purposes.p

Negative 231 pI inherited a codebase that offers similar services over two channels p  ol liRESTHTTP  handled by annotated Spring controller li liJMS  handled by a Message Driven POJO li ol  pMessage structure on both channels is more or less similar, so there is a lot of redundantduplicate processing logic in controller and JMS listener. One way to fix that is to extract common logic into another component and inject that component into both Controller  and JMS listener. p  pLets say I dont have time to do that for now. Is there a way I could inject controller into JMS listener and call the same controller methods that are automatically invoked by Springs dispatcher servlet when a REST request arrives.

Negative 231 pIm new to web development but from what Ive learned so far, Im sure what I want to do is super easy. I just havent quite figured it out, yet. p  pI have an app that pulls external html pages. These pages all pertain to grain prices. I have about ten pages or so and currently to change the prices I open each page, find the prices and manually change them. What I want to do is just have all the pages pull their prices from the same document Im assuming this will have to be an xml or txt document so that I just have to update that one external document. p  pThe external document will be hosted on the same server as the html pages. p  pThis seems like something I should be able to do simply with javascript and Ajax and I have seen many examples using just that. The thing is that in all of the examples Ive seen, the ajax calls an entire text document instead of just one piece of it. p  pFor example, I have an html page called Northern Alberta Prices and it lists about six different grain prices. I want that page to call the external document lets call it prices.xml and get all the northern Alberta prices off of it and put them in their proper places on the html page and then I want the Central Alberta Prices page to also call prices.xml and take the relevant prices off it etc. p  pWhat would be the best way to do this p  pIm not able to use PHP on my server at the moment but any answers involving PHP would still be welcome.p  pThank you for your time. p

Negative 231 pRecently Ive come into the problem that my hard drive is getting obnoxiously full, but after going through my personal files and deletingmoving all of the oversized video files, I still have a rather small amount of ROM available.  So I put my programmer brain to work and decided that instead of meticulously going through each folder and subfolder myself and using the rightclick  Properties function of Windows to see how big a file is and whether or not its worth keeping around, I could write a simple code that would search for every file on my computer, throw it into a list by its full path name, and put its file size right next to it, then sort it from greatest to least by file size. So I hopped online, started doing the research, and thats when everything hit the fan for me.  Ive found plentiful code snippets that work for their designated task but whenever I try to utilize them myself I run into boatloads of build errors.

Ive looked up how to grab the files out of subdirectories, but trying to integrate those code snippets with this one proved more trouble than I could have imagined.  On the rare occasion that light was seen at the end of the tunnel, my program would touch a directory that was apparently protected by Administrator privileged I am the only user, and thus Administrator of my computer and tossed out errors like a chimpanzee at a zoo tosses out feces.p  pSo on the whole, what I am seeking assistance with is Program that searches every file on my computer I am assuming that starting with the C drive is where I can access everything Takes each file, its size, and the path to that file and throws it onto a listarraywhatever Sorts it by file size from greatest to least Places this list into a .txt filep  pThe last part I actually dont need help with since I am rather familiar with the Streamwriter class.  I can even muck my way through sorting by file size with a quasisimple parsing algorithm I can make on the fly if my listarrayetc of filespathssizes all conform to the same patterns and can be converted into strings.  So roughly 90.23 of my issues are simply getting all the files, getting into or ignoringandcontinuing Admin protected folders I think ignoring them would be best since I highly doubt anything in a protected folder should ever be deleted.  Ever.  Getting the paths and sizes of all of those files, and organizing them.p

Negative 231 pAt the moment I am investigating how to introduce a DVCS in particular I am looking at Hg and Git while retaining the CVS repository in parallel or even just the access mechanism via the CVS protocol. There are some developers here that are very reluctant to switch from CVS, but running them in parallel should be fine if they can be synchronized automatically or have a CVS protocol frontend.p  pThe CVS repository has been manually edited ondisk in the past, but all seems to be consistent and I can anyway try out the conversion before and we can also retain a copy of the CVS repository in the state it was when we migrated.p  pMy idea, given the Git support for it, was to run the codegitcvsserver1code frontend, but I have no experience with it, nor with the actual conversion that has to take place beforehand. Assuming this is a sane idea overall, can anyone please give pointers to articles that list experiences with this migration path. It would also be great to learn of potential caveats if you have to offer any such advice.p  pThe migration is supposed to be as seamless as possible. So staging it at night after a few rehearsals will be fine as long as the CVS frontend works seamlessly afterward.p  pThe workflow with the DVCS will ultimately be centralized again, but I want to leverage the superior merge tracking and other mechanisms that ancient CVS simply doesnt have.p

Negative 231 pWe are trying to implement table partitioning for a Data Warehouse Fact table which contains approximately 400M rows. Our ETL takes data from source system 50 days backwards new rows, modified rows, based on source system timestamp from the previous load. So in every ETL cycle there are new rows coming in, and also old rows which are updating the corresponding rows in the Fact table. The idea is to insert new rows into the Fact table and update modified rows. p  pThe partition column would be date int, YYYYMMDD and we are considering to partition by month. p  pAs far as Im concerned, table partitioning would ease our inserts via a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryms191160.aspx relnofollowfast partition switch operationsa. We could split the most recent partition to create a new free partition, load new rows into a staging table using date constraint, e.g for the most recent month and then use partition switch operation to move new rows into the partitioned Fact table. But how can we handle the modified rows which should update the corresponding rows in the Fact table Those rows can contain data from the previous months. Does partition switch help here Usually codeINSERTcode and codeUPDATEcode rows are determined by an ETL tool e.g. SSIS in our case or by codeMERGEcode statement. How partitioning works in these kind of situationsp

Negative 231 pWe are building an end to end solution that will allow our customers to access their ERP data hosted in their own servers through mobile applications. Version 1 will be an iOS app.p  pWe need to make sure the traffic between the client and the server is encrypted with SSL. The problem lies in that we want the installation of the server to be as seamless as possible, hence we dont want the customer to go through the process of buying and installing SSL Certificates. Not even mentioning having to renew that certificate every year.p  pWe were thinking of creating a self signed CA certificate and use it to create child certificates for each client to install on their servers along with the public CA certificate. We would automate the process of creating the child certificate and include it as part of the setup process. The certificate will also have a very long expiration date as to not dealing with expirations. But if we use this certificate the requests from the client wont be trusted as the CA wont be trusted.p  ol liCan the CA be added to the iOS app or deviceli liIs there a security concern with this implementationli ol

Negative 231 pI am creating an MVPlike application in GWT.p  ul liThere are multiple panels, and each one is visible at all times. li liEach panel has a Presenter, and there is a single AppController which sits above all Presenters.li liThere are some applicationlevel events which arise within one Presenter but have implications for other Presenters.li liThe suggested architecture for this seems to involve an Event Bus. However, Im not sure I see the advantage over something simpler.li liIn particular, wouldnt it be cleaner to simply allow the AppController and only the AppController to subscribe to events from any Presenter The AppController can then tell each Presenter what to do, given the event.li liThe Event Bus seems like a quasiglobal variable. But if you can accomplish the same thing with more precisely defined methods i.e. the methods which AppController calls on each Presenter isnt that preferable li ul  pTo put my concern more precisely why introduce an Event Bus at all, rather than simply letting events bubble up to the appropriate decisionmaking level To me this seems like the most straightforward extension of the MVP concept, and it doesnt require the new idea of an Event Bus. I dont understand what problem the Event Bus was introduced to solve.p

Negative 231 pThere was a book that talks about have a codePhoneNumbercode class, and then we would define an codeAddresscode class that inherits from codePhoneNumbercode, and I said at one time, that we cant do that, because an address is not a phone number, and to inherit, it must be a is a relationship.  Such as a dog is an animal, and we we can make codeDogcode inherit from codeAnimalcode.p  pBut since we have to follow a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLiskovsubstitutionprinciple relnofollowLSP  Liskov Substitution Principlea, then the is a rule actually is not the determining factor here, because a square is a rectange with width  height, but LSP says we cant define a codeSquarecode class and inherit from the codeRectanglecode class.  The simple explanation in English, I think, is the object codeaRectcode can respond to the message codesetWidthAndHeightw, hcode, but codeaSquarecode cant respond to it correctly and allow the whole program to run correctly.p  pSo surprisingly, the codeAddresscode class inheriting the codePhoneNumbercode class violates the is a relationship, but it doesnt violate LSP.  Then formally, what OOP principles does it violatep
Negative 231 pI want to achieve exactly same floatingpoint results in a gccLinux ported version of a Windows software. For that reason I want all double operations to be of 64bit precision. This can be done using for example mpc64 or msse2 or fstorefloats all with side effects. However one thing I cant fix is transcendental functions like sinasin etc. The docs say that they internally expect and use I suppose long double precision and whatever I do they produce results different from Windows counterparts.p  pHow is it possible for these function to calculate results using 64bit floating point precisionp  pUPDATE I was wrong, it is printf.17f that incorrectly rounds the correct double result, print x in gdb shows that the number itself is correct. I suppose I need a different question on this one... perhaps on how to make printf not to treat double internally as extended. Maybe using stringstream will give expected results... Yes it does.p

Negative 231 pIm using nginx for a PHP REST API that Im working on. To be fully RESTful, Im using codePUTcodecodeDELETEcode requests where appropriate. However, PHP doesnt parse the post body on codePUTcode requests  which I need for this particular scenario.p  pI had considered parsing it myself, but a Id rather let PHP do it in C as its considerably faster than any implementation I could come up with in PHP and b there are a lot of edge cases that people have already spent a lot of time working around  Id rather not duplicate those efforts.p  pOn the API side, I have already added support to read the codeXHTTPMethodOverridecode header and use that when available over the actual verb.p  pAll Im looking for now is a way, in nginx, to take a codePUTcode request, and change it to a codePOSTcode request with that header set.p  pI feel ike I have looked all over the place but cant find a solution. Anything would be helpful even if you recommend a different parsing technique so I dont have to deal with this.p
Negative 231 pI am trying to build intranet app with php and mySql on Xammp. My main goal is to manage huge file directory  subdirectories which are located on windows server. All filenames are containing greek and mix greekenglish words. It seems that no matter which filemanager I use elFinder, eXtplorer etc all have the same problem. They cant handle greek filenames. Meaning while uploading they trasliterate them with UTF8 encoding producing unreadable filenames on windows. I know that windows default encoding is iso88597. So, my question is does and mySql on Xammp can handle this task or should I move e.g. to ASP.NET.p

Negative 231 pIve a pretty basic question related to user profile storage along a session.p  pLets say that Ive an Account table that stores user profiles and that Ive linked this table to ASP.NET SimpleMembership. Once a user is logged in, controllers may need to retrieve information in or based from her Account. What Im doing right now is querying the database each time I need data, with something similar to this codedbContext.Accounts.Wherea gt a.EmailAddress  User.Identity.Name.Singlecode.p  pBut Im afraid that this may cause unnecessary load on the DB and think that a better idea perhaps its what everybody does is to store the Account object in a Session variable once a user logs in, enabling direct access without requerying the DB. Is this the usual way to do it Isnt there a risk of desync between the Session variable and the authenticationp  pThanksp
Negative 231 pMy objective is simple. I have a module called Quotes, I have managed to get Magento to create a new quote record each time a cart is created by changing the isactive column when a quote is checked out. So I have a bunch of quotes each related to a customer and i have salesorderitem rows each related to a quote.  I have a page in the backend which displays a grid of all the quotes. When a quote is clicked, the edit page has two tabs, one with a Form.php showing the details of the quote. customer name, date etc, then I have another tab which should contain a grid of all the items in that quote. It seems so simplep  precodethisgtaddTabitemssection, array   label gt MagehelperquotegtQuote Items,   title gt MagehelperquotegtQuote Items,   content gt thisgtgetLayoutgtcreateBlockquoteadminhtmlquotesedittabcartgttoHtml,  codepre  pThen in my cart block I have thisp  precodeprotected function prepareCollection      collection  MagegetModelsalesorderitemgtgetCollection     printrcollection     thisgtsetCollectioncollection      return parentprepareCollection  codepre  pIm not even interested in loading the correct collection by orderid because there is a problem ro be solved here first The codeprintrcode statement reveals the collection I specified but passing it to thissetCollectioncollection gives me No records found rendered in the grid. In typical Magento fashion there are no errors etc. I understand that the model is supposed to query the database as needed but that doesnt seem to be happening. I suppose its time to read Magecore files but you can imagine my frustration at such a simple tasking being so complicated so I would appreciate it if anyone who knows whats going on here can help me out. Thanks in advance.p

Note that task is a common one, only the selected array gets changed.p  pFor example, according to what I can currently think of, yeah switchcase, I can implement the function as below.p  precodevoid doStuffchar letter     switchletter         case a             syma[0][0]1  just for demonstration D         break         case b             symb[0][0]1  same thing, only the character a changed to b         break         ...         case z             symz[0][0]1         break         case 0             sym0[0][0]1         break         case 1             sym1[0][0]1         break         ...         ...           codepre  pBut there must be a better way. If i have 1000 such arrays, then do I have to write 1000 such cases For all the cases, content is exactly the same. Only one character of a variable name gets changed.p  pIt would be nice if theres something like string concatenation. p  precodedefine conca,b a  b codepre  pThen codeconcsym,acode will represent codesymacode. But that cant be directly applied here. Because i cant pass the exact letter to the right side argument of codeconca,bcode, only the variable which contain the desired letter can be passed. p  precodevoid doStuffchar letter     concsym,letter[0][0]1  codepre  pcodeconcsym,lettercode gives codesymlettercode. But i need to concatenate codesymcode with the content of  the character variable codelettercode.p  pFor example, if i call codedoStuffbcode them codesymbcode should be given, instead of codesymlettercode.p  pHope my requirement clear. This thing seems pretty simple but I cant think of way to get rid of this. Note that the sizes number of rowscolumns of the 2D arrays are not fixed. Otherwise i could have used a 3D array.p  pAny thought is appreciated.p

Negative 231 pI am working on a mapping application that finds the shortest route between the things a user wants. Each thing the user wants such as bread or gas has multiple possible locations. Currently, I am simply planning the route between the user and the closest instance of each item to the user, however this is not always the best route. As outlined in the diagram below, the fastest route sometimes involves visiting clusters of further away node img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFBFqT.png altenter image description here For each item, I have up to fifty possible nodes locations. How can I plan the shortest route that visits every node in any order While pointers to specific examples of how to solve this would be great, all Im really looking for is a point in the right direction to begin solving this problem.p

First module is made from XIB files which also runs independently. I have made another module using storyboard and I had to integrate these two independently running modules. The screen of my first module  which I want to connect to my storyboard is a subclass of UIViewController and I was able to do that with the help of stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16713460howtoloadastoryboardfromaxibfileHow to load a storyboard from a XIB filea by creating an object of UIStoryBoard. Now my application is able to go to the storyboard but I cant come back to my first module which is made up of XIB files.p  pPlease let me know how can I connect to the same instance of the last screen of the first module through which storyboard is called so that I can move back and forth through these views easily. Connecting to the same instance of the XIB file is important because it is a chat screen and when I come back to this screen, I would like to get back to the chat where I had left it and also when I come back to the storyboard by clicking a button on the chat screen I have a slider on the screen which should display the value which the user must have chosen when they were on this screen last time. I guess creating a new object should give me a new screen which wont work in this situation. This kind of mechanism works well within storyboard with the use of segue where we can define both source and destination view controller.p  pPlease help me achieve the same in my situation.p  pPlease also check the screen shots of the XIB file and the storyboard which I want connected.p  pThanks.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjYAGA.png altenter image description herep

Negative 231 pI have a Java SWING program with basically a single, simple window. The window contains a menu an a JPanel. Ideally, Id want to use the menu to choose an external jar file which is another SWING program and run it. The jar should then execute in the background and use the JPanel in my window instead of creating a new window on its own. Would this be possible My guess is that I should somehow expose or make available my JPanel to the external application, but I cant figure out how I could do this. Even a simple code snippet would be really appreciated. Thanks a lotp

Negative 231 pProblem I have an ejbjar1.jar which defines EJBs and Entities. The project structure is listed below. During deployment all EJBs are successfully bootstraped  started and their JNDI locations are printed in a log file. Theres a class in my WAR file which needs to access a NAMED QUERY defined on an Entity which resides inside codeejbjar1.jarcode. When this piece of code is run it throws an illegalArgumentException saying NAMED QUERY cannot be found. On a different note I also cannot get reference to SEAM components that were started when codeejbjar1.jarcode was deployed. I printed the JNDI tree from appwar.war file and it does not have any JNDI resources from codeejbjar1.jarcode.

Negative 231 pIm new to HTML5 amp CSS3 so Im working on a simple project to learn it better. I recently discovered responsive design so I am creating a page that scales to my phone. I using media queries, I created two states, one for screens 640px mobile and smaller and one for screen 641px and bigger desktop. The site works fine, showing the correct styles on my desktop when I scale the window and showing the correct style when I view it on my phone.p  pHowever, after running the site, I decided to check the resolution of my HTC One  its 1080p. My phone displays the 640px site regardless of orientation. Im wondering why this happens the phones higher resolution shouldnt trigger the mobile state, but it does. Im thinking I might be confused on how resolutions actually work. p  pSo, how do I determine the true resolution of phones and tablets so that I can create appropriately scaled sites for them p  precodeMobile media screen and maxwidth 640px      ...

Negative 231 pIm traing to host website on my win 2008 r2 server. I installed xammp. On localhost everything is working fine. But i cant acsess my site from another computer. Its always directing me to localhost S Cant figure out, what im doing wrong Sp  pApache httpd.confp  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.   NOTE Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes  instead of backslashes e.g., capache instead of capache.  If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located  will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply  an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot Cwebserverapache    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultlogs    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

User daemon Group daemon  ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin postmasterlocalhost    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName localhost80    Deny access to the entirety of your servers filesystem.

Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.

Negative 231 pSome backgroundp  pA customer has asked an Certified SQL Server Consultant for his opinion on migrating from sql server 2005 to sql server 2008.p  pOne of his most important recommendations was emnotem to use backuprestore but instead use the migration wizard to copy all the data into a new database.p  pHe said that this would ensure that the inner structure of the database would be in an SQL 2008 format, and would ultimately result in better performance.p  pThe Customer is skeptical about this because they cant find any writing, in white papers or otherwise to corroborate the consultants statement.p  pSo they posed me this question p  pGiven an SQL Database, which originally started out on SQL Server 2000, and has migrated to newer versions of SQL Server using backuprestore. and finally being on SQL Server 2005p  pWould migrating to SQL Server 2008 using the Migration Wizard, and in effect copying all the raw data into a new database, result in better performance characteristics. Then if they would be using the BackupRestore method againp

Negative 231 pIm using OpenCV and I want to store a number of images codeMatcode objects in a vector. I have declared the vector as follows to store pointers to codeMatcode objects.p  precodestdvectorltMatgt images codepre  pThe codeMatcode objects are created using the codenewcode keyword, and then added to the vector.p  precodeMat img  new Matheight, width, CV8UC3  set the values for the pixels here images.pushbackimg codepre  pHow would I go about making sure that I free the memory occupied by the codeMatcode objects to avoid memory leaksp  pWhat Im doing right now is the followingp  precodeMat im  images.atindex  process and display image here deleteim codepre  pValgrind is reporing a possible memory leak with reference to the created Mat objects. Am I missing somethingp  pstrongEditstrongp  pOk. Apparently it is better to avoid using codeMatcode pointers and dynamically allocating codeMatcode using codenewcode. I have modified my code to use codestdvectorltMatgtcode instead. However, I still see some blocks that were allocated by codeMatcode possibly lost in the Valgrind report. I also notice that memory usage steadily increases while the program is running.p  pLet me clarify what Im doing. Im creating images in a function and placing them in a buffer internally using a codestddequecode. This buffer is then accessed by another function to retrieve and image and pass it to another function which performs processing and rendering. p  precodeclass Render     public       void setImageMatamp img           thisgtimage  img               void render            process image and render here           private       Mat image  codepre  pThread that continuously fetches images from buffer and renders them.p  precodevoid processvoid opaque      ImageProcessor imgProc  ImageProcessor opaque    Mat img      while imgProcgtisRunning         get an image from the buffer       imgProcgtbuffergtgetFrontimg         set the image       imgProcgtrenderergtsetImageimg         process and render       imgProcgtrenderergtrender       codepre  pNow, everything is passed as object references i.e. codeMatampcode. I assume that after getting an image from the buffer and passing it to the rendering function, the only reference to that object will be in that function. Therefore, when I get another image, there will no longer be a reference to that object and it will be destroyed. But Valgrind gives me the followingp  precode25,952,564 bytes in 11 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 14,852 of 14,853   in ImageProcessorgenerateImage in ImageProcessor.cpp393   1 malloc in usrlibvalgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linux.so   2 cvfastMallocunsigned long in usrlocalliblibopencvcore.so.2.4.2   3 cvMatcreateint, int const, int in usrlocalliblibopencvcore.so.2.4.2   4 cvMatcreateint, int, int in usrlocalincludeopencv2coremat.hpp353   5 cvMatMatint, int, int in usrlocalincludeopencv2coremat.hpp75   ... codepre  pAnd here is codegenerateImagecodep  precodevoid generateImage     Mat imgh, w, CV8UC3      set values of pixels here    thisgtbuffergtpushBackimg  codepre

Negative 231 pWith the current version of ObjectiveC, what are the official standards and best practices for declaring ivars, using codepropertycode and codesynthesizecode There are a lot of posts and resources on the topic but most of them are fairly antiquated from a year or two ago. I recently learned to only declare ivars in a statement block in the implementation of a class so that the encapsulation principles of OOP arent broken but is declaring ivars even necessary in this day and age What would be a possible use case where doingp  precodeinterface MyClass property nonatomic NSString data end  implementation MyClass     private         NSString data  end codepre  pis necessary To further that, is it ever necessary to use codesynthesizecode My understanding is that using codepropertycode will autosynthesize both the accessor methods as well as the backing ivars. Ive done some experimentation and I noticed that when I dont declare codeNSString data, I can still accesscodedata in my class implementation. Does that mean that declaring ivars come down to a matter of style, up to the discretion of the programmer Could I condense my code and remove all ivar declarations in the statement blocks in my implementation and just use codepropertycode in my private interface If thats not the case, what are the advantages and disadvantages of explicitly declaring ivarsp  pFinally, codedynamiccode. From what I can gather, its used to say to the compiler, Hey compiler, dont autogenerate the accessor method and dont worry if you dont find an implementation for it, Ill provide one at runtime. Is that all codedynamiccode is used for or is there more to itp  pI just want to clarify all these things because it seems like theres a lot of different opinions and that theres not necessarily one right answer. Plus as ObjectiveC grows and progresses, those answers will change so itll be nice to have a concise and uptodate guide. Thanks everyone  Also if theres anything that I could word better or make clearer, let me knowp  pEDIT p  pIn summary, what Im asking is thisp  p1 Is declaring ivars with modern ObjectiveC necessary 2 Can I achieve the same effects of declaring ivars and corresponding properties by just using codepropertycode 3 What is dynamic used for 4 Can I completely forgo the use of codesynthesizecode or is there a good use case for itp  pUpvote and down vote as you see fit.p

But what on the earth could be a reason for this comparison behavior If I was implementing codeundefinedcode I would return codeundefinedcode for any comparison that has codeundefinedcode as an operand. But they choose to return codebooleancode, and then why the results are like thisp  pNow I think the best solution is just to handle any appearance of codeundefinedcode in a special way with multiple of codeifcode statements.p  precode    undefined  undefined true     undefined  undefined true      undefined  undefined false     undefined  undefined false     undefined lt undefined false     undefined gt undefined false     undefined lt undefined false     undefined gt undefined false codepre

Negative 231 pIm trying to understand how Cyclomatic Complexity works and how I can avoid the warnings.

How is that possible From a hrefhttpphpmd.orgrulesindex.html relnofollowthe documentationa, I would count this as a 1. The only possibility is that PHPMD is descending down into the various method calls.p  pBut if thats so, then I have no way to fix this method. Generally I would reduce the complexity of a method by extracting out smaller helper methods. This method got refactored into those various update methods already, to eliminate a bunch of conditional updating that happens. The original method had a cyclomatic complexity of 10 as well, and the refactor did nothing.p  pOr maybe the problem is simpler  Im running PHPMD through a continuous integration set up with Jenkins. Could there be an issue where PHPMD is not using the most recent code I have had somewhat similar issues where it will flag a class as having too many lines, after I had already refactored the class below the line number limit.p

Negative 231 pIm maintaining a legacy C Winform application, using .NET 4.0 framework.  The application works fine, but occasionally due to bugs in the application, the application will fail to work properly when the the application creates invalid data in the database.p  pAt certain points, we bind the invalidcorrupt data to a datagrid, which causes numerous errors when it attempts to map a null column to a datagrid column.p  blockquote   pAn exception of type System.InvalidCastException occurred in mscorlib.dll but was not handled in user codep      pAdditional information Object cannot be cast from DBNull to other types.p blockquote  pAs well asp  blockquote   pAn exception of type System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException occurred in System.Windows.Forms.dll but was not handled in user codep blockquote  pThe errors cause a nice popup to show when run under the Visual Studio debugger detailing the error as well as allowing me to see the line where the error occurred.p  pIn this particular case, I know what the issue is, so I can easily correct it.  However, this class of error occurs toooften in other parts of the application, so its not always obvious what is happening, and my users dont always provide good error reports.  To try and combat this, Id like to add logging to the application using log4net, which works in our situation as each user has their own copy of the application so I can obtain peruser logs after the fact.p  pUsing hints from stackoverflow as well as various other sources, I found a lot of good information on setting up handlers for these unhandled exceptions.

However, at no point is ExceptionLogger being called, either running standalone or inside the debugger, and there is no visual indication that any error occurred.  Because the exceptions are being suppressed, the users sometimes dont realize until much too late that everything theyve done is completely screwed up and the data is even more corrupt.p  pThe application platform is being built and run on x86 apparently exceptions can be lost if run on x64, and the application has been tested on both 64bit and 32bit platforms with no change in behavior.p

My data frame looks like thisp  precodeparticipant group   sound   lang    resp  advf03      adv     a       in      1 advf03      adv     a       sp      0 advf03      adv     a       in      1 advf03      adv     a       sp      0 advf03      adv     a       in      0 advf03      adv     a       sp      1 advf03      adv     a       sp      0 advf03      adv     a       in      1 advf03      adv     a       in      0 advf03      adv     a       in      1 begf03      beg     a       in      1 begf03      beg     a       in      1 begf03      beg     a       sp      0 codepre  pGroup has 3 levels adv, int, and beg. Sound has 3 levels a, e, i. Lang has 2 levels in, sp. A 1 implies a correct response and a 0 implies an incorrect response.

Negative 231 pI am trying to implement something like google public alerts at institutional level.p  pI will be displaying the institution map on the home page and if theres an event , Im trying to insert a marker for that event dynamically i.e., without the user having to refresh the map.p  pUnfortunately to do this, I have to use a technology called IFMAP, which forces me to use a cgi script that keeps on repeating cycles till an interrupt is passed.p  pso this is how my flow isp  ol liweb page with google map and ajax script that calls my cgi script for data about the markersli lia perl  cgi script that keeps polling the IFMAP database for any updates on alerts around the campus. by the end of every polling cycle, It returns some data for the web page to bring up markers.li ol  pthe problem i am facing is,p  pthe web page doesnt bring up the markers until the cgi script finishes its execution.p  pIs it possible to insert dynamic alerts on a map using my approach if yes, can you please suggest me how if no, Ive heard about something called socket.io and node.js which make my connection stateful. can these technologies help me work things outp  pThanks.p
Negative 231 pI am trying to download a canvas to my computer as an image, I can get this working fine while inspecting the element within chrome by editing the generated html via kinetic.js, simply adding idcanvas to the canvas. However I cannot find how to do this through the code itself.p  pI know that each time I create a new kinetic layer I am essentially creating a new canvas class but am unsure of how to add an id or if it is doable.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated,p  pMelissap  pHTMLp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt lttitlegtTest Pagelttitlegt ltstylegt   body      margin 0px     padding 0px

Negative 231 pI am trying to convert a threecolumn webpage layout from HTML tables to CSS, but there is one characteristic which I have so far been unable to replicate.p  pThe HTML solution allows a photograph to be placed by php into a column to the right of the main text, but in the absence of a photograph, that column collapses, and the main text content extends up to a final righthand spacing column to maintain a righthand margin.p  pSo far, the only way I have found of achieving the threecolumn array in CSS is to use a container of fixed width, and to use fixed width styles for the div tags defining the columns, together with floats.  The basis of the HTML code isp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt ltdiv classtitlestripgtltimg srcheadlinetext.pnggtltdivgt ltdiv classhdrimgspacegtltimg srcleafheader.jpggtltdivgt ltdiv classlhcolgtltp aligncentergtADMINISTRATIONltbrgt[WEBMASTER]ltpgtltdivgt ltdiv classmaincontentgtltpgtThis is the location for the main administrative page content, and will hopefully be able to contain all the necessary text, even if it  overrunsltpgtltdivgt ltdiv classrhimagegtltimg classrh srcphoto.jpggtltdivgt ltbr styleclear bothgtltdivgt codepre  pand the core CSS styling isp  precodebody  margin 0px padding 0px backgroundcolor 200542  p color CCCCCC fontfamily arial, sansserif fontsize 14pt lineheight1.4em  .container  width 1000px minheight 600px maxheight 2200px margin 8px auto 0 auto background 333333 padding 0px  .maincontent   float left minheight 600px maxheight 2000px marginleft 0px width 516px paddingtop 20px background 333333  .lhcol  float left width 200px minheight 600px maxheight 2000px paddingtop 20px paddingleft 20px paddingright 24px margin 0 background 333333  .rhimage   width 200px minheight 620px maxheight 2000px float right paddingtop 20px paddingleft 20px paddingright 20px background 333333  img  display block  .rh  margintop 40px  codepre  pBecause the columns are fixed width, the removal of the image tag leaves a wide gap to the right of the main text, and none of the suggestions I have found in web searches shows a satisfactory solution  generally the collapse of the righthand column leaves the text layout in the centre column unchanged, despite the apparent availability of more space.p  pI want to avoid solutions which would give problems with browser compatibility  is there any way of achieving what I want in CSS, or shall I have to persist with the now deprecated use of the HTML table tagp  pPeter N.p

One is the super class which is graph and 3 subclasses called Edge, DirectedGraph, and BipartiteGraph.p  pI am having some trouble with creating a bipartite graph. Specifically I am given these directionsp  blockquote   pExtend the Graph class to create a new BipartiteGraph class. It should   inherit all the functionality of the super classp      ul   lipAutomatically designate all evenindex vertices 0,2,4 as part of   the A partition from class and all oddindex vertices 1,3,5 as   part of the B partition. This requires no new code, just a   conceptual expectation.pli   lipOverride the constructor for Graph to have the same input number of vertices, call the super constructor, and then verify the graph is bipartite. That is, make sure that all existing edges are from a vertex in A to a vertex in B. If the graph is not bipartite, wipe out the internal representation e.g., for an adjacency matrix, make a size 0x0 array so it cannot be usedpli   lipAdd a method setPreferences that takes as a parameter an integer and an array or ArrayList of integers. The first integer is the vertex we want to attach preferences to and the list is that list of preferences, from most to least preferred. Verify that the array of ints contains all the members of the other partition in some order then save that information you will need a 1D array of arraysArrayLists to store these lists, one per vertex.pli   lipAdd the method stableMatching that has no parameters and returns a stable matching in the form of an ArrayList of Pairs of ints.

Negative 231 pI have 3 tabs that come into play for the particular issue that I am trying to automate using VBA.p  pForm tab  Users select from a drop down list up to 10 different entities that they need access to Range A25A34p  pFLS Hiearchy This tab is a hiearchy of all of the entities within the company beginning with level 1 highest  parent level to level 10 lowest child level.  Range AD Column A is the level, B is the entity which will match the various entities selected in dropdown on Form tab, Column C is Entity Description, Column D is the Sec Class which needs to be copied over to sheet 1.  p  pSheet1  This tab is for the admin and is to be used to Find the necessary security classes from the FLS Hiearchy tab based upon the entities selected in the form tab. Range A1J1.  Security classes are to be copied beneath each variable as derived from the Form tab up to 10 entities, correlating to Column J on Sheet1.p  pI know that I need to create a loop of some kind to accomplish this.  In a nutshell the VBA script needs to identify the entities up to 10 from the Form tab, paste them in the Range A1J1 as necessary, and then go through a loop where it takes the corresponding entities beginning with A1 and find the entities in the FLS Hieararchy tab.  Once it finds each entity in the Hierarchy tab it needs to determine its level column A on Hierarchy tab.  If the level is level 6 for example, the VBA script needs to grab the security class for that line where the entity was found and then grab the security class for the entities below it until it finds the next level 6 security class and then it needs to stop there go up one row to not include the next level 6.  In this example if you find a level 6 and the next entity below it is also a 6 the VBA script only needs to grab the one security class column d for the first variable.p  pBelow is what I have so far, but I am obviously needing a lot more help to finish.p  precodeSub SecurityClasses   SecurityClasses Macro  Based off entity selected in Form tab determine the security classes needed for user.

For each of these string I create a sequence that would typically look like this  p  precode             [B, T, S, X, P, V, E,]   ,           [B, T, S, X, P, V, E,] B gt value  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,]   ,  target  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,] P gt value  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,]   ,  target  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,] V gt value  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,]   ,  target  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,] V gt value  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,]   ,  target  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,] E gt E is ignored for now because it marks the end codepre  pas you can see the value is just a 7d vector representing the current letter and the target is the next letter in the Reber word. p  pHere is the code Im trying to run  p  precodeusrbinpython  import reberGrammar as reber import random as rnd  from pylab import   from pybrain.supervised          import RPropMinusTrainer from pybrain.supervised          import BackpropTrainer  from pybrain.datasets            import SequenceClassificationDataSet from pybrain.structure.modules   import LSTMLayer, SoftmaxLayer from pybrain.tools.validation    import testOnSequenceData from pybrain.tools.shortcuts     import buildNetwork  def reberToListIntword e.g. BPVVE gt [0,4,3,3,5]     out  [None]lenword      for i,l in enumerateword         if l  B             out[i]  0         elif l  T             out[i]  1         elif l  S             out[i]  2         elif l  V             out[i]  3         elif l  P             out[i]  4         elif l  E             out[i]  5         else              out[i]  6      return out  def buildReberDataSetnumSample     Generate a 7 class dataset      reberLexicon  reber.ReberGrammarLexiconnumSample      DS  SequenceClassificationDataSet7, 7, nbclasses7      for rw in reberLexicon.lexicon          DS.newSequence         rw2  reberToListIntrw         for i in rangelenrw21 inserting one letter at a time              inpt  outpt  [0.0]7             inpt[rw2[i]]1.0             outpt[rw2[i1]]1.0             DS.addSampleinpt,outpt      return DS  def printDataSetDS, numLines just to print some stat     print t     print Number of sequences ,DS.getNumSequences     print Input and output dimensions , DS.indim,t, DS.outdim     print n     for i in rangenumLines         for inp, target in DS.getSequenceIteratori             print inp,         print n     print t  Dataset creation  split into training and test sets  fullDS  buildReberDataSet700  tstdata, trndata  fullDS.splitWithProportion 0.25  trndata.convertToOneOfMany bounds[0.,1.] tstdata.convertToOneOfMany bounds[0.,1.]  printDataSettrndata,2  Network setup  training  rnn  buildNetwork trndata.indim, 7, trndata.outdim, hiddenclassLSTMLayer, outclassSoftmaxLayer, outputbiasFalse, recurrentTrue trainer  RPropMinusTrainer rnn, datasettrndata, verboseTrue  trainer  BackpropTrainer rnn, datasettrndata, verboseTrue, momentum0.9, learningrate0.5    trainError[] testError []  errors  trainer.trainUntilConvergence   for i in range9     trainer.trainEpochs 2      trainError.append100.  1.0testOnSequenceDatarnn, trndata     testError.append100.  1.0testOnSequenceDatarnn, tstdata     print train error 5.2f  trainError[i], ,  test error 5.2f  testError[i]  plottrainError holdTrue plottestError show codepre  pI fail to train this net.

Negative 231 pSo we have this bloggish site for which we are building a codebetter URL schemecode. The basic idea is to convert the URLs to a codehuman and SEO friendly structurecode. I have a function which generates the codeURL slugcode based on the title of the posting. p  pA record looks kind of like this in the database nowp  precode    postid         posttitle              posturlslug             1               Hello World             helloworld     2               Another Post            anotherpost codepre  pSo now we can change p  pcodehttpltsitegtpost.cgiactionreadampid1codep  pto codehttpltsitegtpostreadhelloworldcodep  pIn order to ensure that the url is unique, we are planning to append the postid to it.p  pSo now codehttpltsitegtpostreadhelloworldcode p  pbecomes codehttpltsitegtpostreadhelloworld1codep  pAll of this works very well. My main question is how should we handle the situation if the blog poster edits his title We wouldnt want codehelloworld1code to be showing a totally unrelated post. p  pThe obvious solution is to recreate the slug when the title is edited. But how will we handle user codebookmarksgoogle trackingSEO crawlingcode We could do a code301 redirectcode, but keeping a whole history of URL slug changes and redirecting them like that can quickly become unmanageable. p  pAlso I would really prefer keeping the routingrewritingredirections within the application and not a custom on the fly .htaccess or something. The reason being that if it is in the application and something goes wrong only some users will have issues, but we all know what happens when files like code.htaccesscode catches firep  pDoes anyone have any insightexperience managing such scenario Any inputs are very welcomep

Negative 231 pIm given a directory with sub directories and about 300000 different kinds of text files in there. All related to some production project, changing its architecture isnt an option.p  pSome tasks require replacing specific strings everywhere they occur. Using codegrepcode and codesedcode takes about 5 minutes for every such a replace. Using codefindcode and codesedcode takes a lot more time...p  pHowever, PhpStorm takes some time to index all the files while opening this directory, but after that searching and replacing in all the files with PhpStorm is blazing fastp  pIs it possible to achieve a similar behaviour remaining in terminal emulator To index somehow all files in a given directory for a fast searchampreplace after thatp  pTrying to google around I found some tools like codecscopecode, codeidutilscode, codeseascopecode, but as far as I could check there are serious limitations like search only without an obvious way to replace, or indexing only source files for functions, keywords, etc... p  pWhat Im looking for is a way to index all the files for fast searchampreplace with auto updated index. Like in PhpStorm but terminal way and open source.p  pThanksp

Negative 231 pI am porting some software from the gcctoolchain to the armcctoolchain processor stays the same CortexA9. In the Ccode memcpy is used. armcc replaces a call to memcpy by a call to aeabimemcpy. The FAQ sais the following about aeabimemcpy a hrefhttpinfocenter.arm.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.arm.doc.faqska3934.html relnofollowHow do the ARM Compilers handle memcpya p  blockquote   pIn many cases, when compiling calls to memcpy, the ARM C compiler will generate calls to specialized, optimised, library functions instead. Since RVCT 2.1, these specialized functions are part of the ABI for the ARM architecture AEABI, and includep blockquote  precodeaeabimemcpy This function is the same as ANSI C memcpy, except that the return value is void. codepre  pBut in contrast to gcc, where a call to memcpy works fine in all of my cases, with armcc the call to memcpy respectivly aeabimemcpy continuously produces alignment exceptions. Meanwhile I found out, that a call to memcpy can handle calls where source and destination address are not 4byte aligned, but only if they are both not 4byte aligned. For examplep  precode    volatile uint32t len  10     uint8t src  uint8t0x06000002          2byte aligned     uint8t dst  uint8t0x06000002  20   2byte aligned     memcpydst, src, len codepre  pwill work. But for example p  precode    volatile uint32t len  10     uint8t src  uint8t0x06000002          2byte aligned     uint8t dst  uint8t0x06000002  22   4byte aligned     memcpydst, src, len codepre  pwill cause an alignment exception. SInce I am using pointers of type uint8t I explicitly tell the compiler that the addresses can have any alignment. But obviously this aeabimemcpy can not handle every combination of alignments. How can I solve this problem preferably without changing all calls to memcpy in the existing code with a userspecific version of memcpy Thanks for help. p

Negative 231 pEDIT Some changes, because I think there are some misunderstandings.p  pLets say I have a codeMainWindowcode class as a part of my programs gui. With a codeFileChoosercode dialog I want to load a image file into my program. At the moment I get the filename of the choosen file, construct an codeImagecode object which hides the loading logic and want to store it as a part of my codeMainWindowcode class. My question is, how would you store the object. I know that there is only one loaded image at the same time, so the use of container formats like codestdvectorcode seems not very useful for me. p  pMy thoughs werep  pto use a nonpointer member. But thats difficult, because Im not able to construct the codeImagecode object at the construct time of the codeMainWindowcode class. p  pto use codeuniqueptrcode, because I would say its ok when the codeMainWindowcode takes ownership, but Im not sure if thats very useful when I have to pass the pointer around to objectswidgets that can show some specific contens of the datasets. p  pto use codesharedptrcode in this case to allow child widgets to store their own pointer to the codeImagecode objectp  pI know its a noobish question, but I have no good ideas at the moment.p

Negative 231 pI am fully aware that Swift doesnt have a trycatch mechanism to catch exceptions OK, Swift 2.0 now supports them. I also understand that many API methods return a NSError that will be filled with an error object if something goes wrong. So please dont point me to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24010569errorhandlinginswiftlanguageErrorHandling in SwiftLanguageap  pBut this still doesnt explain how to react to runtime errors in your own code, like arrayoutofbounds accesses or forceunwrapping an optional value that is nil.

While debugging, Xcode can show us those, but what if this happens to an enduser or betatester In pure C there is signal handling and it could be used in ObjectiveC as well. Is there something like this in Swift A centralized callback entered just before the app diesp  pUpdatep  pLet me rephrase the question in a large project, it is not feasible to manually check for the above errors on every loop and forceunwrapping. When a runtime error does happen eventually, is there a callback like Objective Cs segfault handling or NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler that will get called so that the error can be loggedemailed together with a stacktrace of the crashp

I dont need to validate the JSON itself thats being produced by AWS, so Im assuming its good, and even if its not, I cant change it, so theres no good reason to go through all the overhead of parsing it out.p  pThat said, can I do this more efficiently with a regex, or would I have to go down to the level of finding the first occurence of identifierS , then the next occurence of , after that, and get the substring between the two  I was trying to do something with coder.findFirstIncode but I cant figure out a way to extract the group I want from that.p  pOr is there some other super efficient thing Im not aware of that I could be doingp

Negative 231 pSo what I understood after upgrading my flyway version because of some requirements is that flywaycore2.2 introduced some validation for Flyway placeholders.p  pNow, the convention of placeholder syntax is name uniform across most libraries. In our migration scripts, we are inserting a string in a mysql table column called stretchySql and that string holds some placeholder elements of our own which is meant to be interpreted at runtime by the application layer.p  pcode UPDATE stretchyparameter SET parametersqlselect  r.id as reportid from stretchyreport r where r.reportcategory  reportCategory codep  pI dont want flyway to interpret something embedded in a string as its own placeholder and throw an error. So basically, is there some way to switch off flyway placeholder validationsince we dont use it without reverting back to an older versionp

I would like to be able to have a setting that when set to true means that a holding or maintenance page is displayed on the front end website.p  pMy routes configuration is currently in a yaml file and is read on on each request.

Or it could change the routes so that there is only one.p  pI have thought that this could be done with different files being loaded based on the setting but then means that all routes are static and cannot be retrieved from a database for example.

Ive implemented and binded the needed delegate and dataSource protocols and checked that their methods are actually being called and working.

So here is a list what Ive checkedp  ol liData binding is working and data is available. Ive also cross checked this with a second UITableView that is in the project and is working properly.

Negative 231 pI am currently working on a software that uses RabbitMQ to deliver messages to workers. Basically, this is quite an easy task, as you can use a single direct exchange with a single queue, and all the workers consume that queue. Job done.p  pBut now, things start to get complicated. If have two additional requirements, that make me thinkp  ul liThe messages are not all equal, i.e. messages have a flag, which is used to group messages. Now the first requirement is that all messages with the same flag are processed inorder.li liIt is desired to pause processing of all messages with a specific flag.li ul  pThe first one is quite easy to solve You simply have to make sure that messages with the same flag are always processed by the same worker, and set its prefetch to 1. To make that sure you can use an codexconsistenthashcode exchange.p  pThe second one is also easy to solve You simple have to use a separate queue for each flag, then you can stop processing a queue.p  pNow, while this basically works, it introduces a few problems, and Im not too sure how to solve themp  ul liIf I set the codeprefetchcode option to 1, things become slower, as I cant process messages in parallel. This highly decreases performance.li liIf I use a separate queue for each flag, I end up with a high number of queues  10k. While this does not seem to be a problem for RabbitMQ to handle, I wonder whether its a good idea.li liAdditionally, I now have multiple worker steps, i.e. once a message has been handled by a worker, it puts it to another RabbitMQ, and the same thing starts over. This means, if I do not use separate instances of RabbitMQ for each step, I end up with emlotsem of queues emn exchangesem and emn times 10kem queues.li ul  pIs there a better way to solve this If so, how Any ideas, hints, p

Negative 231 pSo Im trying to randomly select different images from my html that are currently hidden with css and make them slide from one side to the other and disappear,this animation should keep working until the user clicks a stop button. I managed to make it work for a single image at the time, but I can not seem to figure out how to make it work for multiple images at the same time. As when a slide is called again the function that slides the image is still sliding the last image, so it leaves the last image frozen and goes with the new one. So how can I make it so the function moveIt finishes sliding the image but also accepts and slides a new image at the same timep  pNewbie here, hope that wasnt too confusingp  precodefunction slide       randomImage     var top  Math.floorMath.random  100  1       image.csstop, top         image.cssdisplay, inline     moveIt     mar  25     ana  setTimeoutslide, 1000  var imagesright  [f1r, f2r, f3r, f4r, f5r, f6r, f7r, f8r, f9r, f10r] var imagesleft  [f1l, f2l, f3l, f4l, f5l, f6l, f7l, f8l, f9l, f10l] var mar  25 var a   var image    function randomImage      image  imagesright[Math.floorMath.random  10]   function moveIt      if mar gt 100          stopIt      else          mar  mar  0.3           image.cssmarginleft, mar            stopmoveIt  setTimeoutmoveIt, 10   function stopIt      clearTimeoutstopmoveIt  codepre

Negative 231 pIm currently trying to enable or disable validation if certain conditions. If the startdate or enddate has something entered it will validate both fields to check if valid, if startdate is entered then enddate must be too and vice versa.

Negative 231 pMy application uses a genetic algorithm for evolving neural networks. In developing unit tests for the randomised mutation algorithm I wish to ensure that for given random values the correct mutations occur.p  pIn the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12877260unittestingalgorithmsthatinvolverandomnumbersherea the most popular answer to the question of unit testing algorithms that involve randomness is to use mocking. This seems very sensible to me but my question is whether anyone has solid suggestions about how to do this.p  pHere is how I currently achieve this. I define an codeinterfacecode for my randomness generator highly simplified here for illustration purposesp  precodepublic interface Mutator      float randomSynapseWeightChange     float randomSynapseThresholdChange   In the main application this interface has an implementation that wraps Random. In my unit testing framework I use  public class TestMutator implements Mutator      ListltFloatgt synapseWeightChanges  new ArrayListltgt     public void addTestSynapseWeightChangefloat weightChange          synapseWeightChanges.addweightChange          public float randomSynapseWeightChange          return synapseWeightChanges.remove       codepre  pMy unit tests then look likep  precodeTest public void testDecreaseSynapseWeightMutation      TestMutator mutator  new TestMutator     mutator.addTestSynapseWeightChange0.5     world.setMutatormutator     Synapse synapse  new Synapsenew Neuron, 0.1     synapse.mutate     assertEqualsWeight has decreased during mutation, 0.4, synapse.getWeight  codepre  pThis is really not a particularly elegant solution. The unit test relies on knowing how many random numbers the code is going to need. For tests that involve several mock random numbers being pushed onto the list it pretty unclear when reading it later what each of the numbers of for.p  pSo my question is has anyone come across a neater way of doing this Would I be better off having an enum to define the different domains of randomness or even different classes of Mutators to document the meaning of the mocked numbers better p

But I think builds checkin policy that does not work because any file that prevents successful build for example there is a syntax error in this file and project cannot be built can be checked in. I can check in all broken files although builds check in policy is added. So I need your help, I dont want broken code in tfs.p

But if im right this is by design of digest auth because i have not found a way to tell the client that the other side is using digest auth. I was able to specify this kind of information in my other .Net projects but for some reason Microsoft changed the code and namespace for the codeHttpClientcode. I am also aware of the codeHttpClientcode in the original namespace that you can get through nuget but this is not working for me as i get an error in my output window as soon as i make any call. This closes my app without any kind of information.p  pBack to the log i was able to get some information with the help of the extended logging and the tool to analyze them. The error is something like cant access it right now will edit it laterInvalid token passed to functionmethod.p  pI really hope that someone can help me to solve this problem as it makes the app nearly unusable. My users have to restart the app every 15 Minutes to be on the save site.p  pThanks for all advices that help me.p

Negative 231 pIm playing an audio stream from the internet in my app, and I would like to display a graphic equalizer. The library that Im using for the streaming is codeFreeStreamercode. For drawing the graphic equalizer Im using codeZLHistogramAudioPlotcode. These two libraries are the only ones that fit my needs. The problem is I cant get them to work together.p  pThe codeZLHistogramAudioPlotcode requires a buffer and bufferSize in order to update its view. Here is its update methodp  precode voidupdateBufferfloat buffer withBufferSizeUInt32bufferSize      [self setSampleDatabuffer lengthbufferSize]  codepre  pUnfortunately, the codeFreeStreamercode library doesnt provide a method to read the audiot output as it goes out towards the sound card.

Negative 231 pI have a QTableWidget filled with different QWidgets such that whenever I get a message from the server to addupdate them I do so like thisp  precodeuigttableWidgetgtsetRowCountdata.count uigttableWidgetgtsetCellWidgetdata.count  1, 0, new QCheckBoxEnabled uigttableWidgetgtsetCellWidgetdata.count  1, 1, new QLineEditADD     uigttableWidgetgtsetCellWidgetdata.count  1, 2, new QComboBox          uigttableWidgetgtsetCellWidgetdata.count  1, 3, new QLineEdit232434  uigttableWidgetgtsetCellWidgetdata.count  1, 4, new QComboBox          codepre  pThen with those widgets I signalslot connect them in the next method like thisp  precodefor int i  0 i lt TWCNT i    connectQComboBoxuigttableWidgetgtcellWidgetcnt, i, SIGNALcurrentIndexChangedint, this, SLOTcboxchangedint   if i  0        stuff     connectQCheckBoxuigttableWidgetgtcellWidgetcnt, i, SIGNALstateChangedint, this, SLOTcheckchangedint      if i  1        stuff     connectQComboBoxuigttableWidgetgtcellWidgetcnt, i, SIGNALcurrentIndexChangedint, this, SLOTcboxchangedint     connectQComboBoxuigttableWidgetgtcellWidgetcnt, i, SIGNALcurrentTextChangedQString, this, SLOTcboxeditedQString      ....  codepre  pLater when I want to remove stuff from tableWidget, I do so by calling removeRow on the row I no longer need. The issue here is that these widgets still seem to stay children of the uitableWidgetviewport and they never get deleted even if I call deleteLater on them. Deleting them with delete just causes my program to crash, and adding more rows after each row removal is causing my memory usage to skyrocket.p  pIve been stuck on this for a few days, so any help is appreciatedp

Negative 231 pWere using an Oracle Database with .Net stored procedures. For this to work, there is an entry to EXTPROC in the Oracle TNS configuration that handles the requests for the .Net procedures.p  pWhen I try to access such a procedure via SQLDeveloper directly from the database, the extproc process is created if not already present and then kept alive, this is working as intended since its configured that way in the Windows registry.p  pHowever, when I route a call via ORDS, Oracle RESTful Data Services, it spawns a new process of the extproc instance for each request and after serving the request the extproc process is shut down. This makes it very hard to debug since I cannot attach to the process via remote debugger and is also a big performance hit, increasing even simple requests duration from 50ms to 4 seconds.p  pIt worked as expected on an 11g database, now its running on a 12c.p  pIs there a known issue in ORDS 2.10 or a configuration I have not yet seen that would solve this p

Negative 231 pRedis Sentinel manual failover command timesoutp  pI have one Redis master, one slave, and one Sentinel monitoring them.  Everything seems to be working properly including failover when the master is killed.  But when I issue the SENTINEL FAILVER command Sentinel gets stuck in the state failoverstatewaitpromotion for a few minutes.  It seems like the Slave is not getting the promotion command.  This doesnt make sense because there doesnt seem to be any trouble with network communication from the Sentinel host to either of the Redis hosts.  Im running all 3 of the procs in Docker containers, but Im not sure how that could cause the problem.  I can run rediscli from the Sentinel host i.e. from inside the Docker container and can remotely execute the slaveof command.  I can also monitor both Redis instances and see SENTINEL pings and info requests.  I looked at logs for the master and slave and see nothing abnormal.  Looking at a hrefhttpsgithub.comantirezredisissues1796 relnofollowTHISa post and there does not seem to be any reason why Sentinel would consider the Redis instances invalid.p  pIm fairly experienced with Sentinel, but rather new to Docker.

Negative 231 pI am using IntelliJ GUI Designer to generate a GUI application firsttimeuser. I tried generating some small example UIs and was able to do it.

Negative 231 pHi Im currently working on a side project. In this project Ill have a central server that will need to connect to several remote docker daemons. My problem is with authentication.p  pGiven that the project will be hosted on Digitalocean, my first thought suggested that Ill accept only connections from the private networking interface. The problem is that that interface is accessible by all other servers in the same datacenter.p  pSecond thought is to allow only requests from the central server using the DOCKERHOST config, the problem is that if I understand correctly the if the private IP of the centeral server get known, the IP can be spoofed. p  pThird thought is to enable TLS  a hrefhttpsdocs.docker.comarticleshttps relnofollowhttpsdocs.docker.comarticleshttpsa , Ive never dealt with those things before and the tutorial is unclear for me, I lack the knowledge of the terminologies and its being used heavily.p  pSo basically the problem is that I have a central client and multiple remote docker hosts, what is the best way to connect to them Thank you.p  pEDIT I managed to solve the problem using HTTP authentication by running nginx as a proxy in front of the docker daemon.p

Negative 231 pIm writing a project with React, Flux, and ReactRouter with Browserify. I use all three dependencies from a CDN over their NPM packages because the filesize of the project even after being minified was ridiculous for the amount of code I had written. Id like to be able to use Router components and BrowserHistory, but neither of them can be used from ReactRouters browser release. Is there any way I can use them without needing to rewrite them, or maybe use an alternative that can deal with HTML5 history and more complex routing without needing to be bundled with the rest of the project to workp

Negative 231 pEssentially, my View hierarchy isp  precodeHomeViewController   ContainerView1     TableView   ContainerView2   ContainerView3   PageController   ScrollView codepre  pAll the elements I listed above are in storyboard. Im trying to use ScrollView to page through the three container views I have stacked over each other. So I adapted a tutorial I found on RayW, but its a bit different since most of the tutorials on this have container views programmatically created as opposed to what Im trying to do, which is have it created in Storyboard so I have control of the content within each page. Anyways, I delegated the scroll view, and created outlets of my container views.

Negative 231 pOpenshift offers scalability. However, it seems to me, if you are using MySql, in the end MySql querieshits will be the bottleneck if you are lucky enough to generate traffic which need scalability and considering the maxconnections limit on openshift.p  pSuppose I want to use OpenShift, is it possible to create multiple mysql cartridges to balance the load and create dynamic environmental variables to assign requests to different mySql cartridges suppose I send an id or something and the environment variable for the mysql is set to dbnamelastdigit of this id.p  pThis is a simplified example which should multiply the database capacity by ten if this is unrelated data. Can it be done  p  pI hope some openshift guy or girl will clarify this for me....p  pcheersp  pEdit Thanks mbaird for your infop  pTo clarify   I wasnt talking about autoscaling but using for instance 11 staticpersistant dbcartridges which would never scale up or down. p  pThen you could store user information in any of them depending on also for instance their last iddigit.   The 11th database cartride could be used as a table to get the users id and then redirect that user to the right database if last digit  0, db  db0, if last digit  1, db  db1 etc. This would enable me to call the right database for the right user.p  pOf course, this is not autoscaling but it would multiply the database capacity by roughly ten.p  pHowever, this would require the ability to create multiple mysql cartridges and corresponding environmental variables to gain access to all these mysql cartridges.p  pIt seems to me this not possible right now, so I will investigate your suggestions.p

Negative 231 pIm hoping this can be done with flexbox and not require too much trickery.p  pWhat Im looking forp  p1 One large block, with two smaller ones next to it that rowspan, without having to have their own nested wrap. a hrefhttpcodepen.iovkjgrpenOPRPRR relnofollowWorking Exampleap  p2 Percentage width that resizes at a fixed aspect ratio, probably using the paddingtopbottom trick. This can either be defined on just the large block, the smaller ones, or both. I say eitherorand because I dont really care so much that the smaller block match the aspect ratio of the larger one. Perhaps the aspect ratio could only be applied to the larger block, and the smaller ones would flex to the height. That would be fine, as long as they all resize together, relative to the width of the container. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsxxbqtnb7 relnofollowWorking Exampleap  pThat last bit is where Im hitting the major road block. The first example with a rowspan looks great, but relies on the wrap having a defined height, which breaks the responsiveness.
