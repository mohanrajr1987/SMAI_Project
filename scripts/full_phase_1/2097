Positive 2097 pWhile reading Eric Nieblers a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2015n4382.pdfrange proposala,br Ive come across the term sentinel as replacement for the end iterator.br Im having a difficult time understanding the benefits of sentinel over an end iterator.br Could some provide a clear example of what sentintel brings to the table that can not be done with standard iterator pairsp  blockquote   pA strongsentinelstrong is an abstraction of a pasttheend iterator. Sentinels are   Regular types that can be used to denote the end of a range. A   sentinel and an iterator denoting a range shall be EqualityComparable.   A sentinel denotes an element when an iterator i compares equal to the   sentinel, and i points to that element.

Positive 2097 pOk. So this is a very specific implementation of the remove method in the iterator interface. So we have a Bag class that keeps tracks of the strings being added into an ArrayList defined inside. Lets call the instance field ArrayList stringHolder.

Positive 2097 pI am having some difficulty grasping this concept. From this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8627373whatdatastructureexactlyaredequesincthreada here it statesp  blockquote   pA deque requires that any insertion to the front or back shall keep   any reference to a member element valid. Its OK for iterators to be   invalidated, but the members themselves must stay in the same place in   memory.p blockquote  pI was under the impression from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32793784doesapointerbecomeinvalidatedifaniteratorisinvalidatedinstlcontainer3279412132794121thisa thread which statesp  blockquote   pA pointer is actually a type of iterator. In fact, for some container types, the corresponding iterator can be   implemented simply as a pointer.p      pIf we have a pointer and an iterator that each reference the same   element of a container, then any operation that invalidates one will   invalidate the other.p blockquote  pso if an iterator becomes invalidated then references also become invalidated.  My question is how is that possible. If the iterator which points to a certain memory address becomes invalidated how can a reference to that address be valid p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI understand that a deque is implemented by random chunks of memory and these chunks of memory are tracked by an independant data structure such as a dynamic array. However i am having difficulty understanding how an iterator could be invalid but a reference could be valid since essentially an iterator is a generalized pointer for the contents of the data structure. This makes me think that an iterator might be pointing to something else while a pointer points to the actual item  Consider the following diagram of a vector .p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comvVU16.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvVU16.png altenter image description hereap  pFrom what i understand in the diagram above for a vector its that if content of a pointer changes the iterator also changes. How is that different for a deque . p

Positive 2097 pI am trying to understand the concept of iterator invalidation in vectors. From some of the reading I have done I have found that if a vector contains say 7 elements and you delete the element on the 5th index then the iterators from 5th element onwards become invalidated.

Positive 2097 pHeres something Ive always wondered about.  Ill pose the question for Python, but I would also welcome answers which address the standard libraries in Java and C.p  pLets say you have a Python list called mylist, and you would like to iterate over its stronguniquestrong elements.  There are two natural approachesp  precodeiterate over set for x in setmylist     dosomethingx codepre  porp  precodelist to set to list for x in listsetmylist     dosomethingx codepre  pThe tension is that iterating over a list is faster than iterating over a set, but it takes time to convert a set to a list.  My guess is that the answer to this question will depend on a number of factors, such asp  ul liHow many times will we need to iterateli liHow big is the original listli liHow many repetitions in the original list should we expectli ul  pSo I guess Im looking for a rule of thumb of the form If the list has x many elements with each element repeated no more than y times and you only need to iterate z times then you should iterate over the set otherwise you should convert it to a list.p

Positive 2097 pIn Herb Sutters a hrefhttpwww.gotw.capublicationsmill09.htmcodeWhen Is a Container Not a Containercodea, he shows an example of taking a pointer into a containerp  precode   Example 1 Is this code valid safe good      vectorltchargt v     ...    char p  ampv[0]     ... do something with p ... codepre  pThen follows it up with an improvementp  precode   Example 1b An improvement                  when its possible      vectorltchargt v     ...    vectorltchargtiterator i  v.begin     ... do something with i ... codepre  pBut doesnt really provide a convincing argumentp  blockquote   pIn general, its not a bad guideline to prefer using iterators instead   of pointers when you want to point at an object thats inside a   container. After all, iterators are invalidated at mostly the same   times and the same ways as pointers, and one reason that iterators   exist is to provide a way to point at a contained object. So, if you   have a choice, prefer to use iterators into containers.p      pUnfortunately, you cant always get the same effect with iterators   that you can with pointers into a container. There are two main   potential drawbacks to the iterator method, and when either applies we   have to continue to use pointersp      ol   lipYou cant always conveniently use an iterator where you can use a pointer. See example below.pli   lipUsing iterators might incur extra space and performance overhead, in cases where the iterator is an object and not just a bald   pointer.pli   ol blockquote  pIn the case of a vector, the iterator is just a RandomAccessIterator. For all intents and purposes this is a thin wrapper over a pointer. One implementation even acknowledges thisp  precode    This iterator adapter is normal in the sense that it does not     change the semantics of any of the operators of its iterator     parameter.  Its primary purpose is to convert an iterator that is     not a class, e.g. a pointer, into an iterator that is a class.     The Container parameter exists solely so that different containers     using this template can instantiate different types, even if the     Iterator parameter is the same. codepre  pFurthermore, the implementation stores a member value of type codeIteratorcode, which is codepointercode or codeTcode. In other words, just a pointer. Furthermore, the codedifferencetypecode for such a type is codestdptrdifftcode and the operations defined are just thin wrappers i.e., codeoperatorcode is codepointercode, codeoperatorcode is codepointercode and so on.p  pFollowing Sutters argument, this iterator class provides no benefits over pointers, only drawbacks. Am I correctp

It may appear multiple times within that file, but as soon as it appears in two or more files, the code breaks because funcresult was already instantiated and is being overwritten, which is a nono in XSLT.p  pIf there is a way to ACTUALLY exit an EXSLT function or xslforeach loop you can assign a return variable for a function, but the function continues and foreachs are actually not loops, but more similar to function maps, that would be ideal but I have not found a way yet. p  pI have considered combining all feeds into one variable and removing the foreach loop altogether, but have had problems getting this to work from the beginning.p  pAny other possible solutions, ideas or pointers are much appreciated The file relationship here and XML is pretty hard to change, so solutions suggesting such a change are not ideal.p  pThanks in advance,br Tristan Eastburnp

Negative 2097 pIm using Instruments with the Allocations instrument.  Im testing only a fixed interaction with my app.p  pI have a navigation controller which goes 4 stages deep.  The first two stages are standard table view controllers and the last two are custom controllers with dynamically loaded images.p  pSo I run my app in instruments via Run with Performance Tool  Allocations and do the following interactions p  precode1.  App Loads 2.  I wait a bit until allocations graph stabilizes 3.  I tappush into my navigation controller until the deepest level. 4.  I wait for the images to load and for the allocations graph to stabilize. 5.  I tap back out of the navigation controller until Im back to the root level. 6.  I wait for the allocations graph to stabilize. 7.  GOTO 3. codepre  pNow what Ive noticed is that between each iteration from 3 to 7 the allocations graph shows a slightly higher value.  So the overall allocations are increasing even though Im doing the same thing and all the view controllers deallocs are being called.p  pSo the timeline looks roughly like thisp  precode1.  Start 1mb 2.  Push controllersLoad images 4mb 3.  Pop controllers 1.1mb 4.  Push controllersLoad images 4.1mb 5.  Pop controllers 1.2mb 6.  ... etc ... always increasing slightly codepre  pSo my question is does this mean I have a leak or is this normal  Also what does the allocations graph data actually represent  And why is the value increasing even though Im popping back out to the initial state  Im worried that if my app runs long enough it will consume too much memory even though all the user is doing is pushing and popping view controllers.  p  pAny thoughts would be helpful.p

Negative 2097 pI have a problem that can be simplified as follows I have a particular set of objects that I want to modify in a particular way. So, its possible for me to write a function that modifies a single object and then create a decorator that applies that function to all of the objects in the set. p  pSo, lets suppose I have something like thisp  precodedef modifyallf     def funobjs         for o in objs             fo  modifyall def modifyobj      Modify obj in some way.  modifyallmyobjs codepre  pHowever, there may also be times when I just want to operate on one object by itself. p  pIs there a way to undecorate the codemodifycode function programmatically to get the original single object function back again Without just removing the decorator, I mean. Or is there another approach that would be better to use in such a case p  pJust for clarity and completeness, theres quite a bit more going on in the emactualem codemodifyallcode decorator than is illustrated here. Both codemodifycode and codemodifyallcode have a certain amount of work to carry out, which is why I thought the decorator might be nice. Additionally, I have other variants of codemodifycode that can directly benefit from codemodifyallcode, which makes it even more useful. But I do sometimes need to do things using the original codemodifycode function. I know that I can always pass in a oneelement set to trick it into working asis, but Im wondering if theres a better way or a better design for the situation.p

Negative 2097 pIm currently working on implementing a fuzzy search for a terminology web service and Im looking for suggestions on how I might improve the current implementation. Its too much code to share, but I think an explanation might suffice to prompt thoughtful suggestions. I realize its a lot to read but Id appreciate any help. p  pFirst, the terminology is basically just a number of names or terms. For each word, we split it into tokens by space and then iterate through each character to add it to the trie. On a terminal node such as when the character y in strawberry is reached we store in a list an index to the master term list. So a terminal node can have multiple indices since the terminal node for strawberry will match strawberry and allergy to strawberry.p  pAs for the actual search, the search query is also broken up into tokens by space. The search algorithm is run for each token.  The first character of the search token must be a match so traw will never match strawberry. After that, we go through children of each successive node. If there is child with a character that matches, we continue the search with the next character of the search token. If a child does not match the given character, we look at the children using the current character of the search token so not advancing it. This is the fuzziness part, so stwb will match strawberry.p  pWhen we reach the end of the search token, we will search through the rest of the trie structure at that node to get all potential matches since the indexes to the master term list are only on the terminal nodes. We call this the roll up. We store the indices by setting their value on a BitSet. Then, we simply and the BitSets from the results of each search token result. We then  take, say, the first 1000 or 5000 indices from the anded BitSets and find the actual terms they correspond to. We use Levenshtein to score each term and then sort by score to get our final results.p  pThis works fairly well and is pretty fast. There are over 390k nodes in the tree and over 1.1 million actual term names. However, there are problems with this as it stands.p  pFor example, searching for car cat will return Catheterization, when we dont want it to since the search query is two words, the result should be at least two. That would be easy enough to check, but it doesnt take care of a situation like Catheterization Procedure, since it is two words. Ideally, wed want it to match something like Cardiac Catheterization. p  pBased on the need to correct this, we came up with some changes.  For one, we go through the trie in a mixed depthbreadth search. Essentially we go depth first as long as a character matches. Those child nodes that didnt match get added to a priority queue. The priority queue is ordered by edit distance, which can be calculated while searching the trie since if theres a character match, distance remains the same and if not, it increases by 1. By doing this, we get the edit distance for each word.  We are no longer using the BitSet. Instead, its a map of the index to a Terminfo object.  This object stores the index of the query phrase and the term phrase and the score. So if the search is car cat and a term matched is Catheterization procedure the term phrase indices will be 1 as will the query phrase indices. For Cardiac Catheterization the term phrase indices will be 1,2 as will the query phrase indices. As you can see, its very simple afterward to look at the count of term phrase indices and query phrase indices and if they arent at least equal to the search word count, they can be discarded.p  pAfter that, we add up the edit distances of the words, remove the words from the term that match the term phrase index, and count the remaining letters to get the true edit distance. For example, if you matched the term allergy to strawberries and your search query was straw you would have a score of 7 from strawberries, then youd use the term phrase index to discard strawberries from the term, and just count allergy to minus the spaces to get the score of 16.p  pThis gets us the accurate results we expect. However, it is far too slow. Where before we could get 2540 ms on one word search, now it could be as much as half a second. Its largely from things like instantiating TermInfo objects, using .add operations, .put operations and the fact that we have to return a large number of matches. We could limit each search to only return 1000 matches, but theres no guarantee that the first 1000 results for car would match any of the first 1000 matches for cat remember, there are over 1.1. million terms.p  pEven for a single query word, like cat, we still need a large number of matches. This is because if we search for cat the search is going to match car and roll up all the terminal nodes below it which will be a lot. However, if we limited the number of results, it would place too heavy an emphasis on words that begin with the query and not the edit distance. Thus, words like catheterization would be more likely to be included than something like coat.p  pSo, basically, are there any thoughts on how we could handle the problems that the second implementation fixed, but without as much of the speed slow down that it introduced I can include some selected code if it might make things clearer but I didnt want to post a giant wall of code.p

Negative 2097 pIm currently going to write big project in c11.p  pIm searching for some time good c11c reflection library and Ive found several different libraries, but most of them are simply not updated for last couple of years or their functionality is very limited.p  pCould you tell me if there is a really good library for c1c for reflection I want to have static and dynamic reflection, know as much information as I can about methods, classes etc, can dynamically add and access methods etc.p  pOr maybe c11 has provided some additional functionality that will help to better design reflection libraries and should I write it by myself I havent found information about it though.p

Negative 2097 pIt might be a silly question. Im trying to set leftright margins like the attached picture. I succeeded to implement it by adding UITextView to UIScrollView. However, I could achieve almost everything I want with UITextView alone. For example, with UIScrollView, when I manually change the text of UITextView, it automatically scrolls to bottom regardless of setting its .scrollEnabled to No. p  pIt would be perfect if a scroll indicator of UITextView appears outside UITextView. In the attached picture, lets say the red box represents the entire UITextView. I tried to change UITextViews scrollIndicatorInsets property, but a scroll indicator can be moved only inward to be visible.p  pSeveral apps such as Pages, aWriter, Plaintext achieve this feature. Could you give any suggestionp  pThank youp  pI img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8euXV.png altalt textp

Negative 2097 pI am building a complex iPad application think of it as a scrapbook.  For the purpose of this question, lets consider a page with two images over it.br My main view displays my doc data rendered as a single UIImage this because I need to do some global manipulation over them. This is my codeDisplayViewcode.br When editing I need to instantiate an codeEditorViewcode with my two images as subviews this way I can interact with a single image, rotate it, scale it, move it. When editing is triggered, I hide my codeDisplayViewcode and show my codeEditorViewcode.p  pIn a iPhone app, Id associate each main view that is, a view filling the screen to a view controller.br The problem is here there is just one view controller Ive considered passing the codeEditorViewcode via a modal view controller, but its not an option there a complex layout with a mask covering everything and palettes over it rebuilding it in the codeEditorViewcode would create duplicate code.p  pPresently the codeEditorViewcode incorporates some logic loads data from the model, invokes some subviews for fine editing, saves data back to the model codeEditorViewcode subviews also incorporate some logic I manipulate images and pass them back to the main codeEditorViewcode. I feel this logic belongs more to a controller. On the other hand, I am not sure making my only view controller so fat a good idea.p  pWhat is the best, cocoaish implementation of such a class structurebr Feel free to ask for clarifications.br Cheers.p

Is this correctli liHow can I safely raise events on one thread e.g. the listener, and have the subscribers run synchronously on another the main threadli liIt is very likely that new events will be raised before the subsequent handler is done. What will happen in this case Will the event be buffed somewhere by the CLR, or will it be ignoredli ol  pAnd last but not least I guess Im aiming for the parallel for the message ProducerConsumer paradigm, but instead of messages, I want to use events. Do you think there is a better approachp  pThanks,p  pBoazp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI want to explain my motivation for using events in the first place. The application is an automated trading engine which has to respond to events that happen in the market e.g. a change in the price of a stock. When this happens, there may be multiple subscribers on the main thread which should be invoked, which is a classical scenario to use events. p  pI guess I can always use the ProducerConsumer with some message queue, and have the consumer raise events on the main thread, but I figured there might be a more direct way.p

Negative 2097 pI have a textarea with a scrollbar.  I need to change the position of your cursor in the textarea with javascript AND strongscroll the textarea so your cursor is visible.strong  I am using elem.selectionStart and elem.selectionEnd to move your cursor, but when I move it to a point that is not visible, the textarea does not scroll so the cursor is visible.p  pMore details probably TLDR I am creating a slideshow editor and have a preview of the complete slideshow next to an editor textarea with scrollbar for the content.  As you move your cursor through the textarea, the slideshow changes slides so you are always viewing the slide that you are editing.  I need to get it so changing the slide using buttons moves your cursor so you can see the code that generated that slide.p  precode slideBoundries has numbers which are the indexes where the slides beginend  eg [0, 81, 140, 250] for slideshow with 3 slides  if doc.editor.selectionEnd gt slideBoundries[curSlide] ampamp     doc.editor.selectionEnd lt slideBoundries[curSlide  1]      return  doc.editor.selectionStart  slideBoundries[curSlide] doc.editor.selectionEnd  slideBoundries[curSlide] codepre  pI could just count the number of newlines in the file so I know how far to scroll down, but there are many lines that are long and take up multiple lines.

Then scroll the real textarea to the height of the phantom textarea.p

Negative 2097 pIn the past I wrote a program that dynamically loads DLLs in a way such that thirdparty users can make their own DLLs without having to modify the source of the application itself. The names were kept in an ini file.p  pThe problem I hated about my design was that since the DLLs were for performing mathematical calculations using unique number types, I had to maintain all the current values from within the code of the DLL itself. It made accessing, changing, and working with important application variables very difficult. I know that if I made the DLLs statically linked and included information about their classes into my project that I would not have this problem, but I really dont want to sacrifice the ability for users to acquire bundles of extra DLLs and just drop them into place. One thing Ive considered is allowing the DLL to dump the value out into a BYTE array for the application to store and pass around.p  pCould anyone share any insight on how I might be able to improve this designp

Negative 2097 pIve similar questions asked on this site, but this is a bit of a different scenario than what I have seen.p  pWe have a PC client execute JUnit 4 tests. However, we have a custom test runner that ships the JUnit 4 tests as JUnit 3 tests using JUnit38ClassRunner over ethernet to a target system that is running a service that executes JUnit tests using JUnit 3.8. The tests execute as intended, however, when they are returned to the PC client they are marked as Unrooted Tests. Is there a way to organize these tests as nonunrooted tests It is somewhat difficult to sift through the failed results when they are all returned in one group when not using Eclipse. Using JUnit 4 is not an option on the remote system as the target embedded system uses Java 1.4.2, and this is not changing anytime in the near future. We really do not want to have to downgrade to JUnit 3.8 on the PC client side because of the RunWith annotation, which will take us a little while to figure out how to reimplement.p  pAny assistance on this is appreciated, thanks in advance.p

If I change this to white with setBackgroundColor, the SurfaceView gets white, but the white background will be drawn OVER all my other images drawn with OpenGL. I think these must be switched.

Negative 2097 pYesterday I installed Delphi XE2 using the download option, so I guess the installed files came from Embarcadero up to date as 1st Nov.

Negative 2097 pIm working on an rtsp streamingAAC format client for iOS using ffmpeg. Right now I can only say my app is workable, but the streaming sound is very noisy and even a little distorted, far worse than when its played by vlc or mplayer. p  pThe stream is read by avreadframe, decoded by avcodecdecodeaudio3. Then I just send the decoded raw audio to Audio Queue.p  pWhen decoding a local aac file with my app, the sound seemed not so noisy at all. I know initial encoding would dramatically affect the result. However at least I should try to have it sounded like other streaming clients... p  pMany parts in my implementationmodification actually came from try and error.

Negative 2097 pI am currently scripting an AJAX image gallery of sorts, which preloads several large images at least 120kB per image up to 2MB before the lightbox is displayed. My question is whether to load these images sequentially e. g. have the preloader wait for one image to preload at a time or load the images parallel. My guess is, that multiple http connections parallel caching will be faster than a single http connection. However, I have read somewhere, that with the older IE had performance issues with parallel image loading. Is that still the casep  pI am coding the entire project in XHTML5 HTML5 XML and will target only current stable releases of the most common browsers Safari 5, Chrome 15, Firefox 8, IE9. AJAXing is done with the jQuery framework.p  pI am aware, that there are underlying network issues, which can greatly impact the loading of data combinations of latency, bandwidth, connection quality in terms of packet loss, max allowed concurrent connections by isp, proxies, servers, etc.. Lets just assume that the average user will use a somewhat decent connection dsl, cable, fiber with a latency below 80 ms and a bandwidth greater than 6 Mbps.p

Negative 2097 pive been doing some research on interfaces and a simple laymans explanation for what it truly is. when searching through seas of books For some reason people love using overly complex explanations and jargon to explain truly simple concepts guess it makes them feel big and i have a gut feeling its the same in this case.p  pso from what i could grasp, it seems like interfaces are nothing more than a way to reserve method names, their return type if any, and the type and amount of arguments they accept. so when a class implements an interface or interfaces it is forced to define the body of each method from the interfaces. Am i on the nose with this one or do i need to keep digging   p  pp.s. i know javascript doesnt have support for interfaces, but i still need to understand the concept because there are quite a few places where its shown how to emulate to an extent.p

Negative 2097 pJust to expand on my previous issue  I have two tables in my database and Ill like to extract certain information.  Tables belowp  precode   player playerid primary, playerName     match matchid primary, playerID1, playerID2, playerID3, scorer etc.. codepre  pYou provided me with the following code to obtain the names of the playersp  precodeSELECT p.Name  FROM match m INNER JOIN player p      ON p.playerid IN m.playerID1, m.playerID2, m.playerID3 etc codepre  pWorks beauitfully thanks  theres just two adjustments Id like to makep  p1 Id like to return the name of the scorer as well as the player names.  Since m.scorer is an ID, how do I map it to the p.Name atribute if p.Name is already being mapped to m.playerID 2 The above query returns the names of all the players.  I will soon be adding a search feature where you search for all matches for a certain player.  Is there anyway of excluding that player from the results seeing as we already know this player was in the match as he was searched for.  So pretty much return all matches, and fellow players for a certain player, but exclude the actual searched player from the results. Sorry if this is unclear, let me know and Ill expand on it.p  pThanks once again for the great helpp

Negative 2097 pThis is more of an approach question, I havent gotten to the code yet. But am new to SQL and php and would like to tackle this issue intelligently.p  pThe scenario is as followsp  pI have a table called Donations, each of which has exactly one string value in the column called AREA. AREA may have any one of nine predetermined values Northeast, Northwest, Downtown, etc....p  pI also have a table of Volunteers, each of which has specified which regions they are willing to travel to, to help pickup the donations. For each volunteer, I have 9 columns, each with a 1 or 0, corresponding to the nine areas listed above NW, NE, DT, etc... p  pI would like to run a query, series of queries or phpsql combination where by I can search for all active donations, attain which AREAs they are in, then query the Volunteers table, and get back a list of email address for only those Volunteers willing to travel to one or more of those areas.p  pAny help is appreciated. As an aside, there is no key value shared between these two tables.p

Negative 2097 pThank you in advanced for taking the time to read my post. I will be the first to admit that this piece of code is slightly convoluted.p  pThis weekend my project has been making a program that takes a formatted string as an argument and spits out all the possible permutations of that string. The formatted string looks similar to the printf formatted string. Constants are kept in the string, and the variable parts look like this [numberofchars][typeofpermuation] wherep  p[typeofpermutation] can be d for integers, u for uppercase alpha characters, l for lowercase, a for all alpha characters, and n for alpha numeric.p  pThere is a special case w which reads words from a word list instead of incrementing each individual character.p  pThings generally work the way I want them to. However, upon testing and debugging with gdb I have discovered two bugs that I cannot explain. p  pBug 1 The string partial is initially filled with the minimum characters of that type eg. 5d would be filled with 00000 However, after an arbitrary command is executed fopen the partial contains arbitrary characters, usually lower in value than 0x09. This occurs at line 143, which I have marked in the source.p  pBug 2 When I run the program like so .Permute w2d w words, where words is the Ubuntu word list, the program throws a segmentation fault after reaching around the 4,200th line of the word list. This is also perplexing. Because the number 4,200 is so random, I can only assume that the program is running out of stack memory or something like that.p  pI have this code broken up into several header files. I will post the main code first, and then the included header files underneath.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ..Librariespermute.h include ltmalloc.hgt include ltstring.hgt   void main int argc, char  argv[]     Allocate ten base pointers to be inserted into our master string.   struct base  part[10]    Allocate a character string on the heap to be manipulated by our program.   char  master  malloc100    Organize arguments   ifargc lt 2        printfUsagen.Permute [Format String] p w [wordlist] o [outputfile]n       printfFormat string with the general form [numberofchars][type]n       printfWhere [numberofchars] is between 1 and 9n       printfAnd [type] is d for integer, a for ALPHA, n for ALPHANUMERIC, u for UPPERCASE, l for LOWERCASEn       printfp increments all parts in parallel. n           printfw Reads words for w from [wordlist]n       return         int count     int parallel  0     char  wordlist  NULL     FILE  file  NULL     char  output  NULL     FILE  out  NULL     forcount  1 count lt argc count       char first  argv[count]       int second  argv[count]  1         if first            switch second              case p                 parallel  1                 break             case w                 wordlist  argv[count1]                 break             case o                 output  argv[count1]                 break                   Parse format string   int i  0 This is the counter for the current base struct were operating on. int x int size int type Create a pointer that points to a position inside our master string. char  current  master Cycle through each character in the format string. forcount  0 count lt strlenargv[1] count       If the character is a constant, set the current character in the master string to the character in the format string.      if argv[1]  count            current  argv[1]  count         current           Otherwise, initialize a base structure using one of the pointers in the array declared above.

I have a large div which is a droppable area. Inside this droppable area are multiple other droppable areas.p  pThe inner droppable area should walk trough its code when the element is dropped. Instead the code from the outer div seems to run. Am i doing something wrong The area around the divs should stay this way because elements can be placed here not officially dropped.p  pI hope my question is clear enough, but I think the fiddler speaks for itself.p  pP.S.  resizing in this example isnt functioning but is functioning in my development environment.p  hr  pRusty and Mark, Thank you for your replies.p  pIm sorry for the confusing resizer.

Negative 2097 pIm sure this is an easy fix but I cant seem to find it. I just have a form, that will be a subform of another, that needs to display the results of a query.p  pThe query is simple enough, just displays all fields of records that fall between specified dates. The query works great, but when I attach it to the form as its record source it doesnt display the data. I can see the correct amount of record selectors so I know its understanding the query but its as if all fields are hidden  p  pI have also tried building a query to the forms record source that was simply  Select query. From query. Oddly I have had this working before but I had to specify every field. What I mean is  p  pSelect title From querybr Select type From querybr Select date From query ...  p  pAnd so on for all the fields but this seems foolish, can anyone think of what I may be doing wrongbr Thanks in advancep  pstrongEdit, forgot to mention I also tried the foolish solution that I mentioned above and it didnt work so its definitely some issue that Im not seeing, some property thats probably not appropriately setstrong    p  psshekhar well its not really code at the moment Im using Access 2010. I have a form that needs to display a subform that executes this query of displaying records that have a data field that fall between dates specified by  the user. The query works and displays the correct records, but the form that it is attached to only shows the record selectors and all the fields appear to be hidden. I thought it may be one of the forms properties set incorrectly but I checked on the test form from another database that I used and each have what appears to be identical settings. So Im at a lossp

Negative 2097 pI am creating a simple website in Java EE, I am not using beans since I want to keep it simple.p  pThe structure of website is like I have different Jsp pages and every jsp page has a corresponding servlet which then connects the jsp page to database to store and retrieve data.p  pThe problem is that I have this one page index1 in which I select some option from drop down. My next jsp page which is index2.jsp should load data from the database in its fields according to the option selected from index1.jsp. p  pindex2 has a next and previous button. I am storing the value of option selected from index1 to show on every jsp page just for now. However when I click next on this index2.jsp it takes me to index3 with the same option value but when I press previous button on index3 it takes me to the servlet of index2 which is Servlet2 in this case with the value of option being shown as NULL. It is destroying the value from the session when I press previous button. and after that all other pages show the value of option as null as well. p  pAnother question is why the address of the servlet instead of indexa when loading data into indexa from the db using servlet.p

Negative 2097 pThis is going to be a difficult question to get answered which is why for 3 days that I have worked on this package my first package ever I have been hesitant to ask.p  pBelow is the layout for the spec and body of my package. Before you look at that here is what I am trying to accomplish. I AM CLOSE TO FINISHING so there is no need to fear that this question is not worth your time.p  pYou may see a few of my personal notes to self in the code as well.p  pMy code is incomplete and currently isnt compiling but before it ceased to compile I can tell you it did not work either. The DROP and CREATE procedures work. NO NEED TO TOUCH THOSE. My main issues are the LOGPROC, my EXCEPTIONS, my ARCHIVEALLTABLES... as far as I knowp  pHere is what I am trying to dop  pCreate a package that could be used to archive the newly created tables into archive tables in the format TESTTABLEA13AUG2012. This package will use a view I created called VWTESTTABLES which has this datap  precodeTESTTABLEA TESTTABLEB TESTTABLEC TESTTABLED codepre  pThis package will need to drop all previously archived tables before it creates new ones. As such, my package will need to have both DROPARCHIVETABLES and CREATEARCHIVETABLES procedures within it. In addition to the DROP and CREATE procedures, my package has a main procedure, called ARCHIVEALLTABLES. This is the procedure that would need to be called for instance by the scheduler and do the actual archiving. I need to incorporate proper exception handling in these procedures. e.g. dont care if the table does not exist when I go to drop it.p  pFinally, in order to properly track each archival run, I want to build a logging mechanism. To accomplish this, I built a table in my schema called TESTPACKAGELOGTBL. This table should has the following columns ARCHIVEDATE DATE, TABLENAME VARCHAR230, STATUSCODEVARCHAR21, COMMENTS VARCHAR24000. For each table I archive, I want to log the date, the table name, either S for success or E for error and, if I encounter an error in the drop or creation of the table, what the SQLERRM was should be displayed.p  pFinally, my ARCHIVEALLTABLES procedure should check this log table when it is finishing in order to determine if any tables were not archived properly. I created a function ERRORSFOUND return boolean that accepts one IN parameter todays date and checks the log table for errors. If this function returns true, my ARCHIVEALLTABLES procedure should account for this and notify an administrator For now I am leaving this untouched but eventually it will simply account for this with a comment stating that I would notify an admin and place NULL in the if then end block.p  pTo summarize, my package structure must contain at minimum the following proceduresp  pARCHIVEALLTABLES,  DROPARCHIVETABLE,  CREATEARCHIVETABLE,  ERRORSFOUND functionp  precodepackage specification CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE PKGTESTTABLES IS             Author               Created  8142012 84018 AM            Purpose  For storing procedures to drop, create, and archive new tables             Package specification           PROCEDURE ARCHIVEALLTABLES           PROCEDURE DROPARCHIVETABLES 2nd           PROCEDURE CREATEARCHIVETABLES 1st and call both from archive tables first assuming it works           PROCEDURE LOGPROC                                    PPROCESSSTARTTIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP                        ,PARCHIVEDATE DATE                        ,PTABLENAME VARCHAR2                        ,PSTATUSCODE VARCHAR2                        ,PCOMMENTS VARCHAR2                      PROCEDURE WSTR VARCHAR2            FUNCTION ERRORSFOUNDPJOBRUNTIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP RETURN BOOLEAN  END PKGTESTTABLES   package body CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY PKGTESTTABLES IS            Package body                                    Procedure W is a wrapper for DBMS output.

A given application identified in requests using an API key can make up to 120 REST calls a minute.  The service response includes an estimate of the total number of calls made in the last minute repeated abuse of the API exceeding the limit may cause the API key to be revoked.p  pWhen used from a single machine a web server providing a service to clients it is easy to control access  the server has full knowledge of the history of requests and can regulate itself correctly.p  pBut I am working on a program where distributed, independent clients make requests in parallel.p  pIn such a case it is much less clear what an optimal solution would be.

A more likely problem is that there are times when a smaller number of clients want to make many requests as quickly as possible for example, a client may need, exceptionally, to make several thousand requests when starting for the first time  it is possible two clients would start at around the same time, so they must cooperate to share the available bandwidth.p  pGiven all the above, strongwhat are suitable algorithms for the clients so that they ratelimit appropriatelystrong  Note that limited cooperation emisem possible because the API returns the total number of requests in the last minute for emallem clients.p  h2Current Solutionh2  pMy current solution when the question was written  a better approach is given as an answer is quite simple.  Each client has a record of the time the last call was made and the number of calls made in the last minute, as reported by the API, on that call.p  pIf the number of calls is less than 60 half the limit the client does not throttle.  This allows for fast bursts of small numbers of requests.p  pOtherwise ie when there are more previous requests the client calculates the limiting rate it would need to work at ie codeperiod  60  120  number of previous requestscode and then waits until the gap between the previous call and the current time exceeds that period in seconds 60 seconds in a minute 120 max requests per minute.  This effectively throttles the rate so that, if it were acting alone, it would not exceed the limit.p  pBut the above has problems.  If you think it through carefully youll see that for large numbers of requests a single client oscillates and does not reach maximum throughput this is partly because of the initial burst which will suddenly fall outside the window and partly because the algorithm does not make full use of its history.  And multiple clients will cooperate to an extent, but I doubt that it is optimal.p  h2Better Solutionsh2  pI can imagine a better solution that uses the full local history of the client and models other clients with, say, a Hidden Markov Model.  So each client would use the API report to model the other unknown clients and adjust its rate accordingly.p  pI can also imagine an algorithm for a single client that progressively transitions from unlimited behaviour for small bursts to optimal, limited behaviour for many requests without introducing oscillations.p  pstrongDo such approaches exist  Can anyone provide an implementation or reference  Can anyone think of better heuristicsstrongp  pI imagine this is a known problem somewhere.  In what field  Queuing theoryp  pI also guess see comments earlier that there is no optimal solution and that there may be some lore  tradition  accepted heuristic that works well in practice.  I would love to know what...  At the moment I am struggling to identify a similar problem in known network protocols I imagine Perlman would have some beautiful solution if so.p  pI am also interested to a lesser degree, for future reference if the program becomes popular in a solution that requires a central server to aid collaboration.p  h2Disclaimerh2  pThis question is not intended to be criticism of Echo Nest at all their service and conditions of use are great.  But the more I think about how best to use this, the more complexinteresting it becomes...p  pAlso, each client has a local cache used to avoid repeating calls.p  h2Updatesh2  pa hrefhttpwww.cs.ucla.educlassescs217SIG07Award.pdfPossibly relevant papera.p

Negative 2097 pOften times when writing code, I find myself using a value from a particular function call multiple times. I realized that an obvious optimization would be to capture these repeatedly used values in variables. This pseudo code p  precodefunction add1foo foo  1  ... dosomethingfoo1 dosomethingelsefoo1 codepre  pBecomesp  precodefunction add1foo foo  1  ... bar  foo1 dosomethingbar dosomethingelsebar codepre  pHowever, doing this explicitly makes code less readable in my experience. I assumed that compilers could not do this kind of optimization if our language of choice allows functions to have sideeffects. p  pRecently I looked into this, and if I understand correctly, this optimization iscan be done for languages where functions must be pure. That does not surprise me, but supposedly this can also be done for impure functions. With a few quick Google searches I found these snippets a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orggcc4.7changes.htmlGCC 4.7 Fortran improvementap  blockquote   pWhen performing frontendoptimization, the faggressivefunctionelimination option allows the removal of duplicate function calls even for impure functions.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCompileroptimizationCompiler Optimization Wikipediaap  blockquote   pFor example, in some languages functions are not permitted to have side effects. Therefore, if a program makes several calls to the same function with the same arguments, the compiler can immediately infer that the functions result need be computed only once. In languages where functions are allowed to have side effects, another strategy is possible. The optimizer can determine which function has no side effects, and restrict such optimizations to side effect free functions. This optimization is only possible when the optimizer has access to the called function.p blockquote  pFrom my understanding, this means that an optimizer can determine when a function is or is not pure, and perform this optimization when the function is. I say this because if a function always produces the same output when given the same input, and is side effect free, it would fulfill both conditions to be considered pure. p  pThese two snippets raise two questions for me.p  ol liHow can a compiler be able to safely make this optimization if a function is not pure as in faggressivefunctioneliminationli liHow can a compiler determine whether a function is pure or not as in the strategy suggested in the Wikipedia articleli ol  pand finally p  ul liCan this kind of optimization be applied to any language, or only when certain conditions are metli liIs this optimization a worthwhile one even for extremely simple functions li liHow much overhead does storing and retrieving a value from the stack incurli ul  pI apologize if these are stupid or illogical questions.

Negative 2097 pOne page website. Header at the top with anchor links To different divs sections on the page.p  pSay my screen resolution is 1280800 and each div section is max 800 and the content on each div section is visible when my browser is maximum size. I forgot to mention that scrolling is disabled so the other divs are only visible scrolled automatically using the anchor links at the top. So heres the problem, when I resize my browser, say for example theres only 450px worth of height on my browser, I can only see that amount of content on the screen and cannot scroll until the bottom of the div, so it hits the bottom of my browser.p  pAnother point to understand is that all the elements in the div itself are not overflowing the height of the div so a simple overflow does not work because the issue is to do with the size of the browsers height.p  pIn essence when the browser window is anything less than 800px, the div is then covered up at the bottom by the amount reduced by the browser. I want the whole div NOT THE CONTENT INSIDE IT to be pushed up top position as far as it needs to so that the bottom of the div i.e. 800th pixel touches the bottom of the browser. p  pAny solutionp

Negative 2097 pwe have Java project where we should deliver only artifacts that were changed but in the same time have product that contains latest released version of not changed components and changed components in this release. We do the builds using Maven 3.p  pLets see if we have product 1.1SNAPSHOT means its under development where 6 components have their own release versions.p  pNow if would have structure likep  precode c1  1.0SNAPSHOT    m1  2.0SNAPSHOT    m2  3.0SNAPSHOT  c2  4.0SNAPSHOT    m3  5.0SNAPSHOT    m4  6.0SNAPSHOT codepre  pwhere c is parent component and m is module. Versions are taken randomly. There could be some dependencies, like m4 depends on m2.p  pLets think we have updated m2 module and we want to release it. How we can do it Manually only start release process on the m2 and m4 modules What to tag question also arises I suppose it should be the whole product containing new revision used for tagging for just released modules and revision of the sources for not updated modules.p  pNext what we want is to create product release package which will be 1.1 version and which will include latest released version for m1 it can be 0.99 and m3 it can be 4.99 which can be take from release of 1.0 of the product since they were not changed. Also new just released versions for m2 it will be 3.0 and m4  it will be 6.0 should be part of 1.1 package. How it can be donep  pThe only solution I see is to use mavenversionplugin but it requires several hack development in the process.p  pThe idea is to have minimum builds and have just released modules that were changed.p  pWhat maven can offer to have this automatically Mavenreleaseplugin is not helpful at this level. How to do the release of just changed components I started thinking perhaps we dont need to use SNAPSHOT in order to support this ideology.p  pThank you.p

Basically the value would be shown for the first row in the dataset and blanked for each subsequent row that had the same value.p  pI read about using break but I am not sure how to write it up or if it can be used. I read other threads addressing the same issue but was not able to come up with a solution for my scenario. p  pShould I just retrieve the dataset and suppress them in C code  If so I need helppointers to do that.p

Negative 2097 pI am interested in generating entropy from mouse movements and keystrokes in .NET for the purposes of encryption this could be either in a Forms application where the mouse movement and keystroke data is received via events in the application itself or in a web application where the mouse movement and keystroke data is recorded using JavaScript and sent to the server via Ajax.p  pThis technique is being currently employed on the new MEGA site.p  pI have done a little research myself and came across what looks like a good example in C however it is a little outside my CC

Negative 2097 pIm referencing a book by bennet, s et al 2002. Objectorientated systems analysis and design 2nd ed. McgraawHillMaidenhead.p  pIn the book when describing requirements analysis Bennet refers to three types of analysis class stereotypes as a way of breaking down use case diagrams into defined classes.p  pThe first two seem fairly straight forward  an boundary class is the terminus between the user and the system, or the system and other systems that it relies on. An entity class is the information and associated behaviour of some phenomenon or concepts such as an individual, a real life object, or a real life event i.e. the data that youre trying to model or store, such as a person.p  pFinally, there are control classes which represent coordination sequencing, transactions and control of other objects. This definition isnt as clear as Bennet states p  blockquote   pmeanwhile, the boundary class represents interaction with the user and the entity clases    represent the behaviour of things in the application domain and storage of information that    is directly associated with these thingsp blockquote  pThis rather begs the question what exactly is an application or software domain in this context How does the control class fit in with these other two definitionsp

Negative 2097 pI have a MVC3 project that uses strongproperty injectionstrong.  Within my controllers I make a call to a service class.

Negative 2097 pI have a table called Table A that has an strongalivestrong column. This column can be 1 or 0. If it is 0 then it means that it has been deleted. This is a soft delete.p  pThe problem I have is that I want to verify foreign key constraints on rows in this table. If I was to delete a row from Table A then more often than not it would through foreign key constraints because of its relationship with other rows. This is good and expected. The problem I have is that as my deletions are soft just updating a flag I do not get any constraint checking when I delete. This means that I need to check the relationships manually.p  pIs there anyway I can add a constraint to an oracle table which uses the 1 and 0 as part of the integrity constraint For example if I update strongalivestrong column to 0 it will then hit the constraint and so will not allow the column to be changed to 0.p  pCan I do this somehowp  pHope this makes sense.p  pThanksp

Negative 2097 pI have some functions which take very specific matrices with specific information loaded in using another function Ive made. Currently the matrices the function accepts are the normal R matrix type. However Id like to assign them as a different type or class so as to achieve easy input checking so the user cant throw any matrix into the function.p  pI figured the S3 method would be easy after seeing a few examples on the netp  precodemat1 lt matrixc110,ncol5  colnamesmat1 lt cONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR,FIVE  as.sdpmgdna lt functionx    classx lt sdpmgdna   returnx   mat2 lt as.sdpmgdnamat1 codepre  pThis appears to work in so far as if I return mat2 I see a matrix, and if I call it via indecies mat2[1,2] I get the right values I should get. However I cant be sure some things have changed  it is now described as sdpmgdna[10] i.e. it seems to ignore it has 2 dimensions, although doing the above and printing mat2 to screen shows it clearly does have 2 dimensions. Another odd thing is if I do codecolnamesmat2code they are returned. However if I try to find the colname of an individual column e.g. codecolnamemat2[,4]code then the value returned is codeNULLcode. Can anyone explain why this is or what I should do  I really want it to basically be a matrix, but because the functions require it to be very specific in terms of a matrix of what and how big, defining it as another class would make error and input checking so much easier  and allow me to use the methods mechanism of R so all my custom plotting functions could just be methods of plot.p
Negative 2097 pIf I have a MySQL table that is not changed very often once a month which contains information such as active user accounts for a web service.

This would allow me to avoid one SQL call to the database layer which is stressed at the moment on every request. My question is how safe is it to store data like this in productionp  pBy the way, I would refresh the account list whenever a new user account is added via an API call. As stated above, this would happen about once to twice a month.p

Negative 2097 pI hope Ill be clear enough. p  pIn my app, I have set it so that pressing the back button activates googles voice recognition service. In the codeonActivityResultcode, it checks whether the first word is call or text and proceed accordingly with the rest of the spoken sentence. For text specifically, it goes like text [contact name] message [message content] and then sends it using an codesmsManagercode. But since it might get the name or the message wrong, I want it to read out the message and the persons name first for confirmation which I did just fine. p  pThe problem is, to confirm or cancel, I want to also use voice recognition. If after the message is read out, the user says something like send and only then it should proceed to send the message.

Negative 2097 pI have a long running function. Which iterates through a large array and performs a function within each loop. p  precodelongFunction  function        var self  this        var data  self.data         forvar i0 len  data.length iltlen i               self.smallFunctioni         , smallFunction  functionindex   Do Stuff   codepre  pFor the most part this is fine but when I am dealing with arrays above around 1500 or so we get to the point of recieving a javascript execution alert message.p  pSo I need to break this up.  My first attempt is like sop  precodelongFunction  functionindex        var self  this        var data  self.data         self.smallFunctionindex        ifdata.slides[index1          setTimeoutfunction             self.longFunctionindex1          ,0              else                 WORK FINISHED         , smallFunction  functionindex   Do Stuff   codepre  pSo here I am removing the loop and introducing a self calling function which increases its index each iteration.  To return control to the main UI thread in order to prevent the javascript execution warning method I have added a codesetTimeoutcode to allow it time to update after each iteration.  The problem is that with this method getting the actual work done takes quite literally 10 times longer.  What appears to be happening is although the codesetTimeoutcode is set to 0, it is actually waiting more like 10ms.  which on large arrays builds up very quickly.  Removing the codesetTimeoutcode and letting codelongFunctioncode call itself gives performance comparable to the original loop method.p  pI need another solution, one which has comparable performance to the loop but which does not cause a javascript execution warning.  Unfortunately webWorkers cannot be used in this instance. p  pIt is important to note that I do not need a fully responsive UI during this process.  Just enough to update a progress bar every few seconds.p  pWould breaking it up into chunks of loops be an option  I.e. perform 500 iterations at a time, stop, timeout, update progress bar, perform next 500 etc.. etc..p  pIs there anything betterp  pstrongANSWERstrong p  pThe only solution seems to be chunking the work.p  pBy adding the following to my self calling function I am allowing the UI to update every 250 iterationsp  precode longFunction  functionindex            var self  this            var data  self.data             self.smallFunctionindex            var nextindex  i1            ifdata.slides[nextindex             ifnextindex  250  0              setTimeoutfunction                                self.longFunctionnextindex              ,0                          else                  self.longFunctionnextindex                                   else                     WORK FINISHED                 ,     smallFunction  functionindex       Do Stuff       codepre  pAll I am doing here is checking if the next index is divisble by 250, if it is then we use a timeout to allow the main UI thread to update.  If not we call it again directly.  Problem solvedp

Negative 2097 pEverybody tells me that polling server for new data is stupid if the server is yours and you should implement push with GCM instead. Well, I agree and have done so but, I was wondering, how often can or should you perform pushp  pI have a simple app where people post stuff to the server and have a feed of everyone elses posts. The method on the server that does the saving to the database also triggers the GCM Push at the end, so Google sends out the push notifications to everybody and everybody then requeries the server for new posts, containing the post weve just made.p  pemBut, what if I have, lets say milion users and a new post is created lets say every minute.em This will mean that app will connect to server every minutes and will kill the battery. So my question is, how often you perform Push Wouldnt in this case polling every 10 minutes be actually better for battery, rightp  pI know this example is kind of crazy, having milion people in your feed, but its just to make a point, because I cant imagine how this would scale. I figure Google will handle sending million gcm messages at once no problem.p  pstrongSo the question is, is there a limit after which Push is contraproductivestrong I guess its kind of a first world problem D but cant imagine Facebook handles stuff like this.p  pThanksp

But I want to use OpenGL for visual output so I created an OpenGL View which Im initializing by using the intrinsic parameters which I got from using an OpenCV cam calibration program for the GLPROJECTION matrix as followsp  precodecvMat intrMat  tracker.camMatrix  intrinsic 3x3 matrix  contains  641.68  0.00    319.50     0.00    641.68  212.50     0.00    0.00    1.00  const float fx  intrMat.atltdoublegt0,0 const float fy  intrMat.atltdoublegt1,1 const float fovy  2  atan0.5f  screenH  fy  RAD2DEG const float aspect  screenWfy  screenHfx  GL Perspective values fx641.68  fy641.68  fovy41.01  aspect1.33  gluPerspectivefovy, aspect, 0.1, 100.0 codepre  pThis is how Ive seen it in similar projects and I emthinkem until here everythings correct. When a marker is detected, the extrinsic parameters are calculated in the ARma library using  codecvFindExtrinsicCameraParams2code which is the same as codecvsolvePnPcode. So I get the rotation vector coderotVeccode and the translation vector codetVeccode and throw them into the following method to calculate the GLMODELVIEW matrixp  precodevoidcalcModelviewMatGLfloat mvMat fromRotVeccvMat const amprotVec transVeccvMat const amptVec      cvMat rotMat     cvMat rotVecGL  rotVec.clone      rotVecGL.atltfloatgt1  rotVecGL.atltfloatgt1     rotVecGL.atltfloatgt2  rotVecGL.atltfloatgt2      cvRodriguesrotVecGL, rotMat       init array with zeros     memsetvoid mvMat, 0, 16  sizeoffloat       set the rotation     for int i  0 i lt 3 i          for int j  0 j lt 3 j              mvMat[i  4  j]  rotMat.atltfloatgti, j                     set the translation     for int i  0 i lt 3 i          float s  i gt 0  1  1         mvMat[12  i]  s  tVec.atltfloatgti           mvMat[15]  1  codepre  pThis is the way of transforming these two vectors into a GLMODELVIEW matrix that Ive found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3712049howtouseanopencvrotationandtranslationvectorwithopenglesinandroidherea. I embelieveem that this is correct but the problem is that the components in the translation vector which I get are much too large between 500 and 1500 to get displayed. Here is an example output of the matrixp  precode0.96    0.05    0.26   0.00     0.01    0.97    0.23    0.00     0.27    0.22   0.94    0.00     72.55  8.47    479.63 1.00 codepre  pWhy is that so What kind of units does solvePnP use in the translation vector and how can I transform them into usable values for displaying in my OpenGL Viewp

Negative 2097 pI am working on this project here for school and I really am stuck at this point. Basically I have to take a text file. Then I have to fill an arraylists with the information inside it. After that I need to format it correctly so that I can use it for Category, question, and answer. I have no idea how to do that, so below is what the instructor asks us if that helps clear it up any further.  p  blockquote   pIn this assignment you will write an application that simulates a   trivia game.

Your program will   select a random question from each category to be answered by the   player. The score will be displayed at the end of each run.p      pInput data format The input file contains questions and answers in   different categories. For each category, the first line indicates the   name of the category. This line will be followed by a number of pairs   of lines. The first line of the pair is the question, and the second   line is its corresponding answer. A blank line separates the   categories. Technical requirementsp      p Create a class called TriviaQuestion that represents a typical question object.p      p After reading the data, store the information inside ArrayLists.p      p Be user friendly in your inputoutput.

Negative 2097 pI have an app where multiple emergency messages can be received. When each message is received it needs to open a dialog with the emergency details. If more than one emergency is received it will stack the dialogs so that when the most recent emergency message is dealt with and that particular dialog closes, the previous most recent and unhandled emergency should appear, as if they are stacked.p  pAlso, the details for each emergency are updated every x seconds from a service and these changes need to make their way to the correct dialog instance so that, when on screen the dialog is up to date.p  pI had this working in, I think, an unefficient way. I was storing the instance of each dialog fragment object in a list and updating that instance with new details and then opening it. This meant that if 50 emergencies were spammed I was storing 50 dialogs. Not great for memory.p  pAlso, this method didnt work well with orientation, where the object is destroyed and rebuilt, it was taken out of my list and the details reverted to the original details which were stored in its intent.p  pI am looking for a way to do this that is as efficient as possible and I wanted to ask your collective Android brain for suggestions.p  pHow would I efficiently manage multiple instances of the same dialog class to get the behaviour I requirep

Negative 2097 pI have a Cell Table that I am using to output some search results. The cell table uses a list data provider to update info. I want to separate different sections so I am attempting to add a custom row in between different sections that has one cell that spans all of the columns. I am extending AbstractCellTableBuilder to do this, but my issue comes when I use TableRowBuilder and startRow, calling startRow returns a null pointer exception, to AbstractCellTableBuilder.java243, which refers to tbody. So this is leading me to believe that my cell table is not getting passed into AbstractCellTableBuilder properly.

Negative 2097 pI have a hrefhttpt.co2dhqeVDz4jtweeted an imagea illustrating the problem with Flex ColumnSeries on a PlotChart when trying to overlay one on top of another.p  pEssentially, it can display one series alright, two or more OK on initialization, but after a bit of manipulation in the user session, the columns lose their sense of where zero is, and begin to float these series have no minfield, thus zero is their starting point. FWIW the axis for these columns is on the right, but that can change given the type of data displayed.p  pThe app this is for allows users to turn multiple series of multiple plotting styles on and off, change visual parameters, and even the order in which the series stack on top of each other  just to give you an idea of whats going on.p  pDue to how dynamic this all is, I am doing most of the code in ActionScript.p  pSo the questions arep  ol liIs this fixable Googling around has provided no insights, regardless of inquiry.li liIs there a refresh function or equivalent within PlotChartCartesianCharts that may helpli liMay this not be a problem with the chart canvas, but more of the axis which the series points to or the series itselfli ol  pIf it has not been made clear already I am lost on this. The issue I have known about for a year now was first discovered on a Beta version of the app I am working on now, but it took a while for it to surface in an average user session. As the complexity of the app has grown by client demand, the issue takes a lot less time to surface.p  pThe issue also occurs on all versions of Flex I have used 4.5, 4.6, 4.9... etc.p  pPlease help, or offer pointers. Thanksp

Negative 2097 pIve had a problem with editing Label in GUI so I decided to transform that label to textbox with BackColor as the background has to make it look exactly as label do, but after focusing on that textbox will blinking cursor appear. Its pretty unsightly amp the only way Ive found is to set the property Enabled to false, but I also require from that textbox to do something after doubleclick amp only one click. So if it isnt enabled control, it doesnt react to doubleclicking.p  pEssentially I want to behave that textbox as label by default until its clicked once, if it is doubleclicked, then will be performed some function only rewriting the text property of other textbox. So if it is clicked once, Id like to make the textbox look like real textbox for text insert with cursor blinking. After pushing Enter it would again transform to the fake label without cursor blinking after focus.p  pEhm, is that possible Dp  pThanksp  pP.S.

Negative 2097 pMy research is about find a shortest path between an origin and a destination predefined.

Datagridview should only display 10or 50 records per page, and bindingnavigator control should be used to switch between pages so that the UI remains responsive and it becomes more memoryefficient because eventually my database will have thousands of records.p  p2.

A variable number of consumer may be connected to this topic, from 0 to less than 10. There is only one publisher in the topic and always publish all of his data as a single message little data, just a couple of fields of a sensor reading. The publication rate of this information is variable, not necessarily time based, when something changes a new updated message is sent to the broker. The problem is that when a new consumer connects to the topic it has no data of the device readings until a new message is send to the topic by the device. This could be solve by creating an additional queue so new connections can subscribe to the topic and then request the device for the current reading through the queue the device would consume the queue message which would be a request for data, and then response in the same queue. But Since the messages send to the topic are always information complete I was wondering if is it possible to configure the topic to store a copy of just the last message and send this to new connections without know client identifiers or other infop  pCurrent broker in use is ActiveMQ.p

Negative 2097 pWasnt able to reproduce inhouse.  About 20 of our orders coming from the field via Google Wallet have the following format of the ORDER ID 9170416xxxxx5019212 instead of 12999763xxxxx4705758.139441xxxxx94837p  pWe store the Order IDs on the server, so we can match users to their purchases. Order IDs on Google Wallet webpage ALWAYS have the following format 12999763xxxxx4705758.139441xxxxx94837p  pHowever, what I see stored in our database is sometimes in this format 9170416xxxxx5019212p  pWe are able to match a few orders by timestamps. Its clear that some users ALWAYS have the order IDs in the old or just different format, but on the Google Wallet page their orders have new order IDs. So, there is no way for us, having the old format order ID on our server, to find the users order on Google Wallet or the other way around.p  pThis is a severe issue, because customer support cannot be provide to about 20 of the customers.p  pIs there a way to see both IDs or match them somehow It looks like a bug on Googles side. I thinking the return googleorgerid instead of merchantorderid or something like that. This could be customers using the old Google Checkout instead of Wallet. Im just guessingp  pThe point is the order ID return in the JSON returned by Googles API does not match the record they show to me on Google Wallet page for the same order.p

Negative 2097 pI have a table that will contain large amounts of data. The purpose of this table is user transactions.p  pI will be inserting into this table from a webservice, which a third party will be calling, frequently.p  pThe third party will be supplying a reference code most probably a string.p  pThe requirement here is that I will need to check whether this reference code has already been inserted. If it exists, just return the details and do nothing else. If it doesnt create the transaction as expected. The reasoning behind this is the possibility of loss of communication with the service after the request is received.p  pI have some performance concerns with this, as the search will be done on a string value, and also on a large table. Most of the time the transaction will not exist in the database, as this is just a precaution.p  pI am not asking for code here, but for the best approach for performance.p

Negative 2097 pI was able to achieve everything originaly set out to do in the post bellow, but I ran into a problem where multiclass items display multiple images. strongMy main question now is whether I took the right approach to solving my original goalsstrong or if there is a more clever way to active the same effect, in turn fixing the one problem I currently have. Here is the break down p  p1 To achieve the image change feature,  I used CSS to hide the multiple inline seasonal images in each sortable item. I then used a bit of JS to apply a class of .seen to all items sorted. Then relied on css again to display images inteneded. p  p2 One problem found is that If a sortable item has more than one seasonal class, two images are shown when either of those classes become active. I know I can HIDE the problem by setting a set width and height to .grid .sortableitem and controlling overflow commented out in my example to show problem  BUT, I dont want to just hide it. How can I properly display the seasonal image intended when that class becomes activep  pHere is a code pen with my code a hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpennrLwK relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpennrLwKap  pAs always, any help is greatly appreciated.p  hr  pThis is a general question on how to go about building a project I have in mind, and the best way to set off on the right foot. I am fairly new to JS, please be gentle. p  pI want to use isotope.js or a similar script to display a page with multiple items about 30 different plants found in a garden and the ability to sort them by seasons of the year  what is most beautiful now   and view all a total of 6 categories . p  pOn load, or when sorted by either what is beautiful now or view all, I need each item to reflect the image of the current season we are in.  p  pWhen sorted by season, I need those current images to switch over to a designated seasonal image of that plant. Therefore, each sortable item will ultimately have 4 different versions with 4 different images in the background ready to surface when plants are sorted. perhaps 5 if it makes more sense to have a current version besides the 4 seasonal versions.p  pMy question strongwhat approach can I take to achieve this effect in a manageable waystrong p  pCan isotope apply a class to items sorted Assuming it canp  ol liShould each item have 4 inline images, each with a css class, that I then control by using codedisplayinlinecode and codedisplaynonecode properties from my stylesheets I worry that this approach would significantly increase load times li liWould it make more sense to create a blank dummy div whos background I control similarly to the example above relying mostly on CSS. li liOr is there some other way involving JS I am overlookingli ol  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 2097 pGiven the scenario that you have valuable data being served from an API mysite.comapiOooOOooData, how can access to it be restricted to the iOS  Android app that it is intended for It is paramount that the data be associated with the proper advertising via the apps. If the API can be used apart from that, the data is being given out for free with no reward from advertising, or other developers could be using it and actually stealing the profits.p  pIf this were a webonly app, it would be no issue to restrict the usage to my own site. Because this is possible and important when dealing with the web, I am inclined to think that there is something in place to deal with this issue with other technologies. My project is using web technology with Cordova. Theres no user system, so authentication isnt an option.p  pThe only measure I know I could implement is to arbitrarily include a key in my code and send it with all ajax requests, then have the server require that key. Since the code is in a private repo, only users with jailbroken phones should be able to see that code. Thats an obviously weak solution and too much of a risk.p  pIs there a standard and secure approach to thisp

I thought it might interest some of you as to WHY I am going through the hassle of doing this programmatically rather than through the XML file.  The reason is that I am trying to recognize a large number of gestures rapidly.  I found with another test file that having a single GestureOverlayView was slow, you would recognize them one at a time.  However, side by side, they would be able to create predictions simultaneously, giving the illusion of faster.  With a bit of work, I am hoping to create additional GestureOverlayViews on touch, and destroy them once the command is complete.  But I couldnt even get through the obvious in this simple test, which is the creation of the view.p

Negative 2097 pI am using Yii2 for a project. I have a class for consuming a third party service. This class has two methods sendRequest and processResponse. I would like to maintain separate logs for payload in sendRequest before actually sending it and another log for the raw response data received in processResponse before doing any processing. Additionally I would like log rotation on both logs as the files may grow indefinitely and want both files to be separate from the default app.log. Is this possible How may I implement this using Yii2 APIsp
Negative 2097 pI have two columns in a table that are known as S and D, where S is a date, and D is a duration. E.g.p  precodeS Column January February March April  D Column 60 30 45 30 codepre  pOn a separate sheet, imagine that Row 1 contains a sequence of dates variable, depends on user menu selection.p  pRow 2 requires the following calculationp  precode[x  s1d1  xs2d2  ...  xsndn]  n codepre  p...where x is any date along Row 1.p  pThe calculation would only be done when multiple criteria are matched.p  pMy initial attempt involved creating a separate table, but I think this can be done in a onecell formula in Row 2. I dont think a sumindexmatch type would work here considering d1, d2, ..., dn are denominators with different values.p  pHere is an example attemptp  precodeSUMSelectedDateINDEXTable[StartDates],MATCHCriteria1ampCriteria2,Range1ampRange2,0INDEXTable[Durations],MATCHCriteria1ampCriteria2,Range1ampRange2,0 codepre  pIt may be important to note that I am able to do this in a twostep fashion. First,  I create a table that does the calculation on each row. Then, I reference the table. It would be nice if I can eliminate the need of a calculation table in favour of an arraytype formula.p

Negative 2097 pIs it ever good practice to implement a public method to call another public method in something like an API  I fear duplication issues when the user of the API overrides these methods.  I would recommend using a private method that can be called by both of the original public methods to do the actual implementation.p  pImagine a data structure like a List.  If I have an addAlllotsoItems call addsimgleItem for every item, this will cause problems when being overriden by the user. He could be doing some logic in his overriden add and in addAll.  This logic would then be duplicated because he didnt know I was going to call add when I did.p  pLooks like Java 8, at least implements ArrayList the way I described. Same with Androids ArrayAdapter, thankfully.p  pMy question is when is it ever okay to call a public method from another public method when designing an API or a class that may be extendedp  pEdit For a clear examplep  pLets say I am extending ArrayList because I want to bark at the user System.out.printlnBark every time something is added to the list.

Negative 2097 pJava designers felt that unsigned integers were unnecessary. Specifically, they felt that  the concept of unsigned was used mostly to specify the behavior of the highorder bit, which defines the sign of an integer value. Java manages the meaning of the highorder bit differently, by adding a special Unsigned Right Shift Operator . Thus, the need for an unsigned integer type was eliminated. Then, why Java 8 will have some support for unsigned integers.p

Negative 2097 pI want to make a game similar to galaga in xna using C.  I have two types of enemies behavior and sprite are different, as well as sound effects, and I want each to have their own rows.  I was earlier using arrays to generate enemies on screen, but apparently this isnt a good approach and was told I should use lists instead.  Now, I was thinking there could be a few of ways of creating the enemy classes themselves.  One was using inheritance, with a base class of Enemy, and then two other classes that inherit from Enemy but have their own behavior and sprite.  Another way of doing this would be to create an enemy interface.  And one other way of setting this up would be to use structs.  I think using interface would be more time consuming compared to the other two, but I could be wrong if I am, let me know.  The other two I am not sure about though.  Technically, I believe they both use classes, just one uses structs.  What would be the better way of doing this, inheriting from an enemy class, or using an enemy struct  p

Negative 2097 pMy web app has a master jade template that contains all the main components that need to be loaded on EVERY page of the app. One of these components is a navbar which Ive split out into another template. This navbar has a dropdown that needs to be populated dynamically from a DB.p  pThe problem Im having is that I want to populate the dropdown at the time that the navbar gets rendered. Because Im using express 4.0 with nodeJS, I thought of using a helper function that would populate the list straight from within the navbar template. Because this function is async though, the navbar renders itself before the dropdown items are retrieved from the DB.p  pI also thought of using AJAX on the page load to populate it or even just passing the dropdown items into the template beforehand but I dont want to have to pass in this list on every single res.render call in my controllers.p  pWhat is the best way to go about doing thisp  h2Sample templatesh2  pcodemaster.jadecodep  precodedoctype html htmllangen head     block title body     header         include navbar         block headerContent     content         block content codepre  pcodenavbar.jadecodep  precode... nav code  liclassdropdown   ahref, classdropdowntoggle, datatoggledropdown List     spanclasscaret       ulclassdropdownmenu, rolemenu         li           each val, index in list             ahref val codepre  pA typical page in the system would just extend the master template and fill in the appropriate header and content blocks.p  pThanksp  h2EDITh2  pAdding a sample controller to show render callp  pcodesampleController.jscodep  precode...some error checking model.savefunctionerr, results     if err       res.renderview, error some error    else       res.renderview, data formatted results obj codepre  pThe data specifically relates with the content that should be rendered on this particular view and not necessarily whats required by the master.

Negative 2097 pI have a Kendo Grid for records that have four status types scheduled, open, on execution and closed.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxPWQl.png altenter image description herep  pI am trying to use the checkboxes as filters so I can show only the statuses I need. I know how to set one single filter, for example, list only the scheduled records, or the closed ones. But I want to show the scheduled and open records, for example, and I havent figured out how.

In the end, apply all the filters.p  pBut what is happening it only applies one filter. For example, when I check the closed checkbox, it shows only closed records, ignoring the other checked checkboxes.p

Negative 2097 pIve been asked to look into an issue that another developer has experienced. When uploading a photo or photos on a mobile version of a website there seems to be a 3 to 5 second delay with the DOM where we hide the upload button and show a loading gif.p  pThe action is started when the change event fires on the file input like so, the following code is ran when the application is loadedp  precodeinit function      some variables here    fileUploadId.onchange, this.uploadPhotos    other stuff follows   codepre  pthe codethis.uploadPhotoscode function looks like sop  precodeuploadPhotos  functionevt      use strict     loaderAnimation.show  Div containing form items     photoUploadLoader.hide  Div showing loading gif     var files  evt.target.files  FileList object      nameSpace.components.ImagesUpload.filesCount files.length       Loop through the FileList and render image files as thumbnails.     for var i  0, f f  files[i] i          nameSpace.components.ImagesUpload.files.pushf         nameSpace.components.ImagesUpload.readImagef        codepre  pNow there is a delay, with the first two show and hide actions in the method above. At first I thought it may be due to the looping after, but when I reduce the method so only the show and hide actions are included, like sop  precodeuploadPhotos  function          loaderAnimation.show  Div containing form items         photoUploadLoader.hide  Div showing loading gif  codepre  pI even removed the jQuery methods and just used raw codedocument.getElementById.style.displaycode however I still get the delay. What could cause this delay. Its as if there is some parsing happening immediately when the codefileUploadId.onchange... code happens. The number of photos selected as the input allows multiple doesnt have a significant effect on the DOM update but it does on the actual upload. Any ideas why the DOM updaterepaint takes so long I am testing on a physical device iPhone 4 using Safari over Wifi. When I used Chrome Dev Tools or the iOS simulator we get no delayp

Some modules are semester long and some are a yearlong.   Each module has assessment components that have weights contributed to   the overall mark on the module. Assessments are of different types   like inclass test, coursework, final exam, etc. Students register on   courses starting from Foundation. Students might change the course   over time e.g. transfer from Business to Business Computing.   University would like to know about     students registration on   courses and  modules and tracking changes to them over time.    academic progress and performance of students  and faculty in   different courses and modules including assessment components   coursework, inclass test, final exam, etc..p blockquote  pIf possible, please attach schema as a screenshot or whatever.

Negative 2097 pIm trying to write a program that allows a user to move a shape with arrow keys and change its color with the enter key.  I wasnt taught anything about GUIs or eventbased programming, so this is my first experience with any of that.

Negative 2097 pA problem that frequently occurs in stochastic simulation is calculating which of several events occurs.  This is typically done by having a probability for each event.  Then generating a random number and then iterating through the possible events until finding where the sum of their probabilities exceeds the random number.p  pHere is code that does what I want, but Im after a better way to do it.p  precodeimport random  def getEventeventProbabilities,probability     S  0     for key in eventProbabilities.keys         S  eventProbabilities[key]         if Sgt probability   key is the event to happen.             break     return key  x  event1  0.1 , event2  0.2 , event3  0.2 , event4  0.4, event5  0.1 values sum to 1. p  random.random  random number between 0 and 1. event  getEventx,p print p, event codepre  pI feel like theres got to be a more compact way to define getEvent  likely using codetakewhilecode  but I cant find it.  p  pIm after maximum efficiency, because I think this is where my code is going to spend most of its time.p  pIs there a way to make this more efficient through itertools or otherwisep  pstrongEdit added below to comment on whether we care about the order of iteration.strongp  pYoull notice that the keys will be processed in some order.  That order is independent of the random number p.  Lets consider the case where it processes them in the order I listed them.  If codeplt0.1code then it will return codeevent1code  So with 10 chance its event1.  If code0.1ltplt0.3code itll return codeevent2code so 20 probability.  Now lets consider a different order.  Say it goes in reverse order.  In this case if code0.9ltpcode well get codeevent1code 10, while if code0.7ltplt0.9code we get codeevent2code again 20.  So the probabilities of each event are the same, regardless of the order.p  pI just want to select 1 event, and I want that event selected with the corresponding probability.p

Negative 2097 pI am very new to ThreeJS, and am trying to move the quality of my render onto the next level. I believe a lot of the poor quality is down to lighting, textures and shadows. Apologies that I can not narrow this down further however I have hit a little bit of a roadblock.p  pThe way this works, in theory, is that it extrudes an SVG path and then applies a texture dependant upon the current product.

Negative 2097 pI have seen some installation files huge ones, install.sh for Matlab or Mathematica, for example for Unixlike systems, they must have embedded quite a lot of binary data, such as icons, sound, graphics, etc, into the script.

Negative 2097 pIm a real beginner to Maven and Spring framework in eclipse so excuse me if this sounds trivial..p  pI have created a MVC web project in eclipse using the STS plugin on my windows computer, but my problem is that the location of the jar and configuration files that maven is set to by default is CUsersMyName.m2repositoryp  pThis is a problem for me because eventually Im going to make a WAR file out of my project and deploy it on a Linux machine, which does not have Maven installed on it.p  pMy question is, is it possible to take all the jar files in my Maven repository, and make a local repository on the project itself rather than on an absolute path on the machine sort of like a lib folder within the WEBINF in the project that will hold all the maven jars and that maven will direct itself to it, and thus making the transition to the Linux machine smoothp  pI understand there is this classpath variable named M2REPO, but doesnt seem to be editable or accept relative path rather than absolute.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2097 pThere is a situation completely unknown to me. My emgit hookem is a emnodeem script created with codegruntgithookscode, and it bumps an app version by spawning a emgruntem script with corresponding commands, which modify version values in codepackage.jsoncode, codeconfig.xmlcode, and codeconfiguration.jscode. p  pemTo let the scripts work on staged files only, the node script executes codegit stashcode first, if its important for the problemem. p  pThus, after grunt tasks complete, I have those three files different to indexed versions. Then, node script calls codechildprocess.exec.git add update   listofmodifiedfilescode. It works fine with codejsoncode, and codexmlcode files, but returns codebinsh line 1 srcwwwjsconfigurationconfiguration.js Permission deniedcode for the latest one.p  pThere is no codegitcode group nor user in Mac OS X. All commands are executed with my credentials. No editor programs are opened. This also happens when I run a hook script directly.p  pAt the same time when the hook script fails, I can run codegit add update  srcwwwjsconfigurationconfiguration.jscode in a console with no problem.p  pI wonder, is this a emgitem, or emnodeem, or OS issue Can somebody let me know plsp

Negative 2097 pIm performing some calculations on arbitrary precision integers using GNU Multiple Precision GMP library. Then I need the decimal digits of the result. But not all of them just, lets say, a hundred of most significant digits that is, the digits the number starts with or a selected range of digits from the middle of the number e.g. digits 100..200 from a 1000digit number.p  pIs there any way to do it in GMPbr I couldnt find any functions in the documentation to extract a range of decimal digits as a string. The conversion functions which convert codempztcode to character strings always convert the entire number. One can only specify the radix, but not the startingending digit.p  pIs there any better way to do it other than converting the entire number into a humongous string only to take a small piece of it and throw out the restp  pstrongEditstrong What I need is not to control the precision of my numbers or limit it to a particular fixed amount of digits, but selecting a subset of digits from the digit string of the number of arbitrary precision.br Heres an example of what I needp  pcode71316831  19821203202357042996...2076482743codep  pThe actual number has 1112852 digits, which I contracted into the code...code.br Now, I need only an arbitrarily chosen substring of this humongous string of digits. For example, the ten strongmost significantstrong digits code1982120320code in this case. Or the digits from 1112841th to 1112849th code21203202code in this case. Or just a single digit at the 1112841th position code2code in this case.p  pIf I were to first convert my GMP number to a string of decimal digits with codempzgetstrcode, I would have to allocate a tremendous amount of memory for these digits only to use a tiny fraction of them and throw out the rest. Not to mention that the original codempztcode number in binary representation already eats up quite a lot.p

Similar events are determined by start and end time.p  pmy current algorithm isp  precodepick the first item in the list  find any event in the list that has start time is within 1 hour with first event start time and duration is  1 hour with first item duration duration determines the end time.   Then cluster them together basically I want to cluster events that happen at the same time frame  If no other event found, move to the next available event the one that has not been clustered.  Keep doing this until no more events to be clustered. codepre  pIm not sure if my algorithm will work or its efficient. Im trying to do an algorithm that is better than O n2, so hierarchical clustering wont work. Kmeans might not work also since I dont know ahead of time how many clusters I will need.p  pThere could be some other clustering algorithms that might fit better in my case.

Negative 2097 pstrongEdit 36  Sorry, this was a false alarm.  It seems to be working now.  I believe the codegcode flag on gfortran and codedebugcapicode are sufficient after all to generate line numbers for GDB gnu debugger.  I will make a short answer summarizing how to do this in case it is helpful for others was a bit of a learning experience for me.  But please feel free to post additional answers that improve on this.  In particular I would be interested in being able to get line numbers without using GDB, if thats possible.strongp  pThis must be a common problem but I cant find any answers. The error is in in the Fortran library what I call codef2.f90code below, but its a runtime error that isnt triggered until I am using the code via Python.p  pTo make it a little more explicitp  ol lipI compile several files with codegfortrancodep  precodegfortran c f1.f90 f2.f90 codepreli lipI generate a module with codef2pycodep  precodef2py c f1.o f2.o m main main.f90 codepreli lipIn pythonp  precodeimport main codepreli lipIn python, call subroutine main, inside of mainp  precodemain.main codepreli ol  pI can get this to work successfully but when I play around with codef2.f90code I will often have some error, and when that happens its in step 4 and will crash python and only give me the option to close it.  Unfortunately I get no information about what line in codef2.f90code caused the problem or any other info.p  pSo, pretty simple question, is there a way I can cause step 4 to give me some basic info about the run time crash  Mainly the line number of the problem.p  pIve tried adding codeg fbacktracecode to gfortran call and codedebugcapicode to codef2pycode and then using codegdb pythoncode with backtrace.  This looks somewhat promising as it at least tells me that the offending file is codef2.f90code, but not the line number.  If I try backtrace full it will tell me codeNo symbol table info availablecode which is probably where the line number info is heldp

Negative 2097 pIm coding up a searchkey algorithm for a binary search tree and am having issues. Im traversing the binary search tree and comparing the nodes using an inorder traversal algorithm using the basic recursion technique. However, when the conditional hits searchkey  node[x]value and I return the node, it seems as if it still continues executing code even after I return the node and it affects the final output. Does the recursion stack continue even if it hits a return value Is there a way to fix thisp

Negative 2097 pI have two databases, you can think about them as two shards, in one side I have rows with even primary key, in the other one I have rows with odd primary key.p  pI solved the problem of chosing the db for writing by overwriting the save method of my model so that I prefill the id value and successively with a database router the correct db for writing is selected, depending on the value of the primary id.p  pNow I have the problem of retrieving the information. Using the database router on its own is not enough, because if I do something like codeMymodel.objects.all code I dont get any primary key and I cannot select the database and in fact I should tell the ORM to fetch all the data from every database, but the database router can only return one databse for read and not a set.p  pTherefore I am thinking about using a custom manager to sum all the queryset from each different db together.p  pI have two questionsp  ol liCan a custom manager and a database router work togetherli liWhich one has precedence I mean, what is invoked after I do codeMymodel.objects.all code  I guess the custom manager is invoked, and only successively the database router is invoked. As far as I know, querysets are lazy, so I think the manager should be invoked later, but I am not able to find anything in the documentation.li ol  pOtherwise, do you know any other strategy to merge data from tables with the same structure in different databases without changing the interface exposed by the ORM to the python functionsp

Negative 2097 pI am currently working on a software project in C which has to run on a variety of platforms. I try to remain as close to the C90 standard as possible, but need some commonly supported extensions like stdint.h and an unsigned long long type. I deliberately do not want to fall back to the C99 standard since some of the compilers that I use do not support all C99 features like mixed declarations and code etc.p  pThus, I currently compile all my code with gcc on my 64bit Ubuntu development machine with codeWall Wextra pedantic stdgnu90code not C90 due to my use of unsigned long long etc. as described above to address all nonformatcompliant code parts. So far, I could adapt my code to get rid of all warnings but one I cannot find a proper printf format for sizet that does not yield a warning from gcc. Consider the following example code which illustrates most of the things that I triedp  precodeinclude ltstdint.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int main    printfzu, sizeofint  C99 format specifier for sizet    printfu, sizeofint  Treat sizet as unsigned int    printflu, sizeofint  Treat sizet as unsigned long int only works when sizet is typedefed to unsigned long int    return 0  codepre  pWhen compiled with codeWall Wextra pedantic stdgnu90code, I get warnings for the first two linesp  blockquote   ptest.c63 warning ISO C90 does not support the z gnuprintf length modifier [Wformat]   test.c73 warning format u expects argument of type unsigned int, but argument 2 has type long unsigned int [Wformat]p blockquote  pAlthough I do not get a warning for the third line, this is only the case on my development system. On other systems, specifically on those where sizet is some custom type or not typedefed as unsigned long long, there will still be a warning.p  pI am well aware that there is no format specifier for sizet in C90, but that there is one in C99. However, I thought that setting codestdgnu90code would give me the z format specifier, but that assumption turned out to be incorrect.p  pSince I could not get rid of the warnings, I tried to define a format specifier with some preprocessor definitions like thisp  precodeinclude ltinttypes.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  ifdef GNUC   define GLUEx, y, z xyz   define GLUEFORMATprefix, size GLUEPRI, prefix, size   define UINTFORMATsize GLUEFORMATu, size   define SIZETFORMAT UINTFORMATSIZEOFSIZET else  C99 fallback    define SIZETFORMAT zu endif  int main    printf SIZETFORMAT, sizeofint   return 0  codepre  pI thought that this should give me the proper format specifier, the only constraint being that sizet is unsigned which it is on all my target platforms so far. However, that does not work eitherp  blockquote   ptest.c153 warning format u expects argument of type unsigned int, but argument 2 has type long unsigned int [Wformat]p blockquote  pIs there any way, given the constraints, to overcome this warning or to find a more elegant solution without resorting to codestdc99codep  pBest regards Andreasp

I will try to explain my issue here.p  pI have some states set up like thisp  precodestateProvider.statedesigner,      url sportdesigner,     abstract true,     templateUrl appdesignerindex.tpl.html,     controller DesignerController,     controllerAs controller .statedesigner.team,      url ,     templateUrl appdesignerteam.tpl.html .statedesigner.kit,      url kit,     templateUrl appdesignerkit.tpl.html .statedesigner.design,      url design,     templateUrl appdesignerdesign.tpl.html .statedesigner.refine,      url refine,     templateUrl appdesignerrefine.tpl.html .statedesigner.order,      url order,     templateUrl appdesignerorder.tpl.html .statedesigner.save,      url save,     templateUrl appdesignersave.tpl.html,     data          requireLogin true       codepre  pThe idea is simple, there are a few steps that allow a user to customise a kit. When they get to the last step save they have to login  register in order to save for obvious reasons. So I build my controller like thisp  precode.controllerDesignerController, [stateParams, Api, Array, TemplateService, function stateParams, api, array, service      var self  this,         slug  stateParams.sport           Empty model to handle the first time loading     self.kit           loading false,         data              name ,              selectedGarments [],             selectedDesign Angelus,             total 00.00,              team                  name ,                 clubName ,                 sport ,                  selectedColours []                                 self.sport  api.getcategories,  slug slug   Get our sport     self.colours  [000000, FFFFFF, 00adef, ed008c, fef200, 2e3192, 00a652, ed1b24, c7c8ca, f14e23, 6c9d30, c0d731, f5a3c7, 816ab0, 082140, 1e4f2f, 5bcaf5, f04e3f, f68b1f, cdbe01, ee4d9b, 007193, 5f1e08, 841c3d]  Get current colours     self.designs  [Angelus, Claudius, Equitius, Fang, Valerius]  Get current designs     self.garments   loading true   Empty object to be populated by service       After we get our sport, get our garments     self.sport.promise.thenfunction             Get the category id         var categoryId  self.sport.data[0].id           Get all the garments that belong to that category         self.garments  api.getproducts,  categoryId categoryId             Set our colours     self.setColour  function colour          var colours  self.kit.data.team.selectedColours          array.modifycolours, colour            Set our design     self.setDesign  function design          self.kit.data.selectedDesign  design            Set our garments     self.setGarment  function garment          var garments  self.kit.data.selectedGarments          array.modifygarments, garment      ] codepre  pNow, as you can see the strongself.kitstrong object is pretty much blank to start. Each strongstatestrong handles different parts of the view model. p  ul liTeam  handles all the team stuffli liKit  handles the garment selectionli liDesign  handles the selected designli liOrder  doesnt modify the view model, but it uses all the previous strongstatestrong data to display informationli liSave  is when the kit is savedli ul  pSo, my question is is there anyway to prevent loading the next state if the previous state values have not been completed And also, can you redirect to a state depending on what values have been completed on load I plan on holding the strongkitstrong in sessionStoragep
Negative 2097 pWhat is the most secure way to submit large, extensible forms with CakePHP 2.4 and SecurityComponentp  pI have a form on my app which creates new fields to store new subrecords and emsubemsubrecords using jQuery. This clashes with Cakes SecurityComponent, which expects all fields on a submitted form to have been created serverside by FormHelper.p  pIn the past, when Ive been only saving records across one association, Ive been able to limit fields userside to a high but workable number like 100, and explicitly unlock each and every possible field the form could generatep  precodewhilei lt 100     thisgtFormgtunlockFieldChildModel. . i . .value i      unlock other fields for that possible record  codepre  pHowever, with this new form I have to save data across not one but strongtwostrong relationships. Users can potentially create a lot of subrecords or subsubrecords, so the namespace codeChildModel.[1100].field, ChildModel.[1100].GrandchildModel.[1100].fieldcode starts to get huge. Unlocking a namespace of strongtens of thousandsstrong of possible fields, very few of which are going to be used but all of which are potentially going to be needed, starts to sound really crazy.p  pWhat solutions have other CakePHP devs found to get around this issue I presume this is something that other people have encountered, where disabling Security for the entire action is simply not an option.p

Negative 2097 pAfter upgrading my iOS devices to iOS 8.3 I noticed some weird behavior with the meta viewport initial scale property. If I set the initial scale under 1.0 and rotate my device while I am on a webpage, the whole content will get progressively smaller and eventually the browser will crash.p  pI noticed that the amount of how much smaller the content gets with each orientation change is linked to how much you set the initial scale. For example if I set it to 0.9, the content will get 10 smaller every time. If I set it to 0.6, the content will get 40 smaller every time.p  pDue to the nature of this bug, it cannot be put or experienced on jsfiddle.

Negative 2097 pI am writing an accessibility service for Android which aims at providing different alternatives for people with physical disabilities to control a device, for instance, using switches, scanning, head tracking, and others. p  pCurrently, to perform the actual actions on the applications interface we use the accessibility API, basically the AccessibilityNodeInfo.performAction method. This works fine most of the time, but we found some important restrictionsp  ul liMost keyboards IME just do not work. We only had success with the Google keyboard on Lollipop API 22 and had to use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28678665howcaniuseaccessibilityservicegetwindowstoobtainatraversableaccessibAccessibilityService.getWindowsa. For lower API versions we had to develop a special keyboard undoubtedly not the optimal solution.li liMost games are not accessible. DOT. They do not export a AccessibilityNodeInfo tree.li liWeb navigation is not practical no scrolling, among other issues.li ul  pA solution would be to use a different API to perform the actions, and it seems that android.app.UiAutomation would fit the purpose. According to the documentation It also allows injecting of arbitrary raw input events simulating user interaction with keyboards and touch devices which is what I am looking for although I understand that UiAutomation is intended for testing purposes and, perhaps, not ready for production quality code and that, perhaps, might not behave the same on different devices. I also understand that such an API might a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7695258movingmousepointeronandroidscreenprogramaticallybe a security holea if any application could use it. But it seems reasonable to allow an accessibility service to use UiAutomation given that AccessibilityNodeInfo.performAction provides similar powers. p  pSo, I tried the following inside my accessibility servicep  precode Instrumentation i  new Instrumentation  UiAutomation automation  i.getUiAutomation codepre  pBut getUiAutomation always returns null.p  pIs there any option to use UiAutomation or similar API inside an accessibility service p  pBTW rooting the device is not an option to us so we cannot a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17972892injectionoftoucheventsusingscreendriverinject events through the screen driverap

Negative 2097 pI working on a JavaMaven project. I use codemvn testcode to run my test suite. However, in this case all assertions are enabled. Unfortunately this increase the time of some operation from codelogncode to coden2code which is rather inconvenient. What is more is that the operation is defined in a dependency codepackageAcode whereas I work on codepackageBcode. Using plain Java I could add codeeapackageB...code to enable only the assertions which I actually need. Is it possible to achieve this behaviour using either the content of the codepom.xmlcode or a command line argument to codemvncode I know I can disable emallem assertions but I would rather keep the assertions in the package that I am actually working on...p
Negative 2097 pI am trying to replicate the autocomplete functionality of the neo4j browser interface using only a cypher query. A successful implementation would mean that if the query is executed in the browser, toggling the autocomplete button would have no effect, as all additional relationships are specified in the query.p  pI use the browser to prototype the queries, then use RNeo4j to implement them.

Negative 2097 pI was curious to know the internals of template class compilation in specific circumstances. I ask this because Id like to extend some existing classes.p  pFor example, lets assume a startingp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class LargeClass    private     stduniqueptrltTgt data      many other fields    public     const stduniqueptrltTgtamp getData  return data      void setDataT value  data.resetvalue       many other methods that dont depend on T  codepre  pThis example makes me think that, since codesizeofstduniqueptrltTgt  sizeofTcode without a custom deleter then codesizeofLargeClassltT1gt  sizeofLargeClassltT2gtcode for any T1 and T2. Which implies that all codeoffsetoffield, LargeClassltTgtcode are the same for any field and T.p  pSo why the compiler would create a copy of each codeLargeClasscode method if they dont depend on codeTcodep  pA different approach, likep  precodeclass LargeClass    private     T data     ...    private     ...  codepre  pinstead should force the compiler to create multiple definitions of the methods for different types since codesizeofTcode could change, but using an codestdalignedstoragecode with a codestaticassertcode to avoid storing too large data could make this fallback to the first case. Would a compiler be smart enough to realise itp  pIn general I was wondering if a compiler is smart enough to avoid generating multiple definition of a template class method if the type variable is not used and the class structure doesnt change or at least doesnt change for accessing the fields accessed in the method or not. Does the standard enforce anything about itp

Negative 2097 pI am creating a single page application with AngularJS and I am starting to really like this way of creating web applications. I use PHP as backend language and the service is set up as a RESTish API.p  pNow I face the problem of updating stuff. Since the page is practically never refreshed, I have to do some kind of polling, or long polling do check the server if any change has been made, and then let the user know about the change through notifications.p  pAs I understand, I might be wrong, that it is not very efficient if I am to do checks every 10  30 seconds if there has been a change. I would have to check if the user is logged in with JSON Web Tokens, check the database, json encode and so on, it would be very hard on the server. And as I understand PHP is not very good with websockets. What should I dop  pI need to check if the user has gotten any new messages, or new comments on posts, or other notifications. My project has completely stopped because I have lately been looking at Go as an alternative to PHP, and because of that reason I have lost the momentum that I had.p  pEDIT A couple of things I have thought about is to only run the polls if the user has moved the mouse within 30 seconds, so that I dont need to do updates when the user is not even using the site but the site is just opened in a tab that is unused. If 1000 people have a tab opened but are not using the site, then that in my opinion is a lot of wasted resources. What do you guys thinkp

Negative 2097 pI am building a website using Sails, a page of which contains a form. This form has multiple text inputs, and a file upload input for the user to upload an image. The information from all text inputs are stored in a Postgres database, and the image is uploaded using the code.uploadcode function described in the sails docs a hrefhttpsailsjs.orgdocumentationconceptsfileuploads relnofollowherea and converted to a data uri which is then stored in the same Postgres database and used to display the image on the site.p  pThe file input is the third to last input on the page, and I noticed that two things were happening p  p1 The text in the two inputs strongafterstrong the file input was not being passed through to the controller as part of codereq.bodycode, as form inputs normally are.p  p2 No data uri was stored in the database for some images. p  pI created a new basic sails app with a form that allows you to upload an image and exactly the same thing happens here.p  pUpon testing I discovered that small images work fine, while larger images do not. The small image I used was 66kb, while another 800kb image produced the same effects mentioned above. p  pThe new sails app, in the callback to the code.uploadcode function, coderes.viewcodes another page that simply displays the uploaded image. With the 800kb image and larger images, by the time the page was rendered, instead of displaying the uploaded image, it displayed a broken image. In the chrome dev console it gave a 404 error for the image link, but if I add a query to the end of the image url i.e. make chrome think its a different url so reload the same image, the image displays fine. From this I am guessing that the code.uploadcode callback is being called before the image is actually finished uploading, and by the time I have reloaded the image it has finished uploading.p  pI can see in the request headers that the inputs after the file input are being sent, but doing codeconsole.logreq.bodycode in the controller only logs out the inputs placed before the file input in the form.p  pI am using sails v0.11.0, and the code I am using is as followsp  pHTML form index.ejsp  precodelth1gtImage Upload Testlth1gt  ltform methodpost enctypemultipartformdata actionsubmitgt    ltdivgt     ltinput typetext namefirstInputgt   ltdivgt    ltdivgt     ltinput typefile nameimagegt   ltdivgt    ltdivgt     ltinput typetext nameimageUploaded valuefalsegt   ltdivgt    ltdivgt     ltinput typehidden nametest valuehellogt   ltdivgt    ltbutton typesubmitgtUploadltbuttongt    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     inputfile.changefunction        input[nameimageUploaded].valtrue        ltscriptgt  ltformgt codepre  pconfigroutes.jsp  precodemodule.exports.routes       ImageController.show,   submit ImageController.create codepre  pThe controller ImageController.jsp  precodemodule.exports       show functionreq, res          res.viewindex.ejs     ,      create functionreq, res           var fileName  image  Date.now  .jpg      req.fileimage     .uploadsaveAs dirname  ....assetsimages  fileName, functionerr, uploadedFiles        if err return res.serverErrorerr              console.logfile uploaded             console.log             console.logreq.body              res.viewuploadedImage, fileName fileName               codepre  pThe page to display the uploaded image uploadedImage.ejsp  precodeltif typeoffileName  undefined gt   lta hrefgt     ltimg srcimagesltfileNamegt stylewidth100 height100gt   ltagt ltgt codepre  pCan anyone explain why this is happening and help me to fix it p  pThanksp
Negative 2097 pIs there a way modify the attributes of Field annotations at runtime Not just the annotation object you can get from a Field at any one point, but whenever in the future you get the same annotation it is updated with the new values.p  pMy task is to be able to at runtime compile a Java file and then use that Class in the application. Ive done that, but the only problem is that while in a standard Java application custom annotations do get saved, they are for some reason stripped when run on a Spring application running on Tomcat 7. This is all in memory compilation BTW, no files are ever created in the process.p  pI couldnt find any way to solve that issue, so I decided to just parse the Java file a second time and add annotations to whatever fields I needed to. I figured out how to add an annotation to a field which didnt have any before through some hacks, but now I need to configure it, seeing as the annotation has some attributes, several booleans and an int. p  pIve looked into several ways provided in a lot of StackOverflow questions, but they all modify the annotation object that you obtain through reflection, and if I in another method try to get the same annotation, its values are reset. Any insight into the matter would be greatly appreciated.p

Likely because COM1 is already in use for stdout.p  pEnvironment Console Application, Windows 7, MinGWp  pAm I doing something wrong Is there another or better way to accomplish the redirectionp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 2097 pIm currently trying to create a little helper class that can make one image out of multiple images. It should take the size of the screen and take equal parts of all images and then combine them to one single image that has a little piece of all images side by side.p  pSo far my class successfully creates such an image. The only trouble I have is an enomours amount of used RAM after I created this image. Do you have any suggestions how I can improve the RAM usage after i created that image I dont want to run out of memory Maybe Im wasting memory the way I create the images Im open for better suggestions.  Important to know is that I can not cache these images on disk since they will never be the same.p  pWhat I noticed was that once I run a manual GC RAM usage goes back from around 70MiB to 15MiB.p  precodeprivate LruCacheltInteger, Bitmapgt mMemoryCache private ListltIntegergt IDs  new ArrayListltgt private CombinerTask task  private void combineImagesboolean useScreenSize         iftask  null             task.canceltrue         task  new CombinerTaskuseScreenSize         if Build.VERSION.SDKINT gt Build.VERSIONCODES.HONEYCOMB               task.executeOnExecutorAsyncTask.THREADPOOLEXECUTOR          else               task.execute                class CombinerTask extends AsyncTaskltVoid,Void,Bitmapgt     private boolean useScreenSize      public CombinerTaskboolean useScreenSize         this.useScreenSize  useScreenSize           Override     protected Bitmap doInBackgroundVoid...voids          Bitmap bmOverlay         ifuseScreenSize             WindowManager wm  WindowManager ImageCombiner.getInstance.getSystemServiceContext.WINDOWSERVICE             Display display  wm.getDefaultDisplay             Point size  new Point             display.getSizesize              forint x  0 x lt IDs.size x                 float scaleFactor  floatsize.y  floatmMemoryCache.getIDs.getx.getHeight                 Bitmap temp  Bitmap.createScaledBitmapmMemoryCache.getIDs.getx,intmMemoryCache.getIDs.getx.getWidth  scaleFactor, intmMemoryCache.getIDs.getx.getHeight  scaleFactor,false                 mMemoryCache.putIDs.getx,temp                           bmOverlay  Bitmap.createBitmapsize.x,size.y,mMemoryCache.getIDs.get0.getConfig         else              bmOverlay  Bitmap.createBitmapmMemoryCache.getIDs.get0.getWidth,mMemoryCache.getIDs.get0.getHeight,mMemoryCache.getIDs.get0.getConfig                   Canvas canvas  new CanvasbmOverlay          forint i  0 i lt IDs.size i             Bitmap bm  Bitmap.createBitmapmMemoryCache.getIDs.geti,mMemoryCache.getIDs.geti.getWidth3,0,bmOverlay.getWidthmMemoryCache.size,mMemoryCache.getIDs.geti.getHeight             canvas.drawBitmapbm,bm.getWidthi,0,null             bm.recycle                  canvas  null         return bmOverlay           Override     protected void onPostExecuteBitmap bitmap          iflistener  null             listener.combineFinishedbitmap         for int i  0 i lt IDs.size i             mMemoryCache.getIDs.geti.recycle                  mMemoryCache  null         IDs  null       codepre  pAny suggestions are welcome.
