Positive 321 pSo, Im attempting to scan in a large number of words from a text file and store them in a manner that allows them to be accessible from a single array.p  precode149256 aahing aahs aals aardvark aardvarks aardwolf aardwolves aargh aarrgh aarrghh codepre  pIm scanning these words from a text file in the above format. The number is the total number of wordsits a dictionary, explains the high word count present in the list, and the words follow a line at a time. Id like to be able to access each individual word from a dynamically allocated  array i.e. word[0] will contain aahing. Now I know a simple char array is unable to accomplish this. I first attempted to accomplish this with a multidimensional array in the below codep  precodemain int numWords,i  FILE  fp fopendictionary.txt,r  fscanffp,d, ampnumWords  char array  mallocnumWords  20  sizeofchar word length is always below 20     fori  0 i lt numWords i           fscanffp, s, amparray[i]          printfs n,amparray[i] used to check the scan      printfs n,amparray[0]  codepre  pThe amp infront of the array shouldnt be needed by my understadning, but the program crashes when these are not present, probably a problem with my code. p  pNow when removing the final printf statement and uncommenting the printf in the loop, the program seems to work as it is meant to. But, if you add the last printf,the program prints the first letter of every single word scanned along with the entirety of the last word. From my understanding this shouldnt be possible as each new word should have been scanned into a different row of the array, but obviously this is not the case. In this instance would I be better of somehow assigning each slot of an array to point towards a new array in each slot i.e. array[1]  data[] , array[2]  data[] each of which would contain a new word.  A point in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.p

I think it must have something to do with the fact that all elements of the struct are pointers but not match.p  pI can set the match value from the driver file after the sample is initialized and everything is fine but if I set it within the initialization i get varying behavior depending on what computer is running it. Some crash some just have no output and some still work for some reason.p  pSo I guess my question now is.. How do I set a value inside a struct via a struct pointerp  pUPDATE I eventually found the problem. One of the functions was alocating memory the size of sample witch is a pointer to a struct rather than alocating the size of the struct itself. For some reason created no problems at all unless the a value in the struct was accessed from within the function initializing it. Witch would in turn make the very next use of malloc crash the program. Where as it was fine accessing the structs from the driver c file.p  pSo my guess is that as I was allocating memory size of struct pointer and not size of struct allocates a tiny excess of unused memory each time its called and windows doesnt like it.p  pThink thats what happened anyway.p

Ive been surfing around trying to get a better understanding of what malloc actually does but I want to test and check if my array is being filled. p  pmy program is pulling from a text file with nothing but strings and I am attempting to put that data into a 2d array. p  precodeforindex  0 index lt linesallocated index for loop to fill array 128 lines at a timearbitrary number     words[index]  mallocsizeofchar     ifwords[index]  NULL         perrortoo many characters         exit2          check for end of file     whilefeoftxtfile          words  fgetswords, 64, txtfile         putswords         realloc if nessesary         if linesallocated  index  1             reallocwords, linesallocated  linesallocated                 get 3rd value placed printfs, words[3] codepre  psince this just a gist, below here ive closed and freed the memory, The output is being displayed using puts, but not from the printf from the bottom. an ELI5 version of reading files to an array would be amazing. p  pThank you in advance p
Positive 321 pSo were learning how to use dynamic arrays with malloc and such and Im basically going nuts on trying to learn how to use this thing. At the surface on what Im trying to do is have a user enter a crossword puzzle and have the program solve it but I cant even get through the first step of successfully storing the puzzle. p  pHeres my codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int main       char userInput  malloc sizeofchar4      allocates columns with a length of 4     char grid  mallocsizeofchar4     int i, j      fori0 ilt4 i         scanfs, userInput         for j0 jlt4 j              allocates rows with a length of 4             grid[i]  char malloc sizeofchar4             grid[i][j]  userInput[j]                    printfc, grid[0][2]      return 0  codepre  pIts hard coded now but itll ask the size of the grid but what its doing is taking a 4x4 crossword puzzle and putting each letter into a character array and later on itll find the words in the puzzle.

A sample on what Im trying to do with my code isp  precodeInput abcd efgh ijkl mnop  Output c codepre  pbut what ends up being spit out is garbage.p  pIm using code blocks but when I debug malloc arrays and I set them to watch I have no idea whats in them.

Positive 321 pIm trying to use dynamic memory allocation with a 2D array and I cant seem to get my function to work as intended. I want to pass my function a long string of characters, break up and store certain parts as individual strings in their own character arrays, then add them to a 2D array and return the final thing. The part of the function that splits the string up and stores what I want works fine. The memory allocation is what Im doing wrong.p  pFor example, I pass my function the string  0,,10000,10000,Albany Hwy After Armadale Rd,,32.1479054960,116.0201957650,4 and it pulls out 10000, 32.1479054960 and 116.0201957650, stores them in their own arrays, then adds it all into one array called stop.

Positive 321 pSituation  I am using a third party stack. I have a source code of the third party. This code is quite clumsy and a there are a lot of problems related to buffer overrun.p  pMy Solution  In order to trace down this issue, I am overriding the existing functions like sprintf and memcpy to check if there is a buffer overrun.p  pHere is what I have done so far to override malloc and sprintf. p  precodedefine memcpy mymemcpy void  mymemcpyvoid s1, const void s2, sizet n            void libcmemcpyvoid,const void,sizet  dlsymRTLDNEXT, memcpy        return libcmemcpys1,s2,n      codepre  pNext, I have used sprintf  p  precodedefine sprintf  mysprintf  int mysprintfchar str, const char format, ...    valist args   vastartargs, format   vsprintfstr,format, args   vaendargs   return 0   codepre  pMy problem  I want the overridden function to print when the buffer  destination is of less capacity, then what we are writing to it. p  pI need the solution, which will work for stack allocated memory like char buff[5] and char buff  char  malloc5p  pSo, lets say, when we do memcpy on the buff with the string size 6 bytes, then the overriden memcpy should throw an error. Similarly, when we sprintf, the overriden sprintf should throw an error. The major problem is sprintf. I want to use snprintf rather than sprintf. Its difficult to look into every piece of code and change to snprintf. So, What I want to do here is to override sprintf with my version and internally call snprintf, where I will compute n based on the size of the arg. Also, I will compare if the n is less than buffer size or not. The bottleneck is how to find the size of the buffer based on the pointer passed.p

Positive 321 pI have been attempting to wrap my head around an idea that I am certain is possible, I just am not sure if I am going about it in the right way. My intention is to create an array and then fill it with as many values as the user wants. However my goal is to not use any defined value per se. I would like to be able to continue increasing it the amount of values it can contain indefinitely.p  pThis is the test code I have been using to try and figure this outp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid          int i         int Up         int Ary[0]          printfPlease enter the number of integers you want to input          scanfd, ampUp         fori  0 i lt Up i                          printfPlease enter a number                  Ary[i]  int mallocsizeofint                 scanfd, ampAry[i]                  fori  0 i lt Up i                          printfd , Ary[i]                 ifi  10  0                                          printfn                                   return 0  codepre  pThis may be a poor way of attempting to figure this out and I may also be doing this is a completely wrong way However I get a segmentation fault sometimes. If I use small values such as only entering 4 or 5 values it works fine, however if I enter 10 values it gives me a segmentation fault. If I enter 50 values, it lets me enter all 50 but gives me a segmentation fault after printing out the 41st value. p  pThe code itself is simply a means to an end. Ultimately what I would like to know is how I can set up an array of anything that can have values added to it indefinitely while retaining previous values using dynamic memory allocation p  pemPS. I hope this defines my question well enough, however if it does not I would like to refine my question so it is more clear. Please make a comment if this is unclear and why.emp

Negative 321 pIve done quite a bit of searching on this and havent had much luck finding something cohesive.  Im a relatively new developer and have just started in my first professional development position.  I know that I have a great deal to learn even in the realm of the basics.  Based on listening to PodCasts, reading blogs, papers etc Ive come to understand that keeping separation of concerns, IOC, Dependency Injection in mind when designing and building software seems to be the right thing to do.  I get the concepts at a VERY high level and want to approach what I do with this in mined as much as I can.p  pSo, heres the rub.  HOW the heck do I design stuff this way  I work on a team that has inherited a web based product that is very tightly coupled, very poorly documented and generally not an easy to maintain bit of sofware.  Evryone seems to like the idea of removing some of this couple.  They like the idea of developing automated tests which from what Ive read is easier to do with loosely coupled components.  Nobody seems to know how to do it.  Im willing to take a stab at it, but I need guidance.  Everything Ive found always seems to talk about this stuff in a very high level way, or conversely, focuses on just a small piece of the whole.  Id like some guidance on a book, or series of tutorials, or videos, or SOMETHING that takes a somewhat realworld example and shows you how to apply these principles.  Ideally, Id LOVE to see something that says...Take this order entry app, for example.  THIS is how most people put it together today using standard ADO.NET DataSets, blah...blah...blah.  NOW If we apply the IOC principles to make this a loosely coupled project, heres what you do differently.  Heres WHY you do it this way, and heres what you have to consider when you try to accomplish this.p  pI know this is a bit long winded, Im just a bit frustrated that most of the comprehensive trainig material out there that Ive found simply doesnt discuss this topic in a way that someone starting out can apply good practices from day one.p  pThanks all for your time.p  pStevep

Negative 321 pI have a problem I am trying to solve in an elegant manner. I have a .net application that I have created. I am trying to get one of the forms to be shown from a webpage. This sounds strange Ill admit, so here is the backstoryp  pWe have some large monitors at work, that show information on them. I have no control over how the information is displayed. Currently they are just using a browser and tabbing in the browser to show each different piece of information on the screen. Most of the info they show is just standard html stuff, text and images. p  pNow along comes my winforms application. The part of the application I need to show is a graphical display. Everything on this display is drawn using GDI, if that matters. I need to get this form into a format that I can show. Below is my own solution, but I am pretty sure this is not the best method, but it may be the only method I can usep  pCreate a console application. The application would do the following 1. Run as a service on a server 2. Create the display in memory, and save it to a bitmap every so ofter 3. Save the bitmap to a location on the network. 4. have an HTML file that links the image that can be shown in the browserp  pI though about doing something with the clients, however the clients are not always up, so I could have periods where the image wouldnt be updated. I also was thinking about an ASP.net solution, but that would require me to learn ASP.net, and I am not quite ready to take that challengep

All of the fields will come back in the query. Ever worse, if code like this is a child relationship, a call to the database gets made for every child. This is unacceptable in our situation.p  pAdditional notesp  pBandwidth is at a premium.

Negative 321 pDoes anyone know how to recursively delete empty directories with ANT empty includes directories that only contain .svn etc.p  pI know ant allows you to includeEmptyDirstrue but I want it to ONLY delete a directory if it is empty and actually Id probably need to walk up the recursive chain and delete the directory it was contained in if it is now empty.p  pBasically as part of our build process we copy over a set of directories that contain a bunch of other nested directories containing various XML and data, and when we move the location for that data our copy and checkin build process doesnt really work, and because we are checking into another source control SVN, wiping out the directories and copying over isnt really an option either wed be blowing away the .svn folders.p  pBefore we copy over the new builds I can clear out the directories by doing the followingp  precodeltdeletegt   ltfileset dirwebplatformBin includesgt ltdeletegt codepre  pThis leaves every directory with the .svn as an empty directory and then I copy over the new files.

Whilst I could calculate the aspect ratio of the photo, and work out the new y value to keep it centred, I would have to include a codemxMovecode effect too, and I am hopful that Flex has a simpler way.p  pThis is for a photo gallery where images are loaded at runtime, and swapped about, so I really would like to avoid recalculating the aspect ratio and vertical position every time the updateComplete event fires. It seems so messy.p  pI tried putting my image inside a codemxVBoxcode with codeverticalAlignmiddlecode, thinking that the box would do all the centering for me, but this only seems to happen when the app first starts  i need it to gradually adjust the position during the period where the effect plays to keep it central even when partway through.p  pHeres a strippeddown example which doesnt workp  precodeltmxApplication xmlnsmxhttpwww.adobe.com2006mxml layoutabsolute width600 height600gt  ltmxResize idfxResize targetimgPhotoA widthTo350 duration500 gt  ltmxButton x10 y10 labelResize clickfxResize.play gt  ltmxVBox idboxPhotoA x100 y20 height500 width350 verticalAlignmiddle  borderStylesolid verticalScrollPolicyoff horizontalScrollPolicyoffgt     ltmxImage idimgPhotoA width60 maintainAspectRatiotrue sourcehttpsstatic.netsoimglogo.pnggt ltmxVBoxgt  ltmxApplicationgt codepre  pI am a newcomer to Flex, so apologies if I am doing something daft.

Negative 321 pUsing C 3.5 I am trying to generate dynamic types at runtime using reflection emit. I used the a hrefhttpmsdn2.microsoft.comenusvcsharpbb894665.aspxDynamic Query Librarya sample from Microsoft to create a class generator. Everything works, my problem is that 100 generated types inflate the memory usage by approximately 25MB. This is a completely unacceptable memory profile as eventually I want to support having several hundred thousand types generated in memory. p  pMemory profiling shows that the memory is apparently being held by various System.Reflection.Emit types and methods though I cant figure out why.

Negative 321 pId been searching for a way to do cookie based authenticationsessions in Google App Engine because I dont like the idea of memcache based sessions, and I also dont like the idea of forcing users to create google accounts just to use a website. I stumbled across someones a hrefhttpblog.jeremi.infoentrystoringdataincookiesinasecuremanner relnofollowpostinga that mentioned some signed cookie functions from the Tornado framework and it looks like what I need. What I have in mind is storing a users id in a tamper proof cookie, and maybe using a decorator for the request handlers to test the authentication status of the user, and as a side benefit the user id will be available to the request handler for datastore work and such. The concept would be similar to forms authentication in ASP.NET. This code comes from the web.py module of the Tornado framework.p  pAccording to the docstrings, it Signs and timestamps a cookie so it cannot be forged and Returns the given signed cookie if it validates, or None.p  pIve tried to use it in an App Engine Project, but I dont understand the nuances of trying to get these methods to work in the context of the request handler. Can someone show me the right way to do this without losing the functionality that the FriendFeed developers put into it The setsecurecookie, and getsecurecookie portions are the most important, but it would be nice to be able to use the other methods as well.p  precodeusrbinenv python  import Cookie import base64 import time import hashlib import hmac import datetime import re import calendar import email.utils import logging  def utf8s     if isinstances, unicode         return s.encodeutf8     assert isinstances, str     return s  def unicodes     if isinstances, str         try             return s.decodeutf8         except UnicodeDecodeError             raise HTTPError400, Nonutf8 argument     assert isinstances, unicode     return s   def timeindependentequalsa, b     if lena  lenb         return False     result  0     for x, y in zipa, b         result  ordx  ordy     return result  0  def cookiesself     A dictionary of Cookie.Morsel objects.     if not hasattrself,cookies         self.cookies  Cookie.BaseCookie         if Cookie in self.request.headers             try                 self.cookies.loadself.request.headers[Cookie]             except                 self.clearallcookies     return self.cookies  def cookiesignatureself,parts     self.requiresettingcookiesecret,secure cookies     hash  hmac.newself.application.settings[cookiesecret],                     digestmodhashlib.sha1     for part in partshash.updatepart     return hash.hexdigest  def getcookieself,name,defaultNone     Gets the value of the cookie with the given name,else default.     if name in self.cookies         return self.cookies[name].value     return default  def setcookieself,name,value,domainNone,expiresNone,path,                expiresdaysNone     Sets the given cookie namevalue with the given options.     name  utf8name     value  utf8value     if re.searchr[x00x20],name  value          Dont let us accidentally inject bad stuff         raise ValueErrorInvalid cookie rr  name,value     if not hasattrself,newcookies         self.newcookies  []     newcookie  Cookie.BaseCookie     self.newcookies.appendnewcookie     newcookie[name]  value     if domain         newcookie[name][domain]  domain     if expiresdays is not None and not expires         expires  datetime.datetime.utcnow  datetime.timedelta             daysexpiresdays     if expires         timestamp  calendar.timegmexpires.utctimetuple         newcookie[name][expires]  email.utils.formatdate             timestamp,localtimeFalse,usegmtTrue     if path         newcookie[name][path]  path  def clearcookieself,name,path,domainNone     Deletes the cookie with the given name.     expires  datetime.datetime.utcnow  datetime.timedeltadays365     self.setcookiename,value,pathpath,expiresexpires,                     domaindomain  def clearallcookiesself     Deletes all the cookies the user sent with this request.     for name in self.cookies.iterkeys         self.clearcookiename  def setsecurecookieself,name,value,expiresdays30,kwargs     Signs and timestamps a cookie so it cannot be forged     timestamp  strinttime.time     value  base64.b64encodevalue     signature  self.cookiesignaturename,value,timestamp     value  .join[value,timestamp,signature]     self.setcookiename,value,expiresdaysexpiresdays,kwargs  def getsecurecookieself,name,includenameTrue,valueNone     Returns the given signed cookie if it validates,or None     if value is Nonevalue  self.getcookiename     if not valuereturn None     parts  value.split     if lenparts  3return None     if includename         signature  self.cookiesignaturename,parts[0],parts[1]     else         signature  self.cookiesignatureparts[0],parts[1]     if not timeindependentequalsparts[2],signature         logging.warningInvalid cookie signature r,value         return None     timestamp  intparts[1]     if timestamp lt time.time  31  86400         logging.warningExpired cookie r,value         return None     try         return base64.b64decodeparts[0]     except         return None codepre  puid12341234567890d32b9e9c67274fa062e2599fd659cc14  p  pPartsbr    1. uid is the name of the keybr    2. 1234 is your value in clearbr    3. 1234567890 is the timestampbr    4. d32b9e9c67274fa062e2599fd659cc14 is the signature made from the value and the timestamp  p

Negative 321 pIve successfully built SDL from source using bcc 5.5.1 but any SDL test application using it crashes right away at startup. Im looking for some help andor guidance on how to resolve this issue.p  pJust to fill in some info, SDL1.2.14 was used. The projects compiled as a dll with multithreading enabled and linked to C runtime dynamically. Ive also rebuilt it with debugging info. When I step through with a debugger up to the point of crash it seems to be coming from redirectstdout in the sdlmain. If I remove sdlmain.lib and use the source file sdlwin32main.c directly in the SDL test project then that doesnt crash anymore. Instead it just crashes later on at SDLInit routine. p  pIve already checked the calling conventions used and they all seem to match up  everything is using cdecl. Ive also checked and made sure the compiled sdl.dll and the test application was using the same dynamic c runtime instead of statically linked. p  pThe SDL wiki under Borland section mentions to use the b to make sure enums are same size as int but that option is enabled by the compiler by default unless explicitly turned off. I did rebuild SDL with that compilerlinker switch just to be sure though.p  pWhen it crashes, its always a access violation in trying to write to some addressc000005. Like for example during a typical SDL init attempt like thisp  precode initialize SDL video if  SDLInit SDLINITVIDEO  lt 0       printf Unable to init SDL sn, SDLGetError      return 1  codepre  pAfter the call into SDLInit, control doesnt flow back into the test application. Instead it crashes somewhere bizarre like somewhere in ntdll.dll with something having to do with NTDLL.RtlEnterCriticalSection. When I inspect the stack trace at that point I usually get something like thisp  precode77982269 0044A04C 0043F02B 0043F7C4 0043EF25 SDLCreateSemaphore1 SDLCreateMutex SDLCreateSemaphore1 SDLCreateMutex SDLCreateSemaphore1 SDLCreateMutex SDLCreateSemaphore1 SDLCreateMutex SDLCreateSemaphore1 SDLCreateMutex SDLCreateSemaphore1 SDLCreateMutex SDLCreateSemaphore1 and it keeps recursing... looks like a stackover P codepre  pIm not sure whatelse to try at this point as Im pretty stumped.

Negative 321 pAs part of the process of replacing some old code that used an incredibly slow nested select, Ive ended up with a query that looks like thisp  precodeSELECT r3.rid AS r3id, r2.rid AS r2id, r1.rid AS r1id FROM tabler r3 LEFT JOIN    tabler r2   INNER JOIN      tabler r1     INNER JOIN tabled d ON r1.rid  d.rid    ON r2.rid  r1.parentid  ON r3.rid  r2.rid WHERE d.did  3 codepre  pSo in the innermost join, Im looking for the records in codetablercode copy coder1code which have a relationship with a subset of records from codetabledcode.p  pIn the next join out, Im looking for records in a second copy of codetablercode coder2code whose main index coderidcode matches the parent index codeparentidcode of the records from the previous join.p  pThen Im trying to do a codeLEFT JOINcode with a third copy of codetablercode coder3code, simply matching coderidcode with the coderidcode of the previous join. The idea of this outermost join is to get ALL of the records from codetablercode, but to then do the equivalent of a codeNOT INcode select by using a further condition not yet in my query to determine which records in coder3code have codeNULLscode for coder2idcode.p  pThe problem is that the codeLEFT JOINcode is not giving me the whole of codetablercode. Its giving me the same subset of records that I get without the final join  in other words, the same thing as an codeINNER JOINcode. So whereas Im expecting 1208 records, I get 508.p  pI know I must be doing something screwy here...p

Negative 321 pSo I have some perl code that goes something likep  precodeuse strict use XMLXPath   xml is an xml string read from file my returnVal  mySubAxml  ... some more code ...   sub definition sub mySubA    my xml     my xp  XMLXPathgtnewxml gt xml    my fields  xpgtfindelAelBelCgtgetnodelist     foreach elC, get desired info...   foreach my field fields      xp  XMLXPathgtnewcontext gt field     my info1  xpgtfindinfo1gtstringvalue     print nINFO1 info1      my info2  xpgtfindinfo2gtstringvalue       do some stuff....   return returnVal  codepre  pThis works fine and prints out INFO1 value... .  Im now changing the code, and am trying to get information from another section of the xml, and so Ive written a different sub for it.  To avoid parsing the same xml twice, Im trying to write my code only using 1 xpath object see a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgmsergeantXMLXPath1.13XPath.pmnew relnofollowXPath new in perl docsa.  p  pSo now my code is something like....p  precodeuse strict use XMLXPath   xml is an xml string read from file my xp  XMLXPathgtnewxml gt xml my returnValA  mySubAxp my returnValB  mySubBxp   ... some more code ...   sub definition sub mySubA    my xp      my fields  xpgtfindelAelBelCgtgetnodelist     foreach elC, get desired info...   foreach my field fields      xp  XMLXPathgtnewcontext gt field     my info1  xpgtfindinfo1gtstringvalue     print nINFO1 info1      my info2  xpgtfindinfo2gtstringvalue       do some stuff...   return returnVal   sub mySubB    my xp      do some stuff....   return returnVal  codepre  pSo, basically, Im passing the ref to the xpath object into mySubA instead of creating it within mySubA.  The problem is that no values are being found, even though Im pretty sure the xpath expression is resolving something because the loop iterates about 10 times.  Im new to perl, so I might be missing something here, but the thing that is confusing for me is that the second method  mySubB  is working fine kind of blowing away my first suspicion that there is a problem with passing the xpath object into the sub as in, Im not dereferencingreferencing the xpath object as I should be.p  pI dont know if its relevant or not, but the xml Im working with doesnt contain any namespaces or attributes.p

Negative 321 pI have a an element with thumbnails.  I allow users to sort their display order which fires off an update to the DB via ajax.

Negative 321 pPlain load has acquire semantics on x86, plain store has release semantics, however compiler still can reorder instructions. While fences and locked instructions locked xchg, locked cmpxchg prevent both hardware and compiler from reordering, plain loads and stores are still necessary to protect with compiler barriers. Visual C provides ReadWriterBarrier function, which prevents compiler from reordering, also C provides volatile keyword for the same reason. I write all this information just to make sure that I get everything right. So all written above is true, is there any reason to mark as volatile variables which are going to be used in functions protected with ReadWriteBarrierp  pFor examplep  precodeint loadintamp var      ReadWriteBarrier     T value  var     ReadWriteBarrier     return value  codepre  pIs it safe to make that variable nonvolatile As far as I understand it is, because function is protected and no reordering could be done by compiler inside. On the other hand Visual C provides special behavior for volatile variables different from the one that standard does, it makes volatile reads and writes atomic loads and stores, but my target is x86 and plain loads and stores are supposed to be atomic on x86 anyway, rightp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 321 pI have recently converted my workspace file format for my application to sqlite.  In order to ensure robust operation on NFS Ive used a common update policy, I do all modifications to a copy stored in a temp location on the local harddisk.  Only when saving do I modify the original file potentially on NFS by copying over the original file with the temp file.  I only open the orginal file to keep an exclusive lock on it so it someone else tries to open they will be warned that someone else is using it.p  pThe problem is this  When I go to save my temp file back over the original file I must release the lock on the orginal file, this provides a window for someone else to get in and take the original, albeit a small window.p  pI can think of a few ways around this p  p1 being to simply dump the contents of the temp in to the orginal by using sql, i.e. drop tables on original, vacumm original, select from temp and insert into orginal.  I dont like doing sql operations on a sqlite file stored on NFS though.  This scares me with corruptions issues.  Am I right to think like thisp  p2 Use various extra files to act as a guard to prevent other from coming in while copying the temp over the original.   Using files as a mutex is problematic at best.  I also dont like the idea of having extra files hanging around if the application crashes.p  pIm wondering if anyone has any different solutions for this.  Again to copy the temp file over the original file while ensuring other application dont sneak in and grab the original file while doing sop  pIm using python2.5, sqlalchemy 0.6.6 and sqlite 3.6.20p  pThanks, Deanp

Negative 321 pI have implemented the Microsoft WPF Ribbon in a WPF browser .NET application. It is a pretty simply layout with tabs, groups and buttons in the groups. There are however a LOT of groups and buttons and users are having a tough time using the Ribbon on smaller displays. Some of the groups convert the buttons to small image buttons with no text which the users dont like. They have to hover over each button to see its purpose. Other groups collapse completely and change to drop down buttons. This they want as standard. Each group to be represented as a drop down button by default and when clicking on it a list of the items as menu items.p  pTo get an idea of what I am after, you can simply reduce the window size until the groups collapse to this drop down effect with menu items.p  pCan someone helpp  pThe buttons are bound to the ribbon dynamically as are the tabs and groups.p  pTIA  Mikep

Negative 321 pHave a WCF Service being called to update records in the database.  If the connection is broken, the service will continue to process the data, but the client wont know of the results.  I.E. the processing could have succeeded or failed the client doesnt know if it should resend the data.p  pTypical example would be a bank deposit.  An ATM takes a deposit and makes a WCF call to update the customers account.  The connection is dropped, leaving the ATM uncertain as to whether the deposit was processed or not.  If it wasnt, and the ATM doesnt resend, the customer doesnt have the money in his account.  If the ATM resends, but the deposit was processed, hell have two deposits.p  pEnabling transactions on the WCF Service call seems the thing to do, but can they handle a dropped connection  I.E. the client can roll back the transaction if it loses connection to the server, but how would the server know about the rollback if the client isnt connectedp

Negative 321 pIm trying to use threads for the first time in a GCC C application which works fine in nonthreaded mode. When I run it some threads give results which are all zero instead of the required answers which I know for checking purposes, but the threads giving zeroes are not the same each time I run it. The ones which give nonzero answers are correct, so the code appears to run ok as such. I wonder if anyone can point out areas where I might have something which is not threadsafe.p  pMy own thoughts are it may be due to how I collect results or maybe memory allocation  I use malloc and free but elsewhere in StackOverflow I see that GCC malloc is considered threadsafe if linked with lpthread which I am doing. Nothing uses globalstatic variables  everything is passed as function arguments.p  pIn order to pass results back to main, my threaded routine uses an array of structures. Each thread writes to a distinct element of this array, so they are not trying to write to the same memory.

Since the connection is constant throughout the life cycle of the app it should probably be an intent service, but can you have a callable method within an intent service to send the data in the back ground over the back ground connectionp  pOr a service which connects the socket in the onStart method and then within the service implement an asynctask Im lostp

Negative 321 pIm currently building a data aquisition application, in which UI I placed the controls for mutually exclusive aquisition modes in the different subpages of a QToolbox, strongwhere the currently selected QToolbox item selects the aquisition mode parameter.strongp  pOne desired feature is to emlockem the UI  after changing the parameters, the changes have to be emappliedconfirmedem, being able to lock the UI elements against accidental changes is a feature, implemented by simply disabling the widgets. strongAnd since the aquisition mode is one parameter this also means locking down the QToolbox.strong However some controls within the toolbox need to stay unlocked since their effect is immediate.p  pSo heres the question In Qt4, how can I keep child widgets enabled and accessible while their container has been disables. Or how can I emulate the behaviour and look of such a setupp  pemPlease dont suggest changes in the UI. I had all people in my research group testing different UI concepts and the current one is the one that ist most intuitive and straightforward to use.emp
Negative 321 pI am working on a project using Maven and Eclipse m2eclipse plugin. Ive got problems with the JUnit tests p  pSometimes, when running them within Eclipse, they wont be compiled, but the old class files are used instead. When I delete the class files, I get codeClassNotFoundExceptionscode in Eclipse. I then have to manually recompile them by using codemvn testcompilecode or other goals. p  pI also noticed that the class files of the tests sometimes are put into the codeclassescode subdirectory instead of codetestclassescode.p  pI really cant figure out what is wrong.p  pThe JUnit java files are within codesrcmainjavacode and are correctly named codeTest.javacode. p  pDo I have to compile and run them always via Maven Why doesnt Eclipse compile the files when I want to run them Interestingly, emsometimesem it does. Sometimes everything works perfectly.p
Negative 321 pdear friends, i use openCV in Java. Everything is fine but the thing is that am limited with API, i cant create C files im not skilled in CC that much and i did not use them for a long time for my specific tasks, thus i must solve my problem with haar cascade xml file...p  pMy task is to detect simple objects NOT FACEs, just simple objects like cup on the table, clock on the wall...p  pI think it is possible with edge detecting, but i did not find any cascades for this simple detection stuff. It is quite hard for me to google it because when i search object detection it always gives face detection stuff... p  pCould you please suggest me solution for this Your help will be appreciated. Regards.p
Negative 321 pThe javadocs indicate that android.database.Cursor has a getTypeint method.  However, when I try to call this method, Eclipse gives me an error saying no method exists.   What givesp
Negative 321 pIm sorry if this is a duplicate question, but I cannot find an answer to this on here or elsewhere on the web.p  pIm busy rewriting an old project that was done in C, to C. p  pMy task is to rewrite the program so that it functions as close to the original as possible.p  pDuring a bunch of filehandling the previous developer who wrote this program creates a structure containing a ton of fields that correspond to the set format that a file has to be written in, so all that work is already done for me. p  pThese fields are all byte arrays. What the C code then does is use codememsetcode to set this entire structure to all spaces characters code0x20code. One line of code. Easy.p  pThis is very important as the utility that this file eventually goes to is expecting the file in this format. What Ive had to do is change this struct to a class in C, but I cannot find a way to easily initialize each of these byte arrays to all space characters.p  pWhat Ive ended up having to do is this in the class constructorp  precodeInitialize all of the variables to spaces. int index  0 foreach byte b in UserCode      UserCode[index]  0x20     index  codepre  pThis works fine, but Im sure there must be a simpler way to do this. When the array is set to codeUserCode  new byte[6]code in the constructor the byte array gets automatically initialized to the default null values. Is there no way that I can make it become all spaces upon declaration, so that when I call my class constructor that it is initialized straight away like this Or some codememsetcodelike function Thank you in advance.p

Negative 321 pWe have a web application running on Tomcat 7 and it loads a JNI library module that was coded in C and which was developped by a third party. Basically, this library provides biometric technology to our web app. We cannot use an all java solution for this and have no other choice than to use that JNI library module.p  pThe problem is that sometimes, the JNI library module crashes because it does a segmentation fault and corrupts memory. When that happens, it makes Tomcat crash completely without warning.p  pIs there a way to prevent tomcat from completely crashing when a loaded JNI library module crashes Ideally, when the JNI library module crashes, we would like to be notified and have a chance to reload the web appmodule.

Negative 321 pI am creating an application in Java that uses SQLite to store and search the data in a database.p  pI am not sure if I am approaching this problem in the most efficient way and I figured someone here could help me out with that.p  pstrongBackground infostrong My Java application parses .PDF files using a library that can transform the raw text from the PDF files to a StringWriter. I then parse the resulting data and get the info I need to create some new rows in my database. The resulting tables are very large, though, as there are about 900 PDF files to parse. Just to give you an idea of how large Im talking, one of the table ends up with about 145000 rows, another with 1550 rows, and the others 3 or 4 other tables with between 75 and 750 rows.p  pEverything works fine, but Im not sure if Icould lower the required time to create the tables and stuff. So far, on my laptop computer, it takes 41 minutes to create everything the first time through though everything runs from an USB flash drive... Ill test it on a HDD later. It takes 1.5 minutes when I run it again since it checks if the file has already been parsed and it doesnt recreate everything. I dont need it to be a HUGE improvement since ideally Id run this program only once a week with about 30 files or so, but still, Im wondering why it is so slow with 900 files if its the code that is parsing the files that is slow or if its bad practice on my end in the SQLite part. Im testing it with all the files created in the last year, which is why I have that many p  pSo, what are the best practices to improve performance with SQLite in Java Would it make a noticeable difference to put autocommit to false and to commit only once everything is created Is there a way to create statements or to test if data already exists in a more efficient mannerp  pI dont have my code with me, but the queries look kinda like thisp  precodepublic static void insertScoresString league, int playerID, int score, String date    PreparedStatement ps  new PreparedStatementINSERT INTO Scores,,,    ps.setString1, league   [...]   ps.executeUpdate  codepre  pOn other queries, I test to see if the row already exists using something like thisp  precodepublic static void insertScoresint playerID    ResultSet rs  null   PreparedStatement ps  new PreparedStatementSELECT  FROM Scores WHERE ID      ps.setInt1, playerID    rs  ps.executeQuery    ifrs.next         [code like in the first example]     codepre  pKeep in mind that syntax errors are because Im only typing this by heart since I dont have my code with me.p  pJust by seeing those examples and reading what I had to say, does anyone have any idea how to improve performance in my SQL statementsp

Negative 321 pI would like to use FORTRAN streaming IO to make a program that tells me how many lines a textfile has. The idea is to make something like thisp  precodeOPENUNIT10,ACCESSSTREAM,FILEtestfile.txt  nLines0 bContinue.TRUE.

ENDDO codepre  pI didnt include variable declaration but I think you get the idea of what they are the only important clarification would be that that cCharacter has LEN1p  pMy problem is that I dont know how to check if the character I just read from the file is an endofline or endoffile the ifs in the code. When you read and print characters this way, you eventually get newlines in the same place you had them in the original text, so I think it does read and recognize them as characters, somehow. Perhaps turning the characters into integers and comparing to the appropriate number Or is there a more direct wayp  pI know that you can use the register reading EDIT I meant record reading to do a program that reads lines more easily and add an IOstatus to check for eof, but the line counter is just a useful example, the idea is to learn how to move in a more controlled way through a textfilep

Negative 321 pId like to add a hrefhttpsgithub.combazhenovgroovyshellservergroovyshellservera to our application.  We have run into a couple production issues recently where a call to an internal API could have expedited diagnosis or even provided a shortterm fix.  Groovyshellserver provides a nice way to achieve this.p  pBut actually using this in production introduces a potential complication.  Lets say that, despite careful peer review, we execute a script which pegs the CPU, or gets stuck in an endless loop.  I need some way to kill that thread, pronto  So I was thinking about enhancing groovyshellserver to support an optional hard stop of a running Groovy client thread.p  pI know that a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase1.4.2docsguidemiscthreadPrimitiveDeprecation.htmlThread.stop is inherently unsafea its been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1283328arethreadstopandfriendseversafeinjavadiscussed on StackOverflow  beforea.

Negative 321 pI have got a question and I hope you can help me. My mac Applications is not a document based application, that means, you can have only one window open and you do not notice the saving of the data to a file in the library. But now, I want to import and export data. I found It was not that hard, and the importing and exporting works well. BUT Not good enough. When you see the exported file in finder, you see it as an unknown file. And if you try to open it, you get the message that no application, not even my app can open it. You have to click Import In the App. I want that you can see the file beeing part of my Application. And if you click it, the application should show up and ask you if you want to import. O googled for it and I searched the preferences, but I did not found anything. Can you help me Thanks Jannesp

Negative 321 pI am looking for the most simple way to pull out a line of data from a flat file database with PHP based on a variable ID number.p  pFor example, if the page is passed the ID of 10001 it grabs the first name, last name, company, address, and other demographic info of the user, etc.p  pThe database is a text file that has field names on the first line and the subsequent lines below contain the data. Its tab delimited and each line is separated by a carriage return.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p  pEdit The speed concern brought up by Eddie is definitely a valid one. So, to work around the need for PHP flat file database interaction I have instead used WebDNA to pull up the database data on the page prior to my PHP page. I then passed the data from the WebDNA page to the PHP page via form post. So there is 1 extra step in the payment process for the customer but the data is pulled up in a standard and quick way. p

Negative 321 pIve been banging my head against this for hours now, Im sure its something simple, but I just cant get a result.

Im testing for the first list and drawing coordinates decrementally from the size of the largest list. p  pThats badness because the two lists arent guaranteed equal lengths, thats a failure on my part for trying to rush an algorithm. p  pIn the picture, you cant see, but the little ellipse is actually a few blocks away from the big ellipse. This is caused when from ellipses not being drawn, which is caused by lists not having data. The actual little ellipse big ellipse is caused because the algorithm draws two octants, both of which are stored into the list from codegetSlice...code.p  pSo how can I fix this problem I havent implemented anything yet and probably wont for a while its early but this is what my brain cranked out. Again, this is not an answer to the question, just thoughts.p  pI iterate for codewhiles.isEmptycode and define two new values outside the loop codeincX  s.sizecode and codeincY  s1.sizecode I test to see if their z values match, if not, then I correct it. Im thinking Ill get the values, test the largest list and if they dont match then decrement the inc value of the smallest list by two and get the old values.p  pI test for codes.isEmptycode because the two lists will be empty at the same time. Also drawing ellipses, Ill use whichever one z value, because, again, they both should be equal.p  pIf thats wrong, then I guess I have this document I found to go through a hrefhttpwww.cs.sunysb.eduvislabwordpresspdf398.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cs.sunysb.eduvislabwordpresspdf398.pdfa.p

Negative 321 pIm trying to implement a multipass rendering method using OpenSceneGraph.  However, Im not entirely certain my problem is theoretical or due to a lack of applied knowledge of OSG.  Thus far, Ive successfully implemented multipass shading by rendering to a texture using an orthogonal projection, but I cannot seem to make a perspective projection work.p  pIt may be that I dont quite understand how to implement multipass shading.  Of course, I have to prerender the entire scene with the multipass shaders to a texture, then use the texture in the final render.  However, Im not talking about creating a separate texture for each object in the scene, but effectively capturing a screenshot of the entire prerendered scene.  Then, from that texture alone, applying the rendered effects to the individual geometries.p  pI assume this means I would have to do an extra conversion of the vertex coordinates for each geometry in the vertex shader.  That is, after computingp  precodeglPosition  ModelViewProjectionMatrix  Vertex codepre  pI would need to go a step further and calculate the vertexs screen coordinates in order to map the vertices correctly again, given that the texture consists of an entire screen shot of the scene.p  pIf I am correct, then I must be able to prerender the scene in a perspective view identical to the view used in the final render, rather than an orthogonal view.  This is where I have troubles.  I can make an orthogonal view do what I want, but not the perspective view.p  pAm I correct in my approach  The only other approach I can imagine is to render everything to a screenfilling quad in effect, the same thing as converting to screen coordinates, but that doesnt alleviate the need to use a perspective projection in the prerender stage.p  pThoughts  Linksp  pedit  I should also point out that in my successful attempts, I used a fragment shader only.  The perspective projection worked, but, of course, the screen aligned quad I was using was offset rather than centered.  I added a passthrough vertex shader and everything went blank.p

Negative 321 pThere can be many ways to do one task example to view some thing on jsp, JSTL or scriplets can be used some other classes or our own custom tag library . p  pBut the speed, performance, memory usage of the JSP page runs can be different. I believe that if the performance, the speed, time usage when a JSP page or servlet is called can be calculated or evaluated, the best way can be chosen among other ways. I wish to have a solution for Java EE applicationsjsp servelts, struts, spring, ejb, ...not to see the server performance    p  pSo any one let me know that a way to find those if it is possible.

Negative 321 pI am hoping someone can point my in the right direction here, because this error message makes absolutely no sense.

What makes matters even more frustrating, is this error will only show up for certain XML files. Other files that were serialized the same way and have the None value will deserialize without any issue. I have compared a working file to one that throws the error countless times, and the XML structure is the exact same. p  pBelow is a snippet from the serialized XML. p  precodeltKeygt0ltKeygt ltOptionTypegtNoneltOptionTypegt ltTypeIdgt0ltTypeIdgt codepre  pI suspect that there is a deeper problem, but the CLR is throwing a lying error instead of something useful. Can someone point me in the right direction toward finding out what the actual problem is, or if this is a valid error, explain to me why and what is wrong Also, for what it is worth, the deserialization happens in a C library. p  pThanks p

Negative 321 pBy default when creating NSManagedObject subclass file from data model, Core Data creates properties of type NSString nonatomic, retain for string type columns. I might be done due to performance consideration, however, Im implementing Data Mapper pattern where core data NSManagedObject subclasses are separated from  model classes. So when converting model classes to Core data NSManagedObject subclass, retain just assigns a pointer and not a copy. From the architecture point of view, it brakes logic separation between core data access and model classes, so I need to use copy instead of retain. p  pIs it the only way to do is manually to change properties in NSManagedObject subclasses p

Negative 321 pI lead a team of 4 PHP developers and we have been tasked with developing a custom social network siteportal. By social I mean Facebooklike social  activity streams, comments, popularity, various kinds of content, etc.  We dont have years to develop it from scratch so Im thinking about building on top of the existing CMS  either Wordpress with BuddyPress or Drupal. The choice between the two is a tough one for me. My team is very proficient in PHP but has no significant experience with neither of the CMSes. Both platforms provide similar enduser features but I wonder how easy it is to hack BuddyPress if we need to, which is very likely vs something likely Commons modules on Drupal.p  pThe problem with Drupal is that D7 is there but Commons modules havent been portedto it yet. Developing on D6 doesnt make a lot of sense to me as Ive read it will be problematic to migrate to D7 in the future.p  pThe social network site we have to develop is not really centered around a blog.

Negative 321 pI have a InvZone class in flash that extends sprite.  The idea is that this class  will create an array of Sprite children, compute and assign x,y,width and height properties to them and then addChild them in rows how many rows and children being specified in the arguments.p  pBoth the sprite invZone and its children invWindow are in the Flash library.  There they have symbols added to provide backgrounds and make sure their initial starting dimension are not 0.p  pMy problem is  the act of adding the children seems to be throwing out the height and width values of the InvZone instance.  I would expect that if the children in row and column totals somehow exceeded the initial dimensions of the InvZone, but my code should be preventing that unless I am totes codeblind on some issue.p  pHere is the class codep  precodepackage pnc.gui   import flash.display.Sprite import pnc.gui.InvWindow  public class InvZone extends Sprite       public const PADDINGXint  5     public const PADDINGYint  5       public var invWindowArray  new Array     public var invArray  new Array     private var windowsint     private var rowsint      public function InvZoneinputXint, inputYint, inputHeightint, inputWidthint, inputWindowsint, inputRowsint          normally these would set by args, but today well set them by hand         height  100         width  600         x0         y0         windows  16         rows  3          init             private function init          var windowsPerRowint  Math.ceilwindowsrows         var rowHeightNumber  height  2PADDINGYrows         var columnFullWidthNumber  width  2PADDINGXwindowsPerRow           for var i  0 iltwindows i              var currentRowint  Math.flooriwindowsPerRow             var invWindowInvWindow  new InvWindow             invWindowArray.pushinvWindow              invWindowArray[i].x  columnFullWidth  iwindowsPerRow  PADDINGX             traceXinvWindowArray[i].x              invWindowArray[i].y  rowHeight  currentRow  PADDINGY             traceYinvWindowArray[i].y              invWindowArray[i].height  rowHeight  PADDINGY             traceHEIGHTinvWindowArray[i].height              invWindowArray[i].width  columnFullWidth  PADDINGX             traceWIDTHinvWindowArray[i].width              trace ContainingSpriteHeight   height   rowHeight   rowHeight   currentRow   currentRow             if invWindowArray[i]                  addChildinvWindowArray[i]                                        codepre  pAnd here is the tracep  precode ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 0  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 0  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 0  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 0  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 0  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 0  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 1  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 1  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 1  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 1  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 1  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 1  ContainingSpriteHeight 100 rowHeight 30 currentRow 2  ContainingSpriteHeight 128.55 rowHeight 30 currentRow 2  ContainingSpriteHeight 128.55 rowHeight 30 currentRow 2  ContainingSpriteHeight 128.55 rowHeight 30 currentRow 2 codepre  pSo the last row is somehow pushing against the containing sprite  but I am at a loss as to how this happens.  Height is not the only value affected  the containing width can be blown out with different variables.  When this occurs, all the InvWindow sprites change size consistently but not the original background symbol from the library.  Ive tried shifting declarations and adding ADDEDTOSTAGE listeners, but there is no change. Can someone hit me with a clue stick, pleasep  pUPDATE To clarify I dont think the childrens edges should exceed the boundaries of the containing sprite  and so AFAIK it shouldnt expand at all. Sanchez has fixed the symptom, but whats the cause of the containing InvZone expanding and stretching the InvWindowsp  pstrongUPDATE2 with solutionstrong Acting on Sanchezs suggestion below to look to see what might be scaling  I realised the background sprite added to invZone in the library to give it a dimension was scaling in unexpected ways, breaking the boundaries.  By adding the background sprite in code rather than in the library, giving it the arguments for the class for h amp w and letting it define invZones dimensions, the problem went away.p

Negative 321 pIm using codeIDisposablecode along with codeCompositeDisposablecode to clean up my Reactive Extension Rx Observers in my ViewModels.p  pWhats the proper implementation for codeIDisposablecode in my ViewModels in this scenario  Typically, I wouldnt implement a finalizer since there arent unmanaged objects, but it seems that the finalizer might be useful to catch any missed calls to codeDisposecode and thus ensure that my Observers are always disposed.  My Observable is instantiated for the lifetime of the application, while the ViewModels are not.p  pThanksp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSome clarification The need for the call to Dispose is a little different in this case.  The Observer in Reactive Extensions uses Dispose to unsubscribe itself from the Observable.  In my case, I have a longlived Observer with many shortlived Observers and thus the Observers wont be GC unless explicitly Disposed due to the ObservableObserver reference.  Im completely new to Reactive Extensions, so I may be mistaken in my understanding.p

As I started I tested the build and it was fine to a point. Having entered all the files I now receiving errors like this when trying to build Resharper suggests all is finep  precodeThe type or namespace name Windows does not exist in the namespace Infrastructure.System are you missing an assembly reference CircularProgressBar.g.cs The type or namespace name Windows does not exist in the namespace Infrastructure.System are you missing an assembly reference CircularProgressBar.xaml The type or namespace name Delegate does not exist in the namespace Infrastructure.System are you missing an assembly reference  SearchView.g.cs The type or namespace name CodeDom does not exist in the namespace Infrastructure.System are you missing an assembly reference   CircularProgressBar.g.cs codepre  pThe common theme is that all files listed are XAML related. The Infrastructure project is WPF user controls one, all the xaml files have Build Action of Page.p  pNow the really weird bit. To try and identify where the issue arose I begun excluding folders from the project one by one. I started with InteractionRequests because Ive always had hassle here. No change. Then I excluded the next System and low and behold the solution builds and displays the main window. So, I started adding them back one by one  for example, if I add UserType back inp  precodenamespace Infrastructure.System    public enum TypeOfUser        User,     Admin           public enum TypeOfTrialUser        User,     Admin       public enum UserAccessStatus        Granted,     Revoked     codepre  pthe errors return. Exclude it again and theyre gone. Same story with other files as well so its nothing to do with the file itself as youd expect based on whats in it. When the errors return it still refers to the same list of xaml related files .xaml or .g.cs.p  pAny ideas I have to admit Im completely baffled by this Something to do with the file permissions maybe Wits end reached.....p
Negative 321 pHeres what I would like to achievep  blockquote   pAt the top of my page is a row of images.

Negative 321 pIn some class method, A, I need to call a library method B, which takes as an codeIProgressltObjectgtcode as a parameter.p  pNormally, I might  either implement codeIProgressltObjectgtcode as part of class where A resides, and then pass this to method B. Or perhaps I might create a new class whose only purpose is to implement codeIProgressltObjectgtcode and handle it correctly then in this case Id create an instance of that class and pass it to B.p  pBut what I really want is to have my implementation of codeIProgressltObjectgtcode to appear right inside the method in which Im calling B, so that theres less of a visual disconnect between the calling code, and the codeIProgressltObjectgtcode implementation.  I consider my implementation of IProgress to be kind of a private, nonshared detail of the calling method and thus I dont want my implementation of codeIProgressltObjectgtcode to be in a whole separate method of perhaps a whole other class.p  pWhat Ive been trying to do is use a lambda in which I will define my short progress handling, and then somehow pass this lambda to B, like thisp  precodemethod in class A  ...

Negative 321 pHow can you use stringstream to tokenize a line that looks like this.p  p[label] opcode [arg1] [,arg2]p  pThe label may not always be there but if it isnt, there will be a white space. The opcode is always there and there is a space or tab in between opcode and arg1. Then there is no whitespace in between arg1 and arg2 but it is split by a comma.p  pAlso, some blank lines will have white space on them so they need to be discarded.  is a commentp  pSo for instancep  precodeSample Input TOP  NoP      L   2,1 VAL  INT  0 codepre  pThis is just an example of the text file Ill be reading in from.

Thats why I wanna ask you guys your opinion on this matter. p  pThanks in advance. Joanp

Negative 321 pI have written a custom data model to be displayed with several QTableViews.p  pTechnically, everything works fine my views show the changes made from my model.

Negative 321 pI am using the Data Mapper Pattern and I am wondering what is the best way to handle relationships with that pattern. I spent a lot of time searching for solutions in Google and Stack overflow, I found some but I am still not completely happy about them, especially in one special case that I will try to explain.p  pI am working with PHP so the examples of code that I will put are in PHP.p  pLets say I have a table team id, name and a table player id, name, teamid. This is a 1N relationship. By implementing the Data Mapper pattern, we will have the following classes Team, TeamMapper, Player and PlayerMapper.p  pSo far, everything is simple. What if we want to get all players from a teamp  pThe first solution I found is to create a method getAllPlayers in the Team class which will handle that with lazy loading and proxies. Then, we can retrieve the players of a team like thatp  precodeplayers  teamgtgetAllPlayers codepre  pThe second solution I found is to directly use the PlayerMapper and pass the team ID as parameter. Something likep  precodeplayerMappergtfindAllarrayteamid gt teamgtgetId codepre  pBut now, lets say that I want to display a HTML table with all the teams and with a column Players with all of the players of each team. If we use the first solution I described, we will have to do one SQL query to get the list of teams and one query for each team to get the players, whcih means N1 SQL queries where N is the number of teams.p  pIf we use the second solutions I described, we can first retrieve all team IDs, put them in an array, and then pass it to the findAll method of the player mapper, something like thatp  precodeplayerMappergtfindAllarrayteamid gt teamIds codepre  pIn that case, we need to run only 2 queries. Much better. But I am still not very happy with that solution because the relationships are not described into the models and it is the developer who must know about them.p  pSo my question is are there others alternatives with the Data Mapper pattern With the example I gave, is there a good way to select all teams with all players in just 2 queries with the description of the relationships into the modelp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 321 pI have an econtent adapter that is essentially causing the refresh of numerous tables. While it is theoretically possible to filter all notifications down to the exact notifications that should cause a refresh on the tables, it would be extraordinarily difficult and timeconsuming as we have a massive model, and many different events and changes that could possibly trigger a refresh. Also, what often happens is a single userevent like clicking statenew in our application, triggers 4 objects being created behind the scenes, all of which look very similar from the notification standpoint and therefore makes it difficult to filter out. Im wondering if there is a good way to do some sort of delayed job so that the 4 notifications only cause a single refresh. For example, something similar top  precodepublic void notifyChangedfinal Notification notification      super.notifyChangednotification      Override      public void run           ifmatchesFiltersnotification              some sort of check to see if we recently had another event that would have triggered a refresh            ifschedulingJob                scheduleDelayedJob                                 codepre  pUnfortunately I have little experience in jobs and things like that, so it would be very helpful if someone could give assistance in what the proper way of doing this is.p  pas another example, if someone just hits controlN 20 times in our application very rapidly, it will rapidly create 20 new states, and we would just want to update the UI at the end of those 20 notifications, not refresh 20 times.p

Negative 321 pConsider a class which has some kind of lifetime. During this lifetime, an event may occur any number of times and the event is signaled through completion of a task which is renewed after an event.

It may as well live forever.p  pNow consider some kind of asynchronous workflow modelling the lifecycle of the objectp  precodewill be completed on Shutdown.

Or are they Will continuations be unregistered or will the app eventually blow up Is there a cleaner pattern to model such a control flowp

Negative 321 pIm using a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialconcurrencyforkjoin.html relnofollowJavas forkjoin frameworka to deal with a CPU intensive calculation.p  pIve tweaked the sequential threshold used to determine whether to create subtasks or do the work a bit, but to my disappointment, going from singlethreaded to 44 cores only about doubles the overall performance. The pool does report 8 CPUs, and when I manually set 2,3,4,.. I see gradual increases in performance, but still it tops out at about twice the single thread throughput overall. Also, the Linux System Activity monitor hovers around 50 for that Java process.p  pAlso very suspicious is the fact that when I start multiple Java processes, the collective throughput is more in line almost 4 times faster than a single thread and the System Activity monitor shows higher CPU use.p  pIs is possible that there is a limitation in either Java, Linux, or the forkjoin framework that would disallow full CPU usage Any suggestions or similar experiencesp  pNB.

Negative 321 pMy situation is a PHP script that has HTML select tags.  When the onchange from the select happens it can fire off up to 15 javascript functions, each slightly different.

Negative 321 pive got a strange problem with using WNetAddConnection2. First of all i connect to a WebDAV folder with correct server name, user name and password. Connection get established as expected and i can see the mounted drive with the windows explorer.p  pAfter that i call WNetCancelConnection2 to remove the mounted drive. Works fine and it disappears from the explorer.p  pNow there comes the strange behaviour. If i try to connect again to the server it does not matter what password i use, i can take a totally wrong one and the drive get mounted again without any problems. Seems that Windows caches the connection.p  pI found out that it takes exactly one minute and after that time trying to connect will bring up the expected error message.p  pMy question is if this 60 seconds timeframe is adjustable or what other thing i can do to avoid this behaviour.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 321 pLets say I have four comboboxes lets call the cbA1, cbA2, cbB1, cbB2, cbA1 and cbB1 are bound to the same property and cbA2 and cbB2 to a different property in my viewmodel. Before I switched over to MVVM I had some codebehind that made sure the same value wasnt the same in cbA1 and cbB1. They use an enum as the itemssource.p  pYoull have to ignore the reasons why I have this many comboboxes displaying the data as it is for now. I only stumbled on this accidentally.p  pThis is how they are constructed in XAMLp  precodeltComboBox      xNamecbA1     DisplayMemberPathDescription      SelectedValuePathValue      SelectedValueBinding Window1Page      ItemsSourceBinding SourcelocalEnumeration xType EnumeDisplayPagesgt   ltComboBox      xNamecbA2     DisplayMemberPathDescription      SelectedValuePathValue      SelectedValueBinding Window2Page      ItemsSourceBinding SourcelocalEnumeration xType EnumeDisplayPagesgt codepre  pSo when I run the app the 1 comboboxes display the data from Window1Page and the 2 comboboxes display the data from Window2Page. My old codebehind checked to make sure that what was in the 1 comboboxes couldnt be in 2 comboboxes. This worked a treat. Now Im moving to the MVVM model Ive moved the code to do the check into the property itself. Here is one of the propertiesp  precode    public eDisplayPages Window1Page              get  return window1page          set                      if window1page  value                 return              if value.Equalswindow2page ampamp value  eDisplayPages.NoDashPage                              Cant have them both selecting the same page                 value  eDisplayPages.NoDashPage                           SetPropertyref window1page, value               codepre  pAlthough not really pertinent here is the enum to help you visualise the issuep  precodepublic enum eDisplayPages      [DescriptionNO Layout]     NoDashPage  0,     [DescriptionMain Layout]     MainDashPage,     [DescriptionTiming Layout]     TimingOnlyDashPage  codepre  pSo the issue Im seeing is that when I change lets say cbA1 to the same value as cbA2 the property code runs and changes the value to the default NoDashPage, but it only updates the combobox that I didnt make the change in, in this case cbB1.p  pThe old codebehind method used to change the combobox I was focused on as well as the other combobox. The only difference there was that I used to set the SelectedValue of the focused combobox to the new value, which did update the other combobox.p  pI dont understand why it doesnt then change the combobox I made the initial selection in. If I go into the debugger the value of Window1Page is correct. p  pWhilst Ill eventually remove the duplicate comboboxes the fact the one I have focus on isnt updating is the biggest issue.p

Negative 321 pIn order to add more tools to my Python arsenal, Ive started work on a pet project  a personal time management app, a hrefhttpsgithub.comegasimusthyme relnofollow titleThymeThymea.p  pCurrently, the app consists of two processes Every 500ms, a separate process gets the focused window via codewin32uicode, and writes it into a SQLite DB via SQLAlchemy while the main process launches a CherryPy web server which handles the apps UI.p  pHowever, the two Python processes have a total memory footprint of about 30MB, which I would like to reduce. I know that one way to do this is to use multithreading  but I really cant tell if its even worth opening that can of worms. Would my use case be appropriate for the multithreaded approachp

Using PasswordDeriveBytes object we are first getting 32 bytes for the Key            the default Rijndael key length is 256bit  32bytes and then 16 bytes for the IV.            IV should always be the block size, which is by default 16 bytes 128 bit for Rijndael.            If you are using DESTripleDESRC2 the block size is 8 bytes and so should be the IV size.            You can also read KeySizeBlockSize properties off the algorithm to find out the sizes.           byte[] encryptedData  EncryptclearBytes, pdb.GetBytes32, pdb.GetBytes16             Now we need to turn the resulting byte array into a string.

Negative 321 pI have been doing a lot of research about static objects and the high vs low frequency heap.  I understand that the high frequency heap is not garbage collected.

Is the dictionary there too  Or maybe is there a pointer to the low frequency heapbr When creating a dictionaryarray of default size and adding the values one at a time, the dictionary has to resize itself repeatedly.  As I understand it, it does this by allocating new memory and copying over the data, and the old dictionary gets Garbage Collected eventually.  But if the High frequency heap is not collected, would this cause multiple copies of the array to reside in the HF heap  Or if the HF heap has only pointers to the LF heap, do they not get collected because there are references residing in HF heap stillp  pEdit Thanks  Alexei Levenkov, this is currently running on the web and we are getting really unusual out of memory exceptions killing our server when this GetEnum is called.

Negative 321 pIm developing my first application in ObjectiveC, so I fully expect it to be not quite best practice at this point but I think I may be starting to scatter my codeoutletsactions in the wrong places.

Heres a brief outline of my appp  pI have an NSTabView at the top containing some NSTextFields and NSButtons, so I have what Ive called a TabViewController with all the outletsactions for anything inside it. Through code I now want to be able to set the default action for the text fields to be one of two buttons so I cant wire it up by ctrldragging, one assumes. I thought Id do this in my TabViewControllers init method but this doesnt seem to work, so I guess its not being called as I would have hopedp  precode[myTextFieldOutlet setTargetself]  [myTextFieldOutlet setActionselectoroneOfTheMethods] codepre  pSo, I was about to drag some outlets to my AppDelegate thinking I should do the above from within the applicationDidFinishLaunching method, but this would now require outlets for these text fields in two files, and not just the TabViewController. Im now starting to think Im creating a mess. Presumably self wouldnt be right if I did the above within AppDelegate and perhaps oneOfTheMethods couldnt be seen, either I havent tried that yet.p  pIs there a better way to do this I wanted to get away from having a hundred methods in one class and having a controller for each of the main containers in the GUI seemed reasonable enough. But when methods in one controller need to refer to other controllers then Im beginning to think Im doing it wrong. Im much more familiar with c .NET and would easily get the same thing done there without a problem, but ObjectiveC and XCode still have me secondguessing myself most of the time.p  pThanks.p

Negative 321 pI often find that people stress using variable names that appropriately and accurately describe what the variable is trying to convey.  This is also often very hard to do in a word or two.  I find it true that though longer names are typically more accepted, they often lead to code that is even less readable because of mere clutter.  I find that once I understand what a variable conveys, the name is merely an alias for that understanding, and that the name itself does not necessarily make a difference.  In that case, I would personally almost always prefer shorter names to longer ones.p  pIs it ever appropriate to use short variable names  Is it acceptable to use names that arent necessarily understood without looking at the rest of the algorithm or class, but perhaps which are commented at declaration of the variable or beginning of the algorithm  Or is it generally always preferable to have longer names that immediately and definitively convey meaningp

With nesting and more branching, this becomes a performance problem. p  h3Edge casesh3  pThe location encompasses the entire range of consumed inputp  precodevar c  nodenextchar , charC, buildNodeC codepre  pA C nodes location starts at the start of the space character.p  precodevar d  nodebetweenchar, char, charD, buildNodeD codepre  pA D nodes location starts at the start of  and ends at the end of . Both of these cases are correctly handled by codenodecode.p  h1Questionh1  pHow can I refactor these parsers to fail quickly but still access the correct location datap  pI would prefer to keep each parser fairly self contained and avoid repeating logic. Additionally, the nodes must not be modified after construction.p

Negative 321 pSo I installed a local NuGet server using the NuGet.Server package and VS2012.  Everything seems to work fine, I have a package that I created based on a web application.  The server knows about the package i.e. I can list it using nuget list, but when I try to install it on the target machine, I get an InvalidDataException with a message the the Archive file cannot be size 0.p  pI am using Win7 x86 and the commandline nuget.exe utility from within PowerShell.  Nuget.exe is in windows.p  pAlso, I can install packages from the public nuget.org server on this target machine.p  pIn an interesting twist, I am able to install the very same internal package from the very same internal server when I run the same command from within the Package Manager Console in VS2012.  I have verified that the nuget.exe versions are the same.p  pAny help on thisp  pThanks, Matthewp

Negative 321 pI am trying to resolve the following problem via PHP. The aim is to generate a unique 6character string based on an integer seed and containing a predefined range of characters.  The second requirement is that the string must appear random so if code 1 were 100000, it is not acceptable for code 2 to be 100001, and 3 100002p  pThe range of characters isp  ul liUppercase AZ excluding B, I, O, S and Z li li09 excluding 0, 1, 2, 5, 8li ul  pSo that would be a total of 26 characters if I am not mistaken. My first idea would to be encoding from base 10 to base 24 starting at number 7962624. So do 7962624  seed, and then base24 encode that number.p  pThis gives me the characters 0N.  If I replace the resulting string in the following fashion, I then meet the first criteriap  precodeBP, IQ, 0R, 1T, 2U, 5V, 8W codepre  pSo at this point, my codes will look something like thisp  precode1TRRRR, 2TRRRT, 3TRRRU codepre  pSo my question to you gurus is strongemHow can I make a method that behaves consistently so the return string for a given integer is always the same and meets the 2 requirements aboveemstrong I have spent 2 full days on this now and short of dumping 700,000,000 codes into a database and retrieving them randomly Im all out of ideas.p  pStephenp
Negative 321 pI am c developer working on a Word Press site.  I am used to the Visual Studio experience of opening the project, working on it, then pressing run to see your site and debug it.p  pI am having a hard time trying to get a similar experience with WordPress.  For example, I have tried both VS plugs for PHP.  They both work great for new PHP projects, but with a fresh copy of the latest wordpress, the both break.  In one, it just gives an error message, the other says that the MySQL Plugin is not enabled. Yes, MySQL is installed and I can successfully host WordPress with MySQL through IIS.   Dispite messages on both forums, I have not been able to resolve.p  pSo the question is what is a good editor, free or paid for working with wordpress sites Just something that works. Like have you actually used one successfully with WordPress  My latest attempt is with PHP Storm which looks really good, but am still struggling with the learning curve of a new IDE.  I would really like to be able to stay with VS if possible, as I like the Source Control.p

Negative 321 pI first saw a colleague do this when he implemented object pools. He passed the class that was going to be pooled as a parameter to a generic base class. This base class layed out the pooling code.p  pThe odd thing is that the base class will know of its children. This is considered bad practice in every normal case. But in this case the parent is just a technical solution to avoid writing repetetive code. The base class is never referenced by any other code.p  pOne drawback with this construction is that it burns the base class. You cannot introduce the generic base class in the middle of a hierarchy. This problem might be outside the topic.p  pBelow is a thinkable examplep  precodepublic abstract class SingletonltTgt where T  class      public static T Instance  get private set       public Singleton              if Instance  null             throw new ExceptionSingleton instance already created.

They need to be public static variables so I can look them up from somewhere else in the core when all Ive got there is the type of weapon that was fired.p  pIs this how I should be trying to do it How does the Weapon superclass access these variables p

Negative 321 pRight now, I have a program that works like this.  An old legacy system puts a row into a database.  That row is status 0.  I have a Windows Console application in .Net that checks the DB ever 5 seconds, and sends a printing command to a printer.p  pThis architecture is really chewing up a ton of resources on the computer where the console app runs. Essentially, there are a TON of empty commands that get run. Only once in a while is a printing command put into the DB. However, as soon as the DB gets the printing command the program needs to process it ASAP.p  pAny suggestions on how to make this work better I think an ondemand thing might be better  IE the legacy system sending some kind of signal right to my program. Not sure how to accomplish this.p  pAny help would be AWESOME.p

Negative 321 pIn a new sql server report 2012 ssrs 2012, I have a dashboard report where users export various pages to excel. The users want to be able to sort the data on their excel spreadsheets. However they are getting an error message about merged cells.p  pTo svolve the problem so far, I have changed some test ssrs 20012 reports where there are no report headers. The only type of headers the reports have are column headers. When there are only columns headers, I can export the reports to excel and sort all the data columns.p  pWhat I have removed in the test ssrs 2012 reports is the report header that is the same width as the detail lines of the reports.

Negative 321 pSo, cisco routers a hrefhttpwww.cisco.comenUSproductsswsecurswps1018productstechnote09186a00800a5b9a.shtmltopic2 relnofollowallowa one to specify ACLs using what are called wildcard masks. Wildcard masks specify a group of hosts using a 32bit long integer, but they differ from the typical netmask in that when a bit is 0 in wildcard mask, it represents a compulsory match and when it is 1, then it is a wildcard. Some folks even cisco call it inverse mask, and the fact is that all netmasks can be coverted into wildcard masks by simple inversion, but not the other way around. Because you can have wildcard mask that can look like thisp  p0.0.255.0 0.0.255.254 0.255.0.254 and so on.p  pwhich really has no equivalent netmasksp  pWhat I want to do and hope that somebody has already done something like this, is to convert a generic wildcard into a collection of equivalent CIDR blocks. It would be very nice if the solution is in Python i.e. the output generates the infamous netaddr IPNetwork objects, but if you really just have an efficient algorithm to solve this, I would take it.p

Negative 321 pA client has asked us to create an app for iOS that gifts other apps to their customers. I.e. a customer downloads the app, in which some paid App Store app are offered for free. The fee is paid by our client.p  pEssentially, it should work pretty much like Apples 12 days of Christmas app.p  pI cant find any way to achieve this.

Negative 321 pIm writing a python script to crack a playfair cipher, with only the ciphertext. First i generate about 30100 decryption keys and run them on the ciphertext, ranking each one on its digraph frequencies. To the next generationiteration I copy the ones with the best score. Then they are mutated letters swapped places in the 5x5 grid  and readd to the next iteration, which is ranked again, and so on.p  pIve noticed that the script often finds a local maximum  a key giving a similar distribution, yet not the real deal. I think a solution to the problem would be to introduce more variation to the population of keys by the end of the script, all of them are almost the  same.p  pI tried to implement it by adding to each generation a couple totally random keys but they get eliminated almost immediately.

Negative 321 pIm trying to write a pluginlike function in jQuery to add elements to a container with AJAX. It looks like thisp  precode.fn.cacheload  functionindex      var this  this     .getcache.php,  id index .donefunctiondata           cache.php returns ltdiv classentrygtContentltdivgt ...         data.insertAfterthis.last       codepre  pand I would like to use it like thisp  precodevar entries  div.entry,     id  28  entries.cacheloadid codepre  pThink that this would load another entrycontainer and add it to the DOM.p  pThis is works so far. But of course the variable that holds the cached jQuery object codeentriescode isnt updated. So if there were two divs in the beginning and you would add another with this function it would show in the DOM, but codeentriescode would still reference the original two divs only.p  pI know you cant use the return value of get because the AJAXcall is asynchronous. But is there any way to update the cached object so it contains the elements loaded via AJAX as wellp  pI know I could do it like this and requery after insertingp  precode    .getcache.php,  id num .donefunctiondata          data.insertAfterthis.last         entries  div.entry      codepre  pbut for this I would have to reference the variable holding the cached objects directly. Is there any way around this so the function is selfcontained I tried reassigning codethiscode, but got an error. code.addcode doesnt update the cached object, it creates a new temporary object. p  pThanks a lotp  p UPDATEp  pJohn S gave a really good answer below. However, I ended up realizing that for me something else would actually work better. Now the plugin function inserts a blank element synchronously and when the AJAX call is complete the attributes of that element are updated. That also ensures that elements are loaded in the correct order. For anyone stumbling over this, here is a JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJZsLt2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netJZsLt2ap

In doing so, you can see that the initial markups wont follow the image i.e. if you underline Sample Text to Underline and then hit resize, the underlined portion is no longer underlined. Now, I know how to resize the canvas when this happens, but I dont know how to make it so the markups follow it. I did see somewhere that I could just take the markup convert it to the data64 encoding and possibly scale that down. The problem is that it doesnt scale back up very well pixelated. p  pAlso, the user should still be able to make markups after zooming inout. So, is there a good way of doing this I heard of scaling the image but then I run into issues on continuing to markup the document after resizing it mouse is offset from the markup.

So I do thisp  precodesubroutine funcwithea,b,c,d,e  Declare a,b,c,d,e   compute values  return end  subroutine funca,b,c,d  Declare a,b,c,d double precision elength   fill e with dummy values  call funcwithea,b,c,d,e  return end codepre  pThe way I wrote this codeecode is always used unlike the C codeNULLcode pointer example, but I could always add a second argument to flag whether to use codeecode or not. The existing code base calls the function codefunccode, and when I want to use codeecode I use codefuncwithecode.p  pIs this a viable strategy Can anyone speak from experience if this enhances or degrades maintainability Its quite inconvenient to not have default values, but it is obviously inconvenient to go through this nonsense too. Is there any way I can get this behavior to happen at compile time rather than runtime Note that I cant use any Fortran 90 or higher functionality.p  pEDIT Thanks for the responses everyone. I have decided against ENTRY because it is just too unclear.p  pMy only concern is the longterm viability of this approach. What if one of these functions gets 1020 different signatures. Every single one would have to be updated, and the chance for error increases. I guess that is life though.p

Negative 321 pI have the official Navigation Drawer in my app. Clicking items in the drawer opens new Fragments in the content part of the screen. Every Fragment contains codeFrameLayoutcode with the same id which is used for displaying a Crouton. p  pBasic use is that an infinite Crouton is shown when user clicks refresh button in Action Bar notifying about ongoing refresh. After refresh is finished, another crouton is shown replacing the old one. In some cases Croutons are shown even right after a screen is entered and replaced when refresh is triggered.p  pThe issue Im experiencing is a bit difficult to describe. Some Croutons are just not showing from time to time. It usually happens when I switch between screens the initial Crouton is not shown or the Crouton is not shown when I press refresh button for the first time on that screen  however, it strongisstrong displayed when refresh finishes and when I press refresh button afterwards. p  pSo it is pretty unpredictable.

Negative 321 pIve recently started learning Reflection.Emit, so I could replace all the Activator usages for better performance in my code. Im currently thinking about some kind of serialization and deserialization library. Especially for deserialization Id like to recreate the state of object exactly the same, as it was before serialization I assume serialization is 100 correct. However, e.g. there can be class, that have multiple constructors, and every one does something sophisticated, because this object has complicated logic and has to be initialized some specific way. But when I have serialized everything about the object, the simplest thing I could do is somehow bypass any of the provided ctors  just make an empty object and fill its all fields with data. Period.p  pUnfortunately, usage of codeOpCodes.Newobjcode in codeILGenerator.Emitcode requires passing codeConstructorInfocode as parameter. For structs it would be easy, as they always have default parameterless ctor. However with classes things are different.p  pI would appreciate any help.p

Negative 321 pI have the following data formatted with the help of tags i.e. not a full compliant XML because its missing XML declarationp  precodeltTAG1gttestltTAG1gt ltTAG2gtanotherltinnergttagltTAG2gt codepre  pThe above is exactly what I send to Jsoup to parse. As you see, there is a codeltinnergtcode tag inside and this is expected. Its also expected this codeltinnergtcode tag wont have a closure tag in fact its just a placeholder for something else  and I cant change this design. The problem is that right after sending this XML to codeparsecode method, Jsoup is automatically creating the codeltinnergtcode tag, therefore messing up the original content.p  pIs there a way to Jsoup consider only the tags that were fully opened and closed In this case, codeTAG1code should have content codetestcode and codeTAG2code should have content codeanotherltinnergttagcode. This is the result I need. Regular XML parsers wont work because my data is not a full XML, but in fact just data organized by tags.p  pThanksp

Negative 321 pThe application compiles and runs with no compiler errors however no Q logo is displayed. I have taken the QT Logo OpenGL example a hrefhttpqt.developpez.comdoc4.7openglhellogl relnofollowhttpqt.developpez.comdoc4.7openglhellogla and attempted to compile in QT version 5.2.1 MSVC 2010, 32bit . I am aware that there is a change in the way OpenGL is used in version 5 from the older version 4. I have modified some of the code from a working GL example and it still does not work. My bet is the problem exists in the QtLogo because I have changed nothing in those files. So I am completely puzzled being a newbie to OpenGL. I hope to have provided a descent problem statement. Answering this will help so many others unlock the mysteries of QT OpenGL changes. It is so frustrating.p  p1 QT version 5.2.1 MSVC 2010, 32bit  Installed with Qt 5.2.1 for Windows 32bit MinGW 4.8, OpenGL, 634 MB installer 2 Windows 7, tried 32bit and 64bit 3 Intel CPUs used two

Negative 321 pIn my view, I have two divs, one responsible for adding an entry to my database, and one responsible for showing all of my database table rows when the page loads.  The div responsible for displaying the contents of my table uses the Datatables jQuery plugin, which makes my life easier as far as displaying this content goes.p  pBoth of these divs work just fine, separately.  However, I would like to integrate them together such that when I add an entry using my first div, the database is updated, and this entry is then appended to my Datatable in my second div, without reloading the entire page.p  pIm aware that this process alone is easy enough using the Datatables API, simply by using the row.add and draw functions, this can be done, and is demonstrated a hrefhttpwww.datatables.netexamplesapiaddrow.html relnofollowherea.p  pWhile this is a potential solution, Im not completely satisfied with it, because the rest of my page utilizes jQuerys slideDown for neatlooking animations, and I was hoping that I could apply this animation to adding another row to my Datatable.  If you look at their example, it simply inserts the row, but it would look better if I could make that row slide down from the table.p  pIs this something that could be done without spending too much time on it  Or should I just stick with using the Datatables API and give up on trying to animate it  Ive already tried using jQuery to append a new row manually, but it looks terrible because I dont think I can reload the plugin to adopt the change into the Datatable.p  pCould someone please point me in the right direction  Thanksp

Later I will need to perform some operations on these curves, so visualizing them could be really useful.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPwYfB.png altenter image description herep  pAnother interesting thing that I noticed initially when drawing the contours themselves is that if I used cv2.drawContours passing in all the contours codecv2.drawContoursimg3,contour,1,0,0,200,1code I got a solid tracing of the shape, as well as the outside border of the frame img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comD4Y3l.png altenter image description herep  pOn the other hand, if I chose the contour representing the shape itself not the outside border of the frame codecv2.drawContoursimg3,contour[0],1,0,0,200,1code, I got more of a dotted tracing as output img srchttpi.stack.imgur.cometeKS.png altenter image description herep  pI guess I dont have a complete handle on what the drawContours function is doing here.p

Negative 321 pIm knee deep in a multiplayer game and found out Im doing some frownedupon actions with MySQL Im a beginner with databasing and PHP.p  pIve got a table of users with all their pertinent information and a table for games with most of their relevant information. My problem is that Im dynamically creating a table for each game containing a user id, their score, and other gamespecific data. I know thats bad practice, so Im looking to merge that with the single entry in my games table, but I cant figure out how to do it because of a few issuesp  ul liEach game can have 36 players, so I think Id have to assume the max and just not fill the entriesli liPlayers should be able to enter multiple games, so just having an activegame column in the users table wouldnt workli ul  pIve been looking for resources, but the best I could find is that its also bad practice to include a pseudoarray in a column. Meaning if I did have an activegames column, it wouldnt be best practice to have the data be a CSV of all currently active gameids.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 321 pIm trying to work out how to select X number of unique values from one given column in the result from an SQL query with multiple joins which produces some duplication that requires filtering back down post query once the X number of unique values have been found. p  pA simple example might be a result containing a one to many relationship of user ids and the names of countries they have visited.p  pSo it might take 40, 60 or 6000 rows of results to get 10 individual people, but 10 is the required parameter in the query, and the actual number of rows to return is whatever it takes to achieve that number of unique people.p  pIf its not too much info, I thought I would reference my real PHPMYSQL example. p  pIn this example, I am selecting, say 10 USERIDs at a time from a query to find users best matched by their distance from a given point, then by the weighting of any instrument they play, then by the weighting of any styles that they play. The weighting of styles and instruments indicates each members interest or skill level, where 1 is their favourite or best. p  pBecause the style and instrument weightings are integral to the order of the results, I think I need to run one biq query with multiple joins, to get everything in the right order of preference for results.  As opposed to just searching by distance and then looping through those results in another query looking at joining up the instruments and styles info.p  pSome relevant tables and their columns.p  pstrongmembersstrongp  precodeUSERID  PASSWORD FIRSTNAME   LASTNAME            BIO          BIOIMAGE        WILLCONNECTSTATUS  PROFILECOMPLETE     EMAIL                    SIGNUPDATE                  LASTLOGIN               ACCOUNTTYPE     EMAILACTIVATED      NOTIFYMSG  int11      NOTIFYCONNREQ  NOTIFYPROFCHANGE   LATITUDE     LONGTITUDE codepre  pstrongmembersinststrongp  precodeID USERID INSTRUMENTID ACTIVE WEIGHT codepre  pstronginstrumentsstrongp  precodeid name active codepre  pstrongmembersstylesstrongp  precodeID USERID STYLEID ACTIVE WEIGHT codepre  pstrongstylesstrongp  precodeid style active codepre  pHeres a test query as I have it so far.

Negative 321 pIts my first time trying out Elastic Beanstalk, up until now Ive had a nodeexpress app manually set up and running on a single ec2 instance.p  pIm using the console web ui to upload a zip of my node app, everything appears successful in the console and the monitoring health is constantly greenhealthy, but when I got to the url elastic beanstalk provides httpmy app.elasticbeanstalk.com I expected to get to the root page of my nodeexpress app but instead the response is just a number 2.p  pAnyone know how I can debug this I have taken a look at the snapshot logs and things seem fine there too, the node app has logged out that it has started and is listening and there are no errors. Earlier I had a problem where I had a nginx bad gateway but that was because I was listening on the wrong port, that was fixed.p  pI can ssh into the ec2 instance if that would help but not sure really how to debug elastic beanstalk issues, Im used to just deploying things myselfp

Negative 321 pWhile developing the mobile navigation menu for a site I am redesigning, I discovered that a number of mobile browsers trigger the CSS hover event through a tap, including Chrome, FlashFox, and the default browser on Android 4.x, as well as Safari on iOS 7. Is this behavior wide spread enough to rely on Im assuming issues might arise with Android 2.x phones.p  pIm wondering if anyones had any experience with this and if this behavior is safe to rely on for my navigation menu. Also is there any kind of spec that defines this behavior, or did it just kind of appear From what Ive seen it appears to perform pretty uniformly across devices.p  pIve done mobile navigation menus before with JavaScript, but this would be a nice alternative.p  pI know there are a couple questions that deal with this topic on stackoverflow, but they are pretty old, and I couldnt find any question dealing specifically with what I wanted to know.p  pEDIT To clarify, the site is being developed with responsive design, and Im not simply trying to use the desktop style navigation bar with hover. The menu is formatted for mobile, and the hover would replace the need to write JavaScript to reveal submenus when a menu option is tapped.p
Negative 321 pIm working on a game. The games code is almost entirely in a PlayScene.swift file. However, since I need to recognize pan gestures, I had to put a UIPanGestureRecognizer to my ViewController.swift. As the player drags the screen, I would like to rotate a SpriteNode that is declared and used in the PlayScene.swift. The name of this spriteNode is Tommy, but when I do codePlayScene.rotateTommyLeftcode from the ViewController which is a custom function of mine located in PlayScene.swift, the function rotateTommyLeft is called, but it doesnt rotate the same sprite that is currently running. It creates a new instance of class PlayScene, creates new SpriteNode tommy and instead rotates that one.p  pHow can I access the SpriteNode tommy from the PlaySceen that is currently runningp  pEdit Im posting the parts of code so we can solve out problem regarding storing the scene and transferring it between other classes.p  pAt the top of my GameScene class, I declared variable storedPlayScene to store the scene in which the gaming occurs.p  pcodevar storedPlayScene  PlayScenecodep  pthen, I create the scene and present it when play button is pressed also in GameScene classp  precodevar scene  PlayScenesize self.size                 let skView  self.view as SKView                 skView.ignoresSiblingOrder  true                 scene.scaleMode  .ResizeFill                 scene.size  skView.bounds.size                 scene.backgroundColor  UIColorred 106255.0, green 180255.0, blue 1.0, alpha 1.0                  storedPlayScene  scene                  skView.presentScenescene codepre  pNow the surprising part occurs when I try to obtain two variables belonging to PlayScene class, from the ViewController class.p  pWhen I write this in the ViewController classp  pcodevar rotation  GameScene.getStoredPlayScene.tommy.zRotationcode I obtain the correct zRotation.

Negative 321 pWhen defining a new reference class in R there is a bunch of boilerplate methods that are expected by R conventions, such as codelengthcode, codeshowcode etc. When these are defined they aggressively masks similar named methodsfunctions when called from within the class methods.

for to read the arrays but then afther a google search Ive found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12853121howtocomparetwoarraylistsforsimilarobjectswhichdifferinatleastoneTHIS LINKa and then Ive tried to use a foreach to solve the problem but when I was performing some proofs Ive realized that the object was into the new array Hundreds of times so what I want to achieve with this is I want to compare the two arrays and if the entities which is on remote doesnt exist on precenial array then it should be added to a new arraylist, but if the entitie on remote object does exists then I want to add remote time to that objet and then add it to the new arraylist, but it doesnt work so suggestions are very welcome.p  pPD oh almost forgot it, the Br you see are for debugging just to know what is

I thought Ebean would keep this data in session and use that during update action. May be I was wrong.

Negative 321 pI need to package an app that can be invoked either doubleclick, or on the command line.

Negative 321 pI have hundreds of tabseparated text files and each one of them could have same or different set of headers. I want to do the following 1. Read the file 2. Get header names 3. For one of the given input header, get the count of one particular element from the column which is also given as input Since I have many files, I cant know the column number for each column of my interest.

If its not found, skip and go to the next file. Im stuck in the part where I give input column name and get its column number.p  pMy data looks like thisp  precodebarcodeID   codeID  conceptID   studyID Event   Time    Addidata UTGN02010001 653 1256213 UTGN    Adverse events  48h No UTGN02010002 158 1256213 UTGN    Adverse events  48h No UTGN02010003 630 1256213 UTGN    Adverse events  1d  No codepre  pSo when I give codepython programname.py codeID 630code, it should print codefilename.txt 1code since its occurred 1 time in column number 2 with codeID as headerp  pPS I dont want to use pandas or numpy since it needs additional installation on other devices that this scriptd run on. p

Negative 321 pI am using Camel 2.14.1 to build some RESTful services which use the Jackson json binding features of the Camel REST DSL. This is working great, but Id like to be able to send a custom response to a client when something goes wrong during the binding.p  pFor instance, if a codeNumberFormatExceptioncode is thrown when converting an input string value to an integer, because a client mistakenly sent characters which were not numbers. This exception is not a Jackson specific exception, so I cannot catch it to reply to a client with a binding failure message, as it could be a legitimate internal error.p  pSimilarly, Id like to catch any other exceptions thrown during the inbound binding of json to a POJO, and handle those in a similar way, at the very least informing the client that their payload was invalid.p  pSince this is all handled above my code, I cant see how to easily handle such errors, as its all dealt with in a library I have no control over. I am using Camels codeonExceptioncode clause to handle my own exceptions, so Im aware of that, just not sure how exactly to achieve what I need to...p  pWorst case, I guess I could take every client input as a string and bind it myself, but that seems to rather defeat the point of Jackson.p  ptldr Is there a pattern in Camel which would allow me to return a custom response when POJO binding fails from Jackson, using the REST DSLp  pstrongEditstrong  Heres some psuedocode to illustrate what Im trying to dop  precodeclass errorHandler     void handleExceptionExchange exchange, ExchangeException Exception exception       if myException.class.isAssignableFromexception.getClass         Set exchange body and response code header        This works as expected, though could probably do this more nicely           else if camelBindingOrJacksonBindingException         Some other custom handling like above, but specific for these exception types           else         Generic catch all with generic error response body        This also works fine          codepre  pCurrently I end up catching bindingJackson exceptions in the final else block, and thats what Im trying to avoid as really it would be more useful for the client to know their input wasnt valid. This seems equivalent to isaac.hazans answer below.p  pThe issue in doing this is that I cant find whether Jackson binding exceptions have a parent class which I can catch, a list of all such possible exceptions, or a way of telling that it came from binding.p  pThe second issue is that I cannot tell whether camel binding exceptions such as codeNumberFormatExceptioncode when Camel expects an int from a binding annotation on a method like codeHeader int numbercode, are genuinely from Camel, or from my own code. Very reluctant to catch any old codeNumberFormatExceptioncode because if further internal changes could throw this, Id end up returning an incorrect response. Is there maybe some way to figure out where the exception has come from whether it was at binding timep

Negative 321 pAll across the internet and several Stack Overflow pages, there are detailed instructions for the implementation of Floating Action Buttons, but nobody explains where I might be able to acquire the icon myself.

Negative 321 pWhat I want is to calculate the ROI of a campaign and this is my scenario. A user comes from Google Adwords into my webpage and then downloads a software. The software is coded in C. I know that there is a conversion option from Google that registers the action when the download button is clicked. But this is not the end because the ROI is not calculated when the software is downloade, but from his spending inside the software.p  pHowever, my question is more technical than that. What I want to achieve is to marry the adwords visitor with his downloadable software. Meaning, to pass a unique code or anything that works maybe a cookie from the webpage to the software.p  pSome possible answers that lack extended knowledge from my side arep  ol liCreate a cookie with a unique id when a user enters the webpage from google adwords, and then somehow the software will read it. As far as I know a software can not read a cookie I may be mistaken but what if on softwares first launch  opens a webpage on his browserli liMake use of IP address. So, if a user comes from google adwords, get his IP, save it into a database and the same happens when he opens the software. Theoretically you have a match.li ol  pDid you encounter such things Do you know any way that actually worksp

Negative 321 pIm reading the book CLR via C 4th edition, not as a newcomer to C but as someone who knows the language trying to improve my grasp on the underlying functionality of the CLR.p  pAnyway, in this book an example is given pg127131 when discussing boxingunboxing of value types which ends with a call to Console.WriteLine with a value type being concatenated to a string being passed as the argument.p  pThe book explains that boxing and unboxingcopy operations cause overhead, which I already knew, but it then stated that the example could be optimized by running .ToString on the value type being passed in.p  pI created an example program and compiled it, then used ILDASM to inspect the IL it generated. The version with ToString essentially is identical, but replaces the box instruction with a call to ToString no shock there.p  pI benchmarked the code in a loop of 100000 runs, and there was no difference it fluctuated which one was faster. I realize that other factors come into play when benchmarking caches, etc., but by the way the book explained it I had expected to see a significant difference when avoiding the box instruction even in a naieve benchmark..p  pIs it just that calling a function isnt much better Is there a boxing operation going on in the ToString that nullifies the benefits and the book is wrong Can someone shed some light on thisp  pFor reference, here are the two ILDASM readoutsp  hr  precode.method private hidebysig static void  Mainstring[] args cil managed    .entrypoint    Code size       24 0x18   .maxstack  2   .locals init int32 V0   IL0000  ldc.i4.4   IL0001  stloc.0   IL0002  ldloc.0   IL0003  box        [mscorlib]System.Int32   IL0008  ldstr      .

Negative 321 pHello fellow human beings,p  pI have a question about the output of p  precodelscpu codepre  pIt shows I have n processors but the number of online CPUs is actually equal to n1. Is this normal I think it is Why is one CPU offlinep  pThanks,p  pemeditem sorry I posted this in a programming forum. It happens. here is a sample outputp  precodeCPUs                8 Online CPUs list   06 codepre
Negative 321 pI know that a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comrestpublicratelimiting relnofollowTwitter limits the number of requesta you can made by user for an application but I did not understand it well.p  pIm using mainly Twitter API to Oauth then retrieve Users lists. So I can only call 15 GET within 15 minutes window per User  This is incredibly low or Im not doing things right  I always get Rate limit exceeded, mostly when Im doing some dev...p  pWhen the user is authenticated and load a page Im doing this to connect the user p  precodetwitterclient  TwitterRESTClient.new do config   config.consumerkey     xx   config.consumersecret  xx   config.accesstoken         xx   config.accesstokensecret  xx end codepre  pThen to retrieve his lists something like p  precodetwitterclient.listtimelinelistid.each do tweet   tweet.text end codepre  pIve done some test and the result annoy me a little. A User cannot for example reload the page more than 15 times before getting rate limited. Unfortunately, I cannot prevent Users from navigate into the website...p  pThe solution to bypass the rate limit error would be to a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferiktwitterblobmasterexamplesRateLimiting.md relnofollowuse the Rate Limit featurea from a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferiktwitter relnofollowthe gema but in this case, the User has no reason to stay on the website if it does not display anything.p  pThank you for letting me know if my interpretation  implementation of the Twitter API is good. Feel free to give me some tricks about it.p
Negative 321 pI have a problem with my game on Python. In fact, this game work with two computer network tcp. The servercomputer and clientcomputer work together but its too slowly. p  pFor resume  the server send the coordonates of multiple point and client must received it.

Negative 321 pI have a problem using an ObjectInputStream and I have been struggling with it for 2 days now. I tried to search for a solution but unfortunately found no fitting answer. p  pI am trying to write a clientserver application in which the client sends objects in this case a configuration class to the server. The idea is that connection keeps alive after sending the object so it is possible to send a new object if necessary. p  pHere are the important parts of my client codep  precodemSocket  new Socket192.168.43.56, 1234  mObjectIn  new ObjectInputStreammSocket.getInputStream mObjectOut  new ObjectOutputStreammSocket.getOutputStream  mObjectOut.writeObjectstubConfig mObjectOut.flush codepre  pIn the above code, I left out some trycatch blocks to keep the code readable for you. p  pThe server side looks as followsp  precodemHostServer  new ServerSocketport mSocket  mHostServer.accept   create streams in reverse oreder mObjectOut  new ObjectOutputStreammConnection.getOutputStream mObjectOut.flush mObjectIn  new ObjectInputStreammConnection.getInputStream  while mIsSocketConnected      StubConfig  StubConfigurationmObjectIn.readObject   codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is that as long at the socketconnection is alive, the server is listening for incoming config objects. p  pWhen I run my program however, I got an EOFException in the while loop at server side. I receive the first config object without any problems in the first iteration of the while loop but after that I get an EOFException every time readObject is called. p  pI am looking for a way to solve this. Can anyone put me in the good directionp  pEDIT What I read about the EOFException is that it is thrown when you want to read from a stream when the end of it is reached. That means that for some reason the stream ended after the object has been send. Is there a way to reinitialize the streams or sop

Negative 321 pSo, Ive created a Haxe function using the OpenFL library that saves text and image data to the games folder on desktop targets. A little while ago, however, I was notified a hrefhttpcommunity.stencyl.comindex.phptopic,35620.msg224122msg224122 relnofollowin this threada that the function would not work on mobile targets. The same user, strongthiagojaburstrong, also gave me a solution scroll down in the same thread. My main problem is that I dont have a mobile device myself that I can test on I have a Galaxy Tab4, but I havent gotten it working with my Haxe projects. Rather than send 100 versions to someone who emcanem test it, Ive decided to ask my questions here.p  pThe goal is to save the data into a folder with the games App ID. For instance, if the App ID is codecom.potato.potatogamecode, then the data will be saved on Android in the application storage directory, in the folder codeAndroiddatacom.potato.potatogamecode. I believe I can get the first part of the path using codeopenfl.utils.SystemPath.applicationStorageDirectorycode, but Im stuck on how to get the App ID. Does anyone know of a function which can do sop  pAlternatively, I may be misunderstanding a part of the code. From the way strongthiagojaburstrong used the code, it would seem that codeSystemPath.userDirectorycode returns codeAndroiddatacom.potato.potatogamecode on Android. Is this correct, or would I still need to build the path manuallyp  pAny help is appreciated. Thanks in advancep

But I still have to be able to sort through all 5000 records if I sort by any of the headers.  p  pI am some what new to working with this so I am not sure how I could go about doing that.p  pso to summarisep  pI have 5000 recordsp  pI want to have 100 of those records display when the page loadsp  pif I sort by any of the headers it needs to sort through all 5000 recordsp  pif I hit the next page button it needs to load up the next 100 records in line.p

Negative 321 pI need a component thats a browserbased file browser, and I expect some django app to currently provide this. Is there such a thingp  pThe full storyp  pIm building a django app that is used for testing. I want to use it to serve files and strings, and etc. and attach custom headers to it.p  pCurrently, I have a model codeFileSourcecode which has a single codefilepathcode field, which is of type codedjango.db.models.FileFieldcode.p  pWhen creating a FileSource from the admin, the user has a nice file upload dialog, and when saving, the file he chose, is saved on the server in a really weird location, inside the directory where django is installed, or something weird like that, because i didnt customize the storage, nor will it help me in any wayp  pMy problem I only want to use the file dialog for the user to select a strongfull pathstrong on strongthe serverstrong. The file that the user chose must be only referenced, not copied like currently, and it must reside on the server.  The server must thus be able to list the files it has, so i basically need a little browserbased filebrowser.p  pAt that point, I expect to be able to save a full path in my DB, and then Ill be able to access that file and serve it together with whatever custom headers the user will chose from my app.p  pCurrently, as you might know, the browsers always lie about the full path of the file. Chromium appends Cfakepath to the file name, so I need support of the backend to accomplish this.p  pAlso, I checked out codedjangofilebrowsercode and codedjangofilercode and from what I understood, they werent built for this. If Im wrong, a little assistence in configuring them would be awesome.p

Negative 321 pI am compiling a very large legacy Fortran 90 code screamer with gFortran on a Mac 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 running Yosemite. gFortran V5.1.0 I have 16 GB of RAM.

In this subroutine the large real8 matrix and real8 vectors are defined.p  pThis Register Instruction Pointer RIP error is noted many times on the web. So far this available information has not helped me solve my problem. Note the signed 4 byte integer limit is 2,147,483,647 so the error seems to be directly related to the use of a 32bit pointer.p  pThe gFortran compiler options include mcmodelmedium that should take the pointers to 64 bits. m64 has no effect. The total memory used by the primary matrix and vectors when the pointer limit is reached is greater than 2.4 GB. The confusing thing is that the code is fully 64 bit so I was not expecting 32bit pointers. See below for 64bit check. p  prbspielman file screamer64p  pscreamer64 MachO 64bit executable x8664p  pThe primary matrix and vector are all real8 64bit.

I can easily define static arrays to  10 GB without a problem. Larger arrays also work but end up using virtual memory and slow down as expected.p  pClearly there is some sort of memory or pointer size limit but I just cannot figure it out. The code matrix solvers are massive and more realistic test programs would be tedious.p  pI also compile screamer in Ubuntu LINUX without a problem up to the same array limit as the Mac. Compilations in Windows 8 fail at the usual 2 GB memory limit NOT at the pointer limit.p  pSuggestions would be appreciated. p  pRick Spielmanp

For example, the receipes for barrier or distributed queue suggest to open a node node is a file at specific paths are these nodes maintained inmemory or are they files on disk  HDFS I think traditional barriers across machines now need to be done via Curator barrier hence, wont these operations be slow if they involve heavy operationsp  pHow does the Curator barrier compare with traditional MPI barrier in terms of performancep

Negative 321 pI often read, that you should not hold data in the controller and use a service instead. And use the Controller more as a glue between the view and the service. br So I really to follow this rule and its making it a lot cleaner and easier, also when i need to access the same data from another controller. login, settingsp  pBut sometimes i have a really really big array of objects customers, items which i load now in the controller and not in the service.

Negative 321 pOk so I have two JFrames.  The first one is my main program.  The second one is accessed by selecting an option on the menu of the first one.  This second frame allows the user to enter values for different grades.  For example, they are able to set the range of the grade A from 90  100 or from 85  100.  Furthermore, they can add new grades like A or B, and set ranges for them too.  p  pIf the user wants to add a grade, he uses the Add Row option on the menu titled Actions.  The frame prompts the user to enter the grade he wants to add A, or B, he enters it and it should create a new row, with that grade, in the right place. p  pSo there is where my problem begins.  The headings and the grades are stored in an ArrayList of JLabels, and I wrote an algorithm to accurately predict the index of the new grade entered by the user B would be after A and before B.  So the entered grade is on the right position in my labels ArrayList. BUT for some reason, the new label doesnt add itself to my panel, and so cannot be seen by the user.p  pSome other information 1.

Negative 321 pI know from other answers that using string.split over Regex will be a lot faster with short strings. A particular script I am working on requires me to split a string on a delimiter and analyze every split a particular way depending on how many delimiters it is after. For example, my string may look like abd12332few3331212 etc....in this case, the delimiter is a . Depending on the situation, I will either need a few or all of the splits aka, for this example, I may need 32 and 333 and I will need to know that the 32 is after the 2nd dash and the 33 after the 4th. p  pMy current solution is to split on the delimiter and just iterate through that list for the values I need. What I am curious about is if there is a betterfaster way to do this. I have already confirmed that Regex is slower and does not meet my needs right out of the box...any other suggestionsp
Negative 321 pstrongI would like to update multiple JavaFX progress bars via a single task.strong The progress bars are created in another controller so I put the progress bars in a hashmap to access them through a public method.  I am choosing a single task instead of one task per progress bar to decrease the number of web service calls since each call will be bringing me all the needed information for all of the progress bars.  I was previously binding the progress property to a tasks progress property and that worked great.  strongAgain, changing to a single task to reduce web service calls made me curious as to the best way to go about updating multiple progress bars via a single task.strong  p  pThe following did not update the progress bars.

Negative 321 pI have a codeUICollectionViewcode a subclass of codeUIScrollViewcode that contains many codeUIButtoncodes. Each button responds to both codeTouchDowncode events as well as codeTouchUpcode events to send commands to a server. For example, a Volume Up button would send the codestartIncreasingVolumecode command on codeUIControlEventTouchDowncode and send the codestopIncreasingVolumecode command on codeUIControlEventTouchUpInsidecode, thus allowing the user to press and hold the button to ramp the volume up.p  pObviously, from a UX perspective, I dont want the user to inadvertently fire commands when theyre really just swiping the collection view between different pages of buttons. Therefore, I set the codedelaysContentTouchescode property to codetruecode on the collection view.p  pThis appears to partially work, as it does indeed provide a fraction of a second delay before the codeTouchDowncode event is fired. However, if, during that delay period, the collection view is scrolled, the codeTouchDowncode event is immediately fired anyway. This of course defeats the purpose, as it causes codeTouchDowncode events to be fired as the user is simply swiping between collection view pages and happens to swipe over the buttons.p  pWhat is the best way to resolve this I would have expected the codedelaysContentTouchescode property to be intended precisely to solve this problem and indeed it seems to in other classes like codeUITableViewcode, where cells are not inadvertently highlighted as you scroll the table view, but it doesnt appear to work in this case.p

Negative 321 pWith new clojure 1.7 I decided to understand where I can use transducers. I understand what benefit they can give, but I cant find normal examples of writing custom transducers with explanation.p  pOk, I tried to test what is happening. I opened the clojure documentation. And there examples use codexfcode as argument. First what means this xf or xfrom This stuff produced identity transducer.p  precodedefn myidentity [xf]   fn     []      println Arity 0.      xf    [result]      println Arity 1  result    xf result       xf result    [result input]      println Arity 2  result input    xf result input       xf result input codepre  pI took the naming of variables code[result input]code from documentation example. I thought its like in reduce function where coderesultcode is reduced part and codeinputcode is new collection element. p  pSo when I make codetransduce myidentity  range 5code I got result code10code what I was expecting. Then I read about codeeductioncode, but I cant understand what is it. Anyway I made codeeduction myidentity range 5code and gotp  precodeArity 2  nil 0    nil Arity 2  nil 1    nil Arity 1 nil    nil 0 0 1 1 codepre  pEvery item got duplicated because I call codexfcode in codeprintlncode statement.  Why it duplicated every item twice  Why I got nil  Will I always get nil while making an eduction  Can I relay on this behaviorp  pAnyway I didp  precodegt reduce  eduction myidentity range 5 clojure.core.Eduction cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IReduce codepre  pOk, the result is a codeEductioncode that is NOT reducible, but printed like a list.
