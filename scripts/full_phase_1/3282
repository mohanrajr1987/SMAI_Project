Negative 3282 pA question I have been thinking about for a while  would Stackoverflow users commonly implement significant functionality in a constructor specifically in classes derived from the System.Web.UI.Page class , or should we keep the logic here as simple as possible and instead implement functionality in OnPreInit using the constructor to simply instantiate objectsvalues that are required for the functionality in the rest of the page to function Is there a bestpractice approach to this scenariop  pThe background to this questionp  pThe system that I am working on has a fairly deep page hierarchy   there are about 10 chained page objects that the actual page derives fromp  pre   System.Web.UI.Page   CustomPage1  System.Web.UI.Page   CustomPage2  CustomPage1  etc  pre  pEach page adds a specific piece of functionality, and often there is either a dependancy on code run within the custom page constructor, or the functionality itself is directly run during construction.p  pThe example that best illustrates my question is the page that loads custom objects from our database to the page so they are available during the page lifecycle  during page construction connections are made to the database and then public properties are populated with the correct values. p  pTo my mind this is better done from the OnPreInit event, mainly because we have greater flexibility to perform some page level checks e.g. should we want to prevent this functionality being called before the parent logic is run given that in a constructor the order of execution will construct the parent classes before the child class. From an OO perspective as well OnPreInit seems to be a more appropriate area to implement this functionality  page construction should deal with construction of the page, setting any default values, etc and then OnPreInit would be used to perform any functionality that was required during the lifecycle of the page.p

Negative 3282 pWhat is the best practice to follow when you need to throw an exception which was not defined in an interface that you are implementingp  pHere is an examplep  precodepublic interface Reader      public abstract void read throws IOException   public class CarrotReader implements Reader      public void read throws IOException    public class CupcakeReader implements Reader      public void read throws IOException, CupcakeException   codepre  pIn this case, you have a specific exception that occurs when reading cupcakes, so you want to throw an exception related to this.  However, emReaderem doesnt define this type of exception in its interface, so what do you do  Furthermore, it doesnt make sense to add emCupcakeExceptionem to the emthrowsem clause in the emReaderem interface, because this type of exception is specific to emCupcakeReaderem.  One way around this is to have emReaderem define emreadem such that it throws some parent type, like emExceptionem, but then you lose the context for the exception.  What should you do in this situation  Thanksp  phr p  pAnother interesting situation that has been brought up involves an interface over which you have no control.

Negative 3282 pI have the following C design problem and I would really appreciate any suggestionsolution. Please notice that my background is not in computer science, so I may be missing some obvious solution.p  pThe way I usually separate key components in the code is to define interfaces via abstract classes and pure virtual functions.p  pExample1p  precodeclass B  public     virtual double f double x   0   class D1  public B  public     double f double x  const           return 0.0            class D2  public B      public     double f double x  const           return 1.0       codepre  pThis way I can nicely separate interface from implementation.  This approach is also quite fast and as what I am working on is a numerical library this is important P.p  pNow, the problem I am facing is the following one.p  pI have a set of functionalities which can be summarized by functions defined below f, g, and h Notice that all these functions will in general differ in arguments and return types.p  pSuppose I have some code that expects a pointer to an object that implements the functionalities f and g. What I would like to do is to being able to pass something which has more or equal functionalities, for example something which supports f, g and h.p  pTo better explain myself here is some code.  Please notice that instead of multiple inheritance I can have used a nested intheritance approach, like in boostoperators. The point here is that I will never have the case in which f is the same as g . All the features are different.  Te problem is that in order to make this work I need to use reinterpretcast as in the example below so this is not really a solutionp  pExample2p  precodeclass F  public     virtual double f double x   0   class G  public     virtual double g double x   0   class H  public     virtual double h double x   0   class N   templateltclass T1, class T2N, class T3Ngt class Feature  public T1 , public T2 , public T3    templateltclass T1, class T2gt class FeatureltT1,T2,Ngt  public T1, public T2    templateltclass T1gt class FeatureltT1,N,Ngt  public T1    Supp for SupportsImplements class SuppFandG  public FeatureltF,Ggt  public     double f double x   return 0.0      double g double x   return 1.0     class SuppFandH  public FeatureltF,Hgt  public     double f double x   return 0.0      double h double x   return 1.0     class SuppFandGandH  public FeatureltF,G,Hgt  public     double f double x   return 0.0      double g double x   return 1.0      double h double x   return 2.0    int main      FeatureltF,Ggt featureFandGPtr     FeatureltF,Hgt featureFandHPtr     FeatureltH,Fgt featureHandFPtr     FeatureltF,G,Hgt featureFandGandHPtr      SuppFandGandH suppFandGandH     featureFandGandHPtr  ampsuppFandGandH      featureFandGPtr  featureFandGandHPtr Illegal. staticcast illegal too.     the reason to do this is that I would like to pass a pointer to an object      of type FeatureltF,G,Hgt to a function or constructor that expects a pointer to FeatureltF,Ggt      featureFandGPtr  reinterpretcastlt FeatureltF,Ggt gt featureFandGandHPtr      featureFandHPtr  reinterpretcastlt FeatureltF,Hgt gt featureFandGandHPtr      featureHandFPtr  reinterpretcastlt FeatureltH,Fgt gt featureFandGandHPtr       featureFandGPtrgtf 1.0      featureFandGandHPtrgth 1.0   codepre  pOr I can try to construct a inheritance hierarcy but changing the definition of Feature but the following example makes the Visual studio 2008 professional compiler crash, so I cannot test it.p  pExample 3p  precodeThis will not work, Visual studio 2008 professional crash. templateltclass T1, class T2N, class T3Ngt class Feature  public FeatureltT1,T2gt , public FeatureltT1,T3gt , public FeatureltT2,T3gt    templateltclass T1, class T2gt class FeatureltT1,T2,Ngt  public FeatureltT1gt, public FeatureltT2gt    templateltclass T1gt class FeatureltT1,N,Ngt  public T1   codepre  pWith this approach I still have the problems 1 Feature is logically equivalent for what I want to achieve to Feature but their types are different. This can however be solved by some fancy metaprogramming using the MPL boost library always sort the types, so for simplicity lets assume this is not a problem.p  p2 Problem of multiple bases, and I want to avoid virtual inheritance via virtual bases performance penalty. This is probably solvable by using directives inside the Feature specializations.p  pStill I am not 100 sure I can make this work and it will not scale well for a large number of features. In fact the number of elements composing the hierarchi is given by the binomial coefficient, almost factorial F   F 1 F,G   FG, F, G 3br F,G,H  FGH, FG, GH, FH, F, G, H 7p  pI would like to know if there is a solution to the design problem which involves the following conditionsp  p1 The code should have a runtime performance equivalent to Example 1.p  p2 I want to be able to specify easily some set of features and being able to pass in any pointers to objects that have this and usually extra functionality.p  p3 I want code that depends on features f and g not to require recompiling whenever I consider a new feature h somewhere else.p  p4 I do not want to template everything that want to use such features almost all the code. There should be some kind of separation, see point 3.p  pLooking in the numerical libraries I have usually found the two approachesp  p1 Define a huge abstract base class B that have f,g,h,...... Problems whenever I want to add a new feature z, B has to be modified, everything needs to be recompiled even if this code does not care about z at all, all the existing implementations D1, D2,... of B needs to be modified usually by having them throw an exception for z apart for the new implementation that supports z. The solution of enlarging B progressively when I need to add features is not a good one for the problem at hand, as the featurs f and g are really as important as h and i, an neither is more basic then the others.p  p2 Separate all the functionalities and use one pointer for each functionality. However, this is cumbersome for the user in most situations 4 or more pointers would have to be carried around, and for the problem at hand this approach is not optimal here really it is 1 object that may or may not do something, in fact calling f will modify the result obtained by g and viceversa.p  pThank you in advance for your help.p  pKRao.p

I extended PulpCore with the JOrbis thing to allow OGG files to be played. Works fine. However, pulpCore seems to have a problem with looping the sound WHILE animating the volume level. I tried this with wav file too, to make sure it isnt jOrbis that breaks it. The code is like thisp  precodeSound bgMusic  Sound.loadmusicmusic.ogg Playback musicPlayback ...  musicVolume  new Fixed0.75 musicPlayback  bgMusic.loopmusicVolume TODO figure out why its NOT looping when volume is animated   musicVolume.animate0, musicVolume.get, FADEINTIME codepre  pThis code, for as long as the last line is commented out, plays the music.ogg again and again in an endless loop which I can stop by calling stop on the Playback object returned from loop. However, I would like the music to fade in smoothly, so following the advice of the PulpCore API docs, I added the last line which will create the fadein but the music will only play once and then stop. I wonder why is that Here is a bit of the documentationp  blockquote   pPlayback   pulpcore.sound.Sound.loopFixed levelp      pLoops this sound clip with the   specified volume level 0.0 to 1.0.   The level may have a property   animation attached.p      pParameters levelp      pReturns a Playback object for this   unique sound playback one Sound can   have many simultaneous Playback   objects or null if the sound could   not be played.p blockquote  pSo what could be the problem I repeat, with the last line, the sound fades in but doesnt loop, without it it loops but starts with the specified 0.75 volume level. Why cant I animate the volume of the looped music playback What am I doing wrong Anyone has any experience with pulpCore and has come across this problem Anyone could please download PulpCore and try to loop music which fadesin outp  pnote I need to keep a reference to the Playback object returned so I can kill music later.p
Negative 3282 pIve created a custom UITypeEditor. p  pCan I possibly insert an attribute that also attaches a TypeConverter to my property from eminsideem the UITypeEditor classp  pIve tried the following, but nothing happens, no matter how I twist and turn itp  precodeAttribute[] newAttributes  new Attribute[1] newAttributes[0]  new TypeConverterAttributetypeofBooleanConverter codepre  pNow, the above needs to have the following attached to it somehowp  precodeTypeDescriptor.AddAttributescontext.Instance.PROPERTYNAME, newAttributes codepre  p...but first of all I dont know how to get to the property in question in a generic way, and all code I try just fails.

Negative 3282 pI am processing images to change their color from black to red, blue, green etc based on the requirement.  I use SetPixel methods to change color of each pixel of the image from black to say red.  p  pIt works mostly fine except the borders and some curves within the image.

Negative 3282 pI am writing a Message Handler for an ebXML message passing application.  The message follow the RequestResponse Pattern.  The process is straightforward The Sender sends a message, the Receiver receives the message and sends back a response.  So far so good.p  pOn receipt of a message, the Receiver has a set Time To Respond TTR to the message.  This could be anywhere from seconds to hoursdays.p  pMy question is this How should the Sender deal with the TTR  I need this to be an async process, as the TTR could be quite long several days.  How can I somehow count down the timer, but not tie up system resources for large periods of time.  There could be large volumes of messages.p  pMy initial idea is to have a Waiting Collection, to which the message Id is added, along with its TTR expiry time.  I would then poll the collection on a regular basis.  When the timer expires, the message Id would be moved to an Expired Collection and the message transaction would be terminated.p  pWhen the Sender receives a response, it can check the Waiting collection for its matching sent message, and confirm the response was received in time.  The message would then be removed from the collection for the next stage of processing. p  pDoes this sound like a robust solution.  I am sure this is a solved problem, but there is precious little information about this type of algorithm.  I plan to implement it in C, but the implementation language is kind of irrelevant at this stage I think.p  pThanks for your input p

Negative 3282 pWhen running The Allocations Instrument at any given moment my iPad app has less than 5MB of memory allocated. Ive been very thorough and made sure everything is being released correctly. My app is a tab bar app that does load a lot of images, videos, and PDFs.

Negative 3282 pThere have been a couple of hints that seem to have gotten me close here, but with some unique issues, Im hoping this question is distinguishing enough to merit its own posting.p  pFor starters heres what I have.  I have an Oracle procedure that returns a standard codeREF CURSORcode, and this codeREF CURSORcode is passed back to my application.  The codeREF CURSORcode is a list of lookup IDs.p  pI then want to take this list and bring it to another data store and use it in a select statement.  It will absolutely be possible to accomplish this by looping through the REF CURSOR, but Im hoping to avoid that.  I would much rather be able to write a codeSELECT...WHERE lookupid IN resultrefcursorcode OR codeSELECT...WHERE EXISTS...codep  pFirst is this possible or should I just try a less than elegant solution  If it is possible, any hints as to where I should get started lookingp  pIm relatively new to Oracle, but fairly experienced in RDBMs in general, so feel free to just through some links at me and I can study up.  Much appreciatedp

Negative 3282 pI am developing my knowledge of OOP design patterns and as my main focus is website development and web app development, I have tried to find examples of design patterns in these fields but seem to come across web frameworks mainly any other examples would be appreciated. It seems to me that the majority all of PHP based frameworks appear to use the MVC design pattern. As this is the most widely used would it be right to assume that it is the best design pattern for this type of development or is it a reflection of a shallower learning curve as opposed to other design patternsp  pI have also noticed that the codeigniter framework uses both a singleton pattern and an MVC pattern. Is this kind of hybrid design pattern common and is it effective or is was it used in codeigniter for a specific reasonp

Negative 3282 pI am working on a vulnerability scanner in Java to check for websites that allow connections using weak cipher suites.

Here is where I am so farp  p1 HttpURLConnection works good all the time with default ciphers but if I try to use System.setProperty to set a weak cipher, I either get cipher not supported exception for most of the cipher suites or connection rejected exception when I try to connect. I know connection rejected is my answer to the websites that dont accept weak ciphers, but how do I get the actual http reponse header with rejection code instead of the exceptionp  p2 I am actually not interested in finding vulnerability on the SSL level layer 6 but on HTTP level layer 7 and I know that http header may be deceptive in some instances, but I am OK with that.p  pIn summary, I need something like this to work for Weak Cipher Suites onlyp  precode        URL url  new URLip         HttpsURLConnection con  HttpsURLConnection url.openConnection         con.setHostnameVerifiernew HostnameVerifier              public boolean verifyString hostname, SSLSession session                  return true                               con.connect         System.out.printlnResponse Code    con.getResponseCode codepre

So once all Employee and Team objects are created I have simply tried changing all calls to those to references, e.g.p  precodeteam1gtmanagers[]  ampemployee1 employee0gtmanagers[]  ampemployee1 codepre  pBut this momentarily increased memory usage which was surprising to me.

Similarly codeStaffTeammanagerscode would be an array of references to codeStaffemployeescode, etc.br But as I mentioned  as soon as I start using references memory usage rises.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongbr So how should I handle this thenbr Should I use passbyreference and dont worry about memory usage, or should I use passbyvaluebr Which ones better in this case and whyp  pstrongNote1strong I think I do understand the difference between passing an object by value and by reference.

Negative 3282 pI have a collection of terms, each of which I want to underline in the contents of a WPF Rich Text Box. Using techniques I found here and elsewhere, Im able to do just that, as long as each term in my collection is a single word. If I have a multiword term e.g. 2 words, where the first word is also present as a singleword term, it doesnt work. The solution to that particular problem is to do a descending sort of my collection. The problem now is that if the second word is also present as a single word term, specifically where it appears earlier in my reverse sort list, the multiword term will not get the underline.p  pSo just to be complete, my terms collection contains Actual Customer, Campaign, Campaign Offset, Campaign Site, Customer, and Site. I reverse sort this collection before I iterate it. I get everything underlined except for the word Actual in Actual Customer and Campaign in Campaign Site.  Im pretty sure this is happening because the underline is getting added to the RTF markup and therefore shortcircuits the call to GetTextInRun in the GetTextRangeFromPosition.

Negative 3282 pIm adding files to an existing InstallShield MSI project, building the MSI, and then creating an MSP from it to apply to existing installations.p  pProblem is, when I add new files to the MSI project, the sequence numbers arent set incrementally. I went into the Direct Editor, and edited the sequence numbers to make them start where the old ones stopped, but when I build the project, the sequence numbers I entered are ignored.  If the sequence numbers are different like this, it will cause the MSP to not install correctly. p  pIs there a way to fix the sequence numbers getting overriden by InstallShield If I dont add any new files to the project, the sequence numbers of the existing files stay the same. Its as if the new files Im adding are getting installed in the middle.p  pAny thoughts p  pThanksp

Negative 3282 pI currently upload to a webservice on an nginx server using the upload module a hrefhttpwww.grid.net.runginxupload.en.html relnofollowhttpwww.grid.net.runginxupload.en.htmla from a custom desktop application doing a simple multipartform POST that sends a file in one part and a base64 encoded XML with the files metadata in another part. p  pThe server receives this POST, passes it to my webservice which reads the metadata, processes the file and all is good.p  pWhat I want to do now is use the upload modules uploadresumable directive to do the POST in several chunks to minimize disconnection chances and allow resume. I can currently do this following the protocol described here a hrefhttpwww.grid.net.runginxresumableuploads.en.html relnofollowhttpwww.grid.net.runginxresumableuploads.en.htmlap  pOne sends byte ranges of the file along with some headers to identify the chunk and the session in several posts and once all the parts have been uploaded, nginx will compose the final POST containing the file name and path and pass it to your uploadpass location which in my case CGIs to a django app.p  pHowever, I am not clear on how one would send a multipart post with this method since the protocol indicates that the body of the POST must be the bytes indicated in the byte range. I need the final post to also contain the XML I wrote about above. p  pI can think of sending the XML as the first bytes of the body and a header that indicates how many bytes belong to it but that would mean extra handling of the final file to remove that header and the final files are potentially in the GB size range.p  pAny other ideasp

Negative 3282 pToday I wrote a performance testing program to insert data and add attachments to couchdb. The server software is couchbase which is a wrapper of couchdb and the operating system is Windows 2003 server. The program is developed in C and the couchdb driver is LoveSeatwhich encapsulates some http methods to deal with couchdb. The data is quite simple, but the attachments are not small, about 70kb each. There were about 200 attachments and I was attaching them repeatedly. I started 5 threads in the client program.p  pEverything looked all right until couchdb server terminated unexpectedly. Actually it was not the first time it crashed. At first I thought it was because of the client program. But at last I found couchdb crashed. I dont think it was because of the data or attachment. because I was inserting the same data and adding the same attachment repeatedly. The program run for about an hour without problem until it crashed.  p  precode[Tue, 05 Jul 2011 110019 GMT] [info] [lt0.142.0gt] 192.168.1.135   GET test67366 200  [Tue, 05 Jul 2011 110019 GMT] [info] [lt0.108.0gt] 192.168.1.135   GET test7136 200  [Tue, 05 Jul 2011 110019 GMT] [info] [lt0.108.0gt] 192.168.1.135   GET test47306 200  [Tue, 05 Jul 2011 110019 GMT] [info] [lt0.108.0gt] 192.168.1.135   GET test27257 200  [Tue, 05 Jul 2011 110019 GMT] [info] [lt0.108.0gt] 192.168.1.135   PUT test7136frev1334efd144dcdc52fd3a3a981dce4472f 201  [Tue, 05 Jul 2011 110025 GMT] [error] [lt0.145.0gt]  Generic server lt0.145.0gt terminating   Last message in was preadiolist,4294342003  When Server state  file,filedescriptor,primfile,Portlt0.3143gt,1464,                               0,4295164786  Reason for termination    badmatch,ok,ltlt183,92,29,219,169,127,153,2,50,217,252,186,178,175,202,                     144,215,209,191,69,109,230,227,154,114,174,173,157,231,                     153,246,124,105,239,174,51,143,24,108,175,101,215,175,                     221,35,99,53,124,108,109,249,112,202,29,85,87,81,176,94,                     219,11,103,129,231,25,111,242,108,246,207,107,72,173,172,                     57,246,195,16,236,79,243,134,211,93,131,218,180,93,240,                     173,213,199,226,175,176,217,250,154,89,39,237,157,250,77,                     173,151,156,139,248,106,85,21,134,253,85,234,108,85,208,                     67,177,130,124,247,161,98,77,173,126,170,111,80,84,45,                     212,201,72,149,90,138,252,89,23,85,165,252,105,187,191,                     41,86,125,148,106,149,175,252,78,185,198,154,207,172,142,                     148,101,83,140,99,222,102,26,41,131,206,132,221,31,74,3,                     172,176,158,236,136,71,120,169,63,35,161,251,208,86,202,                     1,95,208,25,51,76,250,100,182,177,122,31,91,230,249,214,                     245,229,250,212,118,86,167,120,116,6,173,78,113,18,171,                     143,215,191,38,207,51,92,150,10,10,83,164,98,154,181,157,                     ......... a loooooot of numbers.  codepre

Negative 3282 pFor practical purposes but also as a learning exercise, I am wanting to create notification application to remind me of friends Birthdays. I would like the application to be running in the background so that it can check the current date against user configured reminders. If a reminder is due then the user is displayed a simple Window that will allow them to snooze or dismiss the notification. I want the application to have user specific notifications i.e. User As notifications are not seen when User B is logged in.p  pOption 1  Application launched upon Windows startup I thought about keeping it simple by checking when to display notifications only when the application starts up. I would then put a shortcut in the Windows Startup folder. However, this probably wouldnt work if the PC is put to sleep and resumed each day.p  pOption 2  Application constantly running in background I then thought about making the application so it minimises to an icon in the System Tray and thus would constantly be running in the background. It would then periodically check when to display notifications.p  pOption 3  Using Windows Service with application I then thought about using a Windows Service to do the periodic checks as to when to display notifications. Obviously, a Windows Service cannot display UI notifications so it would need to use some other mechanism for notification e.g. sending an email. An application could then be used to configure settings that the service uses.p  pAre there any other options that I have not considered which would work better. Im currently inclined to go with option 2 for my first implementation but could look to move to a better solution afterwards.p  pTIAp

The trick is, I cant seem to be able to do this is WordPress without creating Davis twice, either as a post or page, which is not at all what I want to do. Im trying to keep the site as lightweight as possible and I want to avoid duplicating content and other bad practices.p  pIm a beginner to PHP but I was wondering if you fine folks knew of another small CMS or PHP framework out there that might support this type of structure. Ive looked into Drupal but it seems too bulky for my needs. Would there be a lightweight framework thats simple enough to pick up rather quickly Im a pretty fast learner, but dont have a lot of experience with these types of customizations, although I do understand the concepts involved.p  pA little more info about the site, it has four main parent galleries and about 20 child galleries. Im hoping to use an FTP solution for image uploading, so the CMS only needs to handle the permalink structure, a few page templates and styling. It should also be relatively SEOfriendly. p  pAlso, if somebody does know how to achieve what Im trying to accomplish in WordPress, that would be great too. Im not opposed to using WordPress in general as Ive used it several times before, its just that Ive done my research and nobody seems to have a solution to the problem Im facing.p

Is there a way of doing that p  pI would imagine as a subproblem it would be nice to get access to the information that the debugger has.p  pThe rationale for this is Im interested in only breaking on a certain breakpoint given a certain callstack and at a certain point in the execution of one of those functions in the callstack.

Negative 3282 pI have an ajax function search for keywords in a big database. The php being called simply says no if theres nothing, but if there are found records, it goes ahead and creates all of the HTML and returns the html, so that AJAX only needs to put the returned text into the html of a div. My problem is that Id like to pass along a couple of variables, like the number of records found, etc. p  pSo if I tried to put it in a statement that javascript could eval, Im afraid that not only is all of the html potentially big enough to cause some sort of variable problems, but it also has a lot of single and double quotes, etc, that could unexpectedly end the variable before its supposed to.  See the following p  precode I know I dont have a single quote after data and that will break it.

Negative 3282 pLet A be an array of arbitrary dimension 2 or 3 in my case. How can I flatten reshape to 1D this array without knowing in advance the number of dimensions p  pIf I knew the number of dimensions, I could easily obtain the total number of elements by using a combination of Array Size function and then reshape A to 1D using this number. Unfortunately, the Array Size function itself returns an array whose number of elements is equal to the number of dimensions, which brings us back to the initial problem.p  pI have solved the problem by creating a function VI that returns the total number of elements of a 3D array the most common type of arrays that I expect to handle, so that I can give this as an argument to the Reshape function. Problem it wont accept a 2D array, even though the algorithm would work with such an array  it seems that in Labview, array controls are strict about the number of dimensions they accept, which isnt the case in Matlab for instance.p  pA nice solution would be a simple way to multiply all the elements of the array given by Array Size to quickly get the total number of elements, without having to wrap this in a sub VI. Overall, isnt there a simple and efficient way to solve this problem  It should be quite standard..p

The implementation of the above overloaded contructor looks likep  precodetemplate lttypename arraytype, typename ptrtohash, typename hashtypegt hashltarraytype, ptrtohash, hashtypegthashconst intamp dim, stdifstreamamp in, const char file, ptrtohash hashptr       do some stuff to allocate from file       point function pointer to correct function     hashptr  ampthisgtinserttohash  codepre  pNow in main I am attempting to create a pointer to my hash function. So I first create a codevoidcode function pointer and then pass that to my overloaded constructorp  precodeint main       create void function pointer     void foo      create hash obj. from data read in from argv[1]     hashlt memberltintgt, void, memberltintgt gt awesome countlinesin,file, in, file, foo  codepre  pIn the above codememberltintgtcode is a template struct and codecountlinescode just returns an integer value for the amount lines in the file. When I attempt to do this I get the errorp  precodeno matching function for call to hashltmemberltintgt, void, memberltintgt gthashint, stdifstreamamp, const charamp, void amp codepre  pWhen I look at the error above I seem to be passing my codefoocode function pointer object as codeampcode which of course does not match any function calls in my class.p  pThat is the crux of my problem. I am unsure of how to pass a function pointer that points to my codevoid inserttohashcode in my codehashcode class when using templates. I am clearly doing it wrong.p

To execute maintenance tasks on the database nodes, Id like to migrate all connections away from database node 1, then switch the node off for maintenance.p  pWhat I would like is to make sure that database connections dont stay open for more than X minutes.

Negative 3282 pI am trying to resolve a 100 cpu usage by the SQL Server process on the database server. While investigating, I have now come across the fact that the stored procedures are taking the most worker time. p  pFor the following query of dmvs to find queries taking highest time, p  precodeSELECT TOP 20 st.text                ,st.dbid                ,st.objectid                ,qs.totalworkertime                ,qs.lastworkertime                ,qp.queryplan FROM sys.dmexecquerystats qs CROSS APPLY sys.dmexecsqltextqs.sqlhandle st CROSS APPLY sys.dmexecqueryplanqs.planhandle qp ORDER BY qs.totalworkertime DESC codepre  pmost of them are stored procedures. The weird thing is that all these stored procedures are querying different tables. And yet they are the top of taking the most worker time, even though when I look at the Profiler for queries with top CPU, Reads, Duration, the stored procedures dont figure at the top there. p  pWhy could this be happeningp  pEdit The application actually uses adhoc queries more than stored procedures. Some of these procedures are to be migrated to using adhoc queries. The thing is that these procedures are not called as often as some of the other queries, which are cpu intensive, and are called very frequently.  Also, it does strike me odd that a stored procedure with which does a simple select a,b,c from tbl where idid would have a higher total worker time than a query which has mulitple joins, user defined functions in the where clause, a sort and a rownumber over and while the simple one queries a table with 20000 records, the complex query is on a table with over 200,000 records. p

Then I decided to add an Image to the background of my panel, so I switched my JPanel to an ImagePanel. The buttons were working on JPanel, but now that I added a bunch of code for the background image to be displayed, the buttons no longer show. I did not change of any of the button adding code so Im very confused as to why the buttons no longer show. This also happened in my separate GameFrame class. I added 2 rectangle components to a panel, then 3 buttons. For that panel, only the buttons show, despite the rectangles working before the buttons were added. Can I only have one type of JComponent per panel or something I really do not understand why its doing this.

Negative 3282 pMy application relies on the intent codeACTIONUSERPRESENTcode being fired, and so I set up a receiver in the manifest and I have a class that starts a service when it receives the intent.p  pHowever, when a user is using a lockscreen replacement app like WidgetLocker, the codeACTIONUSERPRESENTcode intent may never be sent, or can be sent a bunch of times. Once it was sent 5 times...  WidgetLockers website explains that the application emdoesem send its own intent for unlocking, codecom.teslacoilsw.widgetlocker.intent.UNLOCKEDcode.  In certain configurations of WidgetLocker, codeACTIONUSERPRESENTcode may be fired before the user even unlocks the screen, so I was told that it would be best to set up a check for codecom.teslacoilsw.widgetlocker.intent.LOCKEDcode, and then wait to receive the codeUNLOCKEDcode intent and do my work.p  pMy problem is that Im not sure how to set up a receiver for a third party intent.  Ive added the actions to my receiver in the manifest just find, and I know that my broadcast receiver picks them up, but I need to filter them out.  Mainly, if I pick up the codeLOCKEDcode intent, I want to ignore any codeACTIONUSERPRESENTcode intents, and instead wait for the codeUNLOCKEDcode intent, but I dont know how to wait for an intent upon receiving a different one.p

However, in 4 I want there to be a button that can segue back to one. I only pictured one way of doing this, but I couldnt figure out how to implement it...p  pThis way would be to have a segue directly connecting 41, and when the segue is called delete 2 and 3 from memory otherwise the user could keep building up codeUIViewControllercodes since none of them are being removed. I dont know how to delete them from memory since I dont have any variables pointing to them that is, they were created when their respective segues were called, so as far as I know I dont have direct access to them.p  pI dont know if thats the best way, but if you can figure out how to do that or a better way, any help is appreciated p

Negative 3282 pHow would one implement a feedforward neural network with a configurable number and dynamic behavior of inputs and outputsp  pI am trying to add neural networks to the entities in a game Im working on. However, for every entity type I add I have to create a new neural network with a different number of inputs and outputs, then hardcode how the inputs are set and how the outputs are used to direct behavior.p  pI would like to find a way to dynamically set all of this, so I dont have to rewrite a new neural net for each entity type.p  pAs I am using C, I currently have a vector of doubles as the input and output containers. Currently my NN algorithm iterates through every element in a layer including the input layer and passes the information to the next layer, I believe this will work fine for now though Im open to suggestions. However, my real issue is how to have different behavior for each type of entity without limiting the number of inputsoutputs, or the types of sensesbehaviors an entity is allowed to possess.p  pAs an example, say I want to add a creature to the game that can see other creatures, smell food, bite as an attack, and move along the ground. Each eye would be an input, along with the sense of smell biting would be an output, along with x and y movement. I would need a way to calculate the input values, and extract meaning from the output values in the neural net.p  pNow if I also wanted to add a creature that can smell other creatures, locate their direction from itself, shoot spines, and float through the air, I would need a different number of input and output calculations input smell, location output shoot, x, y, z movement.p  pI would like each entity type to have its own neural net structure, yet have an overall standard interface for the AI system to work with when handling and iterating through each individual network. More specifically, when handling gamesenses to input conversion, and output to gamebehavior conversion.p  pI want emergent behavior from the creatures I add, so I dont know what the correct output will be. Because of this, Im using a simple genetic algorithm to control weight evolution.p  pSince I havent been able to find much information regarding my issue, the only idea Ive come up with so far is to implement each entitys senses and behaviors as a vector of function pointers, with each function corresponding to a particular input or output. While this allows me to customize how each entity works, and retain a single system for the AI, Im not sure if this is the most efficient way of accomplishing what I want.p  pThe process function does all of the work in the LearningSystem classp  precodevoid LearningSystemprocessint const lastframetime      stdsetltunsigned intgt constamp learninglist  eManagergtgetAllEntitiesPossessingComponentComponentTypeintelligence      vectorltdoublegt outputs, inputs     for auto entity  learninglist          Intelligenceamp intel  eManagergtgetComponentltIntelligencegtentity, ComponentTypeintelligence         Sensorsamp sensor  eManagergtgetComponentltSensorsgtentity, ComponentTypesensors         Behavioramp behavior  eManagergtgetComponentltBehaviorgtentity, ComponentTypebehavior           calculate each input value         for unsigned int i  0 i lt sensor.sensorlist.size i              sensor.triggers[i]sensor.sensorlist[i]                    retrieve the inputs from the sensors...         inputs  sensor.sensorlist          ...and add the bias         inputs.pushbackbias           for each layer         for auto i  intel.vecLayers               clear the internal outputs             outputs.clear               for each neuron             for auto j  i.vecNeurons                   reset the neuron value                 double neuronValue  0.0                   for each weightinput pair, sum the weights  inputs                 for auto k  j.vecWeights.begin, in  inputs.begin k  j.vecWeights.end k, in                      neuronValue  k  in                                    store the internal outputs for use by the next layer                 outputs.pushbacksigmoidneuronValue                            assign the inputs for the next layer...             inputs  outputs              ...and add the bias             inputs.pushbackbias                   behavior.values  outputs           calculate actions based on output values         for unsigned int i  0 i lt behavior.values.size i              behavior.actions[i]behavior.values[i]                codepre  pI am curious about other ways of implementing this idea, and if there are any resources which address this kind of issue.

Negative 3282 pI am having trouble getting my codeCustomTableViewCellcode, a subclass of codeUITableViewCellcode to appear in my table view.p  pI am using a xib to represent that cell, but I am assuming that the code for the data source delegate doesnt change. I made sure to set an identical reuse identifier inside the table view cell XIB. p  pI isolated the problem to the fact that the datasource method that returns the table cell isnt working correctly, here it isp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      static NSString CellIdentifier  Cell     CustomTableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]      DataObject foo  [self.dataArray objectAtIndexindexPath.row]      if cell  nil               cell  [[CustomTableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]           [[cell overview] setTextfoo.overview]     [[cell price] setTextfoo.price]     NSLogcell initialized, description text is ,cell.overview.text      return cell  codepre  pNot sure why this isnt working, but that last log statement always prints a null at the end, and yes I did verify that the codeoverviewcode property of the data object has a valid string in it. Same thing for codepricecode.p

Negative 3282 pI was wonder if this would be possible and how to do it.  I have a personal website. I wanted to have it so that in order for the visitor to gain access to a specific page,the website checks to see if that visitor is a fan of our page on facebook. If they are not, they must become one to advance to the page content on my website.  I thought perhaps there is a code that would do this Maybe some kind of tokencookie combo  Any help would be great. Iv been searching for a solution to this.  The page on my personal site gets a lot of traffic so I want to require all visitors to that page to become a facebook fan and the site verifies this before letting them into the page.p
Negative 3282 pAs far as I understand, RSA keys are usually generated based on a strong random generator.p  pInstead, I want to create them based on a password. p  pOr rather on its hash, for example sha512sha512passwordsaltpasswordpepperp  pThis needs to be done client side, in JavaScript. p  pWould anyone know how to do this Is there an easy JavaScript library that creates RSA key pairs deterministically, based on a given inputp  pActually, Im mentioning RSA but any secure asymmetrical encryption would suffice, I just need publicprivate encryptionp  hr  pAddition I need this because Im building some secure communication solution, that doesnt need to rely on the connection or even the server to be secure. p  pIm encrypting all content with AES using random keys, and the keys are RSAencrypted. The idea is Alice can RSAencrypt her content or actually, the AESkey for her content with Bobs public key therefore Bobs public key must be stored online.p  pLater, when Bob enters his password again, his browser can deterministically calculate his RSA private amp public key on the spot, download the content from Alice, and decrypt it locally using his private key.p

However, codencode can be large from code20code to about code6070code and computing its value takes long time.p  pI dont think the details emabout the functionem are of big relevance, but here are some it consists of a weighted sum of code2030code smaller functions all different, which on their part consist of sums of dot products under the sign of an inverse sinusoidal function codearcsincode, codearccoscode, codearctancode, etc. Something like codearcsinX1 . X2  arcsinX4 . X7  ...code.p  pThe function has many local minima in general, so approaches such as naive conjugated gradients or quasiNewton are useless. Searching the entire domain brute force is too slow.p  pMy initial idea was to use some sort of massive parallelization in combination with a genetic algorithm, which performs many searches on different spots in the domain of the function, and at regular intervals checks whether some of the searches reached local minima. If yes, it compares them and discards all results but the smallest one, and continues the search until a reasonably small value is found.p  pMy two questions arep  p1 Is it possible to implement this problem in CUDA or a similar technology Can CUDA compute the value of a function like this fast enoughp  p2 Would be betterfaster to implement the problem on a multicore PC with 12 coresp

If you look inside Ruport, you see that both rowswithcountry  and tocsv  are Ghost Methods. The RuportDataTable class is somewhat as defined above.  p  pA call to rowswithcountry  becomes a call to a more traditionallooking method, rowswithcountry, which takes the column name as an argu ment.

Negative 3282 pIm developing an protected mode application for FreeDOS using DOS Extender. My application does intensive IO. p  pAs all DOS Extenders run their applications in Ring3 ie CPL3 and themselves run at Ring 0 ie CPL0, some questions about IO protection arise in my mind.p  pFrom x86 docs, I get the following infop  pIOPLsensitive instructions  IN, INS, OUT, OUTS, CLI, and STI.p  pIf CPL lt IOPL, no exception is generated and the IOPLsensitive instruction is executed.p  pIf CPL  IOPL, and the instruction is one of these instructions IN, OUT, INS, or OUTS, the processor checks the current tasks IO permission bit map in its TSS to determine if the current application is permitted to access the addressed IO ports. If the bit map indicates that the task is permitted to access the indicated IO ports, no exception is generated and the IO instruction is executed. Otherwise, a GP exception is generated.p  pIf CPL  IOPL, and the instruction is either CLI or STI, the processor generates a GP Exception.p  pThis means if our app. runs at Ring3, then to exceute IN,OUT,INS,OUTS instructions, we must have either CPL lt IOPLthis translates to IOPL3, in our case, or if CPL  IOPL this translates to IOPL lt 2, ie IOPL  0, as usually Ring1 and Ring2 are not used. the IO permission bitmap must be set by DOS Extender while launching our app., such that our app. is permitted to access emanyem IO port.p  pBut in latter case, we still cant use CLI and STI instructions from our Ring3 application, as CPL  IOPL.p  pSo, it turns out that, the following instructions can be executed only if CPL lt IOPL  IN, INS, OUT, OUTS, CLI, and STI . In our case, this translates to 3 lt IOPL, ie IOPL  3.p  pNow my question is, emdoes all dos extenders set IOPL  3, in the TSS of the taskapplication they start em p  pIf they dont, then they must run the taskapplication in Ring0 CPL0, otherwise the application cant execute IOPL sensitive instructions.p  pThe docs also state thatp  pemA program or task can change its IOPL only with the POPF and IRET instructions however, such changes are privileged. No procedure may change the current IOPL unless it is running at privilege level 0 ie CPL0. An attempt by a less privileged procedure to change the IOPL does not result in an exception the IOPL simply remains unchanged.emp  pThis means that if POPF or IRET instructons are encountered in Ring 3 code, then IOPL field will not be modifiedrestored, and no exception is generated by the CPU.p  pThis is ok, as we dont wanna modify IOPL field, and let it be handled by DOS Extender. But emdoes it meanem that other flagsembit0 to bit11 of EFLAGS reg.em  emwill beem restored  p  pMy app. may need to execute POPF instruction and IRET too.p  pThe doc also states p  pemA procedure may use the POPF instruction to change the setting of the IF flag only if CPL lt IOPL. An attempt by a less privileged procedure to change the IF flag does not result in an exception the IF flag simply remains unchanged.emp  pThis mean that if a POF instruction is encountered in Ring3 code, then IF flag is modified only if CPL lt IOPL, ie 3 lt IOPL or IOPL  3. Again we need IOPL to be 3. p  pIm seeking for a generic answer ie not DOS Extender specific. This is becoz, it seems that although they differ in implementations , but the basic principles remain same bw DOS extenders for e.g. they run an application in Ring3.p

But how do you do it, step by step.p  pSecond, once you have a rebuilt package installed, what if a newer version of NGiNX is released, and you want to upgrade it by running a simple aptget upgrade command.  Would it do it or do you have to redownload and rebuild the package Also, if it doesnt work like that, how do you make it work like thatp  pSomeone please give a clear answer.  THanks so muchp

Negative 3282 pAn example should hopefully demonstrate the issue. I have 10 documents that are displayed on the page, 3 of them have additional information contained inside zip packages.  During the initial page load, I only know which documents have this additional information, I do emnotem know the URL to these zip files.  So then, I display a link Get Zip Package to the 3 documents which contain additional zip files.  When user clicks on Get Zip Package, it calls a method in the backing bean which goes to the database to figure out the URL of the zip package.  Once this is done, I would like to serve the zip package to the browser which would then pop up as Save As... dialog and user can save the zip package.p  pI have tried two approaches but neither of them work.p  pstrongApproach 1strongp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltpcommandLink actionListenermyBackingBean.zipPackageaDocument                valueGet Zip Package                ajaxfalse                renderedaDocument.packageAvailablegt codepre  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic String zipPackageDocItem item   logic here to figure out the URL for this items zip package   return packageLink  codepre  pstrongApproach 2strongp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodelthoutputLink onclickgetPackageLink[nameproduct, value aResult.product, nameversion,valueaResult.version]    lthoutputText valueGet Documentation Packagegt lthoutputLinkgt ltpremoteCommand namegetPackageLink actionListenerkbBackingBean.zipPackagegt codepre  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic String zipPackage    Map map  FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getRequestParameterMap   String product  String map.getproduct   String version  String map.getversion   logic here to figure out the URL for this items zip package   return packageLink  codepre  pAs the page loads and the 10 documents are displayed, the Get Zip Package link for the 3 documents points to nothing, essentially has the same URL as the page.  When I click on it, it sends a GET request to the server and calls the backing bean function as well.  With approach 1, the browser does appear to wait for the backing bean method to finish before it begins rendering a response.  With approach 2, there is no wait and the browser immediately reloads the page.  I suspect that since the Get Zip Package link points to the page itself, browsers GET request gets processed first and the backing bean methods response simply gets lost.p  pA third approach I have not tried yet which I suspect will work just fine is to invoke a Servlet which would then serve up the zip package.  But seeing how I have a direct URL to the zip package, I was hoping there would be a way to serve that to the browser without getting a Servlet involved.p  pAny suggestions or approaches which would allow me to use the URL without invoking a Servlet are most welcome.  Of course, if Servlet is the only proper way of doing this, I will certainly do that.p  pThank you.p

Negative 3282 pProbably this cant be done, but in case Im missing somethingp  pIs it possible to temporarily modify the jQuery id selector so as to operate on say...a DocumentFragment, or an element removed from the DOM instead of the default behaviorp  pThe reason Im asking is that Im trying to optimize some legacy code that heavy utilizes id selectors in order to perform some heavylifting DOM manipulation. However, all those ids are under a single element. I read that if that element was removed from the dom, manipulated, and then inserted back performance would be much better. Which cant be done because of all those  selectors...p  pSidenote performance was noticeably improved by setting displaynone before the manipulation, but still slow.p

Negative 3282 pI am building application that consists of two main parts  p  ol liWeb application with rest API.li liMobile applicationandroid, iPhone.li ol  pWeb application has database that stores data about users like posts, events and similar.br Mobile application uses web applications rest api to access that data, but to do that I need some kind of authentication user must authenticate itself in order to accessmodify his data. p  pI know that could be easily done in such way that mobile application provides username and password in each request towards web api, and web application authenticates that username and password against database before serving request.br However, I would like to use oAuth so user can login using Google, Facebook, ... and this is where things get complicated, and I am not sure what is the best way to do this.p  pstrongMy first ideastrong mobile app sends oAuth provider for example Facebook credentials username and password to web app, which then authenticates them against oAuth provider. I soon realized that is not ok because that means user has to trust your site not to abuse given credentials, so this is not the way it is done. strongNot Goodstrongp  pstrongMy second ideastrong mobile app uses web application api to tell web app that it wants to authenticate against oAuth provider P. Web application redirects to provider P where user inputs his credentials. After that provider P redirects back to web application where user is logged in and JSON about successful login is sent to mobile app. This would be great if not for part where user has to input his credentials manually. I implemented this solution and problem is that, after mobile app accesses web app api JSON is not returned immediately but first redirects are done and that messes everything up. I was thinking about using webView inside mobile app, but I dont know how to return from webView when JSON is to be sent. I am not sure if I should pursue this idea further or this is wrong way of doing it strongMaybe good if some problems were solvedstrongp  pstrongMy third ideastrong Mobile app authenticates directly against oAuth provider P. If that was successful then mobile app sends requests to web app containing user information for example userId, or user password so web app knows which user it is. However this means that web app has to trust mobile app that given user is really authenticated. That means web app needs to be sure that api is accessed from mobile app. I could do that by hardcoding a special passwordsecret in mobile app which is sent with each request to prove that request was sent by mobile app.br Bad side of this approach is that I have to implement mobile app authentication against oAuth provider for each combination of mobile OS, oAuth provider. Also I am not sure how secure is it. Do you think this is a good way to go, what could I improvechange I have a feeling I am missing something. strongMaybe good, but has many work to dostrongp  pPlease tell me what idea is best and if there is any way to improve them, thanksp

Well, of course, but those fields arent suppose to be overridden anyway, the View isnt editing them.p  pHere is my Post Functionp  precode[HttpPost]     public ActionResult EditStore storeModel          if ModelState.IsValid              Store storeContext  database.Stores.FindstoreModel.ID             database.EntrystoreContext.CurrentValues.SetValuesstoreModel             database.SaveChanges               codepre  pSearching online, apparently the problem is that MVC doesnt know which fields you are editing and just treat every field as edited as far as its concerned, even if the field doesnt exist in the postback.  To tell which field you are editing in the View, you have to do thisp  precode            Store contextStore  new Store  ID  postBackStore.ID              database.Stores.AttachcontextStore              contextStore .Name  postBackStore.Name             contextStore .Address  postBackStore.Address             contextStore .City  postBackStore.City             contextStore .Postal  postBackStore.Postal             contextStore .Phone  postBackStore.Phone             contextStore .StoreNumber  postBackStore.StoreNumber             contextStore .IsActive  postBackStore.IsActive             database.EntrycontextStore.State  EntityState.Modified codepre  pHowever, this didnt work for me because MVC complain that it is already tracking the Store object and cant create a new one with the same ID.  Also, I dont like how I have to define all the fields again when I already defined them in the View.p  pstrongIs there anyway I can have MVC save change to only the fields in View as oppose to every field in the model without having to define explicitly which fields are in the Viewstrongp

Negative 3282 pI created a SVG groupobject and appended rectangle and foreignObjectSVG element containing HTML text.

If I use p  precoded3.selectgroup.transition codepre  pI can see the xcoordinates of the group changing but the elements inside the group do not move.

However the CGImages are not being released and the number of CGImages living is in the high 400s and 0 Transitory.p  pstrongScreenshot showing allocationsstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4gY4S.png altAllocationsp  pEDIT Previously I had been recycling and reusing GTGImageScrollerPageView instances in the ScrollView as is the common pattern for scrollviews like this. In order to simplify while trying to debug this problem I allow the entire GTGImageScrollerPageView to be deallocated after it has been displayed in the ScrollView. As you can see in the second image above, there are only 4 GTGImageScrollerPageView living and 377 transitory, there are also 388 UIImageViews and 389 UIIMages listed as transitory so it appears that the UIImageViews and UIImages are being deallocated fine.p  pIf I manually release the CGImage with CGImageRelease Commented out in the code below the CGImages are released. I know that I should not do this because I do not own the CGImage but this is useful to verify that this is where the problem is occurring. The screenshots below show the same code tested in Instruments but with CGImageRelease uncommented.p  pstrongScreenshot showing virtual memory usage with CGImageRelease usedstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQ6q66.png altVirtual memory usagep  pstrongScreenshot showing allocations with CGImageRelease usedstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwYnDl.png altenter image description herep  pIn the profiling outputs where CGImageRelease is used, you can see that the correct number of CGImage objects are Living and Transitory and that memory does not grow unbounded. Furthermore the app does not crash during usage with CGImageRelease used.p  pIf this were some system caching of CGImage then it should release the memory when a memory warning is raised, but it doesnt. Memory just continues to grow.p  pWhat here could be causing this unbounded growth in memory p  pstrongHere is the code for the page viewstrongp  pEDIT In response to comments I have updated the code to simplify further thus eliminating distractions such as ivars and properties that are not needed to demonstrate the problem. The problem remains unchanged and the results are the same when profiling. I have also added in the NSLog which also outputs the thread. I do see the dealloc being called as expected on the GTGImageScrollerPageView and it is always thread 1 and the call to displayAspectThumbImage is always on thread 1. p  pI really dont believe that there is anything wrong with the code that is presented here and this is confirmed by the generous effort of Rob. Something else is causing this but all the code related to loading and displaying the image is here there is no other code in effect here. The only other notable thing that I could think of raising is that the displayAspectThumbImage method is called from scrollViewDidScroll and scrollViewDidEndDecellerating methods of the scrollview delegate but the fact that the methods are called on the main thread should exclude autorelease issues due to being run on another thread.p  pI have checked and NSZombies is not enabled and there are no Zombies increasing my memory usage. Indeed when the CGImageRelease method is called the memory usage is pretty flat as can be seen in the screenshot above.p  precodeimplementation GTGImageScrollerPageView   voiddealloc       NSLogs , PRETTYFUNCTION, [NSThread currentThread]         voiddisplayAspectThumbImageNSString path         NSLogs , PRETTYFUNCTION, [NSThread currentThread]        UIImageView imageView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrameself.bounds]       [self addSubviewimageView]        UIImage image  [[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFilepath]       [imageView setImageimage]        If uncommented CGImages are disposed correctly       CGImageRelease[imageView.image CGImage]     end codepre  pstrongTested onstrongp  piOS 6.1.4p  piOS 5.0.1p

Negative 3282 pI am working on a website that has a content division that gets loaded dynamically by clicking on links in a navigation bar. The links are bound to codejQuery.loadltsome HTML pagegtcode.p  pOne of my pages that loads into this content window is having a problem.

If it gets near the end it loads more images. And so on... p  pNow, if I view the page for this dynamically loaded gallery on its own i.e. manually typing in the URL for the page, everything works fine. However, when I view it the intended way by clicking on the link and having it loaded into the existing page via a call to jQuery.load then it doesnt work properly. p  pThe problem seems to be that the math in the javascript is based on the sizes of HTML containers that are defined in CSS. I was able to confirm this by doing some testing and moving around my CSS code references with the following resultsp  ul liWhen explicitly loading codephotos.htmlcode in a browser it only works if the CSS file is loaded BEFORE the javascript file. li liWhen viewing the page by loading the content with jQuery.load it works if the codescrollingwindowcode is styled like codeltdiv idscrollingwindow styleheight150pxgtcodeli liWhen viewing the page by loading the content with jQuery.load it works if the CSS file is loaded on the main page codeindex.htmlcode. li ul  pIn other words, it seems the CSS file must be loaded before the javascript is executed...p  pSo, my question is...

Negative 3282 pWe have recently transitioned from Gemini to TFS for application change control. There is one aspect of TFS I cant get my head around  the lack of a builtin concept of emthe application version that each work item will be addressed inem. p  pIn Gemini every feature request, enhancement, bug etc can be tagged with a version number. If the field was left blank, the item was unscheduled, i.e. on the backlog. Each version could be flagged as either released or not. Reports could be then created listing the issues addressed in each released version, i.e. release notes, and the issues to be addressed in future versions, i.e. a roadmap. I was completely happy with thisp  pNow in TFS I cant find any builtin concept of version. It seems like there are 2 ways to represent versionp  pemAs a parent item in the iteration treeem, e.g.p  pVersion 1.0.0p  ul liSprint 1li liSprint 2li lietcli ul  pVersion 1.1.0p  ul liSprint 3li liSprint 4li lietcli ul  pemAs a parent item in the work items treeem, e.g.p  pVersion 1.0.0p  ul liRequirement 1li liRequirement 2li lietcli ul  pVersion 1.1.0p  ul liRequirement 3li liBug 4li lietcli ul  pThe latter approach looks better because it allows versions to be worked on simultaneously e.g. a major release will be worked on at the same time as bugfix release.p  pSo what is the recommended approach to managing work by versionp  pFinally, with the version property not actually being present in the work item itself, is it possible to make reports on issues addressed in each versionp
Negative 3282 pAs of some time now I have been very tempted to switch from bash to zsh. There is just one problem, I am very picky about my prompt. I use the terminal all day and it took me a long time to get my prompt to look and behave the way I want it to. By the way, I put it together from different sources and a bit of my own stuff and it may contain errors or not properly written code. All I want to know is if someone knows the code that I can paste into my zshrc that would give me the exact same prompt. p  pThe two features that I really enjoy is the variable length working directory that gets adjusted if pwd is too long and the directory separator slashes having different color then the dir names.

Negative 3282 pMy background is C. Ive started to work with Xamarin Studio on OS X to write an iOS app. Its a small app and I want to release for Android once finished with the iOS version.p  pIm attempting to use codeNSUserDefaultscode to store settings used in the app. My first pass was to use codeNSDictionarycode and save the dictionary. Xamarin documentation shows codeNSDictionarycode inherits from codeIDictionarycode and codeIDictionaryltNSObject, NSObjectgtcode.p  pIs it worth the effort to abstract out codeNSObjectcode in my repository class Then I would use native C types in my business logic but give my repositorymodel the ability to convert tofrom codeNSObjectcode when loading and saving data.p  pBack to my first paragraph about codeIDictionarycode, should I make the repository convert tofrom codeIDictionaryltNSObject, NSObjectgtcode but use codeIDictionaryltstring, stringgtcode throughout the rest of the codebase I have a feeling I will be fighting an uphill battle if I attempt this strategy.p  pIm slightly scatterbrain at this point, so new to the platform Im not sure what questions to ask yet. Perhaps a way to sum up my confusion is when should I be using native C types and when should I be using NS typesp

When I do this, its as if the Adjusts Scroll View Insets flag is unchecked, the scroll bar and the content go behind the top and bottom bars all the time.p  pIt doesnt matter if I put the view in the storyboard, or do it programaticaly in ViewDidLoad, or ViewWillAppear, or if I put it in at a higher point in the story board and then move it to the back programatically, I get the same result, the scroll does not adjusts for the bars.p  pIf I load or move it in viewDidAppear then it works, but thats too late for my transitions, I need the view in the background by the time it begins to become visible.p  pI suspect this is a bug with ios7, are there any known workaroundsp

Negative 3282 pI am working with hardware that is in the process of being developed. The board uses a TI CC2541 as the bluetooth chip. p  pPrior to a test the board is discoverable by two devices and I am able to connect to the board and perform a test where I write and read characteristics GATT. I perform the test again, everything goes fine until I reconnect to the device and attempt to discover its services. At that point, the board is offline and neither lightblue nor my own app can detect the device. I did a factory reset on one of the iOS devices iPads and it is still unable to recognize the board. p  pShould a factory reset remove all corebluetooth caching that has happened on the device, allowing iOS to recache and rediscover the board p  pCan this possibly be a corebluetooth problem or a problem with my app p

Although it is   accepted, this case is no more secure than not using the sandbox   attribute.p blockquote  pHowever, changing the attribute in the parent does not successfully trigger sandboxing as that would imply in the child.p  precodedocument.getElementByIdmyFrame.setAttributesandbox, allowscripts codepre  pThe page loaded in that iFrame can successfully gain access to the parent, which would not be the case if sandboxing was working.

Negative 3282 pWe have a problem with using of HeapCreateHeapAlloc for big allocations  512Kp  pWe are developing a C server application performing some image processing operations concurrently on a few images. It should work for a long time without restarting.p  pOur processing model is quite specific. Server starts, performs some required analysis in order to detect max. number of concurrent images for the given hardware configuration, meaning stable working with best performance, quickly reaches the max loading and then works more or less with the same high loading most of the time, depending on input queue.p  pThat means we utilize all required memory at the beginning and total amount of memory should not grow if everything is fine. Our pain is fragmentation. Size of incoming images may vary from 400K to possibly 50M and processing of each one leads to corresponding proportional to image size relatively big OPENCV allocations. Processing scenarios and related allocations vary, depends on image specifics, allocfree actions are very intensive, then after some time we get fragmentation. Some local optimizations were developed given negligible improvements. Actually we have outofmemoryfragmentation related effects after approx. 5000070000 images which is not so acceptable. Current solution is restarting of the server, which is far from be ideal.p  pInitial naive proposal to solve the problem wasp  ul liWe have own custom heap committing initially the whole required memory.li liAll required big OPENCV allocations and ONLY those redirected to this heapli liAt the moment, fragmentation arrives, we stop new input and finish all running jobs.li liThat means all image related allocations are released. li liCheck the heap and clean it if required due to memory leaks, for exampleli liNow, we have absolutely empty heap and can start from scratch. Open input again.li ul  pSimple proofofconcept project quickly figured out the followingp  ul liHeapCreate, committing initially 250M, grows by 10M each time I call HeapAlloc from it Strange, isnt itli liAs was recognized using HeapWalk, the committed memory was reserved not in one continuous block, but as a list of more than 500 chunks of 512K each. So none of them was suitable for my 10M request and heap called to process uncommitted memory li ul  pIt seems Win32 Custom Heap is optimized for small allocations only and I was unable to find a way to use it for my needs  VirtualAlloc seems to be a solution, but its very lowlevel API and using it means developing of my own memorymanagement system, seems some kind of wheel reinvention.p  pI want to believe some standard way exists and I just cannot find it. Any help or relevant resources to read will be much appreciatedp

Negative 3282 pIve been looking for the answer to this question for some time now and I find mixed answers. Are cron jobs heavy and expensive processes that consume a lot of resources  Or are they basically hits to that page regardless of the script that executes when cron triggers itp  pI intend to use several cron jobs for several sites. Lets say I have 3 cron different cron jobs thatll hit certain pages every minute for 10 sites. Does anyone have 10s or 100s of cron jobs like this in a triggering manner much like a browser hit wget...devnull 2amp1  If you do, do you experience additional load p  pFurther explanation as you might know, WPcron events do not take place if noone visits the WordPress site at the time of the scheduled event, until after someone comes along and triggers it. I have some not very active WordPress sites that I plan to carry out scheduled events and I am trying to get it right.p  pWhat do you think of the online cron services  Do they exist just because most shared users are not allowed to create cron jobs  Or is it because cron jobs slow the server down and this way you can take some load off your server p

Negative 3282 pIm having a little trouble understanding how InstallShield treats upgrades.p  pWhat I want is to be able to increment the version number on the installer, recompile, and distribute my installer. This should automatically remove any previous version of the application, and install the latest version and it should be presented to the user as an upgrade.p  pThis is a very straightforward installer, it just takes output from a few Visual Studio projects an application EXE, some DLLs and so forth and installs them all into Program Files. There is only one feature and it is always installed.p  pI dont want to change the upgrade code of the product because I would then have to create new upgrade paths one for each previous version, which is messy.p  pIve tried this before incrementing the version number, but not changing either the Product Code or the Upgrade Code, but each time I do, when I run the installer to upgrade the product, it says Resuming the wizard for [ProductName], and sometimes some of the files are not replaced with their newer counterparts from the newer installer.p  pI am not incrementing the revision number of the version number. I know thats ignored. Typically, I will try something like code2.0.3 gt 2.0.4code.p  pHow can I set up InstallShield so that it automatically removes any previous versions, installs the newest version, and presents this to the user as an Upgrade or Update if they already have a previous version installed If not, it should install like normal an Install, not an Update.p  pIm using InstallShield 2013 Pro Version 20 SP1, and I stick to using the InstallShield Editor within Visual Studio 2010.p

Negative 3282 pI wrote a C program that is supposed to create a certain number of child processes, each child process having to change 1 letter from a string. The string and the number of child processes are read from the keyboard.p  pFor example p  pinput p  precode3 Apples   codepre  poutput p  precodeApplex Appldx Apqldx codepre  pMy problem is Only the parent changes a letter and the children dont. Unsure what Im doing wrong. Help would be much appreciated, thanks in advancep  pEDIT I feel i wasnt clear enough. I want to do it using pipes. It should work like this The parent changes one letter, then the first child takes the string modified by the parent and changes one more letter. The second child takes the string modified by the first one 2 letters are already changed and changes one more and so on. I am new to C and am not quite sure how it all works, especially pipes. Also can the children be linked between them through the pipe, or can the only linked to the parent and it has to be something like first child changes a letter, gives the string back to the parent and then the second child reads from there, modifies letter and gives back. If its like that, is there any way to make sure that this doesnt happen Apples becomes AppleD and then AppleX and then AppleQp  pHeres my codep  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt includeltstring.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt includeltsystypes.hgt includeltunistd.hgt include ltsyswait.hgt   void errorchar msg  fprintfstderr, sn, msg exit1   static void modifychar msg[]      srandtimeNULL     int pos1randintstrlenmsg     srandtimeNULL     int pos2rand26     srandtimeNULL     int bigrand2     ifbig1          msg[pos1]charintApos2          else          msg[pos1]charintapos2          return   int mainint argc, char argv[]  ifargc3      errorWrong number of argumentsn  int nrch nrchatoiargv[1] char msgargv[2]  printfParent erhalten sn, msg int i0 modifyargv[2] printfParent weiter sn, msg srandtimeNULL pidt pids[10] int fd[2]   Start children.  for i  0 i lt nrch i      if pipefd  1          errorCant create the pipe          if pids[i]  fork lt 0              errorCant fork process           else if pids[i]  0          dup2fd[1], 1         closefd[0]         printfchildd erhalten sn, i1, msg             modifymsg         printfchildd weiter sn, i1, msg             exit0         Wait for children to exit.  int status pidt pid while nrch gt 0      pid  waitampstatus     printfChild with PID ld exited with status 0xx.n, longpid, status     nrch        codepre

Negative 3282 pI am a beginner who is currently learning C. I just had a quick question. If I place an include statement such as, codeinclude ltvectorgtcode in a header file do I still need to declare the same statement in the source file that implements the header file  My first thought is no because the header file has it included shouldnt the source file, that includes the header, have access to all the include calls that the header has. Sorry if the question is kind of confusing and possibly wrong terminology. Thank you.p

Negative 3282 pI suspect the answer is no, but Ill ask anyway...p  pstrongTLDRstrongp  pI know I can exclude a class or method from coverage analysis with the code[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]code attribute, but strongis there a way to exclude only empartem of a methodstrongp  pstrongConcrete examplestrongp  pI have a method that lazily generates a sequence of codeint.MaxValuecode elementsp  precodeprivate static IEnumerableltTElementgt GenerateIteratorltTElementgtFuncltint, TElementgt generator      for int i  0 i lt int.MaxValue i              yield return generatori       codepre  pIn practice, its never fully enumerated, so the end of the method is never reached. Because of that, DotCover considers that 20 of the method is not covered, and it highlights the closing brace as uncovered which corresponds to codereturn falsecode in the generated codeMoveNextcode method.p  pI could write a test that consumes the whole sequence, but it takes a very long time to run, especially with coverage enabled.p  pSo Id like to find a way to tell DotCover that the very last instruction doesnt need to be covered.p  pNote I know I dont really need to have emallem the code covered by unit tests some pieces of code cant or dont need to be tested, and I usually exclude those with the code[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]code attribute.

What I desire this button to do, is, once touched, is to kind of bring up a toast window, displaying my desired help information. p  pI think you can picture the functionality Im taking about, just from user experience But I cannot seem to find a great way of doing this, the way Im imagining. p  pNow, if there is already a clear example of this somewhere that you know of, a link would be fantastic, if not, some code with some explanation would be fantastic. I am new to java and android development, but Im getting there, slowly but surely. p  pThank you very much, once again for any help, or tips   p

Negative 3282 pHello  I am working on a project where I am going to have divisions from a league listed as buttons on a page.  And when you click on a button a different team list shows for each division.  All divisions and teams are stored in a mysql database and are linked together by the divid.  The plan was have the buttons use javascript or Jquery to send the divid to a function which would then use ajax to access an external php file and then look up all the teams for that division using the divid and print them on the page. I have been piecing this all together and getting the various pieces to work.  But when I put it all together it seems like the ajax part  does not pull in fresh data from the database if the data is changed.  In fact, if I change the PHP file to echo some more data or something, it keeps using the original unaltered file.  So, if the data is changed that is not updated, and if the file is changed that is not updated.  I did find if I actually copied the file with a new name and then had my ajax call use that file instead it would run it with new code and the new data at that time. But then everything is now locked in at that point and cannot get any changes.p  pSo  I do not know much about ajax and trying to do this.  I am not sure if this is totally normal for what I am using and for a dynamic changing team list, it cannot be done this way with ajax calling a PHP file.  p  pOR  maybe there is something wrong with the ajax code and file I have which is making it behave this way  I will paste in the code of my ajax code and also the php filep  phere is the ajax callp  precodevar answer  DivId .ajax type GET, url  pathtofilegscript2.php, data answer  answer, success functionresponse      ajaxcontent.htmlresponse   codepre  pand here is the script.php file that it calls removed db credentialsp  precodeltphp if emptySERVER[HTTPXREQUESTEDWITH]      ampamp strtolowerSERVER[HTTPXREQUESTEDWITH]  xmlhttprequest        AJAX request     answer  GET[answer]     dividanswer      echo div id is  . divid . ltbrgt     mysqlconnecthostname,username, password OR DIE Unable to connect to database       Please try again later. mysqlselectdbdbname  resultg1  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM teams WHERE dividdivid  whilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresultg1, MYSQLBOTH  teamidrow[teamid] teamnamerow[teamname] echo teamid .   . teamname . ltbrgt     gt codepre  pSo  to sum up  is there something wrong with this making it do this  Or is what it is doing totally normal and I have to find a different way  p  pThanks so much...p

Negative 3282 pI have a question regarding Java regular expressions and capture groups. My goal is to parse a log file and extract relevant fields into QRadar. I am not exactly writing Java code however since QRadar uses Java regular expressions to parse the log file and since my question is a regular expression problem I am posting it here in hope of getting some pointerssolution to my problem. p  pHere goes my question p  pI am trying to parse a log file that is a CEF Common Event Format formatted log file. Following are a couple of lines from the log file p  precode[blah, blah...] cs1DataValue1 cs2DataValue2  [blah, blah...] cs2DataValue3 cs1DataValue4 codepre  pMy goal is to extract the data values for the fields codecs1code and codecs2code from the above lines. So I am interested in capturing the values  codeDataValue1code, codeDataValue2code, codeDataValue3code and codeDataValue4code from the above linesp  pI came up with the following regular expressions for accomplishing the same  p  pRegEx for cs1 field  codescs1.swcodep  pRegEx for cs2 field  codescs2.swcodep  pUsing the above regular expressions and capture group I am able to capture the data values. But only in certain cases. So if you look at the log entries above you will notice that the order of the fields codecs1code and codecs2code within the log entry is not fixed. So at times the codecs1code field appears before codecs2code in the middle of log entry and at other times the field codecs1code appears at the end is the last field of the log entry. Similar behavior exists with codecs2code field as well. Using my current regular expression only works when the field is not the last field. p  pE.g. for the 1st log entry line  code[blah, blah...] cs1DataValue1 cs2DataValue2code, my regular expressions correctly parseextract the value of the codecs1code field but they fail for the codecs2code field since codecs2code field is at the end of the line. p  pSimilarly, for the 2nd log entry line code[blah, blah...] cs2DataValue3 cs1DataValue4code, my regular expressions correctly parseextract the value of codecs2code field but they fail to extract the value for the codecs1code field since codecs1code field is at the end of the line.p  pMy question is  What should my regular expression be so that it can parseextract the data field value correctly irrespective of whether the field appears in the middle or at the end of the log file entryp  pAny help is appreciatedp  pRegards,p  pP.S. In case anyone is interested I posted this question on the QRadar forum as well a hrefhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkscommunityforumshtmltopicidf48bc2dc2ccb42dfb543dc0522491fad relnofollowhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkscommunityforumshtmltopicidf48bc2dc2ccb42dfb543dc0522491fada but no luck yet with any responses...p

Negative 3282 pI have a .net webform NewShift.ascx file. It provides you an interface to add information about a new shift youll be working or just worked. So things like how many hours you worked, your shift manager, etc. In my code behind Id like to change the date created labels text to be the current date DateTime.Now if and only if its before 5pm today, otherwise make the date read tomorrow for reasons I wont go into.p  pIn addition, I might want to format the date a certain way based upon the user for example if theyre associated w one culture vs. another as per settings saved in the database, not the current country they are browsing the site in.p  pYou could argue because its such simple logic, I could just write it out in the code behind, but lets say I had a lot of these little simple things going on changing values, formatting dates, displaying values based on logic, etc.p  pMy understanding is this would be the smart UI antipattern if I did all of this in the code behind. Where should the above logic be p  pI hear about not having an anemic domain model and making sure my entities can provide functionality for answering domainspecific questions . I also hear about leveraging service layers as much as possible for things as well.p  pSo if I had to do the followingp  ol liChange a labels text to either today, or tomorrow, based on X and Yli liAdd two values together and assign a label text to that sum based on a user preferenceli liconditionally hide a checkbox based upon the day of the weekli ol  pWhere should logic like this be On the Shift object Or some sort of shiftServicep  pThanksp
Negative 3282 pIm creating a web app which has an interactive background with particles bouncing around. At all times there are about 200 circular particles on the screen and at most around 800 particles.

The problem Im having is cycling through the lists of data that the dot is plotted with, or rather, when I cycle through the list the plot is not being updated.p  pWhat Im trying to make is a slider scale which upon pressing left or right reads a new position in the list, and plots the dot.p  pIve triedp  ul lipPutting the plot inside a function, making a callback for each time the slider is affected.

Negative 3282 pIm playing around with OpenCL, Geforce GTX550 and driver version 331.38 from Ubuntu 14.04. What stumps me is the speed of copying from global to local memory. As far as I know, the following code should do coalesced access to global memoryp  precodevoid toLocallocal float target, const global float source, int count      const int iterations  count  getlocalsize0  1  getlocalsize0     for int i  0 i lt iterations i          int idx  i  getlocalsize0  getlocalid0         if idx lt count             target[idx]  source[idx]       codepre  pIn practice, the following code which should use all threads to copy the same float over and over again is measurably fasterp  precodevoid toLocallocal float target, const global float source, int count      for int i  0 i lt count i         target[i]  source[i]  codepre  pBoth source and target point directly at the beginning of a buffer, so I would guess they are correctly aligned. Group size is 16 by 16, trying to use all threads makes the code more complex but doesnt affect speed. The optimal coalescing group size would be 128 bytes or 32 floats, but as far as I know, on compute model 2 cards which GTX550 is the penalty of using only a part or even permuting the elements shouldnt be that bad. Adding local memory fence to the first version makes it only slower. Is there anything else I missedp  pEDIT Changing group size to 32 by 32 made the parallel version roughly as fast as sequential 16 by 16 and made the sequential version slightly slower. Still not the speed improvement I was expecting.p

Negative 3282 pI have designed a system and have to do now analysis using queueing models with which I have problems. First, I will briefly explain my system.p  pI have a clientserverdatabase system. There are N clients in the system. The clients can send requests messages 2 servers. The servers are running on another machine. Each client is associated with one server. For each request from a client, the server contacts the database. The database is also running on another machine. There is only one single database. p  pEach server itself consists of a socket thread, a queue, worker thread pool and database conection pool. The socket thread waits for connections from a client and then puts the new connection onto the queue. A worker thread takes the connection from the queue and acquires a connection from the connection pool and makes a database call. At the end, the worker thread send a message back to the client, closes the connection and waits for another job connection to process on the queue.p  pIt is a closed system.p  pSo far so good, now I have to do a MM1 and MMm model for the whole system as well as a MMm model for each component database and server.p  h21. MM1h2  pI have done a profiling of the system, i.e. I have now the time in microsecond a request spends in client processing, network, socket thread, queue, worker thread and database.p  pstrongIf I model the whole system as one MM1 queue, is it right to calculate the service time service rate of the whole model as the sum of the above profiled values divided by twostrong I think that I have to divide it by two because I have two servers. If I do not divide it by two I get traffic intensities utilization  1 but with divison by two it matches pretty well.p  h22. MMmh2  pI have to model the whole system as a MMm model. Im not sure what values to take for m and for the service times service rates.p  pIs it valid to take m as the number of worker threads andor the number of connections in the connection pool Or as the sum of bothp  pShould I take as the service time service rate just the service time for the worker thread or the database time or the sum of all the profiled values abovep  h23. MMm for serverh2  pIm not sure how to model the server separately with a MMm model. I think m should be equal the number of worker threads, right But how should I choose the service time service rate Just the service time for a worker thread or again the sum of all profiled values abovep  pstrongThank you so much for the help.strongp

Negative 3282 pMy understanding of postDigest is that its an opportunity to fire a callback after the current digest cycle has finished  without causing a new digest cycle in the process.p  pHowever, does that mean that all DOM effects caused by the current digest cycle are visible to the callback in the postDigest. p  pGiven the pseudo code belowp  precode  some code affecting the width of an element and triggering a digest loop   myModel.width  10 bound back to dom element with id  myId     postDigestfunction     some callback running after the most recent digest loop       gets the width of a DOM element by reading the value directly from the DOM element          that was changed in the previous digest loop     var width  myId.width     Will width always be 10 here    codepre  pLets assume a bound value in the current digest loop causes the width of a DOM element to change. Then, in postDigest I fire a callback with some legacy code that reads the changed width from the DOM element directly. Is it safe to read the value from the DOM element in the postDigest since its supposed to happen after the digest cycle has finished. In other words should the browser be done rendering the effects of the digest cycle by the time the postDigest runs p  pI am not a fan of this pattern, but have to integrate with some non angular code p

Negative 3282 pI am using ServiceStack.Ormlite against a number of Sql Server tables. At application runtime I need to lookup in some of these tables large amounts of data and am using the Sql.In approach. These IN lists can sometimes be between 50K and 100K items. The field searched on is indexed.p  pI have noticed that Ormlite doesnt do well when there are a lot of items in the IN list. Is this a limitation in Sql Server or Ormlitep  pA workaround which I hope to not do much longer is to directly build the sql and then join it on a IdList which is a user type in the database. This actually works fairly quick but does require me to create a bunch more code than if Sql.In worked in Ormlite.p  precodeCREATE TYPE [dbo].[BigIDList] AS TABLE     [Id] [bigint] NULL  codepre

Negative 3282 pIve noticed that other browsers, such as Firefox and IE, save form information on a input elementbyinput element basis, even on forms that are blocked by Javascript. For instance, if I were to type in a last name into an input and used Javascript to prevent the form submission and instead process the form in Javascript, both IE and Firefox would remember the text for the next visit to the page.p  pChrome has a similar form element memory Im not calling it autocomplete because its not really the same but it only saves the value when you actually submit the form. If you prevent the form submission and instead perform some other task in Javascript, such as executing an Angular directive, then Chrome doesnt save the form element value for the next visit.p  pHow do I get forms to save the input again, not autocomplete when the form never really gets submittedp  precodelt enter a last name, then hit submit, then wait for refresh,     then type the first letter of the last name again.

Then, the GROUP BY and SUMs aggregate this data to the month.p  pThis works.p  pI need to scale ProductSales by a factor, so I have build a subquery that contains a unique row for each MonthDate with the scaling factor.

It instead calculates much larger SUMs than the original query.p  ol liWhy is this happeningli liHow can I fix it and maintain the existing aggregationsli ol  pI need the Factor to optionally adjust sales numbers in another context...p  pMany thanks for the help  let me know if I can clarify anythingp

Negative 3282 pI want to show a list of entities, filtered based on certain metadata, and once an entity selected, I want to get all data for that entity to show details over time. These are two different queries to crossfilter, and the question is, do I need two different Crossfilter instances for thatp  pDetailsp  pI have a dataset containing many rows of metadata per entities, over time, e.g.p  precode[id 0, time 0, p1 1, p2345, value 0,  id 0, time 1, p1 2, p2789, value 1,  id 1, time 0, p1 3, p2123, value 2,...] codepre  pFirst, I want to get all rows which fulfill certain criteria, lets say code.time1code and code.p1gt2code. These selections are made such that I get a list of emunique idsem. p  pNow I show all the entities to which those codeidcodes belong. If a user selects one of those, I want to get something different from my dataset All rows where code.id[selected id]code. p  pI know I can reset the filters on all dimensions, but Id also like to keep the previous settings active because a user might change the filters leading to the first selection after Ive done the second selection.p  pSo what I really want are two crossfilter instances probably. However, I am loading a emlotem of data and ideally I wouldnt want to keep the data around in two different crossfilter instances.p  pI guess my question is Does crossfilter duplicate the data when I load it into a Crossfilter instance And if it does, is there a way to maintain two different filtering states of it without having to duplicate the whole instancesp

Negative 3282 pI started developing a web application based on the a hrefquestionstaggedbottle classposttag titleshow questions tagged bottle reltagbottlea web framework a couple of years ago.  I chose Bottle at that time because it was the easiest solution to get up and running fast, and I was just working on building a prototype of an idea I had.  Now, I have several thousand lines of code, and Im looking to move into productionlevel solution.  p  pAt first I thought that I should move to a full stack framework such as a hrefquestionstaggeddjango classposttag titleshow questions tagged django reltagdjangoa or a hrefquestionstaggedweb2py classposttag titleshow questions tagged web2py reltagweb2pya.  As I was moving that direction, I started just using various parts of other frameworks as I needed them.  For example, I implemented web2pys data access layer DAL so that I could run my application on a hrefquestionstaggedgoogleappengine classposttag titleshow questions tagged googleappengine reltagimg srci.stack.imgur.comvobok.png height16 width18 alt classsponsortagimggoogleappenginea, and now Im looking to into using web2pys scheduler to manage jobs.  Then, I began to use a hrefquestionstaggedcherrypy classposttag titleshow questions tagged cherrypy reltagcherrypya as a productionlevel webserver.  I tried the rocket server, but I was getting more errors with it, so I preferred cherrypy over rocket.  p  pI started looking into rewrite my code to fully use web2pys full stack solution however, the amount of time to rewrite my routing functions to fully move into web2py seems to be significant, and I really wasnt happy with the rocket server.  p  pI really like the simplicity of Bottle, the way that Bottle uses decorator functions to map the routes to the functions, and also the philosophy of extensibility.  p  pemI want to know if there are any specific advantages in terms of performance in using Bottle to do routing, versus any of the full stack frameworks.emp  pI appreciate anyones advice on thisp

This field is based on calculation  p  ol lipQuery should first match strongcodeSerialNocodestrong from strongcodeDespatchcodestrong table for Lot 20 with strongcodeSerialNocodestrong under Lot 20 in strongcodeActivationcodestrong table. It finds 8 match ignoring Product1amp2 which have different Lot quantities. pli lipNext for 8 matched SerialNos it should compare date. If strongcodeDispatchDatecodestrong for a strongcodeSerialNocodestrong is less than strongcodeActivationDatecodestrong then it is count as 1.Product3s strongcodeDispatchDatecodestrong is greater than strongcodeActivationDatecodestrong. Hence it is ignored. For rest of the SerialNos strongcodeDispatchDatecodestrong is lt strongcodeActivationDatecodestrong. So total resultant count from strongcodeActivationcodestrong table is 7.pli lipFor unmatched SerialNos from strongcodeDespatchcodestrong table Product1,2 amp 3 it should perform a match in strongcodeReplacedcodestrong table. It finds match for all the SerialNos but as Product4 to Product10 are already matched from strongcodeActivationcodestrong, here it should match only 3 leftover SerialNosProduct1,2 amp 3. Product1 amp 2 matches here. Next similar to above it should check if strongcodeDispatchDatecodestrong is lt strongcodeRecordDatecodestrong. Both Product1 amp 2 have strongcodeDispatchDatecode lt codeRecordDatecodestrong so count from strongcodeReplacedcodestrong table is 2.pli liNow the total strongcodeInstalledcodestrong should be 9 7 from strongcodeActivationcodestrong table and 2 from strongcodeReplacedcodestrong table.li ol  pThere can be multiple entries of a strongcodeSerialNocodestrong from strongcodeDesptachcodestrong in both strongcodeReplacedcodestrong and strongcodeActivationcodestrong table as observed in above diagram . So first the match of SerialNos of strongcodeDespatchcodestrong table should be done with strongcodeActivationcodestrong table and if any of strongcodeSerialNocodestrong is unmatched or its strongcodeDispatchDatecode  codeActivationDatecodestrong only then for those SerialNos it should go ahead to find a match in strongcodeReplacedcodestrong table.p  pSo far with the help of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1175077jpw jpwa I have managed to form a query as below p  precodeselect      select distinct LOTQty     from Despatch     where LotQty  15 as LotQty  ,     select COUNTSerialNo     from Despatch     where LotQty  15 as ApprovedQty  ,     select distinctDispatchDate     from Despatch     where LotQty  15 as DispatchDate  ,     select COUNTA.SerialNo  countR.NewSerialNo     from Despatch D     left join         Activation A         on D.SerialNo  A.SerialNo         and D.DispatchDate lt A.ActivationDate         and D.LotQty  A.LotQty     left join         Replaced R         on D.SerialNo  R.NewSerialNo         and D.DispatchDate lt R.RecordDate as Installed codepre  pwhich yields wrong output i.e p  precodeLotQty  ApprovedQty  DispatchDate  Installed   15         10        201387       17 codepre  pHelp is deeply appreciated,  Thanks in advancep  pstrongEIDT1strongbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfzbF0.png altenter image description herep  pSo from above diagram even now the codeInstalledcode should be 9 as I would like result only for Lot15p

Negative 3282 pI want to create a 3dimensional model of a planet based on a dodecahedron and give each side a different texture representing the dominant landscape and other content of that area.

Negative 3282 pI have bed management module where by a client visits us and we assign a bed to the client. When we assign a bed to a client, the system starts a new episode by adding an entry into the episode table, the system also adds the start date of the visit in the episode table.

A client may come back and in that case the system starts a second episode in the Episode table and so on.... p  pA client can have multiple episodes and each episode will have 0 or 1 discharge record depending on whether client is discharged or still occupying a bed.p  pI need to write a query to receive all those episodesclients that exist i.e client occupied a bed during a specified 12 months period, and the second requirement is out of all the data that fulfilled the first querys requirement, I need to get all those clientsepisodes which reoccupied the bed within 6 months of their end date.p  pI have created a SQL fiddle to make it easier.p  pa hrefhttpwww.sqlfiddle.com6024f51 relnofollowSQL Fiddleap  pIf I run this query infor July 2007 then the start and end date of the 12 month period is 01012006  31122006.

Negative 3282 pI have a codeListViewcode that allows me to select items, which are then added to an codeObservableCollectioncode.  This codeObservableCollectioncode is bound to a codeTabControlcode, so I get new tabs as I add items.  What I would like is for each new tab to become selected and show its content automatically.  p  pFrom a content perspective, this is working.  I am able to see the newlyadded items content as expected, however from the looks of the codeTabControlcode itself, all tabs have been deselected, or moved to the background.p  pHeres what Im doing  Note that Im setting SelectedItem.  I experience similar results when setting SelectedIndex or SelectedValue.  Not sure whats best here.p  precodevoid MyCollectionCollectionChangedobject sender, NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e      if e.Action  NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add              ListltMyClassgt newStuff  e.NewItems.CastltMyClassgt.ToListltMyClassgt          if newStuff.Count  1             myTabControl.SelectedItem  newStuff[0]       codepre  pUsing codeConsole.WriteLinecode and the TabControls SelectionChanged event, I can verify that the codeTabControl.SelectedIndexcode is changing as expected.  With each new item however, all tabs appear to move to the background.  p  pI always see the content for the new item, but I must manually click the tab in order for it to visually appear as the foreground tab.p  pWhenever I click the background tab that is supposed to already be in the foreground, my console often displays a redundant debug message.  p  pFor example, if I start with zero items in the collection and then add one, I get one background tab, one console message, and I see the items content.  If I click on the tab, it comes to the foreground and the SelectionChanged method fires, repeating the same console message while I stare at the same item contentp  precodemyTabControl now has SelectedIndex of 0 myTabControl now has SelectedIndex of 0 codepre  pHow can I both programmatically show the content of my new tab, and see that tab as the foreground tab  p  pThe only way I can bring ANY tab to the foreground programmatically is by setting codemyTabControl.SelectedIndex  1code.  Apparently this is not an option while the codeObservableCollectioncode contains items, so this forces the codeTabControlcode to move the first tab content, header and all to the foreground.  What am I missing herep  pstrongCorrectionstrong  With this method setting codeSelectedItemcode I do get my very first tab in the foreground, however creating tab 2 and all subsequent tabs deselects all tabs, while showing the content from the most recent addition.p

Negative 3282 pI am trying to write an implementation for a 234 tree that adds students and sorts them by id number and Im having some trouble with the insertion. Ive ran through the debugger and it keeps overwriting my mroot whenever add is called in main after the first pass, and so it keeps saying that its inserting a duplicate when it enters the private Add function and therefore by the rest of the code, saying it fails to insert.

Negative 3282 pI need to find a query for getting values before nil.p  pIn my database I have table with column called tablenumber. Usually values are incremented by 1 in this table when ever specific actions are made in code, like thisp  precodeid, tablenumber 1   1  2   2 3   3 4   nil 5   nil 6   nil 7   nil 8   nil 9   nil 10  nil codepre  pbut now there is possibility that for specific record table number can be specified. So my question is how to keep incriminating values if there is already value specified. The scenario looks something like thisp  precodeid, tablenumber 1   1  2   2 3   3 4   nil 5   nil 6   nil 7   nil 8   nil 9   6 10  nil codepre  pSo right I guess thing here to do would be get all values that are not nil find one which are incremented by one and keep incriminating if the value is not specified. but how to do that, so table after all records have been filed looks like thisp  precodeid, tablenumber 1   1  2   2 3   3 4   4 5   5 6   7 7   8 8   9 9   6 10  10 codepre  pI am working on rails, but SQL would be fine too  Thank youp

Negative 3282 pI have a website that I need to convert to HTML5. I need advice and whether it can truly be converted to an HTML5.p  pPlease tell me, how I should start Should I just start using HTML5 code in lieu of existing HTML4. I will need to later add video content and a image scroller. Also if need be, should I redesign the site from scratch I dont think this should be a problem. Also the site is not friendly with form factors other than deskoplaptop. It does not work well with mobile small display for which case HTML5 is anyways needed.p  pDo not hesitate or think too much. I need to know what you guys have in mind before I take a major step. I need to do this in under a month, I cannot afford to waste anymore time on it.p  pI have used gimp to make the icons for this website, but i dont think much of those icons will be needed with the new code.p  pAlso, should I make a design prototype in gimp for my website. Later on I can add the csshtml5. Do you think its worth the extra time or should I use one of the ready made templatesp

Negative 3282 pIm trying to implement an interface where the user drills down through successive collection views of data, and would like to have each collection view animate to the next one as its pushed.  This has been very frustrating.p  pIve boiled it down to a very simple test case which I still cant get to work the way I think it ought to.  p  p1 A UINavigationController has a UICollectionViewController which is hardwired to return a numberOfSections  1, an itemsInSection  8, and the backgroundColor of the cells is set to redColor in cellForItemAtIndexPath.  The associated UICollectionViewFlowLayout.itemSize is set to 80, 80.p  p2  When a cell is selected I push a new UICollectionViewController which is hardwired to return a numberOfSections  1, an itemsInSection  30, and the backgroundColor of the cells is set to blueColor in cellForItemAtIndexPath.  The associated UICollectionViewFlowLayout.itemSize is set to 60, 60.p  pIf I push the second controller with its useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions property set to false, the controller slides in with the proper data display 30 blue cells.  If I set useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions to true before pushing, only the layout changes on push.  The 8 red cells from the first controller are still displayed, but their size changes to 60, 60.p  pApples UICollectionViewController class reference says that when you set useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions to true, the navigation controller performs an animated layout change between the contents of the two collection view controllers instead of the traditional push animation, but Im only getting the layout change.p  pMy test code is stupid simple, so not sure what I might be doing wrong here.  Does Apples class reference misrepresent what the expected behavior should be  Is there any reason to just change layouts when youve pushed a new controller and theoretically a new data source  Is there an alternative way to animate to the next collection viewp  pFor what its worth, here is the only code in my test program other than returning appropriate values for numberOfSections and numberOfItems, and setting appropriate cell background colors.  p  precodeoverride func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, didDeselectItemAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath       let itemSize  collectionViewLayout as UICollectionViewFlowLayout.itemSize     let theLayout  UICollectionViewFlowLayout     theLayout.itemSize  CGSizeMakeitemSize.width  20, itemSize.height  20      let toVC  SecondCollectionViewControllercollectionViewLayouttheLayout     toVC.useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions  true     navigationController.pushViewControllertoVC, animatedtrue  codepre

Negative 3282 pI am eventually fetching objects from my backend and I have to keep track of them. I need a collection where there are no duplicates, but every time I fetch the same object from the backend I get a new instance, so I must compare its String key manually, I suppose.p  pPlus, these objects need a boolean associated with them, because they may be in this list and be used and I should know that later.p  pA typical scenario is that I have a list of 10 objecst in my collection and I fetch 8 new ones, and only 3 are new. I should add these 3 to these list and discard the 5 repeated ones.p  pI am about to start implementing a custom Collection for that.

Negative 3282 pI have a project that uses an event hub to receive data, this is sent every second, the data is received by a website using SignalR, this is all working fine, i have been storing the data in to blob storage via a Stream Analytics Job, but this is really slow to access, and with the amount of data i am receiving off just 6 devices, it will get even slower as this increases, i need to access the data to display historical data on via graphs on the website, and then this is topped up with the live data coming in.p  pI dont really need to store the data every second, so thought about only storing it every 30 seconds instead, but into a SQL DB, what i am trying to do, is still receive the data every second but only store it every 30, i have tried a tumbling window, but from what i can see, this just dumps everything every 30 seconds instead of the single entries.p  pam i miss understanding the Tumbling, Sliding and Hopping windows, i am guessing i cannot use them in this way  if that is the case, i am guessing the only way to do it, would be to have the output db as an input, so i can cross reference the timestamp with the current time p  punless anyone has any other ideas  any help would be appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 3282 pIm having some issues with fullscreen video in the Edge browser on Windows 10. Currently my video elements are using the HTML5 video player, but I dont think thats the problem because two different video elements of mine that use the same video player produce different results when going into fullscreen, both with identical views MVC as well. Could this be a CSS issue Is there some sort of Microsoft Edge prefix Im not taking into consideration Im not really sure why one would work and not the other p  pHere is a screenshot of the fullscreen that I currently get with the broken video element. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commuEoH.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commuEoH.png altenter image description hereap  pThe red indicates the video, the white is just white and the black is just what is behind the video.

Negative 3282 pI have a NStableView which is NSView based. In each row also have a NSImageView which is subview of NSView. I have subclassed this NSImageView then overrided strongmouseDownstrong method. The problem is strongtableViewSelectionDidChangestrong is also getting fired when user clicks on this imageview. I want only strongmouseDownstrong to be called but not tableViewSelectionDidChange.p  pIf I set strongselectionHighlightStylestrong of table to strongNSTableViewSelectionHighlightStyle.Nonestrong then only strongmouseDownstrong of image view is called. And if I dont give strongselectionHighlightStylestrong to strongNSTableViewSelectionHighlightStyle.Nonestrong then both strongmouseDownstrong of imageview and strongtableViewSelectionDidChangestrong are getting called. Setting strongselectionHighlightStylestrong to none seems to solve my problem but is this correct approch Or I am getting this behaviour because of some bug in appkitp  pAlso I cant find this behaviour documented somewhere.p

Negative 3282 pIm working with a file type that is essentially just a zip file, the actually extension of it isnt a zip lets say its .foo, and when you rename test.foo to test.zip there is an index.xml file that contains lots of valuable information.p  pMy question is is there a way to convert the .foo file to a .zip, then open that zip and read the index.xml file I know you can parse it, but can I open it while its still in the .zipp  pI know this is possible on the server, but what Id like to do is read the xml, convert it to JSON all on the client side, then send the necessary information to the server, which would make the process a lot faster.p  pAny help or pointers would be great, thanksp
