Positive 3421 pRecently I have replaced my old website with a new one. On both of them I have Google Analytics attached. On the old site everything worked fine the reports with .html at the end.

Unfortunately the reports from the new page contain the domain name at the beginning, what makes them harder to read.

Positive 3421 pPreviously, we had implemented Traditional ecommerce analytics gaq using trackTrans, addItem, etc. We had several years of data in GA that correlated conversions with our Ad campaigns, based on UTM source, campaign, medium. p  pWhen switching over to Google Tag Manager, we did the following things  Removed the gaq code related to ecommerce transactions amp addItem  Kept the rest of the GA code related to page tracking, events, and custom variables  Implemented the Google Tag Manager javascript  a GTM data layer that included our new Ecommerce information Google Tag Manager data layerp  p Configured a Tag in GTM for Order Completed for Google Analytics, set to Universal Analytics Configured with our UA property identifier, etc.. Tag type Universal Analytics Tracking ID our GA environment, Track Type  Page View , Enable enhanced ecommerce feature  true, Use data layer  True Fire on Order completedp  pUpon switching over, we indeed see Ecommerce numbers come through, but theres something off about the recording of these conversions correctly back to the campaigns. It appears that while some are attributed back, not all conversions are counted correctly as being from the ad campaign they originated from.p  pWhat went wrong here After thorough reading of the GTM documentation, we were led to believe that it would just work but it appears that GTM and GA dont know how to communicate with each other regarding UTM information, and as a result GA tracks conversions but fails to attribute them to right session that is, ITS session information that contains the correct UTM for that user.p  pWe found a very scant amount of information about this on the internet but some people suggest setting all the UTMs are Variables in GTM, and then passing them as fields in the Tag firing back to GA. Is that necessary It seems like these two technologies should work together with less friction. p  pPlease advise. p

Positive 3421 pSponsored Data enables apps or users to access a predetermined URL free of charge over mobile networks, while the data traffic is charged to the entity who provides the service through the app or website.p  pHundreds of millions of users around the globe use sponsored services on a daily basis to access their bank accounts, use mgovernment services, buy through mcommerce and many other cases.p  pOne of the simplest implementation of Sponsored Data requires the sponsor to send the mobile carriers a list of sponsored URLs. The mobile carrier then sets its network and billing to behave in the proper way.p  pThis architecture present a challenge for the use of 3rd party APIs like google analytics for apps. The use of the app has an explicit promise of free usage but access to the analytics URL are charged by the mobile operator is it is not on the sponsor sponsored list.p  pAs the URLs for the google analytics servers are presumably the same for all app analytics clients, this a sponsor can decide to either a not use app analytics b sponsor the google apps servers URLs and pay the traffic for every single app that use the analytics not only his own app or c breach its promise of free usage and deliver an app whose data usage is only partially free.p  pTherefore, I would like to knowp  ol liis there a way to have google app analytics servers respond to a unique URLli liis there a way to implement google app analytics server side routing usage data to a server and then feeding the analytics engineli liis there any other way this that I am not seeingli ol  pBest regards,p  pOren Pinskyp

Negative 3421 pFirst off let me apologize to the SO community for coming to you with something that ought to be so trivial.  But Ive been at this all day and Im at the end of my rope.p  pThere is a section of my program that needs pull text from an input stream and an error stream from a process that is launched using Runtime.getrunTime.exec and pass it through to standard input and output in an orderly manner.  I have a function that near as I can tell should work.  But it seems to be getting caught in a catch22 where its waiting for the stream to report ready  but the stream has finished and is not reporting.  Im baffled. I cant think of another way to do this that fits my constraints and Im rather skeptical that such a catch22 can exist.  p  pHere is my codep  precodeprivate void forwardStreamtoStdInputStream in, InputStream err  throws IOException      int c  1     BufferedReader inReader  new BufferedReader         new InputStreamReaderin, USASCII     BufferedReader errReader  new BufferedReader         new InputStreamReadererr, USASCII     boolean inFinished  false, errFinished  false      try          System.out.printlnBegin stream read loop...         while inFinished ampamp errFinished          if inFinished              while inReader.ready                  if c  inReader.read  1                      inFinished  true                                   else                      System.out.printchar c                                                 if errFinished              while errReader.ready                  if c  errReader.read  1                      errFinished  true                                   else                       System.err.printchar c                                                         System.out.printlnEnd stream read loop.           catch IOException e          throw e           finally          errReader.close         inReader.close       codepre  pThe problem seems to be that the reading loops are waiting for the streams to report ready, and as a result arent seeing the 1 returned by read telling them that its time to quit.

Negative 3421 pI need to enable a .NET application to run over a network share, the problem is that this will be on clients network shares and so the path will not be identical. p  pIve had a quick look at ClickOnce and the publish options in Visual Studio 2008 but it needs a specific network share location  and Im assuming this location is stored somewhere when it does its thing. p  pAt the moment the job is being done with an old VB6 application and so gets around all these security issues, but that application is poorly written and almost impossible to maintain so it really needs to go. p  pIs it possible for the domain controller to be set up to allow this specific .NET application to execute Any other options would be welcomed as I want to get this little application is very business critical. p  pI ought to say that the client networks are schools, and thus are often quite locked down as are the client machines, so manually adding exceptions to each client machine is a big no no. p  hr  pApologies, I forgot to mention were restricted to .NET 2.0 for the moment, we are planning to upgrade this to 4.0 but that wont happen immediately. p

Negative 3421 blockquote   pVersioningbr   If your events changes you would create a new version of that event, and  keep the old ones. To keep your domain code form being bloated with handling of all versions of  events you would basically introduce a component that converts your events from previous  to newer versions, and then apply them on the domain. Remember that events are things that actually happened in your domain so in most cases the information in deprecated events are valuable.p blockquote  pI still havent found any example of this.p  pAny help  p

Negative 3421 pHello I am using willpaginte plugin on two objects on a same page. Like on stackoverflow. There is a profile page on which there is a pagination on two things  QUestions and answers.p  pI am having  problem ie when user is clicking on questions pagination page 2. answers page are also updating. The reason is both is sending a post variable ie p  precode  params[page] codepre  pHow to change this variable so that only one should be updated. and how to maintain that user should not lose the other page.p  piep  phe is on 3rd page of questions and 1st page of answers and now he click on 5th page of the questions the result should be 3rd page of questions and 5th page of answers.p
Negative 3421 pThe title of this question may be a bit misleading. I couldnt quite think of anything better.p  pHere is my problem. I am developing an Apache module that needs to manipulate a bit of content in the requested HTML document this document can be a file on the disk or may be dynamically generated by CGI or PHP and so I am using libxml2 with it.p  pI developed something working, but the problem is that when the browser requests for a page, lets sayp  pa hrefhttplocalhosta.html relnofollowhttplocalhosta.htmlap  pthe module does its job. But if that page has references to a javascript file, a.js, or a stylesheet file, a.css, they are not getting served.p  pThe reason as I perceived by examining the logs is that, as the browser sends requests for a javascript file lets sayp  blockquote   p[httplocalhosta.js]     putting [] because of limit of 1 url per post.p blockquote  pApache again runs my module, the module uses a HTML parser, so when the content is not HTML, it gives error and exits, the request is abandoned.p  pHow can I make my module to work only for texthtml requests p
Negative 3421 pComparison of HTML5 and Silverlight as Web development platform is a popular topic, and arguments often focus on readiness of HTML5 or additional step to install Silverlight plugin. But lets say there are no such issues all browsers have good support for HTML5, and all browsers come with builtin Silverlight. I know its false assumption, but it helps me focusing on something else with such assumption made, what would you choose for rich Web client development in a .NET development team p  pI believe one of the important factors then will be code writing experience how easy is to write clean code, how easy to maintain it over long period of time Do you have any experience with thisp

Negative 3421 pIve been working on a tool that creates a UI for authoring wxs files. Currently its simple code that uses LinqtoXMl queries to bind the UI to the XDocument and Im starting the process of refactoring it.p  pMy question is  Are there any classes already in WiX that provide useful functionality  For example something like enumerating a WiXDependencies collection to get back strongly typed information on module signature, language, version and then being able to addadd rangeremove and so on.    Basically Im looking to reuse or create an API that can handle all my interaction with the wxs file so my UI layer doesnt have to be aware of all the details.p  pIve been looking at the classes in the serialize namespace and I see they have interesting members and typically an OutputXml method but its not obvious to me how you would construct the class and read existing xml into it.p  pUpdate I do now see the CDR class but it only seems to read from a file on not any other sources.p

Negative 3421 pIm implementing a UITabBar in the middle of my navigation stack without  UITabBarController.  The UITabBar is in the codeDetailViewControllercode which delegate a portion of the screen to the view controller associated with the selected tab element.  Inside one of view controllers thats displayed via tab bar selection, theres a UIButton which needs to display a view modally.  I tried code[self presentModalViewControllermodalNavController animatedYES]code, but the new navigation bar was hidden underneath the nav bar of the parent controller, codeDetailViewControllercode.  So what I think I need to do is use the parents navigation controller to present the view modally so that the new nav bar is ON TOP of the codeDetailViewControllercode nav bar.  p  pI know its possible because I have an ad in the codeDetailViewControllercode, and tapping the add gives me the desired result, but I havent been able to incorporate that code.

Negative 3421 pHeres the situation.  I have a base class which implements a method that accepts a string, and sets a property to the value of that string.  Under that, I have a group of concrete classes that implement the base.  Some of the concrete classes can accept any string value to be stored.  However, some of the classs values are constrained within an Enumerated series of values.  The final value is still a string, but the value must be within that enumerated set of possible values.p  pHeres what Id like to do  For the classes which use an enumrestricted value, I want to implement an overload to the string method that calls the string method with the correct value.  However, I also want to lock the string implementation out so that only the enum implementation can be used to pass a new value in, in order to enforce the enum restriction.p  pI know at this point that this just isnt going to happen through the use of override or new in the method declaration.  I also know that I could create a hierarchy like Base  [BaseStringBaseEnum]  Concrete and use sealing to keep the concrete implementation from allowing the stringbased implementation to be used.  What Id like to know is if theres another way to do this that skips the extra level of hierarchy and allows me to just say If method overload is present in concrete class, lock method.p  precodepublic class Abstract      public virtual string ValueHolder  get privateprotected set      public virtual void DoSomething string s   ...    public class ConcreteEnum  Abstract      public void DoSomething Enum e            base.DoSomething String somehow extracted from enum        public class ConcreteString  Abstract  ...   public class Main      ConcreteString sc  new ConcreteString     ConcreteEnum se  new ConcreteEnum      sc.DoSomething I dont have an overload defined,          so Im using my bases string handler method.           I can be any value, I have no restrictions.       se.DoSomething SomeEnum.MyValueWillBeRunThroughTheBaseStringHandler      se.DoSomething I dont work because theres an         overload defined in my concrete class, and my         value is restricted to a specific set of         possibilities.   codepre  pAs I said, I know that there are other viable ways of doing this, I just want to know if this is possiblemore clean than those alternatives.p

Negative 3421 pAs the title suggests, I am getting a FileNotFoundException when running a web page ASP.NET MVC 2 project that references a Silverlight class library. When a method on one of the classes from the Silverlight library is called, I get the following errorp  blockquote   pCould not load file or assembly System.Xml.Linq, Version2.0.5.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.p blockquote  pOk, so a bit of an explanation about my setup. I have three projects one is a Silverlight class library using Silverlight 4 and the others are an ASP.NET MVC 2 web project, and a Silverlight project that has a Silverlight control that is hosted in the web project. I have referenced the Silverlight library in the web project and the Silverlight project the one with the control. Within the SL control, I instantiate a class from the SL library, and call one of the classs methods. That method contains calls to the System.Xml.Linq library classes. The FileNotFoundException occurs when calling that method, but not when instantiating the class.p  pDue to the nature of this project, I am unable to enclose any of the code I am using, but here is some arbitrary code to help illustrate the above explanationp  pstrongClass in Silverlight librarystrongp  precodepublic class XmlClass      public void Execute               Calls to System.Xml.Linq classes       codepre  pstrongSilverlight controlstrongp  precodepublic class SLControl  UserControl       ...      private void SomeObjectSomeEventobject sender, EventArgs e               Instantiate class         XmlClass xmlClass  new XmlClass           Execute         xmlClass.Execute            lt Error occurs here.       codepre  pNow the even weirder thing is I had this error at another point in the project. In this other point, I had a standard .NET class library referencing the SL library and using the same calls as the SL control. I hit the error in the same place, and worked out that when the code was run, it was trying to look in the GAC for the relevant System.Xml.Linq assembly. As such, I installed it into the GAC and this fixed my issue.p  pSo, Im a little bit lost now, since the assembly is still in the GAC and the project that originally had the issue still works. p  pAny ideas on thisp

Negative 3421 pHeres the end game... I need a wcf service application with usernamepassword security over ssl.  Pretty basic stuff, but Im at my wits end trying to make this work.  Im trying to implement the HOWTO guide from microsofts patterns and practices as listed herep  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc949025.aspx relnofollowHow to Use Username Authentication with Transport Security in WCF Calling from Windows Formsa.p  pIve follwed each of the steps exactly... except steps 9  12.  Those steps implement a custom authentication and authorization class.  Im having errors both with the implmentation of these custom classes and without.p  pFirst, without the custom classes...  Without the custom authorization and authentication I can compile my wcf project and create the service reference in the console client application.  When I run my console application it works, but when I decorate my wcf method to restrict the permissions, it appears that the client is never passing the credentials to the wcf service.  If it leave the decoration off the method and step trace into the wcf method, if find that the ServiceSecurityContext.Current.PrimaryIdentity.Name is blank.  Im decorating with     [PrincipalPermissionSecurityAction.Demand, Role  sysadmin] and yes, Ive used the ASP.net configuration to create the role and the account in that role.p  pSecond, with the custom classes... If I include the HttpModules element as listed in step 10, I get an error stating that IIS express 7.5 doesnt do it this way any more and I need to move the configuration.  With a little bit of hunting I found that I needed to move the item to .  But it still complains that is cant reference the module.  If I leave out the authentication module and try to just reference the authorization module, I get the same error.p  pI tried to include the entire web.config, but this editor didnt want to take it all.  Suffice it to say that its exactly like the msdn article except for moving the module tag.p

Negative 3421 pI am building a middle size system and I am facing a problem that probably some of you have faced before. In my business layer I return business objects with a subset of properties that are important for that business method, I am worried because I can end up with to much objects with meaningless names or only one where only a subset of properties are filled in a given method. Let me put an example.p  pstrongCase 1strongp  pFor example, a user belongs to a city, which in turns belongs to a state and a country, codeUsercode, codeCitycode, codeStatecode and codeCountrycode are tables on my database with a lot of fields, but I want a list of users with a list of Orders, so I create a business object called for example codeUserWithOtherscode with only the important properties codeUserId, UserName, CityName, StateName, CountryName, ListltOrdergtcode and my DAL retrieves only that fields from Database.p  pstrongCase 2strongp  pI want to return now a user with the amount of orders, I end with the following fields in my business object codeUserId, UserName, CityName, StateName, CountryName, OrdersCountcode and the class could be called for example codeUserWithOrderCountcodep  pI have thought in some optionsp  ol liMake that two business classes and fill them separately in each DAL method this objects are simple but consider that method can have a complex select query that needs to be encapsulated for reuse so repository pattern doesnt fit well here, at least I think that.li liCreate only one object codeUsercode with all the properties codeUserId, UserName, CityName, StateName, CountryName, OrdersCount, ListltOrdergtcode and fill  only a subset in each DAL method, but that implies Semantic Coupling when you use a method, because you must know which subset of fields are filled from database, and semantic coupling is the worst of all coupling.li liOption 1 doesnt handle well if I need later in another view, both, codeListltOrdergtcode and codeOrdersCountcode properties.li liConsider now that if you use ASP.NET MVC good practices tells that you need a ViewModel to pass to the view, I thought to return ViewModels from my Businnes Layer, but I dont think is a good idea, it feels like I am violating something, and also is not possible because my business layer is in another assembly and not the web application.li liI dont want to write the same Linq query over and over again, but if use NHibernate or EFCodeFirst is like option one, and I will need to create tons of small business objects.li ol  pI wish to know if some of you have had this problem before and how do you handle this situation, I think this is a high level design decision, so I would appreciate your help.p

Negative 3421 pI am having an issue formulating an idea on how to work this problem. Please help. p  pMy project consists of an N x N grid with a series of blocks that are supposed to move in a random direction and random velocity within this grid every .1 seconds, the location of the block is updated with the velocity. I have three special blocks that are expected to have individual movement functions. I will have other blocks many of them doing nothing but updating their location, and making sure they remain in the grid.p  pNow these three blocks have functions beyond movement, but each of these runs individually, waiting for the other blocks special function to finish block 2 will wait on block 1, Block 3 will wait on 2 and set it back to block 1, etc. This queue of sorts will be running while the motion is happening. I want the motion to never stop. After each blocks nonmovement function runs n times, the code finishes.p  pMy question is this should I use threads to start and stop the nonmovement functions, or is there a way to just set a time and set booleans that could use a class function after .1 seconds to continuously move the objects and obviously loop over and over, and then use counts to end the program all together If so, how would you write main function for this in Python For all of this happening, does anyone think that Java would be significantly faster than Python in running this, especially if writing the data to a .txt filep

Negative 3421 pI have a UIViewController subclass which is having its view created programmatically within the loadView method.  The primary purpose of the view is to display information that is fetched from a store via core data.  How the view is created will be different depending on how many entities are received from the fetch, so I need this information ahead of time.  I believe all of the tutorials and sample code that I have seen so far shows fetch requests being executed in viewDidLoad or later, so I just wanted to ask if there are any reasons to avoid doing this in loadView.

Negative 3421 pMy development team is experiencing numerous codeORA12571 TNSpacket writer failurecode errors using ASP.NET 3.5 and 4.0 against Oracle 11g. These errors are inconsistent as to when they occur, and are generated by numerous applications. This exception happens while calling random stored procedures, packets, and inline SQL statements.  The Oracle 11 client is installed on the web server.  Some applications use Microsoft System.Data.OracleClient to connect to Oracle, and some use the .NET components provided by oracle ODP.NET.

Negative 3421 pI have Visual Studio 2010 and a pretty large web application project running on IIS 7. Startup for the web application is over a minute 75 seconds. Ive attached ANTS to it and very little of the 75 seconds is my code. Most of it seems to be something like CreateAppDomainWithHostingEnvironment and BuildManager stuff. Now I know that ASP .NET will compile dynamically the first time but I certainly dont expect it to compile for that long. Why could I be experiencing this problem and what are some ways I can try to fix it or try to better understand what is taking so much time. Aksi the CPU utilization doesnt seem to be that high. I have an awesome machine.p  pThe problem with the 75 second startup is that for developers working on this, everytime they make a change they have to wait this 75 seconds.p  pI am using .NET 4.0p  pstrongEDITstrong I ran Microsoft Network Monitor on my machine to see if there was anything suspicious going on the network. There wasnt as far as I can tell though i wasnt sure what to look for I am familiar with network monitor though so I did have an idea of what I was doing. I tried to run it in release build and though it may have improved the performance a little bit its not really significantp  pstrongEDITstrong I have SQL Session state. As far as i can tell, the connection string is pointing local. For some reasons though, when examinning ANTS, im getting a lot PollLockedSessionCallback on many threads. The function seems to be called over 70 times. Does this help at allp

Negative 3421 pI dont think this question has been posed before, at least not in the way I need it answered. Im using jQuerys .load function. I have a problem when loading just page fragments.p  pWhen using something likep  precodecontent.loadloadTest.html codepre  pAll of the scripts on loadTest.html load just fine. However, when loading page fragments like thisp  precodecontent.loadloadTest.html content codepre  pthe scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updatedp  pThis is clearly documented in a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comloadhttpapi.jquery.comloada which saysp  pstrongNotestrong emWhen calling .load using a URL without a suffixed selector expression, the content is passed to .html prior to scripts being removed. This executes the script blocks before they are discarded. If .load is however called with a selector expression appended to the URL, the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updated, which is why they are never executed. An example of both cases can be seen belowem p  pI understand that I could just externally load the script which can be used anywhere, but the thing is, Im using a pagewide ajax system where everything is loaded dynamically. So I dont really feel like having every single javascript function that Ill ever write 100s at this point in external files. Especially because some of these javascript functions are made from values loaded from a database which I cant account for in a .js file.p  pIs there any workaround for the scripts being stripped out prior to the DOM being updated Could I in some way manually load them in Any tiny example would be helpful to me.p

Negative 3421 pThis is, basically, a CultureInfo problem. Formally, in my country, the decimal separator is a comma , and a thousands separator is a dot .. In practice, however, this is only used by accountants and diligent people. Normally people never use a thousands separator, and they use both a comma and a dot interchangeably as a decimal separator. Ive seen this being the problem even in some Excel spreadsheets that I received from other people, with Excel not having recognized a dot as a decimal separator, leaving the field formatted as a string, rather than a number.p  pMy solution thus far has been to simply replace all commas in user input with dots and then parsing the double with InvariantCulture, like sop  precodestring userInput ... userInput  userInput.Replace,, . double result double.TryParseuserInput, NumberStyles.Float, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, out result codepre  pThis will obviously fail when someone actually enters the thousands separator and this seems to me more like a hack than a real solution. So, other than making my own parser for doubles, are there any cleaner ways to handle this problemp

Negative 3421 pI have a set of classes which extend an abstract class. The abstract class contains methods that make use of late static bindings to get information which is defined in the child classes. So for example, the abstract class might have a method containing the linep  precodevar  staticchildVar .  some text codepre  pIn this way, it is possible at runtime for the method defined in the abstract class to generate different strings based on the value of a variable defined in the child classes. p  pWhat I want to do is to have some mechanism that forces the child classes to declare this variable, eliminating the possibility of the method being called if the variable is not set.p  pUsing interfaces, it is possible to require a class to define methods and constants, which unfortunately cannot have their visibility modified using publicprotectedprivate. So if a class implements an interface, but does not define all the methods specified in the interface, an error is generated. However, there is no way to use an interface to require a class to define a property.p  pI have seen some material which suggests using getter methods in the interface e.g. getChildVar to implicitly require variable declaration, but this is not suitable for me as I dont want the variables to be accessible outside the class they have codeprotectedcode visibility.p  pSimilarly, constants will not work, because they do not support the codeprotectedcode visibility modifier.p  pI know I could always use an codeissetcode statement to check for this in the method or even in the constructor of the abstract class, but this seems inelegant compared to the use of interfaces for ensuring methods are defined. I am wondering if there is some standard way of doing this without hardcoding the requirements in my abstract class.p  pIncidentally, if anyone knows why you cant declare variables inside interfaces, Id be interested to know what the reasoning is. It seems like a major oversight to me. p  pAny help will be much appreciated.p

Negative 3421 pemprologueembr emHowever one important discovery i make during testing the md5, adler32 and crc32 on a 100Mb file, is that strangely it take the same time. This can only mean one of two thing i guess, that on The Android device, the filesystem is the bottleneck and it cannot feed the algorithm fast enough, or i made a fundamental error implementing JNI, the later one i could live with.em p  pHashing small files like images, mp3 and files under 10Mb take seconds using the MD5  algorithm.   p  pMy problem is i have files with sizes over 100700MB.p  pMy requirement is that downloaded files need to match the original source file.   p  pI did some tests for making MD5 hashes for a file with the size of 100Mb.   p  pOn the device HTC Desire Android v2.2 i run both a jni native test and the java codeMessageDigest.getInstanceMD5code test.p  pBoth tests calculated the MD5 of the same file and both test run approximation for the same length of time 12min. I had debugging turned of.   p  pIt was my understanding that the Native test would be faster.p  pHow can i get the hashing time down to let say 1015sec for 100MB on the above device.br The cost for this is of course collision accuracy but i can live with that the hash is not same in one in a million. p  pemUPDATEem Im no c guru but here is my test ccode for MD5.

Negative 3421 pSince I got some negative comments on my system design on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9946135accessingaprotectedmemberofasuperclasstypedmemberobjectanelegantsothisa question concerning the implementation of such system, I hope that if I present the problem I could get some better suggestions.p  pI am trying to design a modular application to be used for feature matching in video frames e.g. matching on very close frames of a movie or a video, like the product in a hrefhttpweb.cs.swarthmore.eduturnbullcs97f08papersivic03.pdf relnofollowthis articlea by Sivic, Zisserman.p  pThe idea is to allow for an easy switch between different emfeature detectionem algorithms as well as different emmatching proceduresem. Additionally, from my research, my understanding is that there is only a few basic matching procedures, while new matching methods mainly focus on additional pruning procedures for bad matches e.g. spatial consistency in the a hrefhttpweb.cs.swarthmore.eduturnbullcs97f08papersivic03.pdf relnofollowsame articlea. All the pruning procedures require for the initial matching to be done, and then do some additional work on the emextracted featuresem from the base and query images emcoupled by the matchingem, rejecting the bad matches.p  hr  pThe idea I had for the design is as followsp  ul liimplement a base interface codefeatureDetectorcodeli liall concrete feature detection algorithms inherit from codefeatureDetectorcode interface e.g. codesiftDetectorcodeli liimplement a base interface codefeatureMatchercodeli liall concrete matching methods inherit from the codefeatureMatchercode interface e.g. codeclass bruteForceMatchercode or wrappers for OpenCV matchers like codecvMatchercodeli liimplement a base interface codeimageMatchercode implementing a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStrategypattern relnofollowstrongStrategystronga pattern to allow for a choice of codefeatureDetectorcode and codefeatureMatchercodeli lifor all the matching pruning procedures, implement a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDecoratorpattern relnofollowstrongDecoratorstronga interface that inherits the base matching interface codeclass matcherDecorator  public imageMatchercodeli lieach additional pruning  filtering procedure implements the codematcherDecoratorcode interface e.g. codespatialConsistencyFiltercode and contains only the constructor with codeimageMatchercode as the only argument representing the component to be decoratedli ul  pThe problems pointed out to me in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9946135accessingaprotectedmemberofasuperclasstypedmemberobjectanelegantsothis questiona arise from the specific results of the feature detection and matching process, and they concern the emDecoratorem part of the design. Each codeimageMatchercode should hold emextracted featuresem from both of the images base and query, as well as the emmatches betweenem the extracted features. The internal representation of features is slightly different from the feature descriptors offered to the user via the public access function of codeimageMatchercodep  precodeclass imageMatcher     private  or protected         ...         ...         stdvector ltinternalFeatureDescriptorgt feats[2]              no more than 500  1000 features can be expected          stdvector ltstdpair ltint, intgt gt matches              size is the same order of magnitude as the number of features         ...     public         stdvector ltuserFriendlyFeaturesgt getFeaturesint baseOrQuery         const stdvector ltstdpairltint, intgt gt ampgetMatches         ...  codepre  pNow, since the feature vectors as well as the matches vector are quite heavy, I emwould not like to copyem them in to each one of the nested decorators filters when I use them. I do not have any problems with the codematchescode vector, since it offers a public interface for the user allowing the decorator access to the reference and omitting the need to copy the data. codefeatscode vectors, on the other hand, do not offer such an interface, and their access function requires me to do not only copying, but also recalculation of features internal representation. This in turn results in the need for the decorator to access emthe private or protected variables of the inner superclass pointerem.p  pI managed to grant my self access to the needed vectors without violating any privacy constraints I think Im not doing anything evil implementationaly, but it has been suggested that the very idea of accessing the private members of the superclass violates the idea of the emDecoratorem pattern.p  hr  pAll that said, I am interested in any suggestions about how to refactor my code, comments on my current implementation and anything else concerning the design of my application.p

In code this means Id really like to avoid code like this in the import codep  precode[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow0.25]] codepre  pThe app is iOS 5 only so the slowest device it needs to support is an iPhone 3GS.p  pHere are the resources Ive used so far to develop my current solutionp  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataArticlescdImporting.htmlApples Core Data Programming Guide Efficiently Importing Dataap  ul liUse Autorelease Pools to keep the memory down li liRelationships Cost.

I do this so my saves can be asynchronous and therefore very fast. I create it on launch like thisp  precodemasterManagedObjectContext  [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyTypeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType] [masterManagedObjectContext setPersistentStoreCoordinatorcoordinator] codepre  pstrongmainManagedObjectContextstrong  This is the context the UI uses everywhere. It is a child of the masterManagedObjectContext. I create it like thisp  precodemainManagedObjectContext  [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyTypeNSMainQueueConcurrencyType] [mainManagedObjectContext setUndoManagernil] [mainManagedObjectContext setParentContextmasterManagedObjectContext] codepre  pstrongbackgroundContextstrong  This context is created in my NSOperation subclass that is responsible for importing the XML data into Core Data.

Just by doing this 3 context setup I was able to improve my import speed by over 10x Honestly, this is hard to believe. This basic design should be part of the standard Core Data template...p  pDuring the import process I save 2 different ways. Every 1000 items I save on the background contextp  precodeBOOL saveSuccess  [backgroundContext saveamperror] codepre  pThen at the end of the import process, I save on the masterparent context which, ostensibly, pushes modifications out to the other child contexts including the main contextp  precode[masterManagedObjectContext performBlock    NSError parentContextError  nil    BOOL parentContextSaveSuccess  [masterManagedObjectContext saveampparentContextError] ] codepre  pstrongProblemstrong The problem is that my UI will not update until I reload the view.p  pI have a simple UIViewController with a UITableView that is being fed data using a NSFetchedResultsController.

The best solution for this is TransactionScope. Npgsql declare support of enlistment in system transaction.p  pThen goes my trouble I use code from documentation, this code do next thingsp  ol liCreate transaction scopeli liOpen first connectionli liOpen second connectionli liDo insert into first connectionli liDo insert into second connectionli liClose second connectinli liClose first connectionli liCall scope.Completeli liDispose scopeli ol  pI wait, that after 9 step data will be fully commited to db. In fact at steps 6 and 7 npgsql creates prepared transaction and at step 9 do nothing. Finaly i have two prepated transaction, that block database. And there is nobody for commit or rollback them.p  pGeneraly if i close connection before call complete on scope for example becouse of the exception npgsql creates prepared transaction that block table. I think its not rigth behavior. I wait that after scope dispose data will be fully commited or fully rollbacked. With out any prepared transaction.p  pYou can repeat this bug with code from documentation. For reference Devart free library work correct.p

Negative 3421 pI have a database which I sometime like to manually explore, in order to get info.p  pI currently use squirrel sql client, which is quite good, but theres a feature I miss badly  when I issue a simple select to a table, lets say theres a line I want to know references.p  pFor that purpose, I need to manually write big sql request with inner joins, which can be quite daunting...p  pSo my question  is there any possibly free SQL Client that just lets you explore the possible inner joins p  pFor example, a click on the line id would give me all the lines from other tables referencing it, just as simply as an hypertext link would do...p

Negative 3421 pAlright, Im copying some code C that needs to run on my server Python, everything was going well until the bit below.p  pIn a nutshell here is what I have in the C programp  precode int main   ...  ...  int64 value  0  bool blah  function1ampvalue  ...     bool function1int64 value    ...  uchar pb[8]  pb  x00x00x00x00Q x00   memcpyvalue,pb,8  now value has the value 0x7fff33516970   codepre  pSo yeah, it creates some char array and then copies the value into an int64. p  pNow my strongquestionstrong is how do I do that in Python I mean, I have the bytestring that is equivalent to pb but I have no idea where to go from there especially since there are all those zeroes...p
Negative 3421 pIm writing a multithreaded program in C using C11 threading library.p  pI have the following requirementsp  ol liMain thread listens to some type of events, and fires off a new thread for each new eventli liWhen program termination is requested, new thread creation is blocked and we wait for the old threads to finishli ol  pI have the option to store the threads in some container, for example, a list. Before exit, all threads in the container are codejoincodeed. However, since STL containers are not threadsafe, additional synchronization is needed when adding a new thread and removing a finished thread from the container. The interaction between the main thread and the child threads becomes a little more complicated in this case. Should the child thread remove itself from the container If not, how does it let the main thread know when its time to remove etc.p  pAnother way I see is to have an atomic int which is incremented by the main thread when a child thread is created, and decremented by the child thread right before its termination threads will be codedetachcodeed after creation, so I wont have to manage any stdthread objects. Before exiting, we just wait for the atomic integer to become 0 in a simple loop. This solution looks better to me because there are less moving parts and no locking at least as long as the target platform has a lockfree implementation of codestdatomicltintgtcode. p  pSo, my question is, which of the above methods would you preferp

Negative 3421 pIve got an NginxGunicornDjango server deployed on a Centos 6 machine with only the SSL port 443 visible to the outside world.

Port 443 is the only way to hit the server.p  pIm using Nginx to serve my static files CSS, etc. and all other requests are handled by Gunicorn, which is running Django at codehttplocalhost8000code. So, navigating to codehttpsdomain.comcode works just fine, as do links within the admin site, but when I submit a form in the Django admin, the https is lost on the redirect and Im sent to codehttpdomain.comcoderequesturi which fails to reach the server. The POST action does work properly even so and the database is updated.p  pMy configuration file is listed below.

Negative 3421 pI am trying to determine the best approach on Android for supporting multiple languages.  I understand how resource folders work, and how they get selected when the activity loads andor has a configuration change.  I also have seen a technique of creating a new locale, assigning it as the default, and broadcasting a config change.  This works.  But I get the impression from this thread httpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicandroiddevelopersZGOTHwzlw and the answers from the google framework team this way of doing things is not recommended  supported.  So my questions arep  ol lipWhat is the recommended way to support multi languages on the fly without sending the user to the OS menus for language selectionpli lipSame question for keyboard input.pli lipFinally, I see on my Motorola Xoom when I ask the Locale class for supported languages an impressive list.  For instance, jaJP, which Ive tested and seen allows me to display Japanese chars.  However there is no SIP for this language on the device.  Can I download new keyboards to my platform in these cases  It just seems odd to me that the platform would support displaying many more languages than it could input.pli ol
Negative 3421 pI need to display data using the PyQt class codeQTableWidgetcode. But there could be dozens of thousand lines. Displaying the whole sheet makes the appli to hang...p  pSo I found a solution consisting on loading data meaning that the sheet is created but hidding most of the rows and, when moving the scroll bar, show new rows and hidding previous ones. p  pIn the bellow code, I setted codeself.rowsShown  50code and at the init the lines from 1 to 50 are shown. And I previously did codeself.verticalScrollBar.actionTriggered.connectself.refreshDisplaycode.p  pSo the code isp  precodedef refreshDisplayself          This is to refresh the display when the scrollbar is moved            Minimum is reached and a previous row exists     if self.verticalScrollBar.value lt self.verticalScrollBar.minimum and self.isRowHiddenself.firstRowShown1 Minimum is reached and a previous row exists         for row in xrangeself.lastRowShown1, self.lastRowShown             self.hideRowrow             self.lastRowShown  1         for row in xrangeself.firstRowShown1, self.firstRowShown             self.showRowrow             self.firstRowShown  1      Maximum is reached and a next row exists     if self.verticalScrollBar.value gt self.verticalScrollBar.maximum and self.isRowHiddenself.lastRowShown1         for row in xrangeself.firstRowShown, self.firstRowShown1             self.hideRowrow             self.firstRowShown  1         for row in xrangeself.lastRowShown, self.lastRowShown1             self.showRowrow             self.lastRowShown  1 codepre  pThis is working very well when I use the roll of the mouse or click on buttons of the scrollbar. But when I grab the slider or use the keypad to move the case selected, Im blocked in the area shown. p  pMoreover, the size of the scrolling area correspond to the rows shown only. I would like to redifine it to set my own bar for example with a size based on the real number of lines, so that I can move fastly to another part of the sheet. But the size of the scroll bar is always updated with the number of lines shown.p  pSo, what I expect from you is to help me to resolve this two issues, OR give me another idea for displaying such huge sheet. Maybe I missed a module or class that already bear this functionnality of loadingshowing lines whilemoving the cursor.p  pThanksp

Negative 3421 pIve been reading a lot these days, and Im not sure about the specific use of it. I need ask it, because cannot find someone who explain it to me. Now Im lost..p  pThe main problem is I need install my app python  glade in usrsharenameapp and a .desktop file in usrshareapplications in Ubuntu.p  pThe solution that Ive find is creating a .deb file because the installation is perfect. In ubuntu I can launch it with Unity clicking on the launcher, the .desktop. Probably Ill upload it to Ubuntu Software Center.p  pFor windows I could use py2exe or a similar, and another one for Mac.p  pBut, like the code is in GitHub, it should have a setup or a makefile to install it.p  pAfter reading and reading and reading, I think that setup.py is only for install a module and then import it with python. However if I have to install and app, how can I distribute it making a setup.py or a makefile Which is better for install an app Which is the diference What I have to usep  pThanksp

Negative 3421 pI have encountered a difficulty while trying to figure out how certain aspect of my program will work There is no code written at the moment, only concept.p  pI have a PC application which I want to build with C. In addition I have few android devices with my java application on it, which will be dependent on the PC application but will have its own functionality.p  pThe android application will have to read data from the PC application and vice versa as well.p  pAt first I thought creating a server which all applications will read from. But now Im thinking maybe there is a easier, less complex way since I have no idea about accessing to servers and Ill have to learn the entire thing  creating a network and shared folders  now the PC application will save his data at the shared folders and the android application will read the data from the shared folder, every 5 minutes or something like that or create a listener that will update the application upon any change made by the PC application. The android application will have to do the same, save his data at the shared folders and let the PC read from the shared folder.p  pBasically, this is my idea, now my question arep  ol lipWhat do you think about the implementation of the ideapli lipIs it possible to access shared network folder with android devicepli lipIs it possible to add android device to home networkpli lipThe combination of C PC application and java will be alrightpli ol  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 3421 pIm new to Eclipse, having done a lot of development in Visual Studio and XCode.p  pWhen I create a C project in my source tree the project explorer shows all the files in that folder and subfolders. However there are lots of unrelated files that I dont want to see.p  pIn Visual Studio and XCode I have to manually link source code to the project. This allows me to control the clutter of the project. Nonproject files are hidden by default, because they arent added to the project. In Eclipse everything is added by default. It seems that you cant decouple the file systems storage from the view you see in the project explorer.p  pAlso I have a bunch of source in my tree that I dont want to compile as part of this project. Because its for a different platform. I cant see how to remove these files from the compile list without also removing them from the file system.p  pReading the docs hasnt helped much.

In detail the method codeAuthenticatorBase.invokecode from org.apache.catalina.authenticator calls the method codeRealmBase.hasResourcePermissioncode and there the roles will be checked. p  pSince I dont use any predefined roles the check will fail. p  pMy question Is there any way to use code like that p  precodePathsecure Stateless public class SecuredRestEndpoint         Resource     SessionContext ctx      GET     public Response performLogging            Receive user information         Principal callerPrincipal  ctx.getCallerPrincipal         String userId  callerPrincipal.getName          if ctx.isCallerInRoleADMIN               return 200 if ok             return Response.statusStatus.OK.entityuserId.build              ...       codepre  pSome additional background There is the requirement to use a reverse proxy for authentication just the username gets forwarded XFORWARDUSER.

Negative 3421 pWhen I seek to some position in a file and write a small amount of data 20 bytes, what goes on behind the scenesp  pstrongMy understandingstrongp  pTo my knowledge, the smallest unit of data that can be written or read from a disk is one sector traditionally 512 bytes, but that standard is now changing.  That means to write 20 bytes I need to read a whole sector, modify some of it in memory and write it back to disk.p  pThis is what I expect to be happening in unbuffered IO.  I also expect buffered IO to do roughly the same thing, but be clever about its cache.  So I would have thought that if I blow locality out the window by doing random seeks and writes, both buffered and unbuffered IO ought to have similar performance...  maybe with unbuffered coming out slightly better.p  pThen again, I know its crazy for buffered IO to only buffer one sector, so I might also expect it to perform terribly.p  pstrongMy applicationstrongp  pI am storing values gathered by a SCADA device driver that receives remote telemetry for upwards of a hundred thousand points.  There is extra data in the file such that each record is 40 bytes, but only 20 bytes of that needs to be written during an update.p  pstrongPreimplementation benchmarkstrongp  pTo check that I dont need to dream up some brilliantly overengineered solution, I have run a test using a few million random records written to a file that could contain a total of 200,000 records.  Each test seeds the random number generator with the same value to be fair.  First I erase the file and pad it to the total length about 7.6 meg, then loop a few million times, passing a random file offset and some data to one of two test functionsp  precodevoid WriteOldSchool void context, long offset, Data data       int fd  intcontext     lseek fd, offset, SEEKSET      write fd, voiddata, sizeofData    void WriteStandard void context, long offset, Data data       FILE fp  FILEcontext     fseek fp, offset, SEEKSET      fwrite voiddata, sizeofData, 1, fp      fflushfp  codepre  pstrongMaybe no surprisesstrongp  pThe codeOldSchoolcode method came out on top  by a lot.  It was over 6 times faster 1.48 million versus 232000 records per second.  To make sure I hadnt run into hardware caching, I expanded my database size to 20 million records file size of 763 meg and got the same results.p  pBefore you point out the obvious call to codefflushcode, let me say that removing it had no effect.  I imagine this is because the cache must be committed when I seek sufficiently far away, which is what Im doing most of the time.p  pstrongSo, whats going onstrongp  pIt seems to me that the buffered IO must be reading and possibly writing all of a large chunk of the file whenever I try to write.  Because I am hardly ever taking advantage of its cache, this is extremely wasteful.p  pIn addition and I dont know the details of hardware caching on disk, if the buffered IO is trying to write a bunch of sectors when I change only one, that would reduce the effectiveness of the hardware cache.p  pAre there any disk experts out there who can comment and explain this better than my experimental findings p

Negative 3421 pCurrently I have one Windows Azure Cloud Service Project Service1 that will put messages into a storage queue to be pulled by another cloud service, and then later pull messages out of a different storage queue. Based on the messages received by this service, an object may be added to a SQL Azure Database. So Far I have adding to the Queue working, and I have created a service library that contains the Entity DataModel for the SQL Database which so far only has one table, tblCustomers.

When your mouse leaves the div area for rolloverad , the bigger div goes back to codedisplaynonecode. I would like it so when you hover over the rolloverad div, and the rolloveradexpanded div appears, the rolloverexpanded div stays visible until your mouse leaves the rolloverexpanded div area, and not the smaller rollover ad div.  It makes a lot more sense once you view the jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJuruE relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netJuruEap  pLooking at the jsfiddle.. when you hover over the grey box that says hover a big black box appears.

Negative 3421 pI am currently in the design phase where we have several servers that make up our system and I need to work out what is the best way to store session information so that each of the servers can get access to it. Session information is basically a guid for the session id and a list of user group names.p  pThe main client applications are web and mobile apps.p  pI have the following configurationp  pA master server where all users log in and the session object is filled with the user group information that corresponds to the user. There could be up to 10,000 users at peak log in.p  pSlave servers which contain archiving content and most users would then via the UI be talking directly to the slave servers. The slave servers need the session information which is initially determined on the master server.p  pOne option was to move the session data for each log in to the slave servers and cache it on the slave, then each slave could work independently and it will not need to reference the master server.p  pThe other option is to have central database which contains the session information but since our databases are on each server we dont have a separate machine to act as a database server, each slave will have a remote connection string back to the master server database. No doubt this will slow things down if I have to query the database remotely from the slave server.p  pI then have the situation where I need to clean up sessions but in general I dont expect more that 25 MB of data at the peak log in.p  pWe could have up to 10 slave servers.p  pWhat is the best solutionp

Negative 3421 pstrongMy Taskstrongp  pIn my JavaScript code im often using objects to map keys to values so i can later access them directly through a certain value. For examplep  precodevar helloMap   helloMap.de  Hallo helloMap[en]  Hello helloMap.es  Hola codepre  pSo i build up the map object step by step in my source code using the two available notations emobject styleem and emarray styleem.p  pLater i can then access the values i added through codehelloMap[de]code for example. So thats all fine if i dont have to care about the order in which the attributes has been set on the object.p  pIf i want to iterate the objects properties now as far as i know there is no way to ensure that ill iterate them in the order they have been added.p  pstrongNotestrong I cant use some wrapper object and simply hold a array in there and then use its methods to add the values so something like thisp  precodevar HelloMap  function   this.myMap  []   this.addProperty  functionkey, value     this.myMap.pushkey key, value value     codepre  por something similar wont work for me. So the solution needs to be absolutely transparent to the programmer using the object.p  pThat said the object i needed would be an empty object which maintains the order of the properties that were added to it. Something like this would dop  precodevar helloMap   helloMap  getOrderAwareObjecthelloMap codepre  pso that every further assignment of the form codehelloMap.xy  foocode and codehelloMap[yz]  barcode would be tracked in the object in order,p  pstrongPossible Solutionsstrongp  pSince i did not find any solution in underscore or jQuery giving me such a special object i came across the possibility of defining getters and setters for properties in JavaScript objects with codeObject.definePropertycode since i can rely on emECMAScript 5em standard i can use it.p  pThe Problem with this one is, that you have to know all the possible properties that can be set on the object, before they are actually set. Since if you emdefineem it you got to emnameem it.p  pWhat i am searching for is something like a strongDefault Getterstrong and strongDefault Setterstrong which applies on the object if no getter and setter has been defined for the property. So i could then hide the strongsorted mapstrong behind the object inteface.p  ul liIs there already a solution for this in any framework you knowli liIs there a mechanism like default gettersetter li ul

Negative 3421 pI am trying to add a computed column to a table via SSMS  Id rather care not to get into the details on why the base column is a codeVARCHAR10code and not a codeDATEcode and no, Im not interested in changing it.p  pWhen I enter the formula codeCONVERTDATE, [charDob]code in the table designer SSMS reports p  blockquote   pError validating the the formula for column codecharDobTypedcode.p blockquote  pUsing the formula code[charDob]code works as expected, meaning the column is bound correctly. Also the formula codeCONVERTDATE, 2001code works as expected  so there is something with using the column that is causing the error.p  pThe original column is a codeVARCHAR10code and contains NULL values emorem values that are otherwise convertible to codeDATEcode. The query codeSELECT CONVERTDATE,charDob as dob FROM peoplecode works as expected. Also, the error message is about invalid formula and not about a data conversion error, so I dont believe that inconvertible is causing this.p  pI have already saved the table with the new computed column and a dummy value and reconnected to the database  this was to ensure that there was not an odd caching issue occurring, as sometimes occurs. The error persists independent of the persisted flag  if only it were that easy to turn off.p

Negative 3421 pSo heres the deal I have an asp.net control that is located on some content pages but not others.

Unfortunately, when loading a page that doesnt use the control but uses the master page, I get an object reference error on that VB code lt emblah blahem . p  pI tried using a javascript if statement to detect if the content page doesnt include the control simply by using the title to check if we are dealing with a content page I know wont include this controlp  precodeif ttl.indexof Sign Up  1      var depddb  document.getElementByIdlt body.findcontroldepddb.ClientId gt     var filterButton  document.getElementByIdltbody.findcontrolfilterButton.ClientId gt  codepre  p. . . but it still caused the object reference error. I believe ASP is trying to compile the code included in the lt  tags first, and is returning an error since it doesnt exist. Which would mean there is no javascriptbased if statement I can use to omit this code when necessary. p  hr  pSo my question is thisp  pstrongWhat method can be used to safely reference an asp.net control from the master page when the control exists in the content page, and omit the reference when it does not existstrongp  hr

It is a encrypter, which means that it gets a piece of text and encrypts it using some famous cyphers like the numerical cypher, the caesars cypher, and others.br Now, I wanted to give the user the option to save the text he encrypted, and also the encrypted text generated by the program. For that, I created two checkbutton on the programs menu one for save text and the other for save encrypted text. My question is, I tried to attach a function as its command option, so, I guess it should run that function when the option is clicked. But it isnt happening.br Ill just explain what the funcitions shouls do before passing the code.br They should prompt a question, asking the user if heshe really wants to create a text file with the text and the encrypted text This isnt a database, its just something for the user to be able to read later the texts heshe encrypted and the encrypted version, if heshe wants to.

Negative 3421 pI have received PHPJS code from  previous developer and I need to add number validation to a Mobile Number field. I already have the HTML validation in place but I need to add that if someone presses an invalid key, that it doesnt get displayed only to highlight the field later in red because it contains invalid input.p  pIve seen many regexs used and tried them but they had an eitheror effect from what I need which is If a letter or special character is entered, do not accept and do not display, all other input digits, keys is accepted I need the invalid character not be displayed at all, not displayed and then erased. The regex that is working the most now is thisp  precodefunction filterNonDigitsevt    var event  evt  window.event   var keyentered  event.keyCode  event.which   keyentered  String.fromCharCodekeyentered    var regex1  [09].   var regex2  [azAZ.,amp[]ltgts]    if regex2.testkeyentered       event.returnValue  false     ifevent.preventDefault event.preventDefault    codepre  pWhen I used the commented regex1 with the IF condition reversed, naturally it limited input to only digits thus preventing all keys such as Delete, BackSpace, etc. When using regex2, I still cant press Delete or the digits from the numpad.p  pSo my question is, can the above code be modified to accept only digits but also allow keys Another important point is that I need a method that doesnt use keycodes 8, 24 etc for those key, in order to make sure all keyboard types can be used.p  hr  h2New Updateh2  pSo my solution is as follows If the oninput property exists, I use the solution provided by Ehtesham and if it doesnt, the backup uses the solution provided by Rohan Kumar.

Negative 3421 pI have a custom View that will manage hundreds of discrete userdefined sequential drawing events. Rather than maintaining a collection of all of the individual text, line, shape updates and then redrawing them all during each onDraw, I grab a Bitmap of the canvas at the end of each onDraw and then start the next onDraw with that Bitmap.  A description of my problem follows this snippetp  precodepublic class TestView extends View implements OnTouchListener      private Paint mPaint     private Bitmap mPrevCanvas     private int mTouchCount  0      float mX  50f     float mY  50f      public TestViewContext context          supercontext         setFocusabletrue         setFocusableInTouchModetrue               this.setOnTouchListenerthis         this.setDrawingCacheEnabledtrue          mPaint  new Paint         mPaint.setTextSize30f           Override     protected void onDrawCanvas canvas              if mTouchCount  0              canvas.drawTextTouch screen to begin, 50f, 100f, mPaint          else              if mPrevCanvas  null                  canvas.drawBitmapmPrevCanvas, 0, 0, mPaint                           canvas.drawTextInteger.toStringmTouchCount, mX, mY, mPaint             mPrevCanvas  getDrawingCache.copyBitmap.Config.ARGB8888, false                    public boolean onTouchView arg0, MotionEvent event          if event.getAction  MotionEvent.ACTIONUP              mX  event.getX             mY  event.getY             mTouchCount  1             invalidate                  return true       codepre  pIt seems to be working okay for the first touch event, but then mPrevCanvas never gets updated again.  In reviewing the previous questions related to getDrawingCache, only  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11055133getDrawingCache is not updateda seemed relevant, but based on that users selfdiscovered answer, that apparently wasnt the same problem.p  pWhen running this custom view, touching the screen displays a 1 at the position you touch.  It then captures a Bitmap of the canvas with that 1 in it.  Subsequent touches redisplay that Bitmap stored in mPrevCanvas showing the 1 again at the same position, and then the new number representing the current touch event e.g., 2, 3, etc.  Since Im refreshing mPrevCanvas at the end of each onDraw, I expect each onDraw to begin by displaying a Bitmap containing the results of all of the previous touch events... but for some reason the mPrevCanvas Bitmap is never updated to include that anything except that initial event 1.p  pIve a verified that isDrawingCacheEnabled is still true during each pass through onDraw b tried throwing in destroyDrawingCache and buildDrawingCache to no avail c forced mPrevCanvas to null before the call to getDrawingCache to make sure its really getting updated and d searched through my copy of OReillys Java in a Nutshell on the hunch that maybe I have a java headspace problem rather than an Android API problem.p  pQ1 Why will getDrawingCache only return a Bitmap containing that emfirstem call to canvas.drawText, but never with the results of any of the subsequent drawText callsp  pQ2 Given that Im doing it this way for resource efficiency, should I be using some other design pattern anywayp

Negative 3421 pIs there a way to pass a numpy array into CSWIG by just using a pointer to the first element  I have a C function that anticipates a 3byN matrix, which is expected to be stored in columnmajor indexed contiguous memory.

The players view rotates horizontally around the Y axis with mouse movement. a hrefhttpi.imgur.comsYR7hCu.jpg relnofollow[Here]a is a screenshot to get a better idea.p  pSo Im trying to animate the axe swinging back and forth when holding down the mouse. At the moment, Im storing the global position and rotation of the player within the Player class as variables mx, my, mz, mrotationX, mrotationY, mrotationZ.p  pWhen I draw the object, I transform all these coordinates into global space to create a world matrix. So yeah, these are global coordinates. mrotationY gets changed based on mouse movement.p  pWhat this means is that if I increment mrotationX i.e. by a sin value of some animation increment, the object gets rotated GLOBALLY, which means if I look left or right, the axe is swinging across the screen instead of away from it.p  pMy question What kind of matrix transformations will I have to do to convert some local x rotation value into global x, y, and z rotation values.p  precodeifmattacking      mattackAnimation  0.1f     float rotationAmount  sinmattackAnimation  0.1       How do I figure out mrotationX, mrotationY and mrotationZ       from rotationAmount here c  codepre  pMy thoughts so far have been to create an X Rotation Matrix, then transform some kind of vector using that, but all of my experimentation with that has been pretty unsuccessful.p  pThanks for your time Dp  pemstrongEDITemstrongp  pMore diagramsp  pThis is what happens when I do codemrotationX  rotationAmountcodep  pa hrefhttpimgur.comayZqzx relnofollowhttpimgur.comayZqzxap  pemstrongEDIT 2emstrongp  pSo based on Federicos answer, I have the following code set upp  precode Get the local right vector D3DXVECTOR3 right1, 0, 0 D3DXMATRIX rotationY D3DXMatrixRotationYamprotationY, mrotationY D3DXVec3TransformCoordampright, ampright, amprotationY   Calculate the theta value we want to rotate by mattackAnimation  0.1f float rotationAmount  sinmattackAnimation  0.1  Cross product D3DXVECTOR3 axis D3DXVECTOR3 up0, 1, 0 D3DXVec3Crossampaxis, ampright, ampup  Rotation matrix D3DXMATRIX matrix D3DXMatrixRotationAxisampmatrix, ampaxis, rotationAmount codepre  pThis SHOULD give me a rotation matrix representing a local rotation in the X axis.

Negative 3421 pI am working with a plot that I need to somehow apply a unique regression to.  The plot is a series of points placed on loglog axes.  For anyone familiar with hydrology, Im trying to graphically produce a transient Theis solution, so my regression needs to be in the form of an exponential integral see this a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAquifertestTransientTheissolution relnofollow titleWikipedia pageWikipedia pagea.p  pIts important to note here that the exponential integral has its own set of axes values that are independent of the initial plot.  This is how a solution is pulled from the data, but it introduces a number of problems when trying to reproduce it in R.p  pIve come up with a few ideas to deal with this beyond using a pencil and paper, but have hit some small snags with each of the approaches.  Id appreciate any insight into workarounds for any of these solutionsp  ol lipAdding a regression to the plot using codestatsmoothcode, arbitrarily selecting a point on the regression based on its slope, then correlating that to the same slope of a new plot that has the appropriate axes for the exponential integral.  The issue here is that I am not sure how to use codestatsmoothcode with a formula other than variations on codey  xcode, codey  polyx, 2code, and codey  logxcode.  The regression would call for a combination of the poly and log functions, but R hiccups when I try to do this.  For examplep  precodestatsmoothdata  example, method  lm,     formula  y  logx  x  polyx, 24  polyx, 318  ... codepreli lipIve also tried to plot the data and the exponential integral as two separate plots, then overlay the two plots based on where I arbitrarily believe the bestfit to be this may be the easier method, and is plenty accurate enough for my purposes.  To facilitate the overlay, Ive stripped the exponential integral plot of its background, axes, gridlines, etc. and left only a horizontal and vertical line with labels to indicate a point with certain values on the curve.  If I can place this on top of the other plot assuming, of course, that both plots maintain the same size ratio, I figure I can nudge the regression around until it lines up where I think it should, then read off its corresponding values based on the presence of the horizontal and vertical labeled lines.p  pIve read a little bit about codeannotationrastercode, and think it may be an appropriate way for me to treat the regression as an overlayed image.  My issue, though, is with converting a codeggplotcode plot to a raster first.  codeas.rastercode produces the following errorp  precodeError in as.rasterraster     error in evaluating the argument x in selecting a method for function as.raster Error in UseMethodas.raster     no applicable method for as.raster applied to an object of class cgg, ggplot codepre  pA similar error appears if I try to use the coderastercode package and convert the plot using the coderastercode function.

For each node a QDataWidgetMapper is associated with that row. The QDataWidgetMapper synchronizes the widget fields with the appropriate node values. All events, drag, and drop, selection, ... must be handled by the widgets. Widgets provide drop containers. The nested widgets represent the data hierarchy.pli lipstrongImplement a custom QAbstractItemView, and use delegatesstrongp  pI am aiming for something like a NassiShneiderman diagram. Therefore, the standard QTreeView cannot be applied. However, it should be possible to create a basic hierarchic layout inheriting QAbstractItemView. A custom delegate is used, to paint the XML data with the form widgets, and create the editors. The QAbstractItemView is responsible for drag, drop, managing the selection model, somehow listening to button events to remove items from the hierarchy, and to ask the delegate for an editor.pli lipstrongSomething elsestrongp  pI am far away from being a Qt guru.

Negative 3421 pI am using MVC3, Razor, C, EF4.1, MSSQL2008p  pI have implemented a mechanism to upload files to a web server Uploads folder.p  pThe issue I have is that when the user is returned to the Upload view, the image is still the old one. This may be linked to the fact that I am using the PK of the Users Organisation as the filename ie 100.png. So swapping the image will produce another 100.png, ie overwrite the original. This prevents lots of rubbish files if I used a GUID instead.

Negative 3421 pI have a web application that talks to a web service using protobuf. The service itself provides methods to get the .proto descriptors. p  pWhen I first tackled this the only protobuf library I found was protobufnet recently I have come across the protobufcsharpport, but I will get to that in a moment. Documentation for this library is quite limited and not having any prior knowledge of protobuf, the approach I initially took was to generate all my C classes and enums automatically via T4 applying the ProtoContract and ProtoMember attributes.p  pThis worked fine but made my web application very brittle to changes. The web app acts as an interface to multiple versions of the web service that are under development, so gracefully handling change is a requirement.p  pDigging a little further I found how to generate a TypeModel dynamically and bind that to my pregenerated classes. e.g.p  precodeRuntimeTypeModel model  TypeModel.Create  model.Addtypeof MyClass, false.Add1, Id.Add2, Name  TypeModel compiledModel  model.Compile codepre  pThis did successfully improve the robustness of the application to changes such as the addition or removal of optional fields everything on the web service is optional in terms of its contract, but because I am still bound to a concrete type MyClass in the example above that are pregenerated, I am still susceptible to request  response model name changes.p  pSo my question is there a way with protobufnet to generate a TypeModel that is not coupled to any concrete classes in my project p  pI understand that the CJavaPython library by google supports with dynamic messages this which is what the web service developers use, and why they have the expectation on me that renaming a class should not break my side, but currently it does.p  pIn searching for a solution with protobufnet I came across the protobufcsharpport project that is a closer port of googles and does appear to have the functionality I require although I dont really know how to achieve it at this point. So before undertake all the work to switch libraries I thought it would be prudent to check if what I require is possible in anyway with protobufnet.p  pIs there any other way to tell the TypeModel which model to use to serialise  deserialise without it being bound to a concrete type E.g. by name that I can get from the descriptors for the given version of the web server.p  pThanks in advance for any help or advice.p

Negative 3421 pWeve built a WCF Rest service with various functions allowing us to access data from our database but wed like to restrict access to these functions for obvious security reason but it doesnt have to be too complicated.p  pIn short, this is what I had in mindp  ol lipThe first steps to access our service is to call a logon function of some sort where a username and password are passed.pli lipWhen authenticated against our database or other, it would generate a token of some sort i.e. GUID will do and store this in a session or a cookie on the server.pli lipWhenever another function is called, it would require to pass this token which would then be validated against the tokens held in sessions or cookie on the server rather than having to validate it again our database. pli ol  pIf it passes, the rest of the function would execute otherwise, it would throw back an error and the logon function would require to be called again.p  ol liThe session or cookie would expires every x minutes.li ol  pQuestionsp  ol lipNow is the above too simplepli lipCan you use session with wcf rest services as we may not an asp.net website or other This would just run in IIS under http or https.pli lipAm I better off using cookies of some sort on the server instead of session, but can these expirepli lipWhen passing the token, can I just pass it as part of my json object or should I pass this as a custom header of some sortpli ol  pSorry if my suggestions or questions sound ridiculous or rather simplistic, but I know absolutely nothing about web authentication but everything Im reading seems complicated for what I want to achieve. As I said, it doesnt have to be over complicated. I just want to restrict users from using this web service if they are not authorized or granted permission.p  pCan you redirect me to a sample Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.p  pId like to implement this before releasing to our clients.p  pThanks.p  pThierryp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThis post actual has a good visual representation of what Im trying to achievep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2576509wcfrestbasedservicesauthenticationschemesWCF REST based services authentication schemesap

Negative 3421 pI am building a way for users to upload tracks with information about that track but I would like to do this asynchronously much like YouTube does. p  pAt the moment there is an API endpoint of codetrackscode that accepts a POST request with the uploaded file and all the meta data. It processes the track, validates everything and will then save the path to the track and all of its meta data in the database. This works perfectly but I am having trouble thinking of ways to do this asynchronously. p  pThe user flow will bep  p1 User selects a track and it starts uploadingp  p2 A form to fill in meta data shows and user fills it inp  p3 Track is uploaded with its metadata to the endpoint p  pThe problem is that the metadata form and the file upload are now two separate entities and now the file can finish uploading before the metadata is saved and viceversa. Ideally to overcome this both the track and metadata would be saved in the browser as a cookie or something until they are both completed. At that point both would be sent to the endpoint and no changes would be required at the back end. As far as I am aware there is no way of saving files client side like this. Oh apart from that filesystem API which is pretty much deprecated. p  pIf anyone has any good suggestions about how to do this it would be much appreciated. In a perfect world I would like there to be no changes to the back end at all but little changes are probably going to be required. Preferably no database alterations though.p  pOh by the way Im using codelaravelcode and codeember.jscode just in case anyone knows of any packages already doing this. p

Negative 3421 pI am trying to figure out which is the better way to go for our project. p  pPCL Library or Shared Project by Xamarin. p  pIn the a hrefhttpdeveloper.xamarin.comguidescrossplatformapplicationfundamentalsbuildingcrossplatformapplicationssharingcodeoptionsXamarin documentation link herea it says that a rule of thumb is to choose shared project when we will not share the library. The shared project can be written with ifs to make sure it works with multiple platforms  this also causes some issues with refactoring ifs not active.p  pYet I have a gut feeling it is not right to put this code to a shared class. If a code that is to be available to Windows, Android and IOS mobile platforms is using a shared project instead of PCL  it means we are using ifs inside shared project instead of writing platform specific code in a platform specific project. p  pThis is trying to make support of non PCL items via ifs and making the shared code more complex and harder to maintain. Shouldnt this be the work to be done by Xamarin for improving .NET PCL codebase p  pAnd also this means we are putting platform specific features in the shared project and not the platform specific project  i.e. hiding complexity for a specific platform from the platform project itself  which feels wrong in terms of architecture.p  pAm I right in that case I am conflicting with Xamarin documentation or am I missing somethingp

Its just difficult for me to visualize how exactly both commands can be inside the selfinvoking function but one runs only once, while the other runs every iteration.p

First, it couldnt find the nvcc compiler, so I did as suggested a hrefhttpaskubuntu.comquestions428234nvccnotfoundbutonlywhenusingsudoherea and created a symlink to nvcc in one of the directories listed in securepath, like this sudo ln s pathtonvcc sbinnvcc.p  pBut now Im trying to compile and keep getting the following error nvcc fatal Path to libdevice library not specified. p  pI guess that it has to do with the LDLIBRARYPATH variable that isnt set properly in root mode, but I cant find the way to solve it. Any ideasp

Negative 3421 pIm making a fairly simple app with the Netbeans Platform. I want to get rid off most of the stuff that comes by default in the menus. I know I can hide it with a layer.xml file, or something like that, but I dont want to have all this extra weight in my app if Im not using it.p  pIve got as far as finding out that I can deselect modules in the libaries tab of the project properties, and this will get rid of stuff in the menu, but its really hard to know what the modules do and which ones I dont want. For example, I know I dont want the Page setup... dialog in the file menu, but what module is providing that The core module sounds important, but its dependant on a lot of other modules, so keeping it is preventing me from removing those.p  pIs there any documentation that describes what the modules do and which menu actions they provide Or is there examples of sets of modules to have for particular types of appsp

Negative 3421 pI have written VBA code which takes a set of excel files and in turn opens them, refreshes the pivots, saves and closes the files.

If I manually Refresh All in the workbook there are no issues. QPS is the tab where the manual data and associated pivot are in this example p  pPlease note that I had to add a space between the path and the filename as the Stackoverflow code formatting removes the backslash after Pivots for some reasonp  pIt is also worth noting that the square brackets are not shown normally around the filename, they only seem to appear within this error message.

Negative 3421 pSo I have a task to write some pseudo code to program a frequency synthesizer. There are three main ports to this that I will utilize, Enable, Data, and Clock.p  pThe device is initially off, and when enable active low is triggered, the clock will cycle after some minimum setup time. Aside from the delays, I will have a function SendCommanduint32t addr, uint16t data.p  pThe issue that I am having, is that in the specifications given to me, the data is READ on a falling clock edge. This means that the data is read into the register at the address defined in the parameter, one bit at a time, and is kept on reading until the entire 16bit word has been written to the register. The clock cycles at about 10MHz. My questions arep  pstrongHow can I simulate the clock to cycle at 10MHz 100 nscyclestrongp  pstrongHow can I perform the data reading on the falling edge of said clock.strongp  pFor now ignore the writing aspect of the program, it is still just pseudocode.p

Negative 3421 pI have a recursive function which needs to recurse until it finds a certain result.  However in the body of my function after my first recursive call I might do some other calculations or possibly recurse again.  But, if I recurse and find the result Im looking for, then Id like to just stop out of any recursive Ive been doing and return that result to avoid doing unnecessary computations.p  pIn a normal recursive call once you get to the base case that gets returned to the function that called, then that gets returned to the one that called it, and so on.  Id like to know how to just return to the very first time the function was called, and not have to return something for all those intermediate steps.p  pFor my basic recursion I could write a function like thisp  precodedefun recurse x    if  x 10        returnfrom recurse x        progn recurse  x 1 print Recursed recurse 1 codepre  pIt has been written to illustrate what I mean about the function running more computations after a recursive call. And, as written this doesnt even return the value Im interested in since I do some printings after Ive returned the value I care about.  Note The returnfrom command is extraneous here as I could just write x in its place.  Its just there to draw parallels for when I try to return to the top level recursion in my second example below.p  pNow, if I want to ditch all those extra Recursed printings I could encase everything in a block and then just return to that block insteadp  pEDIT Here is a function wrapper for my original example.  This example should be clearer now.p  precodedefun recursetotop start   block toplevel     labels recurse x                if  x 10                    returnfrom toplevel x                    progn recurse  x 1 print Recursed       recurse start codepre  pAnd running this block keeps going until 10 is found and then returns to from the toplevel block with no extraneous printing, just like I wanted.  But, this seems like a really clunky way to get this feature.  Id like to know if theres a standard or best way for getting this type of behavior.p

I get the API response with httparty and then parse it with JSON.parse.p  pThe hash result is like multi level nested  around 56 levels  Initially, since Im new on ruby, I wanted to develop naturally, without thinking of number of methods, number of line in methods, the only goal was to clearly separate each extraction from another in distinct methods.p  pThe extraction from this nested hash is conditional extract, what I mean is there is multiples object of the same structure inside the hash.p  pAnd my extraction is like something like this  p  precode if  getflightjsonresponse  blablaid      storedblablaid  blablaid  end codepre  pthen laterp  precodegetdepartureplacefromflightjsonresponse, storedblablaid codepre  pI read many articles about obectifying hash like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20855664objectifyrubyhashesfromtojsonapithis good onea, or building some enginesextractor that getting value based on key passed in arguments.p  pSince Im getting a really huge json response,  and since Im not extracting all the values but specifics one, Im wondering if its not bad for usageperformance.p  pMy point   the class is working properly strongBUTstrong I have 25 methods in one class,  and the content of theses methods are like a direct access from the nested hash. I find it very ugly.p  pI was wondering since I have 2 request methods to the API, 1 method dedicated to construct URL, and the others one dedicated to extraction from the JSON response ,  is it appropriate to split the class into modules  p  pOr, is this kind of ugly class common in JSON parseextracting value from whatever APIsp
Negative 3421 pI found a tutorial on the android developer site for finding the location using google play services.

Here I tell it what kind of vote it needs to send to the file. up or down. Then when the startHandler is executed the second time, it does the insert correctly. The point is it doesnt do anything the first time with the first element in my array because as I know, I only give it the updownvote parameter the second time around.

Negative 3421 pI have an application in which the person who designed the application had used a dbml to manage db classes. But we have another database that we often need to connect to and weve been using ado.net normally to connect to it as we cannot use same dbml for it. However, I do not personally like using a LINQ database as the generated autocode causes errors whenever we add a new table or property. p  pIve been trying to implement a repository pattern with selfdeclared classes to map to each table but to manage operations on each table, we need a separate repository for each entity. Im not sure if Im on the right path using this pattern but if Im not using EF in this case, can we have a generic repository to represent the general operations or just create separate repository for each entity that we createp  pAlso, for generic repository, I would appreciate if I can get some example or pointers to it.p  pSorry if I sound redundant.

I have the connection string for the local DB in my Web.Conf file as follows p  precodeltconnectionStringsgt ltadd nameInterestedPersonDBContext connectionStringData SourceLocalDBv11.0AttachDbFilenameDataDirectoryInterestedPerson.mdfIntegrated SecurityTrue providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt codepre  pThen in my Web.Release.config I have transforms setup as followsp  precodeltconnectionStringsgt ltadd nameInterestedPersonDBContext      connectionStringServertcpu756l4y29q.database.windows.net,1433DatabaseSkillsMatrixDBUser IDMyIDPasswordMyPasswordTrustedConnectionFalseEncryptTrueConnection Timeout30      xdtTransformSetAttributes xdtLocatorMatchname gt codepre  pp  pThis setup works fine for running the application on both the LocalDB and the Azure hosted DB, however code first migrations only affect the local DB. Is there a way other than changing the connection string in the Web.Config file to have code first migrations also apply to the Azure DBp
Negative 3421 pI will have the following code structure in my Python script. But goto is ugly and not allowed to use in Python.p  pCould some one can suggest a prettier and more pythonic flow design to accomplish this p  pPS I tried to use recursive function call in exception handler, but the program ate plenty of memory after a while.p  precodetry      label login     logintosystem      label run     while True         query         calculate         update      Network exceptions might occur during login and queryupdate      Other exceptions might occur during querycalculateupdate but do not need to login again.  except SomeNetworkException      Need to log in to system again     go to label login except OtherExceptions     go to label run codepre  pUpdatedp  pIn this case, Network exceptions handler is shared by both login and other functions.p  pPreviously, I wrapped logintosystem function with a tryexcept block and wrote the same code in logins exception handler, but I felt it was ugly to have the same exception handler code twice in this block.p

I would like to flatten them whenever they are nested by adding in more of the parent element to wrap the randomElement and nodes separately, while making the target children into target siblings.

Please note that randomElement might be a div that is not a target class...p  pThis is for reformatting ebooks for paging in an online library, so there might be an enormous number of elements before we actually hit a problem div. Thus we need some way to select all the elements and texts nodes in between problem children divs as a group, because if they are all wrapped in their own divs, it does no good  we will wind up with every p, em or span as its own page.p  pAt the same time, most parent divs have no problem children. As long as the solution passes them through, I can clean up any empty divs with another run, but I do need this to work at least on a rudimentary  level with text that has no child elements as well.p  pThis is my first question on StackOverflow because I just dont get the recursion that would be necessary for this.p  pThanksp  pEDIT BASED ON THE ANSWER BY user52889.

Originally I did all the requests asynchronously, but sometime I will get OutOfMemoryException So I changed, sent the requests one by one, but it is too slow, takes long time to finish all requests. I wonder if there is a way that I can do 100 requests at a time asynchronously, once the data of all the 100 requests come back and plot in Excel, then send the next 100 requests. p  pThanks p  pEditbr On my addin, there is a ribbon button Refresh, when it is clicked, refresh process starts.p  pOn main UI thread, ribbonbutton is clicked, it will call web service BuildMetaData, once it is returned back, in its callback MetaDataCompleteCallback, another web service call is sentbr Once it is returned back, in its callback DataRequestJobFinished, it will call plot to plot data on Excel.  see belowp  precodeRefreshBtnClick      if cells  null return     Range firstOccurence  null      firstOccurence  cells.FindfunctionPattern, null,             null, null,             XlSearchOrder.xlByRows,             XlSearchDirection.xlNext,             null, null, null      DataRequest request  null     reportObj  null     Range currentOccurence  null      while Helper.RefreshCancelled                                              iffirstOccurence  null IsRangeEqualfirstOccurence, currentOccurence break          found  true  currentOccurence  cells.FindNextcurrentOccurence  firstOccurence          try                      var excelFormulaCell  new ExcelFormulaCellcurrentOccurence              if excelFormulaCell.HasValidFormulaCell                                                                                                                                    request  new DataRequestunityContainer, XLApp, excelFormulaCell                  request.IsRefreshClicked  true                 request.Workbook  Workbook                 request.Worksheets  Worksheets                  reportObj  new ReportBuilderunityContainer, XLApp, request, index, false                  reportObj.ParseParameters                  reportObj.GenerateReport                 this is necessary bc error message is wrapped in valid object DataResponse                 if string.IsNullOrEmptyreportObj.ErrorMessage Clear previous error message                                      ErrorMessage  reportObj.ErrorMessage                     Errors.AddErrorMessage                     AddCommentToCellreportObj                     Errors.RemoveErrorMessage                                                                    catch Exception ex                      ErrorMessage  ex.Message             Errors.AddErrorMessage             reportObj.ErrorMessage  ErrorMessage             AddCommentToCellreportObj             Errors.RemoveErrorMessage             Helper.LogErrorex                   codepre  pon Class to GenerateReportp  precodepublic void GenerateReport      Request.ParseFunction     Request.MetacompleteCallBack  MetaDataCompleteCallback     Request.BuildMetaData   public void MetaDataCompleteCallbackint id      try              if Request.IsRequestCancelled                      Request.FormulaCell.Dispose             return                   ErrorMessage  Request.ErrorMessage         if string.IsNullOrEmptyRequest.ErrorMessage                      queryJob  new DataQueryJobUnityContainer, Request.BuildQueryString, DataRequestJobFinished, Request                  else                      ModifyCommentOnFormulaCellPublishRefreshEvent                   catch Exception ex              ErrorMessage  ex.Message         ModifyCommentOnFormulaCellPublishRefreshEvent          finally              Request.MetacompleteCallBack  null          public void DataRequestJobFinishedDataRequestResponse response      Dispatcher.Invokenew ActionltDataRequestResponsegtDataRequestJobFinishedUI, response   public void DataRequestJobFinishedDataRequestResponse response      try              if Request.IsRequestCancelled                      return                   if response.status  Status.COMPLETE                      ErrorMessage  ManipulateStatusMsgresponse                  else  COMPLETE                      var tmpReq  Request as DataRequest             if tmpReq  null return              new VerticalTemplatetmpReq, response.Plot                    catch Exception e              ErrorMessage  e.Message         Helper.LogErrore          finally              if token  null             this.UnityContainer.ResolveltIEventAggregatorgt.GetEventltDataQueryJobCompletegt.Unsubscribetoken         ModifyCommentOnFormulaCellPublishRefreshEvent         Request.FormulaCell.Dispose       codepre  pon plot classp  precodepublic void Plot  ...     attributeRange.Value2  headerArray    DataRange.Value2  ....

Negative 3421 pI have run into a problem, and I am not sure how to resolve this, or if it can be. In my HTMLPHP page, a have a search form. When the user searches for something, instead of passing control to another page, Im using jquery to load another php page into a div container to perform the query and display results. The problem Ive run into is in terms of sorting the results. The way I generally handle sorting, is just to build the URL string containing the new sort parameters, and executeload that URL, which is the same page, just different sort parameters. But with the page that does the query being embedded into another page, I need to reload that page in the containing pages div. But since Im inside the embedded page, I have no access to that pages elements. p  precodelt  Container Page  gt ltdiv classrow searchformcontainer idsearchscriptscontainergt   ltdiv classcolxs3gt     ltdiv classinputgroup inputappend date dataprovidedatepickergt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtFROMltspangt       ltinput typetext classformcontrol idscriptfromdategt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtltspan classglyphicon glyphiconcalendargtltspangtltspangt           ltdivgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs3gt     ltdiv classinputgroup inputappend date dataprovidedatepickergt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtTOltspangt       ltinput typetext classformcontrol idscripttodategt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtltspan classglyphicon glyphiconcalendargtltspangtltspangt    ltdivgt   ltdivgt   lt search all input box gt   ltdiv classcolxs4gt     ltdiv classinputgroup inputappendgt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtSEARCHltspangt       ltinput typetext classformcontrol idscriptsearchall gt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs1gt     ltbutton typebutton classbtn btnprimary idsbmtscriptssearchgtQueryltbuttongt   ltdivgt ltdivgt     JQuery Function   sbmtscriptssearch.clickfunction       var fromdate  scriptfromdate.val      var todate  scripttodate.val      var searchstr  scriptsearchall.val.replace g,   convert spaces to underscores to pass in url      resultscontainer.loadsearchresults.phpfromdatefromdateamptodatetodateampsearchstrsearchstrampcol0amporderDESC       PHP Results Page    Create and execute query....     selection list to select field to sort by   ltdiv classrow stylemargin40px 0 5px 0gt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm8gt         ltdiv classcolsm9 alignrightgt             ltlabel forcolsortgtSort Byltlabelgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm3 stylepadding0gt             ltselect classsortselect idcolsort stylewidth100 padding0 margin0gt                 ltoption valuesearchprescriptionresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol0amporderltsortargs[0][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  1  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol1amporderltsortargs[1][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  2  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol2amporderltsortargs[2][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  3  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol3amporderltsortargs[3][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  4  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol4amporderltsortargs[4][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  5  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol5amporderltsortargs[5][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  6  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol6amporderltsortargs[6][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt             ltselectgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt ltdivgt     display query results   ltdiv classrow stylemargintop10pxgt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm8gt       ltdiv classpanel paneldefaultgt         ltdiv classpanelheadinggt           lta hrefview.phprxltbase64encodedata[number]gtgtdataltdatagtltagt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classpanelbodygt           ltdiv classcolsm6gt             ltpgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult1gtltbrgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult2gtltbrgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult3gtltbrgt             ltpgt           ltdivgt           ltdiv classcolsm6gt             ltpgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult4gtltbrgt                        ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult5gtltbrgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult6gt             ltpgt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pHere is the basics of whats going on..

Negative 3421 pIm relatively new to Javascript and I am having trouble understanding how to use a MongoDB callback with an ExpressJS get.  My problem seems to be if it takes too long for the database search, the process falls out of the app.get and gives the webpage an Error code ERREMPTYRESPONSE.  p  pCurrently it works with most values, either finding the value or properly returning a 404  not found, but there are some cases where it hangs for a few seconds before turning the ERREMPTYRESPONSE.  In the debugger, it reaches the end of the app.get, where it returns ERREMPTYRESPONSE, and after that the findOne callback finishes and goes to the 404, but by then it is too late.p  pIve tried using async and introducing waits with no success, which makes me feel like I am using app.get and findOne incorrectly.p  pHere is a general version of my code belowp  precodeapp.gettest, function req, res      var value  null     if req.query.param         value  req.query.param     else         value  defaultValue      var query  start lte value, end gte value     var data  collection.findOnequery, function err, data          if err             res.sendStatus500                  else if data              res.enddata                  else             res.sendStatus404                     codepre  pWhat can I do to have the response wait for the database search to complete  Or is there a better way to return a database document from a request  Thanks for the helpp

Negative 3421 pMy application is used to find place in a city.

Almost the exact same number as I get when applying the filter in Query Explorer, the difference I get of around 1 can be explained by the sampling. Ive tested it on multiple dates so Im sure this is whats happening. Applying the filter post aggregation instead of pre as in my first BigQuery query leads to a higher number of users because we had two web releases in this timeframe. So all users are being counted once for every version of web they used.p  pTo add One of the developers on my team wrote some Python script back in February which replicated the first BigQuery code written above a simple user count where the variableweb but instead hits the Core Reporting API and requests an unsampled report. Until March 5th 2015 the number of users we got using BigQuery versus the Python script were almost identical difference of 1 due to sampling. Then on March 5th they began to diverge, even for historical user counts, and instead our Python script started producing counts similar to the Query Explorer filters being applied post aggregation instead of pre.p  pMy questions are 1. What changed on March 5th 2. How do we replicate in Query explorer the first BigQuery code above Are we applying the variable filter correctly 3.

Something kind of likep  precodestdvectorltdoublegt subsectionofdata  data[0..2]  Obviously pseudocode codepre  pOkay so the above is nonsensical, because presumably a language which implemented that syntax would still make a copy operation, which is likely to be slow  exactly what I am trying to avoid...p  pSo yeah I am not sure exactly the best way to proceed here  can anyone suggest a good solution In the nonsubjective wayp  pEDIT To make this really clear  the problem is I dont want to do something likep  precodestdvectorltdoublegt r1temp r1temp.pushbackdata[0]  Copy  Bad  r1temp.pushbackdata[1] r1temp.pushbackdata[2]  ... same for an r2 ...  stdvectorltdoublegt force  magicgravityformular1, r2, m1, m2 codepre  pEDIT 2 Consider compiler options  would the compiler optimize my code for me by doing something like changing the function to accept arguments in the following wayp  precodestdvectorltdoublegt supergravityformuladouble x1, double y1, double z1, double x2, double y2, double z2, double m1, double m2 codepre  pIn which case, perhaps this question isnt important Other than form a make your code look nice to read point of view.p  pEdit 3 Therefore it is still important.p

Negative 3421 prom what i know i can either save it in a database or  through file io. The data has to be locally stored and i dont want data in datagrid view .  If i store the data through file handling then how can in store data in the directory where the software will be installed. I have tried service based database.mdf format and cant get it work. I need it for project. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 3421 pI have learned from a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvxHXn3Kg2IQE relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvxHXn3Kg2IQEa which is best approach for flow in application use service, content provider etc but I dont know what is best practice design pattern to work with data retried and data received. All data is in JSON.p  pSo I want to develop simple app. The app make request to server to login. In response I get token and JSON which describe a voting. After that I have to sent this complex JSON base on user input. This is kind of form to fill up. A voting system.p  precode   data      name Name of kind of voitng,    generaldata  [ name n1, value1, name n1, value1],    voits [name n1, value1, name n1, value1],    codepre  pSo I have classes which is mapped to this JSON. But I need also represent these data on the activity. So now I have two classes.p  precode    class GeneralDataElementJSON   String name  int value      class GeneralDataElementModel   String name  int value  boolean isVoited  false      class GeneralDataElementView extends View  codepre  pNow in my approach I map the retrieved data to instances of JSON classes after that I convert  instances of JSON classes into  instances of Model classes. The  instances of View classes are adapter for  instances of Model for display. p  pAfter user input I convert  instances of Model classes into  instances of  JSON classes and  instances of JSON classes using retrofit are converted to JSON and sent back to server.p  pSo it is complicated. I think that there should be better approach to do that. But howp

Negative 3421 pIm trying to edit my RSS feed email campaign in Mailchimp so that the images pulled from my blog are shrunk down to a usable size 540px. I use Squarespace, which unfortunately doesnt allow me to edit image sizes on the blog directly. Mailchimp insists on providing images at full size, so my RSS feed emails appear with 1500px wide images. I found some code that fixes the problem by using a style tag in Mailchimpbr  codeltstyle typetextcssgtimg, .mcnTextContent, .mcnTextContent img, .mcnTextContent p, .mcnTextContent p img, .mcnTextContent a img  maxwidth 500pximportant codebr However, Gmail doesnt recognize CSS and forces you to use inline tags.

Negative 3421 pI am writing a small C server to receive data from a ESP8266 module small wireless module. Specifically, I am curious about what I should be checking to look for a connection.

I would like my code to start a thread as soon as a connection is made, and hand off all handling of the connection to that thread regardless of whether or not data was sent.p  pI case that was not clear, let me break it down.p  pWhat is currently happeningp  pStart server  connect to server  nothing happens  send a string to server  server outputs thread started and the string sent.p  pWhat I want isp  pStart server  connect to server  server says thread started  send a string to server  server outputs the string sentp  pAlso if you guys could just review my code and let me know if you see any blatant errors or illogical things. I am learning sockets and threads at the same time p  pFYI, i searched far and wide for the answer before posting, namely here a hrefhttplbo.spheniscida.dedoclibsocketdoxygenhtmlgrouplibinetsocket.htmlgac85fdb9dc1530a93835e527ae0002652 relnofollowDocsap

Negative 3421 pIm using DTM to implement Adobe Analytics code on a single page app.p  pI have a link that weve set up successfully as an exit link and it fires as it should. If this matters, it opens in a new tab and we dont actually exit the website. However, any time we fire off any subsequent page views, we see the same event fired. Is there any way to fire off this event only when the link actually is clicked I assume that because its a one page app and the code isnt getting refreshed that is the reason its on every subsequent page. p

Negative 3421 pIm running Jenkins with the EC2 plugin. While running the init script, it often maybe 30 fails due to random network issues while downloading packages, etc. This leaves the node in an offline state forever, and also leaves the EC2 instance hanging around burning money I believe.p  pI have a workaround a job that runs hourly and cleans out the dead instances. But I feel like there must be a better way, either running the init script in a loop till it succeeds, or just terminating the instance upon failure. p  pIm sure I could probably add this myself to the source, or modify my init script to deal with, but I find it hard that no one has dealt with this before. Any suggestionsp
