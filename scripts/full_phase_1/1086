Positive 1086 pImagine you have a function in MATLAB of two variables, codefx,ycode. And it was written in a way that codexcode can be a scalar or a 1D array, but codeycode is strictly meant to be a scalar. For an array codexcode the function returns the array of elements of the same length as codexcode.p  pNext, you need to refactor this function to accept both codexcode and codeycode to be 1D arrays of equal length, the value of a function codef[x1,x1],[y1,y2]  [fx1,y1, fx2,y2]code.p  pHow would you do this in the most efficient wayp

Positive 1086 pIve been tasked to maintain and expand a codebase that heavily rest on Celery. This code needs to distribute several complex tasks, taking quite a long time each. Tasks were not designed as function, but directly as classes inheriting from Celery.p  pHowever, when you extend the task class from celery, your workers will create one and only one instance of the class, meaning that you severely pollute self. The previous developers found a clever solution involving metaclasses to avoid this behaviour and create a new instance each time a task need to be run. This is efficient, but the result gives a code that is rather hard to read and debug, and that strays far away from classical celery usages. Im also afraid it will prevent us from upgrading our versions of celery if new versions of celery make extensive changes.p  pI have the opportunity to refactor this code, but Im not sure if I should. The only solution I can think of is to transform the current Task classes into helper classes, and put the tasks themselves in simple functions that instantiate those helper classes and do the hard work. Are there any patterns to do this, or celery functionalities that I missed for this situation p  pN.B. this is pure celery, there is no Django in the mixp

If I have a method name in class codeFoocode and the name needs to be known by codeBarcode, it seems the best I can do isp  precodepublic class Bar      private String bazName  Foo.class.getMethodbazMethod, Qux.class      ...  codepre  pBut I havent actually achieved anything  I still have a string literal bazMethod which wont be refactored if the real codebazMethodcode gets renamed.p  pWhat I really want to do is something likep  precodepublic class Bar      private String bazName  tellMeTheMethodNamenew Foo.bazMethodnull      ...  codepre  pNot sure if this is possible somehow and if there is any way around it.p  pNow comes the real problem  even if you can sort that out as above, the real thing I am trying to access is an annotation attributeelement name.

Is it better to use a Switch statement whywhy notp  pBelow is my code to try and achieve the same functionality as the above but with a switch statement, was going to put it into a seperate method that gets called but i dont know how with the arrayList. p  precode    switch ArrayList vehicles      case a         vehicles  thislocation.getVehicleClassprestige Sedan         break     case b         vehicles  thisLocation.getVehicleClassLuxury Sedan         break     case c         vehicles  thisLocation.getVehicleClassFullsize Sedan         break     case d         vehicles  thisLocation.getVehicleClassMidsize Sedan         break     case e         vehicles  thisLocation.getVehicleClassHatchback         break     case f         vehicles  thisLocation.getVehicleClassCompact         break         default     vehicles  thisLocation.getVehicleClassCompact         break return vehicles  codepre  pIf you could please help me get this switch statement working to the same functionality as the if statement if possibleappropriate id greatly appreciate it.p
Positive 1086 pI started my scheduling app with a basic app template for my app, it worked pretty well. Initially, it was only for IVR, now it started to add multiple channels ivr, web, sms, etc. Each channel handles the user request differently and communicates the request in the requested channel, but all it does is scheduling. So, I started off with the following structure,p  precodebackend common frontend     modules         ivr         web         appt codepre  pFor me, appt is going to be the core module and will be used by all channel modules. ivr and web modules handles request from different channels. If someone requests for appt, how can I pass the request data to appt module and send the appts response back to userp  pIf it is an app without modules, it would be an instantiation of model and assigning form collected values to model, validate them, save and send the response in the request synchronously. How I can do the same, if my module depends on another module to perform validation and other business logicp  pCan anyone shed some light on my approach Should I go with module and just go back with the plain single app structurep  pstrongEditstrongp  pMy main confusion is whether IVR should go as a module or it should go as separate app as backend, frontend amp console app does with Yii2 advanced template. The other modules that Im considering are subscribe, script, notifier. Some modules are common to all channels and some others are specific to IVR. p  pWhen I considered appointment appt as module and attempted to make appt from web module, I got stuck at how to instantiate models amp retrieve error message.p  pI think modules should be loosed coupled, but for me, it appears to tightly integrated with other modules. What do you suggest from the followingp  ol lipevery purpose  feature as module and should be able to handle requests  response for all channels ivr, web, etcpli lipevery channel should be projected as module and should interact with feature modules.

Negative 1086 pI recently started learning Python and I was rather surprised to find a 1000 deep recursion limit by default.  If you set it high enough, about 30000, it crashes with a segmentation fault just like C.  Although, C seems to go quite a lot higher.p  pThe Python folks are quick to point out that you can always convert recursive functions to iterative ones and that theyre always faster.  Thats 100 true.  Its not really what my question is about though.p  pI tried the same experiment in Perl and somewhere around 10 million recursions it consumed all of my 4 gigs of ram and I used C to stop trying.  Clearly Perl doesnt use the C stack, but it does use a ridiculous amount of memory when it recurses  not terribly shocking considering how much work it has to do to call functions.p  pI tried in Pike and was completely surprised to get 100,000,000 recursions in about 2 seconds.  I have no idea how it did that, but I suspect it flattened the recursion to an iterative process  it doesnt seem to consume any extra memory while it does it. [Note Pike does flatten trivial cases, but segfaults on more complicated ones, or so Im told.]p  pI used these otherwise useless functionsp  precodeint fint i, int l  ifiltl return fi1,l return i   sub f  return f[0]1, [1] if [0]lt[1] return [0]   def fi,l    if iltl      return fi1,l    return i codepre  pIm very curious how other languages e.g., PHP, Ruby, Java, Lua, Ocaml, Haskell handle recursion and why they handle it that way.  Additionally, please note whether it makes a difference if the function is tailrecursive see comment.p

Negative 1086 pI recently had a problem during the deployment of a windows service.

Negative 1086 pIm trying to generate a vector graphic from an area in a bitmap image, and while my current algorithm works for most cases it has some problems and it is quite slow. p  pSo I was wondering if you people know of any simple algorithms or code examples of how to do this efficiently. p  pMy situation is simple. I have a bitmap image, with several flat uniform areas. I wish to convert these areas into sets of points that I can use to recreate them later as vector graphics.

Negative 1086 pI know a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32899howtogeneratedynamicunittestsinpythonsimilar questionsa have been asked before but they dont really have the information Im looking for  Im not asking about the mechanics of how to generate unit tests, but whether its a good idea.p  pIve written a module in Python which contains objects representing physical constants and units of measurement.  A lot of the units are formed by adding on prefixes to base units  e.g. from codemcode I get codecmcode, codedmcode, codemmcode, codehmcode, codeumcode, codenmcode, codepmcode, etc. And the same for codescode, codegcode, codeCcode, etc. Of course Ive written a function to do this since the end result is over 1000 individual units and it would be a major pain to write them all out by hand  It works something like this not the actual codep  precodedef addunitname, value     globals[name]  value     for pfx, multiplier in prefixes         globals[pfx  name]  multiplier  value  addunitm, ltdefinition of a metergt addunitg, ltdefinition of a gramgt addunits, ltdefinition of a secondgt  etc. codepre  pThe problem comes in when I want to write unit tests for these units no pun intended, to make sure they all have the right values. If I write code that automatically generates a test case for every unit individually, any problems that are in the unit generation function are likely to also show up in the test generation function. But given the alternative writing out all 1000 tests by hand, should I just go ahead and write a test generation function anyway, check it really carefully and hope it works properly Or should I only test, say, one series of units codemcode, codecmcode, codedmcode, codekmcode, codenmcode, codeumcode, and all other multiples of the meter, just enough to make sure the unit generation function seems to be working Or something elsep

Negative 1086 pIm creating an air application that allows the user to create, edit and save Objects in files. Im trying to implement a Save on Close prompt if the user hasnt saved her changes to the object before closing.p  pLets say I have a Class called MyClass marked as Bindable that is composed of fields, each exposing a getter and setter. Some of these fields are ArrayCollections of custom Classes. I want to consider a change a change to any of the fields, or any of the fields in any of the objects in any of the array collections the parent object is made up of.p  pI could manually dispatch an event anytime a setter is called on the MyClass object and manage this all manually, but Id also have to do it in a bunch of places in the application logic, for instance when the user changes one of the custom objects in one of the array collections that comprises it. This is a fine solution, but a little dirty and hard to maintain. I could also check the current object against a copy I made at the time of start up or last save, but I dont like the idea of doubling my memory footprint just for this.p  pI was hoping there was some event, perhaps an event that the binding broadcasts, that I could listen for in one place and manage my Saved variable. Does such a thing exist  I tried listening for the dataChange event that binding apparently dispatches, but I either did it wrong, or it doesnt do what I think it should. Is there a better optionp  pThanksp

Negative 1086 pI know that there are many different architectures exist. In this question I consider 3tiers architecture presentationservices busyness logicdata access layer DAOs. And I want to concentrate on how presentation tier works with services tier.p  pThe problem I met is standard. I have stateless services layer, and I think it should be stateless for the sake of scalability and performance.br  I also have stateful presentation layer. For example, when user fills some form and inputed values dont pass validation, its good practice to show all fields with inputed values and to point to incorrect fields.  p  pSo, imagine that we have codeFooBeancode with methods codesetFoo Foo fcode, codegetFoo code and codedoSave code. Bean has emSession scope.em br And we want to save persist new instance of Foo. What we do is call method setFoo  and then call method doSave . If saving failed than user will see just filled form with all inputed values getFoo  method is called.p  pThats nice, but now imagine that user clicks codeCreate Foocode link, fills all fields, tries to save but doesnt pass validation He will see filled form again. And then he clicks on Create Foo again he wants to create 2 Foo objects simultaneously. He will see filled form with pointed errors. But its bad, because he didnt fill this second, new form yet.p  pIf we change FooBean scope to codeRequestcode, than we wont be able to show filled form when its necessary after saving failed.p  pSo, what is the way out What is the correct solution It can be JSFspecific or general.p

Negative 1086 pIm integrating with some existing, legacy Perl code for my current project.  Im downloading some libraries via CPAN to use in a Perl script, but I would like to avoid having all the other developersusers install these libraries manually.  Taking a page from my RubyRails background, I thought it might be possible to unpack the dependencies to a local directory thats under version control and then load the libraries from there.  The advantages are that 1 no one has to install specific packages manually and 2 you know everyone has the same version and can update that version easily.p  pI tried the easy approach and just moved the installation files to code.vendorPerlPodcode, code.vendorPerlDBDcode, code.vendorPerlWin32code, etc and adjusted codeINCcode accordingly.  This worked fine for some libraries but not others.  I would guess compiled libraries are causing problems, as well as dependencies.p  pIs there already a solution out there that solves this problem for me  The core of it is that I dont want to manually manage dependencies between developers or users which we have to do now.p  pIm not terribly familiar with Perl, so I apologize for my ignorance in advance.p

Negative 1086 pAny creative ideas to avoid deadlocks on a yield or sleep with cooperativenonpreemptive multitasking without doing an OS Thread.Sleep10 Typically the yield or sleep call will call back into the scheduler to run other tasks. But this can sometime produce deadlocks.p  pSome backgroundp  pThis application has enormous need for speed and, so far, its extremely fast as compared to other systems in the same industry. One of the speed techniques is cooperativenonpreemptive threading rather then the cost of a context switch from OS threads.p  pThe high level design a priority manager which calls out to tasks depending on priority and processing time. Each task does one iteration of work and returns to wait its turn again in the priority queue.p  pThe tricky thing with nonpreemptive threading is what to do when you want to a particular task to stop in the middle of work and wait for some other event from a different task before continuing.p  pIn this case, we have 3 tasks, A B and C where A is a controller that must synchronize the activity of B and C.  First, A starts both B and C. Then B yields so C gets invoked. When C yields, A sees they are both inactive, decides its time for B to run but not time for C yet.  Well B is now stuck in a yield that has called C, so it can never run.p

Negative 1086 pI have a warehouse in which I keep goods. Each article occupies given volume of warehouse space and costs give amount of dollars.p  pNow, because warehouse is full and Im expecting new delivery, I have to free some space  no less than the new delivery will occupy, but I also have to minimize my loses. In other words, I have to empty at least X cubic meters of warehouse space by throwing out some articles, making sure that value of those articles is the minimum value possible.p  pExample If X10m3, then I prefer to throw out item that occupies 20m3 and is worth 1000 than item that occupies exactly 10m3 but is worth 2000. Of course in the real calculation it will be necessary to throw out more than one item, probably 5, 10 or maybe even 20.p  pWhat Im thinking of is to represent the above problem as a tree, with nodes representing volume of emptied space and edges representing codelost valuecode, then searching for nodes that have value greater or equal to X and then choosing the node that has the lowest codelost valuecode along the edges from tree root to that node.p  pWhat Im not sure if this is good approach because for e.g. 100 items in warehouse full tree would have 100 nodes on first depth level, 100999900 nodes on second level etc, so this quickly starts to be prohitibive.p  pIs there better approach, or maybe even some proven algorithm that Im not aware of for such kind of problemsp

Negative 1086 pI have always used Visual Studios built in GUI support for configuring my projects, often using property sheets so that several projects will use a common set.p  pOne of my main gripes with this is managing multiple projects, configurations and platforms. If you just do everything with the main GUI right click the project  properties it quickly becomes a mess, difficult to maintain and prone to bugs like failing to correctly define some macro, or using the wrong runtime library, etc. Dealing with the fact that different people put there dependency libraries in different places eg mine all live in CLibs[C,C][libname] and then often manage the different versions of those libraries differently as well release, debug, x86, x64, etc is also a large problem since it vastly complicates the time to set it up on a new system, and then there is issues with versioncontrol and keeping everyones paths separate...p  pProperty sheets make this a bit better, but I cant have one sheet have separate settings for different configurations and platforms the drop down boxes a greyed out, resulting in me having many sheets which if inherited in the correct order do what I want x86, x64, debug, release, common, directories deals with the previously mentioned dependency issue by defining user macros like BoostX86LibDir, etc and if inherited in the wrong order eg common before x64 and debug lead to issues like trying to link an incorrect library version, or incorrectly naming the output...p  pWhat I want is a way of dealing with all these scattered dependencies and setting up a set of rules which are used by all my projects in the solution, like naming an output library as mylib[vc90,vc100][x86,x64][d].lib, without having to do all this for each individual project, configuration and platform combination, and then keep them all correctly in sync.p  pI am aware of moving to entirely different systems like CMake that create the needed files, however this then complicates things elsewhere by making it so even simple tasks like adding a new file to the project then requires additional changes elsewhere, which is not something I am entirely happy with either, unless there is some with VS2010 integration which can keep track of these sorts of changes.p

There are 3 children of the ViewFlipper, and each is a ScrollView.  Theyre all dynamically populated when the Activity loads, and they dont change after that.  The ScrollView is where the SimpleOnGestureListeners are attached.  p  pHeres the layout Im usingbr ViewFlipperbr ScrollView x3, one for each page, each with the followingbr LinearLayout verticalbr TextViewbr TableLayout dynamically populated wTableRowsbr View  p  pI extended the onFling method with the common tutorial code you can find anywhere online, and it works greatexcept when one of the ScrollViews doesnt contain enough content to scroll.  p  pIve narrowed the problem down to touch detection by overriding and calling super on every one of the SimpleOnGestureListeners methods to add a printtolog.  p  pWhen I swipe on a page that scrolls, I get something full of in onClick in onScroll in onFling etc.  On a page thats too short to scroll, I get in onClick in onShowPress in onLongPress, and thats only if Im touching the content emwithinem the tooshort scrollviews childrenif I touch elsewhere I get no events at all.  p  pIdeas on whats wrong, or how to detect the swipe gesture no matter how big the ScrollView isp  pEDIT  Ive determined that when I run this on an Android 2.2 emulator, as opposed to the Android 2.1u1 DroidX emulator Ive been using, it goes away.  This is reproducible across multiple environments.p  hr  pI have some more insight on this  it seems as though onInterceptTouchEvent is not called for every motion event when a scrollview is contained within a flipper or a WorkspaceView.p  pIn particular, the behavior I found while modifying another view class to fix this very same issue it is not unique to flippers was as followsnote that this is Android 2.1 onlyp  pIf the scrollview is long enough to scroll, the ACTIONDOWN motion event is caught by the ScrollView, and every subsequent ACTIONMOVE event goes through onInterceptTouchEvent of the flipper, where it is intercepted and handled appropriately.  In android 2.2, this behavior happens regardless of the scroll length.p  pBack to 2.1  If the scrollview is not long enough to scroll, the ACTIONDOWN motion event is emnotem caught by the scrollview, but instead comes back to the onTouchEvent of the flipper.  All subsequent ACTIONMOVE events of the same gesture emskipem the onInterceptTouchEvent function and go straight to the onTouchEvent functionp  pThe way I resolved this was to take the functionality I had in onTouchEvent for ACTIONMOVE events and refactor it into its own method.  In this way, I can have onTouchEvent call onInterceptTouchEvent followed by that functionality if it detects that the event has previously gone unhandled.p  precodecase MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE                  if touchState  TOUCHSTATESCROLLING                      handleScrollMoveev                  else                    Log.dworkspace,caught a move touch event but not scrolling                     NOTE  We will never hit this case in Android 2.2.  This is to fix a 2.1 bug.                     We need to do the work of interceptTouchEvent here because we dont intercept the move                     on children who dont scroll.

In the case that we receive a move event, and we are scrolling which only happens if we have deliberately chosen to intercept itie, its set in the intercept function, so weve been to the intercept function already we perform the move behavior we desire.  If we receive a move event here and we are not scrolling, then we send the event back through onIntercept, and then see if were now set to scrolling.  If so, we perform the action.p  pIts not elegant, but it worksp

Negative 1086 pIm using Delphi 72010 and trying to figure out a good way to handle exceptions while freeing forms of an application.  The application has several forms that are owned by the Application object.  When the user logs out, I need to free all of the existing forms so no user state is maintained and then show the login dialog for the next user who logs in.p  pOccasionally, an exception happens while trying to free one of the forms.  That leaves the form in memory, but in an unknownunusable state, so I cant reuse the form for the next user, and I also cant get rid of it from memory.  Because the forms are owned by the application, I cant directly create a new version of the form for the next user, since it would cause the A component named MyForm already exists error from the VCL, and Im bit averse to having old form instances in memory anyway.p  pId like to see what others would do in this case.  Here are some ideasp  ul liTerminate the application when you get these exceptions, so you are sure to wipe the slate clean.  The user is logging out anyway, so they are likely done with the app.  Optionally restart the app if desired.li liMake the forms not owned by the Application, so you can create multiple instances of them, and make sure any nonfreeablebroken forms are at least hidden.li liDynamically generate the name of each form, or set it to blank, so there are never duplicate names, and no already exists errors from the VCL.li liWrite an application so well that there are never exceptions when freeing objects unrealistic  I need a contingency plan for unexpected errors.li ul  phr bMy Solutionb was one of the original ideas above.  I added a tryexcept block around the loop that frees the forms, and if there is an exception, I show the error message to the user without raising it, and then call ExitProcess0 to immediately kill the application.p

Negative 1086 pI have a set of objects which can be members of one or more of a low number of sets think objects which can sit in several positions inside a tree. Since these assignments need to be queried often and quickly, we store them as a single constellation id in the object, and then keep a table with constellation ids where each constellation is mapped to a number of sets this also saves us from some trouble regarding distinctness, in contrast to an INNER JOIN sets WHERE set in ... approach which might seem more obvious.p  pExample object 1 and 2 are both assigned to sets 3 and 4. Instead of keeping an nm listp  precodeobject id  set id 1           3 1           4 2           3 2           4 codepre  pwe store a constellation id 5 for object 1 and 2, then have a table assigning sets 3 and 4 to constellation 5. Since objects tend to be assigned to common combinations of sets, this is feasible in practice, i.e. we dont need to keep the whole worstcase scenario of 2sets different constellations around.p  pQuerying for all objects within at least one of the currently visible sets s1, s2, ... we find all constellations containing s1 or s2 or ..., and then create a query codeWHERE constellation IN constellation1, constellation2, constellation3, ...codep  pNow were moving from Access to SQL Server, and the question is whether we should change this approach as we ARE in fact starting to create larger and larger INclauses. p  pMy question is Would this be a usecase for a stored procedure Id like to have a stored procedure like p  blockquote   pSELECT  FROM objects WHERE IsInSets1, s2p blockquote  pwhere this list of sets is translated into the corresponding set of constellations, and the function returns true if the objects constellation is contained in this set. Since Im just moving to SQL Server and have never actually used stored procedures, any feedback on whether this would make sense would be highly appreciated. Specifically, Im wondering if MSSQL would be to optimize this in a way that the constellationtoset table becomes cached, as were currently doing manually for the creation of the queries.p

Negative 1086 pIm taking a stab at a large program with a background Service and Im implementing a rather poorly thought out Message handling procedure using basic Handler objects.  The application has a main menu with buttons which start 6 different activities.  p  pProblem is this if i start a worker thread which kicks off a query to the database and retrieves some data, and I close the Activity that started the aforementioned worker thread, the Handler in the Activity still tries to run and show a dialog, even though the Activity that created it is now finished or not in focus.  How can I tell whether the current Activity is in focus before committing any UI changesp  pI ended up solving the issue by simply putting the showDialog call in a try statement, but id like a more sophisticated solution, as this just seems like the wrong way to do things.p

Negative 1086 pi posted a question similar to this one a month ago but since i got no answers and the problem is more clear now, ill try again. Its a bit hard for me to explain in english, i hope my question is understandablep  pSo, i have this SMTP server which i dont own that is storing its users passwords in ASCII. In my .NET application, im using the System.Net.Mail.SMTPClient class to send the emails but i cant authenticate sucessfully in said server because whatever i do in my code, the SMTPClient keeps Base64Encoding the password as if the input is in UTF8... and so, any password with characters after 127 keep mismatching ex a password with the char  is sent as  by the SMTPClient instead.p  pHow can i fix this Is this a problem in the SMTP client implementation or is it the servers fault Or am i missing something here Thanksp
Negative 1086 pI have a javascript application that loads data asynchronously from a server within my companys firewall.  We sometimes need to show this application outside of the firewall but it is not always possible to get on the VPN.  For this reason, we configured the firewall to allow public requests for this data on a specific port.  The catch when I am inside the corporate network, I can only load data using the servers DNS name due to a peculiar configuration of the firewall.  Outside of the corp network, I have to use the servers public IP address..p  pCurrently we distribute two versions of the javascript application  one which works within the firewall and one that works outside of it.  We would like to distribute one app  one that tests the URLs and then, depending on which is reachable, continue to use that address to load data.  p  pI have been using jQuerys code.ajaxcode call to load the data and I noticed there is a codetimeoutcode parameter.  I thought I could use a short timeout to determine which server is unreachable..  However, this countdown doesnt seem to start until the initial connection to the server is made.p  pAny thoughts on how to determine, in javascript, which of two servers is reachablep

Negative 1086 pI am planning on writing a rails application which will distribute tasks to several workers on different computers. I am trying to review the different technologiesgems available to use and Im having trouble deciding which combination best suites my needs. p  pHeres what I know so far The application will need to be fault tolerant and not lose tasks even if the worker is forcibly turned off. The number of tasks isnt high, but the amount of time each task will take will vary it could be relatively short or may take a long time. p  pIve seen Celery for python do something very close to what I need, but Id like to give this a try in Ruby where it can requeue tasks in RabbitMQ if any worker is killed off.

Negative 1086 pI have a simple application where I am displaying the tree list in a dialog box for the users to pick and have a little servlet in background for lazy loading. The problem happens for me when I click on one of the directories. This directory contains 4000 other directories. The scroll bar becomes very hard to scroll down, slowing down measurably. p  pI have a solution to group things on the screen so that the users see the first couple characters of the directories and then slowly let them drill down.

Negative 1086 pOur project uses a macro to make logging easy and simple in oneline statements, like sop  precodeDEBUGLOGTRACELOGLEVEL, The X value   ltlt x ltlt , pointer   ltlt x codepre  pThe macro translates the 2nd parameter into stringstream arguments, and sends it off to a regular C logger.  This works great in practice, as it makes multiparameter logging statements very concise.  However, Scott Meyers has said, in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0321334876 relnofollowEffective C 3rd Editiona, You can get all the efficiency of a macro plus all the predictable behavior and type safety of a regular function by using a template for an inline function Item 2.

Is there any way I can have these data dynamically queried  on the client side of coursep  pI tried using IronPython to embed my Python code in my webpage, but it was complaining about failing to find the lxml imported library. But a similar solution would be great. Or a library in pure javascript which allows for opening and parsing external webpages...p  pThanksp

Negative 1086 pI am trying to resolve a 100 cpu usage by the SQL Server process on the database server. While investigating, I have now come across the fact that the stored procedures are taking the most worker time. p  pFor the following query of dmvs to find queries taking highest time, p  precodeSELECT TOP 20 st.text                ,st.dbid                ,st.objectid                ,qs.totalworkertime                ,qs.lastworkertime                ,qp.queryplan FROM sys.dmexecquerystats qs CROSS APPLY sys.dmexecsqltextqs.sqlhandle st CROSS APPLY sys.dmexecqueryplanqs.planhandle qp ORDER BY qs.totalworkertime DESC codepre  pmost of them are stored procedures. The weird thing is that all these stored procedures are querying different tables. And yet they are the top of taking the most worker time, even though when I look at the Profiler for queries with top CPU, Reads, Duration, the stored procedures dont figure at the top there. p  pWhy could this be happeningp  pEdit The application actually uses adhoc queries more than stored procedures. Some of these procedures are to be migrated to using adhoc queries. The thing is that these procedures are not called as often as some of the other queries, which are cpu intensive, and are called very frequently.  Also, it does strike me odd that a stored procedure with which does a simple select a,b,c from tbl where idid would have a higher total worker time than a query which has mulitple joins, user defined functions in the where clause, a sort and a rownumber over and while the simple one queries a table with 20000 records, the complex query is on a table with over 200,000 records. p

Negative 1086 pI have some troubles with using boostlocale 1.49 on Debian 7 GNULinux version of GCC is 4.6.31. The code is saved in cp1251.

Heres the codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  include ltboostlocale.hppgt  int main     boostlocalegenerator gen   stdlocale locgen.generateruRU.cp1251   unsigned char debug501     bool debug500  stdisalphadebug501, loc   stdcoutltlt debug500    return 0  codepre  pIt runs with no exception on Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008.

Negative 1086 pWe have a BI team that have created a wonderful data warehouse that works fine for the internal staff using it through Excel on the internal network.  They use windows authentication through the domain controller, and everything works fine, including restricting the access to users and AD Groups.p  pThe issue is that we now want to provide the same access to a wider audience that is not part of our Windows Domain.  This is further complicated by the fact that the information on the users that need access to the system is already stored in another location an application with a SQL database.p  pThe goal is to make it so that they connect probably using HTTPS to the cube using Excel Analysis services integration, and be authenticated using the UsernamePassword that they had in the main application.p  pThe main application has a WCF Service interface for user authentication, and session management, so all I really need is a way to provide authentication in front of the MSMDpump.dll against that WebService.  We can also add in a Role Mapping so that we can define the SSAS roles against the users in the application.p  pI was thinking that I could create a dll that has the same interface as the MSMDPUMP.dll, and have that translate calls between the client and the main dll, but this seems a bit of overkill.p  pAre there any prebuilt tools to do this and yes I know that Sharepoint can do something like this, but thats not an option so please dont suggest it.  Does anybody know of any blogs detailing how to do itp  pAny pointers in where to start with creating an interface between the 2p  pThe question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions126350howtosecuremsssas2005forhttpremoteaccessviainternetHow to secure MS SSAS 2005 for HTTP remote access via Interneta however, Im looking at providing the authentication mechanism from another datasource, and providing the Roles to SSAS, not the users.  We dont want to have to setup a new user in SSAS for every user that is setup in the external application.p  pUPDATE To be clear, they external users need to connect to the cube using Excel, and the data returned needs to be filtered by the role theyre in and the security applied in the Cube. We are able to cahnge the cube to use Dynamic Dimension Security and use CustomData attributes if that helps.p

Negative 1086 pThis might be a straight forward answer, and I know that you dont emhaveem to set NSObject as the Superclass when creating a new class.p  pBut say, for example, I wanted to create a class which held a set of custom CABasicAnimations. Although it may be perfectly ok for me to use CABasicAnimation as the superclass, is it recommended that I follow the unwritten rule and still use NSObject or would you, if you were writing such a class, use CABasicAnimation as the Superclassp  pI would assume that it wouldnt matter as long as the Class only contained properties and methods relative to CABasicAnimation.p  pIt would be interesting to here your thoughtsp

However, anything more than 1300, I seem to have no difference. I.e. 19001 does not call it once every 19001th of a second.p  pThe way it works is that it increases the y coordinate 4 pixels relative to the balls position, and it does this once every 1300th of a second, hence why it doesnt lag at this rate. This is basically an easy mode for the player. If I want to do a hard mode, I need to make the NPC more accurate. I can do this by doingp  precodeself.player2.centery  self.player2.centery  20 codepre  pSomething like this. This would be extremely accurate. HOWEVER, it does NOT look fluid, it looks laggy. I assume I could get the same amount of movement by emcalling the method more oftenem instead of changing the amount it moves via altering the pixel movement. However, I dont know how to do this, because, as I said, changing it from anywhere above 1300 seems to make no difference. p  pThis is how I use my paddlep  precodeif touch.x lt self.width3     self.player1.centery  touch.y codepre  pand I can move it as fast as I want because this updates as I move the mouse. And it looks fluid because it updates as often as it needs to update. I dont know how to do this with my AI.p  pDoes anyone know how I could basically make the NPC paddle more accurate, allowing me to do EasyNormalHard, etc, while retaining fluidity and no lag I see only one way I could do it Increase the amount the method is called. p  pHowever I bet there is a better way and I dont know how to do it. Does anyone have any Idea how I could do this Thanks.p  pEdit it looks like I can do it like thisp  precodeClock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300      Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300  Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300  Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300          Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300  codepre  pBut that seems REALLY ugly and REALLY inefficient...

Negative 1086 pemForgive me if this is a very basic question, but Im hoping someone here can explain it very clearly for a beginner to JS.emp  pI noticed that Ive used the same code in two places and therefore made a function to fire. But I want to use a variable that I created in this function to use after its been completed. Heres a code examplep  precodefunction calculateanimationdirection      var theWidth  parseIntvisibleArea.outerWidth  70,         currentMargin  parseIntlistingsSlider.cssmarginleft,         hoursVisible  Math.floortheWidth  itemWidth,         hoursWidth  itemWidth  hoursVisible,         newMargin  currentMargin  hoursWidth    forwardBtn.clickfunction       calculateanimation       animate the slider     listingsSlider.animate         marginleft newMargin  px       codepre  pSo I created a new variable called codenewMargincode in the codecalculateanimationcode function, and Im trying to use it in the animate function below.p  pWhat do I need to do to make this happenp
Negative 1086 pSay, my codeclass Personcode collaborates with other classes, codeKettlecode and codeTeacupcode.p  pcodePersoncode has a method codemakeTeacode that should interact with codeKettlecode and codeTeacupcode, each in different ways, in succession, but the order is unimportant.I would like to capture interactions between the codePersoncode and codeKettlecode, and the interactions between codePersoncode and codeTeacupcode individually in two separate unit tests lets call them codetestPersonFillsKettleWithWatercode and codetestPersonPoursBoilingWaterIntoTeacupcodep  pTo test the method codemakeTeacode it is not necessary to have codeKettlecode nor codeTeacupcode. When testing for interactions with codeKettlecode, any interactions codeTeacupcode dont matter.p  pWith ScalaMock however if you do not declare expectations on codeTeacupcode and yet some interactions occur, then codeTeacupcode throws tantrums about Unexpected method calls etc.p  pIn a hrefhttpscode.google.compjmockit relnofollowjMockita literature this is called setting strict expectations. I would like to be able to omit specifying every expectation, and just test for certain interactions within one method. So the question isp  pstrongDoes ScalaMock support nonstrict expectationsstrongp  pIm aware of the codemock stub methodcode syntax, but it is cumbersome to list out all the expectations that I find myself having to list.p

Negative 1086 pThis question doesnt relate to a problem that Ive had yet, but it keeps me up at night.  Theoretically, eventually, as the number of rows in a table goes up and up and up, the ID corresponding to each row will run out of numbers, wont it  I guess that if you keep adding depth to the column value, you could keep it going up, but eventually there must be an upper limit, rightp  pIve heard of a technique called sharding but havent had it explained in enough detail to satisfy my curiosity.  Is the answer that you just keep adding more numbers, or is there a clever pattern to allow repeat IDs in their own sandbox.  What if these sandboxes have to interactp

Negative 1086 pHaving searched the site, I think the issue Im having may relate to using innerHTML to populate a codeltdivgtcode but I cant quite find a solution that I can map onto my specific issue. Hope someone can help. Basically, I have an HTML page that contains a form with a text field. The page also contains an empty codeltdivgtcode which will be populated with a tableofcontents in a moment. The codeltdivgtcode is defined asp  precodeltdiv idtocmenu classmenulistgt codepre  pIve set the onkeyup attribute of the form text field to run a Javascript function defined in the HTML codeltheadgtcode which defines a XMLHttpRequest and sends the value entered in the text input field str to a PHP page using codexmlhttp.openGET,tocitems.phpfilterstr,truecode. The PHP page GETS the value of filter and runs a MySQL query. It then produces some results which are echoed back to the empty  as a tableofcontents with main headings and subheadings usingp  precodedocument.getElementByIdtocmenu.innerHTMLxmlhttp.responseText codepre  pThis works moreorless as expected. The length of the returned tableofcontents changes as text is entered into the text field. There is, however, a problem. This tableofcontents is supposed to  have an accordion effect created using a script which is defined in the HTML codeltheadgtcode. The script was developed by Roshan Bhattarai and works beautifully when the tableofcontents list is hardcoded into the HTML page. The script is as followsp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     lt            Developed by Roshan Bhattarai       Visit httproshanbh.com.np for this script and more.

Negative 1086 pSay I have two classes with different names but the exactly same structure. It there a way to cast an object of the one class to one of the otherp  pThis might sound stupid to do but there is a reason why I want to do that. The architecture of my application provides the abstract classes codecomponentcode and codestoragecode The ready application will contain several specialized components derived from codecomponentcode and each of them will define its own storage type, derived from codestoragecode. During initialization of the application, for each component there will be a storage object of its custom storage type created and passed as pointer to the component.p  pThis way all component stay completely independent which is great for reusability and testing. But, of course, there is a need to exchange informations between components. To do that with independence in mind, I want to let two components get a storage pointer pointing to the same storage. The pointer by constraint must be of the component specific storage type.p  pframework code abstract classesp  precodeclass Storage   class Component  public     void SetStorageStorage storage private     Storage storage  codepre  pexample componentp  precodeclass PhysicsStorage  public Storage class PhysicsComponent  public Component codepre  panother componentp  precodeclass CollisionStorage  public Storage  same structure as PhysicsStorage as both components need the same data like world coordinates and rotations of all forms in the 3d space class CollisionComponent  public Component codepre  pmain applicationp  precodeinclude system.h  PhysicsStorage Worlddata  PhysicsComponent Physics CollisionComponent Collision  Physics.SetStorageampWorlddata Collision.SetStorageampWorlddata  this points to a PhysicsStorage but that is actually the same like a CollisionStorage which is expected codepre  pSo I wonder if there is a way of casting the pointer of say codePhysicsStoragecode to codeCollisionStoragecode. In this case, both are defined in the file of their related component class. And both are derived from abstract codeStoragecode.p  pI only want to do that in the case that both custom storage types have exactly the same structure. Otherwise it would be senseless. I am not so familiar with advances pointer usage so I wonder if there is a way to do that. What I know is that you can cast to a base class, but this isnt what I want here. Using a shared storage type for two components would break independence. Thanks a lotp

Negative 1086 pI have a fairly simple class that represents a game being created by a player for another player, before they game is sent to the other player by the server I would like to implement a sort of persistence in case something goes wrong i.e a crash. So the current state of the game they are creating is saved so they can just resume creation if something goes awry.p  pLooking through the various ways to save objects and such it seems, NScoding with NSKeyedarchiver is my best bet as it is not a massive amount of data... My question is can you then delete anything saved though NSCoding as i do not want to retain the object on the phone once it has been successfully sent to the other player as at the moment my thoughts are to check if there is anything saved on start up and if there is anything it represents a game in creation unfinished, this is also assuming i am saving to [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults].p  pAnother question can you save more than one of the same object to standardUserDefaults and it knows how to differentiate between them or do they just override if this is the case i may have to consider unique file paths for each.p  pthere are many other questions but these are the most important ones and will hopefully convey my idea across enough to get a some what clear answer.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEDIT So i know you can delete docs so this may pretty much be answered i will report back when i get it working in the meantime any insights would still be helpful as to maybe speed up my approach.p

Doing the same thing on an Internetfacing test server i.e. accessible from the Internet works fine.  p  pSo my question is, in order for a Like to appear on the users timeline and the Send button to work, does Facebook need to be able to directly connect to my serverp  pSomeone else wrote the code, so Im not sure if this is helps.

Negative 1086 pI have been asked to create summary worksheets for excel files that I dont populate. These are monthly excel files with the worksheets usually named as to the week commencing date. I say usually as a spelling mistake might creep in or such that wont allow the sheet names to be predicted in advance of their creation. The worksheet wont be created until the week in question has begun.p  pWhat I am trying to do, though struggling with, is create some VBA code to copy a number of cells and ranges from each worksheet to a summary worksheet which will be hidden. The worksheets all follow the same formatting, the main info being A1 as the weekstart date, O4 to R4 as 4 summary column headers and N5 to N30 as username info. O5 to R30 then has counts in them depending on the data within the worksheet.p  pI want to create some code that copies the weekstart date A1 alongside each username that is not blank N5N30 and the values after in the corresponding row. As the column headers in O4 to R4 dont change these can stay static on the summary sheet.p  pAfraid I dont know too much about vba. I guess I would use Worksheets.Count to find the number of worksheets Was going to modify the code on a hrefhttpwww.ozgrid.comVBAsheetindex.htm relnofollowherea but I dont know how to ensure each row of data goes on a new line in the summary worksheetp

Negative 1086 pIve noticed when using jQuery.fn.animate I can pass some or all of the parameters css for animation, callback function, easing, and duration in any order to the function.p  pLooking into the function source code, it starts like thisp  precodefunction prop, speed, easing, callback      var empty  jQuery.isEmptyObjectprop,         optall  jQuery.speedspeed, easing, callback, . . . codepre  pAnd then it starts to actually process the information passed.

Negative 1086 pIm looking for a solution for a Java based webapplication to uniquely identify the client. The server is in the same network as the clients and I thought that using the MAC address would be a good solution.  The problem is I cant work with cookies because they can be deleted clientside and I cant use the IP because they could just issue a new DHCP lease renewal.p  pSo I would like to fallback to the MAC address of the clients. Im aware that there is no java built in feature to get the MAC address.

However, I think it is probably a better fairer approach at least in the setting of the example.

Further, the lecturer has rated the required skillset for every project.

That was easy  replace the clientid field with a new table ItemClientsitemid, clientid and join on itemid.p  pThe problem is now the reports  of course each item is duplicated for each time there is a client, BUT i WANT ONLY ONE COPY OF THE ITEM IN THE REPORT  irrespective of how many clients there are to an item.  Also, there is the ability to filter the report by client, which I can do fine in MySql and worked fine in the previous singleclient version.p  pMy solution is to add a group by itemid clause to the query MySql allows this.  The problem is how to add the group by clause to the report.  Any attempt to group gets interpreted as a report grouping, which I dont want.

Negative 1086 pIm an embedded C developer who has recently started messing with C code on an embedded device and am unsure about how constcorrectness applies when a class accesses volatile data such as memorymapped registers or data on an external device, such as an AnalogtoDigital Converter ADC.p  pFor example, I have classes that interface to the devices hardware modules by accessing its memorymapped registers through a pointer, like sop  precodeclass IOPin  public      Constructor, destructor, other methods...       should this be a const method     bool ReadIOState return portregsgtstate  private      Other private stuff...       Constructor points this to the right set of memorymapped registers     volatile struct portregst              uint32t control         uint32t state         uint32t someotherreg      portregs  codepre  pThe register names are of course made up for the sake of example.  Im using a Microchip PIC32 device for anyone whos curious.p  pFrom my possibly incorrect understanding, marking a method codeconstcode means that the observable state of the object should not change as far as the caller is concerned.  So should the codeReadIOStatecode method emnotem be codeconstcode because it accesses codevolatilecode data that could change at any time and thus the caller would observe the change  Or should it be codeconstcode because the emmethodem isnt explicitly changing anythingp  pCurrently, I am leaning towards not making that method codeconstcode for the reason stated in the question.  This is especially true after stumbling upon a hrefhttpherbsutter.com20130524gotw6aconstcorrectnesspart13this GotW articlea, which states that the meaning of codeconstcode is changing to mean able to read concurrently.  My embedded application is singlethreaded, but I suppose that could be a good litmus test for codeconstcodeness in general.p  pAlso, how does the compiler treat codeconstcode methods  That is, what happens when I want to poll the state of the IO like thisp  precode wait for IO pin to go high whilemyIOpin.ReadIOState  codepre  pIf codeReadIOStatecode is codeconstcode, then can the compiler reuse the value returned after one call or is it smart enough to see that it is accessing codevolatilecode data and not do thatp

The headerData function works correctly, but when i add a string to the list elsewhere, it appends the entire list including the new string to the end of the list.p  pFor example, if i have the list 1,2,3 and i append 4 to it, then iterating through the list based on the pointer gives the result 1,2,3,1,2,3,4. I dont know a better way than using pointers to have multiple classes access the same data. Does anyone know how to fix the repeating listp  pExample Codep  precodefunction to save a new employee in memory bool EmployeeViewDialogsaveEmployeeEmployee e       employeesgtinsertegtname,e employeeNames ltlt egtname for int i  0 i lt employeeNamesgtlength i          qDebug ltlt employeeNamesgtati           QListltQStandardItemgt items     items ltlt new QStandardItemegtname     items ltlt new QStandardItemegtid     items ltlt new QStandardItemegtphone     items ltlt new QStandardItemegtemail     modelgtappendRowitems     return true  codepre  pThe append was just changed to the ltlt method. It is the employeeNames ltlt ename line. The for loop iterates through the list and does the same thing as what happens in the external class.p

Negative 1086 pI have a NodeWebkit based application, which does some heavy WebGL work enough to stress out a highend GPU, a fairly significant amount of JS processing, and Im sending codeOSCcode data on the order of 4kbs with the node codedgramcode module to an codescsynthcode child process to control audio.p  pThe OSC data is contained in one bundle every 10 frames of animation and the audio is fairly tolerant of some latency or irregularity in the messages it receives, but not on the scale Im experiencing.p  pUnfortunately I find that significantly often, there is a large delay between calling codesocket.send...code and the data actually being sent. It seems that under certain circumstances the scheduler places such a low priority on actually sending the data that each new packet becomes stalled almost indefinitely, before being suddenly released in large uncontrolled bursts that overflow the codescsynthcode command queue.p  pI cannot put the udp code into a WebWorker as codenode.jscode objects do not work in that context. Im considering attempting setting up a separate window and as such, process solely responsible for forwarding data received via codewindow.postMessagecode to UDP and viceversa, but since codepostMessagecode itself is also asynchronous, and the other window itself will probably have low priority if its not visible, I wonder if this is likely to provide much benefit.p  pIm pretty sure that the main problem lies in the scheduling of work in Javascript rather than anywhere else in the process I see no particular implication of trouble at the receiving end, although perhaps this could be assessed more closely.p  pHeres a brief snippet showing how the socket is setup and used including gathering some basic stats on the send callback.p  precodeudp  requiredgram.createSocketudp4 ... var udpStats  lastSendDelay 0, minSendDelayNumber.MAXVALUE, maxSendDelay1, meanSendDelayundefined var udpSend  functionbuf      var t  new Date     var wasSent  functiontimeOfRequest          return functionerr              if err sclogUDP send Error   err             var t2  new Date             var dt  t2  timeOfRequest             udpStats.lastSendDelay  dt             udpStats.minSendDelay  Math.mindt, udpStats.minSendDelay             udpStats.maxSendDelay  Math.maxdt, udpStats.maxSendDelay             udpStats.meanSendDelay  udpStats.meanSendDelay  undefined  dt  udpStats.meanSendDelaydt2                    udp.sendbuf, 0, buf.length, UDPPORT, localhost, wasSentt  codepre

Negative 1086 pI am developing an application that downloads some PDF documents from a government website. These documents almost always have attached pdfxml files that I need to extract. The application is in python and runs on linux. For extracting these documents however, I used to make a system call to pdftk to extract the files. Im now moving this application to Amazon EC2Amazon AMI. It turns out that the Amazon AMI does not support pdftk because of lack of support for gcjjre. Is there any alternative at all to extract attachments from a pdf file Either pure python or linux commandline PyPDF does not seem to have this. And I cant find any other ones either.p  pP.S.  I dont want to move off the Amazon AMI because I have already configured all the other stuff and its working fine.p  pP.P.S.  If there is any strong reason other than absence of pdftk to move off of Amazon AMI and onto say UbuntuCentOS, I would like to know. The application Im building might end up being pretty massive.p

Negative 1086 pIve been trying to wrap my head around a relatively simple problem, but doing for loops and a ton of comparing is really making my head spin.p  pHeres the problem Lets say I have an array of strings. Each string is a single word, parsed from one or several sentences. Ideally, Id want to create a new array that joins these single strings into multiword strings based on two facts words per line and the number of lines.p  pAs an example, lets say that I have 4 words and I set the words per line to 2, as well as the number of lines to 2, then it would display them like this briWord1 Word2i briWord3 Word4ip  pGranted there are special cases where there are only 3 words, which would divide the first 2 words on the first line and the last 1 on the second line. brbrbr How would you guys approach this type of problem, surely theres a simpler way of doing this, rather than only using mind numbing nested loops and ifelse sentencesp
Negative 1086 pI have a complex and mature scientific datacrunching project that consists of an entangled web of COM servers written mostly in VB6 that use only very little UI no forms nor controls, as most common users so far write short VBA programs with it.p  pWe have two future goalsp  ol lipstrongCreate a web UI by means of webserving component living on Linuxstrong. pli lipstrongGradually migrate the project to DPython and away from Windows and VB6strong.pli ol  pWe are at the stage of designing the messaging framework that would serve as best common nominator for both goals. p  pThe projects does heavy number crunching tasks, that involves running custom R scripts and LaTeXMS WordExcel reports. We need to expose some of the functionality to broad range of customers, and web UI seems the best option. On the other hand, as usage of Windows in our environment gradually declines, wed like to eventually port our project to Linux, or at least keep that option open and not lock ourselves in Windowsspecific technology. p  ul lipFrom this perspective, the natural .NETbased solution is something that we would like to avoid in the first place.pli lipDCOMMSRPC seems natural from VB6point of view, but this technology is depreciated and insecure. Besides, we would like to keep the webserving part of the project on Linux.pli lipSo the best option would be to write the webserving part on Linux using e.g. Python or D. The question remains how to efficiently do communication between VB6 and Python or D. It is obvious it will be some sort of network protocol. What we need, is efficient and easy to use protocol, that allows passing events and messages between two parties. The volume of data transferred will be small, and high latency not important. p  ul listrongDCOMMSRPCstrong seems fine to do local communication, but will it really be easy to do on the Linux part We have little experience with Python so far, and there is no support for it in D.li listrongCustom IP protocolstrong.

Is there a way to default having the UILabel start in the correct position p  pThe obvious work around is to set the initial position off the screen so it is hidden and then after a split second the UILabel moves to the correct place. but this seems to be the wrong way to accomplish what I need. below is the code.p  precodeproperty nonatomic, strong UILabel titleView codepre  p...p  precodeself.titleView  [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake20.0f, 0.0f, 150.0f, 128.0f] self.titleView.font  [UIFont systemFontOfSize10.0f] self.titleView.text  My title self.navigationItem.titleView  self.titleView codepre

Negative 1086 pI realize that the issue of the change event not firing for radio buttons on deselect is already widely discussed on this forum e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6736782whydoesjquerychangenotfireonradiobuttonsdeselectedasaresultofaherea. The standard approach seems to be to listen to the entire radio button group, which generally makes sense. p  pIn my case, however, I am building menu with Backbone consisting of an arbitrary number of views each of which is a radio button with the same name value e.g. codeltinput typeradio namefoogtcode. Each radio button is instantiated with a Backbone model and I want to bind a setter for one of that models attributes to fire whenever the radio button is selecteddeselected. My current solution is to build the event handlers in the parent view where each radio button is being instantiated but I would prefer not to do this because I dont want to hold on to external references to each radio button view. So the specific question is strongIs there any way to listen for an individual radio button deselect event without knowing anything about that buttons context.strong Thanks in advance for any replies. p

Negative 1086 pI wrote a script on a linux platform using the multiprocessing module of python.

Negative 1086 pIm been trying for many hours to get this working, just a basic long polling to a php script on the web server. I am testing it by having a text file which I check the last modified time of and compare it to the time the javascript sends a request. If the date of the file is newer then I send back a message update. When I load the page in my browser it sends the request and waits as expected which I can verify using Chrome dev tools but then when I edit the file ie. change the modified date the update.php script never echos the update message. Instead it just continues until it times out.p  pI think it might have something to do with caching because if I copy the URL that the JS requests into a separate tab it also doesnt respond but if I change the random parameter that jQuery attaches to prevent caching I get the desired update message back.

Although other structures for computing have been devised and implemented, the vast majority of computers in use today operate according to the von Neumann architecture.The von Neumann in von Neumann architecture refers to HungarianAmerican mathematician John von Neumann 19031957. Von Neumann was initially interested in access to the fastest computers available of which there were few during World War II in order to perform complex computations for a variety of warrelated problems. In 1944, Von Neumann became a consultant to the ENIAC Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer project, which upon its completion in 1945 became the worlds first general purpose, electronic computer. Even before ENIACs completion, von Neumann and several members of the team constructing ENIAC proposed building a more advanced computer, which would eventually become known as EDVAC Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer. In 1945 von Neumann wrote a landmark paper entitled The First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, which encapsulated his ideas concerning the fundamental structure that a computer should follow. That report, which Von Neumann originally intended to be seen by a limited group of associates, nevertheless became widely disseminated and had an immediate impact on computer development in the United States and abroad.Von Neumann followed up on his first report by producing two more papers coauthored with colleagues from the ENIAC team. What emerged from these three papers was an overall structure, or architecture, which is byandlarge followed to this day by the vast majority of electronic, digital computers. Von Neumann envisioned the structure of a computer system as being composed of the following components 1 the central arithmetic unit, which today is called the arithmeticlogic unit ALU. This unit performs the computers computational and logical functions 2 memory more specifically, the computers main, or fast, memory, such as random access memory RAM 3 a control unit that directs other components of the computer to perform certain actions, such as directing the fetching of data or instructions from memory to be processed by the ALU and 4 manmachine interfaces i.e., input and output devices, such as a keyboard for input and display monitor for output. Of course, computer technology has developed extensively since von Neumanns time. For instance, due to integrated circuitry and miniaturization the ALU and control unit have been integrated onto the same microprocessor chip, becoming an integrated part of the computers central processing unit CPU.The most noteworthy concept contained in von Neumanns first report was most likely that of the storedprogram principle. This principle holds that data, as well as the instructions used to manipulate that data, should be stored together in the same memory area of the computer. This idea deviated from the structure of previous computers. For example, ENIACs numeric data was stored in its vacuum tube memory, while the instructions that directed the processing of that data was provided by certain hardware settings. That is to say, before each new computation with ENIAC, an operator set various dials, connected and disconnected various electric plugs, and so forth. Those particular hardware settings represented ENIACs programming. It seemed obvious to von Neumann as it did to several other people working on the ENIAC project that to have a flexible, truly generalpurpose computer meant that the stored program principle should be implemented.One ramification of storing data and programming in the same general area of the computers main memory is the need to distinguish between the two. The contents of the typical computers main memory is seen by the computer as a series of zeroes and ones i.e., binary digits, or bits. The computer needs direction in order to determine whether a particular block of information is data or instructions. Von Neumanns control unit is the mechanism used to make the dataversusinstruction determination. When the control unit initiates a call for an instruction to be fetched for processing, a unit called the program counter points to the instructions location in memory i.e., its address in memory. The instruction is then fetched for execution by the processor. The address in memory of any data that is required is provided by the instruction itself. During this fetching and execution of an instruction, the program counter is incremented so that the next instruction can be found and executed. This process is sequential, meaning that instructions are executed in an ordered, sequential fashion, one instruction at a time. This serial execution of instructions is a hallmark of the von Neumann computer architecture. It is in contrast to parallel processing architectures in which multiple instructions are executed in tandem. A true parallel processing computer is considered a nonvon Neumann architecture machine.To summarize the main characteristics of the von Neumann architecture, it is noted that, first of all, such a computer is composed of distinct components, which are the ALU, control unit, inputoutput devices, and a single memory unit for storing both data and instructions i.e., the storedprogram principle. Secondly, instructions are carried out sequentially, one instruction at a time. As von Neumann himself recognized, the sequential execution of programming imposes a sort of speed limit on program execution since only one instruction at a time can be handled by the computers processor. Computer pioneer John Backus called this the von Neumann bottleneck. This bottleneck can manifest itself when the computers CPU processes at a rate faster than information can be delivered from main memory. There have been a plethora of techniques devised to make the most of the sequential nature that von Neumann architecture places on computers by reducing any information bottlenecks. The development of faster processors has meant that programs are executed more quickly. Processing speed has also been increased by modifying the memory side of the equation, as in the case of cache memory which basically provides a way of transferring information from main memory into a smaller, faster memory device. Other techniques include wider data buses to carry information more quickly between memory and the CPU reduction of wait states i.e., reduction of the time the CPU is required to suspend processing while waiting for information from auxiliary storage and many other speedenhancing strategies. It must be pointed out, however, that despite these advances and enhancements one is still left with the fundamental von Neumann architecture, which is followed in the overwhelming majority of computers in use today. codepre  pI need to count the unique wordsp  precodeprintlensetw.lower for w in openvonneumann.txt.read.split codepre  pand then create a dictionary in which the keys are the individual words found in the file and the values are the number of times each word appears in the text.p  pIm using Python 3.3.2.p

Negative 1086 pAn Apache Bench test revealed that high throughput on the database caused the following...p  ul liApache threads stuck in Sending Reply state, all related to a particular PHP file as seen in Apache extended status.li liMySQL sleeping connections with the same user as used by the PHP file.li ul  pNote Apache Bench was used from a remote location as a mechanism for stressing the database only, ie a script just connected to the DB and ran 5 queries per load.p  pRunning the same Apache Bench tests, but introducing a codemysqlclosecode at the end of the script solved the problem. What Id like to understand is why this happens.p  pA popular theory internally we have is thatp  ol liThe increased throughput on the database somehow prevented Apache from serving its requests properly. A buffer somewhere, either in MySQL or at the OS level got filled up.li liThe Apache requests therefore got stuck in a Sending Reply state, and because there was no codemysqlclosecode at the end of the PHP file a database connection remained open  probably only to expire once MySQLs connection timeout limit was reached and the MySQL connection was closed. strongTo be clear, we are not using codemysqlpconnectcodestrong, but we are using codemysqlconnectcode.li ol  pAs above, whilst weve solved the problem wed love to get to the bottom of this with a solid answer rather than an educated guess.p  pAnyone experienced this before and know of a solution Any tricksthoughtsmethods of identifying this.p

Negative 1086 pHeres my wish to create something abstract in WPF. Youve got a main window called main for example, even if its not correct we dont care with two buttons. Those two buttons have the same function  they open a new window, the same for both of them, but with different things inside. So I decided to create an abstract class to rule them like that p  precodepublic abstract partial  class A  Window      public A              InitializeComponent  Not sure about that, its kinda weird to use it here no            ...   public partial class B  A      public B              InitializeComponent  Since its already in A I shouldnt have to use it here right            ...   public partial class C  A      public C              InitializeComponent  Same thing here...           ...  codepre  pDebugging gives me something like  error CS0263 Partial declarations of namespace.B must not specify different base classes.p  pRemoving partial from A class gives  error CS0260 Missing partial modifier on declaration of type namespace.A another partial declaration of this type exists.p  pI know that partial specifies if a class has another part of her somewhere else like the xaml file beside the cs one, so I guess the abstract class has to be partial too since it contains my controls. Maybe the B class shouldnt be partial p  pI know memories it works with Windows Forms, but theres no xaml files so its easier, and I didnt find any useful tips. I think I understood that this problem occurs when I dont change something in my xaml file, which doesnt works as simply as class  abstract class. Maybe the subclass thing p  pPlease note that Im a beginner in WPF apps, so I thank you in advance if your answer is as detailed as possible.p  pThanks p

Negative 1086 pI am trying to use the Observatory tab in dartium dev tools, to find a memory leak in my framework. I have made a test program a hrefhttp0xor1.netpuritymemoryprofiletest relnofollowherea which should be viewable in js or dart. My goal is to find out where references are holding on to codeMassivecode objects, which are just wrappers around a codeListltdoublegtcode with a million codedoublecodes in it. If I click codeNew Clientcode I get a new client view on the right, if I generate a bunch of codeMassivecode objects and refresh the observatory tools I see that codedoublecode now takes up most of the app memory usage. If I then delete the codeMassivecode objects and wait 5 seconds for the frameworks remote garbage collection to run, then refresh the observatory tab, the codedoublecodes still occupy the same amount of memory even though they should have been GCd I click the GC button on the observatoy tab to, I assume, force the GC to run. If I keep creating and deleting codeMassivecode objects in the app eventually the page crashes, typically after around 28 codeMassivecode objects have been created. My problem is finding out how to use the tools to find out where the codeMassivecode objects are still having references hold on to them. Is it possible to get find references to objects in the dev toolsp  pUPDATEp  pI have fixed the memory leak in the test app I link too and describe above, therefore following the instructions above will not result in recreating the memory leak.p

I have my ajax. Here is the codep  precode .ajax  success  functiondata  fpcont.htmldata     , codepre  pBasically my success happens using ajax and I data gets processed using php. The data success is suppose to be loaded by id but that never happends. Since the codeanchorClickcode is disrupting the data location path and what happends is that the page refreshes with the location of the index page. My question is how can I stop my anchorClick and load my ajax properlyp
Negative 1086 pI am writing a program that will output 3D model files based on simple geometric shapes e. g. rectangular prisms amp cylinders with known coordinates in 3dimensional space. As an example, imagine creating a 3D model of stonehenge. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8866914fileformatforgenerating3dmodelsfromscratchthis questiona suggests that OBJ files are the easiest to generate, but Im struggling to find a good tutorial or easytouse library for doing so. p  pCan anyone eitherp  p1 describe stepbystep how to create a simple file OR 2 point me to a tutorial that describes how to do sop  pNotes  Using a GUIbased program to draw such files is not an option for me  I have no prior experience with 3D modeling  Other formats such as WRL or DAE would work for me as wellp  pEDITp  pI do not need to use textures, just combinations of simple geometric shapes positioned in 3D space.p

Negative 1086 pI am developing a simple C application that does some networking. I need it to send UDP packets to another application over the Internet, but in order to prevent any congestion I need to tune the send rate at a specific speed. Therefore, I need my program to sleep between two consecutive packet being sent. usleep function looked like a good choice, but for reasonably fast connections I get to sleep for very short amounts of time, in the order of microseconds. It actually works reasonably well even for these rates, but I noticed that it comes at a huge cost in terms of CPU. As an example, I tried to do just thisp  precodewhiletrue usleep100 codepre  pThis just loops on a sleep command, each of 100 microseconds, right Now, the CPU speed is in the order of the GHz, so 100 microseconds means a sleep time 5 orders of magnitude bigger than the clock speed. But just this burns 10 of my CPU usage.p  pSo what Am I doing something wrong I worked around this by setting wider intervals and sending packets in small series, but nonetheless I would like to know if there are reasonably efficient alternatives to usleep for sleeping for small amounts of time.p  pThank you very muchp

But when I run it on a build that Ant has produced it will build successfully but I get the following error when I try and access the functionality.p  precodeEAndroidRuntime 4219 java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError Couldnt load opentok from loader dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[DexPathList[[zip file dataappcom.sps.smc.SMC1.apk],nativeLibraryDirectories[dataapplibcom.sps.smc.SMC1, vendorlib, systemlib]]] findLibrary returned null EAndroidRuntime 4219        at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibraryRuntime.java358 EAndroidRuntime 4219        at java.lang.System.loadLibrarySystem.java526 EAndroidRuntime 4219        at com.opentok.android.Session.ltclinitgtSession.java51 codepre  pI am assuming this might have something to do with the .jar and .so using native functionality which Ant is having some trouble dealing with.p  pIve tried putting the .jar and .so into the applications that end up using the library but that doesnt seem to work either.p  pAny ideasp

After selecting, it prints a correct file path to the console e.g., codeDownloadsfoo.txtcode. But at this point, codefs.appendFilecode cant find that location. So, I thought, maybe it needs the path from root. So I manually passed it  codehomechronosuserDownloadsfoo.txtcode and codefs.appendFilecode still couldnt find the file.p  pSo, this entire post was a long winded way of asking how nodes fsmodule handles paths, and where the root directory is located when I use browserify.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1086 pIve been reading up on the Java Sound API for the last few weeks and I still cant figure out if this is possible. I ask because I want to write a program that takes sound data passing through the system headed for an output line, like my computers speakers or headphone jack, and writes that data to an audio file. p  pFrom what I have read so far about codejavax.sound.sampledcode, it seems like I can only read in data from a codeMixercode via a codeTargetDataLinecode however, after writing a test program strongprovided belowstrong to query my system for available mixers and then query those mixers for available target and source data lines I realized all my output mixers except for my default mixer only supported codeSourceDataLinecodes. Furthermore, I cant tell whether the codeTargetDataLinecode from my computers default mixer I have a Macbook pro, can read audio data sent to the mixer from other applications.

Negative 1086 pGood dayp  pI have 2 Projects in my Eclipse. MainActivity1 and MainActivity2 are the names of the activities. The MainActivity2 is connected to the MainActivity1 via Project in the properties of the MainActivity1. So far, I can call the package of the MainActivity2 from the MainActivity1. Now, below are my problemp  pI have a button in MainActivity1. What I want to do is after I click on the button in the MainActivity1, it runs the MainActivity2 project and some variables will be passed on to the MainActivity2.p  pIve been searching in google for a while now and I couldnt get the right keyword for it. Ive checked some of the questions here in StackOverflow but Im unable to locate the problem similar to mine with calling and running the MainActivity2 class from the MainActivity1.javap  pIm a noob in Android Java but have knowledge in other OOP.p  pAny tips will be a great help. Thanksp
Negative 1086 pIve been having a strange problem that I cant get around. Whenever I try to render PDF from jrxml on application server on CentOS machine, I receive java.io.IOException Problem reading font data. Reports are generated using Jaspersoft Studio 5.6.0.

However, now I want to include export links along with the link to the onpage table and to get everything aligned I want to drop it into a table, but Im not sure how to do this.  To have each row in the same table requires having multiple codengrepeatcode iterators on what are essentially dummy elements, but I dont know that I can do that and generate valid markup inside of a codelttablegtcode.p  pIdeally, Id be able to do something like...p  precodelttr ngrepeatdist, style, gender, finishers in genders in styles in race.resultsgt   lttdgtlta hrefdiststylegenderresultsgtdist style genderltagtlttrgt   lttdgtlta href classdownloadgtCSVltagtlttdgt lttrgt codepre  pAngularJS requiring that all of its logic be attached to DOM elements means it requires generating unnecessary markup.  I saw one reference to creating a directive, which looked pretty foreign to me.  Im not opposed to learning the ins and outs of AngularJS, but this strikes me as something that ought to be straightforward.  In a templating system like Twig this would be a snap, but I feel like Im going to have to jump through a lot of hoops to accomplish this with AngularJS.p  pIs there a straightforward way to do this that doesnt involve all of the logic being inside of my controller  If the directive approach is the only option, so be it, but I would consider this a huge mark against AngularJS and my interest in pursuing it.p

If i add a new server while others are running. Those servers wont ping the new server.p  pNow I have another question. In production, having a lot of Mongodb docker image running on a same physical server is possible but its not safe   if my physical server falls down, i lose all my Mongodb replicas and my service is down  if my physical server uses internal storage, all my docker images use the same disk... and Im going to have IO problems.p  pSo my question is  strongHow can I deploy many mongodb replicas on multiple physical servers  How those mongodb replicas can communicate with each others primary and secondaries servers can change while they are on different servers or even on different datacenters strong p

When user click on one link before it completes the process backside and loads the page, he is hitting another links without wait which causing issue. Im looking for the solution to avoid user to hit multiple clicks at a time. p  pTo solve, I have found the Jquery BlockUI plugin and downloaded the production version of jquery.blockUi.min.js from the link a hrefhttpsgithub.commalsupblockuiand relnofollowhttpsgithub.commalsupblockuianda added below code snippetp  precodelinkX.clickfunction   .blockUI message lth1gtltimg srcbusy.gif gt Just a moment...lth1gt    codepre  pNow when I click on any link all the links have same class name immediately this code blocks the page and display popup with message just a moment, and then once the java processrequest default submit which is form actionxxx finishes it does process some action and update the database too the page refresh and then automatically the page unblocks.

In these cases, a link is provided so the user can click and see those details.p  pThe link is correctly built when it has to be shown, but since those details can be very large, those should be shown in another tab in the browser, not in the same one showing the listing. So, the new page will show data from a strongsingle studentstrong.p  pBecause codeStudentListBeancode does not expose a single student, it cannot be used to show data from a single student. Changing its behavior is considered a bad choice because the bean intends to manage a collection of students, not a single one.

Negative 1086 pI have spent some time working with the AjaxFileUpload control and I am having a great deal of difficulty utilizing it. The issue I am having is that I have set the max number of files that can be selected for the upload Que. Once I click upload, the process works great and the files are stored. However, I can go back and upload additional files. This is an issue because I only want the user to be able to select up to 3 files for the upload Que and for the control to only upload 3 files. Is there a way that I can disable the Select and Upload button once the max number of files is reached If so, is there a way that I can clear the files uploaded from the control if the user wants reupload to the controlp  pI have found limited information on this topic on the web.

Negative 1086 pI have decided to migrate an application in the architecture JPAEJBJSF toward JPASpringJSF.p  pDuring this migration to spring I have enabled CDI also. After the migration of all the layers I am at the level of the layer of the controllers. In Java EE I have annotated methods with codePostConstructcode which allow me to initialize variables,test configurations for the applied.These methods are running before before the settersgetters.p  pExample Java EE codep  precodeManagedBeannameclassecontroller SessionScoped public class ClasseController implements Serializable       private Etablissements etablissement     private Classe classe  new Classe     private Niveau niveau  new Niveau     private Personne currentUser      public ClasseController       PostConstruct     void initialiseSession          etablissement  new Etablissements          Etablissements testEtab  null         testEtab  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getSessionMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF         if testEtab  null              etablissement  testEtab          else              etablissement  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getApplicationMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF                    setter getters  codepre  pAfter migration on Spring I have read that the codePostConstructcode is only executed after the initialization of the beans in the context.Therefore I have found that my methods that should be executed at the start of my application no longer run during the opening of a web page using my controller.p  pI would like to know how I can implement this without too many changes to the codep  phere is the code Springp  precodeNamedclassecontroller SessionScoped public class ClasseController implements Serializable       private Etablissements etablissement     private Classe classe  new Classe     private Niveau niveau  new Niveau     private Personne currentUser      public ClasseController       PostConstruct     void initialiseSession          etablissement  new Etablissements          Etablissements testEtab  null         testEtab  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getSessionMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF         if testEtab  null              etablissement  testEtab          else              etablissement  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getApplicationMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF                setter getters  codepre  pThanksp

Negative 1086 pI have a remote form in my Rails 4 application for my codeArtistscode model. I have another form for my codeShowscode, and the codeShowscode form has a link that can be clicked if the user wishes to add a new codeArtistcode to the database from inside the codeShowscode form. Clicking that link sends a codeGETcode request to codeartistsnewcode and the codeArtistsControllercode assigns codeartistcode a new codeArtistcode and then renders codenew.js.erbcode, which hides the link to add a new codeArtistcode and renders the form for a new codeArtistcode in its place.p  pThe form is rendered fine, and when I click submit a codePOSTcode request is sent and it is routed to the codecreatecode method in my codeArtistsControllercode The server then sends a response back that is in my codecreate.js.erbcode file, but that response is interpreted by the browser as html.

Negative 1086 pIm building something like an archiving system, which will be used to annotate and catalog already scanned documents.  It is a ClientServer system, with multiple clients. p  pThe main workflow will be something like thisp  pThe client will send the file to the server coupled with annotations. The server should save the file on its file system and the annotations along with the file path on a SQL Server database.p  pWhen the client requests a record of a certain file, the server should serve that file along with the saved annotations back to the client. In addition, there will be some SearchEditing operations as well.p  pIts the first time I handle something like this and I am having a hard time designing it The options I have so far arep  p1 Connect the client directly to SQL Server for the data and use Sockets to   transfer files between the client and the server I mean the actual Server Machine directly. p  p2 Use WCF, for both data and file transfer. p  p3 Build my own custom Middleware Server Application that will handle passing data back and forth between the client and SQL Server and handle file transfer as well.

Negative 1086 pI am fairly new to NoSQL databases and I usually dont have an issue, but in my latest mobile app I am trying to use Amazons DynamoDB and I have hit a wall. p  pGenerally, I have no issues if the table contains unique, single entries.  However, if the table contains a list of items associated with a specific attribute, I am not sure how to retrievequery the data properly.  p  pFor example, below is a table.  We will call it IAWSDDBSESSIONSI.  It contains all the information about the user sessions where SessionID is the hash keyp  pAssume that the table data is represented as follows  iSessionIDhash, StartTime, StopTime, UserEmailip  pre      TableName  AWSDDBSESSIONS     AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com     BBBLWL102, 122000.000Z, 182000.000Z, jane.smithmydomain.com     CCCUFE103, 030000.000Z, 033000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com  pre  pbr I can easily get a single entry if I specify the hash key valueSessionID.  For example, if I wanted the first item in the listAAADFR101, I would just make a getItem request with the specified SessionID  p  pre Amazons Java SDK PseudoCode   AmazonSDK.API.Table.getItemAAADFR101  The SQL equilavent is     select  from AWSDDBSESSIONS where SessionIDAAADFR101   Expected Results   AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z, john.doemydomain.compre  pbr However, if I want to get all the sessions that are associated with john.doemydomain.com, I have no idea what to do.  p  pre      Amazons Java SDK PseudoCode        Create a Condition...       Condition userEmailCondition  new Condition                 .withComparisonOperatorComparisonOperator.EQ.toString                 .withAttributeValueListnew AttributeValue.withSjohn.doemydomain.com          Create the Map of Conditions...

The SQL equilavent is       select  from AWSDDBSESSIONS where UserIDjohn.doemydomain.com      Expected Results       AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com       CCCUFE103, 030000.000Z, 033000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com  pre  pAs mentioned above, the Java pseudo code doesnt work because Amazons DynamoDB API requires that primary key SessionID when you perform a query.  Even if you changed the DynamoDB tables schema to use a hash key SessionID and a range UserEmail, it does you no good.  Essentially, you run into the same problem.p  pI tried to come up with some alternative solutions, but I seem to come back to the same problem no matter how I approach it.p  pbr BR BAlternative 1B The first alternative that I thought of, was to add another attribute which was a unique identifier.  So you would change the schemap  pre      Original Schema         SessionIDhash, StartTime, StopTime, UserEmail      New Table Schema       RecordIDhash, SessionID, StartTime, StopTime, UserEmail  pre  pThis creates a table similar to one that you would use in a Relational Database RDB.  However, it suffers from the original problem of not being able to query on UserEmail.p  pbr BAlternative 2B After some online research, it was stated that you could split the table up into smaller tables based on various attributes userEmail.  So for every user you could create a table to store their session info in.  Hence, our original sample would be split into tables with the following datap  pre      TableName  AWSDDBSESSIONSjane.smithmydomain.com     BBBLWL102, 122000.000Z, 182000.000Z       TableName  AWSDDBSESSIONSjohn.doemydomain.com     AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z     CCCUFE103, 030000.000Z, 033000.000Z  pre  pIn some cases this approach is recommended because it would nudge you in the direction of removing the redundant data UserEmail and it may lower your costs because it scans less data while querying the tables.  But it seems to create a scalability issue.  If you have 5 people using your app, then you would only have 5 tables to worry about.  However, if your user base grows to 1000, 100K, or 1 Million, then you would have a crazy amount of tables to keep track of.  So I am not sure if this is the best approach.p  pBR BAlternative 3B I tried to add some indexes for the attributes that I thought were important, but it didnt work as I had thought and still had the same original problem. p  pbr BAlternative 4B Change the hash key from the SessionID, to the UserEmail, and then use the SessionID as the range key.  But it seems that this may not work under certain circumstances such as when these values overlap, have different attribute fields, or if the attributes have the same value.  For example, if John Doe had another Session with ID of AAADFR101 then it would overwrite the existing entry instead of having 2 entries with similar information.  You can overcome this challenge by adding a new attribute RecordID and use that as the primary key hash value.  However, you are back to the original problem would you try to query.p  pbr Ugh... My head is starting to hurt.  Can someone point me in the right direction.  p  pThanks in advance,p  pRandyp

Negative 1086 pCurrently, I am at a design halt for a mobile application I am working on. The issue I am having is determining the best route in connecting my mobile application with a database. p  pI am using a digital ocean server to host my content. At this point, I am using mongoDB to store my data. The app has to allow users to upload media to mongoDB. Additionally, the app has to be able to retrieve media from mongoDB and display the media in the app. p  pThrough research, I have learned that connecting the app directly to mongoDB is bad practice for obvious reasons. The alternative approach I have learned, is to make your own API to handle the requests. This is where I am really at a stand still. p  pI plan on using node.js to write my APIwhich I am still really trying to get a grasp on. What I do not understand is how this API and the java code for the Android app interact. How am I to post data from the android app through an API to my database Conversely, how am I to get data from my database through an API to my app p  pAny help, suggestions, recommended reading, etc. in this matter is much appreciated.  p

Negative 1086 pFor those unfamiliar with how forums work, each forum displays a list of threads rows sorted by a unique id thread id.

My problem is when I query this information I query it according to the posts the loggedin user has made in that thread, and if they have made multiple, then multiple posts are retrieved which then causes the last post to be the one used to define the information shown on the thread listing.

Negative 1086 pstrongNot a duplicatestrong because the issue described here happens despite having deleted the .exd files as suggested in the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28074908excelrenamingactivexcontrolsonothercomputersExcel renaming Activex Controls on other computersa and elsewhere.p  hr  pOne particular machine on our network lets call it Computer 2 spuriously and silently changes the code name of ActiveX command buttons placed in Excel workbooks. Whatever the Name property of a button was before, it returns it to the default codeCommandButtoncode scheme. codeCommandButton1code, codeCommandButton2code... etc. p  pWitness the screenshots below. The code name of codebtn2code changes to codeCommandButton1code when opened on Computer 2. p  pWhy How do I fix thisp  pI can even have the exact same workbook opened from the same Book1.xlsm file on a network drive simultaneously on both machines one of them readonly, obviously. Looking at both screens at the same time, the button names are different Computer 2 changed it. p  pThis, of course, breaks the functionality of the buttons, because they no longer trigger their intended event code. In the example below, codebtn2code used to call codePrivate Sub btn2Clickcode from the sheet module and execute the code in that Sub. But on Computer 2, the button is no longer named codebtn2code, so it doesnt trigger that event it does nothing  or worse, if there happened to be a button called CommandButton1 before, it triggers that unrelated event. p  pWorkbook opened on Computer 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDAolX.png altenter image description herep  pExact same workbook, but this time on Computer 2p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compeUHx.png altenter image description herep  pNow, this has happened to me before. Once or twice over the years, on a couple different machines, all my commandbuttons got renamed like that. But Ive never been able to reproduce this, and I thought, corrupted workbook, no big deal. p  pBut this happens consistently on Computer 2, every single time. p  pNonActiveX, Form Control buttons, such as Form Button 1 in the example above, are unaffected by this issue.

Negative 1086 pI have two containers a 2dimensional NxN matrix and a 1dimensional array which is the transposed 1D version of the matrix so for a 5x5 array, I will have a 25 element array with the same values.

Negative 1086 pI have an application running on two machines, each of them are have established a connection through GCM via TCPXMPP.p  pOne issue im experiencing is that sending an xmpp message through one connection with the deliveryreceiptrequested flag, does not necessarily means receiving the receipt for that message on the same connection. This is obviously very problematic, since connections might be set up on different processes, sometimes on different machines.p  pAn other issue is that machine received deliveryreceipt which does not send original message tries to send a codedelivery receipt ackcode to the GCM, GCM closes this connection.p  pDoes it seem to be  weird GCM send delivery receipt an other machines and  when it receives the codedelivery receipt ackcode from that machine it closes the connection since message does not send from that machinep

Negative 1086 pI typically use the atom editor for any coding work and have folders on my computer with the code. After doing some updates on my Mac OS computer, some ruby gems stopped worked, rvm no longer responded and homebrew gave me a ton of trouble. I want to prevent this from happening again and figured Id use Vagrant instead. I like it so far and it works fine, however I want to use my Atom editor nevertheless. p  pNormally I work on projects using gulp or grunt and they compile the files whenever any changes are made. While I have managed to connect to Vagrant with FileZilla, I have no idea how to connect atom to it. All I need is to edit the files in the Vagrant VM, as I would if they were stored in regular directories on my Mac. Any idea how to solve thisp

Negative 1086 pI have a huge CSV file 90 GB from which I need to extract some columns and then change the strings into integers and store it in a new CSV. So, I wrote the code and tested it on a small sample CSV of about 100,000 rows. It worked fine, so I proceeded to feed the original CSV into the program. I knew it would take overnight to complete, so I come back in the morning and find that the program has not finished, and the processed file is only about 1 GB in size till then which was really small, I expected it to be at least 10 GB by the time it completed, allowing for the fact that integers take less space then strings, and also that I was extracting only 10 out of 50 columns from the original CSV.p  pSo, I modify the code to only do the extraction and processing separately. I found that, without the processing, only the extraction completes in 1011 hours resulting in a CSV 38 GB in size. So then I proceed to do the processing of the extracted CSV,and it has still not finished after 18 hours of running it now, and the resulting CSV is, as of now, only about 1.5 GB in size.p  pWhat could be the reason for this My code for processing is thisp  precoderequire rubygems require mechanize require csv require time      CSV.openFormattedColumns.csv, wb do csv     csv ltlt [time, articlecategoryid, articleID, datewday, datetime, lat, lon, platform, push, udid]     CSV.foreachExtractedColumns.csv, headersgttrue do row          timeTime.parserow[0].toi          articlecategoryidrow[1].toi          articleIDrow[2].toi          if row[3]sunday             weekday7         elsif row[3]saturday             weekday6         elsif row[3]friday             weekday5         elsif row[3]thursday             weekday4         elsif row[3]wednesday             weekday3         elsif row[3]tuesday             weekday2         elsif row[3]monday             weekday1         end               datetime  row[4].toi          lat  row[5].tof          lon  row[6].tof          if row[7]Android             platform2         elsif row[7]iPhone             platform1         end           if row[8]Y             push1         elsif row[8]N             push0         end      unless udids.includerow[9]       udids ltlt row[9]     end     udid  udids.indexrow[9]  1      array  [time, articlecategoryid, articleID, weekday, datetime, lat, lon, platform, push, udid]     csvltltarray   end end codepre  pAs far as I can see, its a simple program, and with the smaller sample program of 100,000 rows, when I tried the extraction and processing separately, they both finished in about the same time 12 mins.p
