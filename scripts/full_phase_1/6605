Positive 6605 pI have a windows azure web role web api cloud service that until now had endpoints 80 and 443 exposed to the external load balancer. I have a team city configuration that builds the project and deploys the produced package to the staging environment of a specific cloud service. I then use the staging environment to warmup and test the deployment and if everything is ok I swap the cloud service environments with no downtime. A typical azure cloud service deployment scenario.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve now is hide the two endpoints of the web api from the internet, using an internal load balancer, and expose them using a reverse proxy nginx that will run in a separate cloud service that will expose ports 80 and 443. Problem is that if in my configuration I define that the endpoints will be internally load balanced like sop  precodeltEndpointsgt    ltInputEndpoint nameHttpIn protocolhttp port80 loadBalancerapiILB gt  ltEndpointsgt codepre  pand p  precodeltLoadBalancersgt   ltLoadBalancer nameapiILBgt      ltFrontendIPConfiguration typeprivate subnetSubnet1 staticVirtualNetworkIPAddress10.0.1.111 gt   ltLoadBalancergt  ltLoadBalancersgt codepre  pI can only deploy this once as it creates an internal load balancer that holds the assigned ip. Thus my whole workflow of using staging to test, warmup and swap will not work anymore. So if I deploy this to cloudservice1 production environment and then try to deploy a latter version on the staging environment I get an error that the ILB ip is taken very reasonable and cannot deploy. p  pstrongWorkaround 1strong Do not assign a static ip to the load balancer and let it get the next available one.p  pstrongProblemstrong p  pI am not sure if it would work if I did not assign the ip statically but it wouldnt help as I would need to have a static ip to assign to the nginx reverse proxy to forward requests to.p  pstrongWorkaround 2strong Upgrade the deployment in place thus overwriting the previous deploymentp  pstrongProblemstrongp  pUpgrading the deployment in place will have the known disadvantages like not being able to warm up before going live, something might go wrong and there is no undo etc, so it is not an option. p  pstrongWorkaround 3strong Change the static IP per deployment by altering csfcg files during the teamcity build process.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pChanging the static IP per deployment also sounds like a complicated process that will be hidden inside teamcity configurations and will need the nginx proxy configuration to be updated by hand after every new deployment.p  pI am thinking that the scenario I am trying to accomplish is very common and there should be a concise way of continuous deploying using a reverse proxy and internally load balanced cloud services, but I cannot find any documentationexamples on this.p

Positive 6605 pIm trying to configure nginx for a parametrized URL of the formp  pa hrefhttpexample.commydir123456789abcdef0000 relnofollowhttpexample.commydir123456789abcdef0000ap  pWhere mydir exists on the filesystem wwwnodepublicmydir, and the number is an identifier used by some javascript on the page. Ideally it would support other parameters like a hrefhttpexample.commydir123456789abcdef0000parm1value1param2value2 relnofollowhttpexample.commydir123456789abcdef0000parm1value1param2value2a. Note Im not trying to rewrite querystring parameters, the javascript on the page is parsing out the URL, so this should be pretty straightforward as far as configuring the server to just serve everything from wwwnodepublicmydir.p  pMy regex is working for aliasing the hex parameter alone, and serving up the index page from mydir. The problems arise when there is any slash in the URL following the ID.p  pIm pretty sure Im approaching this wrong altogether, but here is what I have so farp  precodelocation mydir      index    page.html  location  mydirb[af09]20,30      defaulttype    texthtml     alias    wwwnodepublicmydirpage.html  codepre  pFirst off, Im pretty sure sticking the html page on the alias is bad, which probably shows you how clueless I am on configuring nginx.... But it works, sortof. The reason for that was a standard ailas path no html page would cause nginx to automatically append a trailing slash, giving a 403 Forbidden error.p  pAs configured, when I stick a trailing slash in there, I get a 500 error and this in the logs  wwwnodepublicmydirpage.htmlindex.html is not a directory, client 174.68.88.79, server example.com, request GET mydir56047f7b02e62c8709961136 HTTP1.1, host example.comp  pAnd when I put slashes in after the ID, but not at the end, it tries to serve up the nonexistent path created by those slashes.p  pSo basically what I want to do is this starting at a hrefhttpexample.commydir relnofollowhttpexample.commydira, have everything served up from wwwnodepublicmydir regardless of what the remaining URL looks like.p  pThanksp

Negative 6605 pThis one is a bit tedious in as far as explaining, so here goes. Im essentially populating a tableView on the iPhone with multiple sections, and potentially multiple rows per section. To my understanding, its best to have an array of arrays so that you can simply determine how many sections one has by sending a message to the top level array of count, then for rows per section, doing the same for the inner arrays.  My data is in the form of a dictionary. One of the keyvalue pairs in the dictionary determines where it will be displayed on the tableView.  An example is the followingp  precode   name bob,   location 3      name jane,   location 50     name chris,   location 3  codepre  pIn this case Id have an array with two subarrays. The first subarray would have two dictionaries containing bob and chris since theyre both part of location 3. The second subarray would contain jane, since she is in location 50. Whats my best bet in Cocoa populate this data structure A hash table in C would probably do the trick, but Id rather use the classes available in Cocoa.p  pThanks and please let me know if I need to further clarify.p

Negative 6605 pIm porting a process which creates a MASSIVE codeCROSS JOINcode of two tables.  The resulting table contains 15m records looks like the process makes a 30m cross join with a 2600 row table and a 12000 row table and then does some grouping which must split it in half.  The rows are relatively narrow  just 6 columns.  Its been running for 5 hours with no sign of completion.  I only just noticed the count discrepancy between the known good and what I would expect for the cross join, so my output doesnt have the grouping or deduping which will halve the final table  but this still seems like its not going to complete any time soon.p  pFirst Im going to look to eliminate this table from the process if at all possible  obviously it could be replaced by joining to both tables individually, but right now I do not have visibility into everywhere else it is used.p  pBut given that the existing process does it in less time, on a less powerful machine, using the FOCUS language, are there any options for improving the performance of large codeCROSS JOINcodes in SQL Server 2005 hardware is not really an option, this box is a 64bit 8way with 32GB of RAMp  pDetailsp  pIts written this way in FOCUS Im trying to produce the same output, which is a CROSS JOIN in SQLp  precodeJOIN CLEAR  DEFINE FILE COSTCENT   WBLANKA1      END TABLE FILE COSTCENT   BY WBLANK BY CCCOSTCENT   ON TABLE HOLD AS TEMPCC FORMAT FOCUS   END  DEFINE FILE JOINGLAC   WBLANKA1      END TABLE FILE JOINGLAC   BY WBLANK BY ACCOUNTNO BY LILNTM   ON TABLE HOLD AS TEMPAC FORMAT FOCUS INDEX WBLANK  JOIN CLEAR  JOIN WBLANK IN TEMPCC TO ALL WBLANK IN TEMPAC DEFINE FILE TEMPCC   CAJCCACA16EDITCCCOSTCENTEDITACCOUNTNO   END TABLE FILE TEMPCC   BY CAJCCAC BY CCCOSTCENT AS COST CENTER BY ACCOUNTNO   BY LILNTM   ON TABLE HOLD AS TEMPCCAC   END codepre  pSo the required output really is a CROSS JOIN its joining a blank column from each side.p  pIn SQLp  precodeCREATE TABLE [COSTCENT]        [COSTCTRNUM] [int] NOT NULL,        [CCCNM] [varchar]40 NULL,        [CCDEPT] [varchar]7 NULL,        [CCALSRC] [varchar]6 NULL,        [CCHIERCODE] [varchar]20 NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKLOOKUPGLCOSTCTR] PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED         [ID] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY]  CREATE TABLE [JOINGLAC]        [ACCOUNTNO] [int] NULL,        [LILNTM] [int] NULL,        [PRPRODUCT] [varchar]5 NULL,        [PRGROUP] [varchar]1 NULL,        [ACNAMELONG] [varchar]40 NULL,        [LINMLONG] [varchar]30 NULL,        [LIINC] [int] NULL,        [LIMULT] [int] NULL,        [LIANLZ] [int] NULL,        [LITYPE] [varchar]2 NULL,        [PRSORT] [varchar]2 NULL,        [PRNM] [varchar]26 NULL,        [PZSORT] [varchar]2 NULL,        [PZNAME] [varchar]26 NULL,        [WANLZ] [varchar]3 NULL,        [OPMLNTM] [int] NULL,        [PSGROUP] [varchar]5 NULL,        [PSSORT] [varchar]2 NULL,        [PSNAME] [varchar]26 NULL,        [PTGROUP] [varchar]5 NULL,        [PTSORT] [varchar]2 NULL,        [PTNAME] [varchar]26 NULL  ON [PRIMARY]  CREATE TABLE [JOINCCAC]        [CAJCCAC] [varchar]16 NOT NULL,        [CACOSTCENT] [int] NOT NULL,        [CAGLACCOUNT] [int] NOT NULL,        [CALNTM] [int] NOT NULL,        [CAUNIT] [varchar]6 NOT NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKJOINCCACKNOWNGOOD] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED         [CAJCCAC] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pWith the SQL Codep  precodeINSERT  INTO [JOINCCAC]                 [CAJCCAC]        ,[CACOSTCENT]        ,[CAGLACCOUNT]        ,[CALNTM]        ,[CAUNIT]                SELECT  Util.PADLEFTCONVERTvarchar, CC.COSTCTRNUM, 0,                                      7                 Util.PADLEFTCONVERTvarchar, GL.ACCOUNTNO, 0,                                        9 AS CCJCCAC               ,CC.COSTCTRNUM AS CACOSTCENT               ,GL.ACCOUNTNO  900000000 AS CAGLACCOUNT               ,GL.LILNTM AS CALNTM               ,udfBUPDEFGL.ACCOUNTNO, CC.COSTCTRNUM, GL.LILNTM, N AS CAUNIT        FROM   JOINGLAC AS GL        CROSS JOIN COSTCENT AS CC codepre  pDepending on how this table is subsequently used, it should be able to be eliminated from the process, by simply joining to both the original tables used to build it.  However, this is an extremely large porting effort, and I might not find the usage of the table for some time, so I was wondering if there were any tricks to codeCROSS JOINcodeing big tables like that in a timely fashion especially given that the existing process in FOCUS is able to do it more speedily.  That way I could validate the correctness of my building of the replacement query and then later factor it out with views or whatever.p  pI am also considering factoring out the UDFs and string manipulation and performing the CROSS JOIN first to break the process up a bit.p  pstrongRESULTS SO FARstrongp  pIt turns out that the UDFs do contribute a lot negatively to the performance.  But there also appears to be a big difference between a 15m row cross join and a 30m row cross join.  I do not have SHOWPLAN rights boo hoo, so I cant tell whether the plan it is using is better or worse after changing indexes.  I have not refactored it yet, but am expecting the entire table to go away shortly.p
Negative 6605 pI am likely to be working on a few projects soon where I will need to take data from a file and input that data programmatically into another thirdparty not my own application. One problem I have no idea how to do this.I will need to enter data like times on a time sheet, for exampls  Can anyone steer me in the right direction to acquire this skillp  pADDITIONAL SPECS  I wrote the original post late at night so may not have been as detailed as I should have.  Here is an example  My client has an ERP app that they use to collect time stamps from the line workers as they perform their jobs and get projects out the door throughout the day.  This app does NOT have an API I can use to feed data into.  I have heard of a guy who was able to actually push data onto the screen in this apps windows and controls programmatically, such that the data was able to be collected into, say, an Excel worksheet, then effectively uploaded into this app.  Sort of a reverse screenscrape.  Its not pretty like an API would be, but it works.p  pIve seen apps interact with other apps in a similar way.  One good example I can think of is SnagIt, the screenshot utility.  You can order it to screen capture a window in a particular app, and as you move your mouse around that window, the controls under the pointer will outline in red to indicate which control it will capture for you.  I think that is interesting, and probably just a step away from actually being able to type text emintoem such a control.p  pThanks for the comments and answers so far, Im pursuing them all.p

Negative 6605 pAs part of a project Im working on in C I need to read in a .dbf file. The first thing I want to do is to get the schema table from the file. I have code that works as long as the filename without the extension is not longer than 8 characters.p  pFor example, lets say I have a file named MyLongFilename.dbf. The following code does not work it throws the following exception The Microsoft Jet database engine could not find the object MyLongFilename.

Now to get the schema table I try the followingp  precodeconnection.Open DataTable schemaTable  connection.GetOleDbSchemaTableOleDbSchemaGuid.Columns,     new object[]  null, null, fileNameNoExt, null  codepre  pThis returns a DataTable with no rows. If I rename the filename to 8 or less characters then this code works and I get back a row for each field in the database.p  pWith the long filename, I know the returned connection is valid because I can use it to fill a DataSet like so p  precodestring selectQuery  SELECT  FROM [MyLongF1DBF] OleDbCommand command  new OleDbCommandselectQuery, connection connection.Open OleDbDataAdapter dataAdapter  new OleDbDataAdapter dataAdapter.SelectCommand  command DataSet dataSet  new DataSet dataAdapter.FilldataSet codepre  pThis gives me back a DataSet containing a DataTable with all of the data from the dbf file.p  pSo the question is how can I get just the schema table for the long named dbf file  Of course I can work around the issue by renamingcopying the file, but thats a hack I dont want to have to make. Nor do I want to fill the DataSet with the top 1 record and deduce the schema from columns.p

Negative 6605 pI am planing a database to store lots of text. blog posts, news articles, etc. The database needs to have the title, content 50k characters max, date, link and language fields. The same content cant occur on one link. Old content older then 30 days, for example will be deleted.p  pNow, the problem is the primary key. I could just set a automatically incrementing SERIAL type field and use it as a primary key. But, it seems stupid and a waste of disc space, because the field wouldnt serve any purpose but to be a primary key. and the field could eventually run out, or not And theres always the other performance issue the content of each new row inserted needs to be checked for duplicates. So the other solution for the primary key Ive come up with would be to calculate a sha256 hash of contentlink value and then put that in a new hash column and use that as a primary key. Two birds with one stone. Of course, the problem with that are hash collisions.

Negative 6605 pIm using JavaScript to send textarea updates back to a server in realtime.  My HTML page uses a single XMLHttpRequest object to POST data to the server asynchronously.  The messages are sent potentially at every onKeyUp event, but because I only use a single XMLHttpRequest object I throttle the requests by only POSTing when the readyState is either 0 uninitialized or 4 loaded.p  pAgainst IIS6 on Windows 2003 Server, everything is working fine.  Against IIS7 on Windows 7 Professional, the readyState of my XMLHttpRequest object gets stuck at 1 initialized if I type in several characters quickly.p  pThe number of characters I can get in varies from 3 to 20 or so.  If I reload the page, I can enter in a few more characters until I get stuck again.  If I type slowly, then I can enter more characters before I see the problem.  [Could this have anything to do with connection limits on IIS7]p  pAlso, if I use GET instead of POST, everything works fine except that GET wont support the length of data I need to send.p  pHeres a snippet of the important bits of code here.

Negative 6605 pI am trying to figure out how to get my client to send and receive data simultaneously and am using threads.  My problem is that, depending on the way I set it up, the way here it waits for data from the server in the recieveFromServer function which is in its own thread and cannot stop it when nothing will be sent.  The other way it just waits for user input, and will send to the server and then Id call the function recieveFromServer after the client sends a message to the server which doesnt allow for fluent communication, but cannot get it to alternate automatically.  How do I release the thread when the client has nothing to be sent, or there is no more to be received from the server.p  pIt would get to long if I tried to explain everything I have tried. p

Negative 6605 pIm working on a small Windows Form application that will be run on a Netbook computer.  I will control the hardwareenvironment, meaning I provide the hardware and software to the end user.  It will have a single database on the local drive that only this one app will access.  It will have a couple tables and a few hundred or maybe a couple thousands rows in one of the tables.  No foreign keys, etc.  Really simple.  I just need a place to store this data and perform simple queries and map to objects ORM.p  pI understand the basics of Nhibernate and EF4 and have experimented a little with both.  Id use EF4 with POCOs if I decided to use EF.p  pI dont think performance is an issue because its a small amount of data.  But, Netbooks are not real powerful so Im wondering which of these two products would offer me a more lightweight solution.p  pWere a Microsoft shop and not using EF4 yet, but I think we may be going that way as our data engine of the future, so this may influence my decision.  But this app is kind of an island of its own so I could potentially use nhibernate without too much political fallout.   My general impression of EF4 and its wizards and generators and magic is that its bloated.  I may be wrong, but thats the feeling I get.  Id hate to select EF4 and find out its bogging down my Netbooks performance.p  pAny comments are welcome.  I know this is a wide open subject.  p

Its just that the codeDataTriggercode will not reevaluate and change to the correct template.p  pI know the codeDataTriggercode binding is correct because if i close the window and open it again, it will correctly apply the second datatemplate, because the codehasBeenAnsweredcode is set to codetruecode.p  pstrong[edit 1]strongbr Following on from comments made by Timores Ive tried the following  p  pusercontrol.xaml  p  precodeltListBox xNamecommunicatorListPhoneControls          ItemTemplateStaticResource communicatorCallTemplategt   codepre  papp.xaml  p  precodeltDataTemplate xKeycommunicatorCallTemplategt     ltLabel xNametestgtNot answeredltLabelgt         ltDataTemplate.Triggersgt             ltDataTrigger BindingBinding PathhasBeenAnswered ValueTruegt                 ltSetter TargetNametest PropertyBackground ValueBluegt             ltDataTriggergt             ltDataTemplate.Triggersgt     ltLabelgt ltDataTemplategt codepre  pWhat happens now is similar to the first example, when a call comes in the Not answered label shows one per call that exists as this is a listbox  normally when the window loads there will be no calls, the call is then answered and the proptery codehasBeenAnsweredcode is set to true, yet the Not Answered remains the same. If i close the window, and reopen it again with the active call still with the property hasBeenAnswered set to true the background is then blue. So it would appear to me like the datatrigger is simply not being run, until the window is rerun.p

Negative 6605 pOne of my colleagues is having a problem with an AJAX call to a .NET WebService.  The call works under HTTP, but the same call is having a problem under HTTPS.  The webservice is written in .NET 4.0 with C on an IIS 7 server.  p  pThe secure website is at a hrefhttpssql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearch relnofollowhttpssql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearcha.  There is an unsecured version at a hrefhttpsql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearch relnofollowhttpsql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearcha.  There isnt any sensitive information on the page itself.  It is embedded I believe in a frame on a clients website that does use HTTPS, and our page needs to be in HTTPS so browsers dont give a mixed securedunsecured elements present message.  p  pTo test the problem on the site you first have to enter a zip code in the second textbox I have been using 90210 for testing and then you can enter the first few letters of a drug into the third textbox.  After waiting a second or so for additional letters the page calls the webservice to populate a drop down list of possible drug choices beginning with the supplied letters.  The secure webservice call is to a hrefhttpssql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearchServicedrugNameAutocomplete.svcGetDrugList relnofollowhttpssql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearchServicedrugNameAutocomplete.svcGetDrugLista with POST data for prefixText and count.  Under HTTP the service call succeeds and populates the drop down  under HTTPS the call gets a 404 error.  The HTTPS web service is reachable if you point a browser to a hrefhttpssql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearchServicedrugNameAutocomplete.svc relnofollowhttpssql.datarx.comgrouppharmdrugsearchServicedrugNameAutocomplete.svca, but the method isnt recognized when it is appended to the service.p  pI have been using Firefoxs Tamper Data addon to compare the service calls and they appear to be exactly the same, except one is to the HTTPS site and one is to the HTTP site, with the referrers changing appropriately.  The HTTPS call receives the 404 error, while the HTTP call receives the JSON data.p  pI believe there may either be something missing from the webservice that would allow the call to function under HTTPS though I cant think of anything that should matter in this case, or the HTTPS web site itself was misconfigured when it was setup.  Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 6605 pIm trying to switch from AjaxControlToolkit to jQuery UI tabs for a fairly simple tab element.  Im 99 there with CSS and theming, but Im running into a wall attempting to get rounded corners on the tabs in IE.  jQuery UI provides the styles needed for rounded tabs in better browsers, but it might be a dealbreaker if we cant get them in IE.p  pI would emreallyem hate to have to keep using the Toolkit, and would also prefer not to bring in a different plugin to do the tabs although this is an option.p  pI tried .htc files, and while it may have easily been my fault, I could not get them to work for me.  CurvyCorners threw exceptions until I got tired of it and moved on.p  pAre there any IE roundcorners solutions that we KNOW can get along with jQuery UI tabs, or any workarounds specific to the tabs  I do not need rounded corners anywhere else.p  pP.S. Tabs can be of different lengths, so using presized background images really isnt an option.  Using multiple images, or resized images, would be fine as long as they can support arbitrary tab lengths.p  pThanks a lotp

In my WAR I have configured my web.xml to use the org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener. This works fine and I can see when I deploy the war that the applicationCOntext is loaded up. Now how do I wire this up so I can use Autowired in my Apache Axis2 service endpoint classp  pThanks for any help in advance Kylep

Negative 6605 pIm trying to create a DOCX in memory that I can provide for a Drag amp drop operation.p  pI first tried Embed Source.

Negative 6605 pFor daily backup of my mercurial repositories on Windows XP I used a simple batch file codehgbackup.batcode which just did some directory changes and mercurial calls with a codepausecode command in the end like thisp  precodeZ cd hgbackupdrawings hg pull v cd hgbackupsrcscripts hg pull v cd hgbackupeagle4lbr hg pull v pause codepre  pThis worked fine with mercurial up to 1.7 installed with TortoiseHg. However since mercurial 1.8 it starts the very first mercurial command and then exits abruptly without reaching the following commands or even the end of the script. The command window just disappears.p  pI had the same problem some time before, when I tried the same thing with git, but didnt investigate further, because I use git for one repository only. It seems to me, theres some return code of the hg command line call involved which causes the script to end instead of executing the other command but I couldnt verify this yet.p  pHas anyone an idea why this happens or maybe even how to fix itp
Negative 6605 pIm having a problem with this tiny script I wrote for a website Im creating. Im totally new to JavaScript, so forgive me if Im missing something that might be obvious to you.p  pThe aim of the script is to hide a div as soon as the page is loaded, and then to show it when the user clicks on an element in a dropdown menu. Here it isp  precodedocument.readyfunction  cdcpanel.hide  contrpanel.hide  clickme.clickfunction      cdcpanel.show200, function           contrpanel.hide200   clickme2.clickfunction      contrpanel.show200, function           cdcpanel.hide200   hideall.clickfunction      cdcpanel.hide200     contrpanel.hide200    codepre  pAs you can see, the divs codecdcpanelcode and codecontrpanelcode are initially hidden. Clicking on the element called codeclickmecode will cause codecdcpanelcode to be shown and codecontrpanelcode to be hidden. Clicking on the element codeclickme2code, instead, will trigger the opposite event. The problem is that it wont work on other browsers apart from Firefox. Ive tried it up on Chrome and IE and the result is that the div is initially hidden, but then nothing happens by clicking on the dropdown menu. This script relies on JQuery. Its called at the beggining of the page using the followingp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjsshow.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pAny suggestion on how to make things work is welcome Thanks in advance for your time and patience.p

Then, inside a performance critical algorithm, I would like to choose the object that both has the property X emandem has the least size in case there are multiple such objects, choose any of them. I need to do this choosing multiple times, and both the holding of the property X and the size may vary in between the choices, so that the objects are in a way dynamic here. Both queries property, size can be made in constant time.p  pHow would I best achieve this Performance is profiled to be important here. My ideas at the momentp  p1 Use stdminelement with a suitable predicate. This would probably also need boostfilteriterator or something similar to iterate over objects satisfying property Xp  p2 Use some data structure, such as a priority queue. I would store pointers or referencewrappers to the objects and so forth. This atleast to me, feels slow and probably its not even feasible because of the dynamic nature of the objects.p  pAny other suggestions or comments on these thoughts Should I just go ahead and try any or both of these schemes and profilep

Negative 6605 pI have a main STA thread that calls a lot methods on the COM object and a secondary STA thread that does a lot work on the same object too. I want the main thread and the secondary thread to work in parallel i.e. I expect interlaced output from the main and the secondary. I know I need to pump messages in the main thread every now and then  calling GetTranslateDispatchMessage in C will do the trick.p  pBut Im having problem getting the same strategy working in C. At first I used CurrentThread.Join in the main thread to give control to the second thread. It didnt work. Then I turned to Application.DoEvents  I called it in the main thread whenever I wanted the second thread to run. The result is the second thread quickly grabs the control and wont let go  the main thread cannot continue until the second thread is all done.p  pI read documents that say Application.DoEvents will process ALL waiting events  while GetMessage retrieves only one message.p  pWhats the correct thing to do Is there C equivalent of GetTranslateDispatchMessagep  pThanksp  pUPDATE The second thread is running too fast, sending a lot COM call messages to the main STA thread. I just added delays in the second thread to slow it down. Now two threads are basically running in parallel. But I still would like to know if there is C equivalent of GetMessageTranslateMessageDispatchMessage.p

Negative 6605 pI have inline javascript within my HTML. Each individual component that requires animation or action sliders, expanding text areas, etc. each have their own inline script, that sets up the animation and such for that individual component.p  pThe way i have it set up, Each script is position dependent it references its own position in the DOM, and traverses it to find the component it wants to manipulate e.g. add onclick to the parent div. This is normally an incredibly bad idea for several reasonsp  ul lihaving to repeat the same code all over the place, losing DRYli libeing very verbose, repeating the same chunk of text over and over, taking up bandwidthli licluttering up your HTML with a bunch of inline scripts, making it hard to readli ul  pHowever, the second problem is easily solved with GZIP, and i have solved the first and last problem. p  pThis has the advantage of locality of reference the component and the scripts they require are kept in one place, not spread out over separate files. Also, I isolate each set of scripts in a function, and avoid polluting the global namespace, so each set of scripts for each component is written once and doesnt interact with scripts written elsewhere at all. Perfect modularityp  pSo the question is, how can i stop JQuery eating my script tags when i do Ajax DOM insertionsreplacements If it didnt eat my scripts, because each component is completely selfcontained with its own scripts, i can simply run every script tag in the new components DOM and that would be that everything will be set up. No more fiddling with decided which global scripts need to be rerun depending on which component changed. p  pHowever, since JQuery seems to insist on stripping my script tags and moving them somewhere, this no longer works. I could do the insertion by modifying replacing the HTML of the entire document, but that causes the whole screen to flash as it reflows among other problems. Any ideasp

Negative 6605 pI have developed a fairly large CRUD application, using a MYSQL Database and Swing Application framework and javax.persistence.  My question is how should I best manage my transactions given the javax.persistence.Entitymanager Currently, I have one instance of Entity manager held by the Application class. It is passed to all requesting pages, which in turn use it to persist and merge entities. I start a transaction on application startup, and commit and restart each time a change is made.  Is this correct or should I hold a seperate Entity Manager for each Component  page When should I commit All these questions arised now, because I have recently started to get exceptions of the type java.sql.SQLException Lock wait timeout exceeded try restarting transaction Error Code 1205 which led me to believe I am doing something wrong in my management of database transactions....p  pThanks in advance for any help you can give mep

Is there a way to let the user change the instances they want and do a bulk submit  Or should have it autosubmit on something like an onChange event for each instance individuallyp

Negative 6605 pBackground One of the problems with using a local static variable in a function as an implementation of the singleton pattern is that if more than one thread calls the function for the first time at the same time, the initialisation of the static variable could be done twice.p  pMy question is, if you wrap the initialisations of the static variables in a critical section, will that prevent the double initialisation from happening Examplep  precodeCRITICALSECTION cs  Class getclassinstance      EnterCriticalSectionampcs       is the initialisation of c done inside the critical section     static Class c  Classdata      LeaveCriticalSectionampcs      return c  codepre  pOr is the initialisation done magically not at the point of the declarationinitialisation, like the initialisation of variables member before the beginning of a constructorp  pMy question is specifically about preC11 since, as per Xeos answer, C11 takes care of this by itself.p

Negative 6605 pThe server is intended to be a multithreaded server which spawns new threads upon either a producer or consumer connection via TCP. My problem is that Im getting stuck in a wait state once a producer client fills the queue. This snippet shows the servers handling of a producer connection. The format of the request the producer sends is PUT itemp  precode    reqline[0]  strtok mesg,  tn    if  strncmpreqline[0], PUT0, 40                          item[0]strtokNULL, tn             pthreadcreate amppro, NULL, producer, fifo             pthreadjoin pro, NULL                codepre  pSo you can see Im creating a new thread which handles the job of filling the queuedetecting when it is empty.

The server is obviously waiting for a condition which can never be met, considering a consumer thread was not started to eat up the queue. I was thinking that I should change the condition to wait for an incoming consumer connection and then start a consumer thread. But then it seems silly to do so within this method. If I send a consumer request while in this state nothing happens.p  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciated. Im not sure if this design is feasible. p

Negative 6605 pI have master branch of the project. Then I want to add a new feature so I create a new branch called newfeature, base on master branch. In newfeature branch, everything works fine and I want to delete some files that are no longer useful. But when I switch back to master branch  and merge with newfeature branch, these deleted files still exist. Here is my question what I have to do to make master branch is exactly the same as the newfeature branch so I can delete newfeature branch. Thanks in advancep

Negative 6605 pI need to add some jars from JRE7 library to my Android project. But for example codert.jarcode is in conflict with codeandroid.jarcode from Adroid 2.2 SDK, so I get this errorp  blockquote   pIlladvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax.   when not building a core library.p      pThis is often due to inadvertently including a core library file   in your applications project, when using an IDE such as   Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a   core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats   going on.p      pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core   namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,   from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most   assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the   compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.   It is also often of questionable legality.p      pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only   appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine   distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use   the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p      pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact   building an application, then be forewarned that your application   will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be   prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your   application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating   system. You will be to blame for this problem.p      pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a   core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to   repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into   your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in   conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help   you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then   that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately   lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.p blockquote  pI know there have been several threads about it and things like a hrefhttpcode.google.compjarjar relnofollowJarJara, a hrefhttponejar.sourceforge.net relnofollowOneJara or a hrefhttpfjep.sourceforge.net relnofollowFatJara might be good for me.

But I would also like to be able to add the very same .jar to standard Java project in order to use some functions there as well. It would look like this Whoever writes an application adds this .jar to his Java project  it enables him to generate certain files internet is needed to do it  these generated files are then added to Android project  later on, when somebody uses this Android app, these files provide certain functionalities without using internet offline.p

Negative 6605 pLets take this example. I have a AView which is bound to AViewModel. AView should execute an ACommand on AViewModel, and pass it a parameter. The problem is that ViewA doesnt have enough information to pass to command, so another BView needs to be displayed, in order to gather information from the user. After the VIewB is closed, ViewA invokes ACommand on AViewModel, and passes parameter to it.p  pHow to handle this scenario Should I allow AView to communicate directly to BView, or I am breaking some rule if I do sop  pAnother way I am thinking is to invoke a ACommand on AViewModel without a parameter, then from VIewModelA send a message that a information is required to complete the task. This information is captured by MainPageViewModel, than sends a request to open BView, which is bound to BViewModel. When BView is closed, a BVIewModel sends a message with additional info, and ViewModelA has subscribed to this type of message, so it receives it, and completes the task. Pretty complicated for just entering values in two text boxes, right p

Negative 6605 pI generally dont bother to install Python modules. I use web2py, and just dump them in the modules folder and let it take care of the local imports.

Negative 6605 pSo I have a wee javascript app that receives a pair of numbers from a server every minute or whatever and over the course of the minute it updates a div every second or whatever so that the value shown in the div gradually increments from the first value to the second.  Its only short, Ill post the code at the bottom of the question.p  pThe function contains two sub functions  one of them does the ajax call to update the two values, one of them updates the div contents with a value somewhere between the two values.  The ajax function uses setInterval to schedule the div updating function when it has the response from the server, and when the div updating function detects that its time to update the two values it clears the set interval and calls the ajax function.  These two functions thus carry on calling each other for ever.p  pI declared every variable used by the two sub functions in the outer function, so neither sub function creates any new variables, and both subfunctions are allowed to finish completely each time anyway thanks to the setInterval in the ajax function.p  pThe memory usage is going up almost every second, which must be every time doDivRefresh is called, but I dont understand what its doing with new memory each time its called  it doesnt create any variables.p  pHelpp  precode      Periodically gets the latest values for a stat and changes the contents of a   div so that is ticks up from the previous value to the latest value      param divID              The id of the div to update   param URL              The URL that provides the values   param updateDivFrequency              How often the value displayed in the div is updated, in              miliseconds   param updateDataFrequency              How often the underlying data is updated from the server, in              seconds      function updateStatOverPerioddivID, URL, updateDivFrequency, updateDataFrequency      var somethingDoer  new function               var request  new XMLHttpRequest     var currentValue       var previousValue       var latestValue       var it  0     var currentTime  new Date     var endTime  new Date.getTime      function doDivRefreshendTime              if currentValue  null                      currentValue  currentValue  it             document.getElementByIddivID.innerHTML  addCommasparseIntcurrentValue                  else                      document.getElementByIddivID.innerHTML  ltDIV CLASSerrormessagegtNo dataltDIVgt                   If its time to refresh the data end this loop and call the starting          off method again         currentTime  new Date         if currentTime.getTime gt endTime                      clearIntervalsomethingDoer             doAJAX                    function doAJAX               If browser supports javascript         if window.XMLHttpRequest                       Connect to the server and get the new pair of values             request  new XMLHttpRequest             request.openget, URL             request.onreadystatechange  function                               Once...                 if request.readyState  4                                       weve got...                     if request.status  200                                               the response                         if request.responseText                                                       Parse the response and work out our iterator                             previousValue  parseFloatrequest.responseText.splitamp[0]                             latestValue  parseFloatrequest.responseText.splitamp[1]                             if previousValue  0  latestValue  0                                                              it  parseFloat0.00                                                          else                                                              it  parseFloatlatestValue  previousValue  updateDataFrequency  updateDivFrequency                                                           Set up the doRefreshDiv function in a loop that                              will exit and recall this function                              once updateDataFrequency has elapsed                             currentValue  previousValue                             endTime  new Date.getTime  updateDataFrequency                             doDivRefreshendTime                             somethingDoer  setIntervalfunction                                                              doDivRefreshendTime                             , updateDivFrequency                             alertend of ajax response function                                                  else                                                      document.getElementByIddivName.innerHTML  ltDIV CLASSerrormessagegtError  no data received from serverltDIVgt                                                                   else                                              document.getElementByIddivName.innerHTML  ltDIV CLASSerrormessagegtError  server returned   request.status  ltDIVgt                                                                request.sendnull                  else                      console.errorNo window.XMLHttpRequest, does this browser support AJAX                  alertend of doAJAX            Start     updateDataFrequency  updateDataFrequency  1000     doAJAX  codepre

Its also not really multiplatform Android and iOS support is a minimum.p  pstrongAnywaystrong, I looked into ASP.NET SPA, and I kinda liked the idea, but in the other hand, I think HTML5javascript are decades far from Silverlight, first of all CVB.NET as a language, then all the related tools, such as EntityFramework, WCFRIA with scaffolding and validation, SDKToolkit and more.p  pSo my question is if there is any kind of way to make a generator that turns my Silverlight website into HTML5CSS3Javascript so it works on every platform, perhaps by converting it to a SPA app.p  pHave you ever heard about any existing project that covers this issue Do you think its doable or it will take me years to develop itp

Negative 6605 pin a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19798018211841bnbyrindex.html relnofollowthis linka theres lack of information on making 2 containers trust each other, quote from Trust between Containers p  blockquote   pWhen an enterprise bean is designed so that either the original caller identity or a designated identity is used to call a target bean, the target bean will receive the propagated identity only. The target bean will not receive any authentication data.p      pThere is no way for the target container to authenticate the propagated security identity. However, because the security identity is used in authorization checks for example, method permissions or with the isCallerInRole method, it is vitally important that the security identity be authentic. Because no authentication data is available to authenticate the propagated identity, the target must trust that the calling container has propagated an authenticated security identity.p      pstrongBy default, the GlassFish Server is configured to trust identities that are propagated from different containers. Therefore, you do not need to take any special steps to set up a trust relationship.strongp blockquote  pThe last part scares me. But anyway, I would like to know how to make 2 containers trust AND not trust each other, and if this is possible between Tomcat 5.5 and Glassfish 3.1.2 because I need to use the RunAs from 1 container to the other another.p  pTo further clarify my problem, I will tell you what I have to do and my solutionp  pIm making a Restful webservice to allow a client download a file, this webservice is located at CONTAINERA, but before downloading the file, the webservices makes a call on an EJB in CONTAINERB to get the path of the file from a Database, also in CONTAINERB. The thing is, I want to make sure that calls on the EJB from CONTAINERB are only accesed by the webservice in CONTAINERA, and Im using the RunAs annotation in the webservice so it acts as an AUTHORIZEDROLE. The thing is, the client that access the webservice, lets call it the WEBCLIENT, doesnt have to be authenticated to access the webservice, but the EJB in CONTAINERB is secured to only be accesed by AUTHORIZEDROLE.p  pIs it clear Or am I over complicating things Is there a better approach Because the RunAs solution is only usable when I make the JAXRS webservice a Stateless bean also, and its discouraged to use file system operations like reading the file and sending it back, but for now is the only solution I can think of.p

Negative 6605 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pRecently, I have been tasked with parsing a large amount of data out of an HTML form and building it into a workable database table.  The HTML page in question was generated a long time ago, and the original source data has been lost to the ages.  Thus, I have decided to toss off a quick parser in Java to grab this data and format it appropriately.  SAX is to be leveraged, as I do not need to modify the hierarchy in any way and a single pass is all that is needed.  A very small sample of the HTML is included belowp  precodelthtmlgt  lttablegt   lttrgt    lttablegt     lttrgt      lttdgtltdivgtDistrict 1ltdivgtlttdgtlttrgt     lttrgt      lttdgtltdivgtValid Code 1ltdivgtlttdgt      lttdgtltdivgtValid Code 2ltdivgtlttdgt      lttdgtltdivgtValid Code 3ltdivgtlttdgt     lttrgt    lttablegt   lttrgt ETC... codepre  pObviously, there is more to the HTML than just what is outlined above but this should give an idea of the structure.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI am looking for an intelligent, extensible, selfdocumenting, and if possible fast  lean method of tracking my current location in the XML hierarchy using a SAX parser.  Since , using SAX, I have three discrete method calls that are only triggered for a single element, this state must be persistent and storable.  The obvious and easiest method of doing this would be a mountain of Boolean variables, but that is none of the prior four tenants that I have laid out.  I have also considered bitmasking to maintain a large number of flags, but that is hardly selfdocumenting or very extensible.  Finally, I have considered a Finite State Automata or another similar derivative such as a Pushdown Automata but those seem somewhat overkill for a oneoff.p  pPerhaps I am overthinking the problem for a oneoff bit of code, bit I am always looking to expand my skill set for the times I have to write code that is not oneoff.

But If I run the client in other computer in the same lan, then I have many problems.p  pFor example, if I try to store a small file, 50kB, I dont have problems, but if I try to store the file of 6MB, then I can get different errors.p  pFor example, if I configure in the client a low timeout, for example 1 minute, I get the errorp  pSystem.TimeoutException This request operation sent to net.tcp192.168.1.57997CMMSHost did not receive a reply within the configured timeout 000100.p  pIf I configure the client to have a timeout of 10 minutes, then I get the following errorp  pThe server did not provide a meaningful replyp  pThe service is hosted in a wpf application, and in the Begin method of the serve that add the document in the database, I send a text with a log to know if the call is received or not.

Negative 6605 pI am trying to create a custom sidebar navigation pane in my iPad app something like Instapaper for iPad. With the help of some excellent tutorials like the one a hrefhttpwww.scottsherwood.comp777 relnofollowby Scott Sherwooda, I was able to create a custom sidebar and switch between the view controllers.p  pI implemented this using a root view controller in which I have two views  one is the tabbar view, other represents the content associated with the tab selected, something like this...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXVxrB.png altenter image description herep  pWhenever I select the tab I just add a subview to the codeRoot View Controllercode, like this...p  precodeimplementation RootViewController    some code here   define TABBARWIDTH 80.0F  voidbuttonTappedUIButton aButton      UIViewController newVC  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierSomeView]     [newVC.view setFrameCGRectMakeTABBARWIDTH, 0, self.view.bounds.size.width  TABBARWIDTH, self.view.bounds.size.height]     [self addSubViewnewVC.view]  codepre  pNow what I want to do is push a new view into the codeContentscode not based on tab selection but based on some interaction in the contents view. The way I have figured out to do this is adding another subview to the superview. In that case, however I will have to implement the pushing, popping, back buttons, animations between views all by myself.p  pI was wondering if I can implement this scenario using UINavigationController so that the pushing, popping, back buttons are handled automagically.p  pCan somebody shed some light over this topic May be even a brief overview of how this could have been implemented in a hrefhttpwww.instapaper.comiphone relnofollowInstapaper iPad appa would help.p
Negative 6605 pIm changing state on a model view and I was wondering what would be a clean way to find out the collection the model is referenced from.p  pEssentially it works like this when a model is triggered to turn on it needs to first go up a level and have the collection query the other models and turn any that are currently on to off.  Right now Im passing each model view a reference to the collection view it comes from so it can query the collection from there, but I feel that might be bad practice. p

Negative 6605 pEssentially, I want to create a program that will run some untrusted code that defines some method or class, and then run an untrusted rspec spec against it.p  pIve looked into sandboxing Ruby a bit, and a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv6XxCOYco3Eg relnofollowthis videoa from rubyconf was particularly helpful. After looking at several solutions, the two that appear to be the most helpful are a hrefhttpsgithub.comenvylabsRubyCop relnofollowrubycopa, which essentially does static analysis on the code, and the a hrefhttpsgithub.comomghaxjrubysandbox relnofollowjruby sandboxa both covered in above video. My instinct tells me that the jruby sandbox is probably safer, but I could well be wrong.p  pHeres a completely unsafe example of what I want to dop  precodecode  ltltRUBY class Person   def hey     hey   end end RUBY  spec  ltltRUBY describe Person do   letperson  Person.new     it says hey do     person.hey.should  hey   end end RUBY   code and spec will be from user input unsafe  eval code require rspecautorun eval spec codepre  pWhich all works fine, but the code obviously needs to be sandboxed. It will be a matter of minutes before some genius submits codesystemrm rf code, codefork while forkcode or something equally dangerous.p  pI made various attempts with the jruby sandbox...p  precodesand  SandboxSafe.new sand.evalrequire rspecautorun sand.activate  lock it down sand.eval code puts sand.eval spec codepre  pThat code throws this exceptionp  precodeSandboxSandboxException NoMethodError undefined method require for ltRSpecCoreConfiguration0x7c3cfaabgt codepre  pThis is because RSpec tries to require some stuff after the sandbox has been locked down.p  pSo, I tried to force RSpec to require stuff before the sandbox gets locked down by calling an empty codedescribecodep  precodesand  SandboxSafe.new sand.evalrequire rspecautorun sand.evaldescribe   sand.activate  lock it down sand.eval code sand.eval spec codepre  pAnd I get thisp  precodeSandboxSandboxException NameError uninitialized constant RSpec codepre  pWhich basically means that codeRSpeccode doesnt exist in the sandbox. Which is odd, considering codesand.evalrequire rspecautoruncode returns true, and that the earlier example actually worked RSpecs autoloader started to run.p  pIt may be a problem with gems and this particular sandbox though. The sandbox object actually supports a method coderequirecode, which is essentially bound to codeKernel.requirecode, and therefore cant load gems.p  pIts starting to look like using this sandbox just might not really be possible with rspec. The main problem is trying to actually load it into the sandbox. I even tried something like thisp  precoderequire rspec sand.refRSpec  open access to local rspec codepre  pBut it wasnt having any of it.p  pSo, my question is twofoldp  ul liDoes anyone have any bright ideas on how to get this to work with the jruby sandboxli liIf not, how secure is a hrefhttpsgithub.comenvylabsRubyCop relnofollowrubycopa Apparently a hrefhttpcodeschool.com relnofollowcodeschoola use it, so it must be pretty well tested... it would be nice to be able to use ruby 1.9 instead of jruby as well. li ul

And that becomes a big problem when there is a logic complex user interaction.p  pI wonder, how to simplify this logic Remember that Im with.

But I know That it would work very well, for example, I could use it in all the events of controls without bothering to freeze the screen. My knowledge about generic types, covariance, contravariance is limited, maybe this code can be improved.p  pI thought of other things using codeTask.Factory.StartNewcode and codeDispatcher.Invokecode, but nothing that seems interesting and simple to use. Can anyone give me some lightp

Negative 6605 pI have something like the StackOverflows Ask Question page, where a textbox is used to put source markup code and, below, another textbox noneditable is used to render a preview of the postquestion being typed.p  pConsider that my application not only lets me use a simple tiny markup language for my posts content it also provides me with the possibility to type math in it using a hrefhttpwww.mathjax.org relnofollowMathJaxa. But the syntax is simple Latex syntax however this is not the problem, so do not let this thing bother you too much.p  h3The problemh3  pThe problem is the following. The page is a little different from the StackOverflows one because it uses ASP.NET with AJAX in order to call a serverside procedure that performs the markup language translation in HTML this is my choice, I have the code serverside, there is no implementation in javascript of the markup translation code.p  pWhen the asynchronous script runs every 10 secs, the noneditable textbox is refilled with the translated markup. The Latex code as well is put there no translation performed on it and MathJax script is called everytime the AJAX procedure returns so the latex code will be rendered after the markup language, this latex rendering happens clientside. p  pThe problem is that, sometimes, rendered math is strange especially considering equation numberings. Numbers do increase every new AJAX call. I guess there must be a way to reset, completely, the status of the MathJax object instantiated in the page or whatever... Is there a way to reset MathJaxp  pI assume that AJAX here is the problem... Thankyou for your help, hope I was clear.p

Therefore subclasses can override the method   shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch to declare statically if they [sic] shouuld   indeed be invoked, once, during both types of dispatches in order to   provide thread initialization, logging, security, and so on.

Negative 6605 pI am implementing my own custom DialogPreference subclass that has a SeekBar used for persisting an integer. Im a little confused about what needs to go into codeonSaveInstanceStatecode and codeonRestoreInstanceStatecode. Specifically, do you need to update the UI widget that the user interacts with in my case, the SeekBar widget in codeonRestoreInstanceStatecodep  pThe reason I am confused is that the API doc article a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuisettings.htmlCustomSaveStateherea tells you to do thisp  precodeOverride protected Parcelable onSaveInstanceState      final Parcelable superState  super.onSaveInstanceState     if isPersistent          return superState           final SavedState myState  new SavedStatesuperState     myState.value  mNewValue lt saves mNewValue     return myState   Override protected void onRestoreInstanceStateParcelable state      if state  null  state.getClass.equalsSavedState.class          super.onRestoreInstanceStatestate         return           SavedState myState  SavedState state     super.onRestoreInstanceStatemyState.getSuperState     mNumberPicker.setValuemyState.value lt updates the UI widget, not mNewValue  codepre  pBut looking at the source for some official Android Preference classes a hrefhttpsgithub.comandroidplatformframeworksbaseblobmastercorejavaandroidpreferenceEditTextPreference.javaEditTextPreferencea and a hrefhttpsgithub.comandroidplatformframeworksbaseblobmastercorejavaandroidpreferenceListPreference.javaListPreferencea, the UI widget is not updated in codeonRestoreInstanceStatecode. Only the underlying value of the Preference is in the example above, that would be codemNewValuecode.p  pHere is the relevant source for EditTextPreferencep  precodeOverride protected Parcelable onSaveInstanceState      final Parcelable superState  super.onSaveInstanceState     if isPersistent          return superState           final SavedState myState  new SavedStatesuperState     myState.value  getValue lt saves mValue     return myState   Override protected void onRestoreInstanceStateParcelable state      if state  null  state.getClass.equalsSavedState.class          super.onRestoreInstanceStatestate         return           SavedState myState  SavedState state     super.onRestoreInstanceStatemyState.getSuperState     setValuemyState.value lt updates mValue, NOT the UI widget  codepre  pSo, whats the consensus Where I am supposed to update the UI widget if I am supposed to update it at all...p

Negative 6605 pMorning guys. I will try to be as short as possible.  We are using CRM 2011 on premises. Currently the way data flow works is that we have two systems system X and System Y. System X have all customer information regarding purchase and System Y have all the information regarding customers subscription choice. news letter etc p  pWe bring these two database together and merge it in to one and then using thirdparty service, push it in to the CRM. we process these data thats dedups rows, checks for data quality etcp  pPROBLEM start when the third type of data gets entered in by customer service. This guys uses Outlook to push data in to CRM this are the only data that goes directly in to CRM This last method creates lots of duplicates and makes it imposible to use this data for better customer service and reporting.  Few important info over 99 of data in form of cases entered in to CRM by customer service are of customers who already exist in CRM These are the data that came from System X and System Y. The existing data have all the details email, postal address etc.. but duplicate data that is entered by Customer service only have basic info like Firstname, Lastname and Email address.p  pwhat is the best solution to 1. merge these datas and 2. Avoid duplicates when entered by customer services I tried using dialog but its asking end user in customer service to manually pick details they want to keep from each row. Some time these rows are more then 23.  I am sorry for making it so long but this issue seems to not going away. I am not looking for full on solution from you guys but any tips, link or if you have tried some thing like this before. p  pMany thanks for your time. p

Here codencode has a different meaning, codencode is the number of rows and each row can have up to codemcode integers which in turn can be found inside the codeComparatorcode class by overriding the codeoperatorcode function and using extra variablesthe vectors and for loops.p  pBecause Im not sure how exactly is STLs codesortcode implemented I can only make some estimates.    My initial estimate would be codeOnmlogncode where codemcode is the number of columns that are important to the sorting however Im not 100 certain about it.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 6605 pI have a Java class which contains a native handle pointer which is only used by the native JNI methods. Lets use this class Found at a hrefhttpthebreakfastpost.com20120123wrappingaclibrarywithjnipart1 relnofollowhttpthebreakfastpost.com20120123wrappingaclibrarywithjnipart1a as an examplep  precodepublic class Plugin      private long nativeHandle      protected Pluginlong handle          nativeHandle  handle           public native String getIdentifier     public native String getName     public native String getDescription     public native int getPluginVersion codepre  pp  pSo the handle in this example is private. JNI doesnt care about the visibility. But source code analyzers like the one in Eclipse complain about the field because it is unused. Eclipse cant know that there is some JNI code which accesses this field. p  pSetting the field to protected or public is also a bad idea because then the handle can be modified from the outside directly or by extending the class which results in a crash. Packageprivate is not that bad but the default settings of source code analyzers like checkstyle complain about bad programming style.p  pSure, I could add a codeSuppressWarningsunusedcode annotation to silence the eclipse warning or I could add some comment so checkstyle ignores the issue or disable the check in checkstyle completely. But Im not sure if this is needed or if I simply do it wrong. p  pSo is there some best practice for the visibility of native handles in classes which use JNI code Or maybe they can be somehow avoided in Java code completelyp

Negative 6605 pI am currently in the process of learning Ruby. I have some knowledge of Java EE.

Now Rail create a objectoA of a controllerA and call a specific method of that objectoA.m.p  pfrom here the control goes to the view with controller objectoA available to the embeddedruby code in the view. Now we use this oA object to fill the dynamic data in the view. Let say this view is render within a layout which contain the code for rendering the other 3 section of the appliation.p  pNow for for successfully running the code the oA object should also have the dynamic content required by the layout view.p  pIf i am able to explain it correctly and  the above case make sense to you then below is the specific question Dont you think that with increasing section in application each controller has to provide data for the complete application. Against dont repeat yourself p  pWhere as if we have the backing object corresponding to every UI section then we would only be working in controller for that specific view.p  pI know i am missing some pattern or might be looking thing the wrong way. Could anybody please respond with what i am doingthinkingusing the wrong way.p

For example, the itemstoolbar referred to above is in a Handlebars template like thisp  precodeltdiv classrow toolbargt     ltdiv classcol collg6 textrightgt         outlet submissionoptionsbutton         outlet submissionbutton         outlet createbutton         outlet confirmbutton         outlet cancelbutton         outlet folderactions         outlet itemrename         outlet itemdelete     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pIn this template, not all the outlets will get a buffer rendered into them, and in other contexts they will.  Im doing this to avoid undesirable confusing conditionals in the Handlebars code and the usual isVisible nonsense.  Im interested in a given template wearing its views as needed in some instances there may be a createbutton and a cancelbutton and in other cases there may be a cancelbutton and a folderactions.p  pIs there any surefire way to ensure that when reentering a route that any objects that were previously rendered in it, then destroyed, could be reconnected, reinitialized, andor rerenderedp

Negative 6605 pI am creating an app that has a static uitableview with three large cells. I would like each cell to have its own navigation controller that operates within the cell.

Negative 6605 pIm not sure about the best way to express a relationship between models in my Laravel 4 application. I have three models that I am using to store information in a database codeEmployercode, codeEmployeecode and codeUsercode.

I think the following expression is the best I can think ofp  ul licodeEmployercode has many codeEmployeecodeli licodeEmployeecode belongs to one codeEmployercodeli licodeEmployercode belongs to one codeUsercodeli licodeEmployeecode belongs to one codeUsercodeli ul  pIn the database, I am going to have a codeuseridcode foreign key in both the codeemployerscode and codeemployeescode tables that reference the codeidcode field in the codeuserscode table.

Negative 6605 pIm having quite tough problem while developing a testing framework for android apps. The text got a bit long so the actual question is in bold for those that dont want to read the context.p  pBasically, what Id like to achieve right now is to trace user activity while hes using the application as one of the features. Theres my app that manages context data all the time and developers app  the one being tested. My idea to do this was to get coordinates where user touched the screen along with taking a screenshot simultaneously. Then Id use the coordinates to mark the spot on the screenshot to get the idea of what user was doing the whole time with the app. Take hints on user experience and trace crashes.p  pNonsystem apps cannot take a screenshot for security reasons, but application itself can take a screenshot of its Activities without much trouble for nonrooted users, e.g. like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5651242944734herea. My only hope here is to interfere with developers code to implement the functionality of doing so while my testing app is running. strongEach Activity then would have to extend my overridden Activity instead of regular one, implement an interface, implement broadcast receiver etc.strongp  pstrongI am going to write a library for developer who would like his app to be tested with my framework. Id like it to do the job for me and be as nonintrusive as its possible for him to use. How to achieve that the best waystrongp  pstrongIdeal case would assume linking the library to project with maybe a small addition in manifest thatd get the job done and after just unlinking, removing that bit of xml in manifest for production.strongp  pThats an open question.

Negative 6605 pBased on a a hrefhttpwww.reddit.comrPythoncomments1qjfcdhowdoigrabtheaddressbarcontentfroma relnofollowquestion I read and responded to on Reddita, Ive been investigating using the relatively new Windows UI Automation framework via Python and pywin32 to query custom widgets inside a Google Chrome window. UISpy shows me the control Im interested in, but the naming conventions and lack of window classes make me believe the UI Automation framework is the only way to access it. I was able to get as far as generating a COM stub for the UI Automation library via PythonWin and the Makepy utility, but couldnt actually instantiate the COM object. I dont have a lot of experience with COM, outside of following along in Mark Hammonds Python Programming on Win32 to drive Excel via COM with Python. I found an a hrefhttpwww.codemag.comArticle0810122 relnofollowarticle describing how to instantiate the COM object from CCa but I wasnt able to get much from it.p  pI think I can follow along with the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopee67121628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowAPI documentationa if I can just figure out how to instantiate the object.p

Negative 6605 pThis is a difficult one to figure out. We have a solution that includes a User Application and a WCF Service that use the same back end business layer code to create API calls to an external application. Most of the API calls happen just fine from either the two work flows. However, one specific API call does not work correctly in the WCF Service bit. p  pEssentially, my question is why would an API call work in a User Application that tests the API call, basically running the process from the UI, and not when it is called from the Service layer an automated process. We are trying to login to an application and the API calls are working from our User Interface which builds the back end process, but when it is running through the automated process, the API call is not working.p  pHave any of you run across this particular issue Any help would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 6605 pIn a complex solution I have a mix of native C library, CCLI wrappers and C assemblies. In the wrappers I often have to use native types so I have to make them public using codepragma makepubliccode. The problem with those pragmas however is that you often get linker error LNK2022 as discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4121249bestworkaroundforcompilererrorc2158makepublicdoesnotsupportnativeteherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12645105lnk2022duplicatemanagedtypeshavedifferentvisibilitiesonmsvs2012herea and many other places.p  pThe usual solution is to collect all pragmas in one place to avoid the duplicate type error. So far the only reliable place I found was to put the list in my codestdafx.hcode header file. This is however annoying as it causes my entire project to recompile as soon as I have to add a new native type there its my precompiled header.p  pId like to extract that list to a separate header or, even better, cpp file. But my attempts so far have not worked. The types where not made public. It also seems I have to put the codepragma makepubliccode calls in a header file. Id prefer a cpp however.p  pSo, what other possibilties exist Where do others place their codepragma makepubliccode callsp

Negative 6605 pmost likely a clueless question but I would like to start off on the good foot Despite trying my best, I have actually never really learned to program and Im kind of learning as I go so please excuse me if this seems very obvious to you... Its more of a suggestion and feedback kind of question rather than pure programming.p  pMy situation is the following Im building a racing game that would receive various inputs from a number of users through a php website, I am storing that information in a MySQL database, and once a week I would like to process all that information to generate lap times, which will then create a race my output. Not taking into account the various methods of calculating that output, I need to do two important things which Im not sure how to begin with at all p  p1 Storing the race information for every user lap time per lap, fastest lap, race position per lap, race position at end of race, award points depending on the position. Where and how should I optimally store those informations  I have created a race DB with a unique identifier that auto increments, Im thinking I will generate 1 set of data for each race, so should I store all the information pertaining to that race in there  Would I then create a data row with type time for the lap time informations 1 row for lap1, 1 row for fastest, etc...  But how would I know which user I have a unique userID for each did which lap how would I assign the userID to the lap timep  p2 At the end of the race I need to award points depending on race position at the end, should I just compare total lap times additional row and sort by lowest first  The points data would be stored in the user DB p  pI appreciate any input you might have for the modeling of this project p

Negative 6605 pI see many posts about what codeThe type ... is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.code means but those posts dont cover this problem as far as I recognize.p  pI have a Library strongAAAstrong that has signalR as a dependency.  The dependency should be of almost no consequence but one of its details in reflection might matter somehow.p  pI have two other Executable projects in the same solution called strongBBBstrong and strongCCCstrong, both with seemingly identical project references to strongAAAstrong and use strongAAAstrong identically to selfhost signalR with all the signalR usage fully encapsulated.p  pFor months until yesterday, both strongBBBstrong and strongCCCstrong compiled just fine.  Now, with no meaningful changes I can find to the .cs files, the .csproj files, or otherwise, I get codeThe type Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hub is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.code when compiling strongBBBstrong but NOT when compiling strongCCCstrong.p  psignalR requires that any codeHubcode implementations are marked codepubliccode.  So in strongAAAstrong, codeMyHub  Hubcode implementation emisem codepubliccode.  Otherwise it could be private.  There are no references to it in the other libraries, no members of strongAAAstrong types which return a codeHubcode or a codeMyHubcode.  If I mark codeMyHubcode private, both project compile fine.  but it fails at runtime because of signalRs reflection logic expectationsp  pWhats extra unhelpful is that the compiler error squiggles on just the first file in the strongBBBstrong project which happens to be mostly empty, one of the most barebones files on the codeBBBcode of the codenamespace BBB code block.  p  pMaybe this is a distraction, but Im also confused how it decides on this file because even if I change the file name or the class name inside to zzzClassName for example, it still picks that same file as the one to show the error in every time, unless I remove the file all together from the compilation which conveniently happens to be mostly dead code at the moment anyway.  If I remove that file, the error moves to some other file consistently instead, also on the namespace line.  The short of it is that the ordering used to chose this first file doesnt seem to be alphabetical by filename, class name, nor by order in the .csproj file.p  pIF I NEEDEDUSEDEXPOSED a MyHub object in strongBBBstrong or strongCCCstrong, strongI would expect to get this exceptionstrong, but I dont expose it or use it.  Again, if I merely change codeMyHubcode to be codeprivatecode instead of codepubliccode, all compile fine but wont run.  Either way, strongCCCstrong is compiling just fine, and I cant identify any meaningful difference in the code or the .csproj including the project references to strongAAAstrong.  This just started happening, perhaps due to a code change though I cant find it or a cleaning out of old conflicting assemblies.p  pI have cleaned and rebuilt.  Ive even manually deleted .dll from explorer.  Ive checked the GAC for old versions of an assembly a possibility.  I have removed and readded the project references.  I have closed and reopened VS 2012.p  pHave you hit this before  What do I need to look for  What besides an exposed Hub or Hubderived type or typed member could require a direct reference  If, when merely the MyHub is marked private it compiles fine, what could BBB possibly be upset aboutp  pThanksp

Negative 6605 pI spend 2 hours trying to convert one example from Scala lang to Java lang, the example are simple in scala but prove to be more trick in Java than I expected.

Maybe saving each conversation in a string is not the best idea. I bet you can help me or give me some tipps.  thank you. p

Negative 6605 pIm currently trying to discover the idea behind emaggregate rootsem and their relation to repositories.p  pGiven are the following domain entitiesp  precodepublic class Country       public string Name  get set      public ICollectionltCitygt Cities  get set     public class City       public string Name  get set    codepre  pI guess I correctly identified strongCountrystrong as an emaggregate rootem for strongCitystrong since in my domain, there shouldnt be any cities that are not located within a country. It should be only possible to add a new city to the data storage via a country and if a country gets deleted, every city inside should be removed too.p  pNow, how does such a strongCountry Repositorystrong might look like And how does the strongCountry Aggregate Rootstrong look like Is there a strongCityRepositorystrong inside the domain which would allow me to add a city to the database even if there is no related country And is there a strongCountryRepositorystrong inside the strongCountrystrong somehow the country needs to populate its cities Or is this the job of a repositoryp

Negative 6605 pMy app schedules an RTCWAKEUP alarm that goes off at userdefined intervals. When it fires, I register with Location Services for coarse updates citylevel is more than good enough, wait up to 60 seconds for a single location report, unregister the listener, and then make a locationspecific web query and do various things with the information thats returned.p  pIve been testing in environments where there should always be at emleastem a wireless network available to use for a location fix. The procedure works fine almost all the time, but the log shows that once in a while, the app times out waiting for a location report. This seems to only happen when the alarm wakes the device from sleep emandem the device is deep inside a building where the mobile network connection is flaky. Under these circumstances the wireless network is I think the only possible source of location information, so my hunch is that either a the wireless network is not automatically reconnected when an alarm wakes the device from sleep until someone tries to open a connection, or b 60 seconds just isnt long enough.p  pCan anyone confirm whether either of these things is true If its a, is there a command I can issue that amounts to reconnect the wireless network and then get back to mep  pI could fiddle around with the timeout interval, but even if that appears to solve the problem, I wont be confident Ive truly addressed the root cause until I understand whats going on...p  hr  pSome nittygritty detail about the procedure When the alarm is received, the app kicks off an codeIntentServicecode that registers a codeLocationClientcode with Location Services. It then enters a codewaitcode loop that gives up and returns failure after 60 seconds. The client in turn registers a codeLocationListenercode from its codeonConnectedcode. When that listener receives a report, it stores off the codeLocationcode and codenotifyAllcodes the waiting thread. This is what the codeLocationRequestcode looks like I only want one report, but I want it as fast as possiblep  precodeLocationRequest request  LocationRequest.create request.setPriorityLocationRequest.PRIORITYLOWPOWER request.setInterval0 request.setFastestInterval0 request.setNumUpdates1 codepre

Negative 6605 pIt is difficult to have full control over how pdf document is rendered on the web browser adjusting the zoom, page size, etc. when it is embedded in an html document. So, I am considering to convert pdf documents in advance into formats such as svg or png, and embed them into an html document instead of embedding a pdf file. A multipage pdf document will correspond to multiple files of svg or png, which will be stored in a directory. I can handle the change of page according to the user input using JavaScript, and that is not a problem.p  ol lipGiven that the pdf documents are scanned documents at around 300dpi, black and white, and the converted file should have a comparable quality, what format would be best suited for this situation mostly in terms of rendering speed on the browser I understand that cache will change the speed, so I want to limit my consideration to when the pages are rendered for the first time. I have svg or png in mind. Which one is better, or is there a better format that can be easily be converted to from pdfpli lipWhen a bitmap document such as png is zoomed to a different size, I understand that it will be jaggy. On the other hand, if I feel that, if I have a svg file that embeds such scanned parts, antialiasing will work, removing the jagginess. Is my understanding correctpli ol

Negative 6605 pHeres my situation I have a task in which I need to make some operations using TClientDataSets yes I have to use this specific component. The user will be able to edit the data inside the TClientDataSet, so Im using a TDBGrid connected to a TDataSource, which is connected to my TClientDataSet.p  pWhat I need to do is to prevent the user from leaving the cell moving the focus to somewhere else in the program based on its value. A valid value is a time starting from 0000 to 2359. It cannot be empty or have blank characters. Im using the EditMask property of the TClientDataSets fields so its very easy to type straight in the right format.p  pExample If the user typed 2900 in the cell, and then tries to move to another cell or another component, I want to be able to stop that, and make him enter some other valid value in the cell like 1500, then he can leave it and do something else like editing another cell.p  pWhat are the options to make this kind of validation Im using Borland Delphi 7.p  pThanks. p

Negative 6605 pIm aware of and have used two methods in the past for basic tree structures adjacency lists and nested sets. I understand several pros and cons to these approaches  e.g., that adjacency lists are quick to update but slow to query, that nested sets are the opposite slow to update, quick to query.p  pHowever, I require the ability to store more complex treelike structures. The best way to describe this is using human family relationships. My first thought was that each element could have both a ancestors tree and a descendants tree. However, there will be significant redudancy in this approach as, using the example below, both Cameron and Kelly will share all of Bobs ancestor tree and updates will be even more time consuming, as an insertion to the tree will actually have to insert into multiple trees. My second thought was to include tree references. E.g., say that Alice has her own ancestor tree. Both the 4,5 element coming from Camerons ancestor tree, and the 2,3 element coming from Kellys ancestor tree would simply reference Alices ancestor tree. This second approach requires less data storage, would experience faster updates only an update to a single tree vs. multiple trees and would retain the speed advantages of querying a large tree structure although the SQL to query such a selfreferencing nested set is rather complicated. However, a drawback to the second approach is that the data becomes fragmented much like inodes on a hard drive.p  precode A  Alice                                    B  Bob                                      C  Cameron                                  J  John                                     K  Kelly                                                         2 Bob 3            4 Alice 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1 Cameron 6                                                         2 Alice 3            4 John 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1 Kelly 6                                                                                 1 Alice 6                                                                                                                                                                                      2 Cameron 3        4 Kelly 5               codepre  pFor the second approach, I am visualising multiple nested sets stacked in front of one another, with certain nodes drawing a line along the zindex to a node on another plane.p  pNote that the above is just an example  Im not actually storing human relationships, but I am storing complex tree like data. There are many reasons to store such complex hierarchical structures, so Ill let you imagination run wildp  pThe question strongWhat is the most efficient way performance wise updates and selects of storing complex, selfreferencing tree structures in an SQL databasestrong Im specifically referring to PostgreSQL, but if you have alternatives even to SQL itself, Im open to hearing that as well.p

Negative 6605 pI have implemented a number of services in asp.net Web API.

Negative 6605 pIn the Layout for an activity of my Android app, I need to have a line with a text aligned on the right side of it like below p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtbS91.png altenter image description herep  pAnd this is my XML so far p  precode        ltRelativeLayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt              ltView                 androidididline                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheight1dp                 androidlayoutmarginLeft15dp                 androidlayoutmarginRight15dp                 androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue                 androidbackgroundandroidcolordarkergraygt               ltTextView                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtext Text                  androidlayoutalignRightidlinegt           ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pBasically the issue is that the width of the line is changed according to the width of the screen and width of the text. It should be the width of screen minus the width of the text. p  pIn my XML file, the width of the line is equal to the width of the screen and the text overlays the line aligned in the right. Which is not what I wanted.  One idea is to make the background of my text equivalent to the background of the activity. However, Im not sure if this is the best idea. p  pIm wondering if there is any other way to address such problems in Android design. p

Negative 6605 pI have a class which processes messages received from the cloud, this class extends IntentService. For now messages bundle extras are put inside a notification. But I need to start and pass these extras to another activity dialogActivity which prompts the user to take action and then then displays the full message.p  pThe only way I could start a new activity from inside this class was to add FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK to the intent which starts it. But in this case messages overlap each other, I mean new messages are not shown because of this flag which stops the activity to start a new task while another is already opened.p  pI cannot use other flags either because my app crashes and Logcat suggests to use FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK to avoid further crashes.p  pIs there any other way to start my dialogActivity from within this classp  pThanksp

Negative 6605 pUsing a hrefhttpsphinx.pocoo.org relnofollowSphinxa and a hrefhttpdocutils.sourceforge.net relnofollowreStructuredTexta, would it be possible to define math macros to make substitutions in a math Latex formulap  pBasically, I would like to have something likep  precode.. bnabla replace mathboldsymbolnabla .. vv replace mathtextbfv  .. math rho mboxDt vv   bnabla p  rho textbfg  eta bnabla2 vv,  where vv is the velocity and bnabla is the nabla operator.  Then follow many other equations with vv and bnabla... codepre  pbut it does not work at all. First the flags are not substituted in math mode and second, even if they were substituted, a codemathcode statement does not work in a code.. mathcode block. Would it be a good idea and not to complicate to change these two behaviours in Sphinxp  pAnother solution would be to use latex macros as in this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq97282921779806Creating LaTeX math macros within Sphinxa but I think the final code would be simpler to read with local rst substitutions as in my example. I would like to have clear formulas that can also be read in text mode.p  pMoreover, I am using the MathJax extension so I cannot use the variable pngmathlatexpreamble. I could use this solution for MathJax a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma192685491779806httpstackoverflow.coma192685491779806a but it seems quite complicate and once again the code would be clearer with local rst substitutions.p  h2Edith2  pI realized that it would be very convenient and useful for many people to implement a codemathmacrocode substitution directive directly in reStructuredText i.e. in the Python package docutils. The new directive should work like thisp  pDefinitionp  precode.. bnabla mathmacro boldsymbolnabla .. vv mathmacro textbfv codepre  pThese math macros could be included directly in text as inp  precodebnabla is the nabla operator, codepre  pwhich should produce an inline equation like this p  precodemathboldsymbolnabla is the nabla operator. codepre  pThese macros could also be included in inline equationsp  precodeThis is an inline equation mathvv  bnabla f,  codepre  pwhich should be equivalent of p  precodemathtextbfv  boldsymbolnablaf codepre  pThey could also be included in block equationp  precode.. math vv  bnabla f codepre  pwhich should be equivalent ofp  precode.. math textbfv  boldsymbolnablaf. codepre  pHowever, I am really not familiar with how docutils works internally. I notice in particular that the MathBlock directive defined in docutilsparsersrstdirectivesbody.py does not call any parsing of its input so there is no substitution in math mode.p  pI do not know if it is possible to change the behaviour of a substitution directive such that the substitution is cleaver and adapt to the context from where it is call, in text, in inline math or in block math.p  pDoes someone can give me some clues on how to implement this useful new featurep

Negative 6605 pI write my R scripts in RStudio. I have also started using the Rmarkdown notebook feature of RStudio. As part of my workflow, I would like to have R scripts that include some R code evaluated when I source the code and when I render a notebook, and other R code that is evaluated only when I render the notebook, but not when sourced.

This same file could also be used to manipulatee.g. source the working data frame from the data sources. Sourcing the file would just result in munging the data, without generating the graphics or tables.p  pIs there a way to do this already in the framework I described p

Negative 6605 pI am very new to python. I was trying to pass value from one method to another within the class. I searched about the issue but i could not get proper solution.

Negative 6605 pIs there a way I can store form information using javascript and jquery to the variable first and only when user hits submit button, save that data, else discard it. p  pI know html forms do the same, but I have an example where I can add multiple content using same input field and when user clicks add button content is sent to controller via ajax and manipulated then inserted in database and displayed from database entry instantly. But I dont want to save that data to database beforehand, only when complete form is submitted.p  pSo I want to save that data to some array first not directly to database, display it and save it to database only when user clicks submit button and sends the entire form to the server.p

Negative 6605 pI have a production application IIS8, MVC5, nHibernate DAL and Im noticing high CPU usage as of late. Cycling the app pool fixes it but after doing some diagnostics and memory dumps from the server to analyze the issue, I noticed a consistent pattern of multiple threads trying to enumerate the same collection.

I suspect this might be more do to the fact that this code is ran for every request to verify permissions, so its more likely to be the collection it gets stuck onp  precodepublic IListltRolegt GetRolesstring username      var login  GetLoginForUserusername     return login.Groups.Any  new ListltRolegt  login.Groups.SelectManyx gt x.Roles.OrderByx gt x.DisplayName.ToList  codepre  pMy CurrentUser object there is a simple interface containing the details of the user, injected from a dependency resolver.

When I checked the two threads in the dump, I saw practically identical stack traces. Ive renamed some of the namespace details in the stack trace but its otherwise unaltered. The userId and resulting profile in both requests are the same, so it appears its due to two separate threads trying to load the same object from the database at practically the same time.p  pThe

Negative 6605 pI am working with the MongoDB C driver. I have a codeBsonDocumentcode with some data which includes some MongoDBspecific types like ObjectIDs and ISODates. I want to convert this to a valid generalpurpose JSON string. In other words, I cant have something like codeid ObjectId...code or codedate ISODate...code but would prefer codeid ...code and codedate ...code. Basically, I want to convert these special types that only MongoDB recognizes to regular strings so they can be parsed more easily. The problem is that a builtin function like code.ToJsoncode which another StackOverflow answer suggests doesnt really convert the document to valid JSON at all because it maintains these special types. My document also contains many levels of arrays and subdocuments, so a simple for loop will not suffice. Whats the best way to convert a codeBsonDocumentcode that avoids this problem I would prefer something builtin rather than manually recursing through the document to fix all the issues. p

Negative 6605 pi have a problem with ZF2, where i dont have an idea how to solve it.p  pMy Problem is, that i need to use a custom XMLAPI from a middleware as a Datapprovider for Entities.  The Application shouldnt have a database connection. It should be only a frontend for a middleware and handle data froma middleware. p  pAuthentication of users, management of products and etc should happen over the middleware. So for oop reasons i want to fill entities with data from the xml api of the middleware.p  pI saw that zend provides Modules for XMLRPC, JSON and Soap APIs. The API from the middleware is custom and not standard.p  pNow i am confused about how to implement it.  At first i would be happy if anyone can answer me the question, how to implement a custom API into a ZF2 application. Should i implement a new adapter Or is there a better way  p  pAt second, how do i pass the response from an api to entities p
Negative 6605 pstrongMy basic questionstrong In the Adobe Brackets editor how do I use jshint while turning off or disabling jslintp  pstrongMy tldrstrong When linting javascript in the Adobe Brackets editor I find that I get results for both jslint and jshint. While I have jshint configured to my liking I can never avoid the warning symbol that appears indicating I have failed to pass jslint so it always looks like there are problems with my linting. I only want to use jshint as the ability to globally configure it via the .jshintrc file is quite useful but I dont see a way to turn off jslint and still permit jshint. Anyone know how to do thisp  pI suppose I could dump jshint and just use jslint but since the latter requires the configuration to be stuck directly in the JS file I dont want to do this.p

Negative 6605 pStuck on how to pull something off.p  pMagento natively has the ability to set the Category Navigation Max Depth. 0 shows all 1 shows top level only 2 shows top level and first child as a dropdown and ect..p  pWhat I am attempting to do, is the equivalent of it being set to 1 for desktop size. 0 for mobile size.p  pWhat I tried and found an unexpected bug, was to simply put a displaynone on the sub wrapper class for the dropdown on the 768px media query.p  pVisually, that did the trick. The dropdowns were hidden on desktop nav, and revealed themselves in mobile.p  pBut... this creates an ipad bug. Even though the sub nav is technically hidden via Displaynone, the javascript that fires the dropdown is still there. p  pOn desktop, thats an onHover event. On ipad, the idevice natively turns it into an onTap event.p  pSo what happens, is you have to tap the navigation link multiple times to get it to click through to its anchor page because even though the sub nav is display none... the site is still firing the javascript to show and hide it before eventually letting the anchor to the associated page take over.p  pSo, Display none on media query is not the option that works.p  pI need to either Dynamically change the value of Category max Depth based on screensize from 1 to 0 and viceversa. or Find a way to get rid of the the javascript action calling the dropdown based on screensize 768x kill it, lt768px keep or enable it.p  pHope the above makes sense in writing.p  pAny codebased suggestion or solutions would be hugely appreciated.p  pthanks everyone Davep

Negative 6605 pIm doing some development work on an Access 2013 database.  Originally, it was designed so that the record source was set at design time and a filter was added to restrict the records on Open.  For a couple of reasons, I changed this to where the record source is being cast in code as the form opens  Me.Form.RecordSource  SQLstrp  pBut when I do this, where the form should be displaying 5 records, it only displays 1 and that is a new record.p  pWhen I look at the query in the design screen, the query returns the correct record set.p  pCuriously, when the form is open, at the bottom of the form, the filter button is yellow.  When I click on that, the whole set shows.  When I click it again, the set does not change, but continues to show the same correct set.p  pI dont see any code in the filter there was, but Ive removed it. If I clear the Filter in code, then the filter button is disabled and I can only see the one record.p  pDoes anyone see something Im missing herep  pThanks  Alanp

Negative 6605 pI am building out a monitoring and automation system for my various greenhouses in the garden. Due to the number of devices that need to be controlled and monitored rather than purchasing additional Raspberry PIs I decided to go with a GPIO port expander and make use of the existing Raspberry PI hardware.p  pI have however managed to hit a wall when it comes to reading the DHT22 Temperature and Humidity sensor when I connect it up via the MCP23017. I know I have the MCP23017 connected correctly as I am able make LEDs flash and relay switches turn on and off. p  pNone of these require reading data from the device connected though and this where I am running into the problem and would really appreciate any help or advice.p  pI am running a Revison 2 Raspberry PI A, sudo i2cdetect y 1 shows MCP23017 connected to 0X20.p  pI am using Python 2.7 for the coding, using the AdafruitDHT module and for addressing the MCP23017 I am using the wiringpi2 module. Although I am open to other suggestions here with regards to using wiringpi2.p  pThe AdafruitDHT uses the following syntax to connect to and retrieve information from the sensorp  precodeimport AdafruitDHT     sensor  AdafruitDHT.DHT22 pin  7    humidity, temperature  AdafruitDHT.readretrysensor, pin codepre  pThe above works fine when connecting directly to one of the standard GPIO ports. However I have not worked out how to address the additional new GPIO ports in this same manner i.e.p  pI have tried the following with no successp  precodeimport AdafruitDHT import wiringpi2 wiringpi2.wiringPiSetupGpio wiringpi2.mcp23017Setup65,0x20  for n in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16   humidity, temperature  AdafruitDHT.readretrysensor22, wiringpi2.digitalReadn64   print n, humidity, temperature codepre  pSo the above cycles through each new port, however I dont get any results back, as I say if I connect the device directly the GPIOs on the PI is works fine. I suspect the issue with how I am telling the driver which PIN to use. p  pI would really appreciate any advice or help on this issue. As I said I am open to other ideas on how to use this DHT22 with the MCP23017.p

Negative 6605 pWhat I am trying to achieve is integrate SonarQube analysis into the build process, so that whenever codemvn clean installcode is run, the code is analyzed with SonarQube. We want to use it for local analysis and also for build on Jenkins. If new issues are found, than the build should fail we want to use build breaker plugin for that. This way the developer would know that by his code his is going to introduce new issues, and will have to fix them for the build to work. p  pWhen I run codemvn sonarsonarcode, the analysis takes 30 seconds, which is OK. p  pHowever, the problem occurs when I am trying to bind codesonarcode goal to maven build phases. I bind codesonarcode to codeverifycode phase. The build takes strong5 minutesstrong now, which is too long. It should take about strong1 minutestrong. The build itself, without SonarQube analysis takes 30 seconds.p  pstrongNotestrong may help to figure out what the problem is the project on which the build is run has multiple modules in it, and I guess that is the problem. It looks like codesonarsonarcode goal is executed multiple times, once for each submodule, and the strongwholestrong project is analyzed multiple times not only the submodules. So, we have 4 submodules, and the report is generated 5 times during the build.p  pInstead, we want to analyze the whole project only once, not 5 times. Its also important for this 1 analysis to be run at the end of the build, after the strongcoberturastrong reports are generated for all modules.p  pSo, how do I integrate SonarQube analysis into the build, so that it analyzes my multimodule project only once, in the end, after cobertura reports are generated for all the submodulesp  pstrongSonarQube plugin properties in parent pomstrongp  precodelt Sonar plugin properties gt ltsonar.jdbc.urlgtjdbcurlltsonar.jdbc.urlgt ltsonar.analysis.modegtpreviewltsonar.analysis.modegt ltsonar.issuesReport.html.enablegttrueltsonar.issuesReport.html.enablegt        ltsonar.issuesReport.console.enablegttrueltsonar.issuesReport.console.enablegt ltsonar.host.urlgtsonar.host9000ltsonar.host.urlgt ltsonar.languagegtjavaltsonar.languagegt ltsonar.buildbreaker.skipgtfalseltsonar.buildbreaker.skipgt ltsonar.qualitygategtSonar20way20with20Findbugsltsonar.qualitygategt ltsonar.preview.includePluginsgtbuildbreakerltsonar.preview.includePluginsgt ltsonar.exclusionsgtfiletargetltsonar.exclusionsgt ltbranchgtdevelopmentltbranchgt codepre  pstrongPlugins configuration in the project pomstrongp  precode                lt Run cobertura analysis during package phase gt                 ltplugingt                     ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.mojoltgroupIdgt                     ltartifactIdgtcoberturamavenpluginltartifactIdgt                     ltexecutionsgt                         ltexecutiongt                            ltphasegtpackageltphasegt                               ltgoalsgt                                  ltgoalgtcoberturaltgoalgt                                ltgoalsgt                         ltexecutiongt                   ltexecutionsgt                 ltplugingt                  lt Run sonar analysis preview mode during verify phase.

Negative 6605 pI have a problem using the fancybox plugin with an iframe. My current setup isp  pLoad news articles in a bootstrap modal, which contains an iframe from another domain from the news system  so for example i am on page.domain.com and load content from news.domain.com, where every news article is provided. So everything works great, but i have problem when ill try to open a fancybox gallery.p  pWhen i use the fancybox like thisp  precodea.lightbox.fancybox openEffect none, closeEffect none, titleShow true, titlePosition inside, helpers       title           type inside       ,     thumbs           width 90,         height 60      , beforeLoad function  this.title  this.element.findimg.attralt   codepre  pThe fancybox opens on every item with class lightbox, and everything looks fine. But in the iframe, it get opened inside the iframe. But i want to open the gallery outside, in the parent window.p  pSo normally i use p  precodeparent..fancybox codepre  pBut now, i am loosing the stronga.lightboxstrong selector. So i would need to manually push the items like thisp  precode beforeLoad function     here i need to read out all images in the same group, and push it modally              this.group.push                  href ... image1, type image, title Picture 01, isDom true ,                  href ... image2, type image, title Picture 02, isDom true                         codepre  pBut i dont think that is a good option for me. p  pIs there an better way how to open a fancybox in the parent window, using the standard stronga.lightboxstrong.... selector p

My first idea was just to pass the entire linked Database to the view and then pull out what i needed from there. p  pSo the controller would look something like this just sends everything to the view.  p  precodepublic ActionResult Detailsint id      if id  null             return new HttpStatusCodeResultHttpStatusCode.BadRequest           ViewBag.SelectedDetail  id      Recipe recipe  db.Recipes     if recipe  null              return HttpNotFound               return Viewrecipe  codepre  pThen all the filtering would happen in the view... kind of like this yes this is ugly and it creates the wrong table structure, i was going to fix it once i got it figured out.  p  precodeforeach var item in Model.RecipeDetails      if item.RecipeID  ViewBag.SelectedDetail              if item.Ingrediant.AHItems  null                      x  x  item.Ingrediant.AHItems.Cost                    lttrgt             lttdgt               Html.DisplayFormodelItem gt item.Ingrediant.IngrediantName             lttdgt             lttdgt               Html.DisplayFormodelItem gt item.Quantity             lttdgt             lttdgt               Html.DisplayFormodelItem gt item.Ingrediant.AHItems.Cost             lttdgt          lttrgt      if item.Ingrediant.RecipeID  null              y item.Ingrediant.RecipeID         foreach var i in Model.RecipeDetails                     if item.RecipeID  y                          lttrgt                 ltthgtItem Nameltthgt                 ltthgtAmount Neededltthgt                 ltthgtAH Costltthgt              lttrgt              lttrgt                lttdgt                     Html.DisplayFormodelItem gt i.Ingrediant.IngrediantName                lttdgt                lttdgt                     Html.DisplayFormodelItem gt i.Quantity                lttdgt                lttdgt                     Html.DisplayFormodelItem gt i.Ingrediant.AHItems.Cost                lttdgt              lttrgt                                                                                           codepre  pSo while I think i can make the above work it seems like it is a lot of extra work to be done in the view. How do i move this into the controller instead p  pemP.S. Is there a way to see what the full linked table that the model will make looks like for the example above when recipe is passed to the view without having to code something to see it I would like to see the joins and how the query is written so i can better understand what it is doing.em p

Negative 6605 pI have just switched to Ubuntu and Ive installed IntelliJ IDEA 14 Community Edition. When I imported my existing project, I found that IntelliJ cant seem to find any of the LibGDX dependencies. I installed Gradle beforehand. Ive tried using the Gradle wrapper included with the IntelliJ project to and saying code.gradlew refreshdependenciescode, but this doesnt seem to do much of anything. My external TweenEngine packages were loaded just fine. It seems to only be with the LibGDX packages that IntelliJ is having a problem with. I do not wish to have IntelliJ see my project as a Gradle Project, as then it will have to sync. I prefer to do things myself in that regard.p  pMy guess is that Gradle isnt installing the LibGDX dependencies, but Im not entirely sure why that would be happening. Shouldnt code.gradlew refreshdependenciescode install them The errors I get are all the same as this one, just with different package names and different line numbersp  precodeError7, 24 java package com.badlogic.gdx does not exist codepre  pThe line numbers correlate to my LibGDX class imports, so this is what leads me to believe that Gradle is not installing the dependencies.p  pWhen I imported the project, I selected the build.gradle file.

Negative 6605 pIm very new to objectiveC and iOS development. I have some confusion. Im following a tutorial and he creates a UITableView in the IB. He then adds the protocols for connecting the new TableView object to the viewcontroller as suchp  precode   interface viewControllerUIViewCOntroller ltUITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDatagt codepre  pThen he fulfills a required method for one of the protocols as such in the viewController implementationp  precodeUITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath codepre  pMy question is pretty simple, what are each of the identifiers in this definition. My understanding is that the required method is cellForRowAtIndexPath. from what I know about objectivec this syntax would imply that tableView is the name of this method and it returns UITableViewCell and takes a UITableView object tableView. I know that cant be correct if the method that needs to be implemented is cellForRowAtIndexPath.   After that the syntax is confusing me. I feel dumb, Ive been programming for years and I cant get my head around some of these xcode and iOS app structure concepts. Basically I just need full clarification on this syntax. Thanks.p

Negative 6605 pI am in the process of developing a forum with PHP and MySQL. I got stuck in a problem that i have never came up with before. The problem occurs when I am invoking a method to edit a forum post.p  pI have a object class to handle behaviors of a post. And I am trying to make the forum SEO friendly too, therefore I am using Unique URLs to identify posts as a experiment. So bare with me if i have made threatening security holes and please be kind enough to point them out toothank you.p  pI will copy only the required parts of the code. p  pThis is where i invoke the methodp  precodeurl  GET[url] postsgteditForumPostheading, desc, catetgory, username, tags, url codepre  pAnd to be sure if its not an array i codeprintrurlcode which gives me the correct url sent in the address. I am familiar when I codeprintrcode an array, it says that it is an array and gives the indices and their values too. Its not like that in this case.p  pSo in the editForumPost function I call another function like thisp  precodepost  thisgtgetPostDetailsurl codepre  ptake note here, that I am using this same function to get the values of the post to print it to display to the user. and I dont have a problem there, But when i call the function inside the editForumPost function I get a p  blockquote   pArray to string conversion in blah blahp blockquote  pI cant think of a reason why this happens.

That is why I am so puzzled and wondered if anyone has ever encountered something like this. One thing to note is that the view controller having this issue is buried several screens deep within a codeUISplitViewControllercode. Not sure if someone UI elements buried deep in the nav stack are somehow intercepting the keyboard callp

Negative 6605 pIm trying to synchronize data between our custom system and Exchange using ECS. Primarily I want to synchronize calendar events, including recurring events.p  pIve identified two approaches, but both of them seem flawed in some way  as such, Im looking either for a third, hopefully complete approach, or a solution to make either of the existing two approaches workable.p  pThe issue is that I cannot use EWS events to perform the synchronization. Think of my system as an offline client with only occasional internet access the reality is different, but this is a very good comparison for this problem. Even if I add synchronous events for my system i.e. creating a new calendar event in my system will synchronously create it in Exchange, I still need a way to reliably sync data.p  pAs such, my first instinct was to manually synchronize events using a timestamp of the last synchronization event and checking the modified dates of local and Exchange items. It WOULD work, exceptbr a Creating a recurring exception or even modifying an EXISTING recurring exception changes the modified date on the master recurring event, causing a mess.br b When creating meetings using EWS, Exchange can and does modify events after they have been created by updating the acceptance status. Again, the problem is with recurring events and the exceptions to these events.p  pThe reason recurring events are such a pain to work with is because changing the master event removes all the exceptions in both the local system as well as Exchange.p  pThe other approach Ive discovered was to use the codeSyncFolderItemscode method. This seems to work only one way, however. It seems to me this is ideal if all I want to do is keep an local readonly status of an Exchange folder. I need twoway synchronization. This, Id need to run the sync process, then upload any new events created by my client, then sync again My gut tells me this is overkill and the whole operation should be simpler.p  pAt this point Im a bit stuck. I can probably make the first method work, but it feels messy, with a ton of conditions conflict resolution is one of those things.p  pWhat could I do to sync the calendars quickly and efficientlyp

But when Task Scheduler executes the .BAT file it fails. The script is then unable to include some files that the PHP script calls. Im guessing thats because Task Scheduler doesnt execute the script from the directory the PHP script is in. CronjobBase.php has a line that includes codeMyIncludes.phpcode examplary, in real life a bootstrap file is includedp  pThis is my .BAT content theres no difference in using or leaving the quotes with the CD commandp  precodecd DxampphtdocsMyAppAppCronjobs Dxamppphpphp.exe f CronjobBase.php MyCronJob codepre  pIm trying to CD into the Cronjobs folder to execute CronjobBase.php with codeargv[1]code as MyCronJob which should include MyCronJob.php from CronjobBase.php. It tells me CronjobBase.php is not found.

Negative 6605 pIm trying to run my angular e2e tests with protractor. Ive got some situations where a select exists inside a modal.

Negative 6605 pIve got two tables, Table1.groovy and Table2.groovy. Table1 has a hasMany relation to Table2, and Table2 belongsTo Table1.

I know the id from Table2, and I would need the id from Table1, what is connected to this Table2 id  question is, how can I access a table, what does not have a .groovy file, and only existing in the database Looks like executeQuery can only access tables through their .groovy name. Is there any method  I could go deeper, into the physically existing database Or at least somehow get to know their idsp

Generic function should populate codecreatedTscode if found in a codecase classcode instance it was passed, if it doesnt find codecreatedTscode in an instance of a case class then do nothing. p  pI have tagged slick for this question because these are slick generated case classes not the reason for tagging but I assume this can be a common need generically populating such timestamp columns when dealing with slickdatabases in general. To clarify, I am not looking for db based solutions like triggers etc but something at an application level also without using structural types.p  pstrongEditstrong Providing default value to codecreatedTscode in codecase classcode declaration is not a desired solution. That will stamp wrong timestamp when codecase classcode instance is created for an update query. p

Negative 6605 pSo, im used to use jarowinkler and else in order to match stings that our customers provides us and using those pcts to find the customers at our database since we dont really have a Key as most of the other places have, like SSN, SIN, CPF and stuffs like that, we cant ask the customer for this info, so... the thing is, im trying to use the same jarowinkler function that im used to, but now, to let the customer able to input 1 typo wrong on their dates of birth, but, now comes the bad part, depending on the disposal of the wrong typo, it keeps changing the result, i had calculate 0.96 as expecting result once the customer places a wrong typo... but, as you can see bellow, depeding on where i change the typo, it keeps giving me different kinds of results. p  pChanging the last typo at year from 60 to 61p  pcodeSELECT UTLMATCH.jarowinkler 12101961,12101960 FROM DUALcodep  pit gaves me the accurate rating that i was expecting which is 0.96p  pbut using a different day, by one typo as well, as you can see bellowp  pcodeSELECT UTLMATCH.jarowinkler 11101960,12101960 FROM DUALcodep  pThe pcts drop ALOT and goes to 0.873333333333333p  pIve tried to combine alot of different kinds of changes regarding 1 wrong typo, and the result changes everytime, depending what is my set of data, the disposal and else, so, im wondering if there is a way to set the matching more static maybe, to just compare the whole sting and give me the result based on the whole sting and not based on the disposals and elsep  pPlues, ive tried to used different kinds of masks, as YYYYMMDD and else, nothing works so far..p
Negative 6605 pI am a beginner and this may be programming basics that I am missing here, but this is the only way Ill learn these things.p  pBelow is my MainActivity code. It is trying to get details of the last location and read them into a class which I defined class is called UserCurrentAddress so that I can use those details. p  pI have declared the UserCurrentAddress class in the MainActivity class and then instantiated in the onCreate. I then use a button click onClickView at the bottom of the code to connect the API and get the location. The handleNewLocation method eventually populates the UserCurrentAddress object and this works successfully. However when I try to read those details from the UserCurrentAddress in the buttonClick event just using a Toast it comes back as null. If I put that toast in the handleNewLocation then it is correctly populated.  Why is it that the properties of the UserCurrentAddress are not visible from the buttonClick eventp  pI thought by declaring it in the Activity Class it would be visible throughout.p  pI realise I can probably do what I need to do within the handleNewLocation method, but it would be preferable to have access to those properties from outside that event. p  pI hope Ive managed to explain my issue.p  pCodep  precodepackage com.example.android.trainingapp  import android.content.IntentSender import android.location.Address import android.location.Geocoder import android.location.Location import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity import android.os.Bundle import android.util.Log import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.widget.Button import android.widget.Toast  import com.google.android.gms.common.ConnectionResult import com.google.android.gms.common.api.GoogleApiClient import com.google.android.gms.location.LocationListener import com.google.android.gms.location.LocationRequest import com.google.android.gms.location.LocationServices import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng  import java.io.IOException import java.util.List import java.util.Locale  public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity         implements GoogleApiClient.ConnectionCallbacks,         GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListener,         View.OnClickListener      private GoogleApiClient mGoogleAPIClient     private UserCurrentAddress userCurrentAddress     Button bFindLocation     private LocationRequest mlocationRequest     private final static int CONNECTIONFAILURERESOLUTIONREQUEST  9000      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain          bFindLocation  Button findViewByIdR.id.showlocation         bFindLocation.setOnClickListenerthis          mGoogleAPIClient  new GoogleApiClient.Builderthis                 .addConnectionCallbacksthis                 .addOnConnectionFailedListenerthis                 .addApiLocationServices.API                 .build          mlocationRequest  LocationRequest.create                 .setPriorityLocationRequest.PRIORITYHIGHACCURACY                 .setInterval10  1000                 .setFastestInterval1  1000          userCurrentAddress  new UserCurrentAddressnull, null, null, null, null, 0, 0, null            Override     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu           Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.         getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.menumain, menu         return true           Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item           Handle action bar item clicks here.

Negative 6605 pI found a question that asks the opposite of what Im trying to do here.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2142813addingmethodstothewebservicedooldclientsneedtoupdatewebreferencesAdding methods to the webservice do old clients need to update web referencesap  pBut, basically I have a web service that I inherited and there were originally grand plans but ultimately only a handful of methods were actually being called. Id like to remove to clean up the code some. p  pIt is used only internally and I can verify the only methods being used. The problem is that I cant update the client wsdl at the moment. So if I remove the calls from the web service but the clients wsdl isnt updated does that cause problems p  pKeep in mind I am completely positive these methods arent used as its all internal and we control the programs that use the web service. We can update the wsdl for the clients the next time these programs are updated but that will likely be next year.p
