Positive 742 pSo Ive been trying to learn more about responsive design. Ive started playing about on my computer with a tiny project with a mobile first approach. I scaled my browser down small and styled the layout correctly. Using  for widths and REM for fonts. I thought wow this is easyp  pHowever, when I went to look at my work on an actual mobile the layout positions were fine but every featureelement on the page was showing up tiny. So the navigation menu was coming up really small compared to how it looked in my browser.p  pWhy is this The browser I use is chrome and the mobile android.p

Positive 742 pI am using Indy TCPClientTCPServer to verify registration of a mobile device. The process is fairly straight forward where I read an identifier on the Server Side, validate it against the database control file and send back a response to the client.p  pEverything appears to work correctly for the most part but periodically I get the EIDConnClosedGracefully Exception on the Server Side. I cant seem to pinpoint exactly where the connection is being closed improperly. In fact, it appears that the Server is executing a readln when it is not supposed to after the Connection is closed and I do not know why. Possibly I am not synchronizing properly. I have the Indy Silent Exceptions set to ignore in my ToolsOptionsDebugger Options but I would like to know what is throwing the exception.

Negative 742 pIm beginning to wonder if I am in fact too dumb to use NHibernate.  Im currently using FluentNHibernate to create simple db mappings and thats worked well for us.  When dealing w our various classes in isolation, were able to read and write, perform updates, etc. to all of those classes.

This is sort of awkward and its difficult to be systematic about it, though I guess I could code up a function to search through all of the loaded dictionaries for a reference to that function, watching out for circular references.  Although to be really thorough, it would have to search not only scriptlocal and global dictionaries, but bufferlocal dictionaries as well is there a way to access another buffers local variablesp  pAnyway Im wondering if its possible to dump the source code for the anonymous function instead.

Negative 742 pHey guys, I kind of wanted to ask an opinion based question to start off with. Im going to be picking up an eCommerce project in a month or two so Ive been trying to decide which PHP framework, if any at all, I should go with. What does everyone recommend p  pCurrently, Ive been working through some Magento tutorials. One of the things that I have found that needs to be different is the backend. From what I can tell, when the admin logs into the backend, they have a lot of site customization options available such as turning modules on and off. Is there a way to disable features for the backend Theres just some things I dont want the client to be able to do.p
Negative 742 pI am unable to understand or grasp rather what it means to program at a lower layer in socket programming. I am used to working with tcpudpfile system sockets.

Negative 742 pI have a WCF ASP.Net 4.0 web service well call WebService. WebService is consuming a class library assembly well call WebServiceClassLibrary. WebServiceClassLibrary is referencing another class library assembly ExternalClassLibrary. ExternalClassLibrary is built to use a configuration file. It uses this file to learn where it is to be sending some HTTP posts at runtime. Im having a problem where no matter where I seem to put the configuration section for ExternalClassLibrary it seems to be using the default configuration a behavior I have come to expect when it cannot find a config file at runtime.p  pI expect this means that when .Net is attempting to find the configuration for ExternalClassLibrary it is unable to do so and uses the configuration information found in the compiled assembly. I have attempted to override this configuration by placing a configuration section in the web.config file for WebService, by creating a config file for ExternalClassLibrary and by creating a config file for WebServiceClassLibrary. Even if I attempt to override the configuration in each of these places it still ends up using the default configuration. I am hosting the site in IIS 7.p  pCan someone please tell me how I can determine where I need to place this overriding configuration information I have tried to use SysInternals Process Monitor to see file system read attempts that fail but it only shows two possible places to override the configuration and neither of them did the trick.p  pAppreciate it p  p UPDATE, Here is the contents of the XML file I am trying to load p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt ltconfigurationgt     ltconfigSectionsgt         ltsectionGroup nameapplicationSettings typeSystem.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsGroup, System, Version2.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb77a5c561934e089 gt             ltsection nameMyAppName.Properties.Settings typeSystem.Configuration.ClientSettingsSection, System, Version2.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb77a5c561934e089 requirePermissionfalse gt         ltsectionGroupgt     ltconfigSectionsgt     ltapplicationSettingsgt         ltMyAppName.Properties.Settingsgt             ltsetting nameAPIURL serializeAsStringgt                 ltvaluegthttpservernamedefault.htmlltvaluegt             ltsettinggt             ltsetting nameAPIAPPINI serializeAsStringgt                 ltvaluegtapp.iniltvaluegt             ltsettinggt             ltsetting nameApiUrlRoot serializeAsStringgt                 ltvaluegthttpswww.domain.comcompany[instance]testindex.htmltvaluegt             ltsettinggt             ltsetting nameApiInstances serializeAsXmlgt                 ltvaluegt                     ltArrayOfString xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance                         xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt                         ltstringgtusaltstringgt                         ltstringgteultstringgt                         ltstringgtasialtstringgt                         ltstringgtlatltstringgt                         ltstringgtjpnltstringgt                     ltArrayOfStringgt                 ltvaluegt             ltsettinggt             ltsetting nameApiKey serializeAsStringgt                 ltvaluegtpasswordltvaluegt             ltsettinggt             ltsetting nameApiUrlRoot serializeAsStringgt                 ltvaluegthttpsite[instance].domain.comltvaluegt             ltsettinggt             ltsetting nameProductId serializeAsStringgt                 ltvaluegt12345ltvaluegt             ltsettinggt         ltMyAppName.Properties.Settingsgt     ltapplicationSettingsgt ltconfigurationgt codepre

Negative 742 plately a requirement came up to outsource the database settings out of Spring applicationContext.xml.

Where does the SQL belongp  pa. In every professional project I have worked on, security of the data has been a key requirement. Stored Procedures provide a natural gateway for controlling access and auditing.p  pb. Issues with Applications in production can often be resolved between the tables and stored procedures without putting out new builds.p  p2. How do I control the SQL that is generated I am trusting parse trees to generate efficient SQL. I have quite a bit of experience optimizing SQL in SQLServer and Oracle, but would not feel cheated if I never had to do it again. p  p3. What is the point of using an ORMapper if I am getting my data from stored proceduresp  pI have used the repository pattern with a homegrown generic data access layer.  If a collection needed to be cached, I cache it. I also have experience using EF on a small CRUD application and experience helping tuning an NHibernate application that was experiencing performance issues. So I am a little biased, but willing to learn.p  pFor the past several years we have all been hearing a lot of respectable developers advocating the use of specific ORMappers EntityFramework, NHibernate, etc.... p  pCan anyone tell me why someone should move to an ORM for mainstream development on a major project p  pedit a hrefhttpwww.codinghorror.comblog200606objectrelationalmappingisthevietnamofcomputerscience.html relnofollowhttpwww.codinghorror.comblog200606objectrelationalmappingisthevietnamofcomputerscience.htmla seems to have a strong discussion on this topic but it is out of date.p  pYet another edit Everyone seems to agree that Stored Procedures are to be used for heavyduty enterprise applications, due to their performance advantage and their ability to add programming logic nearer to the data.p  pI am seeing that the strongest argument in favor of OR mappers is developer productivity.p  pI suspect a large motivator for the ORM movement is developer preference towards remaining persistenceagnostic dont care if the data is in memory [unless caching] or on the database. p  pORMs seem to be outstanding timesavers for local and small web applications.p  pMaybe the best advice I am seeing is from client09 to use an ORM setup, but use Stored Procedures for the database intensive stuff AKA when the ORM appears to be insufficient.p

So I exit and run it again as the default user name it gives me and I get a permission error.p  pWhen I try to be root and createuser or do psql it says I need to give a password. I have tried to just hit return, and a bunch of other passwords that it may be. No luck. I thought since I was root I should be good. p  pI know postgresql is there because MT says it is. p  pSo I need to either come up with a psql Password or be able to login as a different user with the ability to restart postgresql.p

Negative 742 pGood day,p  pI have a ASP.net MVC app that needs to upload files to Amazon S3 with progress. I found a neat control called Flajaxian that does the job pretty well. The issue is that now I want to insert a row of data into a DB that keeps track of the uploads. If you look at the code below the control has a FileUploader1ConfirmUpload event that fires after the upload has completed. Url.ActionUpload, TracksController does not do what I want it to, which is fire the Upload Action in the TrackController Controller. This is the first time Ive worked with MVC so Im hoping there is a simple solution.p  pI originally had a submit button to perform the upload in code like this codeltdiv classsubmitBtnDivgtltinput typesubmit valueSubmit classsubmitBtn idtrackAdd gtltdivgtcode. but now the upload is asynchronous so i want to do the same postbackp  pThank you to everyone that takes the time to read through this, and even more to those that try to solve it.p  precode ltdiv classcontentsAccgtltform idform2 runatserver stylewidth400pxgt                 ltscript runatservergt                     private void FileUploader1FileNameDeterminingobject sender, FileNameDeterminingEventArgs e                                              e.FileName  SessionWrapper.PersonId.ToString    e.FileName                                      ltscriptgt                 ltscript runatservergt                     private void FileUploader1ConfirmUploadobject sender, ConfirmUploadEventArgs e                                              Url.ActionUpload, TracksController                                                                  ltscriptgt                     ltfjxFileUploader IDFileUploader1 runatservergt                         ltAdaptersgt                             ltfjxDirectAmazonUploader   OnFileNameDeterminingFileUploader1FileNameDetermining OnConfirmUploadFileUploader1ConfirmUpload                                 AccessKeyWebConfigAmazonAccessKey                                  SecretKeyWebConfigAmazonSecretKey                                 BucketNametracksupload gt                         ltAdaptersgt                     ltfjxFileUploadergt          ltformgtltdivgt codepre  pOk, so Ive tried to change my approach a bit from the above yesterday. Instead of trying to fire the Action of the TracksController i want to move that Action code into the ConfirmUpload event. But now I still need to get the values of the textboxes.

Here are the textBoxes. they are on the same page as the code above.p  precode ltlabel forBandNamegtArtistltlabelgt         ltHtml.TextBoxArtists gtltHtml.ValidationMessageArtist,gt         ltdiv classclearfixgt         ltdivgt         ltlabel forSongNamegtSong Title         ltlabelgt           ltHtml.TextBoxSongName gtltHtml.ValidationMessageSongName,gt         ltdiv classclearfixgt         ltdivgt codepre  pIs it possible to pull the values of the textbox and have it sent to the ConfirmUpload event which happens server side If not with server code then maybe JavaScript client sidep  pstrongThe upload control im using is the only one that does excatly what I want, but it is web forms, the site is MVC. So I have a web forms control on a mvc page. I want to use MVC textbox values and pass it to the web forms control for processing.strongp
Negative 742 pWe recently began using TFS to perform our builds, and are happy with the results that were getting from it.  One metric were interested in is code churn.  We build the system every 2 hours, getting code churn metrics between those builds.  We also periodically manually label the system and generate a build that is consumed by our testing team.  Wed like a way to see the churn between labeled build A and labeled build B could be as long as 4, 5 weeks, but cannot figure out how to get TFS to tell us this natively.p  pWe have thought of one approach, but its fairly manual  we can create a branch just for reporting purposes and build off of it, but its not convenient Updates are the simple case, but adds, renames, deletes would have to be dealt with manually.p

Negative 742 pI recently asked a a hrefhttpaskubuntu.comquestions36255whywontsshagentsavemyunencryptedkeyforlaterusequestion on AskUbuntua about getting sshagent to automatically save my passphrase protected key for later reuse without having to reenter the passphrase during bash login nonGUIGnome. I got a nice bash script in response, but unfortunately it is triggered to ask for the passphrase no matter the git operation. I only want to be prompted if they key is not already in sshagent and a remote git operation is being performed.p  pThis is due to the fact that I use codegitps1 [s]code in my bash prompt to display the git branch of the current working directory codepwdcode. So when I ssh into the machine it immediately asks me for the keys passphrase before it can render the bash promptp  pThe current script from a hrefhttpaskubuntu.comquestions36255whywontsshagentsavemyunencryptedkeyforlateruse3630236302the answer to my question on AskUbuntua looks likep  pIn code.bashprofilecodep  precode File .bashprofile   source .profile, if available if [[ r .profile ]] then   . .profile fi   start agent and set environment variables, if needed agentstarted0 if  env  grep q SSHAGENTPID gtdevnull then   echo Starting ssh agent   eval sshagent s   agentstarted1 fi   ssh become a function, adding identity to agent when needed ssh    if  sshadd l gtdevnull 2gt then     sshadd .sshiddsa   fi   usrbinssh   export f ssh   another example git git    if  sshadd l gtdevnull 2gt then     sshadd .sshiddsa   fi   usrbingit   export f git codepre  pSo as you can see the git function is triggered on every git operation.p  pI had thought that git would use codesshcode to make the connection, but it doesnt appear to trigger the codesshcode function in the above script.

Negative 742 pThe basic question is What is the best way to write data from a hierarchical set of objects to a file The highest order parent has 1000s of children all with children DOM style. Trying to traverse the tree and creating one big string which is then written to a file is throwing an outofmemory exception while creating the string.p  pemstrongDetailsemstrong Ive created a set of classes that make up an emHTMLem document.br There was control that I needed that the prepackaged codeHtmlElementcode and codeHtmlDocumentcode didnt give. The emDocument Object Modelem is maintained throughout, with some similar methods and properties and such.br Im using the custom classes to create a very large emHTMLem document. When I say large, I mean on the order of over 2000 printed pages. Its doubtful that they will all be printed, but some will be.p  pMy base codeHTMLElementcode object, from which all other objects are derived, contains an codeOuterHTMLcode property which, as expected, gets the full emHTMLem of the calling object and the emHTMLem of all child elements.br After the code which generates the report runs, I have my emHTMLDocumentem object containing the entire report which needs to be written to a file. Here is where I keep running into problems.p  pIf I call codeOuterHTMLcode on the codeHTMLDocumentcode object, I get an emout of memoryem exception.  Other reports have saved fine, but this is by far the largest report Ive thrown at my codeHTMLElementcode object.

Likep  precodeFile.WriteAllTextFileName, HtmlDoc.OuterHTML codepre  pSo the question is what is a better way to do this p
Negative 742 pHi  The spring control bus resides in one context or am i wrong  A spring integration context would expose and consume services using channels and adaptors. So in a distributed environment what is the best practise to take advantage of integration of spring integration.

In short how to leverage springintegration as an Enterprise service bus and what are the best practises surrounding them.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 742 pHi I am having some problems in my app for the database timeout. Due to some network glitches the query takes more than 45 sec to return the resultset which has about 10,000 rows. Most of the time its fast upto 1112 secs. My app is runs as a scheduled job in the background.p  pThe problem is I need to try three times if i get the timeout exception before writing the error to the error log or exiting. I know i can set the command timeout property to 60 seconds but still i want to try three times before exiting. I have written a method for that but I think there is some flaw in my method. p  pFor now i specifically set the timeout to be 5 seconds as i know well that it takes more than 25 seconds for this stored proc to run. I just want to get that timeout expired exception and write ways to handle it. p  pMy problem is if after 2 times I set the connection timeout to 50 so my method goes and get the correct list but it again goes inside the methodname which i have called inside the catch statement and finally returns nothing.

So Id like to encapsulate all this in a single function and pass in a querystr, queryparams and a success function.p  pProblem I cant do this as this is inside a callback and I cant make the query engine use my success function even if I pass it in via the callback arguments.p  pSo I am thinking can I do a require inside the callback and if so will the functions in the required module be added to the global scope or the callback scope  I am hoping the latterBp

Negative 742 pWell, I have a view controller that will control all subviews for my app I hope.  When codeinitWithNibNamecode is called, the first view is displayed fine.  When I press a button in that view it calls code IBActionpauseidsendercode.  In this I have codeself.view  pauseViewcode, codepauseViewcode being a codeUIViewcode defined with codeIBOutletcode.  When that codeUIViewcode is displayed, it is displayed with Portrait Orientation, even though the resizing function in the view controller is defined correctly and the iphone simulator is rotated the right way and also the orientation is portrait in Interface Builder.  In other words, everything is sideways from the users perspective.  How do I fix thisp

Negative 742 pFor my project I needed to create a custom terminallike window and connect to a Cisco router through console port. So I inherited a TextBox and created a custom control in WPF. And I thought it would be enough just to add some code to implement extra features I wanted. Im sending one character at a time and wait for responses. But then I saw that my custom terminal does not handle special characters, those basic like n sure are recognized but all the others not. I have written responses to a text file and I see i got quite a lot of those special ones but I dont know how should I react. Maybe someone knows or have found some links with info about how to react for a specific control character I have only found what characters are send a hrefhttpwww.cisco.comenUSdocsios110accessconnectionguidexapascii.html relnofollowherea , but nothing else about it. I understand that for a BS I will delete one character before carriage but what should I do when I get ACK or DC1  Maybe I should just skip them  Any ideasp  hr  pEdit Apart from sending one character at a time Ill get response only when I send enter or characters like  or TAB. Then when I receive a response its mixed with special chars to format the text like in 80x25 terminal window. And I would like just to display it like it wants, but that means I need to know how to react when I get special chars I dont need to display them, just to format normal text based on the special ones Im also receiving. When I get BS i need to clear the character before carriage, when I get DEL I need to clear the character after carriage. And I would like to know what I need to do when Im getting other special chars. I know I can do it the hard way and just send those to a working terminal and see what it will do but it will take a while so I wonder if someone maybe knows the answer.p

Negative 742 pI have been using RubyMine for about 2 months now and been experiencing performance issues ever since. I thought it was because of the buggy debugger, then because of swapping.. Nayp  pSo I realized that for 5  10 minutes it works fine, until RubyMine or Ubuntu decides to use alternatively one core at 100  and the other not so much. It sometimes goes back to normal but tipically stays the same, makin it really unpleasant to use.p  pSo here you see the change around 30 sec.p  pWhat do you think img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR8Uec.png altclear change in cpu usage at 30 secsp

Negative 742 pIs there a method to colorize the output of codecatcode, the way codegrepcode does.p  pFor codegrepcode, in most consoles it displays a colored output highlighting the searched keywords. Otherwise, you can force it by calling codegrep colorcode Is there a generic way to color the output of any program according to your personal choice.p  pFrom what I understand, the program itself is not responsible for the colors. It is the shell. p  pI am using the default shell in FreeBSD 5.2.1 which looks like it has never seen colors since epoch.p

Negative 742 pI have an ASP.Net app .Net 4, C, web forms, pointed to a production SQL box that runs beautifully in Visual Studio, but when loaded onto an IIS Server hosted on the same Windows 7 box, it refuses to load a second session variable.

Using ASP.Nets login controls is not really feasible.p  pThe problem is I cannot debug this on the production server, but since it works in Visual Studio, debug will not reveal anything.

The data will be used with an imposition software and I need to be able to split and join rows to make duplicates.p  pThe data comes in from my service layer as a generic collection called CheckOrderLine that contains 20 objects containing all the data pulled.p  pIm looking for a way to take the current CheckOrderLine from my Binding Source, bs, and make a new CheckOrderLine with all of the same values. I believe this is known as a deep copy.p  pIve learned that I can use the following code to achieve my goal, but Im sure theres a better way to do itp  precode    CheckOrderLine current  CheckOrderLinebs.Current     CheckOrderLine cloned  new CheckOrderLine      cloned.OrderNumber  current.OrderNumber     cloned.Qty  current.Qty codepre  pand so on.p  pstrongSo I guess my question is thisstrong Is there a way to iterate through the CheckOrderLine and set the values for each property in my new object Also, is there something horribly wrong with the direction Im headed Ive seen things around the Web talking about using ICloneable in my CheckOrderLine class, but thats way over my head at this point.p  pstrongEDITstrong Had the wrong VS tag.

Negative 742 pIm new in the chrome extension development, and I wanted to make a extension. That extension has to inject code in a web page when the user clicks a button on the popuppage.

For example a variable called test is made when the user opens a web page, I want to get that variable and use it in my code for example alerttest. I tried several ways to achieve this, but it wont work. How can I do this I tried chrome.tabs.executeScriptnull,codealerttest , console.logalerttest  this worked, but only for the popup page and so the variable test didnt exist.p

Negative 742 pWhen I was experimenting with C and WCF one of the things I kept reading about was how unscalable it is to have clients with a constant current connection to the server. And although WCF allows that it seems that the recommended best practise is to use per call as opposed to per session for instance management if you want to have any kind of decent scalablity. Please correct me if Im wrongp  pHowever from what I understand IRC uses constant client connections to the server and IRC servers well networks of servers are servicing hundreds of thousands of clients at any given time. So in that case is there nothing actually bad about keeping constant client connections to the serverp

Negative 742 pShould I always check if code[[NSArray alloc] init]code or with any other collection class returns codenilcode The Apple docs say that objects may return codenilcode if allocation or initialisation fails.

Negative 742 pI have an EditText in which I want to be able to detect when the user types in a flagged word. When this word is detected, a button becomes visible and the user has more options. I have been able to do this with a TextWatcher. The problem is that Im storing the flagged word that is used in an array every time it is detected by the Textwatcher. But once the word is in the EditText, every character that is entered afterward causes the flagged word to be entered into the array again since the flagged word is still in the EditText.

Negative 742 pUsing Jackson, how can I have JSON serializeddeserialized by one application using one set of classes, but have another application deserialize the same JSON and load different implementations of those classesp  pI have a Spring MVC web application that allows users to define steps in a script, that in turn will be executed in a client application. Steps might be things like codeShowDialogStepcode, with properties like codedialogTextcode, or codeWaitStepcode with a property of codedurationcode.p  pThe client application will load collections of steps from the server. However, the classes instantiated by the client need to have executionspecific functionality like codeexecutecode, which in the case of codeWaitStepcode will keep a track of how far through waiting it is. Clearly the serverside application never needs know about this, and in less trivial examples the executeupdate logic of a steps involves all manner of clientspecific dependencies.p  pSo, to recap I needp  ul liThe server application to map the prototype classes to JSONli liThe client application to read the emsameem JSON but instantiate executionspecific classes instead of the prototype ones.li ul  pWould this be something that could be configured on the clientside mapper, perhaps if the JSON was serialized using relative class names rather than fullyqualified then the deserializer could be configured to look in a different package for the implementations with execution logic in themp

Negative 742 pThe company I work for gave me the project of moving their java project from CVS to Git. For several reasons, they dont want to use another tool than Eclipse. So were stuck with EGit.p  pI searched a lot to find a workflow adapted to our project. This one seemed quite relevant and used by many people  a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodelhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodelap  pThe problem is that when we tried to see how it could work with EGit using commits, branches amp merges, a lot of fastforward merge happened. The problem with fastforward merges is that it makes you emlooseem the starting point of the branch.p  pThe client we work for wants to be able to choose which features will be in the next release and which will not be. That is one of the main reasons we want to move from CVS to Git, because there seemed to be no easy way in CVS to find which files were modified due to feature 1 and which files were modified for feature 2. In git, we can make branches for feature 1 amp 2 and find which files were modified for these features. But, due to fastforward, it is like going back to CVS, we are not able to know which is feature1 and which is feature 2.p  pstrongSo is there any way to prevent fast foward merge strong We tried to put these configurations in Eclipse  p  precode[core] mergeoptions  noff  [merge] ff  false codepre  pBut it did not prevent EGit from doing fastforward merge. If this feature is not implemented with JGitEGit, would there be any other way to have a workflow using Egit that follows what the client want ability to choose features for release. Using the command line would probably solve the problem, but if it is possible to keep it in Eclipse, that would be nice.p  pThank youp

Negative 742 pI have a 2D grid of views Ill call them tiles on the screen. Each tile has a subview which I am rotating around the Y axis in an animation block. I have set sublayerTransform properly on each tile. All the subviews which I am rotating do exhibit 3D perspective. The problem is the vanishing point for each one is the center of the tile instead of the center of the screen, disrupting the illusion of 3D. When I set sublayerTransform on the parent of all the tiles, the rotating views do not exhibit any perspective. I believe this is because sublayerTransform only applies to the children of a layer and not too grandchildren. How do I make all rotating views use the same vanishing point Ive included a poorly drawn image to help illustrate the point. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQckAV.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 742 pWe are all aware of the increase in screen resolution in the new iPhone 5. On the other hand, the new iPhone 5 will take some time to become popular in the market. If I have an app that I am about to submit to the Apple a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAppStore28iOS29 relnofollowAppnbspStorea, and I didnt take any consideration for the new resolution in iPhone 5, will Apple accept itp  pI am not saying that I will never take the new resolution into consideration, but I mean that since I worked on the app for a long time, and since the new iPhone will not be in widespread usage very soon, I might submit the app now and submit an update later in the coming months that takes the new resolution into consideration.p  hr  h3Updateh3  pMy app was approved by Apple.p  pI would like to inform you that the app that I submitted after the launch of iPhone 5 was accepted by Apple although it didnt have any iPhone 5 resolution considerations in it, so the answer below is 100 correct.p
Negative 742 pI have this issue for a while and I want to know if it is just me or it is the way chrome works. When I make changes to an image and upload it, on reload chrome fails to show the new image, instead it shows the old image. Firefox shows the new image. This happens mostly with big images, like background. So I have to wait for a few minutes before chrome shows the new image... Is this a rule or it happens just with my browserp

Negative 742 pI was programming node.js in the last days and heavily used the async a hrefhttpsgithub.comcaolanasync relnofollowlibrarya.

There are functions which run asynchronous calls in parallel or after another and call a single callback after all functions are finished or an error occured.p  pAre there any librarys like this for Cp  pI really like asynchronous programming, but the huge amount of callbacks all of them with error handling etc are really hard to read and maintain and are kind of ugly.

Negative 742 pAlright, here is my situation. I have a JavaScript class that deals with AJAX form submissions and other related synchronous and asynchronous requests.

Negative 742 pI have a JSF 2 app that uses RichFaces 4 and Spring Security 3.1 running on Tomcat 6 also tested on Tomcat 7. Spring Security handles the session timeout and redirects user to the login page. That works perfectly.p  pThe problem is that AJAX calls dont seen to have the effect of extending the session lifetime the say that ordinary navigation calls do.p  pIve read other articles suggesting that AJAX calls dont behave the same as ordinary navigation calls and that this is why the session isnt extended unfortunately, none of them provide a clear explanation as to why this is. This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4525171preventingsessiontimeoutduringlongprocessingtimeinjsfthreada suggests that a call to codegetSessioncode will do the trick. However, this is not working for me.p  pInstead of writing my own jquery poller I used the PrimeFaces idlemonitor as suggested a hrefhttpmurygin.wordpress.com20121129jsfprimefacessessiontimeouthandling relnofollowherea. The bean method called by the idle monitor reset calls codegetSessioncode.  For testing I set the session timeout period to 4 minutes. Even though the AJAX method with getSession is being called after two minutes the session still expires exactly 4 minutes after I navigate to that page.p  pAny idea what Im doing wrong More importantly, how would you debug this situationp  pThanksp

Negative 742 pI have a custom Object that has some counter fields. This Object gets those fields incremented within a function that will be called recursively. So I need the Object to be created anew each time the function is called so that the counter fields are reset, but not created anew if the function is in a recursive call. Make sensep  pCurrently, Im doing this by overloading the method so that its not emtrueem recursion, but rather Im passing the same Object with counters around so that my counts are persisted.p  pBasically, something like below is what Im doing nowp  precodestatic Counter countObject parent       Counter newCounter  new Counter     newCounter  countparent, newCounter      return newCounter   static Counter countObject parent, Counter currentCounter       Object cur  new Objectparent      ifcur.isChild         Counter.child     else ifcur.isParent              Counter.parent         countcur, currentCounter           return currentCounter  codepre  pIs there a better way to do this Or a way where I dont need the overloading Oh, and I emdoem need the main method to stay static, due to restraints I cant easily change elsewhere within the system.p

Negative 742 pA bit about environment we do UI build automation with a hrefhttpgruntjs.com relnofollowGrunta, we do use a hrefhttptwitter.github.combower relnofollowTwitter Bowera for managing thirdparty dependencies, as we dont want to keep thirdparty code in our repository, we use a hrefhttpcompassstyle.org relnofollowCompassa for CSS extension.p  pCurrently making a compressed version of vendor assets into single CSS file and encountered a problem, that Compass doesnt transform somehow images to inline ones while build. We want all images to be inlined into resulting CSS file with Data URL as long as we support browsers newer than IE9 . p  pMaster SCSS file including a hrefhttpgithub.comjlongsasstwitterbootstrap relnofollowBootstrap SASSa looks likep  precode stylesmain.scss iconSpritePath      ..componentsbootstrapsassimgglyphiconshalflings.png iconWhiteSpritePath ..componentsbootstrapsassimgglyphiconshalflingswhite.png .. import ..componentsbootstrapsasslibbootstrap codepre  pCompass command looks likep  precodecompass compile cssdir targetcompassstyles     sassdir appstyles imagesdir appimages outputstyle expanded codepre  pResulting output is likep  precode targetcompassstylesmain.css  line 18, ......appcomponentsbootstrapsasslibsprites.scss  [classicon], [class icon]    display inlineblock   ...    WANT THIS IMAGE INLINED    backgroundimage url..componentsbootstrapsassimgglyphiconshalflings.png   ...  codepre  pSo, main desire is to get all codeurlcode expressions to hold base64 encoded images inline. As an alternative, we can switch to LESS, if it provides this ability more easily. Actually, a good thing, because wed eliminate dependency on RubyCompass and wed be able to install everything with NPMp
Negative 742 pI have been using WeakEventManager to avoid memory leaks, and i started to overuse them. I created extension methods for example for the INotifyPropertyChanged likep  precode public static void AddWeakPropertyChangedthis INotifyPropertyChanged item, Action handler      PropertyChangedEventManager.AddHandleritem, s, e  handlere.PropertyName, string.Empty  codepre  pNow i quickly realized, that this doesnt work. In fact, you cant really use anonymous methods for weak event handling. If i understand correctly, then the compiler creates a closure class for it to hold referenced values, which has the handler, but since your closure class is not referenced anywhere, the GC will clear it away, and the event handler will not be calledp  pQuestion 1 Is that correct I mean is it correct, then when using an anonymous method or lambda for a weak event handler, the handler is called only if the GC did not run in the meanwhile e.g. it is undeterministicp  pWell, i thaught so, so i did some unit tests to make sure i get it right. It seemed allright until i hit the following unit testp  precode         class DidRun                      public bool Value  get set                   class TestEventPublisher                      public event EventHandlerltEventArgsgt MyEvent             public void RaiseMyEvent                              if MyEvent  null                     MyEventthis, EventArgs.Empty                                class TestClosure                      public DidRun didRun  get set              public EventHandlerltEventArgsgt Handler  get private set              public TestClosure                              this.Handler  new EventHandlerltEventArgsgts, e  didRun.Value  true                               [TestMethod]         public void TestWeakReference                      var raiser  new TestEventPublisher             var didrun  new DidRun             var closure  new TestClosure  didRun  didrun              WeakEventManagerltTestEventPublisher, EventArgsgt.AddHandlerraiser, MyEvent, closure.Handler             closure  null              GC.Collect             GC.Collect             raiser.RaiseMyEvent             Assert.AreEqualfalse, didrun.Value           codepre  pQuestion 2 Can anyone explain my why does this test failp  pExpectation Here i do not have any closures i took them out, to make sure what is happening, i simply have an object closure, that subscribes to an event with the WeakEventManager, and then i drop the reference to it closure  null.p  pI was expecting the 2 GC.Collect calls, to clean up my old closure class, so the WeakEventManager would drop the subscriber, and not run the handler, but the test fails. Any ideasp  pEDIT Sorry, the generic arguments were not visible, now they arep

Negative 742 pHeres the scenario. I have some JavaScript code that would be generated on the fly. So, instead of using the codepromptcode which opens up an inputbox for reading userinput, I made a custom element. Because I can style my custom inputbox rather than using the normal one.p  pSo, the function to show the custom inputbox is something like, codeshowinputcodep  pAnd this code generated on the fly, is executed at the end using codeevalcode. So in code, after calling that codeshowinputcode function, the program is supposed to wait until the user enters the value and presses the buttonthe button in my custom made input form. And there would be more than one calls to this function in the generated code.p  pI am not sure how to find a solution to this. That is, to make it behave just like the codepromptcode halting the entire execution of the code.p  pWhat I have tried is, using a boolean flag which would be set when user enter the value and presses the button, in our custom input box. So, when my codeshowinputcode is called, it would show the custom input box and then enters into an infinite loop which would halt only when this boolean flag in set. But this freezes the webpage making it not responding. So, thats not a great solution.p  pIs there any way to mimic the functionality of how the codepromptcode function works. I mean, pause the entire page until the user presses the buttonp  pcodesetTimeoutcode function wouldnt be a good choice in my case. Because the reason is, my code generated would look something like thisp  precodestatement1 statement2  showinput call the function to show my custom inputbox  statement3  showinput  statement4 statement5  etc... codepre  pSo, after codestatement2code, the function call is for displaying the custom input box asking the user to enter the value and press a button. Only after pressing this button, it should goto codestatement3code. Till that time, it should wait for the user to press the button in my custom input box.p  pI am using jQuery and the button had a click event added to it.p  pThe above code generated at runtime, is executed using codeevalcodep  pAny ideas would be highly appreciated. Thank youp

annotation on methods and it see that strongA method annoted using Transactional must have transactional semanticsstrong but what it means with transactional semanticsp  pIt means that the methos execution has to be considered as the execution of a transaction So it means that the method operations have to be considered as a single operation that which may lead to a success or a failure, if successful, the results of operations has to be permanent, whereas in case of failure to return to the state prior to the start of the transaction.p  pIs this the meaning of use strongTransactionalstrong annotation on a methodp  pAnd what exactly mean the strongreadOnly  falsestrong attribute in the Transactional annotation of the strongaddPersonstrong method it mean that I can also write a record in the database and not only read it or what The doubt is related because I have understand that, by default, a transaction definied using Transactional annotaion is strongreadwritestrong and not just read... I have also try to delete the strongreadOnly  falsestrong attribute and still work well insert the new record in the database tablep  pThe following dout is why some method are annoted using Transactional annotation and some other methods not is it a good pratcice to annote ALL CRUD method withd Transactionalp  pTnxp  pAndreap

Negative 742 pEDIT The problem is now that even though start is called, a hrefhttpsgithub.comttiuranineo4juuidblobmastersrcmainjavaorgneo4jextensionuuidUUIDTransactionEventHandler.java relnofollowhttpsgithub.comttiuranineo4juuidblobmastersrcmainjavaorgneo4jextensionuuidUUIDTransactionEventHandler.javaa is activated only for an empty database of version 2.0.0M03 in 1.9.2 it is never called, and in there data.createdNodes returns an empty iterator, even though a node was created.

Negative 742 pI have a modal window that has a lot of new dynamic elements inputs, buttons, etc..

Negative 742 pstrongThe Planstrongp  pThe plan Ive got is to use JQUERY to retrieve input from three fields inside the view. Then use AJAX to send that input to the controller, which in turn sends that data the model. To be used to retrieve data, send the result back to the .js file and then amend a table to display the data inside the view.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pLooking through my code, it doesnt look like the data isnt being sent from the .js file to the controller. I think this because the data from the database isnt being displayed inside the amended table.

Negative 742 pI have a Mac OS X application with IAP. The IAP items are consumable and large quantities of them may be used in a very short time, not at once, but in small pieces. So, basically it is not practical for me to save the consumption of these items on my server, because if I do so, my app needs to communicate with the server almost constantly, just to update the consumption of the item in small bits. p  pI have managed to store this consumable item data on a file locally located in users app container folder. I also have used some kind of encryption, so that user cant easily add quantities to the item. p  pMy question is Is this method reliable My biggest concern is that user make a purchase, and then somehow the data that I have saved locally be destroyed this lost item can never be retrieved. Does the data in the apps container folder get lost when user uninstalls or updates my appp  pOn the other hand, I can not save purchases on my server and restore them if user lost the file, because I can never know which quantities of the item have been used by the user since its purchase.p

Negative 742 plinux x8664, gcc, ipv4.p  phere is how I understand finding out who my IPv4 client is.  first, I start with a client handle, that is not a pointer but an integer huh.  then, I need to allocate space for a destination sockaddr structure, and allocate space for an unsigned int to hold its length passed as a reference.  then I call getsockname with the integer client handle and my destination sockaddress and sockaddress length.  internally, presumably getsockname copies the kernels IP representation and other info into my own sockaddr.  then I need to call ntoa with the sockaddr structure to get a string.  and finally, I need to convert this string into an integer.  there is also both getpeername and getsockname.p  pthese are the examples that I have seen.  this seems portable but inefficient for a server where latency is important.  but lets say I want to stay inside linux on the x8664 architecture and IPv4.  I would guess that the kernel internals already store an IP number as an int somewhere, so that most roundtrip calls here are not necessary, so that the IPv4 could be looked up directly and a lot faster without intermediate storage.  does such a function exist  I looked for a long time, but could not find it.p  pit would make a lot of sense if the getsockname function had an alternative that simply returned an IP representation as a single integer.  this would also save the time and overhead of having to make a copy.  does this exist  PS incidentally, if it did exist, it would be logical to have an ntoalike call that mapped this uniqueperIP int to the standard xx.xx.xx.xx string, i.e., obviating the need for the intermediate sockaddress.p  pif such a function does not exist, at the very least, I should be able to avoid the ntoa to string and back to integer conversion.  this means I would have to know which or even whether of the bytes in the sockaddr structure represent the IP, so I could cast these bytes into a 4byte C integer.

Negative 742 pI am building an app for IOS and I want to use NodeJS on my server side. The server should handle requests with parameters to modify or get data from a mongodb database. I would like some advise  regarding the means to do this. Should I use Socket.io or express routing is good enoughp  pI started using express routing since this should be kind of restful. I build URLs with method and its parameters on the client side and route and get parameters inside each handler method on the server side.

Negative 742 pI am fairly new to SVN  I have access to a repository where the trunk contains some userdefined libraries.

That being the case, I want this program to run on my gpu.  As it is now, it does not take advantage of parallel processing  which obviously defeats the whole purpose of writing the program in cuda. However, Im not sure how to remove the recursive nature of the program in addition to delegating the threads to a specific index or starting point. p  pAny constructive input is appreciated.p  pAlso, I get an occasional warning message on successive compiles meaning it sporadically appears codewarning  Stack size for entry function Z8lengthdi cannot be statically determinedcode.p  pI havent pinpointed the problem yet, but I figured I would post it in case anyone identified the cause before I can. It is being compiled in visual studio 2012.   p  pNote I found this to be fairly interesting. As the cuda program is now, its output to the console is periodic  meaning that it prints a few dozen combinations, pauses, prints a few dozen combinations, pauses, and so forth. I also observe this behavior in its reported gpu usage  it periodically swings from 5 to 100.p

Negative 742 pWe were having a discussion today, with the subject being our data storage solution we use, being NHibernate. In the team, we have a strong opponent of this storage solution, as we have often, in his words lose time debugging things related to proxies and backward compatibility.p  pThe application in which we use NHibernate is a 1D hydraulic simulation suite for simulating water flow in rivers, water quality, dealing with rainfall and working with both static and dynamically triggered hydraulic structures. The user defines a graphs that represents the river network, places structures on these graphs and parameterize them, defines initial conditions initial water levels, pollutant level etc and driving data rainfall, evaporation, chemical processes, etc. We deal with tabulated input data, both big and small, and GIS data, and off course the various real world abstraction objects like bridges, lakes, local water discharge locations and many more. Were continuously improving and extending the product and weve got already 3 releases out that we have to support, so backwards compatibility is an important factor. p  pNow Ill have to admit, Im not a databaseguy. I have very limited knowledge on the various storage solutions that exist and their pros and cons. If it would be up to the afore mentioned colleague, our data store should be refactored to a flatfiles based solution storage, using XML files for example. While I dont think this product is going to get such a refactoring, it might be that our next product might go for a full flatfile based storage solutionp  pI was just wondering, given the above general description, what would be the pros and cons for either taking the flatfile based storage route compared to using NHibernate or any comparative solution. Does my colleague have a good point and flatfiles actually a superior data storage solution for this case Or is he just very biased and might the main problem just be an insufficient understanding of how NHibernate worksp

Negative 742 pVisual Studio 2012 seems to occasionally completely reorganise the HTML tables in my aspx pages.

Negative 742 pI have a Win32 OpenGL control that I need to embed in our WPF application. It must respond to, and propogate, mouse and keyboard events.p  pIve created a HwndHost derived instance to host the native window and have overridden the WndProc function in this class. To propogate win32 messages to WPF I handle specific mouse messages and map them to WPF events, then use the static InputManager class to raise them. p  pstrongThe problem is, when I go to handle them the mouse coordinates are messed up.strongp  pHeres a sample of the code Im using to raise the eventsp  precodeIntPtr MyHwndHostWndProcIntPtr hwnd, int msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, bool handled    switch msg        case WMLBUTTONDOWN              MouseButtonEventArgs eventArgs  gcnew MouseButtonEventArgs           MousePrimaryDevice,           EnvironmentTickCount,           MouseButtonLeft          eventArgsgtRoutedEvent  UIElementPreviewMouseDownEvent         eventArgsgtSource  this           Raise the WPF event from the specified WPF event source.

Keyboard support worked out of the box, its just the mouse location support that I cant get working correctly.p

Negative 742 pIm trying to allow a simple PHP form to create a backup of a database.  Based off my research thus far the best approach is using PHPs exec function.  When I run my PHP script, it is running under user codeapachecode and the exec functions second and third parameters return and empty array and code1code, respectively.p  pWhen I log in to my AWS EC2 instance and copypaste the command as it was passed to the exec function it executes just fine  The only difference I can tell is that Im logged in as user codeec2usercode instead of apache.  I started messing around with the codeetcsudoerscode file, but all that did was break my svnpostcommithookupdateproject script which Id created by following a hrefhttpbrennydoogles.wordpress.com20111021usingsubversiontoautomaticallypublishyourwebsite relnofollowthis tutoriala.p  pFor reference, here are the two databasecopy attempts Ive made, using PHP and the exec functionp  precode method 1 command  usrbinsudo usrbinmysqldump u .getDBUsername. password .getDBDatabase.  mysql u .getDBUsername. password newdb output  array return  null output  execcommand, output, return vardumpoutput codepre  pThe second try I hav emade is piping the mysqldump to a .sql file then reading it back in, but the .sql file never gets populated though it will be created.p  precode method 2 dumpcommand  sudo mysqldump u .getDBUsername. password.getDBDatabase. gt .temp.sql output  null returnvar  null execdumpcommand, output, returnvar vardumpoutput execsudo mysql newdb u .getDBUsername. p.getDBPassword. lt .temp.sql codepre  pstrongNotesstrong p  ol licodepasswordcode does contain the codepcode tag if the password is set and yes, without a space between it and the password.li liI have attempted giving the directory where the file is created or the .php script which contains either of these exec commands to apache with the codechowncode command, but it hasnt made a difference.li ol  pAny suggestions on what to try  I suspect simply giving user codeapachecode the permissions that codeec2usercode has would suffice, but havent figured out how to do that, and again, my edits to codeetcsudoerscode has only broken things thus far.p

The only time I get this situation error is nil, and success is NO, is when I call codemyAFNetworkingClient searchForQuerycode many times in a forloop to update  a bunch of entries with new ones from the database, and for every call a different localContext ismay be used, right. So, when the xml is parsed, and Entities are created, this happens with different contexts. Now, what if two xml files both contain an element lets say a person that is the same for two entries If one parser already has created an codeEntitycode for codePersoncode, and then the second parser also needs to do that amoment later, will that cause a conflict, because codePersoncode already exists Am I on the right track here And if so, is there a way around thisp

Negative 742 pIm currently experimenting with Msgpack to deserialize an object graph using Msgpack but I am hitting problems.p  pAt the moment I have a simple hierachy consisting of two classes codeBaseMessagecode and codePersonNewcode. codeBaseMessagecode has a single Long field codeidcode with getters and setters. codePersonNewcode has String fields codenamecode and codeemailcode and inherits from codeBaseMessagecode.p  pOriginally codePersonOldcode class had the codeidcode field and it serializeddeserialized fine. However when tring to deserialize from codePersonOldcode which had the codeidcode to codePersonNewcode class which inherits the codeidcode from codeBaseMessagecode Im being hit with the errorp  precodeorg.msgpack.MessageTypeException Unexpected raw value codepre  pAll the fields Im using are private.p  pBelow is the sample codep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecode    PersonOld personOld  new PersonOld     personOld.setNameperson     personOld.setEmailpersonemail.com      MessagePack msgpack  new MessagePack     msgpack.registerPersonNew.class     msgpack.registerPersonOld.class       Serialize using old person class     byte[] personBytes  msgpack.writepersonOld      ByteArrayInputStream in  new ByteArrayInputStreampersonBytes     Unpacker unpacker  msgpack.createUnpackerin       Deserialize using new person class     PersonNew deserializePerson  unpacker.readPersonNew.class codepre  pThe reason Id like to deserialize to a newer class is because I want to see if its possible to have older serialized data e.g. in a persisted message queue be compatible with newer classes e.g. in case of class updates. I have attempted to even use the codeOptionalcode annotation on the codeidcode of the codeBaseMessagecode class but still doesnt work.p  pIs it possible at all to deserialize with a different class despite having the same fieldsp  pRegards,p  pSNKp
Negative 742 pI know how to program, but i want to become a better programmer. I have certain classes that are more IO oriented. One takes in a url with a macro, some page numbers, and an downloader interface, an some xpath to combine many htmls into one managable xml. p  pThe problem comes in my mind is, do i let the end user access the methods that do the work, or do i make the class have one single run method Or do i leave the class as is, with no run method, and add a method to a utility class that simply constructs the object and returns its ultimate value.p  pmaking a class with a single public method feels wrong, but on the other hand, making a bunch of public methods that could be relied on, and therefore kill my ability to refactor also feels wrong.p

Negative 742 pI am trying to create clickable divs that will set a variable once they are clicked.p  pFor example,p  pIf my program had to do with playing with balls.p  pWhen a user inputs a name, and what kind of ball they want lets say name Johnny and BallBasketBall and then clicks Create a Ball, My program will create a div called Ball0. The Ball0 div will display Johnnys name. When a user Clicks on his name it will say Johnny has a BasketBall.p  pHere is how I am trying to do this codep  precodevar ballRefrence  1  function createBall      ballRefrence 1     var myElement  document.createElementdiv     myElement.id  individualBallballRefrence     ballArea.appendChildmyElementball area is where I want to list the divs     myElement.style.width  550px     myElement.innerHTML userName has bought a ball      createEventListner    function createEventListner      var iBall  document.getElementByIdindividualBallballRefrence     iball.addEventListenerclick,showBall,false    function playCaption      I am not sure how to pull the individual up here.      Since I am using the BallRefrencevariable     it will always be the last person clicked..     Basically I cannot say      alert.ballRefrence  codepre  pI guess what I am trying to say is this,  I have my BallRefrence that goes up by 1 each time. I store all the items in an array. so first person will go to index 0, second will go to index 1...ect I am having problems refrencing the element, because I am not sure how to pull the corrisponding numbe from the div.p  pExample After 3 clicks of create ball my html will look something like this.p  precode    ltdiv id  individualBall0gtltdivgt     ltdiv id  individualBall1gtltdivgt     ltdiv id  individualBall2gtltdivgt codepre  pSince each individual div will match up to the element in the array I want, How will tell my program  When you click individualBall0, I want ball[0].. or when you click indivdualBall2, I want ball[2]p  pI hope this makes more sense. p

Negative 742 pI am using a hrefhttpd3js.org relnofollowd3a to draw a meteor collection Hostiles with x and y coordinates onto an image. I can do this successfully. However, I have a publish function that checks to see if the user login is an admin or just a normal user. If the user is an admin it uses d3 to draw all of the points, but when it is any other user it only draws points specific to the users location.p  precodeBase Publish on User Type if user  true    Admin Return all Points   return Hostiles.find  else    Any other user returns location specific points    return Hostiles.findlatitude lte xLoc  80, gte xLoc  80, longitude lte yLoc  80, gte yLoc  80  codepre  pAll of that works fine. The problem occurs when I change the codexLoccode and codeyLoccode of a codeHostilecode location. When the admin is logged in, the redraw is instantaneous with the change in the collection. However when a normal user is logged in there is a lag in redraw. This d3 redraw usually takes around 310 seconds. On the client I have both my subscription and d3 drawn in an codeMeteor.autorunfunction code. Maybe there isnt any way to get around this problem Thanks.p

Negative 742 pI am writing a small server that will receive data from multiple sources and process this data. The sources and data received is significant, but no more than epoll should be able to handle quite well. However, all received data must be parsed and run through a large number of tests which is time consuming and will block a single thread despite epoll multiplexing. Basically, the pattern should be something like follows IOloop receives data and bundles it into a job, sends to the first thread available in the pool, the bundle is processed by the job and the result is passed pack to the IO loop for writing to file.p  pI have decided to go for a single IO thread and N worker threads. The IO thread for accepting tcp connections and reading data is easy to implement using the example provided at a hrefhttplinux.die.netman7epoll relnofollowhttplinux.die.netman7epollap  pThread are also usually easy enough to deal with, but I am struggling to combine the epoll IO loop with a threadpool in an elegant manner. I am unable to find any best practice for using epoll with a worker pool online either, but quite a few questions regarding the same topic.p  pI therefore have some question I hope someone can help me answeringp  ol liCould and should eventfd be used as a mechanism for 2way synchronization between the IO thread and all the workers For instance, is it a good idea for each worker thread to have its own epoll routine waiting on a shared eventfd with a struct pointer, containing datainfo about the job i.e. using the eventfd as a job queue somehow Also perhaps have another eventfd to pass results back into the IO thread from multiple worker threadsli liAfter the IO thread is signaled about more data on a socket, should the actual recv take place on the IO thread, or should the worker recv the data on their own in order to not block the IO thread while parsing data frames etc. In that case, how can I ensure safety, e.g. in case recv reads 1,5 frames of data in a worker thread and another worker thread receives the last 0,5 frame of data from the same connectionli liIf the worker thread pool is implemented through mutexes and such, will waiting for locks block the IO thread if N1 threads are trying to use the same lockli liAre there any good practice patterns for how to build a worker thread pool around epoll with two way communication i.e. both from IO to workers and backli ol  pEDIT Can one possible solution be to update a ring buffer from the IOloop, after update send the ring buffer index to the workers through a shared pipe for all workers thus giving away control of that index to the first worker that reads the index off the pipe, let the worker own that index until end of processing and then send the index number back into the IOthread through a pipe again, thus giving back control p  pMy application is Linuxonly, so I can use Linuxonly functionality in order to achieve this in the most elegant way possible. Cross platform support is not needed, but performance and thread safety is.p

After creating a socket and codebindcodeing it to my localhost and some port Id like to use codeselectcode to know when an incoming connection arrives to the bound socket. After that the application should print the message up to a certain lenght and then codeexitcode.p  pMy question is basically if I need to use codelistencode and codeacceptcode when Im expecting only one connection please remember this is just for testing. I believe these functions are not needed in this case and are only needed for accepting multiple incoming requests. Am I wrongp  pWith the above ideia in mind I wrote the following codep  precodeint main      int fd  TCPcreateatoh127.0.0.1, 15000 my localhost address     char str  malloc100     int a     fdset rfds      FDZEROamprfds     FDSETfd,amprfds      a  selectfd1,amprfds,fdsetNULL,fdsetNULL,struct timevalNULL    printfselect returns dnfd  dn, a, fd   printffd is set sn, FDISSETfd,amprfds  yes  no      a  TCPrecvfd, str, 100 receive at most 100B     printfdn, a     printfsn, str      closefd     exit0  codepre  pTCPcreatep  precodeint TCPcreateunsigned long IP, unsigned short port      int fd     struct sockaddrin address      fd  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0     iffd1              return 1           memsetampaddress, 0, sizeofaddress     address.sinfamily  AFINET     address.sinaddr.saddr  htonlIP     address.sinport  htonsport       struct sockaddrin is the same size as struct sockaddr      ifbindfd, struct sockaddrampaddress, sizeofaddress1              return 2           return fd  codepre  pcodeatohcode simply returns its argument in host byte order.p  pWhat happens when I run the program is that codeselectcode doesnt block waiting for a connection.

I have both of them stored into 2 separate arrays, but how would I map each integer onto each character After mapping them, how would I go about writing a method of permutationp  pNeither arrays are the same size. The permutation array has 10 values, the char array has less than 400 chars, but I just initialized it as char text[400] the size of each arrays do not move.p  pBetter explanationp  pI was thinking, if I have 10 integers 0  9 and the following permutation  where each permutation cannot have the same numberp  p0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  originalp  p1, 0, 3, 6, 7, 4, 5, 9, 2, 8  permutationp  pApple, bee                    text of 10 characters, including the space and commap  pso by applying the permutation above, I would get something likep  ppAl be,epep  pAnd if you use the inverse of that permutation, you would get Apple, bee again.p  pThe original index[0] is where the A in Apple is supposed to be  and with the permutation, it is switched with the p because of the 1 index... and so on.p  pSo how would I go about implementing that In other words, how would I map the permutation to each char and have it switch positions I havent learned about Structures yet.p

I think I might have had GDAL previously installed with kyngchaos for QGIS use a while ago before I used the brew installp  pAny insights would be much appreciated. I cant imagine I am the only one who has had issues installing fiona, but I havent been able to find a resolution through google searching alone yet.p

Negative 742 pI am trying to write a simple TCP client which sends a request to a remote host using Java codeSocketcode. The application is synchronous, so it will first transmit and receive and will block until the response is received.p  pI am able to create a Socket connection with the remote host and it seems I am able to send the request without a problem, however I never receive a response from the server, and so it ends up hanging.p  pAlso, a look at Wireshark does not seem to indicate any datagram sent or received tofrom the specified host IP I should add that the host is accessed via VPN, which I have verified that I can ping on the command line.

Negative 742 pIll apologize in advance. Im definitely not a JavaEclipseTomcat expert at all. I love the environment once it is working and I can just write code, but getting things set up in the first place... yeah. Thats why Im here.p  pSo Ive been trying for a while to get a Servlet loaded and running within Tomcat from inside Eclipse. There are a ton of tutorials on the web for this, but they all seem to break down at some point I expect a lot of this codetechnology changes over time. In my current state, Tomcat will start cleanly without errors. But when I try to actually access my Servlet via URL, I always 404. I figure there could be a few things going on here.p  ul lipMaybe my Servlet isnt actually being loaded. Im not sure how exactly to tell this. I learned that Tomcat has a manager Servlet which might prove useful, but it looks to me like when you run Tomcat within Eclipse, it copies much of the Tomcat environment, and does not include Servlets like the manager. Is that correct If so, how can I tell if my Servlet is being loaded at allpli lipMaybe my Servlet is loaded and running just fine, and Im hitting the wrong URL. I hope this is the answer, because it will just become a stupid question from a guy who hasnt done muchany work with Servlets before. Per another question asked here, I added this to the web.xml for my Servlet projectp  precodeltservletgt     ltservletnamegtSimpleServletltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtcom.pattyanddave.edu.SimpleServletltservletclassgt ltservletgt  ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtSimpleServletltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtSimpleServletlturlpatterngt ltservletmapping codepre  pWhen I do that, Tomcat fails to start, claiming two different servlets are mapped to that urlpattern. So I figure Eclipse tried to already do this for me, but I cant figure out wherehow it did so. To duck this problem, I changed the urlpattern to SimpleServlet2. Then Tomcat starts fine, but I havent yet found any URL that will actually hit my Servlet.pli ul  pPerhaps related, I note that the Servlet class that Eclipse created for me includes an annotation likep  precodeWebServletSimpleServlet codepre  pprior to the class definition. I guessed this was somehow causing the duplicate binding to the urlpattern, but if I also change emthatem to SimpleServlet2, I dont get the duplicate error upon startup. So I dont know if that annotation is related, or how a pattern put there relates to the patterns in web.xml.p  pSorry if the question isnt clear. My hunch is that something funny is happening in the way Eclipse sets up the Tomcat environment within Eclipse.p

Both are different versions of same schema.p  pThere are minute differences between these two files. i.e Some nodes are same and others are different.p  pFor ex A complex type ABC has qwe, rty properties in one version But in the second version ABC has qwe, mnp, zxc properties.p  pAlso, there are other complex types which are completely same in both versions.p  pNow I do not want to generate two separate classes for these two schemas xsd files using xsd.exe tool.p  pInstead is there any option where only one c class can be maintained for both versions of xsd files p  pI have a field by field mapping of the xsd to other Objects.

Negative 742 pHy Im trying to convert an image both png or jpeg to pdf and then adding crop marks using tcpdf no limitation on the library, it just seemed the best to me, no problems in changing if would solve the problem.  the best case for me is I have an input image, I give it to some function of tcpdf, that converts it into a pdf, add the bookmarks in the angles topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright and save the pdf without nowing anything about the sizes of the image...  I tried looking around but coudnt find anything without passing the size of the images to tcpdf, this is what I came up with p  precodepagelayout  array706, 606   or arrayheight, width  pdf  new TCPDF, pt, pagelayout, true, UTF8, false   set document information pdfgtSetAuthorJOIN SRL  add a page pdfgtAddPage pdfgtImageinput, 0, 0, , , JPG, httpwww.tcpdf.org, , true, 300, , false, false, 1, false, false, false pdfgtImageinput pdfgtcropMark, , 10, 10, TL pdfgtcropMark, , 10, 10, TR pdfgtcropMark, , 10, 10, BL pdfgtcropMark, , 10, 10, BR pdfgtOutputoutput, F codepre  pas you can see I had to pass the image size to tcpdf, but this is just a test, I would like to get rid of this informations in this peace of code...

Negative 742 pI have a part which contains a codePasswordcode field which I want to be encrypted in the database. I have used Orchard.Email as an inspiration to do this, but Im running into a problem using the codeComputedFieldcode.p  pWhen editing a part, the codeComputedFieldcode should take care of the encryption. I wrote a handler which should set the codeGettercode and codeSettercode delegates for the codeComputedFieldcode, but when get to the driver to update the model, these delegates are NULL, so I get a NullReferenceException. However, when I retrieve the part, the delegates are set properly. p  pMy codep  h2Parth2  precodepublic class TaskServerPart  ContentPartltTaskServerPartRecordgt      private readonly ComputedFieldltstringgt password  new ComputedFieldltstringgt      public ComputedFieldltstringgt PasswordField              get  return password            public string Name              get  return Record.Name          set  Record.Name  value           public string Domain              get  return Record.Domain          set  Record.Domain  value           public string Username              get  return Record.Username          set  Record.Username  value            public string Password              get  return password.Value          set  password.Value  value         codepre  h2PartRecordh2  precodepublic class TaskServerPartRecord  ContentPartRecord      public virtual string Name  get set      public virtual string Domain  get set      public virtual string Username  get set      public virtual string Password  get set   codepre  h2Handlerh2  precodepublic class TaskServerPartHandler  ContentHandler      private readonly IEncryptionService encryptionService      public TaskServerPartHandlerIRepositoryltTaskServerPartRecordgt repository, IEncryptionService encryptionService              encryptionService  encryptionService         Logger  NullLogger.Instance         Filters.Addnew ActivatingFilterltTaskServerPartgtSite         Filters.AddStorageFilter.Forrepository         OnLoadedltTaskServerPartgtLoadHandlers          void LoadHandlersLoadContentContext context, TaskServerPart part              part.PasswordField.Getter gt                      try                              return String.IsNullOrWhiteSpacepart.Record.Password  String.Empty  Encoding.UTF8.GetStringencryptionService.DecodeConvert.FromBase64Stringpart.Record.Password                          catch                              Logger.ErrorThe task server password could not be decrypted.

I modified one of the properties to see what would happen and track the object. Edit I have since found to Make Object ID option in the Watch window, which tells me the same thing.li liAt this point, the driver gets called on the item which has the property value I set in step 1, but the ComputedFields Getter and Setter are NULL, so the exception occurs and the update failsli liAfter this, the Handler get called again on yet another instance of my part, I assume as a result of a redirect after the the database should have been updated.li ol  pI added an extra property to my part but not to the partrecord. If I set the value of this property when the breakpoint hits the Handler, the value is not there when I get to the driver, so Im dealing with a different part object than the one for which I set the ComputedFields delegates, though the underlying record object is the same. Using Make Object ID, I found basically the same thing Im dealing with three instances of TaskServerPart. The second instance, which is the one my Driver gets to deal with, is the only one for which the Handler isnt executed.p  pThe codeInitializedcode and codeActivatedcode events emareem being fired for the object that ends up in the driver, should I be using one of those instead of the codeLoadedcode event p

When the user accesses the page that references the SessionScoped bean the cookie is updated to have a JSESSIONID set to 49253beaee601d4107cba4b61c77, at this point an UnknownSessionException is thrown. When accessing pages that reference a managed bean annotated with either codejavax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScopedcode or codejavax.faces.view.ViewScopedcode everything works fine. p  pIt appears that when accessing a page that references a session scoped bean, the servlet container is creating a new session rather than allowing the Shiro managed session to be used. If I configure Shiro to use something other than JSESSIONID then the error isnt thrown but instead two sessions appear to be created, one managed by Shiro and the other managed by the servlet container. p  pThe contents of my shiro.ini file is p  precode[main]  authc.loginUrl  login.xhtml  authc.usernameParam  loginusername  authc.passwordParam  loginpassword  authc.rememberMeParam  loginrememberMe  user.loginUrl  login.xhtml  authc.successUrl  appindex.xhtml   sessionManager  org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager  securityManager.sessionManager  sessionManager   [users]  admin  password   [urls]  login.xhtml  authc  app  user  codepre  pMy environment is using Glassfish 4.1, Java EE version 7, Mojarra version 2.2.7 for JSF, Weld version 2.2.2 for CDI, and Shiro version 1.2.3. I have also reproduced the same issue on Glassfish version 4.0 albeit with earlier versions of Mojarra and Weld. p  pI have uploaded the relevant portion of the application server log to PasteBin which can be accessed with the URL a hrefhttppastebin.com2sPHfdTQ relnofollowhttppastebin.com2sPHfdTQa Ive also created an example Maven project to demonstrate the problem. The example project can be downloaded from a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms1x9pe2o9ja0q9jwTestJavaEEweb.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms1x9pe2o9ja0q9jwTestJavaEEweb.zipdl0a which contains the source code and the complied war file. p  pIs anyone else currently using CDI managed session scoped beans with Shiro managed sessions, and if so have you had any problems p  pIs there a configuration setting Ive missed either in Shiro or GlassFish or is this a bugp  pNote I have previously posted this question on the Shiro mailing list but Im yet to find a solution and Im hoping that there will be a wider audience on StackOverflow.p

Negative 742 pSimplified Questionp  pIs it practical for a programmer to keep track of the addresses of variables, so that a variables address can be used as a point of data on that variable p  pOriginal Questionp  pI am attempting to wrap my head around how variables are stored and referenced by address using pointers in Go.p  pAs a general principal, is it ever useful to assign a variables address directly  I can imagine a situation in which data could be encoded in the physical virtual address of a variable, and not necessarily the value of that variable.p  pFor instance, the 1000th customer has made a 500 dollars of purchases. Could I store an interger at location 1000 with a value of 500p  pI know that the common way to do something like this is with an array, where the variable at position 999 corresponds to the 1000th customer, but my question is not about arrays, its about assigning addresses directly.p  pSuppose Im dealing with billions of objects.  Is there an easy way to use the address as part of the data on the object, and the value stored at that location as different datap  pfor instance, an int at address 135851851904 holds a value of 46876, 135851851905 holds 123498761, etc. I imagine at this point an array or slice would be far too large to be efficient.p  pIncidentally, if my question due to a misunderstanding, is there a resource someone can provide which explains the topic in deep, but understandable detail  I have been unable to find a good resource on the subject that really explains the details.p

Negative 742 pI have a GPS app that uses Google Maps to handle location based events. The app handles all location events within the app and does not switch to Googles own Google Maps app.p  pThe storyboards can be seen in the image below. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuYNY3.png altenter image description herep  pIn the app I have a main map view My Map View Controller as in the StoryBoard that displays the users current location as well as a list of marked locations around the user on the map. This map also contains a button that will take the user to a list of their marked points List of Points Table View Controller. Selecting any of the list points takes them to a detailed description of the point Log a Point. And finally clicking View on Map button on this view takes them to the last view Submit Point Map View Controller where they can see this point zoomed in on another views map.p  pBoth the map views My Map View Controller AND Submit Point Map View Controller use similar code as listed below. However, when I run run the code and I get to Submit Point Map View Controller, this views viewDidLoad method is executed twice as I have noticed while stepping through the code. This causes 2 views to load, one right after the other. I can also see this happening in the emulator. On the emulator the first view that loads has a back button titled Log a Point as would be expected as this was the previous view in the stack. The next view that loads simply has Back for the back button  as can be seen on the images below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqBa5d.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYEz8K.png altenter image description herep  pThis is not an issue on the emulator and I can navigate back to Log a Point view. But on my phone the app crashes when I try and navigate back to Log a Point view and gives error strongemnested push animation can result in corrupted navigation bar. Finishing up a navigation transition in an unexpected state. Navigation Bar subview tree might get corrupted.emstrongp  pI have checked and I am not segueing to this view twice or doing anything that I am not doing on the first map view.

I think with a union, Mars would appear as its own element inside the list, which is not quite what I need. Anyway, I was hoping there would be some way in xpath I could join the children text of the parent td so that I could get Former King of Mars as an element of the outputted list. Also, there could potentially be multiple a tags within a td like for example.. King could be inside an a tag as well. Another requirement would be to keep Former President of the United States a separate element somehow recognize the br tag. Im not sure whats the best way to go about handling these cases, but I think if theres a way to do it in xpath, itll be better than working with a list in python because xpath still has reference to the dom tree. What do you guys think Thanksp

Negative 742 pIm using the Joomla Component Creator to generate scaffolding code for components. After designing the tables, fields, relations etc. the component is built, and I install it on the website that is being developed. Then I make some changes to the generated code, where this is needed. However, if I find I need some extra fields, another table, or some other change that the component creator can take care of for me, I go back to the component creator, make the desired changes, build the component, and install it again. But now all my own changes will be overwritten. I am using git, so it is possible to find the places where my own code is overwritten and undo this, but it is cumbersome and not always obvious to find my own changes. p  pSo Is there a better way to do this Some trick with git or whatever Or just some good guidelines for what I should do I understand I can make good comments before and after my own codechanges to spot these more easily, but it is still a lot of work if the code is changed many places in many files. p

When pulling object[] out of bundle and trying to cast back to my custom class, dump occurs on my phoneMOTO Razr HD, but not within my Android Studio emulator.p  pI have only gotten into Android within the past few months, and have relied heavily on their tutorialsgoogle to learn, so there is a good chance this may be a gap.p  pOk, so my purpose here is to have a Service running during my various activities, and to have said service be in charge of server communication creating a Chess game essentially for android experience.  Emulator was working as intended during my testing,but when i run on my phone, it dumps. p  pI have had other serializable objects being passed between activities within bundles, and that previously has worked fine. With the introduction of this service however, it seems to be losing sight of the actual type of Object it is shown via screenshots below, and fails to allow me to cast back from an Object[] to my GameContainer[].p  pMy next step is to try a different phone as well....usage of SharedPreferences was not working on my phone at all the logic for that happens well before the dump occurs, and only started working when i started debugging my phone, despite zero changes in my source code in that time.  My phone may just be borked.p  pHere is the debugging view of my bundles at various timesp  pa hrefhttpimgur.comahu5Tc relnofollowhttpimgur.comahu5Tcap  pimage 1 Here is the debugging view of my bundle after i have put my GameContainer[] in it via bundle.putSerializableString, Obj[] on my Phonep  pimage 2 Here is the debugging view of my bundle after broadcast receiver gets it in my main activity and before it attempts to castwhich causes the dump on my phonep  pimgae 3 ANd here is the same as above, only on my emulator on my comp.p  pI am not sure if the mMap subsets throwing the ClassNotFoundException is helpful...i see that both in my phone and emulator, which makes me assume thats simply because im placing a custom class inside the bundle.p  pSome code for you guysp  pmy Service  specifically the portion under my Runnalbe if state  RequestedGames.  p  precodepackage chess2.Services   import android.app.Service import android.content.Intent import android.content.SharedPreferences import android.os.Bundle import android.os.Handler import android.os.IBinder import android.os.Binder import android.util.Log import java.util.Date   import ServerStuff.ChessClass import chess2.source.GameBoard import chess2.source.GameContainer  public class ChessService extends Service   protected ChessClass theGame protected String myState  INITIAL protected String returnState  INITIAL protected String returnMessage   protected GameBoard myGB  null protected GameContainer[] myGC  null protected int myGameIndex  1 private static final String RM  RETURNMESSSAGE private static final String RS  RETURNSTATE private static final String RO  RETURNOBJECT private static final String RA  RETURNOBJECTARRAY  public static final String SERVERRESPONSE  com.botna.chess2.serverresponse private final Handler handler  new Handler Intent intent private Runnable sendUpdatesToActivity  new Runnable      public void run           intent.putExtraRS, returnState         intent.putExtraRM, returnMessage           if returnState.equalsREQUESTEDGAMES              Bundle b  new Bundle             b.putSerializableRA,myGC             intent.putExtrasb                  if returnState.equalsGAMELOADED                      Bundle b  new Bundle             b.putSerializableRO,myGB             intent.putExtrasb                    sendBroadcastintent           Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId      TODO do something useful      make sure our connection is still setup.     try          if theGame  null               theGame  new ChessClass                   catchException e              TODO            Gather information out fo the intent and decipher what     we need to send to the server based on MODE, STATE, PAYLOAD etc      SEnd it to the server, get our response      PUt the response in our intent.       post our updates, which will trigger stuff in the activity.

Negative 742 pA group of people that I work with need an easy invoicing system for our clients. We each have our own PayPal account. p  pWe want to be able to generate invoices where the invoice will link to the PayPal account of the person who generated it. So for example, the invoice may just have a PayPal button that links to PayPal for the client to go pay. If I was to generate the invoice, that PayPal button would be linking to me so that I get the money. If my colleague generates the invoice, the PayPal button should link to himher so that heshe gets the money. Finally, we also need to be able to retrieve the status of the invoice paid  unpaid.p  pI have been reading over PayPals API again and again, and I still dont understand how I can make something like this work. Would each of us have to generate our own API keys through PayPal to authenticate p  pI downloaded a script that works where it doesnt even ask me for any API key or Secrets or Passwords. It just asks me for my PayPal email address, and somehow it works. Its even able to retrieve the status of the payment. Can someone give me advice on how to make this workp  pEDIT The script I downloaded does have an IPN Listener, but Im still confused as to how it can retrieve the status of the PayPal payment just from my PayPal Email Address.p

Im left pondering a scenario that I cant prove emcantem happen and I cant find an answer to.p  pA Linear Hashing hashtable is characterized by an initial bucket size called emmem or emNem, a pointer that determines which bucket will be split empem or emSem, a round tracker emiem or growth factor emLem and a pair of bucket assignment functions emhsubisubem and emhsubi1subem emhsub1subem is used if the result of emhsubisubem yields an assignment address lower than the current split pointer.

But weve calculated the new address for items in bucket 0 by taking their modulus of 8, instead of 4. This emcouldem result in a new address of 0 through 7, where addresses of 5, 6 or 7 would result in failure because there arent buckets for those addresses yet.p  pThe original paper in section 2.1 asserts that the selection of the alternative hash function is deliberately chosen to protect against this. As proof, it assertsp  pfor any nonnegative integers codekcode, codeLcode, either br codek mod 2L  k mod Lcodebr or br codek mod 2L  k mod L  L.codep  pWhat is the proof of this assertion How exactly does this property of modulus division prevent an uncreated bucket from being assigned top

This has enabled PACRA in forming the right ration opinion.ltbrgt             PACRA has decided to hold PSOs rating with AA category. This category captures credit worthiness of very strong enterprises. Within the category though, the rating has been revised to AA [Previous Rating AA]. This primarily captures the uncertainty emanating from circular debt, of which PSO has become an inseparable part. This is likely to persist until structural reforms are implemented.ltbrgt              At the same time, the rating incorporate PSOs leading position in the OMC sector, its stateoftheart

Negative 742 pI know Im going very much against the grain hear but here me out...p  pI have a project that runs on Google App Engine. The project has dependency that uses a class that cant be invoked on App Engine due to security constraints its not on a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocsjavajrewhitelist relnofollowthe whitelista. My very hacky solution was to just copy a modified version of that class into my project matching the original Classs name and package that doesnt need the restricted class. This works on both dev and live, I assume because my source appears in the classpath before my external dependencies.p  pTo make it a bit cleaner, I decided to put my modified version of that class into its own project that can be packaged up in a jar and published for anyone else to use should they face this problem.p  pHeres my build.gradlep  precode my jar that has fixed version of Class. compile filespathtomyhack0.0.1.jar   dependency that includes class that wont run on appengine compile org.elasticsearchelasticsearch1.4.4 codepre  pOn my local dev server, this works fine, the code finds my hacked version of the class first at runtime. On live, for some unknown reason, the version in the elasticsearch dependency is loaded first.p  pI know having two versions of the same class in the classpath isnt ideal but I was hoping I could reliably force my version to be at the start of the classpath.

The second file is an XML file containing the data.  Merging the two works perfectly using routines from DOCX4J.  All good so far.  The problem is that the XML file contains just the file pathname to where the image is located.  So, after the merge, the Word document contains in place of the Content Control placeholders, a string indicating where the image is.  How do I go about getting an image into the document in place of the image location strings.p  pOne approach considered would be to replace the image path inside the XML data file with a base64 encoding of the image not sure exactly how to do that, but the documentation for OpenDoPE suggest it should work.  Another option seems to be to find the path strings in the alreadymerged Word document and then use something like the BinaryPartAbstractImage function from the DOCX4J library to insert the image in place.  The problem with this seems to be that any search and replace operation in an OpenXML document appears to be fraught with difficulties.p
Negative 742 pI have two view controllers, each one loading their view from their own code.xibcode file. Im using size classes to display a different layout based on whether the device is in portrait and landscape mode.p  pThe first view works fine I can change orientations and the view is updated as in the size classes.  However the second view doesnt work properly. If I present it while in portrait mode, changing to landscape doesnt update the view the way it should. However presenting it while in landscape mode works fine, and I can rotate back to portrait without issues. p  pI havent done anything differently in the two code.nibcodes, and I simply cant figure out why its not working properly.p  pHave anyone experienced the same issue before, and know how I would go about fixing itp

Negative 742 pI have initially done some tests queuing a simple print from a pthread, like the followingp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv      pthreadt thread     if  pthreadcreate ampthread, NULL, ThreadMain, NULL   0          exit1   void ThreadMain void args       uvworkt req       while1                     uvqueueworkuvdefaultloop, ampreq, printcallback, NULL   after         sleep1        void printcallback uvworkt req       printfQueuework SUCCESSFULn        sleep1     codepre  pAnd the results were as expected...after running the program, the callback was successful and the message was printed.p  pSo after this i tried to implement something more complex, instead of a print, i wanted to execute a read using codeuvfsopencodep  precodevoid ThreadMain void args       uvworkt req     const char testFileName  readfiletest.txt     IORequest readReq1       readReq1.mode  READMODE     readReq1.fileName  testFileName      req.data  void ampreadReq1      while1                     uvqueueworkloop, ampreq, executeIOcallback, NULL after         sleep3        void executeIOcallback uvworkt req          int mode     IORequest ioreq  IORequest reqgtdata      mode  ioreq.mode      ifmode  READMODE              printfREAD MODEnn         uvfsopenuvdefaultloop, ampopenreq, ioreq.fileName, ORDONLY, 0, readonopen          else if mode  WRITEMODE              printfWRITE MODEnn         uvfsopenuvdefaultloop, ampopenreq, ioreq.fileName, OWRONLY  OCREAT, SIRWXO, writeonopen          else         fprintfstderr, Requested IO mode not supportedn       sleep1     codepre  pSo my problem begins in the codeexecuteIOcallbackcode. Apparently, the program freezes after codeuvfsopencode but i dont understand why... The last thing to appear on the console is my codeREADMODEcode print. It doesnt seem to be calling the codereadonopencode callback.p
Negative 742 pIf understood correctly, a user can have the option of creating a gmail email address with a nongmail email a hrefhttpsaccounts.google.comsignup relnofollowSignUpa. p  pHowever hotmailoutlook addresses filter spam poorly. On many occasions, emails dont even enter the junk or inbox folders. This is very troublesome. p  pIf an old hotmailoutlook address is used for the gmail signup. Do the emails still go through hotmailoutlooks filters, so is gmail just copying all emails that the account receives, OR do emails now go through gmails filtersp
Negative 742 pIm running the latest version of Dolphin, but Ive seen where similar things happened to Chrome users. p  pWhen I perform a Google search, certain pages will open fine in a new tab, but simply clicking those search results will open up the Play Store and search for an app. Wikipedia is the most annoying culprit, but it also does this for any message board that leads with a TapaTalk prompt. If I have the app installed, it simply opens that link in the app without so much as a prompt on what Id like to open it with.p  pDolphin doesnt have any settings relevant to this only Google and Google Maps have openinapp options. Similarly, there is no setting for this under my phones default apps.p  pI CAN eliminate this behavior by switching my search engine to something other than Google, but Id rather not for obvious reasons.p  pI CAN also eliminate it by disabling JavaScript, but that is also not an option I like. It does tell me, however, that this hijacking of browser behavior is being done through Google.p  pIs there any convenient way to make this stop without changing my search engine or disabling JavaScript Are there settings Im missing somewhere I only started having this problem pretty recently.p
