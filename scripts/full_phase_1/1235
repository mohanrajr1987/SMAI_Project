Positive 1235 pBeginner here.p  pI have an application built in MFC Vicual C, compiled using VS2010. I have a DSN as an ODBC connection to a live Excel spreadsheet via Excel driver.p  pMy app queries a spreadsheet every second. If one cells value changes a result of a simple calculation involving other cells receiving a live data feed, the app prints the new value then goes back to querying for changes.p  pThe App works fine for a period of time, dutifully printing the changes in the cells value as new data arrives in the feed. Then, it invariably generates an errorp  pThe Microsoft Jet Engine could not find the object unknown Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name correctly.p  pThe file paths are all given in absolutes.p  pI surmise that the error is generated whenever the query happens to exactly coincide with the cells contents being updated. I can generate the exact same error message and behavior, always, instantly, by clicking on the surveyed cell and touching a key beginning to edit the cell, here by overtyping the cell formula.p  pAn Afx error dialog runs. If I OK and select the excel file, the application goes back and runs, until a new same error. But if I select Cancel the application exits. p  pIf I comment out my own error catch, this dialog still appears.p  pI would like the application to run headless and merely retry to connect with the database. p  pIs there any way I can override herep  pI realize Excel is not amenable to concurrent multiuser access.

So I passed the CDerivedView handle viewhWnd from above code to TestApp using a ONCOPY message. Then TestApp does a SendMessageviewhWnd,WMCLOSE,NULL, NULL. The same error was got.  This approach was tried to rule out the possibility of the CDesignView not being an active window at the time of the SendMessage. In this case, I manually click on the CView of MFCApp before letting the  TestApp send the message. p  pNone of these seem to work. Any suggestions you can provide to proceed will be of great help.

Negative 1235 pIm working on a feature which requires me to get the contents of a webpage, then check to see if certain text is present in that page.  Its a backlink checking tool.p  pThe problem is this  the function runs perfectly most of the time, but occasionally, it flags a page for not having a link when the link is clearly there.  Ive tracked it down to the point of visually comparing the strings in the output, and they match just fine, but using the  operator, php tells me they dont match.p  pRecognizing that this is probably some sort of encoding issue, I decided to see what would happen if I used base64encode on them, so I could see if doing so produced different results between the two strings which appear to be exactly the same.p  pMy suspicions were confirmed  using base64encode on the strings to be compared yielded a different string from each.  Problem found  The problem is, I dont have any idea how to solve it.p  pIs there some way I can make these strings uniform based on the outputted text which matches, so that when I compare them in php, they matchp

In doing so I get the following error a lotp  precodeWarning mysqliresultclose Couldnt fetch mysqliresult codepre  pI think I get the above specifically because its trying to close the query twice in a row.p  pCurrently my class can make prepared and unprepared statements. So I try to close queries  statements in 2 places. I check when preparing a statement if I have already prepared a statement, if so I need to close the old one before I make a new one and lastly in the destructor of the class.p  pI realize I could just close the query  statement after Ive pulled and stored the result but this seems to be messy for a few reasons. For one it removes the possibility of reusing the prepared statement. As well as disallowing me to pull some information about the query after its been run such as affected rows and the like.p  pI know I could just store this info for every query and what not but it just seems like the proper way to go about this problem would be to close  free the query  statement if I need to make another one, and again at the end of the script.p  pI have tried looking around and reading up on how I should properly handle this task but I have been unable to come up with anything.p  pSo my question is, is there anyway to test if a query or statement needs to be closed or freed Or is there a better way I should be attempting to tackle this issuep  pThanks for any help or insight anyone can offer.p

Negative 1235 pIm building an interpreter and as Im aiming for raw speed this time, every clock cycle matters for me in this raw case.p  pDo you have any experience or information what of the both is faster Vector or Array All what matters is the speed I can access an element opcode receiving, I dont care about inserting, allocation, sorting, etc.p  pIm going to lean myself out of the window now and sayp  ul listrongArrays are at least a bit faster than vectors in terms of accessing an element i.strongli ul  pIt seems really logical for me.

Negative 1235 pI would like to ask you about what formal system could be more interesting to implement from scratchreverse engineer. p  pIve looked through some existing and rather open open in the sense of freeopensource projects of logicaldeclarative programming systems.

Negative 1235 pIs it possible to embed a console window inside a WPF windowp  pAs a little background, at first I tried to implement a console window from scratch in WPF, which was successful except for one huge problem  its extremely slow. See the question herebr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3219819vt100terminalemulationinwindowswpforsilverlighthttpstackoverflow.comquestions3219819vt100terminalemulationinwindowswpforsilverlightap  pSince that does not seem to be an option I am instead looking at hosting an actual console window in my WPF application, which Ive learned how to do as described herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions160587nooutputtoconsolefromawpfapplicationhttpstackoverflow.comquestions160587nooutputtoconsolefromawpfapplicationap  pAnd thats great, by ideally Id like to have that console window look like it is a part of the rest of the WPF application. I know it is possible with a WinForms app as Ive seen it done, involving using the SetParent Win32 API. You can see an example .NET project that does it with this CommandBar project that embeds a console window into the shellp  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcscommandbar.aspxhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcscommandbar.aspxap  pSo I am hopeful it can be done with WPF as well, but I have no idea how youd do that. Help is much appreciated also, if you have any brilliant solutions to my original problem of creating a terminal window from scratch in WPF since that would solve my needs too.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong  p  pWith help Reed Copseys help I was able to get the Console Window embedded. However, of course it needed to be styled and moved or else it just looked like a regular console window inside a WPF window. I need the title bar and large borders removed. Doing research I figured out how to use the Win32 APIs to do that like thisp  precodeuint style  GetWindowLongConsoleManager.ConsoleWindowHandle, GWLSTYLE style amp uintWindowStyles.WSCAPTION style amp uintWindowStyles.WSTHICKFRAME style amp uintWindowStyles.WSDLGFRAME style amp uintWindowStyles.WSPOPUP SetWindowLongConsoleManager.ConsoleWindowHandle, GWLSTYLE, style MoveWindowConsoleManager.ConsoleWindowHandle, 0, 0, intWindowsFormsHost.ActualWidth, intWindowsFormsHost.ActualHeight, true codepre  pHowever theres one big problem. For some reason, the console window has a rendering artifact. Its as if it is not repainting itself on the bottom left and top right sides. The width of the artifact is similar to the width of the title bar and the thick border, and in fact if I leave the thick border in the size of the artifact goes down. But simply repainting it wont help since it reappears. I can, for example, move the window off the screen and back again to fix it, but it soon reappears on its own  p  pimg srchttpimg837.imageshack.usimg8376241renderissue.png altrendering artifactp  pstrongUPDATE 2strong The effect happens even if I dont parent it into the WindowsFormsHost control. All I need to do to reproduce it is launch the console using AllocConsole and then remove its title bar with SetWindowLong. This is a win7 machine.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong It seems messing with other windows like this isnt supported. The console window calculates its textarea assuming there is a caption, so theres no way around this. I think my only option to get consolelike behavior in WPF is going to be to write a custom WinForms control and then embed that into WPF.p

Negative 1235 pIve been tasked with creating an application that works with thousands of images, far too many to load into RAM all at once. I guess its somewhat analogous to a photo viewer like Picassa, in that at any given moment the application needs the pixel data from only a handful of the total cataloged images. The application must also handle extremely large images, where only some small subset of the pixel data would actually be required at any given time for image analysis or display, which, I suppose, is somewhat analogous to Google Earth. In short, the application must dynamically load only the portion of the pixel data that is actually required at any given time.p  pHaving dealt only with static image loading typical of image libraries like OpenCV, CImg, or Magick, Im at a bit of a loss how I might best approach the problem. So my question is are there any standard design patterns for this requirement, or approaches to solving this or a similar problemp  pBTW, for small images, I realize that I could simply delay loading of the image until it is needed, but there are two key problems that spring to mind with that approach. 1 This doesnt solve the large image problem. 2 Since unloading the image immediately after it is used could be inefficient, I would need some type of memory management handler in the application that only unloads images when new images are loaded and some memory threshold has been passed. Clearly a similar memory management issue remains for portions of a larger image loaded into memory. I will plainly admit that such a tool is beyond my knowledge and experience, so if that is the prevailing answer to this question, then I have a supplemental question. Could anyone recommended some basic tutorials on memory managementp  pThank you for the helpp  pUPDATE For those who are curious, I thought Id share the approach I took. The image class I created lazy loads the image data. To solve the problem with loading thousands of images, I created a class that would keep track of the file handles Windows has a limit  see getmaxstdio, and the amount of image memory that was loaded, unloading as necessary. To handle very large images, I used the VXL image library as a backend, which is able to load a subsection of a large image. Granted this isnt so efficient for some images compressed images especially, but since Im mostly working with tiled TIFF images, it works very well.p

Negative 1235 pIm currently working in an area that is related to simulation and trying to design a data structure that can include random variables within matrices. To motivate this let me say I have the following matrixp  p[a b c d]p  pI want to find a data structure that will allow for a, b, c, d to either be real numbers or random variables. As an example, lets say that a  1, b  1, c  2 but let d be a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and SD 1.p  pThe data structure that I have in mind will give no value to d. However, I also want to be able to design a function that can take in the structure, simulate an uniform0,1, obtain a value for d using an inverse CDF and then spit out an actual matrix.p  pI have several ideas to do this all related to the MATLAB icdf function but would like to know how more experienced programmers would do this. In this application, its important that the structure is as lean as possible since I will be working with very very large matrices and memory will be an issue.p  pstrongEDIT 1strong  p  pThank you all for the feedback. I have decided to use a cell structure and store random variables as function handles. To save some processing time for large scale applications, I have decided to reference the location of the random variables to save time during the evaluation part.p

I know that once the service is reached codeClient.TemplateInfocode and codeAdminClient.TemplateInfocode are the same thing. p  pIm trying to figure out how to instantiate TemplateInfo andor cast it to work with both client and admin methods. There is a decent amount of code to create this object so I was hoping not to duplicate that for each type.p  pThe types are defined in shared assemblies and I am Reusing types in my proxy. But I get the two different types because I have two service references.p  pIt would be great to do something like AdminClientTemplateInfo, but perhaps Ill create a clone method to convert the types.p

Negative 1235 pI currently have a web server and a file server on my lan both have static IPs on the LAN, and the router forwards inbound port 80 traffic to the web server, so the file server is only accessible internally. p  pIm toying with the idea of writing a small PHP app that will let me interact with the file server via the web server. So, I wouldnt change anything at the router level  anyone scanning my public IP would still only find port 80 on the webserver. p  pMy questions are pretty high level and dont necessarily have a right answer. I can see a few ways of doing this, and then looking to open it up for input  ideas. p  pOne is to exec ssh from the webserver to the fileserver, and just run shell commands via execssh that return directory listings, scp files that I upload, etc. This way is no better than giving someone root on my fileserver if they compromise my php front end, so Im not too keen on that idea, but am considering it. p  pAnother way would be to just duplicate the contents of the fileserver to the webserver drive, and sync them up periodically, but thats impractical and defeats the purpose of having a central file server, so Ive pretty much already dismissed that idea.p  pThats about all I have so far. Anyone have thoughts or opinionsp

Negative 1235 pI just need a publickey encryption scheme that I can use to encrypt parameters being sent by an iPhone app to PHP on a server.  I cant use GnuPG because of its license.p  pThe requirements are that the app on the phone be able to communicate with the server without the user entering any credentials.  My goal here is to prevent examination of the parameters in the URL and abuse of our system through spoofing.  Thus all copies of our app in the wild can look like the same user for purposes of encryption.p  pI havent been planning to use HTTPS, because if Im not mistaken it needs sessions or certificates and it seems excessive but let me know if not I just need to encrypt and decrypt the parameter portion of the URL.p  pSince the data to encrypt with an RSA public key must be shorter than the key, the standard procedure is to generate a symmetric private key, encrypt that with the public key, encrypt the data with the generated private key, and then send the generated private key and the encrypted data to the server.  It looks like I have most of what I need to encrypt the generated key except RSAsize crashes in the process.  But I dont know how to specify and set up the encoding of the bulk data with Blowfish or some other algorithm supported by PHP.p  pThanks for any insight.p
Negative 1235 pI have found a lot of great information comparing InProc, StateServer, and SQLServer for ASP.NET state management, but I cant seem find any performance benchmark comparisons.

I realize that its going to vary greatly by application and environment, but having a relative idea of how they compare would be valuable.p  pDo you know of any benchmarks that have been performed that you could share or have any personal experience with this Thank youp

Negative 1235 pHellobrthis weekend I started to watch the 2011 WWDC videos. Ive found really interesting topics about iOS. My favorites were about performance and graphics, but Ive found two of them apparently in contradiction. Of course there is something that I didnt get. The sessions that Im talking about are Understanding UIKit Rendering 121 and Polishing your app 105. br Unfortunately sample code from 2011 is still not downloadable, so is pretty hard to have an overall view. In one session they explain that most of times offscreen rendering should be avoided during visualization in scrollview etc. They fix the performance issues in the sample code almost drawing everything inside the drawRect method. In the other session the performance issue on a table view seems to be due to too much code in the drawRect method of the tables cells.br First is not clear to me when an OffScreen rendering is required by the system, Ive seen in the video that some quartz function such as cornerRadious, shadowOffset, shadowColor requires it, but does exist a general rulebr Second I dont know if I understood well, but it seems that when there is no offscreen rendering adding layers or views is the way to go. I hope someone could bring light about that..br Thanks,br Andreap

In the tree below, an ancestor of node N is represented as n.

If node Ds state switched to 0, the you could describe the tree state as [a not d].p  pAre there data structures or algorithms that can be used to solve a problem of this type  Any thoughts on a better approach  Any thoughts on the analysis algorithmp  pThanksp

Negative 1235 pIm working on a plan to increase performance and scalability of a web app by caching a user database for a WCF web service.  Goals are to increase performance by accessing this data inProc vs a round trip the database server, as well as increase scalability of the service by reducing the load on the database server, thus allowing more web servers to be added to increase scale.p  pIn researching AppFabric, I really dont see the value in my situation because it seems like for the most part, Im just replacing a round trip to the database with a round trip to a cache cluster which seems like it might even have more overhead than the db to keep nodes in synch.p  pFor the performance question, it seems like using the asp.net cache in process would be much faster than a round trip to the cache cluster, even though the data is in memory on those servers, and even if some of it is cached locally I believe that would still be out of process from the web app.p  pFor the scalability issue, it also seems easier to be able to add identical web servers to a web farm each caching the user data in process, rather than manage a cache cluster seperately which adds complexity.p  pWith that said, could someone explain why I would choose one approach over the other, given my stated goals  If you recommend the AppFabric approach, can you explain how the performance would be better than storing data in the asp.net cache in process.p  pThanksp

Negative 1235 pNear as I can tell, CouchDB revisions are not to be treated like revisions in the strongdocument versioningstrong sense of the word. From glancing at other posts, they seem to be regarded as transient data that exists until a coarsegrained strongcompactstrong operation is called.p  pMy question is, if I am interested in using CouchDB to maintain documents, as well as a versionhistory of those documents, should I allow that to be handled natively by CouchDB revisions, or should I build a layer ontop that will survive a compact operationp  pI am thinking the latter, simply because Couch does not replicate revisions of documents, only the latest update. This makes me think strongrevisionstrong is a misleading name, as its more of a data structure for stabilizing replication.p

I searched the internet for more help and came across p  pa hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgoooshowbug.cgiid87731 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgoooshowbug.cgiid87731ap  pThe xsltemplate tags provided here helped in exporting the most of the content. 1. The XForm instance, model, binding etc.p  pHowever the actual controls were still missing...p  pI believe the trick lies in xsltemplate tags, but have no documentation to understand how the export feature uses them.p  pAny ideas on thisp

Negative 1235 pI have a WPF DataGrid bound to a DataTable. I fill the underlying DataSet from an arbitrary table in a database. Ive attached to both the DataTable codeRowChangingcode and codeRowChangedcode events. As the user changes a row, these events fire and allow me to validate the row.p  pTo get the optimal behavior from the DataGrid, it seems apparent to me that the codee.Row.RowErrorcode message should be set and and exception thrown from the codeRowChangingcode event handler. I have some xaml that marks the row as error in the row header so its visible and I get a nice tooltip with the error message. By optimal, I mean that the escape sequences that one expects with these grids works as expected when the validation is handled as described. Trying to perform the same validation from the codeRowChangedcode event makes for some funky behavior that does not roll back the edits properly.p  pThe problem that I have is that I need to update the underlying DataSet so all the DB validation rules are applied and collisions with other users changes can be detected in the codeRowChangingcode handler. If the action fails, I can flag the validation as described. But, the codee.Row.RowStatecode comes in as Unchanged and if I pass its containing DataSet to my DB update method, its codeDataAdapter.UpdatemyDataTablecode method does not see the row as changed and, therefore, does nothing. This behavior contrasts with what would happens when I do the same in the codeRowChangedcode handler. At that point, the record CurrentOriginalProposed values are updated and the record marked Modified. p  pAn DataAdapter update at that point results in database activity. But, Im at the wrong point in the event sequence in the case of a failure. I can flag the error but the rollback behavior for the grid will not work correctly typically results in the changed cells not rolling back.p  pMy question is, how does one get the record or a copy of the record in the Modified state so the database will be updated I normally use a typed DataSet but this time I am going after arbitrary tables and, therefore, am using a DataSet.p

Negative 1235 pIve seen a lot of posts here which describes the separation of concerns regarding organizing your app in bundles which work on their containing entities. But none of them states the point that these entities are related through different bundles.p  pAs I already have an existing database which contains tables for posts, comments, tags, users, roles and some more I want to import this definition into my new symfony2 project.

Negative 1235 pI have a really simple task to do which is to draw a background image in a custom View. I create a bitmap and scale it to fit the width and height of the view. This makes the app way slower, like half as fast I print out the value of time every 10 milliseconds to measure the speed of performance. This is the codep  precodepublic class GView extends View   int w, h Bitmap bg int time  0  boolean created  false public GViewContext context      supercontext     bg  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources, R.drawable.myimage     new Timer   Override public void onDrawCanvas c      Paint p  new Paint     ifcreated          wgetWidth         hgetHeight         p.setColorColor.RED         p.setTextSize40         bg  Bitmap.createScaledBitmapbg, w, h, false         created  true          ifcreated          time         c.drawBitmapbg, 0,0,null         c.drawTexttime, intw4,  inth4, p         class Timer extends Handler      private Timer          handleMessageobtainMessage0           Override     public void handleMessageMessage m          invalidate         sendMessageDelayedobtainMessage0, 10       codepre  pp  pFYI, the original image is 300x225. The screen res of my tablet that I scale the image to is 1280x800. The thing is if I scale the background image to sth like int.8w, int.8h or sth smaller or not scale the image at all, then it runs fast as expected.p  pI tried using ImageView and use setImageResourceR.drawable.myimage but it was as slow though. I thought drawing an image to fit the background should be very simple for any programming languages, but Ive had this problem for a really long time even after a lot of searching. I hope somebody can give me a proper answer. I would really appreciate that.p
Negative 1235 pFirst, sorry about the title of this question. I thought about it for a long time and could do no better.p  pMy question is can jQueryUIs autocomplete feature provide suggestions from multiple database fields under one autocomplete field. For instance, Id want to be able to type in br in the field and have both briman057 and Brian Johnson appear as suggestions even though they are stored in separate database fields and are returned as two separate key value pairs of the same JSON item ie. [username  briman057, name  Brian Johnson]. Id then want the username value to be the one that populates the field when either it or the full name are selected. I know that one of the keys needs to be named value or label and that the key by that name is the one that is used to provide suggestions, but can I essentially have two value keys for one JSON itemp

When the editor already approves the email, it will then get sent to the client by the editor but still using the original sender in the From and ReplyTo field.p  pI found some pointers from this site  a hrefhttpwww.devco.netarchives20060324savingcopiesofallemailusingexim.php relnofollowhttpwww.devco.netarchives20060324savingcopiesofallemailusingexim.phpa.p  pOnce the filters are in place, I want to make a simple PHP interface for the editor to check the forwarded emails and edit them if necessary. The editor can then click on an Approve button that will finally deliver the message using the original sender.p  pIm also thinking that maybe a PHPless system will be enough. The editor can receive the emails from his own email client edit them and simply send the email as if he is the original sender.p  ol liIs my plan feasibleli liWill there be issues that I have overlookedli liDoes it have the danger of being treated as spam by the other mailservers since Ill be messing up the headersli ol

Negative 1235 pI have a main program  mytool.pl to be run from the command line.  There are several auxillary scripts  special1.pl, special2.pl, etc.  which each contain a couple subroutines and a hash, all identically named across scripts.  Lets suppose these are named MySpecialFunction, AnotherSpecialFunction and SpecialData.   p  pId like for mytool to includeuseimport the contents of one of the special.pl files, only one, according to a command line option. For example, the user will dop  precodebashgt perl mytool.pl  specialcase5 codepre  pand mytools will use MySpecialFunction from special5.pl, and ignore all other special.pl files.p  pIs this possible and how to do it p  pIts important to note that the selection of which special file to use is made at runtime, so adding a use at the top of mytool.pl probably isnt the right thing to do. p  pNote I am a longtime C programmer, not a perl expert I may be asking something obvious. This is for a oneoff project that will turn to dust in only a month.  Neither mytool.pl nor special.pl nor perl itself will be of interest beyond the end of this short project.  Therefore, we dont care for solutions that are elaborate or require learning some deep magic.  Quick and dirty preferred.  Im guessing that Perls module mechanism is overkill for this, but have no idea what the alternatives are.p

Negative 1235 pI am trying to graph families of curves using Matplotlib. I am graphing the data directly using scatter and then plotting a fit line least squares from scipy using plot. I do not know how many sets of data there will be beforehand, or the limits, etc. p  pI need to be able to cycle the colors of these lines and points so everything from one set of data matches. Plot rotates colors using some internal default and scatter is coming out as all one color.

Negative 1235 pSo I am wanting to start playing with OpenGL with a view to implement some game ideas I have had for a long time now, but I noticed there are several versions of OpenGL.p  pI ideally would like to support older computers too, so I was wondering if OpenGL 2.1 would be the best version to use. OpenGL 4 doesnt even work on my desktop machine Op  pThe type of minimum spec for the game would be DX9 era graphics cards, so basically most modern computers would run it even the low end onboard graphics. I would be looking at JOGL for implementation as I know Java the best have done Java3D in the past and I would like to deploy to all 3 major OSs.p  pWith this in mind what kind of books would you suggest to me Would it be pointless getting a OpenGL 3 or 4 book as I have read that there are big changes Should I settle for an older book on 2.1 insteadp

Negative 1235 pSo I have a codeSimpleAdaptercode set up and I want to add an codeeditTextcode above it that you can enter your search query into and have the list update in realtime.p  pI know I can already codesetTextFilterEnabledtruecode and force a keyboard popup.

Negative 1235 p1st of all, sorry for using that channel, but theres no other open communication channel for Drive SDK issues.p  pSee, the thing is, if you try to access a Google Drive document that you do not have access to from your browser you get a nice warning that allows you to ask for access to the file so, you get CONFIRMATION that the document exists, and that you DO NOT have access to it.p  pIf you try to access a file you do not have access to from the API you get a 404, which does not confirm the document exists.p  pThat is awfull, specially when working on your Google Apps domain, i.e I may have access today to file X from user U and tomorrow user U looses access to this file ie change of ownership from the API I will get a 404 with absolutely no pointer to where I should look for that file or if it even existssp  pFrom the browser youd just ask for access and wait, but from the API you have two options a assume the file is gone or b query for that file from EVERY user account you know about.p  pSo, that goes to my suggestionrequest Please do not respond to a 404 when theres a better code for that, a 403 would be nice.. Also, please, add a pointer about where to go on the response code. You could also keep the 404 but adding the pointer of a owner.p  pAnd, finally, find some way for service accounts to search strongeverythingstrong inside a domain p  pthanks, marcp

Negative 1235 pFirst Ill mention what I am trying to achieve. I am using CodeIgniter framework of PHP. I have 5 tables in my database and I want to display them in Datatables format on a button click on the display page. I am using server side processing php as data source. So at first I made the code for displaying only one table in Datatable format and was successful in it. Now I want to display one table at a time out of 5 on button click event. But aColumns length should be equal to number of columns defined in HTML table. Now considering marks tabe, it has 4 columns studentid, examid, subjectid and marksachieved. Now another table is branch and has 2 columns only branchid and branchname. So I cannot increase or decrease  tags in HTML dynamically so I am confused.

Negative 1235 pSo Im working on something akin to a Camera app. It draws a live camera preview on a native OpenGL texture.

When codetakePicturecode is not called, everything functions according to plan. Preview frames arrive, theyre processed, buffer is requeued. However, if I codestartPreviewcode then do codetakePicturecode, the picture callback gets a null data array. Every time. Google docs have this to say about codetakePicturecodep  pcodeThe raw callback occurs when the raw image data is available NOTE the data will be null if there is no raw image callback buffer available or the raw image callback buffer is not large enough to hold the raw image.codep  pThis is not entirely clear to me, asbrp  ol liThere is no function to set buffer for still capture, only for prevew framesbrli liEven if the same buffer is used for both still caps and preview frames, I do have a buffer queued up.brli liAdding a second buffer identical to the preview buffer specifically for still caps has absolutely no effectbrli liPreview has to be started in order for codetakePicturecode to be a valid call.li ol  pAm I missing something obvious Or are we not allowed to get raw frames from video and still at the same time There is nothing in the docs about this whatsoever. Ive looked at the camera source as well, but to no avail.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pPS. Ive tried using a different color format for the still, unsetting preview callback before taking a picture, adding a second buffer, requeueing the second buffer, setting surface holder to push type, and some other things that I am failing to recall at the moment. None made any difference.p

Negative 1235 pMy problem is that I have a UIContainerView that has a subView of UITableView.  When a user presses a button this UIContainerView toggles openedclosed by animating its frame size. The issue I have is that, because the frame size is set immediately and the animation happens over time, the TableView cells get dequeued and disappear, before the animation is complete. Im guessing because the tableView thinks it is no longer being displayed.p  pIs there anyway to delay this, until the animation is complete. Perhaps in the completion section of voidanimateWithDuration...p

Negative 1235 pI am trying to generate a certain amount of random uniform points inside a rectangle I know the pair of coordinates for each corner.p  pLet our rectangle be  ABCDp  pMy idea is  Divide the rectangle into two triangles by the AC diagonal. Find the slope and the intercept of the diagonal. Then, generate two random numbers from [0,1] interval, let them be a,b. Evaluate x  aAB and y  bAD AB, AD, distances. If A is not 0,0, then we can add to x and y As coordinates. Now we have a point x,y. If it is not in the lower triangle ABC, skip to the next step. Else, add the point to our plot and also add the symmetric of x,y vs. the AC diagonal so that we can fill the upper triangle ADC too.p  pI have implemented this, but I highly doubt that the points are uniformly generated judging from the plot. How should I modify my algorithm I guess that the issue is related to how I pick the triangle and the symmetric thing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgVQAS.png altPicturep

Negative 1235 pFor a current OpenCL GPGPU project, I need to sort elements in an array according to some key with 64 possible values. I need the final array to have all elemens with the same key to be contiguous. Its sufficient to have an associative array codenewindex[oldindex]code as the output of this task.p  pI split the task into two parts. First, I count for each possible key bucket the number of elements with this key that go into that bucket. I scan this array generate a prefix sum which indicates the new index range of the elements for each bucket, like start indices per bucket.p  pThe second step will then have to assign each element a new index. If I was to implement this on a CPU, the algorithm would be something like thisp  precodefor all elements e     newindex[e]  bucketstart[buckete] codepre  pOf course, this doesnt work on the GPU. Every item needs to access the codebucketstartcode array in readwrite mode which is essentially a synchronization between all work items, the worst we can do.p  pAn idea is to put some computation in work groups. But Im not sure how this should be done exactly, since Im not experienced in GPGPU computing.p  pIn global memory, we have the bucket start array initialized with the prefix sum as above. Access to this array is mutexed with an atomic int. Im new to this, so maybe mixing some words here.p  pEvery work group is implicitly assigned a part of the input element array. It uses a local bucket array containing the new indices, relative to a global bucket start which we do not yet know. After one of these local buffers is full, the work group has to write the local buffers into global array. For this, it locks access to the global bucket start array, increments these values by the current local bucket sizes, unlocks, and then can write the result into the global codenewindexcode array by adding the according offset. This process is repeated until all assigned elements are processed.p  pTwo questions arisep  ol lipstrongIs this a good approachstrong I know that reading and writing fromto global memory is most likely the bottleneck here, especially since Im trying to acquire synchronized access to at least only a small part of the global memory. But maybe there is a much better approach to do this, maybe using kernel decomposition. Note that I try to avoid reading back data from GPU to CPU during kernels to avoid an OpenCL command queue flush, which is also bad as I was tought.pli lipIn the algorithm design above, stronghow do I implement the locking mechanismstrong Will something like the following code work In particular, I expect problems when the hardware executes work items truly parallel in SIMD groups, like Nvidia warps. In my current code, all items of a work group would try to acquire the lock in an SIMD fashion.

Negative 1235 pIve asked a similar question before, but this time the situation is a bit different.p  pFor one, this time around Im using ARC inviting a whole new world of problems. Second The code I have basically works, but Im wondering if I could do with less code.p  pRight now, my code looks like thisp  precodeweak CustomType Object void doAverageCustomType , int, int  CustomType Trigger, int Val1, int Val2      Calculations with Trigger   CustomType Addint, CustomType   int Val1, CustomType NewObject      Checks prerequisites, and returns either the passed object after adding it to      an array or nil, if the prerequisites havent been met.  codepre  pNow, further down the line, Im doing thisp  precodeObject  Add1, [CustomType makeObjectWithParameters] [Object addCallback doAverageObject, 56, 57 ] codepre  pInside codeaddCallbackcode, the passed block with the call to codedoAveragecode is sent a codecopycode message and saved for later execution.p  pThis works, no retain cycles, the callbacks fold if the object is deallocated.p  pBut its not as elegant as Id like.p  pWhat Id like would be something along these linesp  precodeblock weak CustomType Object  CustomType Addint, CustomType   int Val1, CustomType NewObject      Checks prerequisites, and returns either the passed object after adding it to      an array or nil, if the prerequisites havent been met.     Object  NewObject  codepre  pAnd further down the linep  precode[Add1, [CustomType makeObjectWithParameters] addCallback doAverageObject, 56, 57 ] codepre  pHowever if I do it like this, itll change the codeObjectcode passed to the callback to whatever codeAddcode I called last, which isnt what I want.p  pBasically Id need to codesetcode the value of codeObjectcode in a block and then codecopycode that reference as a parameter, instead of passing the reference to the variable itself.p  pFurthermore, as a second step, itd be about perfect, if I didnt have to pass the parameter codeObjectcode in the first place, but could use it in the block. But if I do that, the variable in the block will default to nil when the block is finally called well past the expiration of the scope it was defined in.p  pSo instead ofp  precodevoid doAverageCustomType , int, int  CustomType Trigger, int Val1, int Val2      Calculations with Trigger  codepre  pId like to do usep  precodevoid doAverageint, int  int Val1, int Val2      Calculations with Object  codepre  pWith whatever value codeObjectcode weak reference had at that moment in time.p  pIs either of the two somehow possiblep  pThank you very much.p  pEditp  pFollowing the below suggestion, I refactored my code like thisp  precodetypedef BOOL stackBlockt typedef BOOL CallBlocktweak id Object  void addCallbackCallBlocktB      stackBlockt stackBlock           weak id Object  self         return BObject           Callback  [stackBlock copy]  codepre  pIm trying to call this construct withp  precode[Add1, CustomType makeObjectWithParameters] addCallBack doAverageObject, 56, 57 ] codepre  pHowever codeObjectcode isnt defined for the codedoAveragecode block for some reason, and I dont quite know why. After all, its a block of type codeCallBlocktcode, which takes a parameter of type codeidcode and the name codeObjectcode. Shouldnt it know about the variable codeObjectcode thenp  pEdit 2 After a bit of tinkering around namely using the actual type and stuff, it now gives me a different error message codeIncompatible block pointer types sending void void to parameter of type CallBlocktcode, though Im not. I want that block to return a codeBOOLcode and take the argument codeObjectcode...what am I doing wrongp  pEdit 3 I may have found it. I was missing something in my codeaddCallbackcode call. I have yet to test it, but it would seem, that Im required to call it like thisp  precode[Add1, CustomType makeObjectWithParameters] addCallBackCustomObject Object doAverageObject, 56, 57 ] codepre  pThinking about it, it makes sense...its horrible on the eyes, but it makes sense. And it works like a charm. I dont even need excess variables of type codeblockcode any more.p

Negative 1235 pI am using GWT 2.5 for an application. I have some static HTML with a specially named div, and I am using HTMLPanel.wrap to replace that div with a GWT login panel. Once the user logs in I am using DOM.removeChild to remove all the static elements from the page and use nothing but GWT widgets. This all works great. The static HTML looks something likep  precodeltbodygtltdiv idmaincontentgtltdiv idembedcontentgtltdivgtltdivgtltbodygt codepre  pHowever, after logging out, I would like to replace all the static elements I had previously removed and replace the special div with the login panel again so that it looks the same as when you first log in.

My code to wrap the div isp  precode  RootPanel rpe  RootPanel.getembedcontent   rpe.clear   Element child   whilechild  DOM.getFirstChildrpe.getElement  null     DOM.removeChildrpe.getElement, child      HTMLPanel.wraprpe.getElement.addthis codepre  pwith this being an HTMLPanel.

At that point the embedcontent element exist and everything is happy except I get the error mentioned above on the HTMLPanel.wrap statement. So I dont know if I am using the wrong approach, or what.

Negative 1235 pIm playing around with an Atmel AT91SAM7S microcontroller, and it looks like IRQ handlers are supposed to execute in supervisor mode, while main loop code executes in system mode. Plus, Im supposed to reserve a certain portion of RAM to be used as stack by supervisor mode code. The startup assembly code I have obtained from a demo program reserves 128 bytes by default.p  pWhy do I have to reserve separate stack space for supervisor mode why cant it just use the same stack as system mode main What is the benefit of interrupt handling code having a completely different stack than main loop code I see that the current assembly code for IRQ handling switches from IRQ mode to supervisor mode before jumping to an interrupt handler. Would it be appropriate to execute the interrupt handler in user mode instead If so, is there anything I need to be careful withp  pIm asking because if the interrupts have their own stack, I need to estimate an upper bound on how much stack space would be used by interrupts in the worst case. If interrupts used the same stack as main, there would be no need to do that, as long as there actually is enough RAM available which most certainly is, I wont be using that much.p  pThe only thing I can think of is that having a separate stack would be useful if youre implementing an operating system with some kind of memory protection but since Im not doing that, does it matterp  pP.S. Im familiar with AVRs and their interrupt handling.p  pstrongClarificationstrongp  pIt appears interrupt handling begins when the CPU jumps to address 0x18, which contains a branch instruction to codeAT91FIrqHandlercode, below. From what I can tell, the processor automatically enters eminterruptem mode this assembly switches to emsupervisorem mode before branching to a C function depending on which interrupt line was triggered.

And thats all that I know.  Am I calling this all correctly.  I am more familiar with Objective C and .Net.  Is there anything else I need to do to convert the value given into a proper numeric value.p  pNow, if I have that correct, then perhaps someone might be able to tell me why this doesnt work in my codep  precode If scaleFactor gt 0 then       transform  GeomTransformation.new[scaleFactor, scaleFactor, scaleFactor]       model.entities.transformentitiestransform, model.entities  end codepre  pThanksp

Negative 1235 pI have a security DVR that uses h264 streams.  I have been trying to get this to work with zoneminder.  I have successfully logged into the dvr and recieved some form of data streams.  The data stream is dumped to a fifopipe, and then zoneminder uses ffmpeg to read this in. p  pNote  i know very very little about h.264 streams.  just enough to be stupid.p  pThe video only updates about every 15 seconds in ZM.  I can dump the stream to a file with ffmpeg or avconv avconv i tmpmypipe cam.mp4 but it is still not right.  However, the file created by avconv is WAY WAY better than the one created by ffmpeg.p  pIve included a link to the wireshark dump I did change the PW and login info, etc....  From the data, It appears that the dvr is adding a header to the h264 data streams.  I understand that the h264 stream starts with a 0x00 00 01 67 or 0x00 00 01 61.  Here is an example of the header plus start of streamp  precode0x33, 0x30, 0x64, 0x63, 0x48, 0x32, 0x36, 0x34,  0x3f, 0x55, 0x00, 0x00, 0x08, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00,  0xa2, 0x7a, 0xea, 0xdc, 0xcf, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00,  0x0d, 0x0a, 0x11, 0x07, 0x13, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00,  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x67, 0x42, 0xe0, 0x14,  0xdb, 0x05, 0x87, 0xc4, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01,  0x68, 0xce, 0x30, 0xa4, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  0x01, 0x06, 0xe5, 0x01, 0x51, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00,  0x00, 0x01, 0x65, 0xb8, 0x00, 0x01, 0xa8, 0xac, codepre  pI can see that there are a few frame indicators in this message.  The DVRs header appears to be 32 bytes long in this case, and in some other messages in the dump, it appears to be 24 bytes long.  I am striping the header off before I dump the stream to the pipe. I have verified the output doesnt include the dvrs headers in any way.p  pWhat I would like help with is determining what I should be sending to the pipe.  should I start with the first h.264 key  Is there something out of order  Im very surprised that ffmpeg is only getting 15 second updates, but avconv is much better lots of dropped frames, and playback is sped up.p  pusing ffmpeg to read the pipe produces a file that shows its codec as  H264  MPEG4 AVC part  10 avc1 with a Decoded format  Planar 420 YUV using vlc.  p  pAppreciate any help you can providep  pa hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu7515347MPouttest1chopped.pcap relnofollowWireshark h264 dumpap  pedit on Ubuntu 13.04 ffmpeg version   60.8.61ubuntu2 avconv 0.8.660.8.61ubuntu2p

Negative 1235 pI have a solution that inserts strings into an XHTML document and prints the results as Reports. My employer has asked if we could pull images off their SQL database stored as byte arrays to insert into the Reports. p  pI am using FlyingSaucer as the XHTML interpreter and Ive been using Java DOM to modify prestored reports that I have stored in the Report Generators package. p  pThe only solution I can think of at the moment is to construct the images, save them as a file, link the file in an img tag or backgroundimage in a constructed report, print the report and then delete the file. This seems really sloppy and I imagine it will be very time consuming. p  pI cant help but feel there must be a more elegant solution. Any suggestions for inserting a byte array into htmlp

Negative 1235 pi use colorbox jquery plugin with iframe on a related product link as i dont want people to leave the current product page but i still want a link to the related product, hencep  precode.iframe.colorboxiframetrue, width80, height80 codepre  popens yet another product page that detects that it is opened in a framep  precodeifwindow.parent.frames.length gt 0  ...some css changes here... codepre  pthe only clickable item in that frame is an Add to Cart button which adds the related product to cart. for this to happen the form submits to PHPSELF. means that page has to reload with the POST array. This works fine, but on click id like to close that frame, and reload the parent.p  precode    addtocartbutton.clickfunction      document.cartquantity.submit this would reload page in frame     parent..colorbox.close closing frame stops the submitreload     parent.window.location.reloadtrue parent reloads but nothing added to cart    codepre  pthis submits the form, closes the frame, and reloads the parent  but the submit did not have enough time to actually add to cart. is there a way i can send the POST data to the parent, close the frame, and reload the parent page with that extra datap
Negative 1235 pIm doing IPC using named FIFO pipes and I would like to coordinate that program can only write into the pipe when program reading the pipe has read the previously written data out from the pipe. So I would like to block the write until the the pipe is empty. Is this possiblep  pOne option that I though is that write function blocks when the pipe is full. But I would like to do this to much smaller amounts of data than the pipe size in Linux. E.g I would like that program can only write 20 bytes and then it waits until other end has read the data. I think you can not shrink named pipes to be so small. Minimum size seems to be page file size 4096 bytesp  pThanksp

Ive been following a tutorial from here a hrefhttpmikeyhogarth.wordpress.com20101009howtodeveloppongforandroid relnofollowhttpmikeyhogarth.wordpress.com20101009howtodeveloppongforandroida, but the tutorial had a fixed height and width to display the game. Ive been trying to modify the code to find the actual screen dimensions, and use those instead of the fixed settings. So the game will scale no matter the screen size. The GameState.java is where I put the getWidth and GetHeight. These two line were the original screen size lines from GameState.p  pOriginalp  precodescreen width and height     final int screenWidth  300     final int screenHeight  420     codepre  pModifiedp  precodescreen width and height     final int screenWidth  getWidthnull     final int screenHeight  getHeightnull codepre  pMainActivityp  precodeimport android.os.Bundle import android.app.Activity import android.view.Menu  public class MainActivity extends Activity   Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain       Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu       Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.     getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.main, menu     return true    codepre  pactivitymain.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltFrameLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidthfillparent androidlayoutheightfillparentgt ltcom.dbryant423.classicpong.GameView androidlayoutwidthfillparent androidlayoutheightfillparentgt ltFrameLayoutgt codepre  pGameView.javap  precodeimport android.content.Context import android.os.Handler import android.util.AttributeSet import android.view.KeyEvent import android.view.MotionEvent import android.view.SurfaceHolder import android.view.SurfaceView  public class GameView extends SurfaceView  implements SurfaceHolder.Callback  private GameThread thread  public GameViewContext context, AttributeSet attrs      supercontext, attrs      So we can listen for events...

Negative 1235 pI am working on the initial stages of an app and would like to employ the design implemented in lynda.coms app for iPad. My question is what design patterns are they using to create the Playlist table on the left hand side which flies in from the left when the scene appears Im guessing its a view with a tableview that is added as a subview to main screen. The reason Im trying to use something like this is to move away from the SplitView paradigm so I can have more screen realestate for the right hand side of the screen. See screen shot below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIvXiw.png altScreen Shot from Lynda.com Appp  pThanks.p

To do this, I had to expose each of the controls via a xName property, and raise the event once per each of these controls. I didnt see any difference from Bubble or Direct or Tunnel... so I am still a little confused on the eventing structure that WPF uses. p  pId prefer that EventTriggers listen on top level events and the top level control can be the publisher... It seems odd that I have to publish once per control that needs the EventTrigger to raise for that RoutedEvent.p  pStill trying to figure out the WPF way of doing things.p

Negative 1235 pSo I am working on a Tetris game as a school project in C. I got a little problem with the following situation. In Tetris when one completes a horizontal row, the row should be deleted and everything above the row should move down one place.The weird thing about my code is that when I place a block on the left or center of the board,the block stays there like it should. But when I place a block on the right side of the board, it is immediately deleted. I put my source code below so you can see what I am talking about.p  pFunction checkfory int ycheckup,int ypp  precode        ifycheckup1                      yp             return yp                  else ifycheckup0                      yp0             return yp          codepre  pMainp  precodeint BlockO[2][2]  1,1,1,1  int printb[8][4]  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 int saveb[8][4]   0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0   int x int y  int i  int xp  0 int yp  0 int ycheckup  0 int ch1 int ch2 int ytemp  int ycheck  0 int xcheck  2 while1       fory0ylt8y              forx0xlt4x                      ifyycheck ampamp xxcheck  yycheck1 ampamp xxcheck  yycheck ampamp xxcheck1  yycheck1 ampamp xxcheck1Looks for place to put block in                                      printf d ,xp                     printb[y][x]  BlockO[yp][xp]                     printfd, printb[y][x]                     ycheckup1                     xp                              else                                      printb[y][x]  saveb[y][x]                     printfd, printb[y][x]                     ycheckup0                                    checkycorycheck,printb         yp  checkforyycheckup, yp         xp0          printfn            fori0 ilt30000000 i Delay                        ycheck     systemcls      ifycheck7  printb[ycheck1][xcheck]  1  printb[ycheck1][xcheck1]  1  Checks for correlation              fory0ylt8y                      forx0xlt4x                              saveb[y][x]  printb[y][x]                         ifprintb[y][x]  1 ampamp printb[y][x1]  1 ampamp printb[y][x2]  1 ampamp printb[y][x3]  1 Checks for full row                                                      ytemp  y                             foryytempygt0y                                                              forx0xlt4x                                                                      ifygt0                                                                              saveb[y][x]  printb[y1][x] moves everything above deleted row, one row down                                                                           else                                                                              saveb[y][x]  0                                                                          printb[y][x]  saveb[y][x]                                                                                                                           ycheck0           if kbhit0                      ch1  getch             ch2  0             ch2  getch              switchch2                          case 75                     xcheck                 break left             case 77                     xcheck                 break             default                                  break                         codepre

Negative 1235 pMy question is not how to achieve that but what kind of approach is this. Im to maintain and if I can add new features to an existing web application which is about 67 years old and for first time I see such a thing which for me seems kind of ridiculous. p  pSo I have about 220 stored procedures, 70 user defined functions on the MS SQL 2008 Server and Im talking about relatively small to medium application. In the business logic there is not a single line of code containing codeSQLcode or something made to query and perform some kind of codeCRUDcode. In fact the idea is every query to the database to be performed using a stored procedure. p  pJust an example  this is a method from a class that is more than 10,000 rows, as it seems its used to call a stored procedurep  precodepublic static int GridViewAddparam1, param2..the names are changed                SqlConnection myConnection  GetSqlConnection         SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter  GetSqlDataAdapterSPprocName, myConnection           Set the parameters of the stored procedure          myDataAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters.Addnew SqlParameterName, SqlDbType.NVarChar, 50         myDataAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters[Name].Value  name          more parameters..          myConnection.Open         try                      myDataAdapter.SelectCommand.ExecuteNonQuery             result  Convert.ToInt32myDataAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters[ID].Value                  catch SqlException sqlex                      throw new ExceptionSqlErrors.InterpretErrorsqlex.Message                  catch Exception ex                      throw ex                  finally                      myDataAdapter.Dispose             myConnection.Close                  return result       codepre  pIn my database inside codeprogrammabilitycode  codeStored Procedurescode I have a stored procedure with this name so I guess this is how I call the procedure from inside my code in Visual Studio 2012.p  pHowever I dont have a lot of experience as programmer at all and the whole time Ive been using codeEntity Frameworkcode mostly with codeCode Firstcode workflow and now this looks like a huge mess to me.

But still can you help me with identifying exactly what is this approach if additional info is needed please ask, and maybe some guidelines andor articles about using it because right now I see the code but I definitely have difficulties understanding how the things are happening I mean creating a new querysp, calling it from my code, do I need to know codeTSQLcode in order to write correctly my sp or as its said in the article above I can write standard C methods and leave the CLR take care for the rest.. and all the stuff that would help me to understand how exactly am I supposed to work having this legacy and being allowed only to build upon it but not changing the conception.p

Negative 1235 pIm loadstress testing using Visual Studios load testing project with current users set quite low at 10. The application makes multiple System.Net.Http.HttpClient request to a WebAPI service layerapplication which in some cases calls another WebApi layerapplication and its only getting around 30 requestsecond when testing a single MVC4 controller not parsing dependent requests. p  pThese figures are based on a sample project where no real code is executed at any of the layers other then HttpClient calls and to contruct a new collection of Models to return so some serialization happening too as part of WebApi. Ive tried both with async controller and without and the results seemed pretty similar slight improvement with async controllersp  pCaching the calls obviously increases it dramatically to around 400 RPS although the nature of the data and the traffic means that a significant amount of the calls wouldnt be cached in real world scenarios. p  pIs HttpClient or HTTP layer in general simply too expensive or are there some ideas you have around getting higher throughputp  pIt might be worth noting that on my local development machine this load test also maxes out the CPU.

Negative 1235 pI am using MATLAB to write a code that multiplies polynomials. Most parts of my code work however there is one part where I have two row vectors codeacode and codebcode. I want to remove repeated elements of codeacode and then add the corresponding elements of codebcode. This is what I have writtenp  precodeclengtha dlengthb remove[] for i1c     for ji1c         if aiaj             remove[remove,i]             bjbibj         end     end end aremove[] bremove[] codepre  pThe problem with this is if there is an element in a that appears more than twice, it doesnt work properly. For example if codea[5,6,8,9,6,7,9,10,8,9,11,12]code and codeb[1,7,1,1,3,21,3,3,4,28,4,4]code then once this code is run codeacode becomes code[5,6,7,10,8,9,11,12]code which is correct but codebcode becomes code[1,10,21,3,3,27,4,4]code which is correct except the 27 should be a 26.p  pI know why this happens because the 9 in codea1,4code gets compared with the 9 in codea1,7code so codeb1,7code becomes codeb1,7b1,4code and then codea1,4code gets compared with the 9 in codea1,10code. and then later the codea1,7code compares with codea1,10code and so the new codeb1,7code adds to the codeb1,10code however the codeb1,4code adds to the codeb1,10code too. I somehow need to stop this once one repeated element has been found because here codeb1,4code has been added twice when it should only be added once. I am not supposed to use any built in functions, is there a way of resolving this easilyp

Negative 1235 pIm wondering if a WebRTC program can run from a platform like a hrefhttppeersm.compeersm relnofollowhttppeersm.compeersma in its own private space or private origin domain...  This would mean that one could simply upload, host, and use a p2p program using only there browser.p  pFor example, if a WebRTC program were packaged into a single codehtmlcode file and provided to the peersm network, a file hash could be obtained and shared.  Another user may then open that file hash and see the codehtmlcode file rendered as html under a url that looks like this codeblobd6ff3420cfd54f2a966a568fb0c6c381code...  This works now for simple html. p  pWhat Im not sure about is  Would WebRTC and local storage then make use of that URL as its own origin  So, would multiple users be able to find each other webrtc, would they be able to then save data in local storage html5localstorage  That network and data would then be private from peersms data.p

Ive changed the name a bunch of times to other names to check and it only seems to be on the particular word archives which it turns into archife.

Can we not use the table name folders because theres some problem with it Its the only name Ive come across apart from pages which you cant use as a table name because it clashes.p  pAnd, why does cake bake the table archives to the model archifep

So I implement the delegate methodp  precode voiddocumentInteractionControllerUIDocumentInteractionController controller willBeginSendingToApplicationNSString application    if [application isEqualToStringcom.burbn.instagram]       NSURL newPath       NSString oldPathStr  [controller.URL absoluteString]      NSString newPathStr  [oldPathStr stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfStringig withStringjpg]      newPath  [NSURL URLWithStringnewPathStr]       controller.URL  newPath      controller.UTI  public.jpeg   codepre  pThat way if the app is not Instagram I could share the other version of the file in jpg I have both .ig and .jpg versions stored in disk.  p  pBut, the problem is that DocumentInteractionController doesnt call this delegate method when I am trying to share the picture with the system apps like Mail, Messages, Twitter or Facebook so I couldt use the jpg URL and people receive a .ig file in their iPhones or laptops that they dont know how to open. If I try to open other apps like Whatsapp there isnt any problem and the delegate is called.p  pDo you know how could I take control of this before the system open the mail composer, message composer or social composerp  pThank you so much.p

Negative 1235 pWhen writting RCP Plugins it often happens that i need to declare and reference IDs in the extension specification i.e. in the codeplugin.xmlcode and also in my java code. When I change one of those, I also have to change the duplicate.p  pIm not sure if the problem is already that the same IDs must be used in the code emandem the plugin declaration, but thats how the eclipse plugin templates do it.

This does not happen when dragging item from lower list and dropping on to upper one.p  pMy understanding is that the HTML from top panel is just hidden by the scrollable panel but the javascript still captures events on the same DOM. This behavior does not change even if I make the droppable greedy as the event is captured by the top list. Setting Zindex also did not help me either.p  pOne of the option is to check if the droppable is visible in view port but in my actual project, I am using knockout binding and adding this functionality will make my code difficult to manage.p  pIs there any way to solve this by use of HTML, CSS or some quick JS functionp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1235 pI have a file in which the data is stored in columns with a header above and marker points in between.

Negative 1235 pSo I have a div that when you hover over it its supposed to trigger an animation that moves another div a bit, increases its height, and then changes the HTML content inside that div, on hover out this process is reverted.

Thats why the application is not initialized. It seems that the problem is the classes that weblogic scans while looking for codeWebApplicationInitializercode. In 12.1.2, the same method and same application receives 6 classes, 4 of them are abstract they belong to spring and 2 of then are my own clases.p  pI have considered to use a web.xml to avoid the problem, but I would like to solve it. Any solution Thanksp  pI dont know if its been a good idea to upgrade. First day, first problem. What could I discover next monthsp

However, I dont need a 2d array to do this because Im only looking at possible moves from only the side. Heres something I drew up to hopefully explain my process. img srchttpi.imgur.comKS7TjGk.jpg altMy Methodp  pSo for a 1x1. Like you said, once you reach the limit of one direction, you can only travel in the limit of the other, so theres 2 ways. This isnt particularly helpful for a 1x1 but it is for larger ones. For a 2x2, you know that the top corner, being the limit of right, only has 1 possible path from that point. The same logic applies to the bottom corner. And, because you have a square which you have already solved for, a 1x1, you know that the middle point has 2 paths from there. Now, if you look at the sides, you see that the point for instance that has 2 beneath it and 1 to the right has the sum of the number of paths in those adjacent points so then that point must have 3 paths. Same for the other side, giving the top left corner the sum of 3 and 3, or 2 times 3.p  pNow if you look at my code, thats what its trying to do. The element with index 0 is always 1, and for the rest of the array, it adds together the previous term and itself and replaces the current term. Lastly, to find the total number of paths, it just doubles the last number. So if the program were to try and solve for a 4x4, the array would currently look like 1, 4, 10, 20. So the program would change it to 1, 5, 10, 20, then 1, 5, 15, 20, then 1, 5, 15, 35, and finally, adds the total number of paths, 1, 5, 15, 35, 70. I think this is what you were trying to explain to me in your answer however my answer always comes out incorrect.p

Negative 1235 pI have a group of users that supported the app I am developing via Kickstarter, who have already prepurchased the game. Id like to offer those users the game for free and figured that releasing a free version of the game privately for them would be the best solution.

That is, is there a way to have an application be private and free to a select group of users while also having a public, paid version of the appp

Negative 1235 pA question on secuity. I want to allow nonroot users to deploy containers on say a cluster, Id be concerned if they could mount host directories and then escalate to root privileges inside the container. I gather from the articles below that the feature for mapping a containerrootuser to a hostnonrootuser is still in the ether The article itself seems to be relatively old, Im curious to know how developed these features are.p  blockquote   pRecent improvements in Linux namespaces will soon allow to run   fullfeatured containers without root privileges, thanks to the new   user namespace. This is covered in detail here. Moreover, this will   solve the problem caused by sharing filesystems between host and   guest, since the user namespace allows users within containers   including the root user to be mapped to other users in the host   system.p      pThe end goal for Docker is therefore to implement two additional   security improvementsp      p1 map the root user of a container to a nonroot user of the Docker   host, to mitigate the effects of a containertohost privilege   escalation p      p2 allow the Docker daemon to run without root privileges,   and delegate operations requiring those privileges to wellaudited   subprocesses, each with its own very limited scope virtual network   setup, filesystem management, etc.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpsdocs.docker.comarticlessecurity relnofollowhttpsdocs.docker.comarticlessecuritya a hrefhttpblog.docker.com201308containersdockerhowsecurearethey relnofollowhttpblog.docker.com201308containersdockerhowsecurearetheyap

I then removed the codeonclickcode, assigned an ID to the submit button, and tried codeupdatepassword.onclick, function  ... code but this wasnt recognised at all.p  pThe culprit in all of this is almost definitely the Bootstrap modal, and Im guessing its got something to do with how the browser handles it upon page load. p  pp  pstrongModalstrongp  precodelt Modal gt ltdiv classmodal fade idchangePasswordModal tabindex1 roledialog arialabelledbychangePassModalLabel ariahiddentruegt     ltdiv classmodaldialoggt         ltdiv classmodalcontentgt             ltdiv classmodalheadergt                 ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissmodalgtltspan ariahiddentruegtamptimesltspangtltspan classsronlygtCloseltspangtltbuttongt                 lth4 classmodaltitle idchangePassModalLabelgtChange Passwordlth4gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classmodalbodygt                 ltdiv classcolmd12gt                     ltdiv classalert alertpassword styledisplay nonegt                         ltpgtltpgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltform roleform action methodpostgt                     ltdiv classformgroupgt                         ltlabel forpasswordcurrentgtCurrent Passwordltspangtltspangtltlabelgt                         ltinput typepassword classformcontrol idpasswordcurrent namepasscurr placeholderCurrent password...gt                     ltdivgt                     lthrgt                     ltdiv classrowgt                         ltdiv classcolmd6gt                             ltdiv classformgroupgt                                 ltlabel forpasswordnewgtNew Passwordltspangtltspangtltlabelgt                                 ltinput typepassword classformcontrol idpasswordnew namepassnew placeholderNew password...gt                             ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                         ltdiv classcolmd6gt                             ltdiv classformgroupgt                                 ltlabel forpasswordnewconfgtConfirm New Passwordltspangtltspangtltlabelgt                                 ltinput typepassword classformcontrol idpasswordnewconf namepassnewc placeholderConfirm new password...gt                             ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltformgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classmodalfootergt                 ltbutton typebutton classbtn btndefault datadismissmodalgtCancelltbuttongt                 ltbutton typebutton classbtn btnprimary onclickupdatePasswordgtUpdate Passwordltbuttongt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongScriptstrongp  precodeltscriptgt     function updatePassword         console.logfoo         .ajax             url urlajaxupdatepassword,             data passcurr  passcurr, passnew  passnew, passnewc  passnewc,             async false,             success functiondata               ,             error functiondata                  alertpassword.removeClassalertsuccess.addClassalertdanger.htmlltpgtltstronggtSorry, an error occurredltstronggtltpgtltpgtdata.additionalltpgt.slideDown200, function                      alertpassword.delay4000.slideUp200                                             ltscriptgt codepre  pemMy apologies if this has been asked before.

with many other things on every few lines of the file.p  pThe header that contains this code is included in many places. I know Im violating the One Definition Rule, which is why Im using the Template Constant Trick, but I think I need to violate the ODR as my goal is to have an easy to use Macro based typesafe replacement for C enums.p  pIm not sure if its the violation of ODR that is the cause of my issues, or something else. I tried declspecselectany but it didnt seem to help  and I would prefer if this macro would be eventually crossplatform, because if it works out, I have other projects I would use it in.p  pEither way, the .cpp files etc that make use of the enum are able to, and intellisense correctly suggests the options.p  pHowever, on a possibly related note, if I dont preexpand the macro, intellisense isnt able to parse it and it doesnt know what a codeItemCategorycode is at all, even though it compiles and works fine.p  pI just want my intellisense to work properly with my typesafe enums  it slows down intellisense and confuses it in other code in the same project.p

Negative 1235 pIm working on adding a feature to the Android platform to play a sound from the speaker with the absolute lowest latency possible. I found codetinyplay.ccode in the codetinyalsacode external project and I am using that as a model. I want to open the pcm device and play a sound and close it within 10 ms if possible.p  pRight now when I call codepcmparamsgetcode or codepcmopencode it will sometimes take only a few millis, but sometimes it takes up to 4 seconds I believe that if an android sound has played recently it takes longer. If I open well in advance and then use codepcmwritecode the audio plays very quickly, in just a couple millis. How can I guarantee a faster codepcmopencode time so I can get to playing sooner Is there some method to force it to open faster in some way I dont mind if I have to open it up to a couple hundred millis in advance, but 4 seconds is way too long.p  pI realize that while I have this open I am monopolizing the audio driver, that is totally fine. I just dont want to monopolize it forever.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI have modified AudioFlinger to not standby and that eliminated the codepcmopencode slowness.

Negative 1235 pI have a dynamic setup of buttons that automatically adjust in width and height based on auto layout constraints set up in a storyboard. When in portrait the buttons have equal widths and heights so the frame is perfectly square, and when the device is rotated to landscape the buttons get shorter and wider. I have set codecornerRadiuscode on the buttons layers so theyre perfectly circular when in portrait and that works well, but when I rotate to landscape the corner radius doesnt look right anymore obviously. I need to change that so it becomes an oval. The problem is, no matter where I try to put that code, I cannot get the correct width and height the buttons will be after the rotation occurs. I want this to occur while the device is being rotated  dont want to wait until the rotation has completed. Ideally the codecornerRadiuscode would animate the change while the transition animates.p  pIf I use codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode or codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode, it correctly gets the button frame when the app is launched, but upon rotating to landscape this method is called before the buttons frame is updated for the new orientation, so I cant calculate the correct corner radius.p  pIf I use codeviewWillTransitionToSizewithTransitionCoordinatorcode or codewillTransitionToTraitCollectionwithTransitionCoordinatorcode or codewillRotateToInterfaceOrientationcode, it doesnt get called when the app is launched, and upon rotating the device it is called before the frame is updated for the new size.p  pIf I use codewillAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientationcode, it doesnt get called when the app is launched, but upon rotating the device it does correctly get the new button frame. But this method is deprecated.p  pstrongSo the question is, what method can you use to set the properties of a button based on the size the button will be when rotation has completed, that is called before the rotation has completedstrong p  pNote that it needs to be called for every orientation change, not just size class changes rotating iPad doesnt change the size class. I only need to support iOS 8.0.p  pThis is the code Im placing in the methods to know if it is getting the correct sizep  precodeprintlnbutton.frame.size.width x button.frame.size.height codepre

Since its already in production I wanted to install two versions on my device the App Store Version and the Development version.p  pI followed this a hrefhttpblog.chrismiles.info201104iosdevbetaproductionbuilds.html relnofollowinstructionsa and successfully installed two versions of the app, but when trying to Log in using Facebook I got a problem because the development version bundleID com.company.app.dev does not matches the registered one on my Facebook App com.company.app.p  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsiostroubleshootingsharedappid relnofollowThis guidea shows how to share the same facebook appID between apps. The guide is quite confusing to me. I registered the two bundle ids com.company.app.dev and com.company.app and one URL scheme suffix dev, and modified mi App.plist file to include the codeFacebookUrlSchemeSuffixcode key.p  pThat lead me into another problem, when I logged into the production app, the callback was opening the development app, because both apps had the same URL callbacks registered fbxxxx and fbxxxxdev, where xxxx is my facebook app id.p  pI solved it registering a userdefined build setting that adds the codeFacebookUrlSchemeSuffixcode when in Build mode and not in Release mode, and also modifying the URL schemes in the App.plist file to append the suffix in the same case.p  pBut this solution seems a bit hacky since it does now follow the Facebook guides. Is there any better solution to this I think Im not following the Facebook guide correctly.p

Negative 1235 pI need to know if someone has already designed a finite state machine that models the behavior of the keys in a keyboard. I guess text editors must use something like this. Ive been looking for such an fsm, but I havent found anything. Probably it has a special name or something that would help me find it. I would really appreciate it if you could give me more information about this fact.p  pTo clarify, what I need is a fsm that, for example, whenever a shift press arrives, then I go to other state in which it is valid that a shift release arrives or possibly a down arrow press and then the respective releases.p  pThe possibilities and combinations are a lot for the common keys in a keyboard such as ctrl, shift, mayus, and so on. So it would be useful to see one to check for any mistakes in mine.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1235 pI am working on a x86 disassembler for educational purposes. I have been using nasm for assembling different instructions.p  pCurrently I am looking into the 16bit addressing forms with the ModRM byte. The Intel 64 and IA32 Architectures Software Developers Manual Volume 2A Instruction Set Reference, AM I think my version is outdated but this information should still hold true states that The default segment register is SS for the effective addresses containing a BP index, DS for other effective addresses.p  pSo if I understand this correctly, the following instructions should do exactly the samep  precodemov [bx], eax mov [dsbx], eax codepre  pHowever, when I compile the above instructions using nasm and look at the bytes generated, I get the followingp  precode67 89 07      mov [bx], eax 3e 67 89 07   mov [dsbx], eax codepre  pI understand the meaning of all the bytes, but I do not understand why nasm would add a ds segment override prefix 3e to the second instruction. It seems unnecessary to me since ds already is the default segment.p  pMy question is am I missing something here or is the ds segment override prefix not neededp

Negative 1235 pI have an Arduino Bluetooth shield HC05. I paired the Bluetooth shield first with Android device and tried to send data to Arduino via Bluetooth shield. Android app sends data to the shield. But Arduino not receiving the command more than 4 to 13 times I think my app not holding the connection properly with the Bluetooth shield, I am not sure about the problem. I tried with the same Arduino code with some other Android application. It was working well. So problem is in my code only. I am using log to monitor the flow of code. The data is sending from the Android device and the Bluetooth is live and still paired. I think Bluetooth shield was not receiving or it was receiving and not passing the data to Arduino. I am troubling for couple of weeks.p  pThanks in Advance p  pMy code goes here...p  precodeprivate BluetoothAdapter mBluetoothAdapter  null private BluetoothSocket btSocket  null private OutputStream

Shouldnt I rather subclass QGLWidget and reimplement drawBackground there Or the QGraphicsView will automatically switch to openGL and apply rendering algorithms to all items in QGraphicsScene and backgrounds even if in my QGraphicsScene reimplemented drawBackground function Im using QPainterp  pMy present drawBackground function looks something like thisp  precodevoid radarScenedrawBackgroundQPainter painter, const QRectF amprect          .....          int detailedGridSize  20          left  intrect.left  intrect.left  detailedGridSize         top  intrect.top  intrect.top  detailedGridSize          QVarLengthArrayltQLineF, 500gt detailedLines          for qreal x  left x lt rect.right x  detailedGridSize             detailedLines.appendQLineFx, rect.top, x, rect.bottom          for qreal y  top y lt rect.bottom y  detailedGridSize             detailedLines.appendQLineFrect.left, y, rect.right, y          settingsMutexgtlock         paintergtsetPenQPenQBrushsettingsgtgetGridThreeColor, 0.5, QtDotLine, QtRoundCap, QtRoundJoin         settingsMutexgtunlock          paintergtdrawLinesdetailedLines.data, detailedLines.size          ....  codepre

Negative 1235 pSo I realize I may be asking a lot out of a nonfinished version of opencv, but Im having strange issues with the cvtColor method that I cant find any other references to people having elsewhere. First, as some prefacing, Im writing a multithreaded gui application using PyQt4, QThreads, Python 2.7, and opencv on the beaglebone black. My current source can be found on github a hrefhttpsgithub.comSARLEngineeringPCApplicationstreemasterPickAndPlate relnofollowHEREa. I was originally using the debian repo version of opencv but it turned out to be so outdated that it didnt have some of the features I was looking for, namely the simpleblobdetector class, and was extremely slow. With that in mind, I compiled the latest opencv 3.0.0 from scratch and ever since then its been acting strange. I eventually narrowed it down to an issue with cvtColor. I then simplified it to bare minimum code to make sure it wasnt something else causing the issue. Heres what I have that Ive been using for testing.p  precodeimport cv2  img  cv2.imreadimagesoriginalimage.png, cv2.IMREADCOLOR  rgbimg  cv2.cvtColorimg, cv2.COLORBGR2RGB grayimg  cv2.cvtColorimg, cv2.COLORBGR2GRAY bgrimg  cv2.cvtColorrgbimg, cv2.COLORRGB2BGR  cv2.imwriteimagesafterconverttorgb.png, rgbimg cv2.imwriteimagesafterconverttogray.png, grayimg cv2.imwriteimagesafterconvertbacktobgr.png, bgrimg codepre  pThe resulting images from this code can be found a hrefhttpsimgur.comaHvU6o relnofollowHEREa.p  pNeedless to say, Im stumped at this point. I find it particularly weird that the conversion to gray works perfectly while the other two dont work at all. Ive had a couple of my friends who work with opencv check both my original code and this test code and cant see anything wrong with it. Also, though not as part of this test code, I did try reading in different file formats and images from a variety of sources. It also does the same thing manipulating an opencv frame received from the VideoCapture class as thats where I first saw the issue and what Im ultimately trying to do. p  pSo has anyone witnessed something like this before in opencv 3.0 Am I better off just custom compiling opencv 2.4 and using that instead I would have done that in the first place, but I was following guides on custom compiling opencv for the beaglebone black in particular and they all used the latest 3.0 so I figured it would be fine. Anyway, figured itd be worth checking before I do the compilation process again as its tended to take me a couple of days to get it right with it doing so overnight.p  pEDIT Just in case anyone else goes looking and wants to know what I found out. It is definitely a bug in the release candidate of opencv 3.0 that I downloaded. I wasnt able to find a fix for that version and ultimately had to downgrade to version 2.4.10. Since the downgrade, everything is now working fine.p
Negative 1235 pI need to include some important files in my executable, when I compile, my project images are included but TXT files not. So far I used this codep  pFile TXTfile  new FilegetClass.getResourceTXTfile.txt.getPathp  pWhere TXT is the package where the file lies, and file.txt being the file it self.p  pInside netbeans works perfectly but when I compile it and run the build jar executable, it throws a file not found error. Ive made some research and most people say that the solution is build a Fat Jar, but I have not idea in how to do this. Im sorry for my english.p

Negative 1235 pMy question is on the scheduling of thread blocks in CUDA specifically kepler or newer nvidia architectures after execution of a kernel has already begun.p  pFrom my understanding of the kepler architecture which may be incorrect there is a limit to the number of active blocks which can be scheduled to a single SM at any moment in time 16 blocks if I am remembering correctly. Also from my understanding blocks cannot move once they are scheduled to run on a specific SM. p  pWhat I am curious about is the block scheduling and execution behavior after the initial selection of blocks takes place and have begun executing on the device assuming that a kernel has more thread blocks than can be active in all SMs. p  pAre new blocks executed as soon as a single currently running active block completes in a SM  Or is the next set of blocks executed only after a SM completes all of its currently active blocks  Or are they started only after all SMs complete all currently active blocks executingp  pIn addition I have heard that block scheduling is fixed to a single SM.

Negative 1235 pI am using Java  Jblas first time user and am trying to multiply two matrices. One is a 163x4 and the other is 4x1 matrix. I would expect the result of such a multiplication to be a 163x1 matrix. However usingp  precodeFloatMatrix a  b.mmulic codepre  pI am getting the errorp  blockquote   pMatrices must have same length is 652 and 4p blockquote  pNow while I assume, that makes perfect sense for the program I am confused. The same multiplication worked fine in Octave which of course applies some magic. But now for getting this to work I would need to know what kind of sorcery this isp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo here is what the Octave Documentation says about broadcasting the sorceryp  blockquote   pIn case all dimensions are equal, no broadcasting occurs and ordinary   elementbyelement arithmetic takes place. For arrays of higher   dimensions, if the number of dimensions isnt the same, then missing   trailing dimensions are treated as 1. When one of the dimensions is 1,   the array with that singleton dimension gets copied along that   dimension until it matches the dimension of the other array.p blockquote  pSo this means I just copy the 4x1 matrix 163 times. Then I can execute the multiplication, but instead of the 163x1 matrix I wanted, I now have a 163x4 matrix. Which for me is strange. What is my solution nowp

Negative 1235 pI have a batch file that adds finished jobs to a basic text file to create a logs .txt files.

The index has a meta httpequivrefresh for every 15 seconds.  The problem Im running into is because the scheduled batch file is constantly overriding the Queue.html, the index.html will try to refresh while the page is being overwritten and will display a page not found error HTTP 403.  Because I have this iframed and auto refreshing the error will go away after 15 seconds.  However, it doesnt make for a very clean page at times since I leave the page open to monitor the queue.  My knowledge of CSS and databases is very limited so Im just curious if there are any simple recommendations on getting this page to refresh a little cleaner.  p  pThanks,p

Negative 1235 pstrongInformationstrong We have a 3rd party application we use for production at our company. This program uses a DSN to connect up to our SQL Server 2012 database through ODBC. This application works properly under Server 2003 MADC 2.8 however when i bring it to Server 2008 x86 DAC 6.0 i am getting a connection failed with Microsoft OLE DB Provider SQL Server Login failed for user XXX. I have a feeling this is due to the default of persist security info changing from True to False on Windows servers starting with server 2008 and greater Change made in DAC 6.0. I do not have access to changing the connection string inside the application as it is 3rd party. as seen in this a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combdataaccesstechnologiesarchive20100528whyismyconnectionstringincorrect.aspxarticle ap  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there any way to change ADO.Nets behavior so that this value is defaulted to True rather than False outside of the connection string. I would like to be able to at least prove or disprove that this is the feature causing the issue. p  pstrongNotestrong I realize this is a huge security issue tampering with this setting and we will be taking the correct precautions if it is changed to ensure the server and application are isolated.p  pstrongSolutionstrong Provided by William below. If you are updating your SQL Server 3rd party application From Server 2003 to Server 2008 and you are getting a connection like above where on 2003 you did not, set the password for the SQL account to blank temporarily or in staging only, this is very dangerous to leave blank in production to test if the application works again when a blank password is provided. If it does then the application is not setting the Persist Security Info in the connection string and the value that was defaulting to true now defaults to false. Your application may be limited to use under server 2003 and may not function properly on server 2008. There is no way that i could find to get the value to default back to true. p

Negative 1235 pI am making a website for a local bakery and would like to put a facebook like button on the homepage. I went to developers.facebook and copied and pasted the code.

Then you copy a special div wherever you want. I did this but the like button refuses to render on the screen. It seems like maybe the browser chrome, firefox, opera takes some extra time loading it but it just doesnt appear. I think either Im missing something obvious like Im not putting it in the right place the css is messing it up or facebooks like button just stopped working. For the record, correct me if Im wrong but this likes any url not just a facebook page, right If you can help me I will be eternally grateful Also, are there any other social media buttons besides twitter where you dont actually need to have a  page for it to work Thanks againp
Negative 1235 pI have configured jquery to include the cookie header with each requestp  precode.ajaxSetup     cache false,     xhrFields          withCredentials true       codepre  pOn the serverside, I run Node with Express. Sessions are managed with the expresssessions middleware and the Mongostore plugin.p  pBefore adding the xhrFields configuration, I noticed that for each request, a new session was stored in the database. I inspected the request headers and noticed that no cookie header was present.p  pAfter configuring ajax as above, I notice that still there are too many sessions stored on the serverside.p  pThe problem is the OPTIONS request emitted by Backbone. I checked the headers of this request and there is no session information included in these requests. Since no Session id is sent to the server, the server creates and stores a new one. It also tries to set a new cookie on the client, which will change the clients session id.p  pI see two optionsp  ol liConfigure ajax somehow to send the cookie info on ALL requests.li liDisable the session middleware on the option routes which means I will have to include the middleware on all routes that require the session and NOT include it in all other routes.li ol  pI will implement the latter.

Negative 1235 pI want to create a reusable grunt build. The way im doing this now is by creating an npm package for a module called mygenericbuild and publish it in our registry. The mygenericbuild module has a lot of dependencies to grunt modules like gruntcontribclean. On the consuming side I refer to it as a dev dependency in the package.json.p  precodedevDependencies   mygenericbuild 0.0.1  codepre  pIn my Gruntfile.js file on the consuming side I require the generic build and using itp  precodemodule.exports  functiongrunt   requiremygenericbuildgrunt  codepre  pThis works fine. The only issue is that I want the my consuming devDependency list to be empty except for the mygenericbuild dependency. If I leave it out I simply leave them out I get this errorp  precode grunt gtgt Local Npm module gruntcontribclean not found. Is it installed codepre  pThis is understandable since it will look for my npm modules in my local nodemodules folder, which is empty apart from the mygenericbuild module.p  pThe way Im solving this issue now is by replacing dependencies with peerDependencies in the mygenericbuild module. This will ensure that all the dependencies are installed right next to the mygenericbuild module. This works like a charm and all my problems are solved... except i get this warning when using npm install on my consuming module.p  precodenpm WARN peerDependencies The peer dependency gruntcontribcleangt1.0.0 included from mygenericbuild will no npm WARN peerDependencies longer be automatically installed to fulfill the peerDependency npm WARN peerDependencies in npm 3. Your application will need to depend on it explicitly. codepre  pSo this solution will no longer work in npm v3. This gives me the feeling that im miss using a feature. Is there an other way to group the dependencies Or can use the dependencies of mygenericbuild some other way Ive got the feeling that Im making things more complicated than they need to be.p

Negative 1235 pIm diving into GameplayKit with Spritekit and from what I gather, you subclass codeGKEntitycode and then start adding codeGKComponentscode to that entity.  The entity would more or less just be a bag of components that fill some function.p  pThe part Im confused about is communication between components.  How do you keep them decoupled.  For example, lets say I have a codeHealthComponentcode class, and I add that component to a codePlayerEntitycode, and an codeEnemyEntitycode.   I also have a codeHealthBarComponentcode strongbut I only want a health bar to appear above the playerstrong.  When the player takes damage, that information needs to be updated in the codeHealthBarComponentcode.  p  pSo how should that information be sent  I see there is a class called codeGKComponentSystemcode in the documentation.  Im not 100 on how that should be used.p  pAnother question is.. when the players health reaches zero he should regenerate while the enemy should stay dead.  When the player runs out of lives, the game ends.  p  pThe health system for both an enemy and player would be roughly the same, but the events around death would be totally different for each.  Im not following how to use a component system while keeping the unique behavior of each entity.p  psome pseudocode would be greatp

Negative 1235 pIs it possible to use the Haswell CPU feature PEBS Precise Event Based Sampling directly from a Linux userspace process instead of using a kernel interfacep  pI have succeeded in accessing performance counters from userspace using the RDPMC instruction and only using the kernel for WRMSR. This makes me very happy.p  pNow I want to also access PEBS. To do this I need to use the MSR IA32DSAREA to supply a debug store memory area. However, I am not sure how to allocate this memory and what address I need to use. I can allocate 2MB of contiguous physical memory Linux HugeTLB with mlock. I can also resolve the physical address of this memory via procfs. However, I am not sure whether either the virtual or physical address is suitable as the linear address to supply for the MSR. My concern is that the address may have to be in the kernels virtual address space that I dont have access to.p  pHow can I prepare suitable memory for IA32DSAREA and logging PEBS events without writing a custom kernel modulep
