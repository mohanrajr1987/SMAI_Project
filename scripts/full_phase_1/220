Their client secrets are 20 numbers or less.p  pGoogles client IDs are over 40 characters, their client secrets are 24 characters or so. p  pAccording to the Oauth spec, the client id is not meant to be kept secret, so youd have to assume it is as public as a username. p  pMy question is, shouldnt the client secrets be longer so theyre harder to guess vs. the ids Especially with the clientcredentials grant type, which only requires a client id and secret  wouldnt shorter client secrets with known character sets make it much easier to perform brute force attacks if someone got a hold of a client id, or am I missing something herep  pNote, I understand that in a real production scenario, you could mitigate this risk in quite a few ways  requiring multi factor authentication, or disabling accounts after too many invalid attempts for example.

Positive 220 pstrongem[This question has nothing to do with login credentials, or the userplayer inputting any kind of passphrase, etc thank you and keep reading.]emstrongp  pFirst off, my question has already sort of been asked, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4155187securingapasswordinsourcecodeherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12146340hidepasswordincsharpsourcecodeherea. My question is different than either of these though, because I am not connecting through the internet to get data or concerned with any type of logging in. To put this as simply as I can, I am making a game, and my games resources are all encrypted into a proprietary format, which takes a single password to decrypt the data. I have to hide that password in the source code. I cant think of any other way than to keep the password within the application itself. Encrypting the password within another file would still take a password, and that just starts this endless circle of where to hide that password, and so on.p  pstrongThis got me wondering, how do modern games handle their resource decryption passwordsstrong Think of games like Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls, Grand Theft Auto, etc. They encrypt their data, right So that means that they need a passwordsaltetc to decrypt it. Such a password would also need to be within the executable, too. strongSo where do they hide it How do they obfuscate itstrongp  pI considered one option, which seems like it would actually be pretty good. Basically, I would construct a method which would run through some bizzare gauntlet of mathmatical computations, construct a string, and return the data to serve as the password. Someone could just rip the method out of the code and then launch it in their own private app, but at least it wouldnt be so blatant as p  precodepublic const string ResourceDecryptionPassword  MYAWESOMEDECRYPTIONPASSWORD codepre  pAlso, I considered just keeping the password as a large hardcoded array of bytes, which I could convert back to a string during application start.p  pCan anyone suggest any other solutions to this problemp  pAlso, and I forgot to mention the source code of my game will be obufsicated.

Positive 220 pI have to implement De La Brandais Trie from scratch and add all the words to the trie from a dictionary.txt file which contains 500 words, one wordline. Eventually I need to make the trie like a password checking thing. User is allowed to input a 5 character long password, and I need to check the entire trie to see if their input is included, if it is then its a bad password I will ask them to provide another one. If not, then its a good password, my job is done. p  pBut right now Im having trouble with the Node class when I test the add method. Im really confused because Eclipse tells me that it cant find dictionary.txt but when I ran on terminal it tells me Exception in thread main codejava.lang.NullPointerExceptioncode at DLBNode.access400DLB.java168. p  pWhy am I getting different error messages And how can i fix this p  pIf you can also help me with the search method it would be fantastic.

Positive 220 pIm new to python and Im having a problem. I need to check a password on its upper, lower, numbers and symbols.

Positive 220 pThis one will be quick, I have to make a program that checks to see if a password is valid or not. It has to be atleast 8 characters, have one lower, one upper case char, and atleast one special char to be valid. Otherwise, the password will be invalid. Everything seems to be alright, however it doesnt seem to ever checkout as valid even when it is. I feel like it has to do with the character location or something but I cannot pin what it is exactly.

Negative 220 pI have around 4000 entities that I need to insert into a Java App Engine datastore.  As I understand it, only the Python version of App Engine currently has tools to upload data from a CSV file to a datastore.  So, what I have done thus far is follow the instructions at a hrefhttpcode.google.comappenginedocspythontoolsuploadingdata.html relnofollowhttpcode.google.comappenginedocspythontoolsuploadingdata.htmla and have successfully written my 4000 or so entities into my local datastore using Python.  I am only using Python for the sake of taking the entities from a .csv and writing them to the datastore.  I have verified that the entities are there by using the ahadmin address on my local host python version of app engine to see the data viewer.  p  pWhat I want to do now is to use those entities locally in my initial Java version.  Now, this is normally not a problem when the entities are uploaded using Python to the deployed version of App Engine, because different versions of the same project share the same datastore, regardless of runtime.  So, If I had been writing all the .csv rows to the deployed Python version of my app, my deployed Java version would be able to see all the entities uploaded through my Python version.  BUT, how do you achieve the same thing locallyp  pAs I understand it, the Java version of App Engine creates a local datastore in a .bin file in the WEBINF directory.  Does the Python version of App Engine create a similar .bin file somewhere that I could just copy over into my Java version  I havent even been able to track down where exactly the Python version is storing its data locally yet.  Any help is much appreciated.p

Negative 220 pIn my desktop program, I want to check that to see if the user has set his clock back.p  pTo do so, I compare the timestamp of certain Operating System files to the current computer date. If any are after what the computer thinks is the current date, then he must have set his clock back.p  pFor Windows XP, I have been using such files as p  precodecwin386.swp cwindowsuser.dat and several others. codepre  pTwo questionsp  ol lipIs this a decent way to do this, or is there something betterpli lipAssuming the answer to 1 is decent What would be some good Windows Vista and Windows 7 files to compare withpli ol  phrp  pConclusion  Priyank said something obvious that had eluded me Rather than using any system files, the easiest and simplest way might be to just use the timestamp of your program itself. After all, the date it was installed is exactly the date you want your trial to start from.p  pAs it turns out, your answers and my research of other related StackOverflow questions and mentioned articles has led me to decide on a much simpler scheme.  My trial users already have to get a key to use the trial. Ive got the date registered embedded into the key. I really dont have to check for setting the clock back. Instead I can just seee if the current time is between the date registered and the date registered plus n days.p  pIf they want to go to the trouble of getting around that scheme, then let them. I agree that those people wouldnt pay anyway. Make your program something worthwhile that people enjoy and want to use and most will pay. p

Negative 220 pNote When I refer to tier, I mean a physical tier. Many of the questions on this site relating to tiers are referring to logical layers, which is not what Im asking about.p  pI am designing an app using a standard 3 layer architecture, with presentation, business logic BLL and data access DAL layers. The technology is WPF, C, LINQ and SQL Server 2008. My question relates to the physical architecture of this app.p  pI can place the BLLDAL in a standard DLL which is loaded and run on the user machine, making a 2 tier architecture  client machine and database server. But it is not too difficult to turn the BLLDAL into a WCF service which sits on an app server and is called from the user machine. This would give me a 3 tier architecture  client machine, app server and database server.p  pMy question is this  what is the advantage of using a 3 tier architecture Ive often been told that 3 tiers add scalability, but its not immediately apparent to me why this would be. And surely you are going to take a performance hit with the same data having to make two hops over the wire  from database server to app server, then from app server to client machine. p  pI would appreciate the advice of experienced architects and developers out there.p

Negative 220 pIve searched around for a solution as best I can, but it seems Im at a loss somewhere.

Negative 220 pI have a distributed JBossbased application that shows a buggy behavior when compiled and run with Java 1.6. It shows an another bug when compiled with Java 1.5 and run with Java 1.6. But it works fine when compiled and run with Java 1.5. What is the best approach to debug this application Is there a lint for Java 1.5 to 1.6 conversion p  pOf course the behavior also depends on the thirdparty libraries I am using. I am using JBoss 4.0.3 and several other libraries too, which I understand is a quite old version. Before I move on to upgrade the JBoss version, I want to make sure that the issue is not related to my code.    p

Negative 220 pI learned that a class can be either public or packageprivate the last value is the default one. A field of a class also can be either public or packageprivate. These statuses have the same meaning. If something is packageprivate it is visible only within the same package. It is public it is visible from everywhere from any package.p  pWhat is not clear to me is how these statuses interplay. In particular I have interest in the following two casesp  ol lipThe class is public but its field is package private. Will be this field visible only from within the packagepli lipThe class is packageprivate and it has a public field. Where will be sing this fieldpli ol  pIn general I do not understand why we bother if a class is public or packageprivate if, in any case, for any individual component of a class field and methods we indicate if it is public or packageprivate.p

I need to detect a scenario whenever a particular perspective is closed or if the application is closed and based on the outcome, I may need to cancel the closing of the app or perspective.  If I had access to the applications WorkbenchAdvisor class, this would be trivial.  As a plugin to this app, how can I detect the event and how can I tell the main applicationadvisor that I need to have the close canceledp

Then I loop through that sub array and call addModule on that column and the name of that module which works correctly. Something buggy happens in my addModule method that it only adds the first and last modules, or sometimes a middle one, or sometimes none at all... im so confusedp

Negative 220 pBefore the beating a dead horse comments begin, let me clarify what I am trying to do to see if someone can help me.p  pI have a parent window with an iFrame in it. The content in the iFrame is loaded from a separate domain which is where I think my problems begin, although it needs to be this way. When the page originally loads I have the following runningp  precode    ltscript languagejavascript typetextjavascriptgt     var reportFrame  document.getElementByIdreport      function resizeIframe          var height  document.documentElement.clientHeight          height  reportFrame.offsetTop           not sure how to get this dynamically         height  20  whatever you set your body bottom marginpadding to be           reportFrame.style.height  height  px            reportFrame.onload  resizeIframe     window.onresize  resizeIframe  ltscriptgt codepre  pThis works great. The iFrame doesnt have any scrollbars and looks perfect to how I want. The problem I run into is the iFrame has a button that causes a postback on the frame. I need to have this script run when the iFrame reloads itself to prevent any scrollbars from showing. Due to the child page being on a separate domain Im not able to call a function from it to the parent pretty sure this is where XSS comes into play so I need to come up with another way for the parent to know it needs to run this script because the iFrame is reloading itself.p  pAny suggestionsp

My proxygenerating code needs a catalog of all of the Python classes that I want to include in my API.  To create this catalog, I am using the codemetaclasscode special attribute to put a hook into the classcreation process.  Specifically, all of the classes in the published API will subclass a particular base class, codePythonDirectPubliccode, which itself has a codemetaclasscode that has been set up to record information about the class creation.p  pSo far so good.  Where it gets complicated is that I want my codePythonDirectPubliccode itself to inherit from a thirdparty class codeenthought.traits.api.HasTraitscode.  This thirdparty class emalsoem uses a codemetaclasscode.p  pSo whats the right way of managing two metaclasses  Should my metaclass be a subclass of Enthoughts metaclass  Or should I just invoke Enthoughts metaclass inside my metaclasss codenewcode method to get the type object that I will return  Or is there some other mystical incantation to use in this particular circumstance p

Negative 220 pIm very new to Maven, and have a question about building multiple Maven projects.p  pWe have two Maven projects, Project A and Project B.p  pProject A depends on an artefact generated by Project B.p  pWhen changes to project A or B are checked into SVN, our local Hudson server builds the modified project and any dependent projects and uploads the artefacts into our local Nexus repository.p  pNow, consider two developers.p  pDeveloper 1 hacks away at project A only, and when Developer 1 builds project A locally, Maven goes and gets the latest project B snapshot artefact from our Nexus server.p  pDeveloper 2 hacks on both project A and project B simultaneously. When Developer 2 builds project A locally, we want maven to build project B with any local changes and use the resulting artefact to build project A. How do we set up Maven to build using the local version of project B instead of getting the artefact from Nexus Is this a standard usage pattern for Mavenp

Negative 220 pIm in a need for doing some sort of processing on the objects that get pickled just before it happens. More precisely for instances of subclasses of a certain base class I would like something totally different to be pickled instead and then recreated on loading.p  pIm aware of codegetstatecode amp codesetstatecode however this is a very invasive approach. My understanding is that these are private methods begin with double underscore codecode, and as such are subject to name mangling. Therefore this effectively would force me to redefine those two methods for every single class that I want to be subject to this non standard behavior. In addition I dont really have a full control over the hierarchy of all classes.p  pI was wondering if there is some sort of brief way of hooking into pickling process and applying this sort of control that codegetstatecode and codesetstatecode give but without having to modify the pickled classes as such.p  pA side note for the curious ones. This is a use case taken from a project using Django and Celery. Django models are either unpickable or very unpractical and cumbersome to pickle. Therefore its much more advisable to pickle pairs of values ID  model class instead. However sometimes its not the model directly that is pickled but rather a dictionary of models, a list of models, a list of lists of models, you name it. This forces me to write a lot of copypaste code that I really dislike. A need for pickling models comes itself from Djangocelery setup, where functions along with their call arguments are scheduled for later execution. Unfortunately among those arguments there are usually a lot of models mixed up in some nontrivial hierarchy.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI do have a possibility of specifying a custom serializer to be used by Celery, so its really a question of being able to build a slightly modified serializer on top of pickle without much effort.p

Negative 220 pIm using the qTip plugin for tooltips. In IE9, the qTip slides in when it appears. Sometimes it slides in from the top of the screen, sometimes from the left, seemingly randomly. Everything else works fine, just like it does in other browsers  the qTip displays with the correct styles, and disappears normally when I leave the element.p  pIm stripped it down to all defaults, so my code is now p  precode    .myclass.qtip codepre  pWhat is causing IE9 to make the tool tips slide in like that Is there a way to stop it In every other browser Ive tried, the tool tip just appears. The IE9 animation is not terrible, but kind of distracting.p  pIs anyone else using qTip in IE9 Are you seeing this behaviorp  pEdit the sliding behavior is predictable not random, as stated above. The first time you trigger a qTip, it will slide in from the upper lefthand corner. The second and subsequent times you trigger that particular qTip, it will slide in horizontally from the lefthand side.p
Negative 220 pIm developing an installer, and I would like to write to a folder accessible only to administrators. So, I need to display the UAC dialog and authenticate as an administrator.

Negative 220 pCan someone please tell me how to save the byte order marker BOM with a file For example, I save a text file now likep  precodeNSString currentFileContent  This is a string of text to represent file content. NSString currentFileName  MyFileName NSString filePath  [NSString stringWithFormat., [self documentsDirectory], currentFileName, rtf] [currentFileContent writeToFilefilePath atomicallyYES encodingNSUTF16StringEncoding erroramperror] codepre  pMy understanding of BOM isp  blockquote   pThe BOM character is the ZERO WIDTH   NOBREAK SPACE character, UFEFF, in   the Unicode character set.p blockquote  pI have an iPhone application that allows users to save text to an RTF file. All works fine if I use NSUTF8StringEncoding, unless the user has doublebyte characters such as Japanese, or Chinese. The simple answer would seem to be saving the file with NSUTF16StringEncoding which is allowed in more recent RTF specs, except that Microsoft Word can only automatically open UTF16 files if a BOM is defined.p  pMy hope is that If I can set a generic BOM, I wont need to identify the users character set as I have no way to know what that is in advance. But they will still be able to open RTF Files with doublebyte characters.p  pThanks for suggestions or insight.p
Negative 220 pIm having a problem finding out which codeNSTextfieldcode is focused.p  pI am building a multilanguage form and have several codeNSTextfieldcodes for data entry. I have to change the text input source for some of the codeNSTextfieldscode during data entry, and I need it to happen automatically.p  pFor now, I can change the text input source as I mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6074757changeinputsourcelanguageprogrammaticallyosxherea without problem.p  pThe problem that I have is to change the input source right when the codeNSTextfieldcode becomes focused. If I use the codecontrolTextDidBeginEditingcode delegate method it changes the source input after typing the first letter. This means that I lose the first word I typed in proper language.p  pIs there any delegate to find it p

Negative 220 pIm trying to use Xcode with an existing project that has a custom build system. It has several different platform targets, and Id like to be able to specify any one of these and build it easily. All Xcode has to do is run codemake buildplatform DEBUG1code or something similar.p  pIve created an External Build System project under the Mac OS X category, since that was the only option. My only foreseeable problem is the Destination list. All I see here now isp  ul liMy Mac 64bitli liMy Mac 32bitli ul  pIve looked everywhere I can think of to change these, but to no avail. I need a list of different platforms here. How can I do this, and what would be the correct way to customize the build settings based on the destinationp  pNote I could probably also make this work with schemes for each platform, but Id rather do it with destinations. Either way I still need to know how to get the make target to change based on the active setting.p

Negative 220 pIm trying to add values to the yArray. However in the NSLog, it always shows up null. I am synthesizing the NSMutableArray yArray and get no errors or warnings on compiling. I believe one reason might be that i am not initializing the array. I read somewhere that synthesize does not initialize. However, im a beginner and im not sure how to properly initialize the array. Ive researched it on google but couldnt figure it out. Can someone tell me how or at least point me in the right direction. I posted a part of my code below.

Negative 220 pI am developing a simple webserver which handles the communication with the browser via XML. p  pIn order to ensure that the type of the variables is correct, I wrap most of the attributes in my classes via getterssetters. Something likep  precodeclass Animalobject     def initself         superAnimal, self.init         self.age  None      def setAgeself, age         try             self.age  intage         except TypeError             self.age  None      def getAgeself         return self.age      age  propertygetAge, setAge codepre  pThe server also has an authentication and permissioning system the typical loginpassword thingy....p  pLets say the logged user doesnt have permission to set the Animals age in the server, but hes trying to a bit of a huacker, weve got here, because the javascript should have disabled the age input text but thats a different issue... Back to the pointp  pRight now, when I receive a POST, I open the XML contained in it, and check if someone is trying to set something he doesnt have permission to. Something likep  precodedef receivePOSTrequest     xmlTree  Utilities.getXMLTreerequest.body     loggedUser  Utilities.getLoggedUser      if xmlTree.findtextage and not loggedUser.hasPermissionsetAge         raise ExceptionUser s was trying to change the age  loggedUser.userName codepre  pof course, in the real server there are way more if...elif... because there are way more permissions to checkp  pI was wondering if its a good idea to put do that permission checking in the getterssetters well... in the setter, mainly. It would have to be something like thisp  precodeclass Animalobject     def initself         superAnimal, self.init         self.age  None      def setAgeself, age         if age is not None             loggedUser  Utilities.getLoggedUser             if loggedUser.hasPermissionsetAge                 try                     self.age  intage                 except TypeError                     self.age  None             else                 raise ExceptionUser s was trying to change the age  loggedUser.userName         else             self.age  None codepre  pOn one hand, it seems a pretty natural place to check the permission when youre actually going to do something. That would also shield all the classes in my server in a much more effective way what if somehow the age is being set without going through the receivePOST method... There wouldnt be a permission check in that case. On the other hand, that means that I can only use my Animal class in the server enviroment where I have a loggedUser.p  pAlso, Ive read that properties should ideally be kept simple, and that is not a great practice start loading the getterssetters with code that can cause a lot of side effects some people say that is difficult to track errors when the code just reads myDuck.age  512p  pI dont know...

Negative 220 pmy questions is little similar to some of the questions asked previously about overlapped spritesmovieclips like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2408486actionscriptreceivingmouseeventsforlowerindexedandpartiallycovereddisplthisa. But my requirement is slightly different than them.p  pI want to handle the mouseevents for all the sprites on the stage including the one those are hidden behind or overlapped or occluded and the main condition is that I want to handle the occluded sprite that hidden behind other sprite. example, say I have sprite1 and sprite2 on stage and I want to start drag whenever i click on the sprite and stop drag after another click.p  pThis can be done easily, but the problem and my main requirement is that if I drag the sprite1 and drop it exactly on top of the sprite2 then sprite2 will be hidden behind the sprite1 I wont be able to drag the sprite2 without moving the sprite1 first. if you have played zyngas empires and allais game on facebook, it is handled seperatly, it is how it works in that game, the mouse event is triggered on the sprite behind the overlapping sprite, if you have two sprites overlapping one sprite than the mouse event is triggered on the sprite which is last and not the one in front irrespective of whether there is only one sprite overlapping or two or three and this happens to irregular shaped sprites not just rectanglesp  pif any one can give me hit on how zynga might have implemented this or help me find out how to achive it it will be great helpp  pthanksp

Posts, Pages, and Media do not show up.p  pMaybe this has to do with the postauthor index they WordPress added I verified the user existed with matching ID.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuvaFY.png altExample Screenshot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.como4JaA.png altExample Screenshot 2 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXmoY4.png altExample Screenshot 3p

So I do codeImports ltxmlnsMYNAMESPACEgtcode. Now I need to 1 find the codeltReportItemsgtcode node at first, and 2 add my new node. In order to do the first step, I triedp  precodeDim xmldoc  XDocument.LoadMYXMLFILEPATH Dim target  xmldoc.Root.ElementsMYNAMESPACE amp ReportItems.FirstOrDefault codepre  pAnd to do step 2, I didp  precodeDim newNode As XElement       ltReportItemgt target.AddnewNode codepre  pNow there is the problem if I dont specify the codeMYNAMESPACEcode when I query the Root element, I cant find codeReportItemscode at all. It is because the string is actually used to implicitly construct a XName object god knows why I cant assign the NS to XName object explicitly, and this object is used to search. If I dont give the curly brackets part, it will search within empty namespace, so it cant find the codeltReportItemsgtcodenode which is in MYNAMESPACE. But if I give this curly brackets namespace, the final xml file will look like thisp  precodeltReport xmlnsMYNAMESPACE   ltWidthgt100ltWidthgt   ltHeightgt100ltHeightgt   ltReportItemsgt     ltReportItemgt     ltReportItem xmlnsMYNAMESPACEgt     ... ltReportgt codepre  pThe second codeltReportItemgtcode is the newlyadded one, but sadly this is not a valid file my parser is complaining in the further processing of xml file. So how can I make this new item look exactly like the existing one, without any namespace This has been driving me crazy. I spent a whole day to figure out that I need to add the curly brackets so that it will find the target node it doesnt work like what the link above says that it adds and searches the default NS automatically, but now it adds something unnecessary Its gotta be kidding mep

Negative 220 pI wrote a method for searching an object in my arralist, however I need this search to take two parameters and compare them to the description of the object. What it is confusing me is that I do not know how to make my method take two parameter and those two parameters compare to one single description.  e.g  Description of object Blue Mustangp  pNow the search method has to take two parameters in this case one String Blue and one String Mustang and I do not have a clue how to do it. I found a way to just write the complete description as one parameter and works perfectly. I am leaving the method that I tried to change to look for two parameters and as well the method that takes one parameter and works fine.

Negative 220 pIve got a fairly important conceptual issue that many people have asked about, but there isnt a readily available clear answer to be found by searching.p  pMy application is simple Several rows of TableViewCells populated with data from a parsed JSON feed. When a cell is clicked on, that cells info is passed to a SecondViewController and displayed. The JSON feed is also stored to a .plist and in the case that the internet is not available, the TableViewCells are populated from the .plist.p  pThis is all working great.p  pHowever, the last thing I need is a refresh button at the top of my FirstViewController to refresh the JSON feed, and all of the cells in the table with the new data from the new variables. However, Ive encountered an issue with implementing thisp  pMy original JSON call, and variables to populate the cells are located in the ViewDidLoad method. When the view loads, these variables are set and dont refresh. Further, I can move the JSON call and variables into viewWillLoad  which will refresh the table each time after clicking on a cell, and then clicking back to the firstViewController  this will update the JSON and cells successfully, however it does impact the speed and makes the view controller pause when going back to the MainViewController, which makes calling my original JSON and setting my variables in viewWillLoad an unviable option.p  pI have created a reload button in ViewDidLoad, which is linked to an IBAction method refreshp  pstrongCreate Button Programitically in ViewDidLoadstrongp  precode Reload issues button UIBarButtonItem button  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]                            initWithBarButtonSystemItemUIBarButtonSystemItemRefresh                            targetself                            actionselectorrefresh] self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem  button [button release] codepre  pstrongAction Method its linked tostrongp  precode IBActionrefreshidsender       myRawJson  [[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfURL[NSURL                                     URLWithStringhttpwww.yoursite.comjson.JSON]                                     encodingNSUTF8StringEncoding                                    errornil]      SBJsonParser parser  [[SBJsonParser alloc] init]     NSDictionary  myParsedJson  [parser objectWithStringmyRawJson errorNULL]   New updated dictionary built from refreshed JSON     allLetterContents  [myParsedJson objectForKeynodes]   Log the new refreshed JSON     NSLogYou clicked refresh.

Negative 220 pI have a problem changing my axis labels in Matplotlib. I want to change the radial axis options in my Polar Plot.p  pBasically, Im computing the distortion of a cylinder, which is nothing but how much the radius deviates from the original perfectly circular cylinder. Some of the distortion values are negative, while some are positive due to tensile and compressive forces.

Negative 220 pI am very confused about when and when not to use native queries in JPA 2.0.  I was under the impression that using native queries could cause me to get out of sync with the JPA cache.  If I can accomplish the same thing with a JPQL or CriteriaBuilder query, is there any good reason to use a native query  Similarly, is there any danger in using a native query if I can accomplish the same thing with JPQL or CriteriaBuilder  And finally, if there is a danger in using a native query as far as getting out of sync with the JPA cache, would the same danger exist in executing an equivalent query with JPQL or CriteriaBuilderp  pMy philosophy has been do avoid native queries, but surely there are times where they are necessary.  It seems to me that if I can do it with JPQL or CriteriaBuilder, then I should.p  pThanks.p

The constructor strongINITstrong takes 2 functions as paramater a function to be called each time  x is changed, and a function to be called each time x is readp  pThe following statementp  precodex1 codepre  pwould save 1 and trigger a call to codechangecallback1code which could do anything.p  pThe following statementp  precodeax codepre  pwould retrieve the stored value and call codereadcallbackcode which would possibly change  the stored value and do other things.p  pI would like this to work with any type, e.g. to be able to write things likep  pcodex[1 2 3]code which would trigger codechangecallback[1 2 3]codep  pcodex.append4code would trigger codechangecallback[1 2 3 4]code and possibly a call to codereadcallbackcode beforep  pcodexa1code would trigger codechangecallbacka1codep  pcodeprintxcode would trigger a call to readcallback...and return the last stored value for printing, of course.p  pThe idea is that any access to the variable could be logged, or generate other calculation... seemlessly.p  pI get the feeling this should be possible, but I dont really see what my object should inherit from... If I have to restrict me to one type,e.g. a list, is there any way to redefine all assignment operators including methods like append... in one go, keeping the original behaviour the base class method and adding the callback...p  pOr are there more appropriate ways modules... to achieve the same goals...p  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 220 pIm writing an in house intranet application which needs to update our Facebook status. Im new to FB development so please go easy I dont want this application to be visible to anyone  the updates will occur via a call to the API using the FB C sdk  Im currently running in devsandbox mode and its all working but is there a simpler way i can update FB status without having to create an app in FB and authenticate etc. with OAuth This has to be done via a web application as we have an internal review process that needs to take place on the status content then posted via an app when someone who knows the Facebook access details logs in via the app itself.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 220 pIm developing a Google App Engineapp where one can fill out an onlineform and based on how you fill it out a calendar post in a specific Google Calendar is created. What Im wondering about is authorization in this type of situation where I want this form to be 100 publicly available and require no login whatsover to create the calendar post.p  pUsing OAuth2 I have gotten the actual form and postcreation to work as I want but only when Im signed in.p  pThis is what Im doing now, I havep  ul liOne registered app, lets call it formapp.appspot.comli liOne Google account, lets call it formappadmingmail.com This account owns the Google Calendar that the posts are going in.li liOne API Project owned by formappadminli ul  pI have used these and the googleapipythonclient library with its oauth2decorator as in the Google App Engineexample so when Im logged in as formappadmin and surf onto formapp.appspot.com everything works exactly as I want it to but if I am not logged in as formappadmin, naturally, it doesnt. p  pSo what I would like to do is to kind of grant this permission to write to formappadmins primary calendar to the actual app rather than the user currently using the app. Or is there a better way The only premises is that anyone logged into gmail or not should be able to fill out the form and thus creating a post in some google calendar.p  pNaturally I would be very thankful if anyone happened to have the appropriate python code to achieve this but primarily I want help figuring out how to go about this since I have very little experience with authrelated stuff.p  pThank you for your time Tottishp

Negative 220 pI am trying to find the USRP2 blocks in order to utilize my USRP2. In alot of examples their exists a USRP2 Source that they use and maybe thats the reason why Im not able to actually send and receive a signal using two USRP2s. We turn on the receiver at exactly the same freq as the transmitter and we are never capable of seeing a signal. The root of this question lies in that if we do the same thing but with 2 URSP1s we can see something in the receiver side.p

Negative 220 pI am trying to create a jqGrid using the result of a jQuery selection from an XML string. p  pI have a page that loads a large XML response SOAP.

The codeloatTabTripcode function below works fine with a raw string of XML given as the codetravelXmlcode argument, but it does not work with the jQuery result.

Negative 220 pI am coming to you with a problem that drives me crazy. I am writing this packet bouncer in C. It works perfectly fine under Ubuntu but a very weird thing happens with openSuse. In a part of the code that is NOT executed for the current test, I declare a variable codechar commandcode. When I initialize this variable with something like codechar command  malloc10code, something happens and it changes some other variables here, some info in the header of the packet that I send. Nothing changes if I later free the variable codefreecommandcode. I am not very good in everything that touches memory management and I cant figure this one out... You may lack some info to answer my question, do not hesitate to ask.

The packet bouncer acts like a proxyp  precode        ping            ping client gt bouncer gt server codepre  pIf every thing works fine, the bouncers replaces the destination IP by the servers IP and the sender IP by its own. The bouncer is given a new IP that is not one of its interfaces. When I do the allocation of this variable, the bouncer uses not its IP as sender IP, but one of the interface of the machine. It also mess up the protocol and the flags of the packet.p  pEDIT2 valgrind gives those two errorsp  precode Creating socket  Setting socket options 4449 Syscall param socketcall.setsockoptoptval points to uninitialised bytes 4449    at 0x513C7CA setsockopt in lib64libc2.11.3.so 4449    by 0x40226F processpkt processpkt.c296 4449    by 0x4E382ED  in usrlib64libpcap.so.1.1.1 4449    by 0x4E3B2C0 pcaploop in usrlib64libpcap.so.1.1.1 4449    by 0x40195E main bouncer.c87 4449  Address 0x7ff0002fc is on thread 1s stack 4449   Generating icmp packet  Sending packet 4449 Syscall param socketcall.sendtoto.sinport points to uninitialised bytes 4449    at 0x513C763 sendtonocancel in lib64libc2.11.3.so 4449    by 0x4022BA processpkt processpkt.c314 4449    by 0x4E382ED  in usrlib64libpcap.so.1.1.1 4449    by 0x4E3B2C0 pcaploop in usrlib64libpcap.so.1.1.1 4449    by 0x40195E main bouncer.c87 4449  Address 0x7ff000302 is on thread 1s stack 4449   Packet sent codepre

The function is very expensive to compute and so the number of function evaluations sampling points should be minimal. At the same time, the complexity of the algorithm is not important.p

Negative 220 pI am using primefaces3.3 version. I have a datatable to show the details and the CRUD buttons as part of the footer of the datatable. A Dialog is shown on click of the CRUD buttons after selecting a particular row in the datatable.p  pWhen i click on the Save button in the dialog , the data is saved and the datatable is refreshed. However, sortBy , pagination options are not working after this. Along with this datatables selection mode is changed to multiple. This behavior is reproducable in IE 8 and FF 12. It works perfectly fine in Google Chrome 19.

Negative 220 pI have a standard Table View with the default settings inside my main nib. I use an Array Controller and Bindings for dealing with the data that the table view should show to the users. I already achieved that the add button inserts the new row and sets the first column to editing mode so the users can type their text immediately. My problem is i cant detect when the editing is over and i should save the new values. I couldnt find any delegate method andor any notification for this purpose. I searched the internet and i couldnt find anything useful. Im not even sure that im doing it right, i didnt add any specific thing, i just use the standard double click editing that the table view offers for each cell.p  pAny help is much appreciated. Thanks in advancep

Negative 220 pI am using Raphael to draw some paths.  Each path has an associated rectangle [container] the size and position of the bounding box.  I am using the container for dragging both shapes.p  pIn the move callback, I update the both positions so they both move together.p  pThis all works great until I serialize.  I am only serializing the path, then creating the container on the fly after deserialization.p  pImmediately after converting to json and back, things look fine.  I can print out the current transform of the path and it looks correct.  Doing any transform on the path after this results in the path being reset and moved to 0,0.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netacablernX8BS25 relnofollowHere is a fiddlea that shows the problem.  p  pIf you move the rect, you can see both objects move together.  p  pIf you click SaveLoad, things look fine, and the path prints the same.p  pIf you now drag, the path gets reset to 0,0.

Negative 220 pIve recently started using a hrefhttpsoftware.intel.comenusintelippIntel Performance Primitives IPPa for image processing. For those who havent heard of IPP, think of IPP as the analogue of a hrefhttpsoftware.intel.comenusintelmklMKLa for image processing instead of linear algebra.p  pIve already implemented a somewhat complicated vision system in OpenCV, and Id like to swap out some of the OpenCV routines e.g. convolution and FFT for faster IPP routines. My OpenCV code always uses the codecvMatcode image data structure. However, based on the IPP code samples, it seems that IPP prefers the a hrefhttpwww.codeforge.comread116995ippiImage.hhtmlcodeCIppiImagecodea data structure. p  pMy system does several image transformations in OpenCV, then I want to do a couple of things in IPP, then do more work in OpenCV. Heres a naive way to make OpenCV and IPP play nicely togetherp  precode cvMat  load original image  use OpenCV to do some work on cvMat  write cvMat to file   CIppiImage  read cvMat from file for IPP  use IPP to do some work on CIppiImage  write CIppiImage to file   cvMat  read CIppiImage from file  use OpenCV to do more work on cvMat  write final image to file codepre  pHowever, this is kind of tedious, and readingwriting files probably adds to the overall execution time.p  hr  pIm trying to make it more seamless to alternate between OpenCV and IPP in an image processing program. Here are a couple of things that could solve the problemp  ol liIs there a oneliner that would convert a codecvMatcode to codeCIppiImagecode and vice versali liI am pretty familiar with the codecvMatcode implementation details, but I dont know much about codeCIppiImagecode.

Negative 220 pThat question is wordy, but let me explainp  pI have a column in my DataTable table that I can edit using jEditable. p  pI give that column the class codejeditablecode through the DataTables option which picks up some CSS formatting blue background.p  pThen I make the column editable with the jEditable function.p  pAt a specific point, Id like to make that column uneditable, and remove the blue background.p  pI call code.jeditable.editabledisablecode which perfectly disables the editing on all columns of my table.p  pI also call code.jeditable.removeClassjeditablecode to remove the blue background CSS formatting. This removes the blue background from that column, as expected.p  pHowever, when I go to any of the paginated pages, while they are not editable, theyre still blue, because they still have the codejeditablecode class.p  pIs there any method to remove a class from ALL elements in HTML, regardless of if theyre visiblep

Negative 220 pWe use Apache solr as an embeded search engine in IBM Websphere Commerce v7, and facing the below issue when configuring solr unstructured content search for our ecommerce based application.Recently we configured solr content search unstructured search in our application. p  pWhenever we search for any stopwords mentioned in the stopwords.txt such as  about, among, an, a, the etc., it brings all results from the solr. I checked the solr Analyzer in the admin console, the search field is configured with StopFilterFactory, hence Solr ignores the stopword and passes a blank string as a solr query, which brings all results. p  pHowever, as per our requirement, we want to configure solr to prevent fetching any results incase there is an empty query, or the input word is a stopword.p  pIt seems like, the default behavior of solr is, bring all results in case of empty query.p  pAny help in this topic will be appreciated.p  pThanking you in advance.p  pRegards,p  pJitendriya Dashp

Can PHP do the samep  pstrongALSO,strong I dont plan on autoplaying the music, but rather just have it available for the user to play whenever theyd like.p  pAn example of how my player would look and function can be found at a hrefhttpwww.reverbnation.com relnofollowwww.reverbnation.coma.p

Negative 220 pI reviewed a lot of literature, but I dont found any information about deleting or insertion substrings into suffix tree. There are only Ukkonens or McCreights algorithms for building tree.br  The poorest way is to rebuild tree after deleting or inserting a substring. But I think that exists a best way to do it.br  For example positions are counted from 0 br     I have suffix tree with abcdef and I need to delete symbols from 1 to 3. And then I will have suffix tree with aef. And then I need to add from position 1 string as. And after this I will have suffix tree with aasef. Can you help mep
Negative 220 pSuppose I want to ask a user what format they want a certain output to be in and the output will include fillin fields.

Negative 220 pIve been trying to learn the basics of loops and Im getting there but Im struggling to get my brain around the following requirement where, for example, Ive got data from a database table via tinytds, such that keyvalues are hashed into an array it seems  beginner here, so hope my terminology is correctp  pThe data is such that the values from one column of the db table is repeated many times, whilst the values of the 2nd column are unique.p  pTherefore, rather than simply creating a table in HTML for output that simply has 2 columns with column1 showing the same line of text over and over before the next unique string lists over and over, Id like to present the information so that unique string values from column1 are headings and the values of column2 are then listed beneath.p  pIn my mind, I think what Im trying to achieve is to loop through column1 for each unique string, output that value, whilst running an inner loop to list all values for column2 where column1 is string, moving on to the next unique value of column1,output that value, then loop through column2 again to list all values where column1 is string2 etc.p  pHope that makes sense as Im struggling to know how to explain in the correct terminology.p  pThanks.p  pFor example, if my 2 columns from my database table were as follows.p  pColumn1br Q1br Q1br Q1br Q2br Q2br Q3br Q3br Q3  p  pColumn2br A1br A2br A3br A4br A5br A6br A7br A8  p  pHow could I loop or whatever is best through to be able to present the output such asp  pQ1br  A1br  A2br  A3  p  pQ2br  A4br  A5p  pQ3br  A6br  A7br  A8p  pI can write the HTML side to format the output, I just cant figure out the ruby side.p  pFor a single loop Ive picked up from tinytds examples the following ruby the html here is just to test placement for nowp  precodelt narrative.each do question gt ltspangtltquestion.values[1] gtltspangt ltbrgt    lt end gt codepre  pThat allows me to list all the values for slot 2 is that correct terminology and I could do something likep  precodelt narrative.each do question gt ltspangtltquestion.values[0] gtltspangtltspangtltquestion.values[1] gtltspangt ltbrgt    lt end gt codepre  pTo show both side by side, but what Im wanting to do is be more likep  precodelth1gtQuestion1 goes herelth1gt ltulgt ltligtAnswer 1ltligt ltligtAnswer 2ltligt ltligtAnswer 3ltligt ltulgt lth1gtQuestion2 goes herelth1gt ltulgt ltligtAnswer 4ltligt ltligtAnswer 5ltligt ltulgt codepre  petc.p

Here is my codep  precode    if  Color.redpixel amp Color.bluepixel amp Color.greenpixelgt 220          ifTTSInitialized             mTts.speakColor is White, TextToSpeech.QUEUEFLUSH, null                  textViewCol.setTextColor is White.         return true      if  Color.redpixel amp Color.bluepixel amp Color.greenpixel lt 10          ifTTSInitialized             mTts.speakColor is Black, TextToSpeech.QUEUEFLUSH, null                  textViewCol.setTextColor is Black.         return true      if  Color.redpixel amp Color.bluepixel gt 120          ifTTSInitialized             mTts.speakColor is Purple, TextToSpeech.QUEUEFLUSH, null                   textViewCol.setTextColor is Purple.     return true      if  Color.redpixel gt Color.bluepixel amp Color.greenpixel          ifTTSInitialized             mTts.speakColor is  RED, TextToSpeech.QUEUEFLUSH, null                  textViewCol.setTextColor is  Red.         return true codepre  pMy application has Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Cyan, Black and White.

Negative 220 pIve got a table that can be filtered by multiple checkboxes, as well as by a select dropdown.  Essentially, what I want to be able to do is click on multiple checkboxes in order to find each row containing that class, so class 1 and 3, or example, and then filter it by the location.p  pIve gotten really close at this point, where I can select both the location which is also a class, two letters for state abbreviations, and a single class from the checkboxes, but I want people to be able to compare multiple classes from the checkboxes.p  pThe problem is something I understand, but cant seem to figure out how to fix. The code adds each class to the end of the tr. This means if you apply 2 filters from the checkboxes, it finds nothing, instead of finding everything from each filter.  While this behavior is perfectly functional for 1 checkbox and the Dropdown, meaning it will only give me Filter 1 values from Tennessee, I want it to be able to give me Filter 2, Filter 3, and Filter 4 at the same time, if I so choose.p  pAny ideas on how to alter this to make it allow multiple checkbox selections  Thanks By the way, Im very limited in what JavaScriptjQuery plugins I can use, which is why Im fighting so hard to use tableSorter with this solution.p  pMy HTMLp  precode ltform nameFilterForm idFilterForm action methodgt     ltinput typecheckbox namefilterStatus value1 gtltlabel forfilter1gtFilter 1ltlabelgt     ltinput typecheckbox namefilterStatus value2 gtltlabel forfilter2gtFilter 2ltlabelgt     ltinput typecheckbox namefilterStatus value3 gtltlabel forfilter3gtFilter 3ltlabelgt     ltinput typecheckbox namefilterStatus value4 gtltlabel forfilter4gtFilter 4ltlabelgt     ltselect typedropdown namefilterStatus idchooseState classfiltergt       ltoption valueZZgtChoose Stateltoptiongt       ltoption valueTNgtTennesseeltoptiongt       ltoption valueMOgtMissouriltoptiongt       ltoption valueNVgtNevadaltoptiongt       ltoption valueIAgtIowaltoptiongt     ltselectgtltlabelgtStateltlabelgt        ltformgt  lttable idStatusTablegt      lttbodygt                                lttr class1 TNgt        lttd classNamegtlttdgt        lttd classIDgtlttdgt        lttd classTypegtlttdgt        lttd classLocationgtCity, Tennesseelttdgt        lttd classClassgtlttdgt        lttd classReceivedgtlttdgt        lttd classActiongtlttdgt        lttd classStatusgtActivelttdgt      lttrgt lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pJavaScriptp  precode    input[namefilterStatus], select.filter.changefunction   var classes   var stateClass        input[namefilterStatus].eachfunction      if this.ischecked      classes  .  this.val        select.filter.eachfunction  if this.val  ZZ  stateClass  .  this.val    if classes   ampamp stateClass     if no filters selected, show all items StatusTable tbody tr.show  else   otherwise, hide everything...

Negative 220 pI have a loop in my application that loops through a set of entities in the following fashionp  precodeforeachvar entity in mEntities      entity.Update  codepre  pSome of these entities maintain a networking component that will call a Azure Mobile Service in order to update their state to the server. An example is belowp  precodepublic class TestEntity      public int Index     public int PropertyValue      public async void Update              Task.Run gt              MyAzureMobileServiceClient.UpdateIndex, PropertyValue                codepre  pThe UI rendering is done by Monogame in a more traditional game loop fashion.

Granted it wasnt to the backend yet, but at least I have a work around by doing the whole thing manually. Would prefer to not do that, however.p  p[update 3] This is getting peculiar. I realize I simplified the code in this question in order to get it coherent in the context. However, this appears to have removed the true source of the problem. I tried the following thingsp  ol liI created a HTTP request and created the request manually, called it inside the Task.Run and it worked splendidly with no latency.li liI called the Azure Mobile Service client Update DIRECTLY and there was no latency.li ol  pSo this brings me to where the problem lies. I basically have a wrapper class for the Azure Mobile Service. The real path that goes looks roughly like thisp  precodeCommunicationClient.UpdateAsyncmyObject  public Task UpdateAsyncMyObjectType obj      var table  mMobileServiceClient.GetTableltMyObjectTypegt     return table.UpdateAsyncobj  codepre  pThis causes the lag, but if I do this instead of it, it works with no latency whatsoeverp  precodevar client  CommunicationClient.MobileServiceClient var table  client.GetTableltMyObjectTypegt table.UpdateAsyncobj codepre  pSoooooo... I should probably refactor the whole question. Its getting tldry.p

Is there a javascript equivalent to this functionp  pI am just learning Python now, and although I have been told javascript is functional language, I can see that I have been programming in a nonfunctional javascript style.

Negative 220 pWhat happens internally between loading XAML or BAML and receiving the root object Window, for examplep  pWhat first pops up in my mind is that Reflecton is used to create objects, set their properties and so on. But maybe I am wrong p  pMaybe someone can explain how XAMLBAML is parsed and executed at runtime or give a link to a good article with the explanationp  pTo make my question a little bit more clear, lets discuss the short examplep  precodeltButton Margin10gtOKltButtongt codepre  pSo, the parser sees that a Button object needs to be created, that its Margin property has to be set to 10 and its content has to be set to OK. How is that done By using Reflection plus TypeConverters, etcp

Negative 220 pI have a site that uses codeajaxcode to store data so that the page does not need to be refreshed. I leave the page open all the time. When the session expires, I can manually refresh the page and the session will be restored. However, if the session expires and I try to send an codeajaxcode request to the server, the response will be a code403 forbiddencode error.p  pWhy can I manually refresh the page and have the session restored, but if I do an codeajaxcode request the session is not restoredp  pI have tried having an codeajaxcode request call the very same page that I am on to see if that would cause the session to refresh, to no avail.p  pFrom what I have read, an codeajaxcode request is the same as a manual request. So doing codeajaxcode calls should be refreshing the session just the same as reloading the page. But apparently this is not the case.p  pIt is interesting to note that if I let my session expire or delete the cookie, or remove the session file from the server and then try an codeajaxcode call in a for loop it will continually return a code403code. Then if I open another window and load the same page, the session will refresh and the codeajaxcode responses in the original window will immediately change from code403code to code200code.p  pWhat am I missingp  pFor reference, I am using CakePHP framework, Nginx web server, on Ubuntu linux.p

Negative 220 pAfter we recently added and replaced a few icons, we started getting a nastylooking dialog box in IE8 on Windows XP p  blockquote   pThis page uses fonts that need to be temporarily installed.  This is   usually safe.  Do you want to allow these fonts to be downloaded p      p[Yes] [No]p blockquote  pIt can be avoided by changing some settings in IE8, but this is terrible user experience, and doesnt appear to happen in other sites with web fonts.p  pThe font in question is a custom collection of free web icons, collected and configured using the a hrefhttpfontastic.mefontastic.mea web app, and using their output for the fontface declarations, character codes and css classnames.  p  pThe font has been in production for 4 months or so and was loading fine on IE8XP without any dialog.  After the latest update to the font addreplace a few icons, this dialog began popping up.  Its only in IE8 and only on XP Windows 7 is fine.  p  pAnother interesting data point is that on IE9 not IE8, theres an error in the console, for both before and after the font file change p  blockquote   pCSS3111 fontface encountered unknown error.    zLhfkPOm5ykmdmwXaiuw.eotp blockquote  pThis looks like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14092444this problema, but in our case the font loads fine.p  pAlso, previously, we had trouble installing the font file on our local operating systems to allow Photoshop comping and had to run it through font squirrels processor to get it working.  Now, it installs in the OS fine.p  pSo my theory is that perhaps before, the .EOT file IE8 was using had some problems with it that prevented IE from trying to download it, and recently fontastic fixed these issues, paving the way for IE8 to attempt to download it.  The fact that there are known issues with a a hrefhttpwww.kirsle.netwizardsttf2eot.cgicommon .EOT file generatora may be relevant, though I dont know what tools fontastic uses.   p  pWhat could cause the dialog to appear all of a sudden  p

Ive got this problem today lets assume that I have hundreds of pages, with almost the same structure but it is not mandatory. this pages are already done, and I can only view them cannot edit html them in any way. Also, in all well, most of them, jquery is included, but is included the 1.5 at this moment.p  pwhat I would like to do, is to track via an ajax call all the clicks on the page, before they actually do something.p  pI have an injection point, at the begginning of the page, right after the inclusion of jquery just to know itp  pactually, Ive bind a click event to document, right thisp  precodedocument.bindclick, functionevt      evt.preventDefault     alertevt.target.id and evt.target.class and evt.target.name     ajax call will be here     try     evt.triggerclick     catche  codepre  pthe result is pretty forward... any click on the page fires an alert, in some cases i got an ID, some other times i got a class... or undefined end so on. The problem with this solution is that every single click is binded, and this is really a blind way, I would like to get only clicks from those clickable elements such as links, buttons, checkboxes... while ignoring divs, html elements... body, and so on.p  pstrongIs there a trick where I can select only those elements that permit a click on themstrong or it is not possible and the second question is... is that codepreventDefaultcode handled in a good way by adding at the end the codeevt.triggerclickcode I mean, I cant broke all those page, just becouse i put a preventdefault at the beginning, I must preserve the functionality of those elements...p  pIm not searching for a out of the box solution, I just want to understand if its possible... or if there is some hack, cheat, well...something i could use to achieve this.p  pany ideasp  pMy second solution is to write down all classes,ids,names of those clicckable elements of every single page... but they are hundreds... and this is a bit... well... you got it.p  pthanks in advance.p

Negative 220 pI was wanting to know if anyone could help me out with this problem. The purpose of the program is suppose to be that the user enters a year, say 1980 and the program returns the next year that has distinctive digits, distinctive being all the digits are different, for example 20132019, 2012 is not distinctive since the number two occurs twice, 20132019 are all distinct because the numbers only occur once. p  pUser enters year Program calculates next year that has distinctive digitsp  pThis is the code I have right now. The only purpose of it right now is to return true if the number the user enters is distinct, I could only find a way of doing it with String type and charAt method. I dont think you can increment strings but if it is possible for the user to enter an int and the program keeps incrementing until it finds a number that is distinct but all I could come up with is a function that accepts string. Is there a similar method I could make with int as a parameter or is there a way I could possibly make it work with Stringsp  precode public static boolean hasDuplicatesString text         forint i  0 i lt text.length  1 i             forint j  i  1 j lt text.length j                  iftext.charAti  text.charAtj                     return true                                                 return false      codepre  pAny advice is appreciated.

Negative 220 pMore complex questions in this vein have been asked and answered elsewhere this one may be just too trivial to pose. In a cluster, I have a program compiled and linked to shared boost libraries on the head node in usrlocallib, and this boost version is newer than that available with the clusters distribution. The program runs fine on the head node, as I have LDLIBRARYPATH exported. If I try and run it using the torque scheduler, the libraries arent available on the compute nodes, thus producing the error while loading shared libraries .... Aside from rebuilding boost as a static library and linking the program that way, is there an easy way to make these libraries available to all nodes Simply exporting the path in the job script, i.e. p  precodeexport LDLIBRARYPATHusrlocallibLDLIBRARYPATH codepre  pdoes not work, because obviously the path doesnt exist on the compute node.

Negative 220 pI recently had a friend who specializes in ladder logic and not web programming, come to me requesting help with a project from her employer. While I use more traditional coding languages, I am far from an expert in jquery and php myself. The problem that we are having is that a php page with a jquery  html form inserted into a parent page via XMLHttpRequest, is not executing its post action from the parent page. The thing that makes this problem more difficult is that when page is run by itself outside of the parent page loaded directly into the browser, it executes its post action fine. I have done many hours of searching and trial and error at this point but am stumped and now come to you for help. Below are the relevant bits of code.

Negative 220 pI use Google Chrome with Intern to run automated tests and I would like to know if there is a way to launch Chrome in emulation mode from CLI or using a specific flag to test mobile rendering. If not, do you know a good workaround p  pI could directly use the Android Emulator from Android SDK with Selenium Webdriver apk or with mobile Chrome but tests are crashing most of the time, emulators dont respond and I have to restart it. Also, I need to test on the largest possible scope, not limited to Android devices. Chrome on desktop is a lot more stable and even if a test fails, chrome always respond and can be closed automatically by Intern.p  pI tried a workaround with the enabletouchevents flag and with a custom userAgent but its producing weird behaviors. Maybe some other flags would help me p  pThank you in advance for your answer. p

Negative 220 pAs part of a bigger application I am working on a class for reading input from a text file for use in the initialization of the program. Now I am myself fairly new to programming, and I only started to learn C in December, so I would be very grateful for some hints and ideas on how to get started I apologise in advance for a rather long wall of text.p  pThe text file format is keyworddriven in the following wayp  ul liThere are a rather small number of mainsection keywords currently 8 that need to be written in a given order. Some of them are optional, but if they are included they should adhere to the given ordering.li ul  pstrongExamplestrongp  pSuppose there are 3 potential keywords ordered like as followsp  precodeKEY1 required KEY2 optional KEY3 required  codepre  pIf the input file only includes the required ones, the ordering should bep  precodeKEY1 KEY3 codepre  pOtherwise it should bep  precodeKEY1 KEY2 KEY3 codepre  ul lipIf all the required keywords are present, and the total ordering is ok, the program should proceed by reading each section in the sequence given by the ordering.pli lipEach section will include a possibly large amount of subkeywords, some of which are optional and some of which are not, but here the order does NOT matter.pli lipLines starting with characters codecode or codecode signify commented lines, and they should be ignored as well as empty lines.pli lipA line containing a keyword should preferably include nothing else than the keyword. At the very least, the keyword must be the first word appearing there.pli ul  pI have already implemented parts of the framework, but I feel my approach so far has been rather adhoc. Currently I have manually created one method per sectionmain keyword , and the first task of the program is to scan the file for to locate these keywords and pass the necessary information on to the methods. p  pI first scan through the file using an codestdifstreamcode object, removing empty andor commented lines and storing the remaining lines in an object of type codestdvectorltstdstringgtcode. p  pstrongDo you think this is an ok approachstrongp  pMoreover, I store the indices where each of the keywords start and stop in two integer arrays in this vector. This is the input to the abovementioned methods, and it would look something like thisp  precodebool readMAINKEYint start, int stop codepre  pNow I have already done this, and even though I do not find it very elegant, I guess I can keep it for the time being. p  pHowever, I feel that I need a better approach for handling the reading inside of each section, and my main issue is stronghow should I store the keywords herestrong Should  they be stored as arrays within a local namespace in the input class or maybe as static variables in the class Or should they be defined locally inside relevant functions Should I use enums The questions are manyp  pNow Ive started by defining the subkeywords locally inside each codereadMAINKEYcode method, but I found this to be less than optimal. Ideally I want to reuse as much code as possible inside each of these methods, calling upon a common codereadSECTIONcode method, and my current approach seems to lead to much code duplication and potential for error in programming. I guess the smartest thing to do would simply be to remove all the currently 8 different codereadMAINKEYcode methods, and use the same function for handling all kinds of keywords. There is also the possibility for having subsubkeywords etc. as well i.e. a more general nested approach, so I think maybe this is the way to go, but I am unsure on how it would be best to implement itp  ul lipOnce Ive processed a keyword at the bottom level, the program will expect a particular format of the following lines depending on the actual keyword. In principle each keyword will be handled differently, but here there is also potential for some code reuse by defining different types of keywords depending on what the program expects to do after triggering the reading of it. Common task include e.g. parsing an integer or a double array, but in principle it could be anythingpli lipIf a keyword for some reason cannot be correctly processed, the program should attempt as far as possible to use default values instead of terminating the program if reasonable, but an error message should be written to a logfile. For optional keywords, default values will of course also be used.pli ul  pIn order to summarise, therefore, my main questions are the followingp  pstrong1. Do you think think my approach of storing the relevant lines in a codestdvectorltstdstringgtcode to be reasonablestrong p  pThis will of course require me to do a lot of indexing work to keep track of where in the vector the different keywords are located. Or should I work more directly with the original codestdifstreamcode object Or something elsep  pstrong2. Given such a vector storing the lines of the text file, how I can I best go about detecting the keywords and start reading the information following themstrongp  pHere I will need to take account of possible ordering and whether a keyword is required or not. Also, I need to check if the lines following each bottom level keyword is in the format expected in each case. p  pOne idea Ive had is to store the keywords in different containers depending on whether they are optional or not or maybe use objects of type codestdmapltstdstring,boolgtcode, and then remove them from the containers if correctly processed, but I am not sure exactly how I should go about it..p  pI guess there is really a thousand different ways one could answer these questions, but I would be grateful if someone more experienced could share some ideas on how to proceed. Is there e.g. a standard way of doing such things Of course, a lot of details will also depend on the concrete application, but I think the general format indicated here can be used in a lot of different applications without a lot of tinkering if programmed in a good wayp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOk, so let my try to be more concrete. My current application is supposed to be a reservoir simulator, so as part of the input I need information about the gridmesh, about rock and fluid properties, about wellsboundary conditions throughout the simulation and so on. At the moment Ive been thinking about using almost the same setup as the commercial Eclipse simulator when it comes to input, for details see  a hrefhttppetrofaq.orgwikiEclipseInputData relnofollowhttppetrofaq.orgwikiEclipseInputDataa.p  pHowever, I will probably change things a bit, so nothing is set in stone. Also, I am interested in making a more general KeywordReader class that with slight modifications can be adapted for use in other applications as well, at least it can be done in a reasonable amount of time.p  pAs an example, I can post the current code that does the initial scan of the text file and locates the positions of the main keywords.

Negative 220 pstrongEDITstrong Added the solution to my code, as suggested by Martijn Pieters. p  pIm writing a web application that should have an image upload feature. Actually it is uploading directly to imgur.com through their api. So far I can upload an image to imgur through the terminal by running my python script. But I want the user to be able to select an image through an html form. All I actually need I think is the path for the file, then I have a script that converts the image to base64. As I write this I realize that the script might only work when its run locally, and not from a browser. I have been googling for two days.

Negative 220 pId like to setup a macro to remove data from a range within a group of data tables that may change dynamically. For instance, the spreadsheet currently contains 16 data tables listed as L21, L22, L23.....L216.

I would also like to delete just the range[L2 number] within the table this is the same range name for all of the tables.p  pThere are also another type of tables that increment in the sheet as well L3L21, L3L22....L3L216.

Negative 220 pFrom the question the answer seems just codereloadDatacode. br This method starts the process that makes the tableview reload data from tableview from codenumberOfSectionscode to codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode. br The fact is that most of those methods are launched probably in the next runloop or codeCATransactioncode.bR Im trying to get the full size of the tableview to show all the cells thus avoiding the need of scrolling.br The tableView knows its content size only when it load the heightForRowAtIndexPath or the cells, so it seems to impossible to ask the table view for its codecontentSizecode right after codereloadDatacode.br It seems useless also to invalidate its intrinsic content size and force auto layout, or asking a codesizeToFitcode until it loads all the cells it doesnt know its size. Tried also with codesystemLayoutSizeFittingSizecodegiving codeUILayoutFittingExpandedSizecode with no success.p
Negative 220 pLets say I have a relatively complex storyboard with a login screen guarding access to a UITabBarController containing a couple of embedded UINavigationControllers and their children, like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com793Tx.png altA moderately complex storyboardp  pThe LoginViewController is the root VC, and decides if the user is logged in, either by checking stored credentials or asking for fresh ones. It then presents the UITabBarController as a modal.p  pThere are four scenariosp  p1 If the user starts the app from cold, they should see the ListViewController.p  p2 If the app is started from cold via a push notification regarding a Foo, they should go directly to the FooDetailViewController.p  p3 If the app is warmstarted via a push notification regarding a Foo, they should go directly to the FooDetailViewController, no matter what VC they were looking at when the app was backgrounded.p  p4 If the user warmstarts the app, they should go back to whatever VC they were looking at when the app was backgrounded.p  pWhere does the logic for all of this decisionmaking go If I put it in the AppDelegate, I end up trying to push view controllers onto my hierarchy before they exist codeWarning Attempt to present ViewControllerX on ViewControllerY whose view is not in the window hierarchycode. The UITabBarControllers viewWillAppear lifecycle method does not seem to be being called on a warm start, and putting logic in emeveryem child view controller to check if its been started from a push seems like coupling things that shouldnt be coupled and in practice seems to lead to corrupted navigation stacks.p  pHow does everyone else structure thisp

Negative 220 pSo, I am trying to utilize the bootstrap carousel to show content on the page.  The problem is, that when resizing the browser, the captions overlap the content.  I tried changing the captions to be fixed, but that doesnt fix emrimshotem the problem.  I thought about putting the captions right below the content and have it flow with it, but I would prefer it to sit on the bottom.  That way it is consistently in the same spot as the user goes from slide to slide.  I tried putting the content down with the caption, but the content goes through the top of the browser.  You will see most of the issue while viewing the 3rd slide.p  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idcarouselexamplegeneric classcarousel slide dataridecarousel dataintervalfalsegt     lt Indicators gt     ltol classcarouselindicatorsgt         ltli datatargetcarouselexamplegeneric dataslideto0 classactivegtltligt         ltli datatargetcarouselexamplegeneric dataslideto1gtltligt         ltli datatargetcarouselexamplegeneric dataslideto2gtltligt     ltolgt      lt Wrapper for slides gt     ltdiv classcarouselinnergt         ltdiv classitem activegt             ltdiv classslideBackgroundgt                 ltdiv classslideSpacergtltdivgt                 ltdiv classslideContentgt                     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

This is a bit trickier as one carousel only has one set of indicators and I cant move them into each item like I could the captions.p

Negative 220 pI am trying to design a UI in which there will be a row of rectangular elements. I need some way to determine how many elements are in the row and if this number exceeds 5, to create a new row. I would just hard code it, but the problem is that its future customers who will potentially be adding rectangles to the row and I want their only job to be adding the rectangles and not having to worry about creating new rows, etc. Is there a straightforward way to do this with QML Or even some way to determine the number of elements within a row p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 220 pI am working on an application in WPF using Vlc.DotNet. I was having an issue with the video playing back with a terrible frame rate on my laptop. p  pAfter some research I identified that the issue is related to the CPU throttling down. If the laptop power profile is in BatterySaver mode it has the issue. If I switch it to performance, everything works fine. It seems to me like in BatterySaver mode it allows the processor to throttle down, and for some reason doesnt throttle back up correctly when the application needs it to. Is there anyway I can fix this issue p  pI tried setting the priority with the code below and it didnt seem to make a difference. p  precodeSystem.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess.PriorityClass  ProcessPriorityClass.High codepre  pVlc.DotNet updates and ImageSource with the next rendered image.

As soon as it starts playing, AKA updating the image on the GUI at 30fps, the frame rate of the entire application drops down to around 5fps. p

Table1 is basically a table with the fields id, fn, ln, email. id is an autogenerated ID representing the entry and fnln represent the firstlast name, respectively, of the persons entry. Expected output is as coded, e.g.,...p  precodeJohn Doe has 3 possible duplicates 1342, 3652, 98325 John Doe has 3 possible duplicates 986, 3652, 98325 John Doe has 3 possible duplicates 986, 1342, 98325 John Doe has 3 possible duplicates 986, 1342, 3652 Sam Jones has 0 possible duplicates  Jane Smith has 2 possible duplicates 234, 10562 Jane Smith has 2 possible duplicates 155, 10562 Jane Smith has 2 possible duplicates 155, 234 codepre  pThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the ids that appear to be duplicates to each person. A possible duplicate is a scenario in which another entry in the same table appears to share the same name or email. For example, there could be 4 John Does and 3 Jane Smiths in the table based on name alone.p  pIdeally, only one SQL query is required to reduce the roundtrip induced by the recordset call but Access is limited compared to regular SQL Server as far as features and Im not sure what Im missing that might help speed this up.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pUsing the SQL Fiddle by Abecee, I was able to get a faster query. However, I am now encountering two problems as a result.p  pThe big picture view is still the same. We are looking for possible duplicates based on first name, last name, and email address. However, we also added a search criteria, which are the lines wrapped inside of codeIf searchstring ltgt  Then ... End Ifcode. Also, note that the email info is now being pulled from a separate table called EmailTable with the fields id, IndividualID representing Table1.id, and email.p  pMods The updated query is similar but slightly different from the original query above.

Negative 220 pI tried to create an authentication system in aspx using Windows Authentication. It seems to be the default mode for authenticating users in an intranet, for a company using Windows PCs. I enabled Windows Authentication for my site in IIS, and disabled the other types of Authentications. This is my Web.config filep  precodeltsystem.webgt     ltauthentication modeWindows gt     ltcompilation debugtrue targetFramework4.5 gt     lthttpRuntime targetFramework4.5 gt ltsystem.webgt codepre  pWhat I have is a feedback provided by this line in my code always falsep  precodeResponse.WriteUser.Identity.IsAuthenticated.ToString codepre  pIm not sure Im doing all in the right way, but Ive read many tutorials and all seems so easy... so, what I miss to do Im doing something wrongp  pI havent found anything that helped me in the implementation, simply all what I wrote seems to do nothing. Uh, also I dont see the Windows Auth Dialogp
Negative 220 pIm making a big data download application. So far Im able to manage the pause, resume and stop of simultaneous downloads. I want to be able to leave the app kill it in the middle of a download and restart it after I relaunch it. But when I kill the app, launch it again and try to resume it the downloads I want to resume are not resumed, are restarted. And it is suppose to know automatically with the URL if the download is started or not.  Im subclassing as a singleton AFHTTPRequestOperationManager class. And I think my problem is there. This object is lost when I restart the application and a new operation manager is created instead, and I think that is why Im losing the track of the downloads and is creating a new temporary file and restarting the download from the beginning. How can I get the track of my downloads back when I relaunch the app Is it possible to serialize the operation manager and store it in nsuserdefaultsp  pThanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 220 pI have a row of five boxes. When you click on any except the first one, the clicked box fades out, the ones before it slide to the right, and a new box appears on the far left as the new first element.p  p1 Instead of prepending the body with the div with classes primaryfade, primary, and box, Id rather prepend with the element I just clicked without the class fadeout but with new classes primary and primaryfade while still retaining the class box.p  p2 In my fiddle I realize that any box that previously had the class primary and then moved to a nonfirst position no longer triggers the animation if clicked on again. I dont know why that is, but Id like any element to move back to the first position on click regardless.p  pIm sure my jQuery can be written more elegantly. Im not very experienced with it.

Negative 220 pAfter logging in to our ClickOnce app, the icon in the task bar vanishes.  p  pSome details This app, which well call ThisApp, was originally written in .NET 2.0 VB and has been migrated forward to .NET 4.0  But this issue has been persistent all along the way.  In Windows 7 and I think it did the same thing in Vista and XP... it behaves like thisp  pWhen you go to Start   All Programs  ThisApp and first start it up, the icon appears in the task bar, as it should.  You are first presented with a logon screen.  If you enter proper credentials, the logon screen is replaced by the actual UI for the app, but at the same time, the icon in the task bar simply vanishes.  You can still see the UI screen for the app, but the task bar icon is gone.p  pAt that point, if you should happen to minimize the app, there is literally no way to bring it back, other than going again to    All Programs  ThisApp, which gives you a notice that says An instance of ThisApp is already running, but at least at that point it restores the icon to the task bar.p  pIf, just after logging in and while the icon is missing, you should happen to click on another window and send ThisApp to the background, the icon remains missing.  But, if you then click on ThisApps window and bring it back to the front, the icon suddenly returns to the task bar.p  pIve stepped through the initial logon process in debug.  Ive looked at trace logs.  Ive looked at the Windows event log.  Ive spent time on Google. I can find NO clues as to why this is happening. Its been going on for years and never been enough of an issue to warrant any developer time on it.  But now finally a large enough client is complaining about this, and we need to finally figure this out.  Ive found a lot of questions about ClickOne apps and their icons, but Ive not found one that addresses this particular issue.p  pAnyone ever seen something like this Ever dealt with it  Any ideasp  pThanksp  pstrongEDIT  MORE INFOstrongp  pI am still stumped on this.  Heres what Ive been able to figure outp  pFIRSTp  pWhen the app is first initiated, a splash page is shown while the app checks configs, tests connections to the DB, loads user cached data, etc. While the splash page is visible, the icon shows in the taskbar just fine.  Once the initial setup is done, the splash page is hidden.  At this point, the taskbar icon goes away.p  pSECONDp  pRight after the splash page is hidden, the login form is initialized and shown.  When shown, the icon again becomes visible in the taskbar.  it stays there until after the user is validates and the form is closed, at which point the icon is gone again from the taskbar.p  pTHIRDp  pAs soon as the login form is closed, the splash page is again shows while the more configuration is done and a sync between the app client and server takes place.  When the splash page is shown, the taskbar icon comes back.  As soon as the sync is complete the splash page is hidden, and the taskbar icon is gone again.p  pFOURTHp  pAs soon as the second splash page is hidden, we then show the Main Form.  At this point, I would expect the taskbar icon to show again.  But... it does not.  I have been comparing properties of the Login form and the Main form at the point they become visible to see if I can spot any differences that might explain why one shows the icon and the other does not. I am not seeing anything obvious.p  pCODEp  pBelow is a screenshot of the code that creates and loads the Login form, with an arrow pointing to the line where the form becomes visible AND the icon appears in the taskbar.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combeNsy.png altcode that creates and loads the login form  taskbar icon showsp  pBelow is a screenshot of the code that creates and loads the Main form, with an arrow pointing to the line where the I would EXPECT the taskbar icon to appear. The form itself does appear at this line,  but the icon does not.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com30T1a.png altcode that creates and loads the main form  taskbar icon does not showp  pA couple more thingsp  ol liThe icon is set in the properties of the applicationli liIn both forms, ShowIcon and ShowInTaskbar are both trueli ol  pAny ideas are welcomep

Negative 220 pI have a list that Im iterating over and I want to print out only matching items in the list I know this is trivial but its just a learning exercise for rx java.

I just want to perform some codevoidcode operation on the observable at the end of the chain, but I like the syntax of having all of the operations together before the codesubscribeOncode call.p

Negative 220 pI am working with HBase DB through Phoenix, and I need to compare two Strings of epoch timestamp. the method tonumberts takes too long to compute for big amount of data.p  pWhat is the best practice for comparing two string of epoch timestamps without converting them into number or any other conversion.p  pUsing string comparison works well for number of the same length e.g 456 lt 654. But for number of different length it might fail, e.g 456 lt 65.p  pI considered planting zeroes before each number in the insertion progress so that all strings will be of the same length, but there must be a better way to do it.p
Negative 220 pI recently built a Outlook 2010 add in in C using the .NET 4.0 Client profile framework in VS2010 but I would like to use the System.Net.Http library, which is under the .NET 4.5 framework and so I installed VS2012 to be able to do this. However, I only have Outlook 2010 installed on my machine and so want to be able to run the addin from VS2012 in Outlook 2010 but Im unable to do so at the moment as when I go to debug this in VS2012 it says that I dont have the correct version of Outlook. So far in VS2012 I can only see options to build Outlook 2013 addins with the .NET 4.5 framework and not Outlook 2010, which can only been seen under the .NET 4.0 framework. Is there any way I can somehow use the System.Net.Http library with my Outlook 2010 addin and have it available to run on Outlook 2010p

Negative 220 pIm looking for a way to broadcast data over wifi to exchange data between unpaired devices. Im imagining a protocol similar to how low energy Bluetooth sends data via advertising packets. I would use BT LE, but I need a wider range and something that can go through at least 12 walls. I would also prefer not to have to connect to each discovered device before transmitting like in direct wifi, since eventually this application could have many 10s or 100s of available devices to interact with.  Can anyone point me in the direction of a library or framework that would enable me to do this p  pThe end goal is to implement this on a mobile device, but at this point I cant find anything that allows for this type of broadcasting.  Any ideas would be of great help. p  pThanks. p

Negative 220 pIm developing an app in angular and there are a few forms dotted around different pages that have large drop downs for county, country, city etc. It makes sense to use either ngrepeat or ngoptions and store the options in a model so instead of repeating myself I thought it would be a good idea to have a single location for the model.p  pIm just researching different approaches to do so.p  pCurrently Im thinking of a factory like codelangAddresscode with methods like codegetCitiesencode, codegetCountiesencode, codegetCountriesencode etc.p  pAnd a model may look like thisp  precodevar countries       en [UK, SPAIN, JAPAN, BELGIUM],     es [UK, ESPAA, JAPN, BLGICA]   getCountrieses [UK, ESPAA, JAPN, BLGICA] codepre  pI could the use this array to populate my options in my dropdown.p  pAny ideas p  pThanks, Jamesp

Negative 220 pMore and more I see new labels for the same solutions but with different names. In this case why we cannot simply say that the Execute Aroud idiom is the same that the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStrategypattern relnofollowStrategy design patternap  pWhen I read the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3420161140754Jon Skeets answera to the question What is the Execute Around idiom, he states thatp  blockquote   pits the pattern where you write a strongmethod to do things which are always requiredstrong, e.g. resource allocation and cleanup, and make the caller pass in strongwhat we want to do with the resourcestrong.p blockquote  pIn this case jonskeet uses a codeexecuteWithFileString filename, InputStreamAction actioncode method as an example of the method that strongdoes things which are always requiredstrong and the interface codeInputStreamActioncode as an abstraction over strongwhat we want to do with the resourcestrong.p  precode  public interface InputStreamAction          void useStreamInputStream stream throws IOException    codepre  pComparing this with the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStrategypattern relnofollowStratey design patterna why we cannot just say that the interface codeInputStreamActioncode  defines a family of algorithms And, each implementation of the interface codeInputStreamActioncode corresponds to a concrete strongstrategystrong encapsulating an algorithm. Finally these algorithms are interchangeable and we can make use of the codeexecuteWithFilecode with any of those strategies.p  pSo, why cant I interpret the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3420161140754Jon Skeets answera as an example of the application of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStrategypattern relnofollowStratey design patternap  pBy the way, which of the idioms came first The Execute Around or the Strategy design patternp  pAlthough the Execute Around idiom is usually related with a functional style programming, the only documentation that I found about it was in a hrefhttpbooks.google.ptbooksaboutSmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.htmlidPQx2QgAACAAJ relnofollowSmalltalk Best Practice Patternsa book from 1997 in the scope of the Smalltalk programming language, which follows an OO approach.p  pBecause Design patterns describe stronggeneral solutionsstrong to strongrecurrent problemsstrong, then we can say that the Execute Around and Strategy are both the strongsame solutionstrong to solve strongdifferent problemsstrong. So, I ask strongdo we really need a different namestrong to identify the same solution, when it is applied to a different problemp  pAlthough I agree with iluwatars a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29166024whytheexecutearoudidiomisnotconsideredastrategydesignpattern2917232629172326answera that this is strongthe way to communicate different ideasstrong, I still think that I could transmit the idea of the Execute Around just telling that I used a Strategy to specify what I want to do with a resource, which is always setup and cleaned in the same manner.p  pSo the Execute Around idiom is reducing ambiguity and thats good, but at same time is proliferating the names of design patterns And, is that a good practice p

Negative 220 pI have no idea how to phrase this correctly so please bear with me. Working in C .NET, I inherit a class which contains a function which returns an object for unmanaged functions.

Negative 220 pI am building a ToDo List type app, and I would like to place an editable checkbox in each cell in the UITableView. I want the user to be able to mark the item as completed by tapping the checkbox in the tableView. They also need to be able to tap in the cell, outside of the checkbox, and segue to a detail view.p  pSo far I have created a custom cell class. The plan was to display an image of an unchecked box, and when the user taps the image, the image is swapped with a different image of a checked box and the item is updated appropriately.  p  pI tried putting a Touch Gesture Recognizer on the image, but it didnt work.  Whenever the image on the cell is tapped, it just segues to the detail view. Then I found an article somewhere that says to create UIView nested inside the cell and link the Touch Gesture to that.  So I tried that, but now it only work intermittently. Sometimes it recognizes the touch correctly, and sometimes it just segues to the detail view.p  pIve seen this idea in the Wunderlist app. p  pHow do I go about implementing this correctlyp

Negative 220 pI understand that there is no support for recursive mutexes in Go and that a lot of folks consider these dangerous, and that channels are the preferred way to implement complex concurrency patterns.p  pHowever, I cannot figure out any sensible way to implement a very common concurrency pattern  that of the reentrant or recursive critical section.p  pRoughly   goroutines A and B will compete for a lock over a critical section say some state in a struct needs to be atomically modified.  Lets say A receives the lock.  However, A will recurse, possibly needing to enter the critical section many times.  When it has exited the critical section as it has entered it, goroutine B will get the lock, etc.p  pI want to implement this with channels or in any way possible in Go otherwise, without having to pass some string or token back and forth through the whole call tree of functions that might pass through the critical section there is no goroutine id available., and without having messyexpensive stack introspection necessary using coderuntimecode package.p  pHow can this be donep

Negative 220 pOkay, so I am pulling my hair out with this one. I am trying to make a function that will shuffle a virtual deck of cards. I saw examples online, but they were written in some syntax I am unfamiliar with. I really couldnt understand what was going on so I tried to write my own. Anyway, the way I am going about it, I am making a duplicate array and then randomly picking cards out of the first array and putting them into the second array one by one, then deleting the randomly selected card. Heres my code. The function is stopping once the length of the original array reaches 26.p  precodeshuffleDeck function deck          var newDeck  deck         for i  0 iltnewDeck.lengthi             randomIndex  Math.floorMath.random  deck.length             newDeck[i]  deck[randomIndex]             deck.splicerandomIndex,1               console.logdeck.length                   return newDeck      codepre

backgrounds, gradients etcli ul  pNone of the above solve the problem. p  pIs it my old time scripting or Explorer or bothp  pAlso, the script is only intended for fun hence no backwards compatibility provision.p  pThanks in advance for any answers.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction     Starfield 2004

I dont see the reason why the printing is being canceled.li liWhen the invoice is printed and the disconnect method strongis not calledstrong, the printer apparently waits for more data for a few seconds eg. 15 seconds. On the models with status LED the light is on. After that pause the printer is usable again. I believe that printer somehow automatically resets the connection itself and socket remains connected.li ul  h2Questionh2  pHow can I close the connection between Android device and bluetooth     printer so the printing process will complete successfully and the printer will be ready to print a new invoice without a delayp  hr  h2Updateh2  pIve left Bluetooth socket connected while the app is running. After that Ive changed the procedure so that QR code strongis not printed laststrong  at first theres some text printed, then bitmap and then some more text. In that combination theres no lag between printing and printer does not hang.p  pThat makes me wonder if printer stays in raster bit image mode. Ive calculated everything again and the command is valid.p  pHex command for printing a bitmap is code0x1D 0x76 0x30 m xL xH yL yH d1...dkcode. If used for bitmap with dimensions 255x255 px the hex byte array command is p  precode0x1D 0x76 0x30 0x00 0x20 0x00 0xFF 0x00 bitmap[8160] codepre  pwhere codebitmap[8160]code is series of bitmap bytes with length of 8160 that equals 0x20  0xFF.p  pHowever, when the printing is done init command is sent to printer so either way the printer strongshould resetstrong. Or does itp  pAnother thing that Ive noticed are strongline feedsstrong. If they are sent after every printing part P like P1, feed, P2, feed, P3, feed ... the result would look more like P1, P2, P3, feed, feed, feed. Why is that sop

Negative 220 pSo, Ive just began learning codeAngularcode and my question is what ways or the best practices are there for injecting helper functions into AngularJS I often need to include functions to assist my controller, but I have read online that the controller should hold as little logic as possible, which means they should be injected into the controller and declared in the module fat module, skinny controller. p  pAs such, I have been primarily injecting functions like thisp  h3provide.valueh3  precodeprovide.valueMySQLtoJS, functiondatetimeString      var t  datetimeString.split[ ]     var d  new Datet[0], t[1]1, t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5]     return d  codepre  pThis uses the codeprovidecode service to create a codevaluecode that can be injected in my controller. However, for more elaborate functions, such as those that require an injectable, I have been using thisp  h3codeFactorycode providerh3  precode.factoryconvertMySQLToJS, [moment, functionmoment      return functionarrayInput          if Array.isArrayarrayInput              for var i  0 i lt arrayInput.length i                  var t  arrayInput[i].begindatetime.split[ ]                 var start  new Datet[0], t[1]1, t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5]                 arrayInput[i].begindatetime  start                 var t  arrayInput[i].enddatetime.split[ ]                 var end  new Datet[0], t[1]1, t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5]                 arrayInput[i].enddatetime  end                   Also create the moment message                 if arrayInput[i].begindatetime gt new Date                      arrayInput[i].message  Begins at   momentarrayInput[i].begindatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a   and likely ends at   momentarrayInput[i].enddatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a                                  else                      arrayInput[i].message  Began at   momentarrayInput[i].begindatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a   and likely ended at   momentarrayInput[i].enddatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a                                           return arrayInput               ] codepre  pHowever, factories are often used for their service and properties like codehttpcode, or so Ive been told. So Ive been recently suggested by some people that I should be including them in the coderuncode configuration block which seems a bit weird to me by using coderootScopecode and giving it that property for the function I need. Since Im new to Angular and Ive found documentation rather lacking, Im wondering how am I supposed to inject helper functions correctly into codeAngularcode, if there is a correct wayp

Negative 220 pFirst of all I would like to set the ground so you can understand the nature of my question. I am currently developing a web application which turns a free hotspot into a paid one. The payment process is handbyhand and the end customer receives a coupon with a code generated by the web application. Each voucher code will have an expiration time.p  pWhat I would like to do is to, somehow, keep track of the time each code was active on the network so that the end customer can log off, come back and use the network with the time that is left for his voucher code.p  pI assume this is quite challenging and requires working with the session keeping of the router itself Mikrotik, Meraki etc so I would like to know if there is a more universal approach to this using a cookie.p  pThank you in advance.p

Any advice or tips would be appreciatedp  precode.data  For main function initStr .asciiz The initial array isn endStr .asciiz Insertion sort is finishedn   For printarray arrPrintStart .asciiz [
