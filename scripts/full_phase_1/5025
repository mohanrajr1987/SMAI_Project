Then, I am using the OleDbCommand to get a IDataReader with the spreadsheet data. p  pThere are several cells in the Excel sheet with text contents of more than 256 characters. But, once this gets uploaded to the database table using SqlBulkCopy, I only see first 255 characters from these excel cells in the database. The database table fields are 5000 characters long. p  pDoes SqlBulkCopy limit the field size Thanksp

Negative 5025 pWe have stumbled upon such a problem.p  pWe are developing an application for travelling. To make sure the user doesnt spend much money on roaming charges in our app we decided to implement a settings option for user to view cached maps only. So we let the user decide whether he wants to load the maps from internet or he wants to save money and view cached maps stored in LibraryCachesMapTilesMapTiles.sqlitedb.p  pWe cant find a way to implement this. Is there any way to disable network programmatically in this case Or force MapKit use cached tiles only We thought about changing APN programmatically for this option to force MapKit go offline. Is it possible to change APN programmaticallyp  pThank youp

Negative 5025 pOkay, I have enough code that I probably shouldnt post the code directly, but Im not sure where the problem lies within it.p  pThe page in question is at letterlyyours.comdesign.php.  How its supposed to work is that you type in a word, press Submit, and then little photos of each letter appear belowthat you can scroll up and down.  In addition, if you click on a thumbnail, fancybox opens to show the full image.p  pThe problem is that in Chrome, all the scrolling arrows are disabled.  Also in IE 67 it works in IE 8, fancybox only works for the first thumbnail in the list.  Isnt that weirdp  pAnyway, I suspect the problem may be caused by something hackish I had to do to fix another problem.  For a list of photos, I had originally used 2D arrays, like photos[4][6], but this only worked in Firefox, so I changed it to something like evalphotosnumber[index], which seemed to make it work in IE except for the aforementioned problems.p  pThe link to the file with all the javascript code is a hrefhttpletterlyyours.comjcarouseldesign.js.php relnofollowhttpletterlyyours.comjcarouseldesign.js.phpap  pHeres the codep  precodephotos0  [ url photosthumbA 1.jpg, title A 1, url photosthumbA 2.jpg, title A 2, ... ] ... ... photos25  [ url photosthumbZ 1.jpg, title Z 1, ... ]  jQuerydocument.readyfunction   jQuerycreate.submitfunctionevent      var word  jQueryword.val     event.preventDefault     jQueryul.unbind     jQuerycreation.html     jQuerycreation.csswidth, Math.max122, 75word.length     for var a  0 a lt word.length a                  jQuerycreation.appendltul classjcarousel jcarouselskintango idcarousel  a  gtltulgt         var total  evalphotos  parseIntword.toUpperCase.charCodeAta65  .length         for var b  0 b lt total b                          var url  evalphotos  parseIntword.toUpperCase.charCodeAta65  [b].url             var urlfull  url.replacethumb,              jQuerycarousel  a.appendltligtlta idthumb  b   href  urlfull  gtltdiv stylewidth 75px height 113px backgroundimage url  url  gtltdivgtltagtltligt             jQueryathumb  b.fancybox                 transitionIn elastic,                 transitionOut elastic,                 hideOnContentClick true                                          jQuerycarousel  a.jcarousel             vertical true,             scroll 1,             itemVisibleInCallback functioncarousel, li, index, state                  jQueryli.parent.dataimage, jQueryli.childrena.childrendiv.cssbackgroundimage.replaceg,                                     jQuerycreation.appendlta idorder hreforderformgtltimg width122 height24 srcimagesbuttonorder.png tabindex3 altOrder Yours gtltagt     jQueryaorder.fancybox     hideOnContentClick false,     transitionIn fade,     frameWidth auto,     title Order   word  ,     overlayShow true,     overlayOpacity 0.8,     overlayColor black,     onStart function          jQuerylist.html         jQuerycost.htmlword.length   photos at 6.00 per photo ltbr gtTotal   word.length6         jQueryformcontactform.unbind         jQueryformcontactform.submitfunctionevent              jQuery.fancybox.showActivity             jQuery.postcontact.php, jQueryformcontactform.serialize, function                                  jQuery.fancyboxjQuerydivthanks                              event.preventDefault                  var photolist           for a  0 a lt word.length a                          jQuerylist.appendltdiv stylefloat left width 75px height 113px backgroundimage   jQuerycarousel  a.dataimage  gt             photolist  jQuerycarousel  a.dataimage                      jQueryphotonames.valphotolist                 jQueryword.keypressfunctionevent      var letter  event.which     if letter  8 ampamp letter  0                  if letter lt 97             letter  32         if letter gt 97 ampamp letter lt 122                          event.preventDefault                         jQueryword.selectfunctionevent      event.preventDefault   codepre

Negative 5025 pNot sure if the title makes sense, but heres what Im doing. Im using AutoMapper to map my Entity Framework Entities to my DTO objects and vice versa. The issue comes when I try to map the DTO data to the EF entity. Theres not a property to property mapping for the EntityKey. To fix this, I do some like the followingp  precode        Mapper.CreateMapltVideoDTO, Videogt             .ForMemberdest gt dest.EntityKey, opt gt    opt.ResolveUsingltVideoEntityKeyResolvergt codepre  pThe VideoEntityKeyResolver class looks likep  precodepublic class VideoEntityKeyResolver  ValueResolverltVideoDTO, EntityKeygt      protected override EntityKey ResolveCoreVideoDTO source              EntityKey key  new EntityKeyEntityFrameworkTestingEntities.Videos,             VideoId, source.VideoId         return key       codepre  pI was wondering if there was a more generic way of doing this where I could have 1 class with a constructor that takes the Entity Set Name, Key Property Name, and Key Value in a constructor.p  pIve thought about just adding an EntityKey property to my DTO objects that sounds a lot like crossing the streams as the whole point of creating the DTO objects was to severe the tie to my data layer in the rest of my application.p  pOn a completely unrelated note I can create a new question if needed, where exactly do I need to define my mappings when using AutoMapper Currently Im doing it in the constructor of my context object which is my EF repository object, but I believe thats rather costly and just not correct, though, it works.p

Negative 5025 pWe provide the ability to submit images to a users gallery.p  pWhile the normal method we have employed works just fine, some people will upload multiple files, which can take a long time, and is annoying in the selection process one at a time.p  pI started writing an alternate method using Gears for those that have it. Primarily the goal is to replace the file selection, and provide a progress indicator for the upload which helps mitigate the frustration when uploading multiple big files.p  pI have all this done.p  pI referenced the Movie Uploader code here httpuploadmovietool.appspot.com which demonstrates uploading files using the chunk method. I have it uploading correctly, the server is accepting the chunks, however I am running into a problem trying to handle the incoming data with PHP.p  pEach chunk is a seperate request to the script, and none of the data is registered in PHPs normal incoming data vars codePOSTcode,codeGETcode,codeFILEScode, etc. I have finally been able to get the data from sucking on codeGLOBALS[HTTPRAWPOSTDATA]code however even when appending the data onto the same file, the image is never complete. It will show portions, but something is always wrong.p  p..That being said.. if there is an easier way to post files to the script, while still having access to progress updates, I would love to hear it.p  pWhen I started this project, I had assumed that Gears would provide me with a way to do multipart post with files like normal, and simply give me an event fire on an interval with progress information. If this is somehow possible and Ive obviously missed it, please let me know.p  pTo be clear We emareem aware that HTML5 supports progression mechanics, and are prepared to implement based on it as soon as it is viable. p  pFor further referencep  pThe headers that Im sending with the post as per the google movie uploader example arep  precodeRequest.setRequestHeader ContentDisposition, attachment filename  self.fileName    Request.setRequestHeader ContentType, applicationoctetstream  Request.setRequestHeader ContentRange, bytes   byteRange  codepre  pThanks to anyone who can help.p

Negative 5025 pIve been having some trouble with FreeBSD and large mmaps. Linux does not show the same problems.p  pOn program startup it can always get the 1 GB map. However, theres a reload operation where the file is replaced and remapped. The new map is usually just a little bigger each time so it doesnt fit neatly into the old mmap location. This remap often fails on FreeBSD but hardly ever on Linux. It fails more often on Linuxes using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAddressspacelayoutrandomization relnofollowASLRa. Does FreeBSD use ASLRp  pI emthinkem this is because of libraries loading other libraries and also memory allocations done during the program run that fragment the virtual memory space.

Negative 5025 pI am trying to a save a list into a file in a way that when I load and read the file again I get my lists as they are. In other words,the datatype doesnt change while saving and loading. Because right now, I use write to save my list into a file, and when I try to load it back into memory I get strings rather than real lists. is there a way to convert them back to lists after loading or should I change the way I save my lists into a file.Please note that I dont want to use Pickle. Thanks  EDIT my problem with pickle is that I have to add my lists step by step in different part of the code.Thus, I dont have all the lists at once so I can pickle them. This is the problem that I had.It gives me wrong answer, I guess it is because pickle requires all the info in one place and adds them to file at once.   I have only integers in my lists.p
Negative 5025 pIm migrating some existing products to use WiX 3.5 Im using the Votive VS integration. Some of the items Im installing need to be registered with a thirdparty framework. The requirement is that I must call a Register method in a third party .NET assembly to inform it of the presence of the items Im installing. It expects a COM ProgID.p  pI cant figure out how to get WiX to do this. I thought about creating a binary Custom Action, but I cant find a way of passing a parameter a string containing the ProgID into that custom action. I dont want to hardcode it because I need this to be reusable code. I cant see a way to do this declaratively because the Register function is a black box.p  pMan this is a steep learning curve.

I switched them and it was always the second which was corrupted.p  pFor example, I called the initializer with these example arguments different from those in the debugger screenshots, and the error occured in the same wayp  precodeMapper mapper  [[Mapper alloc] initWithSourceFrameCGRectMake0, 0, 100, 100 mappedFrameCGRectMake0,0, 200,200] codepre  pThe method declarationp  precodeid initWithSourceFrameCGRect sourceViewFrame mappedFrameCGRect mappedViewFrame codepre  pIm somewhat new to ObjectiveC, so I am sorry if I missed something obvious. However, it looks strange that an argument does not keep valid during method invocation.p

Negative 5025 pWere accessing a shared git repository via file paths, for various reasons Ill omit for now, created with sharedgroup.p  pWe have various unix groups but all share a common group. If I run a chgrp R on the git repository everyone can read from it, but if someone writes to it more often than not new files are created which do not use the common group.p  pThis problem appears to be because our primary group is not the shared one and if we run a newgrp all seems to work well.p  pThere are issues with this approach though newgrp is slow and it spawns a new shell, which makes me think calling it in a .bashprofile would be a bad idea, without even considering whether or not wed want emallem our new files to use the common group. Relying on memory to run it before doing any git work seems like a recipe for disaster too though.p  pSo... any suggestions Thanks in advance.p

If it exists it verifies it with the database, refreshes its expiration, and then adds it to the codeControllercode codeViewDatacode collection so it can be accessed by codeActionResultcodes. If it doesnt exist, then it redirects the user to the login page.p  pThe filter half works because when an HTTP cookie emdoesem exist and it attempts to grab the concrete object out of the database, it crashes with the above error message.p  pBecause of the number of layers that are in place, Im gonna go ahead and post the code to all of them, codeVerifyCookieAttribute.cscode, codeCookieRepository.cscode and codeRepository1.cscode. Lastly, although it probably does not make any difference, the error occurs in the codeSelectSinglecode method of codeRepository1.cscode.p  pDependency Injection is by Ninject 2.2.1.0.

Negative 5025 pIm writing an image viewer as a custom Qt widget see a hrefhttpsgithub.comdovQviv relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdovQviva and I now got stuck on the question of how to make my widget notify a parent QScrollArea of changes in the view port, and thus to tell it to move the scrollbars. E.g. if the image viewer changes the zoom factor as the result of a keypress then the scrollbars need to change their page size. p  pOne way of doing it would be to have the widget explicitly check if the parent is a QScrollArea and then make an explicit call to its methods to notify it on any changes. p  pOf course I also need to connect the changes of the ScrollArea to the internal view of the image, but that is a different question. And I need to cut the infinite recursion where the widget reports changes to the scrollbar that report changes to the widget etc.p  pemEdit 2015 Wednesday GMTUTC trying to clarify to Vjo and myself what I need.emp  pWhat I am trying to achieve is the equivalent of a Gtk widget that has been assigned a pair of GtkAdjustments that are connected to a horizontal and vertical scrollbar. In my widget GtkImageViewer, that QvivImageViewer is based on, whenever I change the view due to some internal event e.g. a keypress I update the GtkAdjustments. The scrollbars are connected to such changes and are update accordingly. GtkImageViewer also listens to the GtkAdjustment changes, and thus if the user scrolls the scrollbars, the GtkImageViewer is updated with this information and can change its view. My question is whether there is anything similar to GtkAdjustment in Qt that you can connect to for changes, and update in which case the update will be propagated to all the listenersp  pThus I dont expect the ScrollArea to be part of QvivImageViewer, but if the user has placed QvivImageViewer within a ScrollArea, I want bidirectional communication with it so that the scrollbars reflect the internal state of the widget.p

Negative 5025 pHaving seen how a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCommandpattern relnofollowCommand patterna was used in a previous project, I can understand how it can be useful in multithreaded parallel programming, because Commands can be executed in different threads. When data needs to be passed between commands, the data can be stored in a shared memory and a pointer or handle to that data can be passed to an invoker on a differeht thread.p  pHowever, Decorator pattern seems to have the restriction that everything must happen on a single thread, because the decorator has to call the delegate directly, implying they must be on the same thread.p  pIs my understanding of this limitation correct On the contrary, is it possible to run decorator on multiple threadsp  hr  pWhat Im trying to implement is a pipeline that processes a stream of data.p  ul liTo implement as Command pattern, its codeexecutecode method would take two arguments a buffer for input and a buffer for output.li liTo implement as Decorator pattern, its codegetdatacode method would call its delegate to get the result of the previous step, apply its own processing, and return the result to the caller.li ul  pHowever after I have implemented it in both styles, I found that each has limitations that wasnt clear to me originally.p  ul liWhen using the Command pattern, I can start accepting more input data by using a new buffer, while the earlier buffers are being processed by some Commands running in separate work threads. I cant seem to do this with Decorator pattern.li liWhen using the Decorator pattern, the decorator can make any number of calls to its delegate and be able to combine the results into one chunk. It can also split data, by making one big request, cache it, and then returning pieces of it. When I use Command pattern with one input buffer and one output buffer, there cannot be any combination or splitting of results.li ul

Negative 5025 pWe are having some performance issues with our EF4 MVC solution.

Negative 5025 pAssume I have a javascript function codecreateMyElementcode which returns a node that can be inserted into an HTML document.p  pIn order to function properly, the code of the node created by codecreateMyElementcode has to listen for events on the global codedocumentcode at least as soon as it is inserted in the document.p  pMy first attempt was to add codeDOMNodeInsertedIntoDocumentcode and codeDOMNodeRemovedFromDocumentcode listeners to the node at creation time that add and remove the needed listener on codedocumentcode in turn.p  pHowever, the mutation events are deprecated by now and dont seem to work reliably across browsers, so I am looking for a better solution.p  pAdding the listener for events at codedocumentcode at the creation time of the node would work. However, this doesnt seem to be a good solution as it would create memory and performance leaks Even after the node was being removed from the document again and not needed anymore, the listener and its references to the node on the codedocumentcode would still persist.p

Negative 5025 pI am working on a casual game with some improvement over time, much like TinyTower.p  pBut the biggest flaw in TinyTower and all respect, its a cute game is that cheating is too easy. The game relies on the device time, so when it says that this is done in eight hours you just set your clock eight hours ahead, get the thing, and then turn it back.p  pNow, I need to make sure that this isnt a way people can win in my game. I had one idea that i could crossreference the system time with the server time, but I cant rely on the connection being open, since offline play is an option.p  pI could also set up a sensor indicating if the OS time suddently was before lastplayedtime, you would earn an invisible cheatsuspicion counter. Three of these, and the game would reset, and mark you as a cheater.p  pThe final option was to simply not care, let cheaters be cheaters. But if I am to have a competative element, with hoghscores and such, i really need this to work.p  pSo... The question is this Does anyone know a safe reliable way of detecting how much time has passed since last time a user last had the app openp

Once the computation is completed, the same thread can be reused to start another computation on either the same or a different hardware depending on availability.

How many layers of quoting are there, really I cant seem to find the magic number of backslashes to get the goshdang thing to do what Im asking it to, even for the simplest regular expressions like code.code. Right now, the given customization produces  nothing. It makes no change from emacs default behavior. p  pBetter yet, where on earth is this documented Its a little difficult to Google for, but Ive been trying quite a few things there as well as in the official documentation and the Emacs wiki. Where is an authoritative source for how many dang backslashes one needs to make a regular expression in customizemode actually work  or at the very least, to fail with some kind of warning instead of failing silentlyp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong As so often happens with questions asked in anger, I was asking the wrong question. Fortunately the answers below, led me to the answer to the question that I needed, which was about quoting rules. Im going to try to write down what I learned here, because I find the documentation and Googleable resources to be maddeningly obscure about this. So here are the quoting rules I found by trial and error, and I hope that they help someone else, inspire correction, or both.p  pWhen an emacs customizemode buffer asks you for a Regexp matching filename, it is being, as emacs often is, both terse and idiosyncratic how often a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRichardStallman relnofollowthe creators personalitya is imparted to the creation.  It means, for one thing, a regexp that will be compared to the emwhole pathem of the file in search of a match, not just to the name of the file itself as you might assume from the term filename. This is the same sense of filename used in emacs codebufferfilenamecode function, for example. p  pFurther, although if you put codefoocode in the field, youll see codefoocode with doublequotes written to the actual file, thats not enough quoting and not the right quoting. You need to quote your regexp with the quoting style that, as far as I can tell, only emacs uses the codebacktickfoosinglequotecodescheme. And then you need to emescape that,em making it codex60backslashbacktickfoobackslashsinglequotecode and if you think thats a headache to input in Markdown, its more so in emacs. p  pOn top of this, emacs appears to have a rule that the code.code regexp special character does not match a codecode at the beginning of filenames, so, as was happening to me above, the classic code.code pattern will appear to match nothing to match all files, you actually need the regexp code.code, which then you stuff into the quote format of customizemode to produce codex60.code, after which customize paints emanotherem layer of escaping onto it and writes it to the customization file. p  pThe final result for one of my efforts  a setting such that autosave files dont gunk up the directory youre working in, but instead all live in one placep  pre classlangel prettyprintoverridecodecustomset variables   autosavefilenametransforms quote      [][][] .emacs.dautobackups2 t     .. .emacs.dautobackups1 t  codepre  pBackslashes in elisp are a far greater threat to your sanity than parentheses. p  hr  pstrongEDIT 2strong Time for me to be wrong again. I finally found the relevant documentation through reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7572411beginningandendofthestringinemacsregexpsanother Stack Overflow questiona, of course a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsemacsmanualhtmlnodeelispRegexpBackslash.htmlRegexpBackslash relnofollowRegexp Backslash Constructsa. The crucial point of confusion for me the backtick and single quote are emnotem quoting in this context theyre the equivalent of perls codecode and codecode special characters. The backslashbacktick construct matches an empty string anchored at the beginning of the string being checked for a match, and the backslashsinglequote construct matches the empty string at the end of the stringunderconsideration. And by string under consideration, I mean buffer, which just happens to contain only a file path in this case, but you need to match the whole dang thing if you want a match at all, since this is elisps global regexp behavior.p  pSwear to god, its like dealing with an alien civilization. p  hr  pstrongEDIT 3strong In order to avoid confusing future readers  p  ul licodecode is the emacs regex for the beginning of the buffer. cf a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgperlre.htmlAssertions relnofollowPerls codeAcodeali licodecode is the emacs regex for the end of the buffer. cf Perls codeZcodeli licodecode is the commonidiom regex for the beginning of the line. It can be used in emacs.li licodecode is the commonidiom regex for the end of the line. It can be used in emacs.li ul  pBecause regex searches across multiline bodies of text are more common in emacs than elsewhere e.g. codeMx occurcode, the backtick and singlequote special characters are used in emacs, and as best as I can tell, theyre used in the context of customizemode because if you are considering generic unknown input to a customizemode field, it could contain newlines, and therefore you want to use the beginningofbuffer and endofbuffer special characters because the beginning and end of the eminputem are not guaranteed to be the beginning and end of a emline.emp  pI am not sure whether to regret hijacking my own Stack Overflow question and essentially turning it into a blog post.p

Negative 5025 pIm having a little bit of difficulty with my insert method for this homework assignment. I have most of it done, but for some reason whenever my program is supposed to insert a node as a right child on the left side of the tree it just inserts it as a left child.p  pI kind of do my comparison in a weird way signs should be reversed for a lot of them, but it worked like that for some reason so please bear with me if you have difficulty in reading it. p  pI know that this is a horrible way to implement a binary search tree, and I would never ever do it in the real world, but its homework and thus  I have no choice.p  pAny and all help is appreciated, as always. Thank you p  pEdit I know where the problem is now. Its within the searchFor method. Instead of the nodes rightful parent, it makes the parent the root of the tree in this case the parent of the node is always cup. p  pnow that thats out of the way, can anyone offer up a solutionp  pEdit2 Took some of the extra stuff out that I dont think is relevant to the problem. Im pretty sure Ive narrowed it down to the searchFor method. Whenever I call to return the parent of the current node, it will return the root of the tree cup. I think thats why Im having my problems, since it inserts based on that. p  pThanks for all the help so far, I really appreciate it. p  precodepublic class BinarySearchTree implements Comparator

Negative 5025 pActually I want to return a generic list of certain types bases on a typed dataset. I know the type in my method, so I can use some kind of generic code to call to do the translation.p  pSo currently my methods return typed datasets, but they should return generic lists. I am thinking about using Automapper, but the time because of upcoming holidays lacks to create some prototypes. So I would really like to read about your experiences.p  pAny other suggestions on how to realize my goal are very welcome. This way I might learn of an even better way to complete my task.p

JAXWS out of the box uses uses the JAXB to marshalunmarshaler the web service payloads.p  pI also have a requirement to audit all request and response payloads.p  pI want a compact and concise marshaled representation of the payload for the audit as a irrelevant side note  I am auditing using a java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue and some consumer threads to put batches of audit data in the audit datasource.p  pI have binary contentmtom included on some web service response payloads but I DO NOT want to marshal audit these because the serialized base64 would be too large.p  pSo my need is to create a marshaller exclusively for auditng that in all cases will scrub binary content but then NOT scrub for the prime purpose of marshalling web service response payloads.  I do XSD to Java xjc.  I need to use the same XSDJAXB namespace for both contextsmarshallers.p  pJava type converterp  precodeltjxbjavaType name         parseMethodcom.xxx.xxx.ws.converter.XXXLongConverter.parseXXXLong              printMethodcom.xxx.xxx.ws.converter.XXXLongConverter.printXXXLong gt codepre  pis will not work because 1.

I cant be guaranteed the class name that JAXB will decide to create in order to unregister it.p  pI created my own XMLAdapter and used the annox jaxb plugin but that didnt really work for the same reasons the above didnt work.p  pUpdate I now tried manually and reflectively walking through payloadto be audited prior to marshalling to scrub the binary data but that got to be too much pain for what it was worth. p  pI should also mention that for brevity of the audit I am using jersey a hrefhttpjersey.java.net relnofollowJSON serialization supporting JAXBa but I dont think that takes away or adds to my base problemp  pHow can I scrub data in one marshallerunmarshaller but not another but both whose origin is the same JAXB contextp  pUPDATE  strikeNever figured out an elegate way to do this.  Not really possible at this point with the frameworks as they are. strike UPDATE Not true. Extending AttachmentMarshaller I like this a lot and will use it or creating a needaware XmlAdapter would work for the audit specific marshaller as Blaise answers below.  p  pUPDATE  If I may take this a step further to round out my use case...I mentioned above that for brevity of the audit Id like to do Json Serialization of the a hrefhttpjersey.java.netnonavapidocslatestjerseycomsunjerseyapijsonJSONJAXBContext.html relnofollowJSONJAXBContexta using jersey apis, specifically using the JSONMarshaller but the interface does not define setAdapter and setAttachmentMarshaller.

I will grudgingly cast to impl so I can set my custom attachment marshaller.p

Negative 5025 pIm trying to combine the use of a Sass variable with media queries as followsp  precodebasewidth1160px  media screen and maxwidth 1170px basewidth 960px media screen and minwidth 1171px basewidth 1160px codepre  pcodebasewidthcode is then defined at various points in the stylesheet width percentagebased measurements to produce fluid layouts.p  pWhen I do this, the variable seems to be recognized properly but the conditions for the media query are not.  For example, the above code produces an 1160px layout regardless of screen width.  If I flipflop the media statements like sop  precodemedia screen and minwidth 1171px basewidth 1160px media screen and maxwidth 1170px basewidth 960px codepre  pIt produces a 960px layout, again regardless of screen width.

Negative 5025 pI need to avoid overlapping date ranges in my database.

I have only one application writing to the database.  A few others are reading from it, where read performance is critical.  The application that does the writing is threaded  its a web app  and is in a cluster.p  pSo, I was thinking it may be easiest to just ensure that only 1 process was writing at a time.  Is this the right approach  If so, should I just have a single threaded app that listens to some request queue and processes these requests in the order that it receives them  I have all of these requests in a database anyway and was just thinking of using the createdat date and status to process them.p

However, when I send the archive to my colleague, he cant test it he says it builds but does not attempt to install or run on the device, only complaining valid signing identity not found.p  pClearly I am not understanding something in the process about how development profiles work. There must surely be some way to produce a project that can be compiled by anyone, and doesnt require my profile to be on the machine, or example projects wouldnt be able to compile And why should a project in sourceonly form even need a profile attached to itp  pAm I understanding correctly that 1 Ive somehow bundled my personal developer information into the sourceonly project, and this is stopping it from being built by another unconnected developer, and 2 that if so, it is actually possible to share projects in this way How would I go about separating the project from the profilep  pI am dimly aware that this is also the wrong way to share projects I am open to suggestions for changing that too, but still want to understand what Im doing wrong, and where Ive missed something that must be obvious in the provisioning process.p

Negative 5025 pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netKyomu5RbXJ1 relnofollowMy Codeap  pI have a div that when you hover over it shows different browsers and if they are supported, done in css. However, I also wanted to have them animate in with jquery, which I have working.p  pHowever, if you move the mouse to quickly over the hover area and then hover over it, that animation wont retrigger. You have to move the mouse quite far away, and then hover over it. The best way to recreate this problem I find is to put your mouse above it and quickly hover over it and out again a few times.p  pI suspect that the reason is that jquery still thinks the mouse is over, even though the css hides it and says its not. I also think having to move the mouse far away is time related rather than distance, but again not sure. Also Ive tried .mouseover, .hover, and .mouseenter, with .mouseenter seeming to behave the best.p  pIs this suspected behavior Its not exactly breaking, but I would like for this effect to work. If this is expected behavior, would possibly a css3 animation be able to copy the effect how I would wantp  pAlso as a side note, if you viewed the fiddle, any others browsers I should think of adding personal perspective ok, but more of if any browsers have sneakily gotten more popularp

Negative 5025 pI have an iPad app which uses an open source class MMGridView. Basically I perform a CoreData query, and then this class draws boxes on the screen in a grid pattern to represent the results.  The boxes include photos. Everything works fine, except that sometimes there is an unexplained time lag until the UI is drawn on the screen.  Sometimes the refresh is instant, sometimes it is over 20 seconds.  It appears very random in its behaviour.p  pIve managed to determine thatp  ul liDrawRect is being called every time.  li lithat the lag is not occurring in the DrawRect method.li liwhen I run the time profiler, from what I can tell, nothing is happening during this time lagli ul  pMy question is, what happens after DrawRect is called that I can try to look at to identify the problemp  pAbsolutely any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  p  pNote also that user interaction is able to cut the lag short.  rotating the iPad triggers redraw always makes the ui refresh immediately  pressing the button to redo the same query will generally refresh the screenp  pSo it really appears like there is just some random delay Im hitting, as opposed to any sort of processorwork load issue.  Problem is that programmatically, I cant tell if the UI has updated or not.  Otherwise I could just ask it to redraw again. p  pIm including the code from the DrawRect method just in case that sparks any ideas, but from what I can tell, this method completes before the lag occurs.p  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect   if self.dataSource ampamp self.numberOfRows gt 0 ampamp self.numberOfColumns gt 0      NSInteger noOfCols  self.numberOfColumns     NSInteger noOfRows  self.numberOfRows     NSUInteger cellsPerPage  noOfCols  noOfRows     NSLogrows  d, cols  d, noOfCols, noOfRows     CGRect gridBounds  self.scrollView.bounds     CGRect cellBounds  CGRectMake0, 0, gridBounds.size.width  floatnoOfCols,                                     gridBounds.size.height  floatnoOfRows      CGSize contentSize  CGSizeMakeself.numberOfPages  gridBounds.size.width, gridBounds.size.height     [self.scrollView setContentSizecontentSize]      for UIView v in self.scrollView.subviews          [v removeFromSuperview]           for NSInteger i  0 i lt [self.dataSource numberOfCellsInGridViewself] i          MMGridViewCell cell  [self.dataSource gridViewself cellAtIndexi]         [cell performSelectorselectorsetGridView withObjectself]         [cell performSelectorselectorsetIndex withObject[NSNumber numberWithInti]]          NSInteger page  intfloorfloati  floatcellsPerPage         NSInteger row   intfloorfloati  floatnoOfCols  page  noOfRows          CGPoint origin  CGPointMakepage  gridBounds.size.width  i  noOfCols  cellBounds.size.width,                                       row  cellBounds.size.height          CGRect f  CGRectMakeorigin.x, origin.y, cellBounds.size.width, cellBounds.size.height         cell.frame  CGRectInsetf, self.cellMargin, self.cellMargin          [self.scrollView addSubviewcell]        codepre

Negative 5025 pI believe this is a fundamental question regarding asp.nets way of manipulating database items. Basically the server side way of manipulating database items using ListView or similar is outdated due to the post back model is outdated compared to AJAX. Lets say you have forward and backward buttons on the gallery to update images from the database. You need to postback in order to update page. Clearly this could use an ajaxfied approach. I have been thinking about this long and hard and have observed most websites that uses ListView or GridView or whatever do not ajaxfy the process, probably due to the difficulty of this problem. For those that ajaxfy the page, they use the UpdatePanel, which is only pseudoajax. p  pI would like to know do other programmers have a FULLY ajaxfied way of updating a page of a photo gallery, retrieved from database by ListView As I said I have been thinking about this long and hard and I think there might be two approaches First, use ListView to first populate photo gallery. On pressing forward or backword button, use jQuerys ajax method to connect to an .ashx page and use .ashx page to retrieve data items and then use jQuery to update the photo gallery at the client side.p  pThe second way I forsee would be abandoning the ListView altogether and use a for loop in .ashx to populate gallery from the beginning. This approach unifies the initial data retrieval method and the postback data retrieval method, which could mean less code needed, since you do not need the aspx page at all.p  pMy question is, what is the realistic way to fully ajaxfy the page mentioned abovep

My approach is thisp  pcodeSELECT ID FROM statistics WHERE NOT EXISTSSELECT ID FROM statistics WHERE useragent NOT LIKE botcodep  pThis should select all rows from statistics which are not present in the query which searches for nonbots.

Negative 5025 pIm building a Rails application, and something Ill need to do regularly is load new data from an external source into the database. I want to build some tools to do this data load, but its the sort of task Ill want to run manually, ideally from the command line, rather than fully automate it or have an automatic background task. And Id like to use the model objects to do this, rather than directly dump data into the appropriate tables.p  pWhats the best way to do this in terms of the Rails project organization It would be perfect if someone could point me to an existing FOSS application that does this.

Negative 5025 pIm trying to add a menu item to show the main window.

That is of course useless and silly. p  pAnother menu item, FilePage Setup... is NOT grayed out in the same way on minimizeclose.

Negative 5025 pIm trying to develop a simple web based chat program in java. Im using spring, tomcat, hibernate, javascript, ajax, and jquery. Im new to all of these technologies. I asked a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13226994javatomcat6howtoautomaticallyrefreshpagewhenadataisaddedherea on SO. I got alot of answers  suggestions. One suggestion is to use WebServerSocket but the problem is I think tomcat6 does not support it. For some reasons I have to stick to tomcat6. I got suggestion to learn about ajax polling. Im reading it right now and as I understand it has some intervals to fetch another query. Is there a way that I can have my program fetch query if the server notices that a client uploaded  posted data to the server Another question is, does skype uses polling If polling has interval in fetching of data will it cause traffic to my server Please be patient in explaining to me because I believe there are alot of concepts that I misunderstood about polling. Please enlighten me. Im reading alot about polling, comet, jms and my brain is already very confused. I spent almost 8 hours and I can barely grasp the concepts. Please help and suggest where will I begin. Im such a novice. Thanks in advance.  p

Negative 5025 pTrying to keep questions and answers simpler, I will reduce my problem from 3d to 2d.p  pI have a 2d grid with XY cells in 2d space. It is defined simply by X, Y, bBoxMin2d and bBoxMax2d.p  pOn the GPU currently in a VBO, I have XY unsigned 8 bit integers, which define the brightness of the cells. So, for XY3, if the VBO contains 4, 7, 3, 2, 9, 4, 7, 2, 1, the grid should be rendered using patches of the following brightnessp  precode4 7 3 2 9 4 7 2 1 codepre  pI know I could create another VBO containing the worldposition of the center of each cell and use the geometry shader to create a patch to be passed on to the fragment shader.p  pHowever, I want to be more efficient and do without a second VBO. My thinking is that if every instance of the geometry shader had its own thread index similar to CUDA, it could create the cells patch using only that index, and bBoxMin2d and bBoxMax2d from e.g. a UBO. The fragment shader would then read the color from the VBO and Id be happy.p  pBut it seems there is no geometryshader threadindex. So, how can I solve my problemp  pPlease dont tell me to use another VBO with the positions  that would increase memory requirements from sizeofuint8t  1 byte per cell to at least sizeoffloat3  sizeofuint8t  13 bytes. And I have lots of cells p

Negative 5025 pIm a IT student in the university, been programming in Visual Basic for a great time. Learnt Java here and C by myselfreally analog to Java.

Starting from small things like a Sound Sequencer. I already have some flow diagrams made.p  pI want to start coding it as soon as possible, but Java is an interpreted language as SuperCollider and Python, making it slow for processing. Visual Basic is not an option, I loved starting with it, but I dont like it anymore. I dont know if I should use C, I, as a Linux lover, dont want to marry with Windows just because I need to use Visual Studio. I know there is Mono.p  pWhat is a good language for me Could it be somethingp  ol liFast processing, non interpreted if its possibleli liAble to make my software crossplatform.

Negative 5025 pIm designing a database to store documents. Some of these documents clock in at just over 64kb and none would be larger than 128kb. It appears that my only recourse is to specify my texttype as codeMEDIUMTEXTcode which has a maximum size of 16MB. That just seems like overkill for what I am doing especially since Im storing probably a hundred documents a day. I guess the question I have is whether or not Im going to experience a performance hit since MEDIUMTEXT is so much bigger than TEXT. I dont know much about the MySQL internals to know if theres some weird allotment issue on disk or memory that will come back to bite me. Of course we could just do it all in something modern like MongoDB but I cant get a sign off on that. br In case someone else is grappling with this in the future, I thought Id note the text types in MySQL and their maximum sizes for reference.p  precodeTINYTEXT 256 bytes TEXT 65,535 bytes 64kb MEDIUMTEXT 16,777,215 bytes 16MB LONGTEXT 4,294,967,295 bytes 4GB codepre  pAny advice anyone has would be appreciated.

But I forgot to p  pcodechange int id getResources.getIdentifiercom.musicbynumbers.pianoscalesfulldrawable  gotScale, null, nullcodep  pAll the code was good. Thanks a lot for your help.p  pOk, this is just some beckground info before I get into the exact problem   Im using eclipse. I published my first app a piano scales app on the play store a few weeks ago with licencing. Two days ago I realised that the licencing prevented some users who paid for the app from using it. I commented out the licencing and went to update but my keystore was corrupted. So I removed the app from the store and changed the package name. The app is a menu that brings you to a display Activity where the selected image is displayed. While I was testing the app again I found that only the default android image is displayed. I dont think I changed any of the code in the submenu or the display activities since it was working, But Ill put them up anyway. BTW this is my first app and the app is sechedualed to be released tomorrow accompanying a book, so this is some real 11th hour situation for me.p  pThis is one of several submenus that leads to the

Negative 5025 pConsider me a n00b but I have searched my specific query here and I havent found the answer yet. My problem is as follows. Consider the following simplified csv file rsplit.csv which represents my datasetp  precodeid,v1,v2,v3,v4,str 1,2.4,2.4,345.5,234.2,gbbc 2,4.5,2.56,7.45,34.6,ebird 3,3.4,5.6,4.45,6.3,ebirdcan codepre  pThe first row contains the header names. You can see that the column str contains 3 different string values i.e. codegbbc, ebird, ebirdcancode. My objective is emto split this big dataset into 2 datasetsem. The first one will only contain all the str values  codegbbccode and the second one will contain all the str values of codeebirdcode and codeebirdcancode renamed as codeallebirdcode.p  pI can split the dataset into 3 distinct datasets by using the following commandp  precodesplittedltsplitrsplit,rsplitstr codepre  pHowever, I cannot figure out how to use 2 distinct values of the str column and combine them into the third. Can someone help me out pleasep  pThanks.p
Negative 5025 pI have a long, variable list of codeMarkercodes and codePolylinecodes Im getting from my server. In some conditions, the codeMarkercodes have to change their icons, and the codePolylinecodes have to change their colors.p  pMy objects have ids, so I should be able to know which polyline  marker I have to update. However, Markers and Polylines do not have codesetIdcode or codegetIdcode methods, and they are updated and added dynamically when the server requests it.p  pIve thought of using a codeHashMapltInteger, Markergtcode and a codeHashMapltInteger, Polylinegtcode in order to know which items I should remove and then add. Ive thought of thisp  ul liI recieve an item. I get its id.li liI query the correct codeHashMapcode for an item with the same Id.li liIf the HashMap does not return null, I call codeMarker.removecode or codePolyline.removecode, and then I remove the item from the codeHashMapcodeli liNow codehashMap.getidcode should return null no matter what, so I draw the codePolylinecode  codeMarkercode in the codeGoogleMapcode add the item to the codeHashMapcode.li ul  pBut before I start implementing this, I would like to know if theres any way of doing this that does not involve using giant codeHashMapcodes.p  pIs there any alternative way of achieving this behavior without using codeHashMapcodes, codeSparseArraycodes or something similarp
Negative 5025 pThis is a Phonegap android app that uses HTML5 canvas preferably with fabricjs. One of the required functionality is that it can load image from gallerytake picture from camera and save the image after some preset edits. The input imageimage taken from camera may be different in size depending on the device but the output image needs to be of fixed size 900x450 in this case always. The app is supposed to support devices with both smaller and bigger screens. I can load the image to the canvas of preset size and export data url after edits. But how do I get around using it on a smaller screen I can display a smaller scaled down canvas and do manipulations there and do the actual stuff on a hidden canvas of the required size, but that would be very messy. Is there a better approach to thisp

Negative 5025 pFirst, I create an instance of CKEditor named richEditor in a webPage.

Negative 5025 pI have a C class that defines a few aliases with the emusingem keyword for some public properties.

Otherwise I would just use the underlying type without the alias.p

Negative 5025 pWe are using the Box Widget in our Salesforce client and this allows our users to easily upload files to Box system.  However, we also need to upload files that may have been added by users as attachments to various objects.  p  pEvery example Ive seen so far shows a Rest service sending a form POST where the intended file was received from within the browser using  tags.  However, the apex method wasnt triggered by a FormPost. p  pCertainly we can retrieve the Attachment object, and I know how to create a Rest Service to call Boxs API, but I dont know how to simulate a file upload when we only have apex Blobs to send.p
Negative 5025 pI want to build an app that has sherlock action bar and a search view inside it. However, i want this searchview to have autocomplete feature like what autocompleteTextView has. Is there any straight forward implementation to do that using searchview alone or should i use autocompleteTextView inside action bar to do this I found several posts out there, but none of them are helping me. Those posts talk only about creating a autocompleteTextView , but i want search view to have this functionality. Any idea how can it be donep

Negative 5025 pIm making a DAW in Java, actually its more basic than that, I modelled it after an old Tascam 4Track recorder I once owned. Im trying to monitor audio while recording with as little latency delay between the two as possible. If I write the audio bytes in the same thread Im reading them in theres a significant amount of latency if you want to see the code I have Ill post it but it seemed irrelevant since I think it needs to be rewritten. What I had been thinking about doing is using a producer, consumer thread and a queue to store chunks of bytes in between. so my producer thread would read bytes from a codeTargetDataLinecode and store them in a queue, probably using a method that returns the number of bytes read so I can check for the EOF in my while loop. And create a concurrent thread that takes the chunks of bytes stored in the queue when they are bytes to be written and writes them to a codeSourceDataLinecode. My thought is two threads running simultaneously will be able to write the bytes almost at the same time theyre read, or at least be better than what I have now but I want to know how other people have solved this problem.p  pAlso I would need to make sure my consumer thread waits if there are no bytes in the queue and is notified when bytes are added to start writing bytes again, if some one would post an example of the proper way to synchronize the two threads I would appreciate it. I know they have to be in synchronized code blocks, should I use multiple locks Im not asking for an example specific to audio just a general example that adds something to a collection then removes it, any help is appreciated. Thanks.p

Or the existing ones Mobile What about the browsers who do not use Webkitp  pemPS I have not tried either of the librariesemp
Negative 5025 pI have a large number of reasonably sizable XML files that Id like to import into a MySQL table. Im running Centos 6.3 and MySQL 5.6, I had initially tried 5.5 but ran into issues and later found out about a bug in 5.5 regarding empty XML tags so under the impression that this had been resolved in 5.6 I went for that. p  pThe XML files themselves contains a number elements that I have no interest in so the table that the data is being inserted into contains quite a lot fewer fields than there are elements in the XML file but as far as I know this shouldnt be an issue. All of the field name correspond to element names in the XML files.p  pI have this tablep  precode    CREATE TABLE products          sku BIGINT20 UNSIGNED NOT NULL,         productId BIGINT20 UNSIGNED NOT NULL,         name VARCHAR250 NULL,         type VARCHAR250 NULL,         format VARCHAR250 NULL,         albumTitle VARCHAR250 NULL,         artistName VARCHAR250 NULL,         upc BIGINT15 UNSIGNED NULL,         shortDescription TEXT NULL,         image VARCHAR100 NULL,         INDEX Index 1 productId,         INDEX Index 2 name,         INDEX Index 3 type,         INDEX Index 4 format      codepre  pThe XML is in the formatp  blockquote precode   ltproductsgt        ltproductgt            ...        ltproductgt        ...    ltproductsgt codepre blockquote  pand Im using this to insert the datap  precodeLOAD XML LOCAL INFILE filename.xml INTO TABLE products ROWS IDENTIFIED BY ltproductgt codepre  pThe correct number of rows are being inserted but all fields in the database contain nothing or NULL. This appears to be the same issue I was seeing with 5.5 whereby XML containing empty tags e.g. codeltsku gtcode as opposed to codeltskugtltskugtcode are not handled and cause this sort of result.p  pI suppose my question is is there anything I can do to prevent this behavior. Am I doing this correctlyp  pI had thought about trying to find and replace all empty tag but this is beyond my knowledge in Linux so maybe is thats an option and someone can suggest a way of achieving it that would be a great help, but any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 5025 pIm working on a Symfony2 project and am trying to figure out how to pass parameters from the route configuration to the controller.  I know I can configure default values in the route configuration, and retrieve the values in the controller using the appropriate var name in the function declaration, but that isnt exactly what I want.p  pMy use case is the following.  I have a standard method in my controller that I want to access from 2 or 3 different routes.  Depending on which route is being called, I want to configure the method differently.  I can accomplish this in a few waysp  ol liIn my controller, check the route name using thiscontainergetrequestgetroute, but that is ugly, and then I am hardcoded to the route name.  Moves configuration to the controller, which should just be logic  not configuration.li liCreate a base controller class, and subclass each method for my different routes.  Each subclassed method would then have the necessary configuration within the method.  Cleaner soln than 1, but still heavy in the sense of having multiple classes for a simple need and still pushes configuration data into the business logic.li liPut configuration data into the route configuration.  In the controller, access the configuration data as required.  Ideal solution, but dont know how.li ol  pI can use the route default array to specify my arguments, but then must make sure to use a regex to ensure that the params are not overridden at the URL level security risk.  This is functional, but still kinda cludgy and not a pretty hack.p  pI presume that there must a better way to do this, but I cant seem to figure it out.  Is there a way to access the routing object from the controller, and access the different configuration parametersp

Negative 5025 pIn my JavaScript application, I have several kinds of objects, including codeQuerycode, codeDocumentcode and codePostingcode . A Document contains a bunch of metadata about a document title, abstract, etc. a Posting represents some Document retrieved by some Query at some rank. The same Document may be retrieved by more than one Query, and thus may have more than one Posting associated with it.p  pThe application has two relevant views one that displays all Postings for a given Query, and one that displays all Documents. Since the user can interact with the two views in much the same way, I decided to use prototype inheritance by making a Document instance the prototype of one or more Posting instances. That way, the Posting inherits all of the metadata from the Document, and just adds its own Query reference and rank value. Works like a charm.p  pIn addition to data Query, rank a posting carries some behavior as well. I wanted to factor out this behavior so that I dont have thousands of identical methods being created. In the case of Document, I simply moved all my functions to codeDocument.prototypecode. But in the case of Postings, I cannot do that, because each Posting has a different prototype its respective Document. While I could put some of the methods used by Posting into codeDocument.prototypecode and get at them that way, some of the methods are polymorphic and need to be implemented differently for Document and Posting. p  pMy question is this if I am using prototype inheritance in Posting to carry emdataem, can I somehow also factor out embehaviorem so that I reuse the same method function instances for all my Posting instances instead of creating a new batch of methods every time I create a new Postingp  precodefunction Documentid, title      this.id  id     this.title  title    Here prototype is used to factor out behavior Document.prototype.document  function  return this  Document.prototype.toString  function  return Document [  this.id  ]   this.title      function Postingquery, rank      this.query  query     this.rank  rank       Can I move these two definitions out of the Posting instance to avoid      creating multiple copies of these functions as I construct 1000s of Postings     this.document  function  return Object.getPrototypeOfthis      this.toString  function  return this.document.toString   at rank   this.rank    function createPostingquery, document, rank       here prototype is used to share data     Posting.prototype  document     var posting  new Postingquery, rank     return posting  codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI made a mistake in the code example above the correct way to do inheritance as pointed out in comments below is to set the prototype first codePosting.prototype  documentcode I think the rest of my question is still valid p

Negative 5025 pIts a very specific problem I havep  pIm working on a textbased RPG, where the main work is to implement an editor, that gives the possibility to add NPCs, Items and place them on the map ... without any knowledge about programming.p  pAll of these things work fine with doing some SQL queries and the whole thing already works. Now Im working on quest editing. My basic concept is, that every time the player enters a command, a database entry for the specific string is queried, thats linked to a set of conditions and actions, which have unique IDs. Those are queried in the java code, where a specific condition e.g. that the players money equals 100 has a part of code that returns the result. This means, that hundreds or more IFs have to be passed, each time a command is entered  same with the actions according to the command. Im not even sure if that is the right way If anyone has a propose to this, feel free to post.p  pThe point is now, that quests basically consist of quest stages, which also have conditions to be enabled and actions, performed when enabled. That means, that also with each entered command, all of these queries have to take place. I thought about using some kind of trigger, but I dont have a good idea how to implement it, because I dont really want to edit java code out of this editor. I also considered using prolog, but also in that case Id have to add triggers into java code I guess.p  pI know that this is a little bit hard to handle in a forum like this, but if anyone has a suggestion, Id be really glad.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs suggested in a comment, Id like to shorten the whole thing If any command out of houndres or thousands could trigger one particular questquest stage out of thousands and these triggers should be set with an editor, whats a proper way to implement thatp

Replicate Modelh2  pObviously I could properly separate all data entries up into the bits that make up a document instead of storing Peter Pan as one big document, I could fragment it out, but that would leave me with a situation where I could possibly get multiple hits on the same actual objects as I see it... It would also be allot of fields.p  h22. Multiple Documentsh2  pAlternatively I could store one document pr. restriction with just the data a for what a single caveat may give the rights to, again as far as I can tell this gives multiple hits and it also gives allot of redundant data.p  h23. Filtering by DataBase roundtriph2  pLastly but not least I could perform the search ignoring caveats, and then rather than displaying the results directly from Lucene, I could let our DataAccess tier do the caveat filtering for me, that would add a roundtrip to the database earlier than needed though.p  pAlthough the roundtrip to the database might be the least of my concern here. There is also the fact. that Lucene would return hits that might not actually be hits when it comes to the search term, as the value generating that hit might not be visible to that user.p  pThis also means the number of results might be off.p  pAll in all, it wouldnt just be an extra database roundtrip, we would have to also redo the filtering after that result had been pulled up.p  hr  pI would hear if I could reach someone with more Lucene experience than my self to give some input if possible.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5025 pIm code reviewing a WCF service. In the header of each message we inject data that the service is going to use later to build a connection string to a DB. Thats because the service is going to be used by a number of different sites, each with its own DB that the service has to query.  We use wcf extensibility. We have a custom MessageInspector that, after receiving the request, extracts the data from the message header, creates a context that implements IExtension and adds it to OperationContext.Current.Extensions. Before sending the reply the custom context is removed from the Extencions collection.p  pThis is a fairly common pattern, as discussed herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1895732wheretostoredataforcurrentwcfcallisthreadstaticsafeWhere to store data for current WCF call Is ThreadStatic safeap  pand herep  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS319cac6666e84dfe9a82dfd289c9df1fwcfdoesnthavesessionstoragesowhereshouldonestorecallspecificdataforumwcfhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS319cac6666e84dfe9a82dfd289c9df1fwcfdoesnthavesessionstoragesowhereshouldonestorecallspecificdataforumwcfap  pThis all works fine as long as the service receives a request, processes it, sends the reply and receives the next request. But what if the service receives a request and before being able to reply it gets a second request I built a small console application to test it. I send 2 messages from 2 different threads, I made the wcf service wait for 2 seconds, to ensure the second request comes in before the first one is completed and this is what I getp  pSite Id  test1450  Session uuid2caf47cf7d464d729275d9c037fa0e70id2  Thread Id 6p  pSite Id  test1450  Session uuid2caf47cf7d464d729275d9c037fa0e70id3  Thread Id 22 p  pIt looks like wcf creates 2 sessions executing on 2 different threads, but Site Id is the same.

YSlow command line does not seem to recognize the entries in my .HAR files so there are no offenders.

Negative 5025 pWe are using JSF with Primefaces on a IBM Websphere 8. My problem is, that if I have more Conversations in JSF, the ViewState expires.

Negative 5025 pI have 32 machine threads and one codeConcurrentHashMapltKey,Valuegt mapcode, which contains a lot of keys. codeKeycode has defined a public method codevisitcode. I want to codevisitcode every element of map exactly once using the processing power I have available and possibly some sort of thread pooling.p  pThings I could tryp  ul liI could use the method codemap.keyscode. The resulting codeEnumerationltKeygtcode could be iterated over using codenextElementcode, but since a call to codekey.visitcode is very brief I wont manage to keep threads busy. The Enumeration is inherently singlethreaded.li liI could use a synchronised codeHashSetltKeygtcode instead, invoke a method codetoArraycode and split the work on the array into all 32 threads. I seriously doubt in this solution, since the method codetoArraycode will likely be a singlethread bottleneck.li liI could try to inherit from codeConcurrentHashMapcode, get my hands on the instances of its inner codeSegmentltK,Vgtcode, try to group them into 32 groups and work on each group separately. This sounds like a hardcore approach though.li lior similar magic with codeEnumerationltKeygtcode.li ul  pIdeallyp  ul liIdeally a codeConcurrentHashMapltKey, Valuegtcode would define a method codekeysEnumeratorint approximatePositioncode, which could drop me an enumerator missing approximately first 132 elements, i.e. codemap.keysEnumeratormap.size32codeli ul  pAm I missing anything obvious Has anybody run into similar problem beforep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve had a go at profiling to see whether this problem is actually going to affect the performance in practice. As I dont have access to the cluster at the moment I used my laptop and tried to extrapolate the results to a bigger dataset. On my machine I can create a 2 million keys ConcurrentHashMap and it takes about 1 second to iterate over it invoking the codevisitcode method on every key. The program is supposed to scale to 85 million keys and over. The clusters processor is slightly faster, but it still should take about 40 seconds to iterate over entire map. Now a few words about the logic flow of the program. The logic presented is sequential, i.e. it is not allowed for any thread to proceed to the next step until all the threads in the previous step are finishedp  ol  liCreate the hash map, create the keys and populate the hash map liIterate over entire hash map visiting all the keys. liDo some data shuffling which is parallel insertions and deletions. liRepeat step 2 and 3 a few hundred times. ol  pThat logic flow means that a 40 second iteration is going to be repeated a few hundred times, say 100. Which gives us stronga bit over an hourstrong spent just in visiting the nodes. With a set of 32 parallel iterators it could go down to just a few minutes, which is a significant performance improvement.p  pNow a few words on how codeConcurrentHashMapcode works Or how I believe it works. Every codeConcurrentHashMapcode consists of segments by default 16. Every write to a hash map is synchronised on a relevant segment. So say were trying to write two new keys k1 and k2 to the hash map and that they would be resolved to belong to the same segment, say s1. If they are attempted to be written simultaneously, one of them is going to acquire the lock first and be added earlier then the other. What is the chance of two elements to be resolved to belong to the same segment In case we have got a good hash function and 16 segements it is 116.p  pI belive that codeConcurrentHashMapcode should have a method codeconcurrentKeyscode, which would return an array of Enumerations, one per each segment. I have got a few ideas how to add it to codeConcurrentHashMapcode through inheritance and Ill let you know if I succeed. As for now the solution seems to be to create an array of ConcurrentHashMaps and prehashing every key to resolve to one member of such array. Ill share that code as well, once its ready.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThis is the same problem in a different languagep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13233274paralleliteratorsParallel Iteratorsap

The webviews stop loading any content, i.e. they either show blank or the content that was shown before.p  pThe test environment is p  pPlatform Google Nexus S  Android 4.1.2 not only this platform, a lot of other platforms, even the emulators are affectedp  pAds SDK 6.4.1 we also tested Ads SDK 4.1.1 which has the same problemp  pThe way to reproduce this issue isp  ol lipconstruct an android project using the following manifest, main.xml layout and helloAndroid.java, and also Ads SDK 6.4.1 or lower versionpli liprun the HelloAndroid project in the above platform, or other platforms even emulators which may also be affectedpli lipAfter the app starts, it shows OnCreate function called. in the webview, and also the time when the content is loaded. Meanwhile, ads show on the top of the screenpli lipNow click the Start Calculating Thread button, at the same time, rotate screen to change its orientation, then immediately change orientation again, etc... meanwhile, continuously click the Start Calculating Thread button immediately after last calculating task finishes. Repeat these actions for a few times, then you will notice that the webview does not reload. Its text is always Background calculating thread done whether you rotate screen or not. Its text could also be Configuration changed whether you click the Start Calculating Thread button or not. The time shown in the webview is not updated either. The ads are not shown.pli ol  pFrom the log file, we can see a lot of ads errors likep  p1117 115111.254 IAds7411 AdLoader timed out after 60000ms while getting the URL.p  p1117 115111.254 IAds7411 onFailedToReceiveAdA network error occurred.p  pWe also get an exception, but this exception appears after the above error came out.p  p1117 115314.597 WAds7411 An error occurred while loading data in AdWebViewp  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411 The following was caught and handledp  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411 java.lang.NullPointerExceptionp  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at android.webkit.WebViewClassic.loadDataWithBaseURLWebViewClassic.java2564p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at android.webkit.WebView.loadDataWithBaseURLWebView.java842p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at com.google.ads.internal.AdWebView.loadDataWithBaseURLSourceFile229p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at com.google.ads.internal.cc.runSourceFile164p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java615p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java92p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4745p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Methodp  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java786p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java553p  p1117 115314.609 IAds7411    at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Methodp  pWe believe this issue is caused by AdView not by webView or the thread programming based on the following observationsp  ol lipWe have found that, even if we place the webView in another activity, i.e. the multithread activity only includes a button and adView, this problem still comes out after the above reproducing steps. And after the problem comes we move the other activity which includes the webView, it still stops loading anything. In other words, it is not the webView who triggers the problem.pli lipThe calculating thread is very simple, no UI operation is included in it. Start and stop loading ads are always done in the main thread.pli ol  pThe codes are quite simple.

Negative 5025 pIm working on an app that allows the user to create a little comic from a photo. Ive implemented codeCoreDatacode so the user can save and reedit their comic. Ive created two entities codeComicInfocode and codeComicDetailscode which have a relationship with one another I did it this way from reading the Ray Wenderlich tutorial. So when the user saves a comic, I make a new codeComicInfocode codeNSManagedObjectcode, store the name and thumbnail in it, then I create a codeComicDetailscode codeNSManagedObjectcode, store various attributes in that, and I store the codeComicDetailscode in the codeComicInfocode and save.  p  pIve created a UITableView that displays the thumbnails and names from all the ComicInfo objects to allow the user to select one so they can edit the comic. p  pWhat Im wondering is, why did I separate this into two entities instead of just doing them in one Im assuming that when I load all of the codeComicInfoscode from codeCoreDatacode, that the codeComicDetailscode will also be loaded into memory, or am I wrong about that In a perfect world, Id like it so only the codeComicInfoscode are loaded when the codeUITableViewcode is launched, then when the user selects one of the rows, the associated codeComicDetailscode will then be loaded into memory. Is that not whats happening herep

Negative 5025 pIm working on making an object to wrap controls around instances of html5 audio elements. For testing, Ive made an object like this simplified for readability.. p  precodefunction AudioObjectaudio      var innerAudio  audio      this.Play  function           innerAudio.play       codepre  pAnd I have an array holding instances of this AudioObject.p  precodevar AudioObjects  [] codepre  pThen, when creating new AudioObjects, I add them to the array. I have a function that plays the AudioObjects with delays so they play in sequence. Something like thisp  precodevar audioObj  new AudioObjectaudio AudioObjects.pushaudioObj .... .... var delay  0 .eachAudioObjects, functioniterator, obj      setTimeoutobj.Play, delay     delay  delay  3000  codepre  pWhen there is just one audio file, it plays correctly, but once I add more AudioObjects, each one in the array has their innerAudio variable set to the latest created Audio element. I can play each one individually from the html. Ive debugged on creation and I can see its setting the right audio, but after being pushed to the array, the objects in the array all get switched to the latest innerAudio.p  pAm I not instantiating my objects correctly Ive made a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netA3AGc relnofollowthis jsfiddlea to experiment with alerting text, and it doesnt seem to have the issues Im experiencing.p  pUpdate I think I found my issue. This is how I thought you write a public and a private function inside of an object.p  precodefunction Thingtest      var thingTest  test       Public function     this.PublicTest  function           setTimeoutTest, 1000            Private function     PrivateTest  function          alertthingTest       codepre  pThis is essentially how my code was structured, but the private function has a different scope than the public one. I doublechecked my array, and it was actually saving the right audioObject with the correct audio source, but when running the function that calls the private function, it calls the wrong audio file.p  pIve updated a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netA3AGc relnofollowthe jsfiddlea to show whats happening. I thought it would alert test1 then test2 but it alerts test2 twice.p  pUpdate 2 For the record, changing the private function to this fixed the problemp  precodefunction Play     ltltlt Thats all I had to change     innerAudio.play  codepre

Negative 5025 pI am looking to make an app which uses the SSH2 protocol. It will be connecting to an application running on a computer which is emnotem an SSH server. Currently Ive looked at a hrefhttpsgithub.comx2onlibssh2foriOS relnofollowlibssh2foriOSa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comLejdborgNMSSH relnofollowNMSSHa, however both of these seem to require a server with a shell running on the other end. p  pI only need the protocol. I want to be able to authenticate using password and publicprivate keys, and be able to send and receive data. Having support for a shell server is fine, but it shouldnt be mandatory. p  pHas anyone had any experience with anything similar or can give me a pointer Perhaps there is something I missed about the above projects. p

On one of my view controllers I have a UITableView with each cell being a button that leads to a different view controller. On the first cell the user is supposed to be able to push a UIButton to run a method that starts counting time. When you run that method it activates a second UIButton that the user can push to stop counting time. While this is going on a UILabel on the right hand side of the cell shows the elapsed time.p  pIt has worked fine so far until a few days ago. I downloaded and started using Xcode 5.1 beta 5 and started working on the app in it. Now the UIButtons dont appear on my iPhone 5S or any of my testers that use iPhone 5S. It works on the iPhone Simulator and on real non5S iPhones including iPad.p  pI thought maybe it was a 64bit problem and Ive looked around my code and cant find anything that wouldnt work on 64bit devices. But I watched an Apple Developer Video that says that 32bit apps on 64bit devices will simply load the 32bit iOS libraries and run them like that. I havent enabled ARM64 on my app yet, since so far I havent had any problems with it on any device. Has there been a change in the iOS 7.1 SDK in beta 5 that requires tableviews or UIButtons to be called differently on 64bit devices I even tried it with a 64bit simulator and it works fine on it too.p  pI put the relevant code below.

Negative 5025 pIve a Image logo.jpg 800x800 uploaded in the Backend of typo3. This image is used in many different articles. Ive placed the image in these articles in many different sizes, sometimes 400x400, 200x200, etc..p  pSo typo has rendered the smaller version of the original 800x800 logo.jpg.p  pNow Ive to replace the logo with a newer version. I thought I can use the function replace file in the media backend from typo3. So i used this function and replaced the logo. Now the new file logo.jpg is in the backend, but all articles show the old version.p  pMy question is, is there another way to replace a previously used image Or is there a way to restart the rendering process in typo3 for all images. It looks like, the smaller version of the image are still in the cache or something like that. But clearing the cache doesnt help.p

Negative 5025 pI maintain a crossplatform C codebase and on a few platforms Xcode 4, Red Hat derived distros like Fedora and Mageia, I get the following compiler errorp  precodewarning declaration of index shadows a global declaration codepre  pBased on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma84409932038264this answera, I understand that this is because some BSDbased C implementations define a nonstandard codeindexcode function in codestring.hcode which means that this warning shows up whenever I declare an codeindexcode variable. I assure you that I do not have any global codeindexcode variables.p  pI know I can avoid naming anything codeindexcode but its a semantically useful name so I end up using it all over the place. I know I can also suppress this warning, for example by using codeWnoshadowcode in GCC, but Id rather not globally disable an otherwise useful compiler warning.p  pSo how can I solve this problem That is, is it somehow possible to detect if the platform has the codeindexcode function and disable the warning there only, or how can I redefine it if it existsp

What is the best way to simulate that p  pCurrently we do it like this p  precode[Test] public void UserCanAddAccountToCompany      var user        new User                  Name  Guid.NewGuid.ToString,           Email  Guid.NewGuid.ToString,           Pwd  password,           CompanyReference  new CompanyReference  Id  Guid.NewGuid.ToString, Name  Guid.NewGuid.ToString              var response  new TestBrowserltUsergtUserSignUp, user.Response      var paramUserAccount  new ParamUserAccount              User  response.Body.DeserializeJsonltResultgt.User,         Account  new Account  Name  Guid.NewGuid.ToString            var response2  new TestBrowserltParamUserAccountgtaccountcreate, paramUserAccount.Response     var res  response2.Body.DeserializeJsonltResultgt      Assert.NotNullres.Account.Id     Assert.NotNullres.Account.Name  codepre  pSo we create a user , call user signup end point and then take the params from response and call creat accoutn end point. The obvious problem with this approach is that if you do a change in signup endpoint and for some reason you break it, all tests like this will fail. p  pSo my question is...whats the right approach on that p

Negative 5025 pcomtypes are imported in pythonp  pWhen a cell is selected in excel file, selection property returns the correct range object and properties are accessible. But when a chart is activated or user selected then selection property does not return the correct object i.e. none of the chartObject, chart, chartArea objects, or for that matter when navigating inside the chart using arrow keys, selection doesnt provide the expected object I checked them trying to access their relevant properties. In fact I am not sure it is providing anything usefulp  pBut if I use ActiveChart property, it gives me the correct chart object and properties are accessible.p  pWhat could be the reason behind this and what is the solution. I am doing this in python. part of an open source screen reader NVDA Exact code looks like this  p  precodedef scriptswitchToChartself,gesture     try         chart  self.excelCellObject.parent.ChartObjects1 parent is the worksheet     except COMError,NameError,AttributeError         chart  None     if chart         chart.Activate         chart.Index         chartObj  self.excelCellObject.Application.ActiveChart gives chart object         chartObj  self.excelCellObject.Application.Selection Doesnt work codepre  pUpdate  I tried same thing in excel VBA and everything is working fine. Selection property returns chartObject object when a chart is activated and subsequently corresponding objects when navigating inside the chart. So there must be some problem with python comtypes.p

Negative 5025 pI have a page that has three forms that are apparent to the user. Under the hood, the page has only ONE form, using htmlform as the JSP object controlling the entire page.

Negative 5025 pWe are building a single page front end only application. The application lets the user configure a product and share on facebook a url to the product configured. The application can rebuild the complete product again using the information present in the url. Based on the configuration, the title and the description. along with the image to be shared changes. The issue is,  I update the meta tags dynamically based on params present in the url. Since, the sharer.php takes in only the url as a parameter ulink, and looks at the OG meta tags, they are empty if you view src of the page. The share functionality does not work in our case, since the description, title, image changes from user to user. p  pIs there way to achieve this If OG meta tags are updated dynamically, the api should intelligent enough to understand and read the meta tags. There was a way to pass parameters earlier in the request so that OG meta tags are not read and information was derived from the url params, but new FB apis do not support parameterized request anymore.p

Is there any way I can get the node number of the memoryp  pThe reason that getting the node mask of the current thread does not work is that, the memory of the node is full, so even the thread is affined to the current node, it may still allocate the memory on the adjacent node.

Negative 5025 pI am using an ActiveX module written in C in Visual Studio 2012, and inserted it in  an Excel 2010 worksheet for use with VBA.p  pI have defined a number of methods and properties that I can invoke without a problem within VBA.p  pHowever, whenever I try to add a new method to the interface, weird things start to happen, such as the VBA interpreter compiler saying that the wrong number of arguments Error 450 are being used for a particular method foo, or even the VBA compiler complaining about syntax foo being wrong for a C function void foo.p  pMy guess is that the activeX control is somehow not updated correctly in the registry or so, such that the newly added method completely messes up the call interface. This would explain why for instance foo generates an error it may be interpreted as a property instead of a method p  pLast point I can see the newly defined method correctly in VBAs editor Object Browser p  pAnyway, I have tried the following Delete the activeX control from my XL form, remove the reference to the Control, save XL, and exit.

Negative 5025 pI have an application which uses Hibernate Search backed by Lucene indexes and Infinispan. I do emnotem  use Hibernate Core to load my data this should be fine since 3.2 I believe.p  pOn startup the application loads a lot of data into Infinispan caches from various sources. I found that if we left automatic indexing i.e. emnotem specifying hibernate.search.indexingstrategy  manual that the cache inserts and associated indexing used a lot of memory and would often not finish at all. To fix this I disabled automatic indexing, and after inserting all the initial data run a bulkmass indexer on the cache  this takes just a few seconds and works fine.p  pMy problem is that I periodically insertupdatedelete items from the caches, and I cannot find a way to tell either Infinispan or Hibernate Search to [re]index these items. The closest I can find from the a hrefhttpsdocs.jboss.orghibernatesearch3.1referenceenhtmlsearchbatchindex.html relnofollowHibernate Search Docsa involves a Hibernate session, and would only work on managed objects. I do not load data via Hibernate so this is not possible.p  pstrongHow can I index individual items via an API call to Infinispan or Hibernate Searchstrongp  pI look forward to any help you can provide, a let me know if you need any additional information.p  pThanks, Jamesp

Negative 5025 pnot sure if this is possible, I have an icecast server configured and streaming music, and I want to create a web player using Java or grails. I managed to get the java web app playing the music icecast is streaming, using something like thisp  precodeAudioInputStream stream  AudioSystem.getAudioInputStreamnew URLhttplocalhost8000musicstation     codepre  pand after a few more lines the music is playing, the problem is that if I close the tab with the web app the music keeps playing, I have to stop the application to stop playing, but when I start it again and try to play again, its like the icecast server continued playing the song in the background, I mean, it didnt stop or paused, because of this I cannot implement a pause action, since if I pause, what it actually be paused will be the web app playing the song, but in the background icecast will continue transmitting the song, so that when I play again after paused, the song wont continue from the point it was paused.p  pIs using AudioInputStream the correct way to implement an icecast audio client I hope I could explain myself. thanksp

Negative 5025 pIm successfully streaming data from mongodb, using a mongodb river into elasticsearch and being displayed in Kibana.p  pThe problem Im facing is that I have fields using a numeric id value but it means nothing the user looking at the kibana dashboards.p  pFor example, I have a key in mongodb called Grade. These are the following values and the associated grade level I want to display in Kibanap  precodeValue    Grade Level   0      Normal   1      Noncritical   2      Critical   3      Unavailable codepre  pIm unable to modify how the source of this data is being written to the database.  Also, the data is constantly streaming so periodicallymanually updating fields in mongodb or elasticsearch is not going to work.  p  pThis seems like a simple issue but it not clear to me as to where I can address the problem.  Im not sure if the problem can be addressed at any specific level mongodb, mongodb river, or elasticserach with a mapping or script.  Note that there many more numeric codes in addition to my above example so I would also like to avoid using any aliasing at the kibana level.p  pAny suggestion on where and how to address this issuep  pThank youp

Negative 5025 pI want to enforce HTTPS for a Spring Boot application to be hosted at Pivotal CloudFoundry, and I think most of the applications would want this today. The common way of doing it, as I know, is using p  precodehttp.requiresChannel.anyRequest.requiresSecure codepre  pBut this is causing a redirect loop. The cause, as I understand by refering to posts like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7263888httpsnodeapponcloudfoundrythisa, is that the load balancer converts back https to http. That means, it has to be done at the load balancer level.p  pSo, is there some option to tell CloudFoundry to enforce HTTPS for an application If not, shouldnt this be a feature request And, what could be a good way to have this todayp  pstrongUpdatestrong Did any of you from Cloud Foundry or Spring Security team see this post I think this is an essential feature before one can host an application on CloudFoundry. Googling, I found no easy solution but to tell the users to use https instead of http. But, even if I tell so, when an anonymous user tries to access a restricted page, Spring Security is redirecting him back, to the http login page.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Of course, we have the codexforwardedprotocode header as many answers suggest, but I dont know how hard it would be to customize the features of Spring Security to use that. Then, we have other things like Spring Social integrating with Spring Security, and I just faced an issue there as well. I think either Spring Security and tons of other other frameworks will need to come out with solutions to use codexforwardedprotocode, or CloudFoundry needs to have some way to handle it transparently. I think the later would be far convenient.p

Negative 5025 pOver the past few months, weve been implementing an application using DDD amp CQRS.  One thing that I still struggle with is the best way to persist data, especially to multiple datasources of different types.p  pUp to this point, weve used a DAL interface layer, with multiple partial implementations of that DAL.  Then in our Domain layer, we use repositories to constructsave our domain objects to n number of DALs.  This works fine, until we get to some more advanced operations like pagination and searching.  This has required us to not only map our data, but map our orderingsearchingpagination criteria.p  pIve read opinions that we should just be exposing whatever the persistence layer is IE Entity Framework, Filesystem, web services to the DDD layer and have the repositories access those directly, so they can take advantage of the features built into things like ORMs.  This feels like a leaky abstraction to me.p  pIs there a pattern Im overlooking that will help us solve these issuesp

Negative 5025 pI need to run a logistic regression on a relatively large data frame with 480.000 entries with 3 fixed effect variables. Fixed effect var A has 3233 levels, var B has 2326 levels, var C has 811 levels. So all in all I have 6370 fixed effects. The data is crosssectional. If I cant run this regression using the normal glm function because the regression matrix seems too large for my memory I get the message Error cannot allocate vector of size 22.9 Gb. I am looking for alternative ways to run this regression on my Macbook Air OS X 10.9.5 8GB RAM. I also have access to a server with 16GB RAM.p  pI have tried solving the issue in a few different ways but so far none led to satisfactory resultsp  pstronglfefelmstrong  Using the felm regression function of the a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackageslfelfe.pdf relnofollowlfe packagea that subtracts fixed effects before running the regression. This works perfectly and allowed my to run the above regression as a normal linear model in just a few minutes. However, lfe does not support logistic regressions and glms. So felm was great for getting an idea about model fit for different models but doesnt work for the final logistic regression models.p  pstrongbiglmbigglmstrong  I thought about using a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesbiglmbiglm.pdf relnofollowbigglma to break my function into more manageable chunks. However, several sources e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10502882rbiglmwithcategoricalvariableslink1a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24317418modelrunwithglmbutnotbigglmlink2a, a hrefhttpblog.revolutionanalytics.com201405quickhistory2glmsrandlargedatasets.html relnofollowlink3a mention that in order for that to work, factor levels need be consistent across chunks, i.e. each chunk must contain at least one of each factor of each factor variable. Factor A and B contain levels that only appear once, so I cant split the sets into different chunks with consistent levels. If I delete 10 factors of fixed effect A and 8 factors of B a minor change I will only have factors with 4 levels left, and splitting my data into 4 chunks will make it a lot more manageable already. However, then I still need to figure out how to sort my df in a way that will ensure that my 480.000 entries are sorted into 4 chunks in which each factor level of each of the 3 factors appearing at least once.p  pstrongGlmmGSglmgsstrong The a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesglmmGSglmmGS.pdf relnofollowglmmgsa function in the package with the same name performs a fixedeffects subtraction like the lfe package for logistic regressions using a GaussSeidel Algorithm. Unfortunately, the package is no longer being developed. Being relatively new to R and having no deep experience with statistics I cant make sense of the output and have no idea of how to transform it in a way that would give me the normal effect size, model fit, significance interval indicators that glm regression summaries provide.p  pI sent a message to the packages authors. They kindly responded as followsp  blockquote   pThe package provides no output in the same format of a glm object. However, you   can easily calculate most of the fit statistics standard error of the   estimates, goodness of fit given the current output in the CRAN   version, I believe that the current output is a vector of estimate of   coefficients, and the associated vector of standard errors same for   the covariance components, but you need not worry about them if you   are fitting model without random effects. Only beware that the   covariance matrices used to calculated the standard errors are the   inverse of the diagonal blocks of the precision matrix associated with   the GaussSeidel algorithm, and so they tend to underestimate the   standard errors of the joint likelihood. I am not maintaining the   package any longer and I do not have time to get into the specific   details the seminal theory behind the package can be found in the   a hrefhttpwww.stat.missouri.eduguhasugaussseidel.pdf relnofollowpaper referenced in the manuala, everything else needs to be worked out   by you with pen and paper .p blockquote  pIf anyone can explain how to easily calculate most of the fit statistics in a way that someone without any education in statistics can understand it might be impossible or provide R code that shows on example of how this could be done I would be much obligedp  pstrongRevolution Analyticsstrong I installed revolution analytics enterprise on a virtual machine that simulates Windows 7 on my Mac. The program has a function called RxLogit that is optimized for large logistic regressions. Using the RxLogit function I get the error Failed to allocate 326554568 bytes. Error in rxCallRxLogit, params  bad allocation, so that function also seems too run into memory issues. However, the software enables me to run my regression on a distributed computing cluster. So I could just kill the problem by purchasing computing time on a cluster with lots of memory. However, I wonder if the revolution analytics program provides any formulas or methods that I dont know off that would allow me to do some kind of lfelike fixedeffects subtraction operation or bigglmlike chunking operation that takes factors into account.p  pstrongMatrixModelsglm4strong One person suggested I use the glm4 function of the MatrixModels package with the sparse  TRUE attribute to speed up calculation. If I run a glm4 regression with all fixed effects I get an Error in Choleskycrossprodfrom, LDL  FALSE     internalchmfactor Cholesky factorization failed error. If I run it only with the fixed effect variables B OR A and C, the calculation works and returns a glpModel object. As with glmmGS I have some issues in turning that output into a form that makes sense to me since the standard summary method does not seem to work on it.p  pI would be happy for advice on any of the issues mentioned above or also completely different approaches for running logistic regressions with multiple large fixed effects in R with memory constraints.p

Negative 5025 pIn my Android app Im doing a remote settings call in the Application class since it contains values I need for a library which must be initialised in the Application class onCreate.p  pTheres two big issues with this however. One being that I have to join the network thread with the main thread to make sure that we got the values before the end of the onCreate method. The other issue being that sometimes a call can take a long time to make so I would prefer showing a splash screen before making the call and then removing it when the call is done.

Negative 5025 pI need to create a unique identifier for clients, Im implementing this using a 9 digit Luhn 9th digit being the checkdigit, so I can validate its authenticity. The numbers I want to generate are random, so I create an 8 digit number and work out the check digit to go with it, thats all great.p  pMy problem is that I need to check that it doesnt already exist in my client table. I have added an index to ensure duplicate values cant be inserted, but am looking for a steer on how to lock the table involved within the transaction Ive created to ensure no concurrency issues arise, i.e. cant attempt to insert a duplicate.p  pAny suggestions on approach or recommendations welcome, I know this is probably a noddy question.p

Negative 5025 pThere seem to be multiple plugins written for monitoring cluster nodes with Nagios, however I run into the same problem with each one.p  pBasically, if I run the plugin script locally from the Cassandra node, it gives me the correct number of nodes that are up and healthy.p  pHowever if I try to run the command remotely from the nonCassandra nodeNagios Server, you have to use NRPE and no matter what using nrpecheck always returns that there are 0 nodes up and running.p  pI think this has to be some sort of issue with NRPE being unable to use the nodetool command since the plugins require nodetool to check status, however I have yet to be able to figure it out.  Ive even tried running the NRPE command nrpecheck locally on the Cassandra node using the datastaxCassandra user, and it still tells me there are zero nodes running. p  pI couldnt find anything helpful via googling, Im guessing maybe many folks dont bother and just use OpsCenter alarms but we have problems with OpsCenter taxing our cluster and causing other issues so most of the time its not running.p

Negative 5025 pI have developed an app for the website. I have used webview control to display web pages. Pages have links for different pdf files which are stored on either google dirve or dropbox. The problem is that when i click on the link that points to the pdf file stored on google dirve or dropbox, it displays download button in case of dropbox but when i click download button to actually download that file, it shows the process on task bar but download gets failed saying download unsuccessful. While in case of google drive, pdf files are viewed but has the same problem for the download. I have used download manager but still unable to download files. I have also tried number of solutions provided in stackflow but could not succeed. Can anyone help me in this regard please Here is the code that I have tried... I am hoping instant response.

Negative 5025 pstrongTried finding an answer here but cant. There was a duplicate question but all answers were with awk and sed which Im not allowed to use So once again, I ask you to help me.strongp  pBasically I need to write a script that prints out the history of all used commands in the linux terminal. The commands are saved in a file which is put as the first argument of the script. Command binbash equals bash so we dont mix things up. So, the print out should be sorted from commands with most occurrences to commands with least occurrences. Those with the same number of occ should be sorted in alphabetical order.p  pAnd, if we put switch n the script only prints out the first n commands. And with switch p we also include the commands that are part of the pipeline.p  pExample of history.txtp  ol lils alli libashli licat datoteka.txtli licat d.txt  sort  lessli libinbashli ol  pWhat the script should print outp  ul lip.hstat.sh history.txtp  ol libash 2li licat 2li lils 1li olli ul  pAs Im fairly new to BASH programming and not really good at it, I would love some help with this.

Negative 5025 pI am trying to match records from two tables without a common key and with some errors in the data. Specifically I have records in Table A for a given group and date that I want to match with records in Table B with the same group, but the date may differ. Additionally some records may only exist in table A or B.p  pstrongExample tablesstrongp  precodeTable A  id  group    date  ...   0      A  1115  ...  1      B  1315  ...  2      A  1515  ...  3      A  1515  ...                  99      Z  4515  ...  Table B  id  group    date  ...   0      A  1215  ...  1      A  1515  ...  2      A  1615  ...                  99      Z  4515  ... codepre  pHere I would want record 0 in table A to match with record 0 in table B even though the dates are different but are close, record 1 in table A is missing in table B, and there may be multiple records in table A or B with the same group and date these are not duplicates.p  pCurrently I am not matching records where the dates differ, but I am losing potentially useful data. Therefore I would like to iteratively improve the matching so that I have more complete matching. I think that a probabilistic approach would make the most sense rather than a deterministic one, but am open to arguments on this.p  pMy first question is what the right tool for this is. Currently the tables are in a PostgresSQL database and are large enough that it would be difficult to process them on a local machine. However I am not familiar with any way of performing probabilistic joins in Postgres, but I expect that Python has good enough support for probabilistic record linkage.p  pCan should this be done in Postgres or a different tool Python Can anyone direct me to any resources examples, code, etc.p

Are there other example applications where such computations are encountered even beyond signal processingp

Negative 5025 pHello hopefully I can be pointed in the right direction and gain some clarity as I am now confused.p  pI have a website that also has opencart Version 1.5.6.1 attached the two are styled to look the same. I have come to a point where I need users to log into services on MY website however I do not really want a user to create two sets of data, one for the shop and another for my services. I have done research and found I can just add info into the opencart database rather than having two independent databases.p  pAll was going well until I came to password encryption, opencart apparently uses salt sha1 Encryption p  pWhere as the tools I am using on the website have this code md5 encryptionp  precodecryptpwd  md5password codepre  pI know I am asking relatively stupid questions here but how would I add into my website code support for the same encryption Even just a pointer in the right direction would be helpful  p

Im not sure how to enter it into upper bounds as it only accepts doubles and that would be logical. I tried the Active Set Algorithm and that enabled the Nonlinear Constraint Function box and I think Im on the right track with that. If so, Im not sure what the syntax for entering my desired constraint. Another methodthat may or may not work I could think of is using this as an Upper Boundary.p  precode[minOptMat10, minOptMat10, minOptMat10, minOptMat10, minOptMat10]    codepre  pAgain, Im using the GUI Optimization Toolbox. I havent looked too much into command line optimization though I will need to write it command line eventually and I think I read somewhere that you can set the Upper Boundary and it does not have to be doublep  pThank you so very much for the help, if someone is able. I apologize if this is a really nooby question.p

Negative 5025 pSuppose I have a class codeAcode, and I need a codevectorcode of objects with class codeAcode. Is it better to use codestdvectorltAgtcode or codestdvectorltAgtcode I came across some lectures mentioned that the former doesnt require the definition of copy constructor and copy assignment operator while the latter requires definitions of both. Is this correctp

Negative 5025 pIn codeMainActivity.onStartcode of my app, it gets data from a RESTful service, populates a local SQLite db with data from the service, then populates a View with that data. Using RxJava, the functionality that calls the RESTful service and populates the SQLite is made to be the observable and the fragment containing the View uses RxJava to subscribe to this. When it is done, the View is notified and gets the data from the SQLite db.  During this process, a progress circle appears automatically, Ive added no progress bar code myself. When the View has been populated, the circle is no longer displayed. All is well.p  pWhen the device is turned from Portrait  Landscape or viceversa, my code recognizes this and skips the RESTful service and, using a similar observersubscriber mechanism, gets data from the SQLite db and populates the View. The progress circle is displayed again here but, this is the problem, it keeps spinning and never goes away, though the app continues to function normally.p  pWhat is causing this progress circle to appear How can I control itp  pFirst observersubscriberp  precodeMyListFragment myListFragment  MyListFragment getSupportFragmentManager.findFragmentByTaggetResources.getStringR.string.fragmentmaintag mLoadAndStoreDataObservable  Observable.create    new Observable.OnSubscribeltStringgt           Override          public void callSubscriberlt super Stringgt subscriber                try                   Utilities.loadAndStoreDatamActivity  call RESTful service, populate SQLite                  subscriber.onNextUtilities.loadAndStoreData Done                            catch Exception e               subscriber.onErrore                                            .subscribeOnSchedulers.io      .observeOnAndroidSchedulers.mainThread      .subscribemyListFragment codepre  pObserversubscriber when device is rotatedp  precodeMyListFragment myListFragment  MyListFragment getSupportFragmentManager.findFragmentByTaggetResources.getStringR.string.fragmentmaintag mLoadAndStoreDataObservable  Observable.create    new Observable.OnSubscribeltStringgt           Override          public void callSubscriberlt super Stringgt subscriber                try                   dont call restful service,  Just tell observer that data is available in SQLite                 subscriber.onNextUtilities.loadAndStoreData Done                            catch Exception e               subscriber.onErrore                                            .subscribeOnSchedulers.io      .observeOnAndroidSchedulers.mainThread      .subscribemyListFragment codepre  pMyListFragmentp  precodeOverride public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState      View view   super.onCreateViewinflater, container, savedInstanceState      setListAdapternull  see if this prevents progress circle ... nope     return view   Override public void onNextString s       SQLite is populated now, so display the data in the list view     ArrayListltMyListDatagt myListDataList  Utilities.getDataFromSQLitegetActivity     MyListAdapter adapter  new MyListAdaptergetActivity, android.R.layout.simplelistitem1, myListDataList     setListAdapteradapter  codepre  pThe device I am testing with is a 1st gen Nexus 7, Android 4.2.2 and a 2nd gen Nexus 7, Android 4.4.4p  pstrongAnswerstrongbr LordRaydenMK suggests that the default ListView implementation shows a spinner when the list doesnt have an adapter set This indeed appears to be the case.

Negative 5025 pIm developing an Android application that allow to view the results of hockey matches. Im using a codeViewPagercode with a custom codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode to display three fragments,and a codeNavigationDrawercode with an codeExpandableListViewcode,used to display the championships. When I click on the codeExpandableListViewcode childrens,I want to update the three fragments with the data of the selected championship.p  pI set an codeOnchildClickListenercode in the codeNavigationDrawercode,where I istantiated a codeFragmentManagercode and called codereplacecode method. But it just returns a blank screen.p  pI searched in every forum and tried different solutions,but no one was effective When I use codeft.addcode instead of codeft.replacecode and I refresh the page with the codeSwipeRefreshLayoutcode,I get the correct result,but I want to get it without manually refreshing the page. I also tried to replace codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode with codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercode,but nothing changed.p  h2NavigationDrawerFragmenth2  precode package com.dcdeveloper.fihresults      public class NavigationDrawerFragment extends Fragment              Immagazzina lo stato della posizione dellelemento selezionato.           private static final String STATESELECTEDPOSITION  selectednavigationdrawerposition             Per the design guidelines, you should show the drawer on launch until the user manually       expands it.

The problem is, i have to create tokens that are either p  ul liUsable on time onlyli liexpire in short time like 30 secondsli ul  pbut howp  pp I really dont want to store tokens because i have 1M users and storing tokens for each request they make is just not manageable  P I also cant put user device time in token since it may not be correct I already write an algorithm that works like this brbr String token  some random string  date time  hash of random string and time brbr Now in my server i can check if time is not expired yet and hash code is correct. But if some of user dont adjust time on their device correctly they will be blocked too  p So what are my alternative p

Negative 5025 pAlright, so I had my socket.io server listening on a different port, but in order to get it to work with https, I needed to have it listen without passing in a port default. It works fine on a different port loaded with http, but I need it to work on httpsp  pMy project was working fine, client could connect and send data fine. However, I moved the site over to my main domain, which has an SSL certificate. The site loads everything via https, so it couldnt load the http version of codesocket.io.jscodep  pHowever, now that I switched it to just codevar client  requiresocket.io.listen.socketscode instead of listening on a differentspecific port , its still not working. Instead of giving me a connection error, its not including the file at all. p  pMy fear is that Id end up needing to remake my whole site to host my files via node.js and Id rather not have to do that. p  pIm not using any other module than codemysqlnodecode and codesocket.iocode, and Id prefer to keep it that way if possible. I am new to node.js, so Im sorry if theres an obvious answer that Im unaware of. p  pI looked around, however, and cant seem to find the answer anywhere. Or, at least a clear answer.p  pWould I be better off using codewebsocketscode instead of codesocket.iocode  If so, how would I go about doing this Id be more willing to remake my node application instead of remaking my site, honestly. p  pI am including the socket.io.js file in the clientside like so p  precodeltscript srchttpsmysitesocketiosocket.io.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pbut of course, 404 since its not an actual file thats on my apache server. Theres no folderdirectory named codesocketiocode in my codepublichtmlcode directory, so that makes sense to me. p  pBut, how can I get this to work Would I need to host my files via node.js or would I be better off using HTML5 websockets A fairly large demographic of my sites users use mobile devices, so Id have to be sure it works on mobile as well.p

I realized that I am querying all the collection so it is obviously retrieving all the documents stored inside that collection.p  pWhat is the best way to differentiate documents while querying so that I can query them separately by typep  pI can add a type field to the document and can get by codeWHERE typeusercode but Im not sure that I cannot do codeSELECT  FROM userscode with codeuserscode being a document type if there is such a thing in DocumentDB, not a collection.p  pHere is how I am creating documentsp  precode    var user1 new User              UserTypeId  0,         UserName

Negative 5025 ol lipIs there any limit on maximum number of concurrent connections I can make to stream data in parallel from S3 I am using the java SDK. I have set the max connections in the ClientConfiguration to 200. But is there any hard limit imposed by the client or serverpli lipFrom S3 documentationp  pWhen you download an object, you get all of objects metadata and a stream    from which to read the contents. You should read the content of the stream as quickly as possible because the data is streamed directly from Amazon S3 and your network connection will remain open until you read all the data or close the input streampli ol  pWhat if the connection is open for a long time I believe S3 closes the connection from server side after certain amount of time which is quite low. Because I have experienced connection closed by server errors in past. But is there any timeout period which can be used to make sure the connection is not closedp

Negative 5025 pI have a MySQL table that manages jobs that workerclients can lease for processing. Apart from the columns that describe the job, the table has a unique primary key column codeidcode, a timestampcolumn codeleasecode, a booleancolumn codecompletecode, and an intcolumn codeprioritycode.p  pIm trying to write a set of SQL statements that will manage the leasingprocess. My current plan is to find the first incomplete job that has a leasedate that is at least 8 hours in the past no job should take more than one hour, so an incomplete lease that is emthatem old probably means that the client died and the job needs to be restarted, set its leasedate to the current timestamp, and return its info. All of this, of course, needs to happen atomically.p  pI found a neat trick a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2460707howtoatomicallyclaimaroworresourceusingupdateinmysql24623042462304here on SOa and a variation of it in the discussion of the MySQL documentation a hrefhttpsdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0enupdate.html relnofollowsee post on 72904 herea that uses userdefined variables to return the leased job from an codeUPDATEcode statement.p  pAnd, indeed, this works finep  precodeUPDATE jobs SET leaseNOW WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFFHOUR,lease,NOWgt8 AND NOT complete AND idid LIMIT 1 SELECT  FROM jobs WHERE idid codepre  pThe problem comes in when I try to add priorities to the jobs and add codeORDER BY prioritycode into the codeUPDATEcode statement right before codeLIMITcode. The codeUPDATEcode still works as expected, but the codeSELECTcode always returns the same row back either the first or the last, but not the one that was actually updated. Im a little confused by this, since codeLIMIT 1code should make sure that the first update that actually happens will terminate the codeUPDATEcode process, leaving codeidcode set to the correct value of that updated row, no For some reason it seems to keep evaluating the condition codeididcode for all rows anyways, even after its done with its update or maybe it evaluates it first for all rows before even figuring out which one to update, I dont know....p  pTo fix this, I tried rewriting the statement to make sure the variable really only gets set for the matching rowp  precodeUPDATE jobs SET leaseNOW,idid WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFFHOUR,lease,NOWgt8 AND NOT complete ORDER BY priority LIMIT 1 codepre  pBut for some reason, this gives me the following errorp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeError Code  1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near idid WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFFHOUR,lease,NOWgt8 AND NOT complete ORDER BY prior at line 1 codepre  pSo, it seems that I cant assign the variable in the codeSETcodepart of the the codeUPDATEcode although this was the way it was suggested in the SOanswer linked above.p  pCan this approach be salvaged somehow or is there a better one altogetherp  pemPS Im using MySQL server v5.5.440deb8u1emp
Negative 5025 pI am having some serious trouble getting my multiline label to show all of its lines. Often, the last line of the label simply does not appear, but it is apparent that the dynamically calculated cell height has taken in to account that it should have appeared, leaving around the appropriate amount of white space left over in my cell. p  pThe affected label can display 17 lines depending on the data. I have played around with many various constraints to try and get it to display but regardless of what is on the last line, it just wont display. p  pThe weird thing is, sometimes it will display when I segue in to the VC, but then when I use the segmented controller inside the VC to display different data and then go back again, the last line will again not display. The opposite happens frequently too last line of label cutting off when I segue in to the VC, but then using the segmented controller inside the VC to change the displayed data and then go back, it will then display fine.p  pThings I have ensured The label is set to word wrap, has line count of 0, has a height greater than or equal to the height of one of its lines, its resistance and vertical content hugging is set to the highest of anything in the cell, and the width is set appropriately. p  pThe below code is how I determine how many lines the label will havep  precodelet descString  NSMutableAttributedString  let bountyStart  NSMutableAttributedStringstring Bounty , attributes [NSFontAttributeName  UIFont.boldSystemFontOfSize15] let bountyDesc  NSMutableAttributedStringstring bounty.description descString.appendAttributedStringbountyStart descString.appendAttributedStringbountyDesc  let bLine  NSMutableAttributedStringstring nn, attributes [NSFontAttributeName  UIFont.systemFontOfSize2] descString.appendAttributedStringbLine  if bounty.turtles  0.0     let turtleStart  NSMutableAttributedStringstring Your turtle count      let turtleAmount  NSMutableAttributedStringstring bounty.turtleCount.description     descString.appendAttributedStringturtleStart     descString.appendAttributedStringturtleAmount  descriptionLabel.attributedText  descString codepre  pIn the screen shot below, you can see that the height of the cell is being calculated appropriately but for some reason, the last line of the label just refuses to show.

Negative 5025 pI have a usercontrol with grid as content panel, which loads its content from datatemplate, specified in xaml where usercontrol is used.p  pI am using this usercontrol widely and everything is fine with standard xaml controls in template. now I am trying to show some charts in this control with OxyPlotp  precode   ltDataTemplate xKeySomeChartgt         ltGrid xNameoxyGrid gt             ltoxyPlotView xNameoxyChart ModelBinding model gt         ltGridgt     ltDataTemplategt codepre  pI initialize data model for the chart in usercontrolloaded but the chart will not be shown until I manually call InvalidateMeasure for it. if I call invalidatemeasure from usercontrolloaded , it will not help.p  pif I call invalidatemeasure from any point when chart is on the screen  it helps and chart will shows up.p  pcurrently, I found that I can call invalidatemeasure in usercontrollayoutupdated handler but dont like as it fires too often and requires code outside of usercontrol.p  pif I try to handle event layoutupdated inside usercontrol and call invalidatemeasure for oxychart from there, I am getting Layout cycle detected.
