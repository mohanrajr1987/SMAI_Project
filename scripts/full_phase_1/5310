Positive 5310 pI have a homework in which my professor gave us a java program inside a directory named example and asked us to copy that directory to a new directory named fixedExample.

After that we can start working on the code to fix it. p  pMy problem is that I cant find a way to modify binfixedExample since it is a run file. p

Negative 5310 pI asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions269417whichlanguageshouldiusea questiona earlier about which language to use for an AI prototype. The consensus seemed to be that if I want it to be fast, I need to use a language like Java or C, but that Python  Perl  Ruby would be good for the interface bits. p  pSo, this leads me on to another question. How easy is it to link these languages together And which combination works best So, if I wanted to have a Ruby CGItype program calling C or Java AI functions, is that easy to do Any pointers for where I look for information on doing that kind of thing Or would a different combination be betterp  pMy main experience with writing web applications started with C CGI and then moved on to Java servlets about 10 years ago and then after a long gap away from programming I did some PHP. But Ive not had experience of writing a web application in a scripting language which then calls out to a compiled language for the speedcritical bits. So any advice will be welcomep

Negative 5310 pI am writing a web app for a client. Users will have a onetime key that they will use to initially identify themselves to the app. Once the app verifies that the key is valid it will take them to a page where they can create a normal account to use for all subsequent logins. The createaccount page should only be accessible after entering the key and shouldnt be accessible otherwise. I.e, it shouldnt be accessible to users logged in with a normal account.  This is asp.net 3.0 using a custom membership provider.p  pMy plan is to create a temporary account based on the key and authenticate the user with that account. This allows them access to the createuser page which is protected with a location tag  where they can create the formal account. I then authenticate them with their new account and delete the temporary account.  The flow is the user goes to a page where they enter the key. If the key is valid I create the temporary account, call FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie, and redirect to the createaccount page. This all works, although it seems a little complicated.p  pThe problem is that the createuser page is available to any authenticated user I only want it available during the time between entering the key and creating the formal account. So I thought Id create a special role for the temporary account and make the createuser page accessible only to that role and none other.  I created my own Principal object with a special role and tried setting it when I authenticate the temporary account but I cant get that to work.p  pIm really hoping I dont have to write a custom role provider just to do this.p  pHow can I make this work Theres gotta be a simpler wayp

Negative 5310 pDoes Java andor Spring have the concept of properties I have bunch of domain models, each of which has several properties.

Each property name, date of birth, height, etc would have the display name, format, and description used for help or tooltips.

However, I was under the impression that these php codeigniter plugin libraries were in lieu of SSL was I completely mistaken here  If I am mistaken, is there a secure way of accomplishing this without SSL In the past I have used a javascript md5 hash function to encrypt the password before posting it...but I was hoping for something more secure.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Okay  so it seems like the consensus is that I should be using SSL.  If this is the case, then what is the point of all those fancy php authentication libraries that perform all sorts of hashing.

All the io Im using is simple java io, not nio.p  pIf I create the input stream and just never read from it, can that buffer fill up and cause problems  If so, is there something I can do or a property I can set to have it just throw away data that it seesp  pNow what if the server doesnt create the input stream at all  Will that cause any problems on the clientsending sidep  pPlease let me know.p  pThanks, jbup

Negative 5310 pI am currently developing a system that holds all relevant master data like for example a customer, or information about an operational system that exists within our system landscape.  The assigned IDs to these entities are unique within the enterprise. When some system stores e.g. customer related data, it has to hold the master data ID of the customer as well. The master data system is based on .Net and a MSSQL 2005. p  ol lipNow my question is, when developing another system with its own assemblies, database, etc., that uses data of the MDM system, would you store that data redundantly in the other systems database, create its own business entities like customer and hard code the required master data from the MDM in the other database or by ETL That way the other system is detached from the MDM but only stores the global Master Data IDs.pli lipOr would you integrate the assemblies of the MDM into other systems if .Net of course and use the data layer of the MDM to load global entities like a customerpli lipOr would you let the other system create its own entities but for retrieving master data you would use a SOAP interface provided by the MDM.pli ol  pI tend to use the approach no. 1 because I think its better to detach other systems from the MDM solution separation of concerns. Since the MDM solution can hold much more data of a customer entity than I would need in some other system where a just the customers name is required. Option 3 would be possible but web services might slow down an operational system alot. What do you thinkp

Is there a proper way to tune for example the BTree of Berkley DB node size etc...p  pAs an comparision, after tuning tokyo cabinet, it loads 1 billion keys in 25min.p  pP.S. Im looking for tuning tips as a code and not parameters to set for a running system like jvm size etc...p
Negative 5310 pSome time ago my company was evaluating different reporting solutions. We settled on MS SSRS particularly because its capable of connecting to various types of data stores, including MS SQL, Oracle and SAP Netweaver BI. It has proven the test of time pretty well, however, were now under fire from management because SSRS is not capable of mixing data sources into the same data set.p  pSo, I searched long and hard for a reporting solution that can inner join data from separate systems, but I came up short. I am about to propose that we custom write reports ASP.NET for these crosssystem report requests, but I wanted to ping the internet first for any advice.p  pHow do you inner join across your massive enterprise systems for reporting purposesp

Negative 5310 pIm not sure whats happening here, but Im running MAMP 1.9 on MAC OS X.  In my httpd.conf file, the DocumentRoot is set to the default htdocs path.  Within the htdocs folder, Ive created a number of subsites in an effort to set them up as Virtual Hosts.... I can get to the paths specified, but they all seem to default to the first one I set up.  p  pEssentially, the first VirtualHost I configured was for site1.localhost.com.  Ive since configured site2.localhost.com and site3.localhost.com.  However, going to either of the last two addresses, always seems to redirect me to site1.localhost.com.  Additionally, going to just localhost.com8888 also just pulls up site1.localhost.com.  Im not sure where I made a misstep, but hopefully someone here will be able to help me figure out the problem...

Negative 5310 pThe top level layout in my activity is a framelayout. I have completed, debugged and tested this app and it works exactly like it should in all respects on my g1 and  on various emulators. But on 3.7inch displays running 2.1, some imageviews packed in a linearlayout are strongperiodicallystrong not visible. I know that they are there because you can touch and drag them with effect in the app. So I assume somehow they have gotten under the SurfaceView that is the main component of the app. This is apparently so even though the SurfaceView is declared in the xml prior to the LinearLayout.  However, the ImageViews IN the LinearLayout are added programmatically towards the end of onCreate.p  pFramelayout stacks everything that is added to it, one on top of the otherthe only way you will see more than one child of a frame layout is if they are smaller than the screen and are placed apart from eachother.p  pOddly, sometimes the imageviews ARE visibleit is random. Anyway, Ive been trying to combat this with framelayout.bringChildToFrontView v on the linearlayout without success.p  pI wonder if anyone has any insight into how the behavior could be random like that, and how I should code these imageviews to keep this from happening, and why the problem appears only to occur on 3.7 vs 3.2 inch screens as it happens, the two 3.2inch screens were both htc, so vendor might be factor too.p  p[edit] Actually, Ive determined that this is a 2.2 issue, not a screen size or even vendor issue.  Cant ensure that ImageViews added to a framelayout with a SurfaceView  in it will appear on top of the surfaceview.  I ran some tests in the respective onDraw methods and the imageviews are visible 0, and nothing does anything to the alpha of the drawables, which are there as well at ondraw.

Negative 5310 pSo Im working on some pixel shaders for good old emulators like Super Nintendo. You have the classic algorithms like HQnx, 2xSaI, etc, and they are definitely written to run on CPUs and be scaled exactly to twice the size before blitting to the screen.p  pMoving on to GPU fragment shaders, these algorithms can be done essentially for free. Im working with OpenGL and CgGLSL, but this question should apply to Direct3DHLSL coders as well.p  pThe major problem is that these algorithms blend against neighboring pixels using some algorithm to decide on the color. However, I found this concept quite hard with shader languages. Generally with fragment shaders you are able to get a floating point texture coordinate, which you can use to do texture lookups, usually with GLLINEAR used as texture filter. Most pixels shaders use GLNEAREST, and do the smoothing themselves.p  pThe problem occurs if I want to find, say, the exact neighbor pixel. Ive seen some implementations but they occasionally cause artifacts on the screen. Probably due to floating point inaccuracies that occur. Ive found that most of the artifacts simply disappear when using poweroftwo sized textures, which further strengthens my belief there are floating point inaccuracies going on. Here is a sample fragment shader in Cg that shows the issuesp  precodestruct output     float4 color  COLOR   struct input    float2 videosize   float2 texturesize   float2 outputsize   struct deltas     float2 UL, UR, DL, DR    output mainfragment float2 tex  TEXCOORD0, uniform input IN, uniform sampler2D sp  TEXUNIT0     float2 texsize  IN.texturesize    float dx  powtexsize.x, 1.0  0.25    float dy  powtexsize.y, 1.0  0.25    float3 dt  float31.0, 1.0, 1.0     deltas VAR          tex  float2dx, dy,       tex  float2dx, dy,       tex  float2dx, dy,       tex  float2dx, dy         float3 c00  tex2Dsp, VAR.UL.xyz    float3 c20  tex2Dsp, VAR.UR.xyz    float3 c02  tex2Dsp, VAR.DL.xyz    float3 c22  tex2Dsp, VAR.DR.xyz     float m1dotabsc00c22,dt0.001    float m2dotabsc02c20,dt0.001     output OUT    OUT.color  float4m1c02c20m2c22c002.0m1m2,1.0    return OUT  codepre  pIs there some way to make sure that we can grab the color data from the pixel we expect and not a different one I believe this problem occurs since we might be query a pixel from a coordinate that is just between two pixels if that makes sense. Hopefully there is some builtin function into these shader languages Im overlooking.p

Negative 5310 pIm creating a table view controller for an iPad app. This view will potentially be displayed fullscreen or within a modal view, so the size could be different each time its displayed.

Negative 5310 pIve been handed an application to support, and Im trying to figure out how to do it. I do have the source, and can make some changes, but I obviously dont want to completely change the architecture of the application.p  pThe app is in a VS2010 solution composed of 9 different projects.  The main one is a Windows Form application, but it spins off others in other threads.p  pHeres the difficulty.  Even though the different projects are parts of the same solution, they are separate executables, not DLLs.  When the main program starts one of the other projects, it does so by creating a new process, setting the filename of the executeable, the startup arguments and other assorted parameters into the process.StartInfo object, and then calls process.Start.p  pHow can I set breakpoints and debug subordinate executables  I cant attach to them until they are loaded, but they dont get loaded until process.Start is called, and by then its too late.  Is there a method call I can insert into the main program to get it to load the executable so I can set breakpoints in it before it actually begins executionp  pThanks.p

Negative 5310 pUsing interfaces wont work because I want a single implementation.

Negative 5310 pThe general question is how to return additional information from methods, beside the actual result of the computation. But I want, that this information can silently be ignored.p  pTake for example the method codedropWhilecode on codeIteratorcode. The returned result is the mutated iterator. But maybe sometimes I might be interested in the number of elements dropped.p  pIn the case of codedropWhilecode, this information could be generated externally by adding an index to the iterator and calculating the number of dropped steps afterwards. But in general this is not possible.p  pI simple solution is to return a tuple with the actual result and optional information. But then I need to handle the tuple whenever I call the method  even if Im not interested in the optional information.p  pSo the question is, whether there is some clever way of gathering such optional informationp  pMaybe through codeOption[X gt Unit]code parameters with callback functions that default to codeNonecode Is there something more cleverp

It currently uses jQuerys hover mouseover and mouseout to show dropdown navigation in each LI.p  pHow can I make it so instead of triggering the dropdown when hoving over the LI it will be triggered when mousing over the anchor tag When I changed it to the anchor the dropdown always disappears when mousing down over top of it, but it works fine when I set the LI to as the target for the hover I guess because all of the dropdown code is wrapped in the LI so the cursor is still hovering over the LI.p  pI need to set it up this way due to the design, so there isnt any way to change it. I need the hover to be triggered just from the anchor and not the LI. p

Negative 5310 pI am developing a crossplatform fractal explorer using Qt. I am experiencing a performance problem specifically when running on a single core CPU under Windows XP program compiled with MSVC Express 2010, I havent tried other versions of Windows. With two cores the program runs fine. It also runs fine under Linux with either one core or two cores compiled with GCC.p  pThe performance problem is something to do with calling a slot in the widget via the signal in the calculation thread. The widget contains a QImage and I pass a pointer to its pixels to the calculation thread. The thread calculates the fractal and plots the pixels to the image. At the end of each row, the thread emits a signal to the widget to tell it to update the display in the main thread. As I understand it, this is a queued connection.p  pWith Windows and a single CPU the update is very slow, much slower than the calculation. It makes the program unusable.p  pThe relevant code is similar to the Mandelbrot example in the Qt docs, except my signal has no arguments because the Qimage is located in the widget not the thread and I do not convert the QImage to a QPixmap.p  pDoes anybody have any ideas of what the problem could be and how to go about solving it Is it something to do with scheduling, time slicing allocation Is there a compiler flag in MSVC that I need to set Or do I need to modify my program some howp  pThanks very muchp

Negative 5310 pI am aware of the many questions regarding waitpid and timeouts but they all cover this by killing the child from within an alarm handler.p  pThat is not what i want, i want to keep the process running but dispatch it from waitpid.p  pThe underlaying problem I try to solve is a daemon process with a main loop that processes a queue. The tasks are processed one at a time.p  pIf a task hangs the whole main loop hangs. To get around this codeforkcode and codewaitpidcode seemed an obvious choice. Still if a task hangs the loop hangs.p  pI can think of workarounds where i do not use waitpid at all but i would have to track running processes another way as i still want to process one task at a time in parallel to possibly hanging tasks.p  pI could even kill the task but i would like to have it running to examine what exactly is going wrong. A kill handler that dumps some debug information is also possible.p  pAnyway, the most convenient way to solve that issue is to timeout waitpid if possble.p  pEditp  pThis is how I used fork and waitpid and it may be clearer what is meant by child.p  precodemy pid  fork  if pid  0      i am the child and i dont want to die  elsif pid gt 0      waitpid pid, 0      i am the parent and i dont want to wait longer than timeout      for the child to exit  else      die Could not fork  codepre  pEditp  pUsing waitpid WNOHANG does what I want.

Negative 5310 pIm the lead author of a hrefhttpormlite.comORMLitea which uses Java annotations on classes to build database schemas.  A big startup performance problem for our package turns out to be the calling of annotation methods under Android 1.6.  I see the same behavior up through 3.0.p  pWe are seeing that the following simple annotation code is emincrediblyem GC intensive and a real performance problem.  1000 calls to an annotation method takes almost a second on a fast box.  The same code running on my Mac Pro can do 28 million sic calls in the same time.  We have an annotation that has 25 methods in it and wed like to do more than 50 of these a second.p  pDoes anyone know why this is happening and if there is any work around  There are certainly things that ORMLite can do in terms of caching this information but is there anything that we can do to fix annotations under Android  Thanks.p  precodepublic void testAndroidAnnotations throws Exception      Field field  Foo.class.getDeclaredFieldfield     MyAnnotation myAnnotation  field.getAnnotationMyAnnotation.class     long before  System.currentTimeMillis     for int i  0 i lt 1000 i         myAnnotation.foo     Log.itest, in   System.currentTimeMillis  before  ms  TargetFIELD RetentionRUNTIME private static interface MyAnnotation      String foo  private static class Foo      MyAnnotationfoo  bar     String field  codepre  pThis results in the following log outputp  precodeITestRunner  895 started testAndroidAnnotations Ddalvikvm  895 GC freed 6567 objects  476320 bytes in 85ms Ddalvikvm  895 GC freed 8951 objects  599944 bytes in 71ms Ddalvikvm  895 GC freed 7721 objects  524576 bytes in 68ms Ddalvikvm  895 GC freed 7709 objects  523448 bytes in 73ms Itest      895 in 854ms codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter candrews pointed me in the right direction, I did some poking around the code.  The performance problem looks to be caused by some terrible, gross code in codeMethod.equalscode.  It is calling the codetoStringcode of both methods and then comparing them.  Each codetoStringcode use codeStringBuildercode with a bunch of append methods without a good initializing size. Doing the code.equalscode by comparing fields would be significantly faster.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAn interesting reflection performance improvement was given to me.  We are now using reflection to peek inside the codeAnnotationFactorycode class to read the list of fields directly.  This makes the reflection class 20 emtimesem faster for us since it bypasses the invoke which is using the codemethod.equalscode call.  It is not a generic solution but heres the Java code from a hrefhttpormlite.svn.sourceforge.netviewvcormliteormliteandroidtrunksrcmainjavacomj256ormliteandroidDatabaseTableConfigUtil.javaviewmarkupORMLite SVN repositorya.

Negative 5310 pI am using load to grab a section of a .php page and replace content in a div dynamically.p  pThe index page has a jqueryui tab widget on it that works fine upon initial load.

Negative 5310 pI am working on a multithreaded application which needs to update a Winforms control as it progresses A DataGridView. In order to prevent multiple access to the same shared resource, I started out with the following lock structurep  precodeif DGV.Columns.Count gt DesiredColumnCount return lockDGV      while DGV.Columns.Count lt DesiredColumnCount              DGV.Columns.AddnewColumn       codepre  pI then realized that, since the DGV was created on the UI thread, it needs to be code.Invokecoded. This changes the code top  precodeif DGV.Columns.Count gt DesiredColumnCount return lockDGV      DGV.Invokenew MethodInvoker gt                      while DGV.Columns.Count lt DesiredColumnCount                              DGV.Columns.AddnewColumn                        codepre  pMy question is Isnt this redundant the codelockcode will block the worker thread until it has exclusive access to codeDGVcode, and the codeInvokecode will block the worker thread until the UI thread can pick up the invoke request and execute the code. Cant I just get by using only the codeInvokecodep  pThat is the main question. Of course if there are any other multithreading sins in the above code, please commentp

Then switch to index thumbnail view. If I scroll to the end fast enough I can see that I can scroll faster than iBooks renders the pages but it catches up pretty quickly on iPad 2. I learn two things from thisp  ul liFirst iBooks is showing 140 empty squares in the right size and then populates the preview.li liiBooks really renders all of the previews and keeps them in memory if I scroll around I cannot spot any rerenderingli liI also tested with another Adobe Spec that has 700 pages exactly same behavior Fascinatingli ul  pThe question is how are they doing it I wrote some code that gets each page of the PDF as an image, adds it to a UIImageView and adds that to the scrollview.p  pI use the same technique and layout as iBooks does. It renders just as quick as iBooks but memory consumption is insane and especially when scrolling the app gets totally stuck after a while. Can anybody point me in the right direction I already removed the PDF rendering for testing and it is really fast, so I can pin it down to the thumbnail generation.p  pstrongEDITstrong If from the code below the PDF generation is removed and an empty codeUIImageViewcode is returned instead, the performance is still extremely weak. So my assumption is that the UIImageView is causing the problem.

Negative 5310 pIm experiencing an issue with chromes click behavior. There are cases havnt been able to isolate the exact conditions, maybe dragging, dblclick, too quick... no idea chrome will stop triggering the onmouseup event and the tabs wont slide anymore Tested the issue on ff and ie, which work fine. I did however notice that there is a workaround by setting the return value to false. This isnt useful on a website as this would disable any clicking action... I cant seem to find anybody else with this exact same issue. This is the page a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsteveterm7T9N8 relnofollowJS Fiddleap  pNote 1 If the animation function is called directly  overriding any click events no issues occur. Hence, I believe its an onmouse issue in chrome Note 2 user824294 explained he believes its got to do with dragging text. Ive sat at this issue for a couple evenings now. Help much appreciated p

Negative 5310 pI launched a website this weekend for a client of mine. It looks good in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, and IE 9.p  pHowever, IE 7 and 8 maybe 6 too are giving me real issues. The home page is fine but the secondary pages have a different theme layout. p  pI edited the Twentyeleven Wordpress theme. I have a Mac so it is hard for me to test IE since it is a Windows browser. I have an XP laptop that has IE 8 installed on it. That is how I know it is messed up. The secondary pages are really bad. p  pMy main content, left side bar, and footer are all misaligned. I have tried several things to try and fix the problem. I researched hacks and tried them but to no avail. p  pI tried changing the positioning on my images but it just made the page look even worse than it does now.

Negative 5310 pIs there any way to speed up a call to the strongJAXBstrong codeMarshaller.marshalObject, OutputStreamcodep  pThe project Im working on is using JAXB to [un]marshal objects with a fairly large XML schema.  The call codesomeJaxbMarshaller.marshalresults, outcode takes 2 seconds to complete.  Everything else JPA fetching, spatial filtering, quite a bit of other logic takes only about 1 second.  So the use of JAXB is tripling my request response time.  Im caching the JAXBContext and Marshaller objects, to speed things up as much as I can.  Its only the actual marshalling that is slowing me down.  Any suggestionsp  pIm using strongJAXB 2.2.3u1strong, bundled with strongJAXWS 2.2.3strong.  Newer versions seem to break multiple things, so were locked into that version of JAXB overriding the Javaincluded emJAXWS 2.2.5em which uses emJAXB 2.2.4u1em  which we cant use, as it throws a codeNullPointerExceptioncode on load.  Were also on strongJDK 1.3.030strong, and this is being run in emEclipse Indigoem.  I saw a suggestion to use Woodstox, but emJAXWS 2.2.3em already includes it.  I tried swapping it out with the newest version, but that slowed down marshalling by 0.2 seconds.  Removing Woodstox had exactly the same performance as using the version included with JAXWS.p  pThe schema backing the objects being marshalled is about strong5 MBstrong in size.  The actual XML document that JAXB generates is strong117 KBstrong in size.p

Negative 5310 pHi there i need some information or general tips on a problem with maven.p  pContext We just migrated one big eclipse project into 4 maven project. Thats one step in the good direction We were building thatthose project with an ant script build.xml We were selecting the task to do ondemandp  pTo keep it simple here are the 4 project  Core, Client, Server, Admin. Each of those maven project build into a jar. This have been establish and it is working perfectly. Core is a dependency to Client and Server.p  pWe use JenkinsCI and Artifactory on a remote server.p  pProblem I need to create some kind of parent project that will build all those other maven project and add some task on demand that we were doing with an ant script.  Exemple We want to build locally So we dont use jenkins and artifactory on this side for our developper so they can test manually their update yes we have no test for now, we are working on a legacy system. On this build, we do not want to obfuscate the code or sign our jar..etc We also want a customer build The real release that we push on the server, so it does use jenkins and artifactory That will add some task on some of the 4 project like obfuscating the code, signing the jar ..etc For this customer build, we need to be able to select our dependency of a library onthefly or more like On demand. Our program is an extension to another software and all our customer dont use the same version. To make it simple the library y can be y2.0.1.jar or y2.0.2.jar.. etc  All of those task i need can be done in different mavenplugin with no problem. p  pQuestion What would be a good practice to solve my problem. We would really like to get rid of our ant script. Also we are cleaning a big big dirty project so i would like a clean solution without a lots of duplicated stuff or lots of manually task to do each time we want to build either locally or on the remote server for our customer.p  pIdea I though i could use different maven profile in all those 4 project as i saw there a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2132958anttomavenmultiplebuildtargetsant to maven  multiple build targetsa But i will have a seriously huge pom.xml for each project with lots of duplicated stuff so I really dont like this idea. I though we could have a parent maven project but this would contain no code so i think Im wrong with this idea also.p  pThank for answering and for your timep

Negative 5310 pIm trying to get a correctly rotated codeUIImagecode from an codeALAssetRepresentationcode using the codefullScreenImagecode method. I have several testing photos shot in various device orientations the photos show up correctly in the Photos app. The documentation for codefullScreenImagecode saysp  blockquote   pIn iOS 5 and later, this method returns a fully cropped, rotated, and   adjusted imageexactly as a user would see in Photos or in the image   picker.p      pTo create a correctlyrotated codeUIImagecode object from the codeCGImagecode, you use   codeimageWithCGImagescaleorientationcode or   codeinitWithCGImagescaleorientationcode, passing the values of codeorientationcode   and codescalecode.p blockquote  pGiven the docs, my code looks like thisp  precodeALAssetRepresentation rep  [asset defaultRepresentation] UIImage img  [UIImage     imageWithCGImage[rep fullScreenImage]     scale[rep scale]     orientation[rep orientation]] codepre  pBut the resulting codeUIImagecodes rotation is wrong.

Negative 5310 pIm currently trying to build a function for hunting down files in nested zips.  The general problem I can handle and Ive got my code working correctly.  The problem Im having is related to compression formats.p  pDefault zip files are not an issue, I open my zipinputstream, send it to my search function, check for each of the entries if it is a zip file and if so I wrap the inputstream in another zipinputstream and recurse.  The problem comes when I have a non standard zip compression.p  pI would like to make this function much more robust to be able to detect the compression format of the zip entry, wrap it in the correct deflater, and then wrap that in a zipinputstream so that I can recurse.  The problem is I dont know how to decode the compression settings.  I also dont know how to handle other zip compression formats.  p  pAny advice on how to make this function more flexible would be helpful.  I intend to integrate this into my own personal libraries so will be using this function from all sorts of directions in the future. p

Negative 5310 pHelpp  pI have a custom HttpModule that handles the Application.Error event. The module is working... it logs messages to the event log and I can see these messages... all the way through to the end of the module after it writes a custom response and calls response.flush. Roughly speaking the purpose of this module is to log the errors and to show a polite error message to the user configurable such that the message maymay not contain useful details about the error.p  pIn the applications web.config I have configured lthttpErrors errorModeDetailedgt and ltcustomErrors modeOff gt. In the applicationHost.config I have configured ltsection namehttpErrors overrideModeDefaultAllow gt. Also in the applicationHost.config I have configured lthttpErrors errorModeDetailedgt under a ltlocation pathdefault web sitemyvdirgt element.p  pThe yellow screen of death is still showing though for both local requests and remote requests.p  pThis seems to be a Win2008R2 issue... this all works in win2008 I just now loaded up my test environment and tried this. I doubt its x64 vs x86 related... but Win2008R2 is x64 only... and my Win2008 test environment is x86.p  pIve done a bit more poking at this. In Win2008 the lthttpErrors errorModeDetailedgt has no bearing. Without the custom error messages are displayed. With it the custom error messages are displayed. On Win2008R2 I see the same problem yellow screen regardless of httpErrorsErrorModeDetailed. p  pSo... perhaps my real queston is why the ltcustomErrors modeOff gt setting just isnt working on IIS7.5. If I set it to On I get the short ysod, set of Off I get the long ysod instead of my custom message from http handler, like what happens in IIS7 and IIS6, set to RemoteOnly I get the short ysod.p  pSEMISOLVED The application pool was set to Managed Pipeline Mode Integrated. Switching this to Classic mode allows the custom error details to be displayed. This doesnt explain why IIS7 win2008 x86 works with Integrated pipeline and IIS7.5 win2008r2 x64 needing classic pipeline. Any thoughtsp  pHelp immensely appreciatedp  pedit fix xml tags and added more information and SEMISOLVEDp

Well Ive got an answer myself.  You indeed have to mark exceptions as serializable.  They work fine without this attribute in same AppDomain.  However if you try to catch it from some other domain, it will have to get serialized in order to get across app boundaries.  And that is the main reason I found for this.p

Negative 5310 pUsing ASP.NET MVC 3 and Razor, I have a strongly typed view against codeMyViewModelcode class. Within the view I have an AJAX form that consists of a group of radio buttons. Below it, I have a normal HTML form that collects data for codeMyViewModelcode. Depending on which radio button is selected in the AJAX form, I want to update the HTML form with one set of default values or another. In the AJAX form, Im trying to post two pieces of data 1 a value that represents the option chosen basedon the radio button codevaluecode parameter, and 2 the codeModelcode from the view.

Negative 5310 pI need an algorithm to calculate best fit for rectangles in a larger rectangle.. and the larger rectangle changes size dynamically. More detailsp  pI am using the Code52 Metro UI project a hrefhttpcode52.orgmetro.css relnofollowhttpcode52.orgmetro.cssap  pI am using only ONE tile row and all the tiles have floatleft defined. This works beautifully when all the tiles are of the same size.. a user can resize the browser to any width and the tiles just drop down under each other. Now the problem comes in when I want different tile sizes. This breaks everything and is obviously why people generally design metro UIs as fixed width. Well, I need to go with a fluid layout if possible. Tile sizes are predefined as followsp  precodeSingle 130px x 130px Double Horizontal 130px x 280px Double Vertical 280px x 130px and Double Both 280px x 280px codepre  pContainer is fluid, so widthheight changes dynamically.p  pWhat I need is an algorithm to make a bestfit for the tiles.. so any empty spaces will only be at the bottomright corner and not mixed in with the tiles.

It works for the invalid class when I only allow the character class to repeat one timeand obviously the ip doesnt get matched, but when I allow the character class to repeat itself it matches the second period even  thought it isnt preceded by a character. I dont understand why.p  pIve even tried grouping everything with  and putting 1 after the escaped . and changing the w to az and replacing  with 1, nothing seems to require the period to surrounded by characters.p

Negative 5310 pI need to develop a web portal with multiple live stream publishers up to 4, and many viewers, using RTMP. p  pLive video publishers are well known and always the same, so in the case of using FMS since I have some experience with Flash and Influxis, I would have no problem of using FMLE for video publishers. But the problem is how to synchronize in the media server all 4 connections to show properly on the client side. I have tested the oneconnection live example that brings FMS and works fine.p  pVideo resolution is not an issue, since we dont mind low resolution 320x240 for example. Also, we need to develop the plaform by ourselves, not depending on external platforms of live streaming. Is there any tutorial or example to use as a start point p  pWhat would you suggest thanksp

Negative 5310 pMy certificates were expiring today and at this point, its totally expired, so I set out to renew the certificates. But the problem is, I cant get matching privatepublic keys for proper codesigning verification with the renewed certificates.  All Ive read says keychain will automatically create matching publicprivate keys, but its not doing it for me.  I am totally stumped and I dont know what I can do at this point.  Please help.  Heres what Ive done so farp  p1  I revoked the certificates from Apple Developer  iOS Provisioning Portal  Certificates  Developer and Distribution tabs.p  p2  I launched Keychain Access.app from Applications  Utilities.p  p3  I removed all outdated certificates, and eventually removed everything except for Apple Code Signing Certification Authority, Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority, Dashboard Advisory and Software Signing.  By the way, I have no idea what this Software Signing certificate is for, but it wont be expiring until 2015, Im reluctant to delete it without knowing what it would do to the system if I deleted it.p  p4  I generated CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access  Certificate Assistant  Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authorityp  p5  Got the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest on desktop.  At this point, I check the Keychain, and I still dont see my private or public keys.p  p6  I submit the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest at Apple Developer  iOS Provisioning Portal  Certificates  Developer and Distribution tabs.p  p7  I download the certificates, install them to keychain, and it looks like my certificates are now renewed for another year.p  p8  I renew all provisioning profiles.p  p9  I retrieve them to my Xcode.p  p10  I generate new distribution build, then I get the warning that Application failed codesign verification.  The signature was invalid, contains disallowed entitlements, or it was not signed with an iPhone Distribution Certificate.p  p11  I look at the Keychain again, and I dont see my private or public keys. p  p12  Well, I exported p12 file a year ago.  So, okay, I start all over again i.e., take the steps 1, 2 and 3.  Then I import the p12 file.  Now I see my private key in my Keychain.p  p13  I then resume with step 4 above i.e., get the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access  Certificate Assistant  Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authorityp  p14  I continue on with steps 5 through 8.  Just to make sure, I reboot my machine again.  Then I check my Keychain, and public key is still missing, and taking steps 9 and 10 results exactly the same.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  What should I do to fix this problem  Id so appreciate any and all help.p  hr  pEDIT  Im not entirely sure which steps I took actually ended up fixing this, but I got it working now. Main thing was, deleting everything from keychain and look for possible cause all over the web, and and I did read this thread toop  pa hrefhttphints.macworld.comarticle.phpstory20060318124936642 relnofollowhttphints.macworld.comarticle.phpstory20060318124936642ap  pAnd run these commandsp  psudo systemkeychain vfcCp  psystemkeychain vtp  pI also continued to look for how to repair keychain, run disk utility, repairing any and all permission issues, etc.p  pAnd eventually, my keychain access app started working as expected again, and it finally generated both private and public keys.  Ahhhh.  Once it did that, everything else worked fine, doing the steps I took earlier.p

Negative 5310 pIn my java application I am using equal objects multiple times at different places. That means the equals method returns true, when comparing theses objects. Now I want to update one object and make the changes to all objects that are equal. Do you know if there is a pattern for thatp  pMy concrete use case is I am using JSF, JPA and CDI. A user is on web page that allows him to edit the detached entity EntityA. The page is sessionscoped. EntityA has two references to an EntityB also detached. These objects can be same. Not the same reference, but they may be equal.p  precodeEntity public class EntityA     OneToOne    private EntityB entity1    OneToOne    private EntityB entity2  codepre  pThe JSF view lets the uses select entity1 and entity2 from a selection list. It also shows some details of theses EntityBs and the user is allowed to edit entity1 and entity2 seperately. Everything works fine, except the user has choses the same equal EntityB for entity1 and entity2. Then, only the references to these objects are updated. Of course entity1 and entity2 are two different JPA entites, and are not the same reference. But I want to distribute the changes to all detached instances of EntityB. I have this situation hundreds of times in my application, so I dont want to take care about, which objects have to be updated in which situations. I need some solutation the does it for me automatically. One Idea was to keep all objects I use in this session in special list and every time a request was submitted and processed iterate over this map and change alle equal objects. But his sounds very dirty. Maybe there is a build in JPA function to make all equal objects the same reference. I dont know if this is possible. Do you have a solution for this Thanks.p

Negative 5310 pGiven a large amount of vertices and edges. The vertices are given x and y coordinates and every edge will have two vertices.p  pFor zooming, the easy solution is to just draw all the edges that have a vertex in the given x and y coordinate, that the screen is zoomed in on, instead of drawing every single edge on the map. But how will I draw the edges that just run through the area that I am zoomed in on p  pThe only solution I can come up with is to linearly go through every edge and calculate whether the edge will enter the area I am zoomed in on, by finding the x and y coordinate for each end of the edge. Does anyone have a sneaky solution to thisp  pAlso, regarding panning, would the best solution not be to load 8 boxes around the area, that the user sees, with the same sizep  pEDIT  I forgot to say, the different edges have information in them, so according to each zoom level, different types of edges will be drawn, which is why I prefer to make my own zoom.p

Negative 5310 pstrongProblemstrong I am developing a graphical front end for a distributed CPUGPU simulator. As this simulator utilizes MPI, it requires a hostfile detailing the hostnames for all computers being used on the network so that it knows what machines to distribute across. As the end users for my application are not computer scientists and may not even be very computer literate, I cant expect them to knowfind the hostnames of every computer on their networkcluster. I would like to programmatically perform this hostname discovery so that, upon application startup, the user can see the available machines, and from those, pick the hosts they want to run on. If possible, I would like this solution to be cross platform but as the simulator currently contains some linux dependencies I can deal with a Linux only solution.p  pstrongWhat I have tried so farstrong I tried utilizing the nmap package to discover hosts on a network with commands like codenmap sP ltip address rangegtcode using the ip address range for that local network. However, it only dumps the IP addresses for the hosts not the host names and strongIm not sure how to translate these IP addresses into ssh hostnamesstrong as MPI uses ssh for  host discovery. Additionally, I used a similar approach with ping supplying the broadcast address and it returned nearly identical results.p  pI apologize for the broad nature of this question and the lack of code shown but I am not very experienced with network probing  programming and I am really not even sure where to start. I tried googling this but I was unable to find a suitable option possibly because my lack of experience caused me to use improper terminology triggering improper results My background is primarily in graphics and user interface programming, so this is a little beyond my comfort zone. p

Negative 5310 pI setup a subscription in a SQL Server 2012 SP1 Reporting Services instance that exports a 34MB file to the Excel 20072013 XLSX OpenXML render extension.

This does not help since only one subscription is running at the time of the error.pli lipA recommendation to use the Excel 2003 render method and break the rows into separate tabs to avoid the 65,536 row limit.  I did verify this works, but this was not an acceptable solution from the business stakeholders perspective.pli lipA comment indicating any report using the Excel 20072013 render method that exceeds 10 MB in size switches from being generated in memory to using Isolated Storage.  Theres no explanation why this is bad and I assume this was done for a good reason  perhaps to limit RAM consumption.pli lipA suggestion to elevate permissions for users in the Isolated Storage folder for the ASP.NET application.  I could not find where the Isolated Storage folder is located for Reporting Services.pli lipA suggestion to wrap the ASP.NETs code for Isolated Storage with extra code that bypasses this problem.  I couldnt find a way to apply this solution to Reporting Services since this is a shipped product from Microsoft.pli lipA suggestion to modify the Report Manager and Report Server web.config files to include maxRequestLength200000 in the httpRuntime node.  This did not change the results.pli lipA suggestion to increase memory settings explicitly in RSReportServer.config.  This didnt seem like it would help since the error relates to Isolated Storage, but I tried it out of desparation.

Negative 5310 pIm looking for a design pattern to solve an architectual issue Im having.p  pI use some webservices that are emkindaem the same but not exactly. For each new version of the webservices there might be a few more methods available, but for the most part they are basically the same.p  pI want to write an abstractionlayer that works regardless of which version of the webservices Im communicating with. Obviously if Im using a method that only exists in the newer versions of the webservices I will get some sort of error, but that is OK. I can handle those.p  pThe reason I want this abstraction layer is to avoid a tight coupling between my application and the version of the webservices it is communicating with.p  pWhat are my options when it comes to design patterns for my abstraction layer I see there is one pattern called Adapter, and another one called Bridge. Will any of those do in this situation Any help is appreciatedp  pEdit  for clarity here is a drawing. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdcx8j.png altenter image description herep  pSometimes I want my application to talk to webservices version 1, and other times I want it to use webservices version 2.

The only exception is that if it uses a method that is only available in some of the versions I need to handle that gracefully tell the user that they have installed an old version of the webservices.p

Negative 5310 pI want to have an Imprint in my app with information such as the apps version number, its logo, an email address, etc. but Im not sure where should it be placed and how.p  pIn the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comdesignpatternshelp.html relnofollowdesign Help docs from Androida seems like the right place is there, in the Help section of the action overflow but in most of the apps that I have, this kind of information usually falls into the Settings section. In my case, I wont have a Help section, so I thought about having my Imprint in the Settings, but then, how do I implement it It seems to me that the Settings are meant to... yeah, change the behavior of the app and therefore all the classes of the Preference package CheckBoxPreference, SwitchPreference, etc. go on that direction and are not meant to just present information. Should I use something like a DialogPreference, for example or there are better ways of doing thisp

The step that I am currently on is transforming stackbased IL to registerbased IL. I was thinking I could walk the stackbased IL and carry along the current eval stack similar to .NETs eval stack.

This updated stack would be passed into the next opcodes emit cycle.p  pNote that I am very new to functional programming I learned of it a week ago, coming from a C background, and my primary question is what is the functional way to do thisp  pHeres my best guess of what a functional approach to this would be psudocode.

Negative 5310 pIm looking for a faster and trickier way to multiply two 4x4 matrices in C. My current research is focused on x8664 assembly with SIMD extensions. So far, Ive created a function witch is about 6x faster than a naive C implementation, which has exceeded my expectations for the performance improvement. Unfortunately, this stays true only when no optimization flags are used for compilation GCC 4.7. With codeO2code, C becomes faster and my effort becomes meaningless.p  pI know that modern compilers make use of complex optimization techniques to achieve an almost perfect code, usually faster than an ingenious piece of handcrafed assembly.

Negative 5310 plets start this thread with a bunch of assumptionsbr first assumption we have a library .dll which contains the following code  p  precodeclass Program      static void Mainstring[] args          XmlSerializer ser  new XmlSerializertypeofFoo        public class Foo  public string name codepre  psecond assumption we got a class that derives from Foo, lets call it Bar.p  precodepublic class Bar  Foo   codepre  pThis class is located outside the library. p  pNow comes the magic into it the Barclass is loaded via Reflection so we do not know of its existence during compiletime. Also the codeXmlSerializercode does not know anything of the derived class and because we are in a completely different library we cannot simply add codeXmlIncludecode here because we cannot change the code of the codeFoocodeclass. So is there any way to use the existing codeXmlSerializercode on an instance of the codeBarcodeclass I know that by the current implementation codesercode wouldnt be visible at all to any outer code, but lets take this aside and assume that we CAN access the serializer from within the codeBarcodeclass p  pCan this furthermore be achieved by using attributes to the codeBarcodeclass [System.Xml.Serialization...] in front of the class definition p

From my understanding, you can look at Frequency like points on a map and likewise, cents like the distance in between those points. That being said, how can cents determine the frequency of the note since the sound is being generated directly from the browser  Also, if  its as simple as just moving the pitch of the Oscillator, what note does the oscillators start on In other words, what note are you pitching per sayp  pI hope what I wrote makes sense considering Im pretty confused myself.p  pThanks for any help and feedbackp

Negative 5310 pI am attempting to implement a Windows Forms control in C that resembles a textbox.  When the user types 3 or more characters, a search will be performed against a datasource.

Negative 5310 pI have a documentbased application which has two document types.  The first codeNSDocumentcode subclass is the main document mainDoc and its code.xibcode file is the main editing window for the application.  The second codeNSDocumentcode class is a data source file dataDoc, a set of these is kept in the users Application Support folder and the set or a subset is opened to be used by mainDoc windows. The dataDoc files can be edited and this is done in their own window from their own .xib file.p  pOpening dataDocs without making their windows is straight forward with codeopenDocumentWithContentsOfURLdisplaycompletionHandlercode however, keeping them open after they have been edited i.e their only codeNSWindowControllercode is closed is not.  I created an codeNSWindowControllercode subclass thinking this would help.  However overriding codeshouldCloseDocumentcode does not help because the document is closed regardless of my wishes if its last codeNSWindowControllercode is closed as specified in the Apple documentation.p  pHow can a close I documents windows but keep the document open  Have I missed something obviousp  pOne possibility I have though of is to add the mainDocs windowcontroller to the windowcontrollers for all of the open dataDocs.  Is this the best solution  It seems inelegant and requires a bit of stuffing around.p  pAnother possibility is to reopen the dataDoc after it is closed each time, but that is even less elegant and I see it as a last resort.p  pThank you for any helpp

Negative 5310 pI have a Windows Service application written in C which performs a number of tasks in the background. As a sidefeature, the application offers interfaces for UI clients to connect to currently a WPF client application. This is mainly WCF Data Services OData and WCF services for now, but may also include serving web pages through embedding ASP.NET so a browser could be used to access the service. p  pAll of this works pretty well, with selfhosted services through ServiceHostWSHttpBinding and DataServiceHostWebHttpBinding, which is all setup in code since it is somewhat dynamicflexible.p  pNow I started to look into authentication and worked myself through setting up a basic authentication with a custom namepassword validator through MessageCredentialType.UserName, UserNamePasswordValidationMode.Custom, etc. Now clients need to provide correct usernamepassword which is validated against an application specific user list. This also works well, with something likep  precodewebHttpBinding  new WebHttpBindingWebHttpSecurityMode.TransportCredentialOnly webHttpBinding.Security.Transport.ClientCredentialType  HttpClientCredentialType.Basic  serviceHost.Credentials.UserNameAuthentication.UserNamePasswordValidationMode  UserNamePasswordValidationMode.Custom serviceHost.Credentials.UserNameAuthentication.CustomUserNamePasswordValidator  new UserRepositoryPasswordValidator  UserRepository  UserRepository   serviceHost.Authorization.PrincipalPermissionMode  PrincipalPermissionMode.Custom codepre  pHowever, as I understand, without any kind of transport security, usernamepassword as well as any data is being transmitted in plain text between client ans service, which is not desirable. I have therefore tried to find a way to use a securedencrypted communication. This sounds like sslhttps would be the way to go. p  pI went through a number of articles to find out how to do this, but find the approach overly complicated and confusing. My application obviously does not use IIS or another web server, so many articles and posts do not seem to apply to my scenario.  Also, the application in question should be deployedinstalled onto different target machines and just run without the need to tweak any operating system aspects. I was highly confused to see that using sslhttps requires to run netsh commands to register the certificate with the port, etc. Why is this so complicatedp  pI can accept that the certificate used for sslhttps would not be a highly trusted one, since it would be impractical to create a new certificate for every target machine my software gets installed on most of which I do not even control or ever see. p  pDoes anyone have instructions about a good acceptable strategy to get my current C Windows Service with selfhosted WCFWCF Data Services to use sslhttps without too much trouble and without complicating the installation process of my appp  pJ.p

Negative 5310 pIm currently developing CSV export with XSLT. And CSV file will be used 99 percent with Excel in my case, so I have to consider Excel behavior. p  pMy first problem was German special characters in csv. Even fact that CSV encoding is UTF8, Excel cannot open properly CSV file with UTF8. The special characters are getting weird symbols. I found a solution for this problem. I just added 3 additional bytesema hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiByteordermarkstrongEF BB BFstronga  a.k.a BOM Headerem beginning of content bytes. Because UTF8 BOM is way to say that hey dude, it is UTF8, open it properly to Excel. Problem solvedp  pAnd my second problem was about separator. The default separator could be comma or semicolon depending on region. I think it is semicolon in Germany and comma in UK. So, in order to prevent this problem, I had to add the line in belowp  precodeltxsltextgtsepltxsltextgt codepre  porp  precodeltxsltextgtsep,ltxsltextgt codepre  pThis separator was not implemented as hardcodedp  pBut my problem which I cannot find any solution is that if you add sep or sep, beginning of the file while the CSV file is being generated with UT8BOM, the BOM doesnt help for showing special characters properly anymore And Im sure that BOM bytes are always in the beginning of byte array.

Negative 5310 pI am using 3rd party services which can logged user and then remembers him until he logged out. I am not sure how they do that.

I can switch to Spring 3, if it matters. I just took the Spring dependencies from another project.p  pWhat I have triedp  ul liTo search from Google whether I have a missing Maven dependency. Class org.hibernate.dialect seems to be provided by Hibernate, and I have hibernatecore in my pom.xml. I tried to add hibernateentitymanager, hibernatetools, etc. to pom.xml in hope that one of them provides the necessary dependency, but it did not help.li liI thought maybe I need to add PostgreSQL driver, so I added 9.19011.jdbc4 to pom.xml see below. It did not have an effect.li liI tried to see if Eclipse can resolve class org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect, and indeed, it can. I took random project file and created entity field of PostgreSQLDialect and CTRLclicked on the field, and I was taken to source code of class org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect. But I still get errors when I try to run the project on server.li liI tried to inspect Maven depencency tree, as instructed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17495802invocationofinitmethodfailednestedexceptionisorghibernatehibernateexcherea.

Negative 5310 pI have set a ip camera security system in my house using a Cubieboard running Lubuntu 12.04, and some of my cameras are getting poor wifi signal. This way, since I have a constant stream from the camera to the Cubieboard, whe I try to access the camera remotelly the connection gets really bad.p  pThe sollution I came up is having the Cubieboard to receive a stream from the camera and, using VLC, I restream it. This way the recording system that runs on the Cubie itself get a strem from VLC and the remote access from wherever I am gets tht VLC stream also, not overloading the wifi connection between the camera and the router.p  pI get this stream by using the following commandp  precodehttpuserpasswordcamIpcamPortvideostream.cgi codepre  pThis gives me a MJPEG stream that I restream like thisp  precodecvlc httpuserpasswordcamIpcamPortvideostream.cgi sout standardaccesshttp,muxts,dst8888 codepre  pNow I want to use a html to display all my cameras in kiosk mode using some browser.

It would be nice if I could find a way to do it without having to transcode the stream, in order to save the cubies limited processing power.p  pAny help will be very much appreciatedp

Negative 5310 pI am learning Rails with the a hrefhttpruby.railstutorial.org relnofollowRails Tutoriala. The author actively teaches selective bits of RSpec. In exercises after each chapter, you have the opportunity to learn to write pithier code. I have chosen to do those exercises. But, the problem is, in the following chapters, he treats the reader as if they didnt, so the pithier code you wrote lends itself to challenges when you dont know how to adapt the new unpithy code he writes to its pithier counterpart.p  pIn the pithy version, the beginning of the file lends itself to less repetition, and looks as suchp  precoderequire spechelper    describe User do      before  user  User.newname Example User, email userexample.com,                               password foobar, passwordconfirmation foobar       subject  user       it  should respondtoname      it  should respondtoemail      it  should respondtopassworddigest      it  should respondtopassword      it  should respondtopasswordconfirmation       it  should bevalid    .   .   . end codepre  pSo, then our tests look like sop  precode  describe when email is not present do     before  user.email         it  shouldnot bevalid    end codepre  pWhen attempting to create a test for whether or not the codeuser.passwordcode and codeuser.passwordconfirmationcode are present, I am looking to continue this RSpec format.p  pThe authors version looks as suchp  precodedescribe when email is not present do   before do     user User.newname Example User, email userexample.com,                     password  , passwordconfirmation      end   it  shouldnot bevalid  end codepre  pMy attempt at it since the author reverts to the method of doing things without the exercise of pithier RSpec code would be as suchp  precodedescribe when password is not present do   before  user.password   , user.passwordconfirmation       it  shouldnot bevalid  end codepre  pIs this the proper way to modify multiple hash values using a before in this context p  pFurthermore, I am struggling to locate answers for my RSpec questions.

Negative 5310 pI have to add a method to an interface. So I just added it in my java interface and the developed the algorithm in the class that implements that interface. So far so good. However it turns out that when I run my application I get one exception when running this method.p  pSo, I decided to do one trick just to check that the problem had nothing to do with the logic inside my method. I duplicated one of the methods already existing in my interface and changed the name, and then I did the same thing in the class implementing my interface.

Negative 5310 pI have two inputs, both use the same field in the database. The difference between them is simple, one is just text input while the other makes it possible for the user to pick something from dropdown list. Might look like thisp  precode f.input age, label gt false, inputhtml class textfield  f.input age, label gt false, inputhtml class dropdown, collection [1,2,3] codepre  pin this case, only the second input will send information.  My question is How can I prevent input from sending anything WITHOUT removing it from HTML my purpose is to enable user pick option custom age which will enable them to fill the field with, well, custom value. tricky part is both input must be there all the timep

At first I had a hard time guessing what does it mean but, I think its because of my codeuniqueidentifiercode is not generating random id. p  pWhat to dop  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is my SQL table structurep  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[UserCredential]     [UserCredentialId] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,     [UserRoleId] [int] NOT NULL,     [Username] [varchar]25 NOT NULL,     [Password] [varchar]50 NOT NULL,     [PasswordSalt] [varchar]max NOT NULL,     [FirstName] [varchar]50 NOT NULL,     [LastName] [varchar]50 NOT NULL,     [PayorCode] [varchar]20 NOT NULL,     [ProviderCode] [varchar]50 NULL,     [CorporationCode] [varchar]50 NULL,     [Department] [varchar]50 NULL,     [Status] [varchar]1 NOT NULL,     [DateCreated] [datetime] NOT NULL,     [DateActivated] [datetime] NULL,     [Deactivated] [datetime] NULL,     [DateUpdated] [datetime] NULL,     [CreatedBy] [varchar]50 NOT NULL,     [UpdatedBy] [varchar]50 NOT NULL,     [EmailAddress] [varchar]50 NULL,     [ContactNumber] [int] NULL,     [Picture] [varbinary]max NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKUserCredential1] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [UserCredentialId] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pI already set it to codenewidcode but still not working.p
Negative 5310 pI have, a problem with the setLookAtM function. My goal is to create a cube within a cube something like this yep, its paint P p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comujDb0.png altenter image description herep  pSo basically everything works... almoust... I have the smaller cube and I have the bigger one. However, there is a problem. I created the bigger one with coords from 1 to 1 and now I want to upscale it. With scale 1.0f i have something like this the inner cube is rotatingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVmCor.jpg altenter image description herep  pAnd thats good, but now... when I try to scale the bigger cube so that it looks like in the paint drawing the image goes black or white i guess its because the camera looks at the white cube but still i dont know why does my inner cube disappear  I dont understand what Im doing wrong.

Negative 5310 pI implemented and exposed REST API on my server. Now I need to expose same API, but I cant use REST its actually websocket messages, it will be some custom format. Dont ask why p  pI imagine message transformation from my custom format to http request, then process it in my webserver, transform response back to my custom format, and send to client.p  pThe simplest way is regular http call to localhost. For example javap  precodeHttpURLConnection con  HttpURLConnection new URLhttplocalhostapi....openConnection codepre  pand so on, or using some http client library. But Im afraid there will be too much overhead, creating connection, etc.p  pAnother waysp  ol liI use Tomcat. Push my request directly to tomcat somehow.li liI use Guice, and all requests go through GuiceFilter. Craft ServetRequest, ServletResponce and FilterChain objects and directly call GuiceFilter.doFilter.li liI use GuiceContainer for Jersey. Some test frameworks use it for REST API testing, but also need to craft requestresponse objects.li ol  pThere is no standard way to craft request object at all. And I dont know on which level its better to add my custom requests.p  pHope I described my problem clearly.p

Negative 5310 pI have a lot of unit tests in Django and if a test fails, I often need to see the logs in the console if possible. I cant really use the log file because it gets really messy when unit testing.br What I do right now is active console logging in the settings.py, and only run this specific test. I was hoping that there is a more convenient way to do so. I only want to see what was being logged for the failing tests and not the complete log.p  pstrongEditstrong event though an awnser was made  and I have accepted it  Im not quite content. I want to see only the logging output of failing tests. I was looking for a solution that like PHPUnit provides. It captures the complete output for logging  print and only writes it to stdout if the test fails. p

Negative 5310 pI want to start learning C but it becomes really irritating when you have to wait up to 3 minutes for a simple two line program to build and run. Ive tried multiple things like completely disabling build logging, disabling generate scanner info command inside the discovery options and something else sorry I cannot remember. p  pAnother thing is that sometimes its the build that takes a long time, and other times its the actual opening of the [filename].exe It hits 70 on the progression bar then will just stop for a minute, sometimes I try pressing the run button again and it ends up executing the program twice. p  pIts not completely necessary that I get this fixed but it would be a big help.

Negative 5310 pSince Im using PostgreSQL there is a module which is called a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.4staticltree.html relnofollowltreea, which satisfies at least one of my needs, performance I dont know about scalability Someone says materialized path trees does not scale well...p  pSince the application Im developing is a CMS built entirely around a big tree, nodes, subtrees etc performance in queuering these nodes is absolutely essential, but since its a hiearchical large as it grows tree youre working on and manipulating from the GUI CRUD, I also want to make it possible for users to drag and drop to reorder nodes, subtrees etc while updating the tree child records in the database correctly.p  pAs I understand moving and reordering nodessubtrees in a tree is not really what ltreematerialized path trees are good for, so what I hope you can help be with is to either point me to the correct treestructuremodel that is best for performance AND moving subtrees and nodes, or perhaps... if ltree is indeed not a leftover from the past but worth still using, how could you achieve this with PostgreSQLs ltree module And whywhy not use ltree in this casep  pRequirementsp  ol liQuery performance is of course my top priority all nodes, subtrees, leafs.li liThe tree should support deep level nesting, and sortingli liAnd of course the tree should have support for growing large and scaling bigli liI can live with a little waiting time while reordering from the GUI, if 1 jackofalltrades tree implementation doesnt exist, or is too complex for being worth it.li ol  pIm also considering the Closure tables aka Bridge tables alot, Nested Intervals not sure I understand exactly how to implement it, and no good examples or gists currently exists or Btree models. Im just not quite sure yet, how these will satisfy my above 4 requirements. Reorganizing subtrees and nodes in nested intervals seems straightforward and performance seems good.. Quite hard to choose the right one to go with.p  pSince I definitely need performance query  read performance, scalability, sorting I kinda thought that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma140743103973406Closure tables WITH sort ordera could be very close, but I just cant imagine how big the closure tables and diskspaceoverhead will become as my tree and nodes grow large. Closure tables and scalability, Im just not too sure of. Am I wrong in worrying about this, and what might the best solution for this task bep

Negative 5310 pGood afternoon,p  pI have a string of binary characters, that gets displayed as spaces and arbitrary characters when viewed in the watch window.

Negative 5310 pIm writing a REST connector to HP Quality Center using Apache CFX. Id like to use the CFX infrastructure to do preemptive authentication when a request is made to the serverp  pHP Quality Center uses an Authentication mechanism based on Basic. To authenticate, a get request is sent to httpqcbinauthenticationpointauthenticate with a standard Basic authentication header. The server then returns a cookie LWSSO which must be included in all subsequent requests. Requesting a resource from the server before authenticating will result in a 401 with WWWAuthenticate header that contains the authentication point URI e.g. LWSSO realmhttp80qcbinauthenticationpoint.p  pIdeally, Id like to create a CFX HttpAuthProvider or Interceptor that handles authentication by intercepting a 401 response, parsing out the WWWAuthenticate header and performing the request on the authentication point URI before caching the cookie for all subsequent requests.p  pThis would allow me to create a clean Proxy based API using a factory pattern. For examplep  precodepublic QualityCenter createString url, String username, String password      JAXRSClientFactoryBean bean  new JAXRSClientFactoryBean     bean.setAddressurl     bean.setUsernameusername     bean.setPasswordpassword     bean.setServiceClassQualityCenter.class                TODO Setup authentication modules here that use AuthPolicy for credentials.      return bean.createQualityCenter.class  codepre  pI just cant seem to figure out if this is possible and where best to implement the functionality.p

However, this software also uses springdata JPA repositories, which uses the Spring codeTransactionalcode annotation. Since we discovered this, we switched to using Spring codeTransactionalcode annotation on all newer business code.p  pMy questions are p  ul liDoes using both different annotation cause any kind of problem  Im guessing not because we discovered the problem during a code refactoring but we didnt notice any defect related to this problem. However, I prefer to be sureli liWhats the difference in behavior between the two annotations li ul  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5310 pI got a query while developing rest service.p  pAs per the REST design, GET is to read , PUT or POST are to create or update based on scenario , DELETE is to delete the resources.p  pBut technically, Cant we perform a create or delete operation in GET call. i.e. It is up to client way of calling by using specified URL pattern and required response type to hit the exact method in the service class of REST application. But why cant we perform a delete or create of some data in the GET service.p  pso my question is the DELETE or CREATE technically not possible in GET service or is it a rule to adhere to REST principles.p

Negative 5310 pI am given a binary matrix in Matlab and I am interested in finding grid structures in this binary matrix. p  pFor example, consider this chessboard binary matrixp  precodeX  zeros11,20 indeces  12220 Xindeces  1 imshowX codepre  pIn this case the result would be two subgrids given by p  precodex  1120 y  1111 [X,Y]  meshgridx,y   First subgrid X1   modX  1,2  0 amp modY  1,2  0 imshowX1   Second subgrid X2  modX,2  0 amp modY,2  0 imshowX2 codepre  pOf course, this is an easy example, usually codeXcode would be a lot less regular. I could provide a maximum step size for the grid to find. p  pEDIT To make this precise A stronggrid Gstrong is a binary matrix defined by the following parameters  the total size codesizeGcode, an upper left corner code[x0,y0]code, a spacing codescode between the grids points and the number of points in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively, codenumX, numYcode.

For exemple we have a page where we render a post with his comments.p  ul liIn one hand we can load the comment in the controller that shows the post and pass it as an argument to a twig macro to rendre the list of commentsli liin the other hand we can create a controller that take the post as an argument  and render it the twig that shows the post li ul  pWhich one is the best approche i am using symfony2p

Negative 5310 pI am starting to write a little engine for using OpenCL. Now, I encountered a problem that is quite strange.p  pWhen I call codeclGetDeviceInfocode to query informations of the specific device, some of the options for the parameter codeparamnamecode return the error code 30   CLINVALIDVALUE.

I checked every edge and also the parameters are double checked.p  pAnother thing I do not understand is when I run my source on my Windows machine at work, the codeclGetPlatformInfocode function also returns me CLINVALIDVALUE querying the CLPLATFORMEXTENSIONS string.

Negative 5310 pIn Postgres 9.3.6, truncates against a table with lt10 rows in it are regularly taking 23 minutes.p  pThe truncate is stuck in waitingf and stateidle in transaction for the duration of the delay.p  pResearching this online, the standard answer to this problem is lock contention, but that doesnt appear to be the case here.  This is happening on a CI host that is unloaded except for the CI tests.  According to pgstatactivity, the truncate is the only statement running, and according to pglocks there are no locks that have not been granted, so it doesnt appear to me that the truncate is being blocked waiting for a lock.p  pAdditionally, Ive checked the postgres log for deadlock errors and have found none.p  pNote that we are using a truncate vs. 10 rows because this problem is happening during CI testing  during normal production operation there are 106ish rows in this table, so truncation makes sense.

Negative 5310 pstrongBackgroundstrong I am developing a scheduler for a system in strongService Oriented Architecture emSOAemstrong with a framework similar to strongInternet Communications EngineemICEemstrong .p  pServices in the system run on multiple machines depending on their workloads. For example, service A will run on 10 machines when workload is 1000second and on 100 machines when workload is 10000second.p  pIn the system, one service calls other services, too. As a result, the response time of service A not only depends on workload on every machine, but also depends on response times of service B,C,D which are called by service A. If service B goes wrong, service A goes wrong, too.  When the servicecalling network is complicated, a lot of service go wrong when one service starts to go wrong. It is hard to determine which service should have more machines. p  pBecause of system performance reasons, we cannot have a whole picture of all services when scheduling. As a result, we need to make decision based on local information of service A.p  pstrongThe questionstrong is can we model service A to predict performance of service A given circumstances of service A current workload of service A, current performance of service B, C, D and current resource utilization on the machines. p  pstrongPurposestrong we can use the model to find which factor causes the performance degradation of service A Performance degradation of service BCD or resource limitation.p  pstrongGivenstrong Training data can be historical performance average response time, workload of service A, B, C, D and resource utilization on machines where service A runs. p

Negative 5310 pSo Im programming a website using WordPress. Right now I have a news feed that I can just create simple stories and put a link in them and everything is great, working as intended I suppose.p  pBut right now I must click on the news story to see the whole story and only then I can see the link. What I want to do is when I see the News overview, I want a link to appear.p  pSimilar on facebook if you post a link while making a status, the link will always appear and you dont have to press Read More to see see the link.p  pI want this but not so fancy.p  pTLDR I want a URL to appear in the news story summary when a link is attached to the story.p

Negative 5310 pI currently have all of my key press code in my various SKScene classes. I only want something to happen every time the key is pressed. The key needs to be retriggered to perform the action again. Im using a boolean array to keep track of this. This may not be optimal, but its what I thought of at the time. I was looking to create a class to manage all of this, but key event methods keyUp and keyDown are created in SKScene classes. Is there a global way to handle keys presses so that I dont have to recreate this code in every scene in my gamep

Negative 5310 pWe have a issue with XMLExternalentityinjection in application developed using jboss seam framework 2.1.0 There is a ajax call in application from where attacker appends Doctype tag to request xml to introduce the XMLExternalentityinjection.

So need to write a custom filter where it will interpret all the requests and remove the doctype tag from xml which is stored in the request object and send the filtered XML to seam framework.

I know the following will work if all lines have a zero data entry.p  precodesed inplace gt0.00ltd FILENAME  codepre  pHowever, if I have the second example below, this will leave me with p  precodeltcgt1.00ltcgt codepre  pwhich isnt what Im looking for. I know I probably need an if statement, something likep  precodeif all lines contain the string gt0.00lt then    sed inplace gt0.00ltd FILENAME  fi codepre  pI suppose its the condition in the if statement that im not sure about. How would I go about stating if all lines contain the above mentioned string I dont necessarily have to use sed, I have used awk in the past, but I am most comfortable with sed.... Any input or pointers in the right direction would be most appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 5310 pI have a Java socket server using Netty that works fine with SSLTLS and a Java Netty client, but Im having difficulty getting a Unity C client to consistently complete the handshake. Two or three times a day it will work, although my copious logging does complain about the server certificate RemoteCertificateNotAvailable the few times that it works. I have added the selfsigned cert that the server uses to the Windows trusted certs, and have also added it using my C code to the Mono store, reading the cert from a file.  Im not getting any error messages in the Unity logs, just the logging line before I call AuthenticateAsClient, then Unity Editor stops responding and I have to use Windows Task Manager to kill it after Im sure it wont complete.  When it does complete it proceeds quickly.  The build platform is PC executable, not a web player, and Im using Unity 4.6.6f2 and Ive already checked that Im not using the .NET subset, but rather the full .NET that Unity has. p  pI have enabled low level SSL logging on the server, which shows that it hangs after sending the WRITE TLSv1 Handshake bytes, and it does not trigger my RemoteCertificateValidationCallback. I havent figured out how to enable similar logging on the client.
