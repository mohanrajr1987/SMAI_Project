Positive 12193 pIve run into an issue with a dual language site that I cant find that answer to in any other questions.  So, I have wired up a form and display system that relies heavily on the verbose names given to each model.  The verbose name is translated, so the idea is that everything would work from that base.  So, for example, I have a model in my productsmodels.pyp  precodefrom django.utils.translation import ugettextlazy as   class ProductTypemodels.Model     description  models.CharFieldmaxlength250     ...      class Meta         verbosename  rn Tipi         verbosenameplural  rn Tipleri codepre  pFrom there, I create classbased forms and views.  Then, I create the urls by importing the views and looping through them in urls.py I will just focus on one url for this examplep  precodefrom django.conf.urls import patterns, url from .views import editingviews  editingpatterns  [] for view in editingviews     listview  view[list]     slug  slugifylistview.model.meta.verbosename     editingpatterns.append         urlr0list.formatslug, listview.asview, name0list.formatslug          ...  urlpatterns  patternsproducts.views,     editingpatterns  codepre  pAs you can see, the url and url name are both coming from the slugified version of the models verbose name, which is translated.  When the site is set to English, everything works fine.  But when it is set to Turkish, the system is not finding the translated urlsp  precodeReverse for uruntipilist with arguments  and keyword arguments  not found. 0 patterns tried [] codepre  pNow the strange part is that when I import the url patterns from this file into the django shell, I always get the Turkish names, regardless of what language the site is set top  precodeltRegexURLPattern uruntipilist uruntipilistgt codepre  pNow, perhaps this is just some wonkiness with the Django shell, but I also printed the patterns to the console at the end of the urls.py file, and the main problem seems to be that the urls in runtime are in English, regardless of what the site is set top  precodeproducttypelist codepre  pBut obviously the verbosename translation is working, because that is where we are getting the uruntipilist getting printed in the  url  tag of the template where its not being found.  p  pIll throw in some more general information about the internationalization setup in case it is helpful.p  pin settings.pyp  precodeTEMPLATECONTEXTPROCESSORS   ... django.core.contextprocessors.i18n, ...

When changing the page the new entries are loaded via ajax.p  pServer sided I create a simple SQLSelect to retrieve the data. The i18n file is not used here.p  pThe Framework does provide a method to map the values from the i18nFile. In this example the values from the column Value are mapped to the entries of the i18n File.

The different way is to pass the returning value of operator by valuep  precodeMatrix operatorMatrixamp m Matrixamp operatorMatrixamp m codepre  pThe operator instantiates codereturncode on the stack, set the values and then return the object.p  pThere is a problem with this approach it doesnt work. The operator expects a Matrixamp and operator returns a Matrix. Moreover this approach doesnt look so good to me for another reason Im dealing with matrices, that can be very large and the aims of this library were to be 1 good enough for my project 2 fast, so probably passing by value should not be an option.p  pstrongWhich solutions I have exploredstrongp  pWell, following the suggestions in the previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions475888willthisleadtoamemoryleakincdiscussiona I read some stuff about smart pointers, they look great but I cant still figure out how to solve my problem with them. They deal with memory freeing and pointer copying, but Im basicly using references, so they dont look the right choice for me. But I may be wrong.p  pMaybe the only solution is to pass by value, maybe I cant get both efficiency and a good interface. But again, youre the expert, and I would like to know your opinion.p

All of the controls are hierarchical in nature.  Type A contains the data thats needed to load the Type B controls and the Type B contains the data thats needed to load the Type C controls.  The Type C control has a standard ComboBox in it for changing the values of the present items.  In addition to the above structure, I have drag and dropping tied to the PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown event on both the Type A and Type B UserControl levels to handle reorderingdeletingetc commands in the GUI.  All of this is working as intended.  p  pThe Problembr  When I attempt to change the value in the ComboBox, the SelectionChanged event never fires on the Type C level unless Im careful enough to click on the bordersspacing in between any Type A or B controls.  This happens when my ComboBox popout menu overlaps on either a Type A or B control located below itself.  The selection events for Type A or B are firing instead of the Type C events, so the ComboBox is never changing its value reliably.  In the debugger, the code for handling the drag and drop is triggering on the next ListBoxItem thats located underneath the ComboBox.  p  pThoughtsbr  Is there a way I can make my ComboBox popup take prevalence over the items behind it while doublenested in a ListBox ie, ignore anything behind it while its openbr  Is there some way to reroute the incorrectly firing SelectionChanged events down to the ComboBox thats supposed to be triggering themp

Negative 12193 pI know a lot of question regarding VB6 migration have been asked, but I dont believe my exact situation has been answered in them.p  pBasically, our company is wanting to migrate our missioncritical VB6 Lineofbusiness app that is quite large, uses custom libraries to communication to other inhouse programs and some dlls we dont have access to the source.

Well, copy, pasted and changed just a tad...p  pThe decision between VB.NET and C.NET is up to us if we should attempt migration and they would like us to cater for the possibility of shifting the application to a webbased format.

Negative 12193 pIm writing a new asp.net mvc application and Ive been toying with the idea of allowing my user to post short, concise urls to content that he has posted. Those short urls will be handy in cramped spaces like Twitter and comment areas. I like this idea as Im not a huge fan of url shorteners because theyre so vague and youre never really sure what youre going to get. Instead of using a url shortener I want to give my client the ability to post p  pcodehttpdomain.comp234code p  pwhich does a 301 redirect top  pcodehttpdomain.com20090810thisisthecontenttitlecodep  pNow, this is a pretty simple process with a couple of extra routes and a custom ActionResult. The custom ActionResult I implemented is an extension method on a RedirectToRouteResult... Its fairly straightforward but about 20 lines of code nonetheless. I played around with doing the same functionality, only this time with an ActionFilter. My action filter looks likep  precodepublic class PermanentRedirectAttribute  ActionFilterAttribute      public override void OnResultExecutedResultExecutedContext filterContext              filterContext.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode  301       codepre  pand my action method looks like I removed a bunch of code to simplifyp  precode[PermanentRedirect] public ActionResult ShortUrlint id      return RedirectToActionPost, id  codepre  pMy question is this Did I miss something or is it this simple Ive found some other posts where people are looking to do something similar and they always create a custom ActionResult. Besides using less overall code, given that this behavior may need to be used elsewhere on other action methods, I dont see why it shouldnt be an ActionFilter. With that being said Im fairly new to the Request and Response objects so Im not sure if Im missing something.p

These pure virtual functions can be implemented using a template since the differences between subclasses arent large  so my idea was to use multiple inheritance to mixin the appropriately templated helperclass that provides the implementation.

You are given this code assume jQuery includedp  precodeltinput typetextgt ltscriptgt     input.valYOUR PHP  JS CODE HERE ltscriptgt codepre  pUsing jQuery  and not by injecting PHP output directly into the input tag  faithfully reproduce ANY text from the database in the input tag. If the database field says codeltscriptgtcode, the field should say that too. If has Chinese in it, double quotes, whatever, reproduce that too. Assume your PHP variable is called codetextcode.p  pHere are some of my failed attempts.p  p1p  precodeinput.vallt htmlentitiestext gt codepre  pFAILURE Reproduces character encoding exactly as is in text fields.br INPUT codetext  Dj vucodebr OUTPUT Field contains literal codedampeacutejampagrave vucodep  p2p  precodeinput.vallt jsonencodetext gt codepre  pThis was suggested as the answer in my last question, and I naively accepted it. However...br FAILURE codejsonencodecode only works with UTF8 characters.br INPUT codetext  Va e de hr f frgor egentliencodebr OUTPUT Field is blank, because codejsonencodecode returns codenullcode.p  p3p  precodevar temp  ltdivgtltdivgt.htmllt htmlentitiestext gt input.valtemp.html codepre  pThis was my most promising solution for the weird characters, except...br FAILURE Does not encode some characters not sure exactly which, dont carebr INPUT codetext  ltscriptgt Djcodebr OUTPUT Field contains codeampltscriptampgt Djcodep  p4 Suggested in answersp  precodeinput.valunescapelt urlencodetext gt codepre  pFAILURE Spaces remain encoded as s.p  precodeinput.valunescapelt rawurlencodetext gt codepre  pemAlmostem works. All previous input succeeds, but multibyte stuff, like kanji, remain encoded. codedecodeURIComponentcode also doesnt like multibyte characters.p  pNote that for me, things like codestriptagscode are not an option. Everything must be allowed. People are authoring quizzes with this, and if someone wants to make a quiz that tests your knowledge of HTML, so be it. Also, unfortunately I cannot just inject the codehtmlentitiescode escaped text into the value field of the input tags. These tags are generated dynamically, and I would have to totally tear down my current javascript code structure to do it that way.p  pI feel like Im SOL here.

Negative 12193 pWhat approach do you recommend for persisting user settings in a WPF windows desktop application   Note that the idea is that the user can change their settings at run time, and then can close down the application, then when starting up the application later the application will use the current settings.

Negative 12193 pI am trying to use this to monitor a log file and put the log lines in a database as they come in.

I can see that the TotalItemCount is correctly set.  The odd thing about this, is that the TotalItemCount property is never called by any other code except to set the value.  Shouldnt the datapager be using that to determine whether the Prev  Next  First  Last buttons can be clickedp  pstrongUpdatestrong So I looked at the DataPager while subscribing to the MouseEnter event and found something interesting.  The ItemCount is 5 and no matter what I set it to on the ViewModel for instance, setting it to 9 manually, the DataPager only looks at the items in its collection to determine how many items there actually are.  It is not reading those values from the ViewModel class.  I thought I read that if the surrounding context implements IPagedCollectionView, that the DataPager would use those methods to determine size  page etc.  p

A player also has access to the board to be able to addmoveremove units from it. A player has access to the units it owns, both on and off the board A unit also knows its owner, but that can probably be removed and just do a lookup. A board has units on it and knows units positions. Units have abilities Players possibly can as wellp  pThe big one that Im having trouble figuring out is Units Abilities. They should be able to affect anything in the game, healingdamaging a playerunit, reposition things on the board, possibly even the game itself so far there isnt a need, but it could come up.p  pHow can I have abilities that can affect anything without them having a reference to everything  I realize each ability can and should have references to only what it needs, but a unit class has abilities built in to them, so if a units ability affects the board, it will need to get a reference to the board from the unit somehowp  pIm trying to keep the design as flexible as possible, because the rules arent set in stone yet were creating a game, and still pretty early on, so its try something, see how it feels, change the rules until the game feels right  p  pEven whether theres a boardmap at all is still up in the air, so the units should be decoupled from that, which they currently are.

When the user is persisted, the associated UserPlace entities are also persisted.p  pThe problem Im experiencing is that each emPlaceem entity associated with a UserPlace is also updated. Thats not the desired effect, and Ive tried preventing the Cascade to Place from taking place pun not intended by setting Cascade to None... this doesnt change anything, however.p  pIve only managed to stop this update from taking place by specifying that each property on Place should not be updated [PropertyName].Not.Updated. This works, but its not a solution.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how I can prevent this from happeningp  pstrongEditstrong The Place entity mapping has DynamicUpdate specified as well  so the entity really shouldnt change when a user is saved.p  pPS I dont think it makes a difference to this scenario but I may be wrong, but consider this also The emPlaceem entities are loaded outside of NHibernate using ADO.NET and a stored procedure, because of some geospatial querying I couldnt do with NHibernate and then attached to the session by calling Session.Update on each entity.p

Negative 12193 pIm thinking of writing a realtime web app that would need to be able to push messages to the browser. When I first read about Comet, people seemed to consider it a brittle and immature approach due to weak browser support. Today, it seems to be an established and practical technique. But as far as I know, browers dont support the basic methods long polling, iframes and script tags any better now than they did in 06 when the idea first became popular.p  pOf course, its difficult to manage all of those connections on the server side, but Comet frameworks solve that problem and it was doable even back in 06 with something like Twisted. So whats the deal are there any dealbreaking problems with Comet support in browsers, or were the people back then just wrongp  pAlso I recently read a 2010 blog post summarizing the state of Comet technology, covering each method in detail. It made it sound like none of the methods were really viable. The post was very persuasive, which is why Im still edgy about Comet. The only thing I can remember about the blog is that it had a dark background brown or black. Has anyone else seen that post Id really like to read it again.p

Negative 12193 pI created a user account system for my website using PHP sessions and mySQL.  I have been trying for SO LONG to get it to work right.  The very first night it worked mostly right.  And I have made almost no progress since then.  Ive been researching and googling until Ive burnt out, and I havent figured it out.p  pThe problem is, I can create user accounts fine, and it registers as planned in my sql database, and I can even login correctly.  However, when I go to other pages on my site, the session doesnt seem to be registered on those pages.  I check for the users session withp  precodeif issetSESSION[username] codepre  pand if they are not logged in, a login button appears in main menu on every page.

Negative 12193 pI will have native iPhone and Android apps, and later a mobile web site for other mobile platforms all talking to a backend that manages users, settings, video, social graphs, etc. I will also have a dynamic web site with a lot of video, pictures, and social graph administration. The web site will basically be a more featureful version of the apps on the phones. The backend consists of video storage, transcoding, a video recommendation engine, options to share the video with your network.p  pMy thought is that I should build a common applications services layer that exposes a RESTful api that returns JSON, and have both the apps and the web site talk to this api. p  pMy question is should I keep the web site and the services layer both in one technology or use Java for the services layer, and Rails or Python for the web site to take advantage of their purported faster dev time. The site will have a lot of JavaScript and AJAX to support dynamic behavior. If I use Rails or Python, should they also talk RESTJSON to the services layer In terms of deployment and scaling management, it would seem like sticking with one technology like Java for all backend pieces might be better but on the other hand Rails and Python promise faster development and maintenance times for the web layer. If I use Rails for the web tier, would it make sense to deploy it in JRuby within the same JVM as the services layer to have fewer moving parts to manage on the webapp serverp  pThe site may grow to millions of users and videos. The development team are experienced at Java, with some Python, but are smart and can quickly learn other technologies. p  pFeel free to suggest the technology stack of your choice.  p

If reducing the memory footprint is the prime objective with no significant deterioration to the page rendering times as well, what would be a better optionp  ul liChanging the scope to request so that the view state is not held for too long unlike when the scope is set to session.li ul  pI read somewhere that the scope of the beans could have a bearing on the size of the view and request scoped beans may not necessarily be available for GC at the end of the request. I have seen a performance degradation in this case, straightaway though.p  ul liChanging the scope to application since a number of pages are useragnostic and dont really change based on the authenticated user. The application scope would result in a singleton and therefore, would the overall memory associated with a bean would be significantly lower as it is not tied to a user li ul  pAlso, would this result in the JSF View lingering around for a little too long If yes, this would make it worse than how it is currently with the session scoped beans.p  pLast but not the least, there are multiple forms within a view. Could this play a role as well in increasing the memory footprintp

Negative 12193 pAccording to my understanding, it does not, there are 2 ways to create an actor which is by either extending the Actor class and implementing receive or by creating an anonymous Actor using one of the actor methods. So far so good. p  pAkka has a concept of dispatchers httpakka.iodocsakka1.1.3scaladispatchers.html, so does that mean that once I create an actor and implement the receive, by default I get the event dispatcher which is similar to the react in Scala Of course, if i need to tie my actor to the thread of the OS then I would be using the thread based dispatcher, is this similar to receive in Scalap

Negative 12193 pLets say I have a document full of focusable elements, either because they are innately focusable like codeltinput typetextgtcode or because they have codetabindex0code or the like.p  pNow lets say theres a section of my document that I want to display as a modal dialog box, and I dont want the user to be distracted by anything outside the dialog box. I would like for the tab key to cycle only through focusable elements inside the container element for the dialog box. What is the simplest way to do thisp  pIf possible, I am looking for a solution that doesnt care what the contents of the dialog or the rest of the page are and doesnt try to modify them. That is, I dont want to make the elements outside of the dialog not focusable, for example. First, this requires making a reversible change and keeping track of state. Second, this requires knowing all the possible ways an element could be made focusable. This feels messy, fragile, and unscalable to me.p  pMy first attempt looks like this, but works only in the forward direction pressing Tab. It doesnt work in the reverse direction pressing ShiftTab.p  precodeltdivgtFocusable stuff outside the dialog.ltdivgt ltdiv classdialog tabindex0gt   lt Focus should be trapped inside this dialog while its open gt   ltdiv classcontentgt     Form contents and focusable stuff here.   ltdivgt   ltdiv classlastfocus tabindex0 onfocusthis.parentNode.focusgtltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgtMore focusable stuff outside the dialog.ltdivgt codepre  pId rather see pure JavaScript solutions.

Negative 12193 pIm writing an app in iOS 5 using ARC that presents several hundred objects within a custom codeUIViewControllercode Ive written that a user may scroll through and select, each of which is presented as a thumbnail image that the user may touch.p  pEach of these objects has associated with it a special codeUIViewControllercode subclass that handles the custom presentation of the information associated with that object.  For example, it might be an image that can be zoomed and panned, or simply some text that needs to be formatted.p  pNow, each of my image objects has a large image associated with it.  Using the Instruments app to profile my code and running Activity Monitor, I see that these take up roughly 510MB each when the custom codeUIViewControllercode subclass loads and the image is displayed.  This is fine for a few images, but eventually my app takes up too much memory and crashes.p  pI have written in my subclasss codeviewDidUnloadcode method apparently all of the things necessary to tell ARC to free up this memory, but no memory is being freed until warnings are issued, which typically occurs when the app is about to crash.  A couple of times, Ive noticed that if I get close enough to the threshold but dont go over it, the codeUIViewControllercode subclasses that Ive previously viewed are eventually flushed from memory, although the codeviewDidUnloadcode method is not apparently called rather, the codedidReceiveMemoryWarningcode message is sent to my custom codeUIViewControllerscode.  However, most often, my app crashes as it runs out of memory.p  pSo my core question is, should I assume that an object will be disposed of by ARC as soon as possible, or does it always wait until space becomes tight  The behavior I want is for the custom view controller and its data to be flushed right away, so that memory never becomes an issue.p  pI do not believe there are any strong references from objects to my custom view controllers, and I instantiate them in my primary view controller using this codep  precode[self presentViewController[cObj grabModalViewController]                    animatedYES completionnil] codepre  pwhere codecObjcode is a custom class with the objects information.  codegrabModalViewControllercode simply instantiates an object of the correct type and returns the pointer, so presumably the local reference to the object should be trashed as soon as the method completes.p  pAs a result, I would expect that, when I later callp  precode[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES] codepre  pthe custom view controller that was only pointed to be the primary view controller via codepresentedViewControllercode should be flushed from memory, but this does not happen.p  pCould this be because I have strong references within my custom view controller objectp  pEssentially what Im trying to accomplish is to avoid as many memory warnings as possible by managing things better up front, but perhaps this is not the right attitude.p  pId appreciate any suggestions and Im happy to post any and all code that would be helpful.p

Negative 12193 pAs JSONP requests are created in the following wayp  precodevar scriptdocument.createElementscript script.srcurl script.onLoadfunctiondosomething document.body.appendChildscript codepre  pMy question is that, is there a w3c standard, crossbrowser supported event like onBeforeLoad which in turn let us stop executing downloaded script, in case it is not a wellformed JSONP response, or it is not passing through some predefined scheme validation, or just in case it consists of some harmful codebasic script validation I know of the onBeforeLoad event supported in some browser out there, but focusing on the downloaded script datasource and in any of the reasons stated above,  it would be extemely useful to have crossbrowser access to the loading script source, and due to good reasons,  the possibility to stop the execution, just before it is started.p  pFor example the above script could be the followingp  precodevar scriptdocument.createElementscript script.srcurl script.onBeforeLoadfunction        ifjson.parseJsonthis.dataSource ampamp            json.validateAgainstschema,this.dataSource                   return false                else           return true          if onBeforeLoad return true, onLoad will not be fired script.onLoadfunctiondosomething document.body.appendChildscript codepre  pI know that JSONP is all about trust in the 3rd party javascript module, hence i sometime wish that if i could validate those modules just before i am using it.p

Negative 12193 pI have two different applications on the same server.

The second application should have secure websockets support wss protocol.  p  pI tried to set up juggernaut gem for websockets for my rails app with nginx server on the engineyard cloud, but i have one problem. Engineyard cloud provide only two opened ports 80 and 443. I know that nginx do not fully support http 1.1 reverse proxing, so i cant use proxing from nginx for redirects websockets requests to the specific local port in my case this port is 8080.p  pI tried use HAProxy and its work for me when i use only unsecure websockets, but i need to support secure websockets. As i know in this case i should use something like STunnel for tunneling my https request and than use HAProxy, but when i test it  i saw that the server has to work several times slower and i still did not work to use the secure socket connection p  pMaybe Im doing something wrong Maybe someone will tell how to set up nginx for multiple applications one of them should work via https and secure websockets using only two ports 80 and 443.p  pp.s. Also i used a nodehttpproxy, in this case i was able to set up proxy for different nginx applications but i do not get run websockets happened only for handshake via nginx, not for switching protocolsp

Negative 12193 pwhen you dynamically load a library at runtime using LoadLibrary in windows C, does it load into memory the same as the rest of your program, or might there be some overhead associated with calling functions referenced from that library  In other words, if you plan on making frequent calls to a function, will it be just as fast from the library as it would if you linked it into you program at compiletime, or do you lose some performancep  pThis is not related to libraries that link to or against a program during compiletime via .lib.a files.p

Negative 12193 pId like to represent 2d cartesian cordinates in a 2d JS array.  The 2d space is of indeterminate size can extend into x and y space too.  This is fine for positive x and y values, but with a minimum index of 0 in JS arrays I cant extend into negative x and y space.p  pI have read some short information about the possibility of using negative indexes in JS, and that apparently these are technically possible, though not properly supported e.g. array functions moght not work properly.  p  pIm sure others must have had a similar requirement, so Id like to ask  whats the recommended way of modelling this in JS Are negative array indexes a workable solutionp

Decode the string, and check if the number is in there.pli ol  pWhich one is more efficient Would number 1 cost more reads than option 2 And would number 1 writes cost more than number 2, since indexing each value costs a write. What if I dont index  which solution would be better thenp

Negative 12193 pI have downloaded the source of GMP library 5.02, and  as suggested a hrefhttpgmplib.orgmanualDebugging.html relnofollowherea for maximum debuggability  I ran p  precode.configure disableshared enableassert enableallocadebug hostnone CFLAGSg codepre  pand compiled it with make, then installed the library with make install. I then compiled my program like this codegcc lgmp stdc99 g c program.ccode and then I ran  codeltrace .a.outcodep  pHowever I realized that ltrace is not at all invoking the TRACE functions I can find in the source code. I would like to trace the content thats in TRACE.p  pHow should I go for that Or is there any other straightforward way of debugging inside the GMP library I couldnt figure it out how to do it with gdb, it never wanted to step into gmpprintfp  pThanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong I tried to investigate further, and realized that I couldnt modify the GMP library although I had the sources. I inserted a codeprintfhelloncode at the very beginning of the codempzinit2code function which I do call at the beginning of my program, I recompiled all GMP even after a codemake cleancode reinstalled the library with codemake installcode, then I compiled and launched my program, but it never printed hello. I also made sure, I wasnt using another installed GMP library when I do codemake uninstallcode my program cannot compile as it does not find the library. Still, I insisted that gcc looks for the library in the GMP source folder with the L option.p  pI dont know what Im doing wrong p

Negative 12193 pI have created a program in Actionscript 3 Flash CS5 that spawns an Egg a circle for now off the stage when you click, and then sends the Egg to where you clicked with a coded tween. Additionally, it scales it in attempt to give an illusion of 3D.p  pI add a TweenEvent.MOTIONFINISH to one of the tweens for the Egg, to check when the motion finishes. When it does, I create a new object called Splat with the same coordinates as the original mouse click.p  pstrongProblem 1strong The Splat object isnt added in the correct spot, as seen in the picture below. I check the coordinates, and they match in both the Egg class and the Splash class. I have also made sure that the registration point for both objects is in the middle of them. Finally, I have checked to see if it was the scale that made the problem, but I get the same problem even if I remove the scale tweens.p  pEDIT The Egg is placed in the right spot.

Negative 12193 pI have 20 items of the same type in a database.  Each of the items has a row ID, name, description, and section A or B.p  pI have a web page that displays this information and allows the user to change the section attribute for each item.  The web page display has a pane for each of the two sections, section A and section B, and each section contains a button and a hidden field for each item in that section.  A buttons label text is the items name.  The hidden field is used to capture the corresponding item buttons section A or B.p  pWhen the user presses one of the item buttons in the section A pane, the button is moved to the section B pane and the buttons hidden field is updated to B. Likewise, when the user presses one of the item buttons in the section B pane, the button is moved to the section A pane and the buttons hidden field is updated to A.p  pAt the bottom of the form is a submit button.  When the submit button is pressed, all 20 hidden fields containing their associated buttons section A or B are posted and the php serverside script updates the database for each button accordingly.p  pIn such a case, is it best practice to use AJAX to maintain the state of the items on the server or hidden fields coupled with pure clientside javascript to maintain the state of the items prior to the form post  Whyp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 12193 pI am using the codeWMEXTRANSPARENTcode window style on some windows in an attempt to do doublebuffering with transparency.

This is goodp  pI dont think I need both the KeyDown and PreviewKeyDown. When I press Esc Im actually getting two Exit Page popups p  pThere is a problem though It seems like the Page doesnt get the KeyDown events unless I move the focus to a textbox or combobox and if I dont do this pressing the Esc key calls the second Windows WindowKeyDown and not the Pages KeyDown event which means the timer on the page doesnt get stopped even after the second Window is closed. Does anyone know a way to get the page focus when the page loads so that I can get the KeyDown event without manually changing the focus to a control on the Pagep  pThanksp

Negative 12193 pCurious if anyone has tried something like thisif it would workp  pMany premium WordPress themes allow the administrator to change theme setting like color and typography and then typically either inject CSS directly into the header to override the defaults OR switch between a number of preset stylesheets.p  pWould it be possible to allow an administrator to instead use theme options to set base colors, typography rules, etc. and then use these to set LESSSASS variables and run the compiler to spit out a completely new style.css file that would be rebuilt using those variables in the place of the default values obviously we would also want a way to revert to the default.p  pI THINK this should be possible and might actually be a great lightweight approach to allow for some pretty advanced customization but Im curious if anyone has tried something similar and what potential drawbacks I might run into.p

Negative 12193 pI have an ASP.NET vb.net rather than c website with a large number of individual pages. To cut down on duplicated code, I have the sites main template as a master page.p  pThere is a particular variable lets call it Sale which is used in every single page AND the master page.p  pAt the moment, Ive got a simple SQL query in every page AND in the master page that runs each time the page is loaded to check what the value of Sale is either a 1 or a 0 and, depending on that value different sections of code display.p  pMy problem is that this seems to me like a lot of redundantduplicate SQL calls.p  pI could write the value of Sale to a session variable, but for a whole bunch of reasons this isnt really practical, so what other options are open to mep

pDepending on the filter that is selected, the appropriate list of data operations, jobs, shifts, or hours will be loaded into panel 1 and the jQuery Overscroll plugin is used to create an IPad scrolling effect.p  pThe problem is in the ShiftsViewModel on the line where the Overscroll plugin is being called. When debugging, I noticed that the plugin isnt doing anything because the container element has no widthheight.  When running the program, the container is updated with the correct data, so it looks like the call to overscroll is running before the data is written to the DOM container by Knockout.p  pSince the overscroll call is inside the ajax callback which runs after data is received, I thought it would be OK. Is Knockout asynchronously updating the DOM  Im not sure where to go from here... Any suggestionsp

Negative 12193 pWell the title of this question might not actually reflect what I want, I couldnt think of anything better. Maybe I shouldve appended a emand then join two tables acquired this wayem to the end.p  pLets say I have this table. The scenario is, we pay loans with id codeloanidcode, and we store payments of that in the table Payment, each payment has its own codeidcode. When customer pays the payment, we change codepaidcode to code1code.p  precode  loanid  id  amount  paid          1   1    1000     1         1   2    1000     1         1   3    1000     0         2   4   10000     0         3   5   20000     1   codepre  pAnd now we need a report on loans. The output should look like thisp  precode  loanid   paid  remaining          1   2000       1000         2      0      10000         3  20000          0   codepre  pThe codepaidcode column is basically sum of all codeamountcode fields where pay  1. And the coderemainingcode is sum of the codeamountcode rows for which pay  0. They should be grouped by codeloanidcode.p  h2What I triedh2  pI tried different joins, products, etc but the best thing I could get out of my queries was this onep  precodeSELECT loanid, SUMpaid, SUMremaining FROM      SELECT loanid, 0 AS paid, SUMamount AS remaining     FROM Payment     WHERE paid  0     GROUP BY loanid      UNION      SELECT loanid, SUMamount AS paid, 0 AS remaining     FROM Payment     WHERE paid  1     GROUP BY loanid  GROUP BY loanid codepre  pBut I guess there should be better ways than mine.p

Due to this we have had a number of issues with bugs and worksinprocess entering production and having no idea what changes are in those SNAPSHOTS. p  pWhat I am looking to do is to eliminate SNAPSHOTS and move to automatic releases with the versionsmavenplugin and to implement a release Staging policy. p  pAnd here in lays the problem. For developers and for the CI build it needs to be configured to resolve dependencies from Staging and Release and publish ONLY to Staging. We then want to be able to Promote that build as a release, rebuilding it to resolve dependencies from Release and publish to Release initially this will be a manual promotion but we may wish to automate this also. Does this all sound reasonablep  pI do not want to use the mavenreleaseplugin because we have tried to use this before and we dont like the fact that it modifies the pom automatically and makes changes in our scm, triggering more builds.p  pAlso, is there even a way to tell maven to use one repository for resolving and another to publish to Could I do this with gradlep  pAny commentsideas on this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 12193 pI am making a camera app and this app will be provide some filters to users. Currently my code is on NDK and it works Ok, however i want to make it a bit faster. It seems GPU and opengl Es 2.0 is way to go. My only concern with GPU is that their memory limitation. Since modern cameras take 510 mp images while GPU memory limitation is far less than that. I was wondering if there is a way to work around that limitation. The only logical option seems to me is dividing the image smaller part, and then processing them on GPU and finally assamble them to final image. My question is, if this approach still would be good for performance and also is there any other option to image processing high resolution images on mobile GPUs.p  pEdit I need to clarify that i want to use GPU for image processing so my goal is not to render results to screen. I will render it to another texture and save it to disk. p

Negative 12193 pSay I want to run something like the nyan cat telnet server httpmiku.acm.uiuc.edu and I need to handle 10,000 concurrent connections total.

Each server can handle 1,000 concurrent connections, and I want to put a load balancer in front of it to randomly divide the traffic to the 10 servers.p  pFrom what Ive read, its fairly simple for a load balancer to pass an HTTP request along with the client IP to the backend server, perhaps with FastCGI or with an X header. p  pWhat would be the simplest way for the load balancer to pass the client IP to the backend server in this case with a simple TCP server Would a hardware load balancer be needed, or are there ways to do this simply through softwarep  pIn other words, is there a uniform way to pass client IP when load balancing for nonHTTP stuff The same way Google gets client IP when they loadbalances Google Talk XMPP server or their Gmail IMAP server p  pThis isnt for anything in specific Im just curious about if and how it can be done.

Then append the username and then append second part of the string.p  pI think is better than this one. Define Hi Username, have a nice day, and use replace method for replace username for the current user name.p  pIf I think it in term of C. The split will iterate over a char to find all the tokens in this case, then create an array of char of tokenCount 1 positions. Then will iterate again over the char for copying the string to the arrays of . Will iterate 2 times.p  pIn the latter the replace method must find the word character by character. And will be times when we want to find 1234567890 and if a part of the string have 123456789, it will iterate till last character to figure out that is not the string. Then it must reallocate the pointer of the char to reserve more memory space. p  pCorrect me if Im wrong.p
Negative 12193 pI recently started working with MongoDB and Apache Solr. I am using MongoDB as a data store and I want Apache Solr to create index for my data for the search feature in my application.p  pAfter some research I found out, there are basically 2 methods to sync the data between MongoDB and Solr.p  p1 using Solr DataImportHandler  p  pFor this I used SolrMongoImporter created by james and followed his tutorial on a hrefhttpsgithub.comjames75SolrMongoImportergithuba  p  pI was able to successfully run the Import Handler and Solr identified the ImportHandler but it was not importing any documents into solr. Every time it said updated documents0.p  p2 Then I tried switching to MongoDB side, to look if anything exists there and I found  a hrefhttpsgithub.com10genlabsmongoconnectorMongoDBConnectora provided by 10gen. p  pWhen I followed the instructions, and ran the connector, it is trying to post lot of documents to Solr and it gives the following output.p  precode20121124 151520,665  INFO  Finished httplocalhost8983solrupdatecommittrue POST with body ltcommit gt in 0.010 seconds. 20121124 151521,674  INFO  Finished httplocalhost8983solrupdatecommittrue POST with body ltcommit gt in 0.009 seconds. 20121124 151522,683  INFO  Finished httplocalhost8983solrupdatecommittrue POST with body ltcommit gt in 0.008 seconds. 20121124 151523,694  INFO  Finished httplocalhost8983solrupdatecommittrue POST with body ltcommit gt in 0.010 seconds. 20121124 151524,702  INFO  Finished httplocalhost8983solrupdatecommittrue POST with body ltcommit gt in 0.008 seconds. 20121124 151525,711  INFO  Finished httplocalhost8983solrupdatecommittrue POST with body ltcommit gt in 0.008 seconds. 20121124 151526,722  INFO  Finished httplocalhost8983solrupdatecommittrue POST with body ltcommit gt in 0.010 seconds. codepre  pBut no data is there in Solr.p  pI wanted to know which approach worked for you guys, and is there any good tutorial on MongoDB and Solr Integration.p  pAlso, I am looking for a realtime sync between MongoDB and solr, i.e. as soon as any product is added to my mongodb, I want it updated in solr index and reflect in search results.p  pI am using MongoDB 2.0.4 and Solr 3.6.1.p

Negative 12193 pIm trying to figure out how to go about making an app that will have buttons that will when pressed cause my mac to key a certain character or modifier. Ive already got the buttons laid out exactly as a want them so my project is now just two steps away from being completep  ol lisend a message to the mac to let it know which key to press.li lihave the mac press the actual key For 1 Im thinking of setting up a bonjour service which which send a string associated with the key that is pressed on the ipad to the mac. the mac would then receive this. Some of the keys on my keyboard a characters that require shift i.e.  so im thinking for this the code would be something like S120. Whatever receives the message would then read the string see that it needs to stimulate shift the press the key associated with 120. For 2 I have less idea. Keep in mind this needs to be fast as it will be keyboard. Im thinking of making an iokit project that will receive the string decode it and simulate the correct key. This could be overkill though, and Ive heard that you really have to be careful when dealing with the kernel. If my ideas are incorrect, please suggest a better way and fill in details. Thanksli ol

Negative 12193 pIm doing an iPad app that utilizes video mirroring to mimic the content Im putting on the iPads display. But Id like to add some additional content to the screen without screwing up the mirroring.p  pMy thought was to create an external window that takes up only a portion of the screen, thereby hopefully leaving the video mirror content still visible. So Im trying this admittedly dicey approach, and every time it blows up to be fullscreen which I can see because Ive set its background color to red.p  precode            CGRect externalScreenFrame  CGRectMake0, 0, 200, 200             UIWindow externalWindow  [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrameexternalScreenFrame]             externalWindow.autoresizingMask  UIViewAutoresizingNone             externalWindow.backgroundColor  [UIColor redColor]             externalWindow.screen  externalScreen             externalWindow.hidden  NO codepre  pAm I doing something wrong Or is this just flatout impossiblep
Negative 12193 pI wonder just out of curiosity why operator overloading isnt allowed in C for pointers. I mean something like this p  precodeVector2d operatorVector2d a, Vector2d b  return new Vector2da.x  b.x, a.y  b.y   Vector2d a  new Vector2d1, 1  Vector2d b  new Vector2d2, 2  Vector2d c  a  b  codepre  pNote how a  b creates a new Vector object, but then copies only its address into c, without calling a copy constructor. So it would sort of solve the same problem that the new rvalue references solve. Also, as far as I know, its pretty much equivalent to what happens when using operator overloading in C but I might be wrong here, Ive never actually used C, and why rvalue refs are not necessary in C. p  pTrue, the rvalue reference solution is even better, as that allows stackbased objects, while this overloading would force all Vector2d objects to live on the heap, but still, it seems to be something that would have been easy to implement in compilers, possibly years before rvalue refs came around. And with custom allocators, it wouldnt even be emthatem slow. p  pSo is this only illegal because of the least surprise principle, or are there other reasons too p

Negative 12193 pThis is a Blocked Port 80 related question, but maybe something a bit unique.  Ive yet to find a good answer.  Its more academic than anything as I know running a production server at your house is a ridiculous idea.p  pIm running a development server LAMP at my home but my ISP blocks port 80.  The DNS for my domain is set up to URL Redirect to my IP and port number.  My router is portforwarding to my server, and I have Apache set up so its listening on port 8081.p  pThe issue is that when you access the domain, the URL in the browser is resolved from my domain name to the IP and port number, and is displayed as such.  strongFor example, you type www.banana.com into the browser, the site is displayed but now the URL is shown as 12.23.456.118081.strongp  pIs there any way to fix this so that the domain name does not become IP and port numberp  pCan you use Apache proxy functionality somehowp  pCould you use modrewrite to change the IP and port number back to the domain namep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 12193 pI am building a photossite where users can upload photo and use it view later. These photos are not public and private. I am storing the photos and the thumbnails in S3.

This makes the browser load each image again when the user refreshes the site. It makes our page slow.li liThis also creates one more problem that if someone snoops into the source and all, he can find out the signedurl of the photos and distribute it to others for viewingthough the signed url is only for 10 mins. What I would preferably like is that the url be passed by my application so that I can decide if the user should be allowed or not.li ul  pPlease help me with what approach I should take, I want the page loading time to be fast and also serve the security concern.

Negative 12193 pIve implemented a multilayer perceptron and at first designed the training method to take a certain number of epochs for training. I trained the network against the XOR logic gate, and the majority of the time the network would learn how to solve the problem, but every once in a while the network would only learn two of the training examples and be stuck on the other two.p  pAt first I considered this unimportant, but later I wanted to change the training method to stop after the error is below some accepted error value that I choose. Now the network sometimes returns from training and sometimes gets stuck like I mentioned above.

Negative 12193 pI am an amateur hobbyist who has been working on a trivia game for the past several weeks. The first version of the game works well from the user perspective, but the code is super messy and Im writing a second version of the game from scratch. Im also making a significant change to the way the game moves between pages, converting from view flipping to the use of fragments. Based on my research so far, I think that the new design is more in line with best practices, but I am not sure I fully understand how the arguments for and against the use of fragments apply to this game.p  pDesign 1. The old design relied on three activity files MainActivity served as a splash page that allowed users to select the appropriate difficulty level, GameActivity delivered both the trivia questions emandem the answers with the help of a ViewFlipper, and ScoreActivity reported the users score while also making sure that highestScoreAchieved was recorded in PREFERENCES. p  pDesign 2. The new design will rely on a single activity file with a single fragment container and four fragments. StartFragment is the splash page, QuestionFragment is the question page, AnswerFragment is the answer page, and ScoreFragment reports the final game score. p  pI think that the fragmentbased Design 2 is more in line with best practices. The BIG NERD RANCH book on Android programming preaches A.U.F. Always Use Fragments on the grounds that it is always more difficult to go back and add fragments after the fact, but there must be other arguments in favor of fragments as well. p  pI have researched this on StackOverflow, and most of the examples involve different situations e.g. split views and reusable views.  p  pThus, my question What are the arguments in favor of fragments as opposed to view flipping in the context of the game described above Are there good arguments against a fragmentbased design for this silly little trivia game p  pAaron p

Negative 12193 pIn ANTLR4, it seems that predicates can only be placed at the front of subrules in order for them to cause the subrule to be skipped.

Negative 12193 pIm doing AI for a simple puzzled game and need to solve the following problem efficiently less than 1 sec  for the range specified since I need to do many iterations in a game.  p  blockquote   pA sample of N 1 to 100,000 monsters with strength from 1 to 10,000   are distributed on the sides of a square 0 to 200,000,000 at 1 unit   interval starting from the upper left corner. Move hero to a point X   on the square to maximize sum of the weighted distances to the   monsters. A weighted distance to each monster is calculated by   MonsterStrengthShortestDistanceToX by going clockwise or   anticlockwise. X must also be on the 1 unit interval mark and the   monsters and hero move on the sides of the square onlyp blockquote  pI have tried several approaches but none are fast or accurate enough.p  pThe possibly complementary of this problem minimizing the sum of distances to set of points at furthest distance from each corresponding monsters in the original set seems to related to finding the geometric median, facility location problem, Weber problem etc.p  pLinear programming is also possible but might be too slow and overkilled.p  pDoes anyone have any idea for a good approachp  hr  pHere is an illustration on a square of sides of length 3brp  pre 12M334M1                                12M2                        5                                11M1                        6                                1098X7  pre  pif you put a monster of strength 3 at 2, one with strenth 1 at 4, one with strength 2 at 12 and one with strength 1 at 11 and the heroX at 8. the sum of weighted distane is 36  14  13  24  33, which is also the maximum in this casep
Negative 12193 pI have encountered some strange behavior of ActiveRecord Relation recently.  Suppose, I have a codeStatcode model with the following properiesp  ul licodeclickscodeli licodeviewscodeli licodecreatedatcodeli liand othersli ul  pFurther suppose I have the following scopep  precodescope aggregated, selectSUMclicks as clicks, SUMviews as views.groupDATEcreatedat codepre  pAs a result I expect to get an array of Stat object with info aggregated by day, and so it is.

It turns out that when relation is not loaded size calls codecountcode on that relation, which essentially changes the query, returns a hash, and brakes the code.p  pstrongIs it an implied behaviorstrong p  pFor me it is kind of counterintuitive to change method semantics depending on whether relation was loaded or not.p

Negative 12193 pI have been working on a magento module for sometime now not because it is a large module, its my first and I really struggled with it. I now have it working, which I was really pleased with at first, but now I would like to improve it by increasing the reusability of the code.p  pWhile making my module I have looked at other modules to learn from them and have seen that many actions are only a line or two and I have tried keeping in with the skinny controller approach but failed, my example is as followsp  pI have a function that get a users details that they have inputted into a custom formp  precodeprotected function setPostData              thisgtsalutation  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostsalutation     thisgtfname  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostfname     thisgtlname  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostlname     thisgtemail  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostemail     thisgtemailAddressCheck  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostemailAddressCheck     thisgtgender  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostgender     thisgtcountry  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostcountry     thisgtpreflang  thisgtgetRequestgtgetPostpreflang          codepre  pI feel that this is not the correct way to do it and that there is a better way of achieving the same goal, as you can see this function gets the posts data and assigns it to attributes that ive set at the start of the class. I have several other examples that are very similar to the above and if someone could please offer some guidance on this one I am sure I will be able to work out the othersp  pThis example is held within the index action, should I put it in a helper as once it created correctly i am sure there will be a few occasions that I will be able to use it againp

Negative 12193 pIm trying to configure the rewrite rules for lighttpd so that a specific cakephp controlleraction is executed if a file is not found.  The controlleraction will generate the data png file, save it for future use, and then serve it to the client.  The next time someone tries to access the file, it will be served by lighttpd directly without executing any php.  In other words, the png files are cached so there is no need to recreate them.p  pFrom what I can tell, url.rewriteifnotfile is ignored if rewriteonce has a match.  Thus, the following can serve up my cached files but not my uncached files.p  precodeurl.rewriteifnotfile     scan..png gt mycontrollerscan1   url.rewriteonce     cssfilesimgjs. gt 12,   favicon.ico gt favicon.ico,       scan..png gt scan1,   []. gt index.phpurl1amp3,  codepre  pThe only solution I can think of now is to delete the 3rd rule and modify code[].code so it ignores urls starting with codescancode.  p  pAny other suggestionsp

Negative 12193 pI tried to write an application on codeplayframeworkcode  codescalacode  codeAngular JScode. The purpose was to create an web app that would work either good when JavaScript is OFF or ON in the browser. This is usual requirement when one writes Public Site which should be good for people and for Google that would index itp  pSo I ended up with strong50strong code written in codeJavaScriptcode, having two2 folders named strongcontrollerstrong  one for codeScalacode code, one for codeJScode code since AngularJS uses controller concept as well. p  pAlso, since codeJScode code is supposed to use codeAjaxcode calls, I had to create strongone morestrong scalacontroller that returns codejsoncode, but not codehtmlcode back to clients request. And.. this all I do not like. This seems as too much effort. p  pOn codeplayframeworkcode template side, I should think how to combine codeScalacode with codeJavaScriptcode, passing parameters from one language to another. Using some tricks like showing emthatem when JS would be processed, showing emthatem when it is supposed to be off. p  pThis all makes my template strongless understanablestrong, and one day, when I have huge code base, I may come up with a solution to duplicate my templates as well js templates  scala templates  to use proper template when codeJScode is offon. Then amount of JS code could rise up to strong60.strong. p  pAnd then it seems that Im going to strongduplicate everythingstrong, like having strongtwo different applicationstrong  for strongGooglestrong and for strongpeoplestrong. What would be common only is my data themselves in my database, I have not to duplicate data. But.. there we might have a different issue with a format of that data and most likely would be jsonbased [because I do not wasting processor time to do tableobject transformation], but not table based  NoSQL.. then again we come to JS like DB   like to strongMongoDBstrong, and codeJScode works very good with Json, strongnativelystrong.p  pThen question, why not use 100 of codeJScode for strongsimplestrong things like strongrequestresponsestrong, strongforming a pagestrong, stronglayoutsstrong. Server side codeJScode controller could form my templates  then I do not need to switch from one language to another and be even more productive in this sense.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Do you have any suggestions Best practices about this Im not that guy who want to end up using codeNodeJScode to usecodeJavaScriptcode as ONE languages for everything  for server and client. But lets speak about productivity and business needs.p  pThere is an example not mine of AnjularJS controllers, how much JS I have to write a hrefhttpsgithub.comtastejstodomvctreeghpagesarchitectureexamplesangularjsjshttpsgithub.comtastejstodomvctreeghpagesarchitectureexamplesangularjsjsap  pand just imagine that I have to keep PlayFramework controllers along with that  for HTML and AJAX calls, mixing things in scalaplayframework templates with JavaScript.p

Negative 12193 pI have a question about the order in which queued builds are processed by TFS 2012.

Immediately after this, I queue a build of definition Deploy.p  pThe Deploy build gets position 6 in the queue, which is correct. But for some reason, the Deploy build starts after the first Build build is completed.p  pAs these two build definitions have the same Tag and have the same priority, I would think that they would start sequentially in the order that I queue them.

Negative 12193 pThis will be just a noobie question This is one step of a multistage process which runs predominantly in IMACROS. So I need a solution which I can access by IMACROS in firefox browser. I have a working solution, but I know there is a faster, better and elegant solution and something which I can run locally on my computer.p  pstrongI cannot do CTRLF and search since it will be automated and IMACROS do not support keyboard shortcuts.strongp  pI have a imacros script which extracts a text string from a website, feeds it as input to a my 1000 line text file is preloaded in the text area online grep utility at a hrefhttpwww.onlineutility.orgtextgrep.jsp relnofollowhttpwww.onlineutility.orgtextgrep.jspa  and then extracts the first matching line and parses the output in required format using javascript and then submits this extracted and parsed text string to another website.p  pstrongATTEMPTS amp LIMITATIONSstrongp  ol lipI tried using imacros SEARCH command, but it takes hardcoded search string. I need something where it can take the search string as variable, since the search string changes at every iteration.pli lipI can programs whole thing in javascript and then do all the processing at each iteration .i.e. read the file, search and then output, But that will be unnecessary repeated reading the file from local hard disk and will be CPU intensive. THIS STEP IS DONE 100K times a day. THIS WILL BE SLOW AND VERY MUCH CPU INTENSIVE, I AM RUNNING THESE SCRIPTS IN VIRTUALBOX, SO RESOURCES ARE TIGHTpli lipI can program imacros to output search string to a file and then write a shell script to run every 0.1 seconds and get content of this newly created file and use grep, sed or awk to search and output in another file and from where IMACROS can read the string and feed it to another website. THIS WILL HAVE ISSUES SINCE SCRIPT WILL BE RUNNING NONSTOP AND I  NEED IT TO BE 100 ACCURATE, ANY ERROR AND IT STOPS THE WHOLE PROCESS DOWNSTREAM AND  I HAVE TO CORRECT IT MANUALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY, PLAUSIBLE SOLUTION WILL BE  SOMETHING WHERE SCRIPT IS CALLED ONLY WHEN REQUIRED, I WILL BE MULTITHREADING ITpli ol  pI need to be able to do it locally on my browser. Something like a search page, with input box for variable string and button to click and then it uses my CPU to search for the string in the HTML which can have the 1000 lines of text embedded in it so basically it can search the HTML or it can search the link to the local TXT file and show the output on same page.p  pA local clone of a hrefhttpwww.onlineutility.orgtextgrep.jsp relnofollowhttpwww.onlineutility.orgtextgrep.jspa will be perfect solution. But without all the ads and extra menus and stuff.

Negative 12193 pIm trying to figure out a good way to create tutorials for using Meteor apps. Visually, Ive figured out a good approach, and packed this into a smart packagep  blockquote   pstronga hrefhttpsgithub.commizzaometeortutorials relnofollowhttpsgithub.commizzaometeortutorialsastrong.p blockquote  pHowever, there is a second piece that turns out to be rather hard to figure out.p  pIn many cases, a tutorial app needs to be loaded with fake data, to demonstrate the interface to the user without requiring it to be populated with real data that may be hard to generate. For example, see a hrefhttpswww.planapple.comtripdemo349 relnofollowhttpswww.planapple.comtripdemo349a which is a demo for PlanApple. In Meteor, since the content of an app is basically defined by the contents of some collections, I see two ways to do thisp  ol liMaintain two sets of collections, one for the tutorial and one for the actual app. Use the first set for the tutorial and the second when the user is actually using the app.li liUse one set of collections, and fill it with fake data during the tutorial using a subscription and with real data when the user is actually using the app using a different subscription.li ol  pThe first approach is clearly bad it means that one cannot write the app without being agnostic to whether its being used as a tutorial or not and there is a lot of messy codeifelsecode reactive logic in presenting the app that is unnecessary. Moreover, this will be very hard to maintain if the app has more than a few collections.p  pThe second approach seems to be the more Meteoresque way to do things. What we basically want is for a server publication to fill all the client collections with some fake data, and then allow the data to be manipulated in whatever way on the client side without the changes propagating to the server the client basically gets a copy of the servers tutorial data and then makes only local changes to it which are then discarded. This boils down to two thingsp  ul lipSending fake data down from the server to client via a custom subscription into the same named collections as the regular app. This is definitely possible as Ive written in  stronga hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma18880927586086httpstackoverflow.coma18880927586086astrongpli lipIgnoring any inserts, updates, and deletes from the client on the server after the initial load of data but allowing them to happen locally. This is also possible if one creates null unnamed collections, as in stronga hrefhttpdocs.meteor.commeteorcollection relnofollowhttpdocs.meteor.commeteorcollectionastrong. pli ul  pThe problem is that although its possible to do each of the two steps above separately, I want to do both of them  I want the data to be loaded into the same named collections as the client would have with real data, to avoid the complicated control logic of having two sets of collections, but I also want changes to be localonly but not propagated back over the subscription during the tutorial.p  pAnyone have ideas about how to do thisp  pA related question about whether the second part is possible a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq19527436586086How does a Meteor database mutator know if it39s being called from a Meteor.method vs. normal codeap  pstrongEDITstrong It seems that what wed basically want to do in the tutorial is inserting directly against the local Meteor Collection as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19523301586086httpstackoverflow.coma19523301586086a. However, is there a way to generally turn on this behavior during the tutorial for all relevant mutators, instead of explicitly having to specify thisp

Negative 12193 pIm trying to create a form with Symfony2 v2.3.6 and take advantage of the autogenerated HTML5 constraints.p  pSo, I created a very simple form with just one field with a codeRegExcode constraintp  precodepublic function formAction      form  thisgtcreateFormBuildergtaddanimalName, text, array         constraints gt new SymfonyComponentValidatorConstraintsRegexcatdog     gtgetForm      if thisgtgetRequestgtisMethodPOST          formgtbindthisgtgetRequest           return thisgtrenderMeTestBundleDefaultform.html.twig, arrayform gt formgtcreateView  codepre  pAnd, in Twig, nothing out of the ordinary.p  precode extends base.html.twig    block body       formform   endblock  codepre  pWell, as a final result, I was expecting codeanimalNamecode field to has a codepatterncode attribute with value codecatdogcode. As it says in a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentreferenceconstraintsRegex.htmlhtmlpattern relnofollowthis linka, Symfony would generate the codehtmlPatterncode of this constraint I tested it, it returns code.catdog.code, which is ok, and this attribute would be used on client side validation by using codepatterncode HTML attribute on the codeinputcode element. But there is no codepatterncode attribute, the generated code is as followsp  precodeltinput typetext idformanimalName nameform[animalName] requiredrequired gt codepre  pAfter a little research, I think that the responsible of guess the value of codepatterncode attribute is codeSymfonyComponentFormExtensionValidatorValidatorTypeGuessercode, but this service is never initialized I wrote a codediecode in it constructor and also forced the container to get the service to check if codediecode is reached.p  pAm I missing somethingp

Negative 12193 pI am currently working on a 3d reconstruction of XRay images, and therefore I need to stereorectify images of two views before I can match some features with help of the epilines. I am using OpenCV 2.4 with C.p  pFor this purpose I got a set of pairs of XRay images cone beam Xray images, no real cameras with distortion parameters or a real focal length, one from the anteroposterior view directly looking at the chest, and one from the lateral view looking at the chest from the side. I know some parameters like a virtual focal length equal for both views that I can use, and the images have got a resolution of 512x512px, hence the camera projection at the images is at 255,255 for both views. Also i know that the cameras are perpendicular. From this information I developed a rotation matrix R and a translation vector t both verified with help of a 3d plot in Matlab.p  pProblem R and t are actually enough for a stereo rectification in OpenCV, but the resulting images after rectification are black. Googling led me to a bug in stereoRectify, but I doubt that it is the bug as I can run the OpenCV stereoRectification example which does work. When trying a stereoRectification in Matlab I can at least see some distorted rectification results.p  pHere is my C codep  precodefloat cameramatrixapdata[]  12072.0, 0.0, 255.0,                  0.0, 12072, 255.0,                                  0.0, 0.0, 1.0 cvMat cameramatrixap3, 3, CV64F, cameramatrixapdata float cameramatrixlatdata[]  12072, 0.0, 255.0,                  0.0, 12072, 255.0,                                  0.0, 0.0, 1.0  cvMat cameramatrixlat3, 3, CV64F, cameramatrixlatdata      brief the distortion matrices    cvMat distortionap4, 1, CV64F, 0.0  cvMat distortionlat4, 1, CV64F, 0.0      brief Translation and Rotation matrices    float Rdata[]  0.0, 0.0, 1.0,            0.0, 1.0, 0.0,            1.0, 0.0, 0.0  float Tdata[]  1207.02  255, 0.0, 1207.02  255   cvMat R3, 3, CV64F, Rdata  cvMat T3, 1, CV64F, Tdata   for int i1 ilt20 i  stdstringstream filenameAPtmp stdstringstream filenameLATtmp filenameAPtmp ltlt imageAPltlt i ltlt.jpg filenameAP  filenameAPtmp.str filenameLATtmp ltlt imageLATltlt i ltlt.jpg filenameLAT  filenameLATtmp.str      rectimgap  cvimreadfilenameAP     rectimglat  cvimreadfilenameLAT      Yes, these images are grayscale       Experimental      Stereo rectify both images  cvMat R13, 3, CV64F  cvMat R23, 3, CV64F  cvMat P13, 4, CV64F  cvMat P23, 4, CV64F  cvMat Q4, 4, CV64F  cvRect validRoi[2]   buggy cvstereoRectifycameramatrixap, distortionap, cameramatrixlat, distortionlat, rectimgap.size, R, T, R1, R2, P1, P2, Q, CALIBZERODISPARITY, 1, rectimgap.size, ampvalidRoi[0], ampvalidRoi[1]     Maps for AP View cvMat map1xrectimgap.size, CV32FC1, 255.0 cvMat map2xrectimgap.size, CV32FC1, 255.0  Maps for LAT View cvMat map1yrectimgap.size, CV32FC1, 255.0 cvMat map2yrectimgap.size, CV32FC1, 255.0  cvinitUndistortRectifyMapcameramatrixap, distortionap, R1, P1, rectimgap.size, CV32FC1, map1x, map1y cvinitUndistortRectifyMapcameramatrixlat, distortionlat, R2, P2, rectimglat.size, CV32FC1, map2x, map2y  cvMat tmp1, tmp2 cvremaprectimgap, tmp1, map1x, map1y, INTERLINEAR cvremaprectimglat, tmp2, map2x, map2y, INTERLINEAR  findHomographyrectimgap, rectimglat, CVRANSAC   codepre  pSo I am wondering what is wrong with this code or my matrices, as the rectification images after remap are completely black.

Negative 12193 pstrongHeres the problemstrong I have a website, cached by varnish, on which I want to do some AB testing. In order to do this, varnish needs to show some people one version of the site across all pages, and other people the alternative across all pages, while the URL remains the same.p  pI was thinking of doing this by having varnish read a cookie containing a hash value, and show the user a different cached version based on that. I know Varnish can do that because I already do something similar for dealing with currencies.p  pstrongNow the question isstrong  I need to set this cookie value on the first page a visitor loads. I need to do it as efficiently as possible of course, and I dont want a page reload otherwise I could have some javascript check if the cookie value is set, if not do an ajax call  page refresh or something.p  pHow could I achieve this Is it possible to have varnish check the cookie value, and if nothing is set yet which should only happen on the first page a visitor visits call a PHP API which will determine which version to show to which type of people etc Varnish can then use this value, and proceed as if the cookie value was already there. The PHP API can write the returned value into a cookie for the next page load.p  pstrongAlternativelystrong  Is there a better way to get the behaviour I wantp  pEdit Basically Im looking for a way to set the cookie with a value generated by a PHP script or command line command without having to let the request hit the backend.p

Negative 12193 pI would like to see if there is a more efficient way to get the previous and next buttons for my pagination script.  It is setup to accept one argument codeintcode that sets the codepostsperpagecode.  When on gallery view, images are listed and linked to with pretty permalinks, ex. codesite.commembername3483code  with the int being the picture ID.  p  pNow, because it is on a SINGLE view page, it only shows one image.  I would like to have next and previous buttons, that make use of the IDs, rather than the codepagecode query variable.  So, I am in need of a way to find the codearray positioncode in the same function.  p  pCurrently, I am making use of THREE functions to accomplish my goals.  They arep  pstrongONEstrong codefunction photogallerypaginatedpostsperpagecodep  pThis function takes the postsperpage, and returns the paged gallery. It is called like this on the gallery pagep  precodeallImages  arrayqueryuseruploadsall  pg  getqueryvarpg  getqueryvarpg  1 prev  pg 1 next  pg 1  codepre  pThe links are then built by manually adding the picture ID into the URL. p  precodelta classthumbnail viewphoto href..photosingleltphp echo imagegtattachmentid gtgtltimg srcltphp echo wpgetattachmentthumburl imagegtattachmentid   gtgtltagt codepre  hr  pstrongTWOstrong  codefunction queryuseruploadsattr, attachID  nullcodep  pThis function queries the same exact data that function ONE queries. It is used with function three below.  It is placed on the gallery single pagewhen you click an image from function one, this is loaded in the single page, and is called like this p  precodeattachmentID  getqueryvarphotosingle attachmentData  queryuseruploadssingle, attachmentID codepre  hr  pstrongTHREEstrong p  pThis is the function used to display the gallery single pagination from left to right.  The idea is once on a gallery single page, you can click next and previous to browse the users images.p  precodefunction locatebuttonsid, array     foreach array as key gt val         if valgtID  id            current  key            if issetarray[current1]                next  array[key1]             else                next  array[key]             if issetarray[current1]                prev  array[key1]             else                prev  array[key]             button[next]  next            button[prev]  prev            button[current]  array[key]            return button                return null  codepre  pThis is how it is called at the bottom of the pagep  precodebuttonsBuild  locatebuttonsattachmentID, queryuseruploadsall  prev  buttonsBuild[prev]gtID next  buttonsBuild[next]gtID codepre  pThis returns the next, and previous ID numbers for the images.  But this is obviously extremely inefficient, and calls the same DB data three times.  Before you bite my head off, this is my first time writing a pagination function and YES I am aware I can use codeID3483ampoffset3code  and I have used that.  But I want the ID to be rewritten in the URL for bookmarking purposes. p  pSo, to those who read this far, YES i will choose you as best answer if you can help me simplify this. Thank you in advance, and I will be here to answer any clarification questions. p

Negative 12193 pI have a python program that uses suds to pull data from a server in realtime.

Negative 12193 pI want to display a codeJFramecode when a user move the mouse pointer inside over a certain area of a codeJPanelcode with a little delay.

Negative 12193 pI am trying to integrate a third party product native media player as a Cordova Plugin. This is giving me a lot of problems with getting them to play along. Ive written an explanation trying to sum up my knowledge of the problem as best I can. Just thought Id write this as a short intro first. Any and all hints and answers are greatly appreciated. Because of the limit to size I will post the reference successful run as another post in this thread. Ill also post my question here as well as after the explanationp  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pMy question then is this Do any of you have any experience that might help on the matter Anything regarding 3PP native video together with Cordova might be very helpful.p  hr  pThe above picture tries to, in some way, explain the hierarchy of the cordova application. It is of course a simplification and might very well be incorrect as its meant to be a representation of my understanding of the system for reference in the text.p  pstrongWhat were trying to dostrongp  pOur application sets out to play secured and encrypted video streams through a native video player in a webview. Thats what it does in short form. In more detail Today we have a basic IPTV web application. However the HTML5 video player can not handle our encrypted streams. Instead we will make it a CordovaPhonegap plugin where the web application is still the main application but replace the html5 video player with a native 3pp library and display it playing the video a clear not encryptedopen stream. To the user it shall still look and feel the same way but decryption and playback is completely handled by the native cordova plugin. The playback surface view is then placed appropriately for display.p  pstrongWhat weve donestrongp  pWe have created the cordova project, made it run the web application and created a plugin structure. We have also created the crude VideoPlayer does not take control input as of yet, only plays a set video that wraps the third party product library. It manages playback approximately 50 of the time and when it does the surface is displayed and the video is played as we want it to be. However, about half the time during the initial play command to the native library we get an error that stops execution.p  pstrongWhats happeningstrongp  pNames relating to 3PP and company removed from log output, as an appendix I will include the log from a successful run for reference belowp  precode0514 135518.682  1751517515se.zxzzxzxz.videoplayer Ddalvikvm Lateenabling CheckJNI 0514

None of them stop execution though and exist wether playback succeeds or not. The execution stops when the various Fatal Signal 11 are received. These are unfortunately not the same every time.p  pstrongPossible causes and resolutionsstrongp  pIn trying to fix the problems I have tried a lot of different things, I will write some of my theories here for reference.p  ul liAt first I thought it was a threadingconcurrency issue between WebCore thread and the main thread. I was lead onto this path because of the errors that stated that android.view.ViewRootCalledFromWrongThreadException Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views and it took me a while to get the different calls and callbacks to all be executed on the main thread. I managed to make it all run on the main thread however and the problem still persisted thus eliminating the possibility of it being only a threading issue between webcore and ui thread.li liTurned off and on hardware acceleration, did not work.li liTried with different hardware, did not work.li liStarted the Video Player in a new project without cordova in it, this works perfectly, thus not a parameter problem since the same parameters to the player were used at this point.li liStarted the video player so that playback started with a set stream on creation, thus eliminating the call from webcor thread. This worked fine and adds to the confusion for me since I thought I eliminated the possibility of it being a threading problem.li liTried with different streams, had no effect.li liWhat I am left with is the thought that it has got something to do with the interworkings between the precompiled third party native video player library and cordova on a low level or in building of the project.li ul  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pMy question then is this Do any of you have any experience that might help on the matter Anything regarding 3PP native video together with Cordova might be very helpful.p  pPS This is my first stackoverflow question, sorry for the shabby formatting.p

Negative 12193 pAs a long time web dev, my usual answer to everything is use RegEx checking to strain user input. When Im looking at Mongoose queries, my gut is telling me I dont necessarily have to strain the input, assuming a length check maybe.p  pThis is assuming the express framework has already filtered down the input to either req.body or req.query.p  pFor example, a typical query could be like so in Mongoosep  precodeUser.findOne username  req.query.username , functionerr, doc     code  codepre  pstrongIs it possible to inject bad things into this specific querystrong I would expect yes as it seems hackers always employ very clever things, but would like to see some examples of this. I ask this because this is different than other ways of doing this in terms of not doing string concatination, rather using an object that is already a string or undefined. Thanksp  pPlease move this if its off topic and I apologize in advance as I was not sure where to ask this.p

Negative 12193 pI need to create a chart which consists of multiple series that have only one pair of values. it looks something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoQnPD.png altenter image description herep  pPicture is showing six series of one coordinate.p  pThe names of series and values are taken from cells of three different ranges each range have  only one column and all paired data are in the same row but different ranges.p  pButtons are created which triggers addingdeleting rows and resizing ranges accordingly.p  pIs it possible to adddelete series for each new resize of ranges Even if it means deleting existing chart every time and drawing new.  Basically it is needed to count rows of ranges and for each row to have series. p  pHope that I managed to explain myself. I would be grateful for any pointers.p

Negative 12193 pI need to have an Image blended together with an red square in mode multiply.

Negative 12193 pI went through the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3.0libraryunittest.html relnofollowUnit Test Casea module of python and found that there is way to force a test case to fail using the codeTestCase.failcode object. However I did not find anything that would force a test case to error. Any ideas on how this could be donep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMore explainationp  pThere are few test scripts which were written long ago and which Im using right now for testing a firmware. These test scripts use the UnitTest module of python. The test scripts also import a bunch of other userwritten modules. All these user written modules throw few exceptions. So whenever a test case doesnt call methods from userwritten modules with correct inputs exception are thrown. the UnitTest module rightly flags all such test cases as errors. But by looking at the output of UnitTest module, which is just a Traceback to the line where exception was generated, it is not immediately clear to me because of which input the exception was generated. So I used codetryexceptcode construct in the test scripts to catch the exceptions and print out the input which was the reason for exception. But since I handled the exceptions UnitTest was flagging these test cases as pass. Using the coderaisecode statement in the except block, as pointed out by alecxe, solved this issue.p

Negative 12193 pI am now working on  a VOD project and I want to try to build a proxy server like varnish Reverse proxy. I know it is not easy at all and I am just thinking about the feasibility. Ive done some researches and I found a powerful messaging library called Zeromq.p  pCertainly, zeromq is very useful for writing a server but I am not sure whether it is also useful for writing a varnish, or a proxy server that is similar to varnish I realized that there are a few functions classes in zeromq which is related to proxy server such as zmqproxy but I am not sure whether it is something that I really need.p  pI want a proxy server that can cache the video content in the memory from the root server and then send the stream back to the client. It would be much more better if the library have some builtin threadhandling classes functions.p  pWill zeromq store the content into the main memory Or is there any a way it canp  pOr do you guys have any other powerful library for writing a varnish server may be ACE or  Or should I just customize the varnish eg customize my own caching policy which I think is less fun instead of writing my own varnish serverp  pThanks in advance.p

The EXPLAIN for the query shows the parser is using an intersect with codestatuscode and codelikingmediacode and gets about code3000code rows to process with codeORDERBYcode. codeEXPLAINcode shows further codeusing where using filesortcode.p  pThe VPS behind it has 8 cores  2.5ghz, 12GB RAM. When the query runs very slow theres only low CPU usage. The CPU usage is much higher when the load begins to ramp up.p  pHow can I greatly improve the performance of this query under load when many php scripts are running it Can I tweak general mysql settings to fix it Or is the table architecture bad or is an index missing Id like to be able to run about 300 of this queries per second without loosing performance.p

Negative 12193 pI dislike using ids to allow Selenium to more easily find an element. I figure Selenium should leverage an accessibility ARIA attribute which will not only make Selenium better but also be more accessible to screen readers. In a sense, a bot like WebDriver should rely on semantics like a REST API.p  pcodearialabelcode seems to be a good candidate, something like codeltbutton arialabelcloseuserdialoggtcode, but are these attributes supposed to be translatable That would break my Selenium requirement, which needs a unique id that does not change.p

Negative 12193 pAccording to the documentation Ive seen, a developer is supposed to run codecordova platform add FOOcode before building a project. This seems like a bit of a shortcoming in the management of the build Id argue the information about the platforms the project supports should be contained in the project itself.p  pIf Im bringing on a new developer, she should be able to clone the project repository and build the project without having to askguess which platforms are supported. Since the code under the platforms directory is autogenerated, the recommendation is that it not be versioned, but Im not aware of this information i.e., the list of supported platforms existing anywhere else. It seems like this kind of data belongs in config.xml.p  pAm I missing something, or am I totally offbase herep  pMaybe a workaround is to implement a hook that loops through an array of supported platforms and runs codecordova platform add arrayitemcode, much like the a hrefhttpdevgirl.org20131112threehooksyourcordovaphonegapprojectneeds relnofollow010installplugins.jsa script in the example hooks a hrefhttpsgithub.comapachecordovalibblobmastercordovalibtemplateshooksREADME.mdwritinghooks relnofollowreferenced by the documentationa does. Is the beforebuild hook a reasonable candidate for this Im new to Cordova, so if there are reasons this approach doesnt make sense, Id be grateful to hear about them.p
Negative 12193 pI have an MVC5 application that I am just starting to do some Ajax on. I have a page with a button which when clicked opens up a Bootstrap modal with a form from another action. However, when that modal form is submitted, the jquery unobtrusive validation is not being called and the page redirects to a partial view on a blank page, instead of inside the modal dialog.p  pSo, 1 How can I get jquery validation to work inside the modal, and 2 How can I make the form not refresh the page, but reload the returned view into the modal and 3 Im confused by how Ajax.BeginForm is supposed to work as I would assume it wouldnt create a page refresh.p  pHeres the page which contains a button to load the modalp  precodeusing Plus.ViewModels model UserViewModel      ViewBag.Title  Personal Details  using Html.BeginFormnull, null, FormMethod.Post, new  class  formhorizontal       Html.AntiForgeryToken  A separate form here  ltdiv classformactionsgt     ltbutton classbtn btnprimary typesubmitgt       lti classfa fasavegtltigt        Save     ltbuttongt    lta classbtn btnprimary hrefUrl.ActionChangePassword, Manage, new object datatogglemodal datatargetmyModalgtChange Passwordltagt  ltdivgt    ltdiv classmodal fade idmyModal tabindex1 roledialog arialabelledbymyModalLabel ariahiddentrue databackdropstatic datakeyboardfalsegt     ltdiv classmodaldialoggt         ltdiv classmodalcontentgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  section Scripts      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         myModal.onshown.bs.modal, function               jQuery.validator.unobtrusive.parsethis              ltscriptgt     codepre  pThe View that contains the form I want to submit inside the modal dialogp  precodemodel Plus.ViewModels.ChangePasswordViewModel      ViewBag.Title  Change Password     Layout        AjaxOptions options  new AjaxOptions     options.HttpMethod  POST     options.Url  Url.ActionChangePassword, Manage     options.UpdateTargetId  modalForm     options.InsertionMode  InsertionMode.Replace   using Ajax.BeginFormChangePassword, Manage, null, options, new  class  formhorizontal, role  form       ltdiv idmodalFormgt         ltdiv classmodalheadergt             ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissmodal ariahiddentruegtamptimesltbuttongt             lth4 classmodaltitle idmyModalLabelgtChange Passwordlth4gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classmodalbodygt              Html.AntiForgeryToken             Html.ValidationSummary, new  class  textdanger              ltdiv classformgroupgt                 Html.LabelForm gt m.OldPassword, new  class  colmd6 controllabel                  ltdiv classcolmd6gt                     Html.PasswordForm gt m.OldPassword, new  class  formcontrol                  ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classformgroupgt                 Html.LabelForm gt m.NewPassword, new  class  colmd6 controllabel                  ltdiv classcolmd6gt                     Html.PasswordForm gt m.NewPassword, new  class  formcontrol                  ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classformgroupgt                 Html.LabelForm gt m.ConfirmPassword, new  class  colmd6 controllabel                  ltdiv classcolmd6gt                     Html.PasswordForm gt m.ConfirmPassword, new  class  formcontrol                  ltdivgt             ltdivgt          ltdivgt         ltdiv classmodalfootergt             ltbutton typebutton classbtn btndefault datadismissmodalgtCloseltbuttongt             ltbutton typesubmit classbtn btnprimarygtChange Passwordltbuttongt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt  codepre  pThe Controller for the actions       p  precodepublic ActionResult ChangePassword      ChangePasswordViewModel cpvm  new ChangePasswordViewModel     return PartialViewcpvm     POST ManageChangePassword [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public async TaskltActionResultgt ChangePasswordChangePasswordViewModel model      if ModelState.IsValid              return PartialViewmodel          var result  await UserManager.ChangePasswordAsyncUser.Identity.GetUserId, model.OldPassword, model.NewPassword     if result.Succeeded              return Jsonnew  success  true            Failed     AddErrorsresult     return PartialViewmodel  codepre

I have a form for users to add comments but if there is a  symbol in the textarea then it will not upload. p  pI reckon it might have have something to do with the encoding. I am using phpmyadmin and the encoding for the textarea is utf8gerenalci. But I can manually put this symbol into the database. It is only when it is uploaded through the form which has no character restrictions on the textarea.p  pThere may be more symbols that cannot be uploaded. I dont want to have to stop users from using the  symbol. Hopefully there is a simple answer even if it does make me look stupid. Thank you for your time.p
Negative 12193 pIm looking into custom events in JavaScript.p  pAccording to MDN, using the CustomEvent constructor, there is an option to make the event bubble up false by defaultp  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPICustomEventCustomEventInit relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPICustomEventCustomEventInitap  pExamplep  precode add an appropriate event listener obj.addEventListenercat, functione  processe.detail    create and dispatch the event var event  new CustomEventcat, detailhazcheeseburgertrue obj.dispatchEventevent codepre  pI tested it on jsfiddlep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netppx4gcxe relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netppx4gcxeap  pAnd the bubble up functionality seems to work. But Id like my custom event to trickle down, that is to trigger even listeners on child elements the opposite of bubbling up.p  pI vaguely remember some default browser events trickling down. This was supposedly one of these points of contention in the early browser days.p  pAnyway, is there any way to get this functionality on my custom events Any relatively easy and straightforward way, of course. I dont really want to write a function to traverse all child elements and manually trigger any listeners on them. I hope theres another way.p

Negative 12193 pI am observing some strange behaviors in my java application. Minor GC pause times are very stable, between 2 to 4 milliseconds, and spaced several seconds apart ranging from around 4 seconds to minutes depending on busyness. I have noticed that before the strongfirststrong full GC, minor collection pause times can spike to several hundred milliseconds, sometimes breaching the seconds mark. However, after the first full collection, these spikes go away and minor collection pause times do not spike anymore and remain rock steady between 24 milliseconds. These spikes do not appear to correlate with tenured heap usage.p  pIm not sure how to diagnose the issue. Obviously something changed from the full collection, or else the spikes would continue to happen. Im looking for some ideas on how to resolve it.p  pSome detailsp  ul liI am using the server flag.

Negative 12193 pSo I have been working with Saxon quite a bit recently and am having some concerns about its memory management ability. p  pFrom what I understand Saxon does not take data as streams which means that if I need to make comparisons on 1000 tuples all 1000 tuples are allocated memory. This seems like a flawed system to me. Is there a reason behind this other than limitations in javap  pI feel like this really makes XQuery a less viable alternative to SQL and JDBC which supports streaming. p

Negative 12193 pMy app shows two tabulated set of data the main table with the primary data and a subtable with related records in a rendered partial view.p  pFor the main table, I have implemented a simple paging functionality. I use codePageInfocode class to store information on actual page, maximum page, number of all pages etc. All this is returned to View in a ViewModel. I also use hidden control and POST form method to send an altered page back to a Controller.  First I store the current page in a hidden control and then use jQuery to alter the page 1, 1, frist, last and send such updated value of a control to the Controller. I struggled to send the page info to the Controller so added a hidden form field and retrieve its value in Action using ModelBinder.p  pThe problem is that I render partial View which is also tabulated data. I would like to apply independent inner page navigation in this subtable. However, I dont know how to use second form if its possible. It looks like POST method is not the best option.p  pHow can I send separated page information to a partial view. Then how to control whether user clicked inner version of next, previous buttons etc. How can I send this info to controller of the Partial Viewp  phr  EDIT.p  pIn edit, I have addedp  ol liA copy of class representing pagination informationli liController with specific actions.li liViewli ol  pThis is the way I have done it. The first time codeIndexcode is requested, I set default values for codeSortingPagingFilteringInfocode currently it holds only info on pagination. Everything is put into codeViewModelcode and sent to View. I use codeAjaxcode to replace html in codeltdiv idlistOfRecordingsgtltdivgtcode with code generated by a partial view and also to navigate around pages. As can be seen, I also use a Form Control in this little codep  precodeusing Html.BeginForm      Html.Hiddenpage, Model.SPFInfo.CurrentPage  codepre  pto return updated page info. I replace its values in codeJavaScriptcode code below. At the moment its just a page number. I find it difficult to apply this technique to added pagination to the partial view which also shows tabulated data. They are related to main table by foreign key. Its 1 to many relationship. I tried to add extra codeFormcode with another codeForm Controlcode to PartialView but then Id have to have two codeFormscode. I dont know how to POST to two different actions  controllers.

Negative 12193 pWe have an existing DB and we started creating Entites for it using hibernate in Java. we are building a web application using play framework so we are using Jackson to serialize and deserialize our objects to and from the client. In one function we query the DB for a list of Entities Report for example and the problem is that some attributes are being Lazy fetched even though we explicitly specified an Eager fetch, which causes a problem in serialization using jackson, because it doesnt know how to handle Lazy fetched objects.p  h2Exceptionh2  blockquote   pNo serializer found for class org.hibernate.proxy.pojo.javassist.JavassistLazyInitializer and no properties discovered to create BeanSerializer to avoid exception, disable SerializationConfig.Feature.FAILONEMPTYBEANS  through reference chain xxxxxxxxp blockquote  h2Explainationh2  precodeOur current situation is We have a class report and a class user Class Reprot     [join and fetch eager]     User user   Class User     String firstName     String lastName   And we query a list of Reports ListltReportgt list  typedQuery.getResultList  When we try to serialze it JsonNode jn  Json.toJsonlist  it throws the above exception codepre  pFrom what we found, the problem is the fact that hibernate uses a cache firstlevel cache so it wont have to fetch things from the DB again and again, and it is probably what it does because each User can have more than one Reports. So what it does is query the list, and when it sees that the current reports user has already been fetched from the DB it puts a proxy instead of an instance, and that proxy is being treated as a Lazy object which cant be serialized.p  pWe searched for a solution and we cant find it, hoping anyone here can help us.p

This project is something I inherited so I did not set it up and am very new to gitgerritrepo etc.p  pAfter spending some time on this I think what is likely happening is that our git server is configured not to allow pushes except from the gerrit user and we use strongrepo uploadstrong to submit changes to gerrit and when approved it is gerrit that does the push.  This is just a total guess from someone that is just starting to look at this and may be completely dumb.p  pWhether my guess is right or not... I still am not sure what to do.p

Negative 12193 pI am looking for some advice, as I am currently drawing a blank on the naming for a collection abstraction. This may be a slightly offtopic question, so apologies if that is deemed the case.p  pI am working on a library that provides BTree storage, and supports several kinds of collection interfaces over this BTree, such as keyvalue maps and sorted sets. p  pA special kind of collection is one that explicitly supports nested child collections in addition to allowing regular map keyvalue storage. This provides the means for name spacetable spacekey space support.p  pMy current working name for this collection abstraction is MultiMap. But this does not feel right and is not really consistent with e.g. an STL multimap. But so far I have not been able to come up with anything better.p  pAny suggestions for a better name would be appreciated.p  pAs extra info, refer to the interface definition I am considering now belowp  precode Represents a map that can be the container for nested collections.     This allows having arbitrarily deep nesting for collections to support    organization into hierarchies of separate name, key or table spaces.     So instead of for example having a map that contains variable length     keys such as users1, users2, etc. a nested collection users     could be created that has fixed size integer keys 1, 2, .... Note     that storage for collections can be expensive. If not stored as a     small embedded collection with only a few items, it will take up at     least one physical storage page.

Negative 12193 h2Backgroundh2  pI am writing a tool to boot up an embedded ARM system over USB. This particular ARM system has a boot loader which can load a system over USB by emulating a Mass storage device and implementing some vendor SCSI opcodes which allow the host to write information to memory. My tool, which runs on the host to which the embedded ARM system is attached, is to send a zImage or other binary to the device using these vendor commands.p  pI use the Linux generic SCSI interface to send the commands.p  pAfter sending a few commands to write values into the registers that control the RAM controller, my program opens a file, then enters a loop within which it reads 4096 bytes at a time from the file, then sends them to the device.p  pI do not have any documentation for the SCSI commands that need to be sent. I have determined the protocol to use by capturing and analyzing the USB traffic which is sent by an equivalent windowsonly tool that the vendor provides. There are some strange aspects to this protocol, particularly that it accepts addresses and values in little endian format and that 32 bit values within the SCSI commands are not word aligned, however I dont think these have any bearing to the problem at hand.p  h2The Problemh2  pAfter sending the first 7 buffers, the program segfaults.p  pThe section that segfaults is as followsp  precodeint akusbbootwritefileakusbbootdev dev, const char filename, uint32t addr           uint8t dataBuff[DATABUFFSIZE]         sizet len          printfSTOREFILE FILENAMEs ADDR08xn, filename, addr          akusbbooterrno  AKUSBBOOTOK          FILE f  fopenfilename, rb         if fNULL                  akusbbooterrno  errno                 return errno                    Segfault occurs on the next line          while  len  freaddataBuff, 1, DATABUFFSIZE, f gt 0                  printfread lenldn, len                 int r  akusbbootstorememdev, dataBuff, len, addr                 if rAKUSBBOOTOK                          goto EXIT                                  addr  len          codepre  pThe segfault occurs calling fread.

Negative 12193 pIm working on an app which has a requirement for running some basic audio filters such as normalisation and reverb on a file.

Negative 12193 pIn Javascript I load some elements via AJAX from a server, and for each dataelement I create a codeltdivgtcode that contains another div and an codeltimggtcode. The inner div contains between 2 and 5 lines of text. I arrange three of this items side by side in a row, then the next three in the next row and so on.p  pBut since the texts have different lengths, I want to do some fineadjustment of the elements within each row. I want the topedges of all three images to be on the same height. To do this, I do thisp  ul liInsert the three codeltdivgtltdivgttextltdivgtltimggtltdivgtcodeblocks into their container.  li liGet the heights of the three codeltdivgttextltdivgtcodeelements,  li licalculate their maximum, and then li liset their codepaddingtopcode properties in a way that gives them all the same height.li ul  pIn Safari and Chrome this works perfectly fine when I turn on the console and set breakpoints to watch what is going on in detail.p  pBut when I turn off breakpoints in this two browsers, the textdiffs dont get their correct paddingvalues. p  pI am pretty sure, that  at breakpoints off  the browser is still working on inserting the three domelements and rendering the pictures, when javascript tries to measure the heights of the textdivs. So it measures them at a time when they dont have their final values. The script reads wrong values and so it puts wrong values to the paddingtopproperty.p  pThis does not happen in all browsersp  pWhen running normally without console and breakpoints it works always fine withinp  ul liFirefox  li liOpera  li liInternet Explorer running in a virtual Machine on my iMacli ul  pBut I have those problems inp  ul liSafari  li liChrome  li ul  pWhat can I do to ensure, that the measurement of an elements height happens when the renderingmachin has finished its manipulationp  hr  h2EDITh2  pI found out another very important detailp  pThe problem occurs, because of the height of the textdiv above the image. Sometimes the text fits very tightly into two rows. One small letter more in any of the rows and it would be three rows.p  pIn this case my script, that runs immediately after the div was created, measures a height of three lines 60 pixel, and everything would be absolutely correct, if this div did really contain 3 lines of text. My script manipulates the elements in a manner that would be perfect if this div really was 3 lines high.p  pBut obviously, some milliseconds after my script was running, the browser Safari and Chrome performs an improvement of fontrendering. And then suddenly the text fits into 2 lines, which makes the textdiv only 40 pixels high. And so the image moves up 20 pixels, and this destroys my just processed result all images was at the same positionp  pSo,does this give you any idea on how to solve the problem Is there a way to let that part of my script run after all renderingpolishing has finished Is there an event like codeonFinishingRenderingImprovementsDonecodep  pwritten on strongMay the 4thstrong be with you  Star Wars dayp

Negative 12193 pOn my website, I use Jquery Mobile and the switcher. The switcher works great to return the mobile site when on a mobiletablet platform. However, my need is for when a user does a search on their mobile for a page that is known on our desktop, for instance, casinoname and gaming  the url that comes back is the casinonamegaming and when clicked, returns a messed up page. The page uses the jquery mobile css, but pulls in the desktop content. How can I make the desktop url, on the mobiletablet device, go to the homepage of the mobile site, cleanly Unless there is a way for the browsers returned URL to take the user to the equivalent mobile page i.e. casinonamegaming desktop to casinonamegaming mobile. Still using jquerymobile 1.3. Thanks.p

Negative 12193 pI have two activities In first activity there is Facebook Login button in which user can successfully login. In the next activity there is a button to share on the user wall. Now before sharing for the first time, it goes to take the publish permission from user. And when user allows, it comes back, but does not continue the share operation. But the next time I go to the same activity and press button to share,then it shares everytime.p  pSo the issue is when for the first permission taken from the user it does not continue its sharing operation.

Negative 12193 pWhen my app runs, Im very frequently getting issues around the connection pooling one is QueuePool limit of size 5 overflow 10 reached, another is FATAL remaining connection slots are reserved for nonreplication superuser connections.p  pI have a feeling that its due to some code not closing connections properly, or other code greedily trying to open new ones when it shouldnt, but Im using the default SQL Alchemy settings so I assume the pool connection defaults shouldnt be unreasonable. We are using the scopedsessionsessionmaker way of creating the session so multiple threads are supported.p  pSo my main question is if there is a tool or way to find out where the connections are going Short of being able to see as soon as a new one is created that is not supposed to be created, are there any obvious antipatterns that might result in this effectp  pPyramid is very unopinionated and with DB connections, there seem to be two main approaches equally supported by Pyramid it would seem. In our case, the code base when I started the job used one approach Ill call it the globals approach and weve agreed to switch to another approach that relies less on globals and more on Pythonic idioms.p  pAbout our architecture the application comprises one repo which houses the Pyramid project and then sources a number of other git modules, each of which had their own connection setup. The globals way connects to the database in a very nonORM fashion, eg.p  precodein each repos init file def loaddatabase     global tables      tables[tablename]  Table         tablename, metadata,         Columncolumnname, String,      codepre  pThere are related globals that are frequently peppered all over the codep  precodedef functionneedingdatafieldvalue     global db, tables     select  sqlalchemy.sql.select         [tables[tablename].c.data], tables[tablename].c.name  fieldvalue     return db.executeselect codepre  pThis emtablesem variable is latched onto within each git repo which adds some more tables definitions and somehow the global emtablesem manages to work, providing access to all of the tables.p  pThe approach that weve moved to although at this time, there are parts of both approaches still in the code is via a centralised connection, binding all of the metadata to it and then querying the db in an ORM approachp  precodemodel class ModelNameMetaDataBase     tablename  modelstablename     ... field values  function requiring data from models.db import DBSession from models.modelname import ModelName  def functionneedingdatafieldvalue     return DBSession.queryModelName.filter         ModelName.fieldvalue  fieldvalue.all codepre  pWeve largely moved the code over to the latter approach which feels right, but perhaps Im mistaken in my intentions. I dont know if there is anything inherently good or bad in either approach but could this one of the approaches be part of the problem so we keep running out of connections Is there a telltale sign that I should look out forp

Negative 12193 pI am writing simple mapreduce programs to find the average,smallest number and largest number present in my datamany text files.I guess using a combiner to find the desired stuff for within the numbers processed by a single mapper first would make it more efficient.p  pHowever I am concerned about the fact that, in order to be able to find the average, smallest number or largest number we would require the data from all mappersand hence all combiners to go to a single reducer, so that we can find universal average, smallest number or largest number .Which in case of larger data sets would be a huge bottleneck.p  pI am sure there would be some way out to handle this issue in hadoop that I probably can not think of.Can someone please guide me.I have been asked this sort of questions in couple of interviews as well.p  pAlso while running my Find Average mapreduce program I am facing an issue, the only running mapper is taking too long to complete.I have increased the map task timeout as well but it still gets stuck.Whereas with the help of stdout logs I have found that my mapper and combiner are executed smoothly.Hence I am not able to figure out what is causing my mapreduce job to hang.p

Negative 12193 pI am developing a C game server using codeWebSocketcode protocol through WebSocketSharp. Currently, whenever a user log in to the game, I create a token and add it into a codeConcurrentDictionarycode. Now that I need a user can only log in once at a time, and in the future, the server program may have multiple instances running on the same or different physical machines, I need to migrate from memory into database.p  pHowever, I need a very high performance authentication validation for each WebSocket request I have a sessionlike that save the token. Therefore, I intend to cache the tokens from database to memory the old codeConcurrentDictionarycode, because checking database for each request is not an option.p  pBut now I come into another problem of synchronizing. I have two ideasp  ul liPrevent a second device to log in once a token for that account already exist. The token will be destroy when the user log out. However, it is unreliable, because maybe the user could not log out properly network problem for example. In that case, the user account may got stuck for the sessiontoken lifetime. If the token lifetime is too short to prevent the problem, then again, my server has to check for the database too frequently.li liGive user the ability to log on again, and if there is already a token, the user can choose to emkickem the other log in, so the first user may be kicked while in game and the new one take place instead This behavior is similar to Steam games. However, without frequent check to database, how can the server know that the first token is kicked before the expiration timeli ul  pPlease share some experience andor any proper solution on this problem.p

Negative 12193 pI have created C classes before in nonweb application projects. Normally, All you have to do is add a class file to the project and you can add an instance on the forms, no namespacing or using required. But I noticed in ASP.NET, when you create a class and try to create a instance, im getting errors saying the directive or assembly reference missing. I dont understand why Okay, so most likely I have to take the hard way, and create a class library and use namespacing or add a reference yet STILL the same errors.

Negative 12193 pBuild environment Xcode 7 beta 7 OS X 10.10.5 Swift 2p  pI have a project that is using the BSManagedDocument class from github to wrap core data into an NSDocument. I am using Cocoa bindings to get the data from core data to an NSOutlineView using an NSTree Controller.p  pThe object model is fairly simple. The object called SourceGroup tied to the tree controller has a onetomany relationship with itself to provide the hierarchical data for the tree controller. It also has an optional onetoone relationship with a Media object that provides a URL for associated media image, video, etc..p  pThe outline view has three columns bound, two are bound to properties of the main object while the third is a thumbnail image that comes from the onetoone media relationship.p  pEverything displays fine but someitmes when I close the document I get an EXCBADACCESS in NSGetUsingKeyValueGetter that goes back though NSAutoUnbinder and [NSTableCellView release] back through [NSAutoreleasePool drain]. This doesnt happen every time but it does happen occasionally.p  pIt I remove the column that is bound through the onetoone relationship it never crashes. If I add in a noncore data property on SourceGroup that simply returns the image from the preferredMedia relationship and then bind to that property on SourceGroup, it never crashes.p  pIt doesnt matter what the type of the field is. If I bind through the relationship, it sometimes crashes on close, whether its String or NSImage.p  pIve even tried generating my core data objects as Objective C rather than Swift but that made no difference in behavior. No matter what I change the one constant is that if I bind the view in the table column through the relationship it sometimes crashes on close. Yet, on the detail side, if I bind to the same fields through the selectionIndex that works fine and never crashes. The crash only occurs if its in the outline view.p  pI know the descriptions can be a bit vague so I prepared some screenshots unfortunately I appear to lack enough reputation to share them. Ill try to describe the setup.p  pThe tree controller is in entity mode with the entity set to SourceGroup. Its source descriptors and managed object context are bound to my view controller.p  pThe outline views content is bound to the tree controllers arrangedObjects controller key. The selectionIndexPaths and sort descriptors are also bound to the tree controller.p  pThe value for the NSImageView in the column is bound to the table cell view with the model key path set to objectValue.preferredMedia.thumbnail.p  pThis all displays properly but causes intermittent problems on closing the document. If I put a thumbnail image property into SourceGroup and then bind that image view to objectValue.thumbnail I never see the issuep  pI dont see anything in the docs about this type of setup being a problem but Im also new enough to OS X programming that I may have missed something.p  pCan anyone see a problem in what Im trying to do p

Negative 12193 pI have a 8 bit value that I want to store in an existing 32 bit value, while only updating the data on 8 bits and keeping the other 24 bits as they were before. p  pFor example I might want to store 0x01 0x00000001 into the existing value 0x01000100 and I want the result to be 0x01000101.p  pMy first thought was to OR in 0xFFFFFF00 to the 8 bit value I want to store to make it 0xFFFFFFXX. Then I was gonna AND that to the 32 bit value, but I realized that it wont work if the 32 bit value has 00 as the last byte and I want to store 01. Then I thought I would just use my original 8 bit value and OR it directly into the 32 bit value, but that wont work if the last byte in the 32 bit value is 01 and I want to store 00.p  pI realize that this might be a bit hard to read but basically what I want to do is to merge a 32 bit value of 0xXXXXXXXX and a 8 bit value of 0xYY 0x000000YY to become 0xXXXXXXYYp

Negative 12193 pSo Ive got a python script that, at its core, makes .7z archives of selected directories for the purpose of backing up data.

Negative 12193 pI have a page with a simple list of items pulled from a mysql table. Each of the items falls into one of two categories. In the database I have Status column. Items are either in Status 1 or Status 0. One for each group. p  pOn each of the items on the page Ive added a checkbox with the primary key for its row in the table. Within each item in a given category on the page. I also have a hidden field with the POST[Status] set to correspond to which group its currently in. With the code below, I have the Status array and checklist which is the primary key merging correctly into key and value pairs. p  pI want people to be able to check the checkboxes in both groups and have the status change with one button click essentially moving an item from one group to the other. I have three items that Ive been bouncing around between the two groups. p  pEverything in Group 1 works fine. I can move one item at a time until its empty, two items at a time, and all three at once with no issue. Group 0 is not working. I can move three items at a time with no issue, I can move two items simultaneously with no problem, but I can only move one item one at a time once. The second time around, nothing budges. If I select both of the remaining items in that group, only the first one moves.p  pIts very strange behavior. I think it has something to do with the way the if statements are executed in the foreach loop, but Im not sure how to solve it.p  precodefunction combinearra, b       acount  counta      bcount  countb      size  acount gt bcount  bcount  acount      a  arrayslicea, 0, size      b  arraysliceb, 0, size      return arraycombinea, b    ifissetPOST[Move]      ifemptyPOST[checklist]          combined  combinearrPOST[checklist], POST[Status]         foreach combined as key gt value              ifvalue  1                  mysqliquerycon, UPDATE items SET Status0 WHERE IDkey                          ifvalue  0                  mysqliquerycon, UPDATE items SET Status1 WHERE IDkey                             codepre  pHere is the relevant HTML on the page starting with the button that initiates the action...p  precodeltform actionindex.php methodpost iditemCheckgt     ltbutton formitemCheck classbuttonBlue typesubmit nameMove valueMovegtMoveltspangtselectedltspangtltbuttongt ltformgt codepre  p...then one of the checkboxes in the first group...p  precodeltinput typehidden formitemCheck nameStatus[] value1gt ltinput typecheckbox formitemChecknamechecklist[] valueltphp echo row[ID] gtgt codepre  p...and finally a checkbox in the second group which is identical except for the value of the hidden field.p  precodeltinput typehidden formitemCheck nameStatus[] value0gt ltinput typecheckbox formitemChecknamechecklist[] valueltphp echo row[ID] gtgt codepre

Negative 12193 pGood Morning and day to all I hope this makes sense. I was on here last week as I was missing one step to change my codeapp.jscode file to codeserver.jscode and got enough help to make it work. I am returning with an new issue that perhaps stem from that one.. Here is whats happening p  pI am working on a MEAN app and Ive been working as usual typing codemongodcode to have mongoDB running. and i was using codenpm startcode because it was advice to me but usually i use codenodemoncodep  pIve noticed that gradually my server just completely disconnects and I have to manually restart it by typing npm start again. The connection last about 1 minute before it loses it. However now it doesnt connect at all. I think it has something to do with losing connection to MongoDB because I have a codeconsole.logcode for whenever I dont have mongoDB running to remind me.. and this is the console log that my server spits outp  pstrongserver.jsstrongp  precoderequirenet.connect27017, locahost.onerror, function console.logHes name is MongoDB live from port 27017  process.exit0   codepre  pI tried switching back to running it with codenodemoncode while it gives me the impression that its connected as it doesnt spit out any errors when I update any part of my code or refresh the page, it just spits out the console.log message that I showed above and I have to exit and restart..with codenpm run develcode I have no luck either. this is not happening in other applicationsp  pHere is a look at my command line with all 3 attempts to connect to the server and notice how it spits out the codeconsole.logcode message.. I refresh my page and it doesnt connect at all anymore. It used to as I mentioned before but for a minute or so. I hope someone can help me out and point me in the right direction.p  pusing codenpm startcode, codenpm run develcode and codenodemoncodep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9Y40Z.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Y40Z.png altmy terminal starting servera p  pPackage.JSON file p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comTgjcX.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTgjcX.png altenter image description hereap
Negative 12193 pThis is something that always happens, but I never understood.p  pWhy in Interface Builder, if you leadingalign a view with the view controller, the margin shows up as 20, instead of 0p
