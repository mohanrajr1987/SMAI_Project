Positive 4190 pI have a dataset of 15M training instances in form of svmlight dataset. I read these data using sklearn.datasets.loadsvmlightfile. The data itself is not sparse, so I dont mind converting it to any other dense representation I will prefer that.p  pemAt some point in my program I need to add millions of new data records instances to my training data in random positions. I used vstack and also tried converting to dense matrices but was either inefficient or failed to give correct results details below. Is there any way to do this task efficientlyemp  pIm implementing DAgger algorithm and in the first iteration it is trying to add about 7M new training instances. I want to add these new instances in random positions. I tried vstack given my data was in csr format I was expecting it not to be too inefficient at least. However after 24hours its not done yet. p  pI tried converting my data to numpy.matrix format just after loading them in svmlight format. A sampling showed it can help me speed things up but interestingly the results I get from training on the converted dataset and the original dataset seem not to match with each other. It appears sklearn does not work with numpy matrix in the way I thought. I couldnt find anything in the sklearn documentation.p  pemAnother approach I thought was to define a larger dataset from the beginning so that it will reserve enough space in memory, but when Im using sklearn train or test features Ill index my dataset to the last true record. In this way, I presume, vstack will not require opening up a new large space in memory which can make the whole operation take longer. Any thoughts on thisemp

The functor is stateless so I assume the Operation constructor is free and the evaluation of the functor is just as efficient as an inlined function, but like all C programmers I always have some nagging doubt.p  pMy second question is whether I could use an alternate functor approach.. one that does not override the  operator, but does everything in the constructor as a side effect Something likep  precodestruct Operation    Operationint a, int ampb  baa   template lttypename Operationgt int fooint a       int b    Operationa,b      use b here, etc    codepre  pIve never seen anyone use a constructor as the work of a functor, but it seems like it should work. Is there any advantage Any disadvantage   I do like the removal of the strange doubled parenthesis Operatora , but thats likely just aesthetic.p

I think you can guess what they do.p  pWhat I was thinking though, could I build these into the getter and setter methods for my date property on the linqtosql created object model, or should I just go round the app everywhere re assigning how the value is saved adding an extra line to the controller likep  precodetask.taskDeadline  Utility.ConvertToUtcaspnetRepository.GetUserGuidUser.Identity.Name, task.taskDeadline.Value codepre  pIf anyone can tell me Im doing something horrible by going back to the db each time I need the user Guid, that would be cool. I guess down the line somewhere I would cache it, but this would require holding it in session or something I presume.p  pThanks all.p

Negative 4190 pIm working on implementing an event aggregation with Prism. I have a few modules, and I want each of them to subscribe to events that tells them when they are requested. I started out doing an all plain example with both subscribed and publisher in the shell. No problems there. Now when I move the subscribers out to my modules they dont get triggered. Whats even more odd is that it actually has worked a few times  all of which Ive been pending in a breakpoint. So it seems to me to be some race condition, but I dont understand why. p  pemAssumption madeem I dont need to set up the IEventAggregator anywhere  e.g. registering in the IoC container This is built into Prism such that I only have one instance of the event aggregator, right p  pSo, the question is basically howwherewhen I should set up my subscribers. Is there a specific order on stuff etc In my simplified example I have one module MyModule. The Bootstrapper will add MyModule to the catalog  making it initialized p  precodecatalog.AddModuletypeofMyModule codepre  pMyModule will store the aggregator and use this for subscribing to the MyModuleRequestedEvent. It also uses a menu registry to register in the application menu. The idea is that eventually clicking in the menu should trigger the event  notifying MyModule that it has been requested. Then I want it to be MyModules responsibility to figure out what to do further. p  precodepublic MyModuleIEventAggregator aggregator, IApplicationMenuRegistry menu      applicationMenu  menu     aggregator  aggregator   public void Initialize      var evnt  aggregator.GetEventltMyModuleRequestedEventgt     evnt.SubscribeMyModuleRequested     applicationMenu.RegisterMenuItemMyModule, evnt   public void MyModuleRequestedbool b      MessageBox.ShowMyModule requested  codepre  pNow, I have a button in my shell which will publish this event. The shell gets the same  event aggregator when resolved.  p  precodepublic ShellIEventAggregator aggregator      InitializeComponent     var evnt  aggregator.GetEventltMyModuleRequestedEventgt     EventTriggerButton.Click  s, e gt evnt.Publishtrue  codepre  pNotes p  ul liHave verified that the event is published. Adding a subscriber in the shell too will make this subscriber receive the event. li liAgain the subscriber in MyModule isnt triggered. However, it has  strangely  been on a few occasions. li liI dont use the input to the event. It seemed like you needed to have some inputtype, so I just went with a dummy bool. Can I get rid of this.. li ul

However, for sub elements I am overruling thisp  precodesub  color999 fontsize11px  codepre  pFirefox respects the 11px, IE 8 does not, it renders it much smaller, but it does respect the color overrule. This is the last thing I would expect when setting a FIXED font size. I can assure that there are no other CSS rules conflicting with this.p  pIf I increase the fontsize in CSS to 12px, IE will render it at 11px, but then in Firefox it is too big. Something strange is going on with the SUB element in IE.p  pI do have a solution, if I use something else to mark the sub text, for example a h3, both Firefox and IE do render the font size correctly. If there is no better solution I will go for that direction, but Im simply curious if there is a better solution Also I like the way the markup currently looks.p
Negative 4190 pIm writing a chat program and for the server, when I send data can the send function take a long time to send out the datap  pHere is my problem Im using linux 2.6 with epoll, server in single thread If send blocks, then this means all other activity on the server will stop. Like if there is a very slow client that does not send ACK responses for a long time to a tcp packet, will the send function just move on right away, or will it wait a long time for the client. The thing I dont want is for a singlefew slow clients to cause delays in the chat server.p  pWhat I want is for send to nonblock and to return very quickly. If it doesnt send all the data, it will simply return the amount sent and I will remove that from the buffer and keep sending next time serviced until all data sent. Basically I dont want send to block for a long time on a slow or unresponsive client.p

Negative 4190 pWe are creating multiple child classloaders to load in multiple subapplications into a Java application container, prototyping hot deployment.

So i used a small script to fix itp  precodeurl  GET[url] headerContenttype applicationforcedownload headerContentTransferEncoding Binary headerContentdisposition attachment filenamedemo.mp3 readfileurl codepre  pI would like to ask you if the above is safe. Moreover, does the server losses bandwidth by this way And finally, does it influence the servers resources Thanks.p

Negative 4190 pIm an old hand at C but a raw newbie at JavaTomcat. p  pIm fine with Tomcat session management in http alone. Its when Ive come to look at switching to https that Ive had problems.p  pI gather for Tomcat that you have to start with an http session if you want to maintain a session as you switch from http to https and back to http. This works fine for me when the browser is enabled for cookies. p  pBut when the browser is disabled for cookies and URL rewriting is being used then switching http to https or back again causes a fresh session to be started each time. Im assuming this is a security thing.p  pQ1  Is it possibledesirable to maintain a session between http and https using URL rewritingp  pQ2  If it isnt possible then what do ecommerce developers do about noncookie usersp  pI dont want to prevent noncookie people using my site. I do want some flexibility switching between http and https.p  pthanks for any help, Steven.p

Negative 4190 pa hrefhttpclifgriffin.comblockade2 relnofollowhttpclifgriffin.comblockade2ap  pOk, I have an unordered list that serves as a list of menu links. In each li there is a div that is set to absolute positioning, bottom 0. The idea is you hover over the link in the li and jQuery animates the height to show the hidden menu div.p  pIts a simple concept, but I am apparently a retard.p  pThe issue Im having is that the div that contains the slide down menu doesnt take up any dimensions according to Firefox and Chromes calculated style information when I put it in the li. If I put it anywhere else on the page it renders PERFECTLY. You can see what I mean from the link. The gray menu looking thing at the top is how it is supposed to render inside the li but doesnt.p  precodeltdiv classramgt     ltdiv classgraymiddlegt             ltulgt                     ltligtlta hrefgtGuest Servicesltagtltligt                      ltligtlta hrefgtConcierge  Local Attractionsltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtEast Restaurantltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtAquarium Loungeltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtHealth Clubltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtSandcampers Programltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtTreasure Chest Gift Shopltagtltligt             ltulgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classgraybottomgt             ltimg srcimagestopmenuslidedowngraybottom.png gt     ltdivgt codepre  pp  pThere is a bit of javascript going on that is supposed to find the height of the menu div and set the id of the containing li equal to the height so that it can be referenced later.

Negative 4190 pBack in 1985, when I was a Product Planner for ATampTIS Labs Unix Product Management, one of my primary duties was to evaluate emerging 4GLRDBMS products, submit product plans and recommend whether ATampT should pursue a comarketing or colabeling agreement with the vendor or just testcertify it as compatible on our 3Bseries systems. Some notable products I submitted plans for were Informix4GL 1.1, Microfocus VSCOBOL Workbench, etc.p  pOne particular sexy product which captivated my attention was Progress. Although, at that time, it didnt have SQL support, its featuresfunctionality, integrated RDBMS engine and integrated debugging editor, which allowed me to quickly execute interpreted code and compile it once it was debugged, appealed so much to me that I recommended ATampT pursue a comarketing agreement with the condition that SQL support be added to it. p  pWell, 25 years later and SQL support added, Im looking again at Progress as an option to rewrite my INFORMIXSQL based, singleuser, pawnshop management app for Windows and UNIX platforms.p  pI dont require networking or multiuser capabilities at this time, but that could easily change and would like that option as an addonupgrade option, which Progress offers. The personal singleuser RDBMS engine costs only 246Windows computer and the 4GL character and GUIbased development system costs about 2,600 onetime charge.  p  pAnyone here in SO have development experience, exposure with or have comments about  Progressp  pIm in the process of obtaining an eval copy and would appreciate any input.p

Negative 4190 pI need a function which takes an arbitrary number of arguments All of the same type, does something with them and afterwards gives a result back. A list of arguments is impracticable in my specific case.p  pAs I looked through the haskell libs, I saw that the function codeprintfcode from module codeText.Printfcode uses a similar trick. Unfortunately, I couldnt understand that magic by looking at the source.p  pCan somebody explain how to achieve this, or at least some webpagepaperwhatever where I could find a good description for thisp  pstrongMotivationstrongp  pThe reason I need this is really quite simple. For school computer science class, we are required to write a module that is able to record a mathematical expression, express it as a string Via writing an instance of NumRealetc for an own datatype, and perform various operations on it.  p  pThis datatype contains a special constructor for a variable, which may be replaced by a value or whatever by a specified function. One of the goals is to write a function, which takes such an expression with some number of variables pairs of type codeChar,Rationalcode and calculates the result of the expression. We should look at how to express the goal of the function best. My idea The function returns another function which takes exactly as many arguments as vars that are defined in the function  seems to be impossible.p

But there are no new lines as it translates each new line from the text file as 0D25, which is CRLF. This segment appears as .. on screen.br I dont want the the 2 dots that have the hex reading of 0D25 because I need it to actually place the data on the next line as it is in the text file.

Negative 4190 pI am using a codenetNamedPipeBindingcode to perform interprocess WCF communication from a windows app to a windows service.p  pNow my app is running well in all other accounts after fighting off my fair share of WCF exceptions as anybody who has worked with WCF would know.. but this error is one that is proving to be quite resilient.p  pTo paint a picture of my scenario my windows service could be queued to do some work at any given time through a button pressed in the windows app and it then talks over the codenetNamedPipeBindingcode which is a binding that supports callbacks twoway communication if you are not familiar and initiates a request to perform this work, in this case a file upload procedure it also throws the callbacks events every few seconds ranging from file progress to transfer speed etc. etc. back to the windows app, so there is some fairly tight clientserver integration this is how I receive my progress of whats running in my windows service back into my windows app.p  pNow, all is great, the WCF gods are relatively happy with me right now apart from one nasty exception which I receive every time I shutdown the app prematurely which is a perfectly valid scenario. Whilst a transfer is in progress, and callbacks are firing pretty heavily, I receive this errorp  precodeSystem.ServiceModel.ProtocolException   The channel received an unexpected input message with Action    httptempuri.orgITransferServiceContractTransferSpeedChangedCallback    while closing. You should only close your channel when you are not expecting    any more input messages. codepre  pNow I understand that error, but unfortunately I cannot guarantee to close my channel after never receiving any more input messsages, as the user may shutdown the app at any time therefore the work will still be continuing in the background of the windows service kind of like how a virus scanner operates.  The user should be able to start and close the win management tool app as much as they like with no interference.p  pNow the error, I receive immediately after performing my codeUnsubscribecode call which is the second last call before terminating the app and what I believe is the preferred way to disconnect a WCF client. All the unsubscribe does before closing the connection is simply removes the client id from an array which was stored locally on the win service wcf service as this is an instance SHARED by both the win service and windows app as the win service can perform work at scheduled events by itself and after the client id array removal I perform, what I hope feel should be a clean disconnection.p  pThe result of this, besides receiving an exception, is my app hangs, the UI is in total lock up, progress bars and everything mid way, with all signs pointing to having a race condition or WCF deadlock [sigh], but I am pretty threadsavvy now and I think this is a relatively isolated situation and reading the exception asis, I dont think its a thread issue perse, as it states more an issue of early disconnection which then spirals all my threads into mayhem, perhaps causing the lock up.p  pMy codeUnsubscribecode approach on the strongclientstrong looks like thisp  precode    public void Unsubscribe              try                       Close existing connections             if channel  null ampamp                 channel.State  CommunicationState.Opened                              proxy.Unsubscribe                               catch Exception                       This is where we receive the System.ServiceModel.ProtocolException.                  finally                      Dispose               codepre  pAnd my codeDisposecode method, which should perform the clean disconnectp  precode    public void Dispose               Dispose object         if channel  null                      try                               Close existing connections                 Close                  Attempt dispose object                 IDisposablechannel.Dispose                          catch CommunicationException                              channel.Abort                          catch TimeoutException                              channel.Abort                          catch Exception                              channel.Abort                 throw                            codepre  pAnd the WCF service codeSubscriptioncode counterpart and class attributes for reference on the windows service strongserverstrong nothing tricky here and my exception occurs client sidep  precode    [ServiceBehaviorInstanceContextMode  InstanceContextMode.Single,      ConcurrencyMode  ConcurrencyMode.Multiple]      public class TransferService  LoggableBase, ITransferServiceContract              public void Unsubscribe                      if clients.ContainsKeyclientName                              lock syncObj                                      clients.RemoveclientName                                if DEBUG             Console.WriteLine  0 disconnected., clientName endif                  ...      codepre  pInterface ofp  precode[ServiceContract     CallbackContract  typeofITransferServiceCallbackContract,      SessionMode  SessionMode.Required] public interface ITransferServiceContract      [OperationContractIsInitiating  true]     bool Subscribe      [OperationContractIsOneWay  true]     void Unsubscribe     ...  codepre  pInterface of callback contract, it doesnt do anything very exciting, just calls events via delegates etc. The reason I included this is to show you my attributes.

Negative 4190 pI have the following function in a C DLLp  precodeextern C declspecdllexport bool Existconst char name   if gQueues.findname  gQueues.end   return true  else   return false  return false  codepre  pInside my C class I have the followingp  precode[DllImportWhisper.dll, EntryPointExist, CallingConventionCallingConvention.Cdecl]         public static extern bool Existstring name codepre  pYet, whenever I call my function it ALWAYS returns true, even when I commented out my little function and made it return false. I have the feeling there is something wrong with my calling convention or any other issue with PInvoking my DLL, probably corresponding with the string and const char, but for now I am completely clueless. What am I doing wrong Why does it return true instead of falsep  pemstrongEDITemstrong I have figured out this has nothing to do with the const char or string, because the problem persists with an empty function. Ive tried changing the calling convention between Cdecl and StdCall and neither work correctly. Ive also managed to debug my DLL and its being called correctly and does indeed return false, but once back into C it somehow is true. Changing the CharSet also had no effect. Ive made sure Ive supplied my C program with the latest and correct version of my DLL each time, so that shouldnt be an issue aswell. Again, I am completely clueless on why the result is true when Im in fact returning false.p  pemstrongEDIT2emstrong SOReader provided me with a suggestion which fixes another important issue, see my comment. Sadly, it does not fix the return issue.p  pemstrongEDIT3emstrong I have concluded that changing the return type of Exist bool into int suddenly makes it return the correct number true  1, false  0. That would mean that there may be an issue between Cs bool and Cs bool. I can continue using an int as a bool, but that would still not explain the original problem. Maybe somebody else can enlighten me on this one Perhaps it has to do with the fact that Im using x64 although both pojects are compiled as x86p

Negative 4190 pI have an MVC app and I have started to use DTOs exclusively to send data to views.  I am using AutoMapper in order to ease this process.p  pImagine I have a Customer that has many Orders.

Perhaps a simple headline with the customer name and phone number, then a list of orders.

Negative 4190 pI already asked a similar question some time ago in the following thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1936107fittingagausscurvetoacertainhistogrampeakincprevious threada. Until now I unfortunately couldnt entirely solve that issue and only worked around. Since it is difficult to include all the new information with the previous thread I post a refined and extended question with distinct context here and link it to the old thread.p  pI am currently implementing an algorithm from a a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocsummarydoi10.1.1.102.1192 relnofollowpapera which extracts certain regions of a 3D data set by dynamically identifying value ranges in the data sets histogram. In a simplified way the method could be described as followingp  ol liFind the highest peak in the histogramli liFit a gaussian to the peakli liUsing the value range defined by the gaussians mean  deviation certain regions of the histogram are identified, and the voxels 3D pixels of these regions are removed from the original histogram.li liAs a result of the previous step a new highest peak should be revealed, based on which the steps 13 can be repeated. The steps are repeated until the data set histogram is empty.li ol  pMy questions relate to step 1 and 2 of the above description which is described as following in the paper The highest peak is identified and a Gaussian curve is fitted to its shape. The Gaussian is described by its midpoint , height h and deviation . The fitting process minimizes the accumulated height difference between the histogram and the middle part of the Gaussian. The error summation range is   a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocsummarydoi10.1.1.102.1192 relnofollow1ap  pIn the following I will ask my questions and add my reflections on themp  ol liHow should I identify those bins of the total histogram which describe the highest peak In order to identify its apex I simply run through the histogram and store the index of the bin with the highest frequency. But how far should the extend of the peak reach to the left and right of the highest bin. At the moment I simply go the the left and right of the highest bin for as long as the next bin is smaller as the previous one. However this is usually a very small range, since there occur creases mini peaks in the histogram. I already thought about smoothing the histogram. But I would have to that after each iteration since the subtraction of voxels step 3 in the description above can cause the histogram to contain creases again. And I am also worried that the repeated smoothing distorts the results.  Therefore I would like to ask whether there is an efficient way to detect the extend of a peak which is better than my current approach. There have been suggestions about mixture models and deconvolution in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1936107fittingagausscurvetoacertainhistogrampeakincprevious threada. However are these methods really reasonable if the shape of the histogram constantly changes after each iterationli liHow can I fit a gauss curve to the identified peak so that the accumulated hight difference between the histogram and middle part of the gaussian is minimized According to question one from the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1936107fittingagausscurvetoacertainhistogrampeakincprevious threada I fitted the curve to a given range of histogram bins by computing their mean and deviation I hope this is correct. But how do I minimize the accumulated hight difference between the histogram and middle part of the gaussian from this pointli ol  pThank you for your help Regards Marcp

Negative 4190 pI have read a hrefhttpnhforge.orgwikishowtonhlocalizationtechniques.aspx relnofollowfew good articlesa about NHibernate localization but nothing seems to fit this scenario very well. Our DB stores localized info with the following patternp  precodeTABLE NAME PRODUCT COLUMNS  ID PRODUCTCODE PRODUCTNAME DESCRIPTION1 DESCRIPTION2 DESCRIPTION3 codepre  pThe fields DESCRIPTION1, DESCRIPTION2 and DESCRIPTION3 contain the localized description of the product. There is always exactly three localized strings and the number always refers to the same culture for example 3 is English. In some other tables we have columns like NAME1, NAME2 and NAME3.p  pI would like to use Fluent NHibernate to map to these columns in a such way that the modelclass would contain only one property called Description and it would contain the value obtained from the correct field, based on the current threads culture.

Negative 4190 pI am using a codeCATransitioncode to shuffle codeCALayercodes in and out of a codeUIViewcode the codeUIViewcode isnt fullscreen.  The new layer enters from the right and the old layer leaves to the left.  The codeCAlayercodes have their contents properties set to codeCGImageRefcodes.  Here is what I believe to be the pertinent codep  precodeCATransition transition  [CATransition animation]  transition.duration  transitionTime transition.timingFunction  [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithNamekCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut]  transition.type  kCATransitionPush transition.subtype  kCATransitionFromRight  transition.delegate  self [view.layer addAnimationtransition forKeynil]   onDeck is the layer stageright and is about to enter [view.layer addSublayeronDeck]       onStage is the layer currently in the middle of the view and is exiting if onStage    [onStage removeFromSuperlayer] codepre  pThis animation occurs, there is a 1 second pause, and then a new image is animated in etc, etc.  This works beautifully in the simulator but on my 2nd generation iPod Touch, there are occasional hiccups in the animation.  Specifically, the layer being animated in will flicker on top of the currently displayed layer.  These flickers are not consistent but are noticeable.p  pWhat Ive narrowed down to be the likely culprits are the background animations I have going on behind this transition.  There are a few dozen codeCAlayercodes flying in and out of the fullscreen view in the background.  When I remove these background animations or set the animation duration for the transition to a much higher duration 2 seconds  the animation performs fine Id like the animation time to be 0.75 seconds.p  pMy first thought which seems to be backed up by the above observations is that I am pushing CoreAnimation at least for my iPod too hard and need to compromise.  Why I am having trouble accepting this is that the scene renders very nicely little to no lag aside from this occasional flicker.  p  pIf anyone has any input on this issue, or CoreAnimation optimization in general, Id be very much appreciativep  pThanks for reading   p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHad a chance to test this on an iPhone 4 and the flickering never occurred.

Negative 4190 pIm following the example in Lucene in Action, pages 308315, which describes Lucene Spatial. Im using lucene 2.9.4. Ive used a hrefhttpgeocoder.usservicedistancehttpgeocoder.usservicedistancea endpoint to calculate the distance between some locations, and then written unit tests to verify that the index can find locations within a given radius. p  pIm wondering how accurate I can expect lucene to be. For example, if I give radius 10.0 and the distance between my latlon points is 9.99 miles, will it be able to find this location in all casesp  pThe thing that is prompting this question is that Ive found the search to be very accurate for small radius values e.g. 10.0 or less and inaccurate for larger values r25.0 for example. p  pIs there anything I might be doing wrong Is it possible that the searcher will select a tier that does not have all the latlongs for a given radius My understanding was that it selects the smallest tier that is guaranteed to have all the points within the radius, i.e. the tier algorigthm is just an optimization.p  pEDIT Also I found this a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseLUCENE2519httpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseLUCENE2519a and the apparently fixed code here a hrefhttpcode.google.compspatialsearchlucenesourcebrowsetrunksrcmainjavaorgapachelucenespatialtierprojectionSinusoidalProjector.javar38httpcode.google.compspatialsearchlucenesourcebrowsetrunksrcmainjavaorgapachelucenespatialtierprojectionSinusoidalProjector.javar38a, but when I patched my code to use the fixed SinusoidalProjector my index returns zero ads in all cases.p  pAnd this does not give me much confidence p  pa hrefhttpwww.lucidimagination.comblog20100720updatespatialsearchinapacheluceneandsolrhttpwww.lucidimagination.comblog20100720updatespatialsearchinapacheluceneandsolrap  pa hrefhttpwww.lucidimagination.comsearchdocumentc32e81783642df47spatialrethinkingcartesiantiersimplementationc32e81783642df47httpwww.lucidimagination.comsearchdocumentc32e81783642df47spatialrethinkingcartesiantiersimplementationc32e81783642df47ap  pIt seems to indicate that hacks exist throughout the code and simply patching SinusoidalProjector is not enough.p

If I do this, however, I would have to make a different module for each function, and If I want to use them all in a program, I would have a very long USE declaration list not to mention the number of .mod files that would be produced.  p  pThe only possible solution for this I could come up with, was to make another module with just the USE declarations for all other modules, but I think there must be another way to have a library containing functions that is not so far fetched.p  hr  pEDIT Also, why is it that I have this problem with functions but not with subroutines Is it because the command CALL immediately identifies the line as a subroutine call whereas functions are called just by name with no command to tell the compiler hey, this is a function, so it has to know what is a function and what not beforehandp  hr  pEDIT2 I am including an example following the instructions in a hrefhttpwww.oceanographers.netforumsshowthread.php378HowtomakeaFORTRANlibrary relnofollowhttpwww.oceanographers.netforumsshowthread.php378HowtomakeaFORTRANlibrarya, and using the correct path.  p  pTestFunc.F90p  precodeFUNCTION SumNumnNum1,nNum2 RESULTnResult   IMPLICIT NONE   INTEGER,INTENTIN  nNum1,nNum2   INTEGER             nResult    nResultnNum1nNum2    RETURNEND FUNCTION   codepre  pTestProg.F90p  precodePROGRAM TestProg   IMPLICIT NONE    WRITE6, SumNum2,2    STOPEND PROGRAM   codepre  pCommand Linep  precodegt gfortran c TestFunc.F90 o TestFunc.o   gt ar ruv libmylib.a .o   gt gfortran TestProg.F90 o Test.x Lpath lmylib.a  TestProg.F906.12        WRITE6, SumNum2,2                  1   Error Function sumnum at 1 has no IMPLICIT type   codepre

Negative 4190 pAssume you have a sha1 algorithm that accepts text as input instead of a byte array.  For instance there are some Javascript libraries like that.p  pWhen you would like to apply sha1 to a text lets say the text is a password, then you first do a utf8 encoding because the text can contain multibyte characters. In other words, the corresponding integer value of a character in the text can be larger than an 8bit byte can hold. Since the sha1 algorithm works on 8bit units, it helps to encode the text in utf8 first.p  pMy question is this When you have a nontextual binary data where the value of each byte is between 0 and 255, are you still expected to do utf8 encoding on the binary data before you pass it to the sha1 algorithm I know that when the values are between 0 and 127, utf8 does not modify the data at all.p  pHowever, if the values are between 128 and 255, the UTF8 modifies such data.p  pIn summary, here is my question What is SHA1 of the byte containing the value 255 all 1sp  precodeWith UTF8 encoding    730cf30d408ecf51aad876f5c491f837f7ddea4c  Without UTF8 encoding 85e53271e14006f0265921d02d4d736cdc580b0b codepre  pWhich one is the right onep

Negative 4190 pI have a product that currently supports ARMV6 and ARMV7, meaning iPhone 3G is supported.  However, it is our goal to migrate to straight ARMV7 architecture to reduce binary size, and resolve some build errors we have with certain ARMV7 only libraries that we are linking against.  However, we do not want to totally leave 3G users in the dark, and allow them to download the lower version that still supports their hardware.  My question is thisp  pDoes anyone know what the App Store behavior either documented or anecdotal for this sort of upgrade is  p  pI know that 3G users will stil be able to use the application if they have it, and that upgrading to the new ARMV7 version will be disallowed... but what about users that have to reinstall on the 3G device  Will the store allow them to download the older version, or will it just tell them to get new hardwarep

Negative 4190 pI am about to start a project that I hope will some day require the capacity for scaling. The key question for me is should I invest the effort to design for this eventuality now, or should I cross that bridge when I get therep  pI know how these things go everyone thinks their project might scale, but most projects never do.p  pIs there a set of best practices that will allow you to scale more easily at a later stage, while not investing too much in something that may never be neededp  pObviously I have no experience with scalable web sites. Currently I am leaning towards Scala  Play  Akka. From what I can glean from the Akka website, it is very suitable for this kind of project in that it provides a toolset that allows development on a single machine and scaling out to an arbitrary number of machines.p  pThe project is a consumerfacing web site that involves some user interaction comments, messages, voting etc.. The main focus is editorial, though. Its no Facebook p  pNot being experienced in any of these technologies my experience mainly coming from PHP, AS3, ObjectiveC, I probably have a little too much on my plate right now. But then I am not going to go at it right away. I am aware that I need to get some experience using Scala and Play first.p  pAny advice is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4190 pThis is a similar problem to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2822746forcingatransactiontorollbackonvalidationerrorsinseamForcing a transaction to rollback on validation errora  The scenario is this A user edits a page, the transaction is set to MANUAL so only if we call flush it would be committed to the database. Now the user wants to cancel the changes. Easy as you havent flushed it yet.p  pNow consider this scenario User edits page with lots of ajax on there. Some of these ajax callbacks require database queries e.g. using a richFaces suggestion box etc. Some validation is done as well that requires database lookups. The problem is Hibernate will automatically issue a flush when you do a query. So the user doesnt press the save button which would flush the transaction he presses the cancel button. What do you do nowp  pIf you dont do anything the changes will be written to the database  not what the user expects.p  pYou can throw an exception that is annotated with p  precodeApplicationExceptionrollbacktrue codepre  pThat would rollback the transaction. You can then redirect to another page. However here Ive come across another problem, on some pages you redirect to you get a lazy initialisation exception. Ive specified  p  precodeltexception classcom.mycomp.BookingCancelExceptiongt     ltendconversation beforeredirecttruegt       ltredirect viewidsecureBookings.xhtmlgt         ltmessage severityINFOgtmessages[cancel.rollback]ltmessagegt     ltredirectgt ltexceptiongt codepre  pin pages.xml, so the conversation should end before we are doing the redirect. A new conversation should start with a new transaction but that doesnt seem to happen in all cases Whyp  pIve read somewhere else that you can simply usep  precodeTransaction.instance.rollback codepre  pThis would be preferable as you dont have to go via exceptions the redirect always takes long when Seam handles exceptions but the problem is that the Transaction isnt actually rolled back. I couldnt figure out why. If I check the status of the transaction it says that it is not in rollback state.p  pHow would you best handle Cancel requests. The pure MANUAL flush doesnt work in this case. You could work with detached entities but the page contains several linked entities so this is getting messy.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive now discovered that throwing the ApplicationException doesnt rollback the transaction in all cases. So rather confused now.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Of course rolling back transactions will not work when you have an page where you use ajax to update values. Each transaction only covers one request. So if you do e.g. 5 edits with ajax request, rolling back a transaction will only roll back the changes from the last ajax request and not from the earlier 4 ones.p  pSo solution is really to use the flush mode MANUAL.p  pThere are a few things that will cause a flush even if you specify MANUAL.p  ul lia query in an ajax request can trigger a flush  Use setFlushModeFlushMode.COMMIT on the query to avoid this.li liPersisting an entity can trigger a flush depending on the ID generation used e.g. if you use the strategy IDENTITY. You can work around this by using Cascades. If you need to create entities during the edit which dont have any real relationship with the main entity your are editing just add them to a list and persist all entities in that list when you do a save.li liWhen you start a nested conversation or another bean joins the conversation the Flush Mode on that session is set back to AUTO when you dont specify Beginjointrue,flushModeFlushModeType.MANUALli ul  pYou might want to specify MANUAL as the default mode in components.xmlp  precodeltcoremanager concurrentrequesttimeout10000   conversationidparametercid conversationtimeout600000 defaultflushmodeMANUALgt codepre

Negative 4190 pIm building web portal in ASP.NET MVC 3 that uses distant web service as only way to communicate with database. Web service has requirement to always have UsernamePassword passed in request header, otherwise it rejects the call.p  pI have overridden ASP.NET Membership so that my ValidateUser method sends UsernamePassword to web service Login method, and returns truefalse if authentication is successful. It works quite nice with AcountController provided with MVC 3 Empty internet template. Since I have to pass UsernamePassword on every web service call, Im saving them in Session.p  pMy problem isp  pIf I close browser and reopen it... I remain logged to website, but my Session variables are expired, so none of my requests to web service are being accepted, even though Im still logged with credentials.p  pIm looking for nice suggestion how to sync user logged in state with session state. Either to keep them both persistent until log off is used or to have them both dispose on browser being closed.p  pThanks for all suggestions p

Negative 4190 pI tried to copy and paste a component from one data module into another in Delphi XE2. The component was a Fast Report data source link component.

The page you are reading is the documentation for ClassGroup.p  pSo, the first time I even learn this exists is when it blocks me from copy and pasting components into my data module from an existing set of designtime building blocks that I didnt wish to rebuild from scratch.p  pOnce I change the data module affinity, I can paste stuff into data modules without it bugging me.  Thank goodness for Googlethaterror or Id be stuck.p  pIf it is intended to help us write cross platform data modules, and yet it only affects the IDE, according to the documentation, thats inconsistent with the warning that you get when you play with this at designtime, heres the error you get if you change itp  precode EInvalidType  The following components are not available in the specified   class group.

Curious minds who want to know whats really going on, want to know What is this thing about and why did it get added to the data modules in XE2.  I anticipate other people will stumble  upon this weird feature, with the feeling that theyve stepped in something like dinosaur droppings, and want to know what is up with this feature.p  pMy best answer at this point is that a data module affinity for TPersistent which means, in XE2 lingo, that this data module doesnt want nonvisual controls in it, that are VCLspecific. In a future version of Delphi, perhaps a similar marker would allow us to mark forms as being clean of dependencies on the VCL or windows toop  pUpdate 1 The .PAS source code of your data module stores this pseudoproperty in a way that looks a bit like a compiler directive, like thisp  precodeimplementation  CLASSGROUP Vcl.Controls.TControl codepre

Negative 4190 pI have used MVC to create several sites from scratch, but now I am tasked with a migration project.p  pCurrently the site has a large static file base .html. Eventually every page will be migrated to MVC with views and controllers. The site lends itself to conversion very well with few nested folders and each folder with several pages. This should be a fairly straight forward job. But business dictates this must be done incrementally folder by folder, this is OK as each folder is fairly self contained and very few links go to other folders.p  pMy question is can I just import the entire existing site into a folder named codelegacyhtmlcode in my VS project then configure routing to essentially ignore this folder, preserving the current site navigation for users.p  pAs I migrate each folder, the folder would be deleted from legacyhtml and controller and views be created.p  pThe reason I ask is there are many root level folders and given eventually they will be all be migrated to controllers and views, I dont want them cluttering the project and getting in my way.

Negative 4190 pA critical bugfix update to one of my apps was recently rejected due to an alleged violation of the iCloud Data Storage Guidelines.p  pHeres how my app stores data hasnt been a problem since the first version of my app was approved in 2009p  ol liOn startup, it copies a starter SQLite3 database from the app bundle to the Documents folder.li liThe database contains the basic schema and some example data so the user can see how to use the app. Its small  just under 3MB.li liThe users future work is then saved only in this database file. They may delete or keep the samples, they may add tons of their own data, but that database file will always be there.li ol  pAn update earlier this year was rejected for the same reason, but when I gave them the explanation above, the app status changed from Rejected to In Review to Processing for App Store. They didnt send me any explanation, so I thought it was just a misunderstanding on the reviewers part.p  pThis time, the reviewer responded to my explanation by simply saying that nonusergenerated data shouldnt be stored in iCloud and my update remains in the Rejected state.p  pBut I dont understand what Im supposed to do here. Because all of the users work is kept in the database, its not an option for me to exclude this from iCloud backup or store it in a Cache folder. Also, I cant really cleanly separate usergenerated from nonusergenerated data because the app works from the same database file. The initial, nonusergenerated data will be quickly replaced with the users own data, though the filename and directory location of the database will remain the same.p  pAnd even if there were no sample data in the database, any databasebacked app will still have to generate an empty database when it starts  even if the only thing it holds is the apps database schema.p  pThis must be a very common problem, but unfortunately its not okay for me to just turn off backup  users put a lot of work into the data they store in my app, and iCloud backup is very important to them.p  pWhat options do I have at this point Heres what I can seep  ol lipContact Apple again and try to explain whats going on.pli lipCan I set the files backup attribute to NO and then only toggle it to YES when the user makes their first change Is that okay technically and okay with Applepli lipRemove my example data from the database. This will be really bad for usability and will increase my support load, but Im willing to do it if it will get my update approved. However, Ill still have to create a stub database at startup to hold the empty database schema, so Im not sure if that will even make a difference in the approval process.pli lipCry.pli ol  pAnyone have any advice I have to imagine that there are lots of other apps that use a database the same way mine does, but dont have the option of just disabling backup. p  pIts also very depressing that any changes I make will require another round of testing and app review, which will set back my critical update an additional 2  3 weeks. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong There may be another option can I simply save the file in codeLibrarycode instead of codeDocumentscode, since their problem seems to be specifically with the use of the Documents folder Will the file be backed up if its stored in codeLibrarycodep  pstrongUPDATE 2strong The thing I find most confusing is that any databasebacked app even if it uses Core Data, I assume will have to create a database file containing at least the apps schema.

Also, the example data consists of starter images, which the user will probably end up deleting as they start using the app.p

Negative 4190 pWith exactly i mean preserving holes in sparse files and all extended attributes catching situations where the target file system does not support them or not fully for example different EA lengths And on mounted NTFS filesystems it should work with alternate streams too. Preserving as much file attributes as possible.p  pNeed callbacks for progress GUI too. This seems to be difficult an maintenance hell, so i guess there is something already useable like the SHFileOperation on Windows.p  pI looked at GLIB and they are doing it in the most simple way with openreadwriteclose sequence.p

Negative 4190 pI am currently making a game in java using slick2D. The game is tile based and I am trying to make the random map generation. I am generating a room and the a hallway attached to that room and keep doing that until the map is all filled up. I have methods such as p  precodegenerateRoomint x, int y, int width, int height codepre  pMy question is how do I pass in the type of Tile that I want to use in the room. I thought it could look something like thisp  precodegenerateRoomStoneTile, int x, int y, int width, int height codepre  pObviously this does not work. I do not want to send in an actual tile that has already been created because each tile has a specific location in it and when calling the method I do not know the location of the tiles. How would I just send in the type that is to be used in the methodp

Negative 4190 pI am trying to delete sections contained within a heading from a Word document using VBA code. A section, in my situation, refers to a listing in the Navigation Pane on the left side of the screen. p  pFor example, I would search for a top level heading of Introduction, and delete it, then the next top level heading would be Body with three subsections below it. I would select the Body section and delete it. Its all very easy to do within Word itself, but I would like to do it through VBA. I have tried recording a macro while deleting from the Navigation Pane, but it doesnt record anything.p  pEdit alternately, being able to use VBA to highlight the heading, and everything below it and up to a heading of equal or greater size, would also work.p  pAny ideas or suggestions are greatly appreciated, thanksp

Negative 4190 pI recently shifted from Python runtime version 2.5 to 2.7 while developing a web app on Google App Engine, and I notice that in many cases when a script runs into an error, the stack trace isnt shown any more. With runtime Python 2.5 this is the stack trace in the browserp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comx1GaA.jpg altError tracebacks on Python 2.5p  pThe emPython 2.7.2em on the top right is because I have that version of python installed on my machine. Changing the runtime to codepython27code does this to the traceback for the same errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwOzun.jpg altNo error tracebacks on Python 2.7p  pThe 2.7 runtime works fine otherwise, however, and I am also able to use 2.7specific libraries. Ive noticed that errors in the python code that cause this behaviour have nothing to do with the capabilities of the runtime version. I think this happens at least with faulty GQL syntax in the python script, but also with other errors.p  pFor the time being Im reverting to 2.5 whenever I get the second picture, fixing the problem, then going back to 2.7, but pretty soon this wont be possible because most of my code will rely on 2.7 functionality. strongSo how do I get the nice detailed error traceback of Python 2.5 to show on the 2.7 runtime as wellstrongp

Here is the code I am using to connect..p  precode    WifiConfiguration wc  new WifiConfiguration     wc.allowedAuthAlgorithms.clear     wc.allowedGroupCiphers.clear     wc.allowedPairwiseCiphers.clear     wc.allowedProtocols.clear     wc.allowedKeyManagement.clear     wc.SSID  .concatltssidgt.concat     wc.preSharedKey  .concatltpasswordgt.concat     wc.allowedGroupCiphers.setWifiConfiguration.GroupCipher.TKIP     wc.allowedGroupCiphers.setWifiConfiguration.GroupCipher.CCMP     wc.allowedGroupCiphers.setWifiConfiguration.GroupCipher.WEP40     wc.allowedGroupCiphers.setWifiConfiguration.GroupCipher.WEP104     wc.allowedKeyManagement.setWifiConfiguration.KeyMgmt.WPAPSK     wc.allowedPairwiseCiphers.setWifiConfiguration.PairwiseCipher.CCMP     wc.allowedPairwiseCiphers.setWifiConfiguration.PairwiseCipher.TKIP     wc.allowedProtocols.setWifiConfiguration.Protocol.RSN  For WPA2     wc.allowedProtocols.setWifiConfiguration.Protocol.WPA  For WPA     wc.priority  0     wc.hiddenSSID  true     wc.status  WifiConfiguration.Status.ENABLED      connect to and enable the connection     WifiManager wifiManager  WifiManager getSystemServicethis.WIFISERVICE     int netId  wifiManager.addNetworkwc     boolean wifiEnabled  wifiManager.enableNetworknetId, true     wifiManager.setWifiEnabledtrue     Log.dopener, addNetwork returned   netId     if netId gt 0          wifiId  netId      codepre  pHowever netId is always 1. I have tried it on two different phones ICSHTC Rezound  and GingerBreadMotorola DroidX. Both show exactly same results. What am I doing wrong p  pEdit I tried same code with WPA2 access point and got very weird results. When this code was run, first time it would return 1, but if I call same method second time with a delay of 1 second, it would return valid netId. So the questions arep  ol liwhy does above code not connect to wpa li liin wpa2, why do I need to call above method twice to get connected  Edit i observed that I had to connect multiple times to get connected. Sometimes it would take 34 times to connect. So for now I am looping until adding config returns 0 id.li ol

My idea was to make the file upload button I had already hidden, and use Javascript to set its value to the path of the draganddropped image when the user tries to submit.p  pHowever, when I try to submit I get the error File name too long  publicdatadataimagejpegbase64,9j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPsABFEdWNreQABAAQAAABkAAD4QMtaHR0cDovL25zLmFkb2JlLmNvbS94YXAvMS4wLwA8P3hwYWNj.... because the temporary file storage name given by HTML5 is just too long, I guess. I tried concatenating the string to the first 60 characters and then it gave the error No such file or directory  publicdatadataimagejpegbase64,9j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

Negative 4190 pIve recently started using a hrefhttpsoftware.intel.comenusintelippIntel Performance Primitives IPPa for image processing.

My OpenCV code always uses the codecvMatcode image data structure. However, based on the IPP code samples, it seems that IPP prefers the a hrefhttpwww.codeforge.comread116995ippiImage.hhtmlcodeCIppiImagecodea data structure. p  pMy system does several image transformations in OpenCV, then I want to do a couple of things in IPP, then do more work in OpenCV.

Negative 4190 pIve been hacking up a raytracer for the first time over the past few days. However, there are a few quirks which bother me and I dont really know how to work out. One that has been there since the beginning is the shape of spheres in the scene  when rendered, they actually look like ovals. Of course, there is perspective in the scene, but the final shape still seems odd. I have attached a sample rendering, the problem I have is especially visible on the reflective sphere in the lower left part of the image.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd02ec.png altSample Imagep  pI dont really know what could be causing this.

Negative 4190 pIm using MongoDB in my project for statistical and data analysis things. My goal is design data to have best performance and scaleability.p  pLets assume I have several shops and a list of unique products per shop. And I need to query some data about the products, calculate some basic statistic only by curtain shop.p  pWhich way is better from the performance point of view to have a Shop document and a list of products inside and then make querying only per this document.p  pOr better will be having separate collection with all products per all shops in it and then build queries for that collectionp  hr  pMaybe the question itself does mongodb could query through the body of one document with such efficient manner like through many documents.p  hr  pstrongUPD 1strong For now lets assuming that products itself is quite small Id, Price, Name, Count and the amount of it is limited.

Negative 4190 pI think I will understand this concept better if someone can assist me in a current project that Im working on.  I want to use C to edit data at specific memory addresses, using pointers.  Specifically, I have two character arrays strings which I need to both read data from at specific locations, and also write to at specific locations.p  pIm mostly confused about syntax of pointers, such as codecode and codegtcode and codeampcode.  p  pFrom my understanding, the codecode refers to the data kept at the current memory address of the pointer.  So, for example, if I wanted to edit the data at the beginning memory address of a codechar pcode, I would do something like    codep  ccodep  pNow, what if I wanted do to alter a character at the em2ndem memory address from the beginning of codepcode  p  pAlso, I understand that codeampcode refers to the location of the pointer.  But I dont know how to use this syntax.  p  pHere is my examplep  precode   int origlength  strlenoriginalstring 1 for 0 char poriginal, pnewstring  poriginal  amporiginalstring   whileoriglengthgt0   k  0  j  0  whileisalphaporiginalj      j    k    whilek gt 0     pnewstringjk  toupperporiginalk1 toupper    k    ifporiginalj        pnewstringj        else     pnewstringj  poriginalj     origlength  origlength  j  pnewstringstrlenpnewstring  0 Syn Is this actually necessary  ... program continues... codepre  pBy the way, this program is meant to take one string nowiunderstand and reverse each word, capitalize each word, switch  to  , and leave other punctuation alone  WON I DNATSREDNUp
Negative 4190 pSo two questions here really. First, and yes, I have searched this already, but wanted clarification, what is the difference between a user thread and a kernel thread Is it simply that one is generated by a user program and the other by an OS, with the latter having access to privileged instructions Are they conceptually the same or are there actual differences in the threads themselvesp  pSecond, and the real problem of my question is the book I am using says that a relationship must exist between user threads and kernel threads, going on to list the different models of such a relationship. But the book fails to clearly explain strongwhystrong a user thread strongmust alwaysstrong be mapped to a specific kernel thread. Why is thisp

Negative 4190 pAs the title says, why I want to go about being able to transfer or save my c form project in such a manner that I can still open it at different locations. Im aware that conflicting frameworks or Visual Studio versions will prevent this from happening, although I can assure that both my .NET and VS versions are the same about both residences. p  pIn general, I have an error where visual studio will open the project, however, when I want to edit any portion of my form, I notice that all files under Form1.CS including From1.CS have a lock and  cannot be found. I realize that the project follows a path in which these files are notable to the IDE, is there a way I can go and direct Visual Studio to these missing files Or perhaps is there measures I need to invoke prior to saving my project on my original PCp  pI am approaching the end of my first programming year and I would like to clarify any errors that I may be held accountable for, or anything I can do to prevent such errors so that I dont have similar confrontations later. Im quite aware after researching similiar claims that the complexity of what I need to accomplish may be beyond my current understanding. Nevertheless, help is help indeed, and I will attempt to make the best of it that I can.p  pAlso, I have exported templates with no luck as the zipped file still does not contain my form files.p

Negative 4190 pI am developing a Cocoa App for OSX to allow users place bets on several games we offer. I have set up a webservice which returns an XML with the daily rates for betting, and what my App should do, for every user, isp  ul liKeep track of updates in the XML in the background, and update the locally stored rates when necessaryli liAllow users to place bets on any available game, with the current rateli liSome more helper options to help the user construct the betting pack, irrelevant by nowli liEvery user ends up placing n bets for an x amount in each oneli ul  pSo far, Ive written some code to retrieve the data from the XML, and insert it into my modelled Core Data objects. It works.p  pMy question is if I want my users to have access to past bets, I need to keep the old data when updating the rates, so the old bets can relate to the old rates. Could this lead into a storage problem if, lets say during 2 or 3 years, I release rate 20 updates per day, and a certain user is very active This would mean 3 million different rates per yearp  pI guess this must be too much, maybe I should store the applied rates manually into the bet objectp  pNow, if the solution is deleting the old rates with every update, how can I delete only a part of the NSManagedObjectContext Should I use two different contexts one for the users and their bets and another one for the current rates or maybe the 10 lastp  pOne last question as you see, Im quite new to Cocoa, and specially to Core Data Where should I handle the checkForXmlUpdates, so it doesnt interfere with the app initialization What I mean is the server could be slow, I want the app to load the last Core Data objects by default, and then update in the background if necessary.p

Negative 4190 pWhen implementing a stop and copy garbage collector as a pair, I need two memory banks the old one and a free new one. One memory bank consists of thecars and thecdrs. So basicly when I make a new addres, it is a pointer to thecars and thecdrs.p  pWhen allocating new memory and I see that I dont have enough space, I start a GC. What this one does is p  ul liswitch the memory banksli limove read car and cdr from the old bank, copy to the new bank and put a pointer in the old bank to the new for later. li liscan loops over the memory and copies everything from old to new.li ul  pNow the question is Why do I need to scan first and move after. Why cant I do both togetherp

Negative 4190 pI have a view that has a navigation bar on the top, 4 buttons in the middle for the menu, and a tab bar navigation on the bottom.p  pWhen only the tab bar items are used everything works, but when I load one of the views via the button the view remains when the tab bar item is pressed.p  pIm new to ios so I may not be explaining it that well.

I could be out to lunch on this.p  pPlease let me know how to make the home button on the tab bar load the initial view even if one of the buttons were pressed to load another view.p  pHeres what my storyboard looks like.

I attempted to set the tab bar controller delegate via the app delegate as per some QA on stackoverflow but it didnt seem to make a difference.   There is another approach I should be taking if I want to have a main home screen with buttons to various sections and those sections have a navigation and Tab bar controllers p

Negative 4190 pI am having trouble with my call to getWritableDatabase. It is returning a NullPointerException. The thing that is strangest is that this error only began occurring after I commented out a couple lines of code in my android manifest. Now the project is back to where it was I uncommented those sections and it still throws a NullPointerException. So I checked my context and tried this.getBaseContext and this.getApplicationContext. p  pUsing getApplicationContext puts this out to logcatp  precode0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to instantiate service com.productivity.uptimeapp.NetService java.lang.NullPointerException 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleCreateServiceActivityThread.java2395 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.app.ActivityThread.access1600ActivityThread.java139 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1313 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5021 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java789 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java556 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.content.ContextWrapper.getApplicationContextContextWrapper.java101 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at com.productivity.uptimeapp.NetService.ltinitgtNetService.java45 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at java.lang.Class.newInstanceImplNative Method 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at java.lang.Class.newInstanceClass.java1319 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleCreateServiceActivityThread.java2392 0812 092420.042 EAndroidRuntime5572     ... 10 more codepre  pUsing getBaseContext puts this out to logcatp  precode0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to instantiate service com.productivity.uptimeapp.NetService java.lang.NullPointerException 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleCreateServiceActivityThread.java2395 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.app.ActivityThread.access1600ActivityThread.java139 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1313 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5021 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java789 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java556 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper.getDatabaseLockedSQLiteOpenHelper.java224 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabaseSQLiteOpenHelper.java164 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at com.productivity.uptimeapp.NetService.ltinitgtNetService.java46 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at java.lang.Class.newInstanceImplNative Method 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at java.lang.Class.newInstanceClass.java1319 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleCreateServiceActivityThread.java2392 0812 092857.058 EAndroidRuntime5833     ... 10 more codepre  pHere is my relevant NetService Code.

Negative 4190 pIve been turning my head around trying to get two iPhones to exchange public keysthat are both generated on the devices.

Negative 4190 pHi I have a very weird issue with Wordpress 3.5 Varnish 3.02 and Ubuntu where the visual editor has disappeared. The buttons to switch between the htmlvisual has disappeared and only the html editor is showing. The site is caching fine, no javascript error and no error in apache log. Varnish is listening on 80 and Apache on 8080. Everything else work fine except the editor. When I bypass varnish the editor switch buttons appear and work fine. Here is what I have done so far without success  All plugins disabled  Switched to Default theme  Checked firebug for any jquery error NONE  Bypassed Varnish Everything works fine  Purged Varnish cache No luck  Reuploaded all default wordpress files  Switched to an earlier version of Wordpress 3.5 What do you think might be the problem I have been scratching my head for a week now on this issue.p  pVCL FILE p  precode backend default      .host  x.x.x.x     .port  8080      sub vclrecv     if req.http.host  mydomain.com      set req.http.xRedirUrl  httpwww.anotherdomain.comspecificfolder     error 750 req.http.xRedirUrl        include devicedetect.vcl   Called after a document has been successfully retrieved from the backend. sub vclrecv      call devicedetect        Allow the backend to serve up stale content if it is responding slowly.     set req.grace  2m       Always cache the following file types for all users.     if  req.url  i.pnggifjpegjpgicoswfcssjshtmlhtm[az09]               unset req.http.cookie            Dont serve cached pages to logged in users     if  req.http.cookie  wordpressloggedin  req.url  vaultpresstrue               return pass             Drop any cookies sent to WordPress.     if    req.url  wploginadmin                unset req.http.cookie            Handle compression correctly.

Negative 4190 pIs there any implemented functionprocedure in Oracle 11g to simply transform a standard normalized table into a nested table Or does someone has an idea for the following problemp  pReason All of our tables are normalized in a way that if a certain attribute value is set twice or more for one record the whole record except this attribute valuehas to be stored redundant. Meaning, if I have in my person table an attribute IDCARDNUMBER and one person has two nationalities and two ID cards there is a second record with redundant attribute values except IDCARDNUMBER. Outsourcing such an attribute in an extra table is NOT an option and I also dont want to denormalize in a way that one attribute value consists of a concatenation of prior, separated attribute values.p

All of the stuff is done, like SOLR schema, search queries, faceted search etc. I tried to develop a cxf web service that returns a list of SolrDocument. Everything is OK until I try to make the return type of the service function as SolrDocument. I know that CXF does not generate return types for java objects that does not have an empty constructor. For SolrDocument object is this the case Besides, I succeeded to return complex java object types with CXF. For returning SolrDocument as an object what is your proposed solutions p  pAn idea that came to my mind was to create my own Document object and convert SolrDocument to that type but it is expensive since I already have the search results as SolrDocument.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 4190 pIdeally Id like to accomplish two goalsp  ol liPass the codeCameracode preview data to a codeMediaCodeccode encoder via a codeSurfacecode.  I can create the codeSurfacecode using codeMediaCodec.createInputSurfacecode but the codeCamera.setPreviewDisplaycode takes a codeSurfaceHoldercode, not a codeSurfacecode.  li liIn addition to passing the codeCameracode preview data to the encoder, Id also like to display the preview onscreen so the user can actually see what they are encoding.  If the encoder wasnt involved then Id use a codeSurfaceViewcode, but that doesnt appear to work in this scenario since codeSurfaceViewcode creates its own codeSurfacecode and I think I need to use the one created by codeMediaCodeccode.li ol  pIve searched online quite a bit for a solution and havent found one.  Some examples on a hrefhttpbigflake.commediacodecbigflake.coma seem like a step in the right direction but they take an approach that adds a bunch of EGLSurfaceTexture overhead that Id like to avoid.  Im hoping there is a simpler example or solution where I can get the codeCameracode and codeMediaCodeccode talking more directly without involving EGL or textures.p

Negative 4190 pGetting this error frequently, even though theres no actual error. I know this because after a reboot the project builds work fine  for a while When constantly updating code and rerunning on emulator I have auto build set, the problem appears on average each 2030 minutes, which is maybe every 10th rerun a very rough average, its not regular. You can imagine how annoying it is. Ive read many posts and have tried many things but have not found the solution. If anyone can help Id very much appreciate it.p  pWhen I get the problem theres a cross on the project name but nowhere else. Cleaning the project removes the cross but I get the same error message when I try to runbuild it.p  pIve tried many suggestions found in stackoverflow and elsewherep  ul liProject clean, as mentioned, doesnt help, nor does Project clean followed by restarting Eclipse.li liDeleted amp recreated debug certificate but it didnt help.li liChecked Problems view only has warnings.li liTried Fix Project Properties then Project Clean.li liChecked windowpreferencesandroidsdklocation, which is correct.li liNo recent imports or even new files  only code changes.li liTested theory that it happens when an xml file is the active file in the editor  not true in my case.li liAnother idea was to delete the bin folder, but it wont let me I dont have the permission, which I normally do have  see below.li liAnother suggestion I saw was to delete the jars from libs folder, but that didnt help so I restored it.li liChecked the software versions even though same setup has worked fine for months.

The File Properties Security tab says To continue you must be an administrative user with permission to view this objects security properties. When I press Continue I see Unable to display current owner.

But it doesnt affect the line spacing in that paragraph. Not that it should, but then p  pThe next two paragraphs have codelineheight 150code. Again, the second paragraph has one word thats smaller. But this time, for reasons unclear, the smaller font creates extra space between the first two lines at least in Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Explorer. This is the original problem in my CSS that I was trying to fix. I speculate that it has something to do with the browser shrinking the word and then shifting it downward vertically to realign the baselines.p  pThe next two paragraphs have codelineheight 1.5emcode. My understanding is that code1.5emcode is the same as code150code.

Namely a unitless value is passed to the child element and its line height is calculated using the childs font size, whereas a percentage or em value will cause a line height to be calculated for the parent, and then that calculated value is passed to the child. But how does this account for the difference in behavior seen here Where is the extra space coming from If its a consequence of some CSS positioning rule, then what is that rulepli lipOr, if these examples should all render the same way, then which one is implemented incorrectly Note on Q2 The fact that the rendering quirk happens the same way across different browsers strongly suggests that none of them are implemented incorrectly, which will take you back to question 1.pli lipstrikeIn practical terms, is there a downside to switching to unitless measurements like code1.5code for codelineheightcodestrike Answer nopli ol

Negative 4190 pI need to layout several collections of buttons in a circle. I have found UICollectionView using a custom layout flow to be an easy way to accomplish this. Especially since each collection of buttons varies in number.p  pIn addition, this wheel of buttons needs to rotate albeit slowly like a ferris wheel. That is, each cell maintains its orientation while the wheel rotates. So I have added a CAKeyFrameAnimation to each uicollectionviewcell.p  pThe problem is now that I have lost the ability to select a cell while it is moving. Which is of course, because the cell is actually still at its original location, only the presentation layer is animated.p  pIve seen suggestions for adding hittests to keyframe animated views, but doing this to a collectionviewcell seems to completely nullify the point of using a uicollectionview. And it feels like going down a rathole.p  pAm I missing something here I feel like I should ditch UICollectionViews altogether for this application and use simple uiviews and hitTesting on the CALayer. Unfortunately though I have to reinvent many of the conveniences of collection views.p

Negative 4190 pIm writing an application that periodically approximately once per second collects some data from a hardware device and displays it in a graph using matplotlib. The user will periodically click on the graph, and when that happens I need to know the emxem and emyem coordinates of the click, as measured in the graphs coordinate system.p  pThis is easy enough to do if codecanvascode is a codeFigureCanvascode instance, you can sayp  precodecanvas.mplconnectbuttonreleaseevent, mouseuphandler codepre  pand definep  precodedef mouseuphandlerevent     printThe user clicked at , .formatevent.xdata, event.ydata codepre  pto show the click coordinates in the graphs coordinate system. Occasionally, though, the user will click right as the graph is updating, and then codeevent.xdatacode and code.ydatacode are codeNonecode. Right now Im just discarding those clicks, but obviously its pretty frustrating for the user when the application just ignores their clicks.p  pIve attached a full sample program so that you can see how Im replacing the current graph with the new one. If you run it and click on the graph repeatedly youll see that the reported emxem coordinate is sometimes codeNonecode. Can I replace the figures data in a way that never gives codeNonecode for the coordinates I only want one set of data to be shown at a time.p  h2Example programh2  precodefrom future import printfunction from math import exp from matplotlib.backends.backendwxagg import FigureCanvasWxAgg      as FigureCanvas from matplotlib.figure import Figure from random import normalvariate from threading import Timer from time import sleep import wx  class GraphViewwx.Panel     def initself, parent         wx.Panel.initself, parent          self.figure  Figure         canvas  FigureCanvasself, 1, self.figure         canvas.mplconnectbuttonreleaseevent, self.mouseuphandler          self.axes  None          sizer  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL         sizer.Addcanvas, 1, wx.GROW         self.SetSizersizer          self.generatenewdata      def generatenewdataself         xvalues  range16384         yvalues  [expnormalvariate0, 10 for  in range16384]          if self.axes is not None             self.figure.delaxesself.axes          sleep0.4   simulate some additional work being done with the data          self.axes  self.figure.addsubplot1, 1, 1         self.axes.setyscalelog         self.axes.autoscaleenableTrue         self.axes.setxlimxvalues[0], xvalues[1]         self.axes.plotxvalues, yvalues, antialiasedFalse          self.figure.canvas.draw          Timer1.0, self.generatenewdata.start      def mouseuphandlerself, event         printClick at x  .formatevent.xdata   class GraphWindowwx.Frame     def initself, parent         wx.Frame.initself, parent         graphview  GraphViewself   if name  main     app  wx.AppFalse     GraphWindowNone.Show     app.MainLoop codepre

Negative 4190 pI have an EC2based REST web service which is connected to a set of worker instances via SQS. I am hoping to replace this current setup with a hrefhttpwww.celeryproject.org relnofollowCelerya, retaining for the moment SQS as the broker. p  pI am not sure my mental picture of how Celery operates is quite accurate, however. Following the pattern that seems to be implied in a hrefhttpblog.4psa.comoffloadingtoworkersahandsonexample relnofollowthisa article, my understanding was that I could enqueue messages to SQS from my API, and these would then be processed by the Celery workers in a timely fashion. The examples I have found, however almost none of which involve using SQS as a broker, seem to indicate that Celery emitselfem does the enqueuing. So Celery acts like a wrapper for the queue, submitting and processing tasks. Its acting as both producer emandem consumer  is that right If so that seems like a big problem for me, since I dont use Python. The workers themselves would use execl to run the actual tasks, but how would I handle the initial submission of the message into the queue, from the API server Is this something that Celery even allowsp  pAm I right about this, or was my original understanding accurate Or are they equally legitimate ways in which Celery can be utilizedp

Negative 4190 pFirst off, Im very new to Snap and Heist p  pIn all templating engines that I have used, there is always a way to pass a variable from the render function to the template. The template can then display the variable in its place. Now, I do understand that Heist is particularly strict, but Im not even trying to do a loop or an ifelse here, just display a random number. I imagine this is a pretty basic thing, but I havent found anything in the docs that shows how this can be done without using splices.p  pSo in short, is it possible to have a Snap handler that generates a number, then passes it to a Heist template to render, without using splices If yes, please give me some example code, if no, please show me the simplest way it can be done.p

Negative 4190 pI am writing a program in Java and I want it to accept two different methods of input. One would be piping a file into into the program like this codejava program lt inputFile.txtcode Another way I want the input is for the program to wait in the middle of execution for the command line input by the user before continuing. Also, I want to process the input differently depending on which method was used.p  pIve checked myself and both types of input come from System.in. Is there any value in System.in that would depend on the method of input used If not from System.in, is there any other way to derive a value thats inputmethod dependent p

Negative 4190 pI have a producerconsumer situation, where I want to decide between two mechanisms to implement it. It is an audiorecordingencoding case The producer polls device microphone ,continuously, for the recorded audio, and when an audio sample is available, passes that sample to the Consumer, which is an encoder, to do the encoding and saving.p  pThe two available mechanisms arep  ol liTwo threads with a queue to pass messages from Producer to Consumer. li liOr, a Handler as the consumer, where messages are posted by the producer, when it is available. li ol  pBut, I am not sure which one is more efficientp  pIf two threads are used with a queue, then the consumer stronghas tostrong run in a while loop. For example, if the task continues for 5 minutes, this loop has to run for 5 minutes. While, if Handler is used, my understanding is, that the handler consumer only runs when there is a message, when its handleMessage method is invoked. Is this assumption about how handler works true, That it does not run in continues loop. Therefore, I conclude that in this respect, handler is more efficient.p  pBut, on the other hand, a queue seems to be simpler mechanism, probably requiring less work, compared to Handlers message passing mechanism, which is repeated on every message Again, is this assumption truep  pNow, based on the above two assumptions, which to me seem conflicting, I am not sure which of the two mechanism is more efficient. p  pstrongNotestrong I did not post any code, because, I think this a generic situation.p  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIn terms of implementations, both mechanisms are relatively simple to implement. My question was rather about the runtime behavior of two mechanisms. As, I have at least 5 thread where  it is critical for each of them to run continuously. Now, my question was, in such a case, which of the two options are better Specifically for an Android application, considering how Handlers and Loopers and HandlerThread work p  ol liImplement N thread, each running in a while loop. Communication mechanism is simpler, a queue. But N concurrent loops.li liImplement producers as running in a loop, but consumers as Handlers. Not N concurrent loops at least on the surface, behind the seen it might actually be the case, but a more involved communication invoves thread message queue, Looper mechanisms, special message passing, etc.li ol

Negative 4190 pSimple question, in a console application, how can we make a codeSystem.Timers.Timercode Elapsed event be called in the main threadp  pIve read something about the codeSyncronizingObjectcode property but, currently I had no sucess in trying to implement a class which implements codeISyncronizeInvokecode interface.p  pstrongEDITstrong for clarificationp  pIm trying to simulate a classic event model. I have some code which watches for the state of some devices using an event based approach. The problem is that some of the devices dont send their statuses using events and require the application to poll for the data. p  pThe solution found was to use a timer and poll the devices. If any change was detected, then we would raise a similar event of the existing ones.p  pThe problem is that the legacy code is far from thread safe and adapting it would be quite a quest.p  pMaybe theres a better approach.p

Negative 4190 pI am asking  a very basic question but I am feeling a great problem while managing sessions. Actually I have an requirement to show pop up,5 minutes before session expires that Your session is going to expire in next 5 minutes Press yes to continue and no to not.p  pYes, Session time was 15 minutes earlier when everything was working fine. I have then changed the session timeout to 30 as per new requirementsp  plike   p  precode ltsessionState timeout30gt     ltsessionStategt codepre  pAfter 25 minutes, I show pop up to alert client that in next 5 minutes your session will be expired. So, following that pop up opens and alerts the client but what happens is session expired at 27th minute. I calculate it with time. I set the session  variable when login is successful then  It comes to the home page . The home page layout calculates the  25 minutes and then show pop up client side. Even if one thinks that it takes overhead after setting session and coming to home page and loading of script where I have defined function for pop up then also It should be the overhead of  20 seconds only as it comfortabley loads in 10 seconds. So, my problem is session expires before the set session time. That is session expired after 26 minutes and at start of 27th minute.p  pWhy I am facing this issue is undetectable by me.If I have induced wrong logic , its okay that should be a functionality default but session is not controlled by me. I set time out to 30 minutes, but it overs before this time. after exactly 26 minutes. p  pThis is how I am measuring Time  myTimer calls after 25 minutes and after 25 minutes this function shows pop upp  pmyVar  setIntervalfunction   myTimer , 1500000p

Negative 4190 pI need some help checking out a java project from a SVN repository. In order to validate my work, I created a test java project in my local workspace, and am able to create a jar file of it. But I can not do that with the project that I check out from SVN. This is a project, which others have successfully checked out. Before I started I knew very little about SVN, so I read this url a hrefhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkslibraryoseclsubversion relnofollowHow to use Subversion with Eclipsea I am using subclipse v 1.6.18 I choose checkout after rightclicking the repository from repository perspective. The developer of the code told me to use revision 10. So I click the selection button, and from the list of revisions I double click revision 10. and click on Finish. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comg7B1Q.png altpic1  I also choose the check out as a project in the workspace and call the project javacardreader. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRPfjl.png altpic2 Unlike the tutorial I saw on youtube about SVN. I do not see any option to synchronize with the repository in the java perspective. I do see the javacardreader project in my java perspective. But when I try to create a jar file from it, the folder does not show up as an option like my other test project. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh4jDX.png altpic3 I also do not see an option for adding the binaries to SVN ignor in my list. My question is what am I doing wrong My understanding is that revisions are changes  improvements that developers make to the code. One question that came up in my discussion with the developer was if I am pulling the committed code. How can I make sure I am doing that Where should I look Am I missing something about how SVN works p

Negative 4190 pIm having the following problem Id like to build a script which should work strongin every directory, regardless wheter rootdirectory or subdirectorystrong. So the most important thing is, that I have a .htaccessfile which will strongredirect all requests to the index.phpstrong in the directory where the script was installed. The redirect is simple, there are plenty of tutorials. But the problem is that I dont know the path in which the script was installed. I dont know if its a subdirectory or rootdirectory. The only solution I see is to make a install.php which will modify the htaccess with the correct paths. But are there better solutionsp  pstrongThank youstrongp  pUpdate Since there is apparently misunderstandings with my question, I will give you an example. Lets say my project contains only one index.php and a .htaccessfile. The .htaccessfile should redirect all requests to the index.php. That is very simple, strongBUTstrong the .htaccessfile does not know in which directory it will be called, so it could be the user installed the project in xyz but also in the root directory . If I request xyzabc123echoworld the .htaccessfile does not know in which of this directories the index.php is for the redirect, it only knows that it should redirect to the index.php of the root of the script. So my solution would be to make a install.php and change the .htaccessfile with the correct paths, but arent there better solutionsp

The synchronisation issue comes from the fact that javascript is not good at synchronising calls.p  pThe process is done as followp  p1 A user records himselfp  precode[User 1] gt Records on his browser an audio file         Saves raw audio file call it audio1.ogg     [Server] codepre  p2 Another user wants to join user1s projectp  precode[User 2]  lt Fetch audio1.ogg in an audio html tag  [Server]         Press record     [Webapp] gt Plays audio1.ogg and starts recording audio2.ogg         Saves audio2.ogg when record is over     [Server] codepre  pThe synchronisation issue comes from the fact that there are no way in strongJavascriptstrong to ensure that both the functions handling that starts emrecordem and the one responsible for beginning playing the existing audio file happen on the same time.p  pI end up with 50100 ms of gap depending on how many audio files are already on the project since its not limited to two. p

Negative 4190 pI recently added some non unique indexes to two tables. Theses tables have number of rows in the millions, and 100mbs in size including the size of indexes. After adding the new INDEX type index none unique one of the index had a cardinality comparable to that of the primary key, the other column was a rather low cardinality. Correct me if Im wrong but my understanding is that the higher the cardinality of an index the more useful it will be in speeding where clause queries. So since one had a high cardinality I though this should have a noticeable effect on queries. p  pAnyway after adding the indexes, I was not sure if I saw a difference or not in the speed of the where queries using those columns. Then I somewhat recall that in the past when I added indexes it took some time before it effected queries like a day or two. Maybe it was just my imagination. Will the newly added indexes have immediate effect in this case In any casep  pThank you for your time.p

On the fields Lookup tab, the Column Widths property isp  p01.2605p  pSo I guess SignerID is there in the Access query result but with a column width of 0.p  pUnfortunately that doesnt help me on the ADO side. Any suggestions on getting SignerName instead of SignerID in the ADO query resultp  pUpdate2p  pHeres a sample SQL statement that returns different fields depending on either its in Access or in ADOp  precodeSELECT MasterAccount.[SignerKey1]  FROM MasterAccount  codepre  pPer Preets request, heres the ADO code in Excel VBAp  precodestrDatabasePath  rgDatabasePathCell.Value rgDatabasePathCell is a worksheet cell object. strPWD  DATABASEPASSWORD  Set cnn  New ADODB.Connection cnn.Provider  Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 cnn.ConnectionString  Data Source amp strDatabasePath amp Jet OLEDBDatabase Password amp strPWD amp  cnn.Open  Set cmd  New ADODB.Command cmd.ActiveConnection  cnn cmd.CommandType  adCmdText cmd.CommandText  strSQL Set rst  New ADODB.Recordset  rst.Open cmd.Execute  shMA.Cells2, 1.CopyFromRecordset rst shMA is a worksheet object. codepre  pUpdate 3p  pIt occurred to me that from what Ive said so far, it might seem like I could just change thisp  precodeSELECT MasterAccount.[SignerKey1]  FROM MasterAccount  codepre  pto thisp  precodeSELECT [Signers].[SignerName]  FROM MasterAccount  codepre  pBut there are 13 affected lookup fields, all with exactly the same Row Source property text as shown above, and all return different SignerName items for each row. I dont know why they are all returning different items per row I have not been able to find any difference in the way they are defined. Ive been tasked with getting the same result in Excel as that Access query gets.p  pUpdate 4p  pVBlades  Thanks, I found the form that has a tab with dropdowns for each of the 13 SignerKeyn fields. If I rightclick that form and choose Form Properties, the RecordSource property isp  precodeSELECT MasterAccount., Bank.BankRating FROM Bank INNER JOIN MasterAccount ON Bank.BankID  MasterAccount.Bank codepre  pHowever I dont understand how that would be selecting a different SignerName item for each of the 13 SignerKeyn fields, or what to do with this information to get the same results in ADO as in the Access query. Any suggestionsp  pUpdate 5p  pI may be close to a workaround. If I do this, I get the SignerName field for SignerKey1p  precodeSELECT Signers.SignerName FROM Signers RIGHT JOIN MasterAccount ON Signers.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey1.Value codepre  pAnd if I do this, I get different SignerName items for each field on each rowp  precodeSELECT Signers.SignerName, Signers1.SignerName, Signers2.SignerName FROM Signers AS Signers2 INNER JOIN Signers AS Signers1 INNER JOIN Signers RIGHT JOIN MasterAccount ON Signers.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey1.Value ON Signers1.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey2.Value ON Signers2.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey3 codepre  pThat works both in an Access query and in ADO. Next step, Ill try to add these joins to the main SQL statement.p  pUpdate 6p  pWell, when I try to add even one of those 13 joins to the main SQL statement, it works fine in an Access query, but in ADO I get the errorp  pRow handles must all be released before new ones can be obtained.p  pSo Im stuck. Any suggestionsp  pIve raised the issue with the database owner, but they dont know why the affected fields Row Source property includes SignerID, so Im not sure if thats going to help.p

Negative 4190 pedit I am aware this question appears to be a duplicate of previous questions, but i have tried all the answers to the older questions I found and none of them worked in my case.p  pI have a widget that displays a list of links with an image next to each link. The image is dynamically generated based on the class of the link, so every image is different, and as such has a different height. The structure is such that I have an outer div called wrapper, and inside each wrapper is a div with the image and a div with the link, floated left so that the link appears next to the image.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comTbLcDPm.png altdiv alignmentp  pIve added a colored border to each div so that you can see them easily. p  pI need the link div the one with the blue border to be vertically centered, so that its centered relative to the image rather than aligned with the top. Here is my codep  precodeltli classitem.Categorygtltdiv classwrappergtltdiv classimgBoxgtltimg srcimgSrcgtltdivgtltdiv classlinkBoxgtlta hrefitem.Link.NavigateUrlgt item.Link.Textltagt ltdivgtltdivgtltligt codepre  pand the cssp  precode .wrapper      width 100     display inlineblock     border 1px solid green  .imgBox      width 55px     float left     border 1px solid red  .imgBox gt img      display block     margin 0 auto  .linkBox      float left     border 1px solid blue     display block     marginbottom auto  codepre  pI have tried numerous methods to get linkBox vertically centered, but I cant get anything to work. Because wrapper does not have a set height, setting the height of linkBox to 100 doesnt work.

Negative 4190 pI am trying to create an application for learning purposes going along with an Async in C book. However I am having trouble implementing the ideas in the form of which i want. Please let me know if this is doable or not.p  pBasically, I have a console application with 3 classes. The user inputs some data on the console and then I have a class which executes a SQL commandquery and creates a datatable. However the queries actually take quite a bit of time depending on the time of day so this is what I Want I want to run the classfunction which executes my sql query, executes some code right below it in the main program, and then wait for the sql querydata table to finish. After this I then do an export to excel. A portion of the code is below, but what I am having trouble with is the syntax for the async command. I tried making a task which indicates the calling of the sql query function but i get a compiler error saying it cannot convert the type into a task. Is there a way to do this by assigning my createReport function as a task and then awaiting for it to complete later on p  precode if Regex.IsMatchNumber,d ampamp Number.Length lt 3                 reportCreate.createReportdetailLength,detailDate,detailNumber       This was my original syntax but I want to make this asynchronous or in     a separate thread so I can continue working below.       do some comparing work here while the sql querydatatable is running.      Wait for the datatable thread to finish and then continue with the code      below. Is there a way to do this using task and await                 codepre

Negative 4190 pI made a software to process images. It tries to find patterns in images and, in case it finds a pattern that its looking for, it writes the image name, pattern type and coordinates in a text file.p  pAs you probably know, image processing takes a long time. So I decided to use multithreading to increase the performance.p  precodebool Multithread  CheckMultithread UpdateParameters  if Multithread      Parallel.For0, FileNames.Length ,i gt SolveFileNames[i]  else       foreach string s in FileNames                Solves        codepre  pThis is the first time I try to use multithreading in C. But I there are no multithread related mistakes here, since the processing does not interfere with the processing of another image.p  pThe problem is if the Multithreading is ON, I get a OutOfMemoryException when I reach the 200th or so image... Obviously this kind of parallelism where practically the whole code runs in different threads consume N times more memory with N  the number of threads being run... p  pI revised every class I created, and only one uses unmanaged code QuickBitmap.cs, a wrapper for the Bitmap class, using lockbits and unlockbits to improve the performance. But I have implemented IDisposable interface in that class, so... I dont know why this is happening.p  pEach thread need  400 mb of ram to run. strongWhen the OutOfMemoryException is thrown, the program is using around 1300 mb of ram. Even tho I have over 9 GBs of free memorystrongp  pTo deal with this exception I add the following code, right in the begging of Solvep  precode        if GC.GetTotalMemoryfalse gt 100010001000                      lock Manager.dasLock                              Manager.sw.Start                 GC.Collect                 Manager.sw.Stop                       codepre  pProcessedCount is a strongstatic intstrong incremented inside a lock statement.p  pAfter adding that piece of code the program can process all images 2000 without throwing any exceptions. I also never uses more than 1.5 GB of ram.p  pBut since everyone is FLAMING me for DARING to call the almighty GC... strongWhat can I do to prevent thisstrongp  pI can post more detailed code, if you guys want.p  pPs in the last lines of Solve I call Dispose of each object with unmanaged resources, and set all my vars to null.p  pPps yes, this is a 32 bit software, but the limit should be 4 GBs instead of 1.5, rightp  pEdit3 change the GC.Collect calling code. Just so I can have an idea of how much time I spend collecting. For every minute processing, Im spending 0.4s collecting.p

Negative 4190 pA a hrefhttpssyncevolution.org relnofollowSyncEvolutiona user has reported problems with mirroring a local calendar in Google Calendar when refreshing Google Calendar via CalDAV  DELETE all events and recreate with PUT, some PUT commands fail with 404 Not Found.p  pIt looks like this happens for VEVENTs which have an ORGANIZER i.e., meetings. It works for simpler VEVENTs that have no ORGANIZER. Example of the failure below.p  pI believe this is a known limitation of Google CalDAV.

Negative 4190 pI am working on a strange bug in our implementation of ArcGIS maps.

Negative 4190 pWe use SQL server for our applications session state. Since the SQL server is a single point of failure, when it has problems it can affect all our customers. To mitigate this issue, we plan to create a SQL 2012 High availability instance and move .Net session management to its own servers. The SQL 2012 High availability instance can fail over automatically or manually when there are problems with a node. We are planning to use viprion to shard session state data across these lightweight AspState instances. Instead of using viprion to shard .Net session data at the webserver level, is there an alternate application level sharding approach that we can consider This should be a common enough problem for high traffic ASP.Net sites that use .Net session management. p

Negative 4190 pAm using picketlink for an application and I would greatly appreciate if any one could help me out. p  pThe application has many Groups Admin, Customer Service etc and each group can have many Roles like Create a new User, Create a new employee, Launch a payroll process etcp  pA user can be assigned to one or more groups, and a group to one or more roles. Normally I thought that a user assigned to a group will inherit all the roles of the group. If I use BasicModel.hasRole for a user assigned to a group, it returns true for all roles assigned to that group, which is as expected. However when using RolesAllowed annotation on my rest end points, it will always return access denied exception for the same user. If there any workaround anyone can suggest I want RolesAllowed to allow users within a group having the allowed roles to pass through.p  pOr is there any other annotation I can usep

Negative 4190 pI am desperate for some assistance with this and would be extremely grateful for some help.p  pMy project team currently use TFS 2012 as our VCS and TeamCity as our Continuous Integration Server. p  pIn TFS, we have multiple Build Definitions set up for each project and this collection include some bespokecustomised build definitions. Each build definition is driven by a unique build process template. Consequently, within each project, we have two or more customised build process templates, along with the outofthebox templates which include the Default and Lab templates. p  pWe use TeamCity as our Continuous Integration system and this connects to TFS as our version control system.p  pWithin TeamCity, I have set up a Build Configuration and Build Step which has MSBuild as the Runner type. What I am desperate now to pass to MSBuild is the name of a specific Build Definition from the collection detailed above. This build defintion will be driven by one of my customised build process templates.......not the Default, Lab or any other proecess template.p  pIn short, what Im keen to achieve is the ability to set a Build Definition name as an MSBuild property. It doesnt necessarily have to be from within a TeamCity context. If anyone can advise how to even achieve this from the command line, that would be perfect for now.p  pAny ideas pleasep  pThank you.p
Negative 4190 pI have a Laravel PHP application that allows the user to select a category from a drop down box and after the user makes their selection, the application then retrieves the results via a strongForm Submissionstrong by matching on the selected category.

Negative 4190 pHi I am learning Josh Smiths Wpf app and trying to understand the MVVM pattern.  You can download the app from a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comKRHxo.png relnofollowhereap  pMy question is very simple, the app has Menu Items defined on the MainView which are bound to the MainWindow view model.  I need to click the menu options to trigger a check box in the CustomerViewModel.  So far this is what I have done, I wired the menuitem click command to a method in the MainWindowViewModel, this method then raises an event Called OptionsMenuItemClicked. I then implemented a listener on the CustomerViewModel, this listener would call a method which should do my logic for doing check on the check box.  The event is raised but the method is not firing.  Can anyone please help.

Negative 4190 pI am using SQL statements embedded in two PHP files to produce a database that appears in HTML as well as in phpMyAdmin. I have created a table like with the following commandp  precodesql  CREATE TABLE WeatherCenter OutgoingLongwaveRadiation VARCHAR30 codepre  pIn the second PHP file, I havep  precodesql  ALTER TABLE WeatherCenter             ADD COLUMN                  Barometric Pressure SMALLINT NOT NULL,                 CloudType VARCHAR70 NOT NULL,                 WhenLikelyToRain VARCHAR30 NOT NULL codepre  pWhen I execute the files, I keep getting Undefined column Barometric Pressure does not exist in filed list. I realized that this is because somewhere else in my PHP file I listed the variable as BarometricPressure and not Barometric Pressure ie. one has a gap, and the other doesnt. When I corrected the mistake in the ALTER TABLE by deleting the gap, the same error message STILL appeared in the phpMyAdmin database. It seems to me that changing the name of the field in the PHP file does NOT change it in the phpMyAdmin database. As a result, no data is being transmitted to the database. Could someone tell me if I changed the syntax of the above top  precode sql  ALTER TABLE WeatherCenter  ADD COLUMN Barometric Pressure SMALLINT NOT NULL AFTER OutgoingLongwaveRaadiation,  ADD COLUMN CloudType VARCHAR70 NOT NULL AFTER BarometricPressure,  ADD COLUMN WhenLikelyToRain VARCHAR30 NOT NULL AFTER CloudType  codepre  pwill the problem go away I mean, do you HAVE to use an ADD COLUMN before EACH field name, and do you HAVE to specify the AFTER previous field name Do you have to take these additional measures to ensure that any mistake in the field name that appears in the phpMyAdmin can be erased by rewriting your code in the PHP file Could someone simply tell me what the correct syntax is please, because there appears to be inconsistencies. Some of the ALTER TABLE statements do not have opening and close brackets and no backticks, but other ALTER TABLE statements make it clear that you must have opening and closing brackets and backticks such that the last few characters in the ALTER TABLE statement MUST be p  pI am throughly confused.p

Negative 4190 pIve been working on a django app recently and it is finally ready to get deployed to a qa and production environment. Everything worked perfectly locally, but since adding the complexity of the real world deployment Ive had a few issues.p  pFirst my tech stack is a bit complicated. For deployments I am using aws for everything with my site deployed on multiple ec2s backed by a load balancer. The load balancer is secured with ssl, but the connections to the load balancer are forwarded to the ec2s over standard http on port 80. After hitting an ec2 on port 80 they are forwarded to a docker container on port 8000 if you are unfamiliar with docker just consider it to be a standard vm. Inside the container nginx listens on port 8000, it handles a redirection for the static files in django and for web requests it forwards the request to django running on 127.0.0.18001. Django is being hosted by uwsgi listening on port 8001.p  precodeserver      listen   8000     servername localhost      location static          alias homelibrarydeploythelibrarystatic           location           proxysetheader XForwardedHost host443         proxypass http127.0.0.18001       codepre  pI use XForwarded host because I was having issues with redirects from google oauth and redirects to prompt the user to login making the browser request the url 127.0.0.18001 which will obviously not work. Within my settings.py file I also included p  precodeUSEXFORWARDEDHOST  True codepre  pto force django to use the correct host for redirects.p  pRight now general browsing of the site works perfectly, static files load, redirects work and the site is secured with ssl. The problem however is that CSRF verification fails.p  pOn a form submission I get the following error p  pReferer checking failed  a hrefhttpsqaloadbalancer.comprojectsnew relnofollowhttpsqaloadbalancer.comprojectsnewa does not match a hrefhttpsqaloadbalancer.com443 relnofollowhttpsqaloadbalancer.com443a.p  pIm really not sure what to do about this, its really through stackoverflow questions that I got everything working so far.p

Negative 4190 pIm interested in scraping a lot of different websites as quickly as possible. The URLs could have any number of issues for web scraping e.g., they may refer to files instead of sites, or they may not point to anything real at all. The issue I havent been able to resolve is what to do when BeautifulSoup hangs, or fails for some reason and doesnt exit. There needs to be a way to stop the html parsing if it cant seem to do it after X seconds. This seems to be remarkably nontrivial, but it seems Im not the only one, with this website seeming to provide the most relevant information a hrefhttpeli.thegreenplace.net20110822hownottosetatimeoutonacomputationinpython relnofollowhttpeli.thegreenplace.net20110822hownottosetatimeoutonacomputationinpythonap  pSo, given that its quite hard to kill a hanging process such as BeautifulSouptext after a certain time has expired, what should I do p
Negative 4190 pI am using pdfkit to dynamically generate PDF documents within a nodewebkit application. The PDFs contain peoples comments coming from a remote source via an HTTP request.p  pIt works really well, however now I spotted that when a comment is in Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, etc. it doesnt render correctly, and I have no means of knowing what language the comments will be coming inin fact I am gathering them from around the world.p  pI understood that I need to use the right font that should have proper characters included, as explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17206442howtonodejspdfkitoutputjapaneseorchineseherea. I spotted this google noto open font which has it all, but the problem is that there is no single TTF file with all languages, and there cant be as font files are limited to 65K glyphs. p  pI am trying to find a solution that lets render text in almost any language within a PDF using pdfkit, without having to write a sophisticated language recognition tool, which I feel would be an overkill. p  pAny thoughts and suggestions will be much appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Use a hrefhttpsgithub.comdevongovettfontmanager relnofollowfontmanagera by the author of pdfkit to substitute the font. Also you may want to try phantomJSI havent done that though. See detailed response by levi in the comments if you have the same problem. Hope it helps.p

Negative 4190 pIm trying to tell my jboss to write an access log with all information I need and use a daily log rotation. So far this is not an issue. The ultimate goal is to send all access log entries to an elk stack using logstash forwarder. Also not that big a deal. The problem Im having now is to define the access logs names. p  pJBoss offers log rotation out of the box but adds a timestamp to each logfile so todays file also has a timestamp suffix.p  pWhat I want to achive is the same behavior as tomcat or as jbosses server.log. Meaning todays file should just be named access.log and only have a suffix appended when todays file becomes yesterdays file and hence is rotated into inactve state.p  pmy jboss config looks like thisp  precodeltsubsystem xmlnsurnjbossdomainlogging1.3gt     ltperiodicrotatingfilehandler nameFILE autoflushtruegt         ltformattergt             ltpatternformatter patterndHHmmss,SSS 5p [c] t sEngt         ltformattergt         ltfile relativetojboss.server.log.dir pathserver.loggt         ltsuffix value.yyyyMMddgt         ltappend valuetruegt     ltperiodicrotatingfilehandlergt     ltperiodicrotatingfilehandler nameACCESS autoflushtruegt         ltformattergt             ltpatternformatter patterndHHmmss,SSS 5p [c] t sEngt         ltformattergt         ltfile relativetojboss.server.log.dir pathaccess.loggt         ltsuffix value.yyyyMMddgt         ltappend valuetruegt     ltperiodicrotatingfilehandlergt     ltlogger categorycom.arjunagt         ltlevel nameWARNgt     ltloggergt     ltlogger categoryorg.apache.tomcat.util.modelergt         ltlevel nameWARNgt     ltloggergt     ltlogger categoryorg.jboss.as.configgt         ltlevel nameDEBUGgt     ltloggergt     ltlogger categorysun.rmigt         ltlevel nameWARNgt     ltloggergt     ltlogger categoryjacorbgt         ltlevel nameWARNgt     ltloggergt     ltlogger categoryjacorb.configgt         ltlevel nameERRORgt     ltloggergt     ltrootloggergt         ltlevel nameINFOgt         lthandlersgt             lthandler nameFILEgt             lthandler nameACCESSgt         lthandlersgt     ltrootloggergt ltsubsystemgt codepre  pAnd here is my accesslog config with log rotation enabled has above mentioned timestamp behavior.

First is writing into an access.log with no timestamp and add timestamp on rotation so the logstash forwarder can always read access.log. Second is set up the forwarders config to always check the newest access.log file. This way the timestamped filename wouldnt be an issue. But I dont know if thats possible.p  pId be grateful for any advice. Thanks and regards. Sebastianp

Based on the user type, I want to redirect them to both myaccount but show different templates.p  pHere is my codep  precodedef userloginrequest contextdict   if request.method POST     username  request.POST[username]     password  request.POST[password]      user authenticateusernameusername, passwordpassword      teacher flow     if user.teacher         if user.isactive             loginrequest, user             template  teacheraccount.html             contextdict[teacher]  user             return renderrequest, template, contextdict         else             return HttpResponseYour account is disabled     client flow     elif user.client         if user.isactive             loginrequest, user             template  clientaccount.html             contextdict[client]  user             return renderrequest, template, contextdict         else             return HttpResponseYour account is disabled      else         print Invalid login details 0, 1.formatusername, password         return HttpResponseInvalid login details supplied GET Request else     return renderrequest, login.html,  codepre  pIt actually works sort of, the redirect doesnt, but the login does if it is a teacher. Ive tried debugging and if the user is a client, for some reason the flow doesnt drop into the else if but just errors out. In the debugger I can see that the client object exists, but I am getting the error RelatedObjectDoesNotExist  User has no teacher. What am I doing wrongp  pDjango 1.7, Python 2.7p

Negative 4190 pIn Java, a set only checks for equality of an object with objects already in the set only at insertion time.  That means that if after an object is already present in the set, it becomes equal to another object in the set, the set will keep both equal objects without complaining.p  pEDIT For example, consider a simple object, and assume that hashCode and equals are defined following best practicesp  precodeclass Foo      int foo      Fooint a foo  a       equals and hashcode based on foo   Foo foo1  new Foo1 Foo foo2  new Foo2 SetltFoogt set  new HashSetltFoogt set.addfoo1 set.addfoo2 Here the set has two unequal elements. foo2.foo  1 At this point, foo2 is equal to foo1, but is still in the set  together with foo1. codepre  pHow could a set class could be designed for mutable objects The behavior I would expected would be the following If at any time one of the objects in the set becomes equal to another object in the set, that object is deleted from the set by the set. Is there one already Is there a programming language that would make this easier to accomplishp

Negative 4190 pI will start by apologizing I highly doubt I will have any of the correct terminology, unfortenately after a few hours of raw testing and mashing my head against the wall I can figure this out.p  pI working with an engine the orients its models using a bottom aligned system. Meaning that the z axis in a z up system, is z  radius  origin, or if the model is sitting at 0,0,0 all the tris would be in positivez space.p  pI am integrating bullet which is a center aligned system, meaning that the objects origin is in the center of the mass in this case a simple aabb cube.p  pI have the problem that the yaw pitch roll and origin i pass into the renderer is offset by radius in the z direction. Now the biggest issue comes when the pitch or roll becomes something other than 0. Because bullets center aligned system, rotates around the pitch and roll around the center and the render rotates around the bottom. So there is a clear difference in where the model and the bounding box are lining up.p  pSo is there an algorithm to convert from these two forms of orientationp
Negative 4190 pIm working on an HTML view for iAd Producer. Im trying to add a list of sentences which have alternative words students can choose and to save those values to localStorage as they change and repopulate the selects with those values when the page is revisited.p  pIm adapting some code I wrote which works fine to save multiple input boxes on a page. But I have strange behaviour when trying to use it with multiple selects. Basically, no matter which order the answers are completed in, only the last chosen value is being stored.

Negative 4190 pIn the last few months Ive worked on a number of projects where Ive used the codeglmnetcode package to fit elastic net models. Its great, but the interface is rather barebones compared to most R modelling functions. In particular, rather than specifying a formula and data frame, you have to give a response vector and predictor matrix. You also lose out on many qualityoflife things that the regular interface provides, eg sensible  treatment of factors, missing values, putting variables into the correct order, etc.p  pSo Ive generally ended up writing my own code to recreate the formuladata frame interface. Due to client confidentiality issues, Ive also ended up leaving this code behind and having to write it again for the next project. I figured I might as well bite the bullet and create an actual package to do this.

Negative 4190 pIm writing a job in go that goes through some MySQL tables, selects some of the rows based on some critera, extracts email addresses from them and sends an email to each. p  pThe filtering process looks at a table lets call it codestoragecode which is pretty big 6gb dumped and looks like thisp  precodeColumns id      varchar64 PK path    varchar64 PK game    varchar64 guid    varchar64 value   varchar512 timestamp   timestamp codepre  pThere are two indices codeid, pathcode the PK as seen above and codeguidcode. p  pThe job first retrieves a long list of guids from one table, then batches them and performs consecutive queries like this on the codestoragecode tablep  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT guid, timestamp FROM storage  WHERE game  somegame  AND path  path AND value  value AND timestamp gt 20150422 000000.0 AND timestamp lt 20150429T1453070200  AND guid IN  ...  codepre  pWhere the codeINcode clause contains a list of guids. p  pI need to retrieve timestamps to be able to filter further.p  pstrongWhen running against my local MySQLstrong, everything works as expected, the query takes about 180ms with batches of 1000 guids.p  pstrongWhen running against the same DB on Amazon RDSstrong, the queries begin quick, but after some point, they suddenly start taking around 30 seconds, and continue to do so until the job ends. p  pI have tried many many things to fix this, but cant figure out the reason. Some notesp  ul liThe job uses only one codesql.DBcode object. Also, I prepare the above statement once and reuse it quite heavily. li liAt first, I thought it was because the RDS DB was running MySQL 5.5, and I was running 5.6. I made a replica of the RDS DB, upgraded to 5.6, ran the job again. The problem happened again.li liThe volume of data in the two databases is the same I dumped the production database and imported it into my local database and ran the job. Same behaviour it still ran quickly locally.li liThe AWS monitoring of the RDS nodes doesnt show any significant spikes. The CPU usage jumps from 1 to up to 10, and the job seems to open just a few connections 4.li liI had a colleague run the job on their PC, pointing to emmyem MySQL DB, just to make sure the great performance didnt stem from the fact that the connection was local. It ran just as quickly as on my PC admittedly, over LAN.li liI ran the job against RDS emboth from my local PCem and from eman Amazon EC2 nodeem, which is considerably closer to RDS. From EC2, it performed better, but the problem still appeared. li liThe job is very concurrent, each step has input and output channels with buffer sizes of 1000, and the work is performed by goroutines. Between the steps, I have other goroutines that batch the output of the previous goroutine. li liThe slowdown is sudden, one query takes milliseconds, and the next one takes tens of seconds. li ul  pI havent the faintest idea why this happens. Any suggestions would be appreciated. p

I can send the variable fine with ajax to the php file and return with the success property of the same ajax function.

Negative 4190 pIve got a WPF datagrid that has a dependency property. Im using MVVM and the WPF datagrid is bound to an observable collection. The grid holds the results of a search. When the search button is clicked, I retrieve data from the database, populate the observable collection which then populates the grid. All good On the last line of the search button click method, I update the dependency property to true, which triggers the dependency property to fire. The code in the dependency property class will format the datagrid things like setting borders on certain cells and also ensuring that repeating data is shown only once.p  pMy problem started when one of the business requirements was to be able to sort by clicking the column headers. Using the default sorting of the wpf datagrid causes the grid to lose the formatting, so I created my own sorting handler and at the end of it I set e.handled  true to disable default sorting by the wpf datagrid control. Still all goodp  pThe problem appears now. If I do a fresh search by clicking the search button, the results in the grid are displayed but are not getting formatted Ive put a breakpoint on the dependency code and found that the breakpoint doesnt get hit in this instance.p  pSo my question is... does the code in the sorting which Ive included below somehow break the binding of the dependency property with the datagrid Id like to draw your attention to the code where Im clearing the collection and repopulating it again. Should I perhaps be implementing the sorting differently that might not give rise to this behaviour p  pCode in my sorting handler.p  precodevoid fgSortingobject sender, DataGridSortingEventArgs e          System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid dg  sender as System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid         if dg  null              return                  DataGridMergeCellBehavior.SetIsMergeddg, false          ObservableCollectionltAssetPPM2GridEntitygt source  dg.ItemsSource as ObservableCollectionltAssetPPM2GridEntitygt          ListltAssetPPM2GridEntitygt myList  source.OrderByx gt x.Property.ToList         source.Clear         foreach var item in myList              source.Additem           This property below is the dependency property which formats the grid.

Negative 4190 pI am currently working on a project in which I need to implement a Kalman filter for data fusion in Simulink. As this system is nonlinear, I have thought about implementing an extended Kalman filter. However, as a matter of safety, I need to be able to shut down a defective sensor, and thus not take into account the erroneous values he may deliver.p  pThe sequential Kalman filter would be a nice solution, as taking out a measure simply means to ignore the corresponding iteration. Now, the only implementations of the sequential Kalman filter I have found are for linear system. as, for a standard Kalman, the measure z is z  Hk  x  w, and in my case, it is z  Hkx  wp  pCould anybody tell me if there is a simple way to implement such an extended, sequential Kalman filter The way I tried mixing up both  substituting hkx to hk did not work.p  pPlease tell me if this question would be more adequate on the Math board.p  pHave a nice day,p

Negative 4190 pWhat Im looking to do is find a way that I can have my code return all the combinations of values from a list that add to a variable, returning each answer as a list. For instance,p  precode    targetnumber  8     usingnumbers   [1, 2, 4, 8]     returns     [8]     [4, 4]     [4, 2, 2]     [4, 2, 1, 1]     [4, 1, 1, 1, 1]     [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]     [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] codepre  pAnd so on. Id like repeated values to be discarded, for instance [4, 2, 2], [2, 4, 2], [2, 2, 4] are all technically valid, but Id like just one of these to be shown. Ideally, Id want the code to also return the number of times each number appears in each list, but Im sure I can do that for myself.p

Negative 4190 pIm doing some research on how to improve the coverage and quality of unit level testing, a bug that was found during development with unit testing is easy to fix, but a bug that was found after development in system level testing especially stress testing, can be extremely painful to fix. Im looking at a lot of bug reports with bug fixing code from everywhere about the bugs that was found in system level testing, and trying to come up with a standard, a systematic way to determine whether the bug can be found locally. The reason Im trying to find a systematic way is that deciding whether a system level bug can be found at unit level or not by just reading the bug report, it is really subjective. Different people have different opinions, its like whether a restaurant has good food or not, but with a meaningful reasonable standard like a check list, it would be more convincing. p  pAny suggestions p

Negative 4190 pIve experienced two times now of the No data received issue ever since Ive moved my WordPress site to use RDS. p  pThough I could still connect to my RDS via MySQLWorkbench, but not able to connect to my instance via SSH It shows Operation timed out after this issue has happened each time. p  pDoing ping in Terminal would show that my instance is 100.0 packet loss, and rebooting the instance would not fix this issue neither. Ive set the correct IP for the SSH in the security groups inbound rules, and also checked that my instance is appear to be running on the EC2 console. The browser would still returns No data received..p  pInterestingly, Ive found that stopping the instance, and then restart the instance and the httpd service would fix the issue.

Negative 4190 pI have an application which is written entirely using the FRP paradigm and I think I am having performance issues due to the way that I am creating the streams. It is written in Haxe but the problem is not language specific.p  pFor example, I have this function which returns a stream that resolves every time a config file is updated for that specific section like the followingp  precodefunction getConfigSectionsectionString  StreamltMapltString, Stringgtgt      return configFileUpdated         .thenfilterForSectionChangedsection         .thenreadFile         .thenparseYaml  codepre  pIn the reactive programming library I am using called a hrefhttpsgithub.comjdonaldsonpromhx relnofollowpromhxa each step of the chain should remember its last resolved value but I think every time I call this function I am recreating the stream and reprocessing each step. This is a problem with the way I am using it rather than the library. p  pSince this function is called everywhere parsing the YAML every time it is needed is killing the performance and is taking up over 50 of the CPU time according to profiling. p  pAs a fix I have done something like the following using a Map stored as an instance variable that caches the streamsp  precodefunction getConfigSectionsectionString  StreamltMapltString, Stringgtgt      var cachedStream  this.streamCache.getsection     if cachedStream  null          return cachedStream           var stream  configFileUpdated         .filtersectionFiltersection         .thenreadFile         .thenparseYaml      this.streamCache.setsection, stream     return stream  codepre  pThis might be a good solution to the problem but it doesnt feel right to me. I am wondering if anyone can think of a cleaner solution that maybe uses a more functional approach closures etc. or even an extension I can add to the stream like a cache function.p  pAnother way I could do it is to create the streams before hand and store them in fields that can be accessed by consumers. I dont like this approach because I dont want to make a field for every config section, I like being able to call a function with a specific section and get a stream back.p  pId love any ideas that could give me a fresh perspective p

END PUBLIC KEY   codepre  pSo the private key headertrailer changes based on what PHP version you use. This wouldnt be a real problem, but as it turns out, a system which would create a key header WITH RSA will not be able to user key WITHOUT RSA for e.g., opensslsign Youll get an error stating that the provided key couldnt be coerced into a private key... And this is where it gets messy.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpstls.mbed.orgkbcryptographyasn1keystructuresinderandpem relnofollowhttpstls.mbed.orgkbcryptographyasn1keystructuresinderandpema, there should be a distinction between Private key PEM formats with the RSA in the header an those without, being PKCS1 and PKCS8, i.e. with additinal info about the algorithm etc. or not.p  pI am running into serious problems due to this. The same software written for PHP5.6 cannot run on PHP5.5. On could use a workaround by replacing the 5.5headers with 5.6compatible ones manually, but this would just be a dirty hack. Is there a good way how to deal with thisp  pAt setup, this replacementcode would attempt to create a private key, extract the header and remember it. All keys used at runtime would then be checked. If the headers found would not fit to the local ones, they would need to be exchanged.p  pBut I guess there is some kind of configuration option which I havent managed to find yet where I can configure which format is usedp  pNext, more interesting question What format is created exactly by openssl PKCS1 PKCS8 Is this also configurablep
Negative 4190 pCan you helpp  pIm struggling with a hard to repro issue, inherited code, and a profound lack of Ninject savvy.p  pRunning a Web API app, accessed by an angular client.
