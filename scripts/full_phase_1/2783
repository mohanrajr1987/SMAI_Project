Positive 2783 pCurrently I have ETL software installed running on a machine separate from the destination data warehouse database for security purposes apparently.p  pSo it must send data write records across a network web connection, unfortunately.p  pDue to this final step write the data to a database over the web network being a bottleneck, I have used parallelization to speed things up. I have the ETL software roundrobin the data to 15 copies of a SQL insertion step. It has worked just fine in this regard. 15 connections are opened, the data is written in 20 seconds, and this process is repeated about 1,500 times for the initial data load.p  pRecently, we have switched our date warehouse from Machine 1 to Machine 2. Now Im getting connection errorsp  blockquote   pSpoon error IO Error Connection reset by peer socket write errorp      pMS SQL Studio A transportlevel error has occurred when receiving   results from the server. Error 0  the semaphore timeout period has   expired. Miscrosoft SQL Server, Error 121.p blockquote  pThe process works just fine on Machine 1. Its suddenly failing on Machine 2. Im inclined to believe that the server settings are the issue.p  pAfter talking to our DBA, I was informed that the suspected difference is that Machine 1 has service pack 1 installed for windows and Machine 2 has service pack 2 installed for windows. Apparently the latter may be blocking connections after a certain point to prevent a DDOS attack  or enough open connections may cause the firewall to jump in.p  pHere are my thoughts. The connections are closing just fine. I know this because for testing  I used a SQL DB on HostGator which limits me to 24 simultaneous connections and would let me know if I exceeded it.p  pBut maybe merely opening connections repeatedly, or sessions   is triggering some kind of security ratelimiting on this server.p  pMy question is  how do I proceed from herep  pThe way I see it, I have two optionsp  ol lipMake the ETL software physically close enough to the destination DB so that parallelization 15 connections is not necessary. So far Ive been sending data across the US ping 48ms and across the Atlantic ping 112ms. Im not certain if getting a response time of 1ms possible by putting the two endpoints in the same room would make the SQL write speed much faster. I would love for it to be on the same computer, but dont have the approval.pli lipSomehow circumvent this Machine 2s response of trying to cut off my connection. I mean, sure, maybe its some sort of spam DDOS defense. But honestly  I thought it was quite common for a server to take lots and lots of connections and queries like this.pli ol

Positive 2783 pI am trying to, in Microsoft Access 2013, create a realtime link to data provided by a RESTbased API a hrefhttpportfoliomanager.energystar.govwebserviceshomeapi relnofollowthis API, to be specifica. The ultimate goal is for the data to be available in a query as if it were a local database.p  pHow can this be accomplished Specifically, I am struggling with how to have Access call the API upon request. The only way I can think to achieve a similar result is to write a script that pulls the entire database via the API and translates it to an Accessreadable format, then run that script at set intervals. But Id really like to find a solution that works in real time, even if its a skosh slower than locally caching the database.p

Positive 2783 pIm trying to figure out an issue that Im seeing when you setup a readonly replica.  I have a simple application that will query the readonly replica and I can validate that it hits the correct one by running a servername.  Everything works as planned.  I can failover to the synchronous servers without any issue and my test application still reads from the replica.p  pThe issue I have is that when I reboot the readonly replica, the application never returns back to the readonly replica.  It goes to whatever is set in the routing even after the readonly replica is back online.  New connections from a different server will hit the readonly replica.  If I try a different method of connecting to the AG on the server Im running the test, it will connect to the readonly replica.  The powershell script below will continue to hit a different server. p  pIf I stop the application, wait about 10 or 15 minutes then start up the application, Ill then hit the readonly replica.  If I set my connection string to use poolingfalse.  Then it behaves as its supposed to by hitting the replica once the replica is ready to accept connections.p  pThis is what Im using to test out the readonly replica scenario.p  precodefunction GetReadonlyServer      SqlConnection  NewObject System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection     SqlConnection.ConnectionString  ServerAGOLTPListnr.myenv.localDatabaseAGTestIntegrated SecurityTrueapplicationintentreadonly     SqlConnection.Open     SqlCmd  NewObject System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand     SqlCmd.CommandText  select servername as colName into tmp select colName from tmp drop table tmp     SqlCmd.Connection  SqlConnection     servername  SqlCmd.ExecuteScalar     SqlConnection.Close     servername   for i1 i le 1000000 i               GetReadonlyServer         writehost i         StartSleep s 1      codepre  pWhat am I missing  Or is my test incorrectp

Then, my complete connection string can be called without any missing element. p  pThis solve my earlier issue BUT I also found articles stated that codePersist Security Infocode must not set the True for security purpose. p  pI had consulted my senior and he suggested to put remove the user Id and password from web.config, encrypt both user id and password value, and put them as an App Key, then modify the data source as belowp  precodedata sourcelocalhostinitial catalogDatabase1integrated securityFalsePersist Security InfoTrueUser id0password1 codepre  pWhen I call the data source from my code behind, I should get the encrypted user id and password App Key, decrypt them, then use string.format as below to reformat the string valuep  precodestring strConStr  string.FormatstrConStr, strAppKeyUserId, strAppKeyPassword codepre  pNow my question is, is my senior suggestion a suitable method to cater for Persist Security InfoTrue I feels like its the same but cant really tell the exact impact by applying the suggested method or not. Either way, as long as Im setting codePersist Security InfoTruecode, the password will return back to the connection. p  pAlso, a side note, I cant use codeSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[ConStr].ConnectionStringcode because the code above locate inside a repository solution that doesnt have web.config, only app.config.

Negative 2783 pUsing LINQtoSQL, I would like to automatically create child records when inserting the parent entity.  Basically, mimicking how an SQL Insert trigger would work, but incode so that some additional processing can be done.p  pThe parent has an association to the child, but it seems that I cannot simply add new child records during the DataContexts codeSubmitChangescode.p  pFor example,p  precodepublic partial class Parent       partial void OnValidateSystem.Data.Linq.ChangeAction action              ifaction  System.Data.Linq.ChangeAction.Insert                      Child c  new Child             ... set properties ...             this.Childs.Addc                codepre  pThis would be ideal, but unfortunately the newly created codeChildcode record is not inserted to the database.  Makes sense, since the DataContext has a list of objectsstatements and probably doesnt like new items being added in the middle of it.p  pSimilarly, intercepting the codepartial void InsertParentParent instancecode function in the DataContext and attempting to add the codeChildcode record yields the same result  no errors, but nothing added to the database.p  pIs there any way to get this sort of behaviour without adding code to the presentation layerp  pstrongUpdatestrong Both the codeOnValidatecode and codeInsertParentcode functions are called from the DataContexts codeSubmitChangescode function.  I suspect this is the inherent difficulty with what Im trying to do  the DataContext will not allow additional objects to be inserted e.g. through codeInsertOnSubmitcode while it is in the process of submitting the existing changes to the database.p  pIdeally I would like to keep everything under one Transaction so that, if any errors occur during the insertupdate, nothing is actually changed in the database.  Hence my attempts to mimic the SQL Trigger functionality, allowing the child records to be automatically inserted through a single call to the DataContexts codeSubmitChangescode function.p

Negative 2783 pI have the following XAML markupp  precodeltTextBox xNameMyTextBox TextBinding PathSelectedCustomer.FavouriteProduct.ProductNumber, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged gt ltComboBox xNameMyComboBox ItemsSourceBinding Products DisplayMemberPathProductName     SelectedValueBinding PathSelectedCustomer.FavouriteProduct.ProductNumber     SelectedValuePathProductNumber gt codepre  pMy Views DataContext is bound to a viewmodel containing a public property called SelectedCustomer. Customer objects contain a FavouriteProduct property of type Product and Product objects contain public properties ProductNumber and ProductName.p  pThe behaviour Im looking for is to have the SelectedItem of the ComboBox update the Text in the TextBox and vice versa. ComboBox to TextBox works just fine. Selecting any product in the ComboBox updates the TextBox with the product number of that product. However when I try to go the other way I get som strange behaviour. It only works for the items that come before the selected item. I will try to explainp  pConsider the following list of products [Product Number], [Product Name]p  ol liFantali liPepsili liCoca Colali liSpriteli liWaterli ol  pNow lets say that the SelectedCustomers favourite product is Coca Cola must be a developer. So when the window opens the TextBox reads 3 and the ComboBox reads Coca Cola. Lovely. Now lets change the product number in the TextBox to 2. The ComboBox updates its value to Pepsi. Now try to change the product number in the TextBox to anything higher then the number for Coca Cola 3. Not so lovely. Selecting either 4 Sprite or 5 Water makes the ComboBox revert back to Coca Cola. So the behaviour seems to be that anything below the item that you open the window width from the list in the ItemSource does not work. Set it to 1 Fanta and none of the others work. Set it to 5 Water and they all work. Could this have to do with some initialisation for the ComboBox Potential bug Curious if anyone else have seen this behaviour.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter reading Mike Browns response I have created properties for SelectedProduct and SelectedProductNumber.

Negative 2783 pIn my ASP.NET MVC 2 RC project  Im using AutoMapper to map between a Linq to Sql class Media and a view model MediaVM.

What happens is it appears in its broken portrait form, then rotates correctly as the device is turned.p  pIf I pop the controller back to my portrait view which has an appropriate shouldAutoRotate... then that remains in broken landscape view until the device is returned to portrait orientation.p  pIve also tried removing all the shouldautorotate messages, and instead forcing rotation by transforming the view.

Negative 2783 pI have an Android application that connects to Bluetooth devices somewhat freely.  When I attempt to connect to a device that isnt paired with the phone, a dialog will prompt the user for a passkey.  The passkey is known a priori, but as there is no method to programatically enter it in the standard Android APIs at least, it must be shown to the user then entered.p  pWhat I have presently is a thread that initiates a connection by grabbing a codeBluetoothSocketcode and calling code.connectcode on it.  If pairing is required, that call will block until the user enters a passkey in the dialog.p  pIn order to preempt that, I added to my activitys handler something to display dialogs.  Before sending the message I made a dummy object to pass along, and between sending the message and attempting to connect, called code.waitcode on it, figuring that I could code.notifycode after receiving an codeOnClickcode from the dialog, however Im unable to refer to the handled message in the inner codeAlertDialogcode class, as is the problem in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2028697dialogsalertdialogshowtoblockexecutionwhiledialogisupnetstylethis questiona.p  pI could have it do a call back up to the class holding the thread, but it seems a little clunky, leading me to the core question emis my structure fundamentally broken  How should I go about itemp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1027149popupdialogandroidfrombackgroundthreadAnother related questiona suggests to use the notification system, however it seems much better design here to mirror the passkey dialog with another dialog.p

How to do this Thanks for your help.p  pstrongEDITstrong I want to add the following clarification. I am aware that I can define codebigarray  numpy.zeros10,4code and then fill it up. However, this requires specifying the size of bigarray in advance. I know the size in this case, but what if I do not When we use the code.appendcode function for extending the list in python, we dont need to know its final size in advance. I am wondering if something similar exists for creating a bigger array from smaller arrays, starting with an empty array. Thanksp

Negative 2783 pI am running into a problem with the code.configurecode script for ffmpeg. My linux environment  uses busybox, which only allows for limited set of linux commands. One command which is used in the ffmpeg code.configurecode script is codemktemp ucode, the problem here is the busybox for linux does not recognize the u switch as valid, so it complains about it and breaks the configure process. p  pThis is the relevant code in code.configurecode which uses the codemktemp ucode commandp  precodeif  checkcmd type mktemp then      simple replacement for missing mktemp      NOT SAFE FOR GENERAL USE     mktemp         echo 2XXX.HOSTNAME.UID.      fi  tmpfile     tmpmktemp u TMPDIRffconf.XXXXXXXX2 ampamp         set C exec gt tmp 2gtdevnull          die Unable to create temporary file in TMPDIR.     append TMPFILES tmp     eval 1tmp  codepre  pI am not good with bash scripting at all, so I was wondering if anyone one had an idea on how I can force this configure script to not use codemktemp ucode and use the emreplacementem alternative option that is available in as per the snippet above. Thanks.p  pbtw... simply removing the codeucode switch does not work. Nor does replacing it with codetcode, or codepcode. I believe the codemktempcode has to be bypassed completely.p

Negative 2783 pFor background I have been working on an RPG based off Ray Wenderlichs tutorials. Examplehttpwww.raywenderlich.com1163howtomakeatilebasedgamewithcocos2d. p  pNow I am trying to build a scripted eventCut scene system so that for instance when a player enters a building, the different characters can have a discussion of the current events, before continuing the adventure. My only problem is I cant really visualize how one would implement this. p  pI would guess some sort of one time use trigger, maybe kept in a large switch statement on a singleton somewhere  Which maybe draws all the temp characters   Then the event then deactivates itself. p  pI am just looking for a blueprint of how one would do this. Although programming examples are welcome as well. p

Negative 2783 pHow do I find out where line number or location a piece of javascript is changing a specific piece of content in html  p  pHere it the crux of the issue p  pImagine 3 Divs.  Each gets its content via ajax on page load.  Each of the divs receives its own html and javascript and jquery.  The content of one of the divs is being modified by javascript after it loads, by code that is not part of that divs code.  One of the other divs is making the change.  I need to locate the code that is making the change.  In reality I am working with 12 divs... but I used 3 just to make the example...p  pNormally I would just run firebug and watch the code execution... but as this is all dynamically loaded, I am having trouble locating WHERE this is happening at.  I have performed simple searches for the IDs and classes involved, but have found no conflicting points yet.  Any ideas, help, or tutorials would be appreciated.p
Negative 2783 pI need to print out the elements of a sorted array and also write them to a file. Its an array of objects of Customer classmy own deifinition. The Customer[] review consists of a max of 30 of these objects. Now, the problem is I need the number of elements in the array to do this but I cant pass that variable to the methods as its not a part of the main method nor is it a global variable. The methods are called in the menu method. Both WriteFile and DisplayRecords use numrecords. The reason Im having this problem is because earlier I didnt have the menu method and simply carried the operations out from the main method but apparently the menu method is required.

Negative 2783 pI am trying to get an understanding of the purpose of signed identifiers when using Shared Access Signatures with Blob storage in Azure.  I know that signed identifiers are basically applied at container level and are a named.  Furthermore, I know that they provide any Shared Access Policies to be valid for longer than an hour as opposed to when not specifying a signed identifier. I guess my question is couldnt you just apply a shared access signature at the container level with appropriate permissions and expiry time  Thanks to all that reply.p  hr  pOkay, I think I get now.  So best way to interpret SIs are that they are another level of abstraction for access control at the container level.  Furthermore, they allow you to specify how long policies can be applied before they are revoked.  In both explicit and SI declaration, revocation is pretty much the expiry time.p  pSo my next question is say for instance I have a policy that has been compromised. How exactly do I immediately revoke or change the policy being that Ive defined this policy in my code how would I change it without having redeploy code p

Negative 2783 pI have a django site that servers matplotlib images generated from numbers stored in a mysql database.p  pOne of the views will display up to 5 images. The src value for the images do not link to static files but instead to django views that will generate png images. The images can take up to 5 seconds to load. The same django view function is not being called repeatedly. The five images correspond to different types of plotting methods, each has its own function in django view. p  pWhen multiple requests for the images are sent, the server freezes up. I am developing the site with xampp. I cannot load the site in another tab, or any of the php sites I have running on the same server.p  pIf I try to load all the images with the initial page load the server freezes. If I load the page then request the images separately using jqueryajax and wait patiently then there is no problem. If I quickly make two ajax requests then the server freezes.p  pCan anyone explain what might be the source of the problem  p  pCan I force the serialized execution of the requests on the serverp  pCan I use javascript to delay each request until the prior image is returned and not just when the link is update as is currently the case p  pOr can I put a time limit on the requests to kill these hang ups on the serverp  pThanks. It would be a big help if someone could help me resolve this.p
Negative 2783 pi am implementing a webbased process management engine and i am facing some problemsp  pA process model has different object types with attributes, e.g. br Model Recruitmentbr EmployeeName, Birthday, Departmentbr  ApplicationDate, ...br ApplicantName, Birthday, ...brp  pEvery model has its own database and every object type instance is stored in a separate table within this db. yes, it is pretty denormalized  At runtime it is possible that new models are added which results in additional databases with different schemes to handle. p  pDynamic Data in ASP.NET works with db schemes which are already there. Is it possible to add these new databases works and create the corresponding LINQ2SQL classes at runtimep  pI could renormalize the tables and store all models and the data in the same database so i would know the scheme at builttime, but since it is a multiuser system with a huge number of instances in each table, it is just too complex joins, etc. p  pAny ideas Thanks in advancep  pStefanp

Negative 2783 pI am writing an application with WxWidgets, and have run into an issue with a multiline text control wxTextControl. It is the input field in a chat window, and it needs to be multi line in case the user types a longer message that needs to wrap. I want the send event, e.g. the action that is taken when the Send button is pressed, to be executed when the user presses enter in the control. I have this working using the wxEVTCOMMANDTEXTENTER event, with the wxTEPROCESSENTER style enabled. However, the problem is that while the send command does get executed, a new line character n is also appended to the text this happens after the send command and after I have cleared the text, resulting in an empty field except for a new line. I tried to avoid this by trapping both char and key down events, but for some reason they are not firing. p  pI simply want to avoid the new line being shown at all. Does anyone have any tipsp  pI am developing on Windows, but the application is meant to run on all platforms supported by WxWidgets.p

An alternate approach uses pop1 to  remove the endmost elements from each list, building a solution list which is backwards. Then use reversed to put the result back in the correct  order. That solution works in linear time, but is more ugly.p  pWhy are these two solutions so different Am I missing something, or are they being unnecessarily complicatedp

Negative 2783 pIve run into an issue with our code under clang involving realloc. This code works fine under gcc and visual studio, so Im interested in understanding clangs behavior. Our code does something similar to this error handling etc elidedp  precode allocate way more memory than we need char  memory  malloc500000 int memoryused  0   ... code goes here that fills up the memory, keeping track by  setting memoryused ...   now were done, shrink the memory down to the size it needs memory  reallocmemory, memoryused codepre  pUnder gcc and multiple versions of MSVC, the memory pointer wasnt moved. However, under clang, it appears that it moves the memory, even if the size needed is only 12000 bytes.p  pIs there a particular reason that clang does this The only one I can think of is that perhaps it keeps separate heaps for large and small allocations or something. Otherwise it seems a bit inefficient to move the memory around, when it could just truncate the old memory block and continue using it without having to copy the data at all.p

Negative 2783 pI have a CC project with lots of modules that are meant to be added and removed among installations they are like plugins. I wanted to greatly simplify the module initialization using a technique similar to Linux Kernel  whenever the kernel is linked with some .c module, the moduleinit macro in the .c file registers the module at some global site so it can be callbackd later to get properly initialized.p  pQuestion How do I do this without some nasty linking tricksp  pI tried one approach, roughly followingp  pall modules have moduleinitinitfunc macro inside that expands into something likep  precodestruct initializer    initializer      registerinitfunctioninitfunc     initinstance codepre  pThe registerinitfunction stores the initfunc pointer a list, so it can be initialized by the main program later.p  pProblem here is that the C global variables get all zeroed before use in uncontrollable order, so it happens that some modules are properly registered, while registration of others gets erased when the main module is initialized after them. I also tried some tricks with classstatic vs. global variable initialization order, but either completely misunderstood the description or they dont work.p  pQ Is there some method to somehow ensure initialization order, or a whole other method to do such module initializationp  pThanks exap  p[EDIT] straightforward explanationp  ul limain.c has global variable Yli limain.h describes that global variable or some possible way to modify it function Xli limodule.c calls function X or any other Ymodifying thingy to save something to variable Y as soon as possible, strongwithout being referenced from main.cstrong.li limain.c can after that see that someone called X and saved stuff into Y.li ul  pExample purpose gcc main.c modulescommon.c modulessomespecificpurpose.cp

Negative 2783 pFirst off, sorry if this is a stupid question. I installed codeblocks to try and get to know the program and start working on teaching myself c. I have a MacBook Pro with OS 10.7.3. I ave codeblocks 10.05. When I try to build a Hello world nothing happens. Based on some googling Ive figured out that its because codeblocks doesnt know where to find the debuggercompiler. Further googling yielded me a hrefhttpwiki.codeblocks.orgindex.phptitleInstallingasupportedcompilerMacOSX relnofollowthis pagea which tells me to install Xcode and to fix some things in the codeblocks settings. However, this wiki obviously has not been updated since Apple went to the App store, because the file paths it gives for the compiler do not exist there is no Developer even after installing Xcode. Xcode 4.3.2 was already installed when I installed codeblocks and codeblocks autodetected several compilers. They did not work. If anyone knows where Xcode hides its compilers now that Apple has moved to the app store, I would be much obliged. p
Negative 2783 pIm writing some form views in my Rails 3 app, and I am wondering what others out there might be doing to validate forms on the front end and backend in a DRY way.p  pOf course, it seems there is no way to get around validating on the back end without rails validations. Knowing that, it doesnt seem very DRY to be writing the same validations on the front end. Ive read some other threads about writing validations in 2 places, but unless there is a really good reason to do that, Id rather not.p  pKnowing the magic of rails, there is probably a simple, easy way to validate both front in and back end in a DRY way, but I have yet to discover it. Perhaps a validation gemp  pSo Im thinking that it would be good to use ajax on my front end that calls a validator method on my User model. For example, my username field on the client end listens for jquery keypresses then sends the field contents to my user controller method called checkuser or something like that. Given that there are 5 or more fields per model, I may end up with a lot of extra fieldchecking methods in my controllers... too uglyp  pWould there be any caveats I should know about doing it this way Should I really be concerned about those who disable javascript p

Negative 2783 pIve got a site with 3 pages, one of which has a scrollbar. When switching between a page without and the page with the scrollbar, the navigation bar changes places, and the transition looks terrible. This is because I have a cssdivbased layout, and it centers itself on the window. So, since it will only be covering white space, is there a way to make the scrollbar sit on top of the page, instead of shrinking the page to be next to itp

That means t could be  or  and R could be total different I found out that I should calculate one point into 3D and find out if this point is infront of both cameras, then I have found the correct matrix  I found some of this code at the internet and he just said this no further calculating  codecvMat R1  svd.u  cvMatW   svd.vtcode  and  codet  svd.u.col2 u3code Why is this correct If it isnt  how would I do this triangulation in OpenCV I compared this translation to the translation which is given to me. First i had to transfer the translation and rotation in relationship to camera1 but I got this now But its not the same. The values of my program are just lets call it jumping from plus too minus. But it should be more constant because the camera is moving in a constant circle. I am sure that some axes may be switched. I know that the translation is only from 1 till 1 but I thought I could extract a factor from my results to my comparevalues and then it should be similiar. li ol  pDoes somebody have done something like this before p  pMany people doing a camera calibration by using a chessboard, but I cant use this method to get the extrinsic parameters. p  pI know that visual sfm can do this somehow.

Negative 2783 pI have been trying to refactor our Activiti implementation into using CDI but ran into a number of problems. Ive spent way too much time trying to resolve this already, but I just cant let it go...I think Ive pinned the problem down now, setting up a clean structured war without involving Activiti and have been able to reproduce what I think is the main problem.p  pBasically I have jar1 and jar2, both CDI enabled by including METAINFbeans.xml. Both jars specify a class in METAINFservicestest.TheTest pointing to implementations local to respective jar. jar1 depends on jar2. Also, both jars point to an implementation of javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension, triggering the scenario.

So lets say on day 1 in the afternoon, the PageLoad checks to grab the cached object, but it comes back null, so in that case, bite the bullet and requestbuild the list for the rest of day 1, store it in cache.  Throughout the rest of day 1, no one has to build the object because its in cache and its still valid.p  pDay 1 ends, and its now 400am on day 2.  No one is using any pages.  I want the object that was stored in cache from day 1 to be deleted and rebuilt, so that when people get to the office in the morning, the first person who accesses the page doesnt need to build the list for today, its already done.p  pThe only idea I have would be to look into creating a console application that runs on a Windows scheduled task or something.  But even then, Im not sure how I would be able to interact with the ASP.NET web application from an external application like that.p  pHopefully Im making sense.  Is what Id like to accomplish even possiblep
Negative 2783 pI want to write a app that needs to have 2 things 1. REST API so others can retrieve data and display their own ways 2. The default display is a web page using ASP.NET MVCp  pSo there are some approaches 1. Create 2 separate projects, 1 for Web API and another is ASP.NET MVC. The MVC will talk to Web API to get the data amp render Views 2. Create a single ASP.NET MVC project. And create a class that derives from APIController. Then do the similar thing as above.p  pAs I understand, the performance should be the same for both approaches. But after I read a hrefhttpencosia.comaspnetwebapivsaspnetmvcapis relnofollowthis  articlea , Im not quite sure.p  pQuote from articlep  blockquote   pYou could do that with an ASP.NET MVC API by creating a separate   project for the API, but then youre still paying the performance   penalty for your API requests to filter through MVCs rendering   pipeline. In simple load testing on my local machine, Ive found that   Web API endpoints hosted in console apps are nearly 50 faster than   both ASP.NET controller actions and Web API endpoints hosted within   MVC projects.p blockquote  pIm no expert in ASP.NET so Id love to hear your explanation or advise how to achieve what I want to do.p  pAlso, please enlighten me if I want to use MEF for this project.p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 2783 pThis is more of a discussion question that one that has a straight answer. Im developing a fairly simple scene in OpenGL, and have come across an issue with the class structure Im using. I have a Primitive base class, off of which Im building derived classes such as Cube, Tetrahedron, Sphere etc. The base class holds all of the data about the object, such as its vertices and normals. From here, I have several classes derived from a Model class such as Fence, which then contains several cubes arranged to make the correct structure. Im storing all of the vertices and normals in the heap, and need a way to free the memory. However, when trying to free the memory in the Primitives constructor, I come across an error.p  pI think this is because, when using GLUT, the models are defined outside of glutMainLoop, and so they go out of scope before the program is done using them. Is there a more efficient way to manage memory with vertex arrays in OpenGL Or is there a workaround for this problemp

Negative 2783 pA WPF application consists of a uniform grid of arbitrary size.  Each cell in the grid contains a canvas.

The behaviour Im looking for is a snaptogrid effect.p  pCurrently when I use codeelement.GetValueCanvas.LeftPropertycode the result in NaN.

Negative 2783 pI have an issue with calling a C DLL function from my C code. The C DLL has a function accepting a file name codeconst char code, then opens the file, performs some work on the content reads through the codeFILE code and writes the outcome to another file. Id like to optimize it, so that the disk readwrite operations are not performed, since I have the file to be processed already in a memory stream in my C app. I have a liberty to modify both ends C app and C DLL. C app is .NET 2.0 based.p  pI thought of extending the DLL so that it has a function that accepts and spits out a byte array, so that I could easily codePInvokecode it. The output part seems easy on the C side  instead from writing to a codeFILE code I could just save the consecutive bytes to an array  but the input seems hard. I dont know how to deal on the C side with the obtained byte array to make it into a memory stream and work on that instead on the physical file stream from this point I dont want to rewrite the whole DLL to read from byte array instead of codeFILE code  I want most of the DLL internals to remain unchanged, just to wrap it and tweak insouts. But actually I dont know, maybe there is a better idea to do that.p  pSo strongthe question isstrong how to turn a byte array in C into a codeFILE code without writing it actually to disk and opening a codeFILE code to read this file strongAlternativelystrong how to pass a memory stream from C through codePInvokecode to a C DLL so that it could be easily recognized on the C side and worked with as a codeFILE code again, without physical disk writesreads, inmemory onlyp

Negative 2783 pI have the following situation I receive an Iterator of a certain type and would like to turn it into a particular map. I feel like there is probably a very easy way to do this but I just cannot seem to figure it out  Here is some code to make things easier to understand I shortened the case classes to a bare minimump  precodecase class Futitle String case class Barname String case class Matchf Fu, b Bar case class Resultname String, fus List[Fu]  val input Iterator[Match]  ... codepre  pWhat I would like to have in the end is something like thisp  precodeval output Iterator[Result] codepre  pHere is the tricky part The matches are unique, but naturally, each Fu could be matched so multiple Bars. I basically would like all the matches that have the same Bar to be disassembled and their Fus put into a list. Kind of like a Map[Bar, List[Fu]], except that I have a type for that. The Result class might as well use Bars instead of the name String but I really do not need the other Bar information. But that would not matter too much. And the output type is not all that important either, be it Iterator, Iterable, List, or anything else. As long as the mapping works properly.p  pAt first, I thought groupBy on Iterable would do exactly what I want but I can either not figure out how to use groupBy properly or it is the wrong function for the job  Using map seems to be a good start, but then how do I build the list I can easily turn each Match into a Result, but then I will end up with many Result objects with the same name...p  pThank you very much, any help is appreciatedp  pEdit Maybe I should make clear that it is not about matching the Strings. They are just example attributes for the two case classes. All Fus and Bars have already been matched properly into the Match objects.p

Negative 2783 pThis is a test review question that I am having trouble with. How do you write a method to evaluate an algebraic expression with the operators plus, minus and times. Here are some test queriesp  psimplifyExpression, Result, Listp  pcode simplifyplustimesx,y,times3 ,minusx,y,V,[x4,y2]. V  14codep  pcode simplifytimes2,plusa,b,Val,[a1,b5]. Val  12codep  pcode simplifytimes2,plusa,b,Val,[a1,b5]. Val  8codep  pAll I was given were these sample queries and no other explanation. But I am pretty sure the method is supposed to dissect the first argument, which is the algebraic expression, substituting x and y for their values in the 3rd argument List. The second argument should be the result after evaluating the expression.p  pI think one of the methods should be simplifyV, Val, L  memberVVal, L. Ideally there should only be 4 more methods... but Im not sure how to go about this.p  pWhat I have so far but I dont know what the body should bep  precodesimplifyVar, Value, Lst  memberVarValue, Lst. simplifyplusVar, Value, Lst   simplifyminusVar, Value, Lst  simplifytimesVar, Value, Lst  codepre  pI am not sure what the 5th method should be.p

Negative 2783 pMy partner and I are working for a college level final project, and weve now come to the point where we want to design our database. right now, we have a c JSON serializer and deserializer, and plan to store that into our databasep  pso as i was designing our class schema, my partner mentioned why not just have a table with all the JSON strings I am not sure what to do because intuitively, it does not seem right to have a few fields and then a string. we would select from that table and then deserilize all of the strings and you would get the information. p  phowever, the more i thought about it, Im not sure if theres much of a difference since whenever we need to edit, we would need to edit the JSON string anyways and restore it into the database. I think that this design would make the database just a datadump, but our project is not large scale enough to need a full out design. p  pI know my problem is not very well described, but any thoughts on this would you just store the JSON string or would you have a classic schema i think it really dependsp

My goal is for the dependency to be on a couple fields changing within a table, not anything in the entire table changing.p  pSo as of right now I have set up very similar to this demo a hrefhttpsdeu.wordpress.com20110208activateaspnetmvc3cachingwithdatabasedependency relnofollowhttpsdeu.wordpress.com20110208activateaspnetmvc3cachingwithdatabasedependencyap  pMy question is, can I specify a specific SqlCommand query to depend on  And where would I put this code Id guess global.asax.cs.p  pId imagine it would look something like thisp  precode            SqlCommand cmd  connection.CreateCommand              cmd.CommandText  SELECT FieldName1, FieldName2 FROM mySchema.SomeTable              SqlCacheDependency myDependency  new SqlCacheDependencycmd codepre  pBut then how would would I use that in the controller  Like this maybep  precode        [OutputCacheDuration  Int32.MaxValue, SqlDependency  myDependency] codepre  pAlso, is it required to create the table triggers and cache tableaspnetsqlcachetablesforchangenotification on the database if I use a SqlCommand as the dependencyp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 2783 pI am reading a database Ms Access in C. I am using Ado.net for connection. This database has lot of tables around 100 and each and every table has around 50 columns and 500 rows. Each and every field contain different data type integer, string, bool. What I have to do is I have to convert selected tables and fields to binary format.p  pAfter some literature survey I have planned to read the data by using DataReader since I need to read the variables only for the binary conversion.p  pMy question is p  pIn C programming side what should be my data structure Say If I create separate classes for all tables and define the member variables and methods, How I can make it more effective.

Negative 2783 pIve been working on a universal app. So far everything is good. During final testing it turns out that the app is not working with older OS 5.0 and 5.1.

Negative 2783 pHow to assign to workers a proxy that requires user name  password and a custom user agent using Selenium, PhantomJS driver with Python bindings.p  pIve had good success with creating many workers traversing my test website.

Negative 2783 pI would like to identify groups that contain an indicator.  In the example below I would like to identify codedistrictscode that contain codecounty  othercode.  If any codecounty  othercode in a codedistrictcode then I would like an indicator variable to be code1code, else code0code, for each row in that district.  Below are several attempts at doing so with codesplitcode, codelapplycode and codeanycode, but none of them work.  Perhaps I could extract all rows for which codecounty  othercode, define an indicator as one for that subset, then merge that subset back with the original data set, but I keep thinking there must be an easier way.

Negative 2783 pI have an MVC web api that takes in an attachment on a form and it also requires a text and integer field for the upload. The fields are a stringuserId to verify the uploader and a intrequestId to connect the attachment to the request in the database. Currently it works but with the multipart form data I need to take the fields from the request rather than as parameters in the form submission. My problem is that when the file is saved I need to modify the name of the file with the requestId from the form and the attachment Id from the database so it reads requestIdattachmentIdfileName. The method I have been using involves downloading the file, then getting the data from the request because before the provider is initialized and the file downloaded it always returns null, then renaming the file both in the database and on the file system.

Negative 2783 pI was fooling around with Android layouts to try and get a better understanding of weights, I stumbled across a scenario I couldnt explain though. I have three UI components in a row. A LinearLayout with a weight of 1 and wrapcontent for the width it has a button inside it followed by two buttons with 0dp width and weight of 1. I was expecting that the LinearLayout would be smaller than the width of the buttons but when its rendered, the LinearLayout takes up half of the space and each button gets a quarter of the screen space. This happens even though the first button inside the LinearLayout is much smaller than the space the linear layout uses up.

Negative 2783 pSay you have two unordered sets of checksums, one of size N and one of size M.  Depending on the algorithm to compare them, you may not even know the sizes but can compare N  M for a quick abort if you do.p  pThe hashing function used for a checksum has some chance of collision, which as a layman Im foolishly referring to as strength.  Is there a way to take two sets of checksums, all made from the same hashing function, and quickly compare them so comparing element to element is right out with the same basic chance of collision between two sets as there is between two individual checksumsp  pFor instance, one method would be to compute a set checksum by XORing all of the checksums in the set.  This new single hash is used for comparing with other sets hashes, meaning storage of size is no longer necessary.  Especially since it can be modified for the additionremoval of an element checksum by XORing with the sets checksum without having to recompute the whole thing.  But does that reduce the strength of the sets checksum compared to a brute force comparison of all the original ones  Is there a way to conglomerate the checksums of a set that doesnt reduce the strength as much but still is less complex than a straight comparison of the set elements checksumsp

I do not want to flood the svn integration branch with dozens of small, meaningless commits. For that I know I can use emgit rebase iem.p  pThis command needs to have a commit specified. I have read I can use a tag called emgitsvnem. Indeed, such a committag exists, I can emgit log gitsvn..em, or emgit rebase i gitsvnem.p  pSo far so good, this works. Now, after this introduction, my questionp  pWhat is this emgitsvnem reference A tag A commit Command emgit tag listem shows nothing, and emgitsvnem as a tag does not exist on the other git clones I have used to work.p  pAnother question After I emgit svn dcommitem, will that reference be changed Can it be changed manuallyp  pThanks.p

A sticky note looks like this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUbaIc.png altExample of one padp  pI have a toplevel gtkwindow with a gtktextview. If the background color of the textview is set with the function gtkwidgetoverridebackgroundcolor to a transparant color GdkRGBA where alpha value is smaller than 1, the color of the gtkwindow behind it, becomes more visible.p  pHowever, I dont want to see the gtkwindow, but the applications behind the gtkwindow, such as the browser, libreoffice, or the desktop.p  pIf the gtkwindow is set to a certain transparancy, either with gtkwidgetoverridebackgroundcolor or with gtkwidgetsetopacity, the whole widget, including the window decorations become partially transparent.p  pTo make the relations between the visible objects more clear, I have created a diagram of the different parts, and marked the place where I believe the transparency issue is taking place.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFClCx.gif altRelationships of xpad objects p  pAnybody have any ideas how to make the textview background transparent, without making the window decorations transparent, so I can see whatever is behind this applicationp

Negative 2783 pCurrently I have an app that is very chatty and needs to be supported by a SingletonSee Code below. I upgraded to SignalR 2.0 and I followed the upgrade guide, but after I deploy it out to an environment, sometimes all requests for every protocol fail, and signalr breaks, and when it doesnt break then it is terribly slow to push notifications down to the client from the server, Maybe this has something to do with it using long polling Here is what my server side code looks like.p  pConfiguration Method in Owin Start up classp  precode var hubConfig  new HubConfiguration  hubConfig.EnableDetailedErrors  true  GlobalHost.DependencyResolver.UseSqlServerConfigurationManager.AppSettings[ConnectionString].ToString  app.MapSignalRhubConfig codepre  pAs you can see I am using an SQL Backplane.

Negative 2783 pI would like to kind of reask a question that was asked here two years ago a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq75687773008505Benchmarking symmetric and asymmetric cryptographya but, as I find, was not satisfyingly answered.p  ul lip1 I too would really like to back up the notion that RSAlike asymmetric cryptography is much more expensive than for example performing an HMAC operation with hard numbers. These numbers should be informative with regard to comparability of algorithms.pli lip2 Moreover, I would be interested, in addition to mere mean values of speed, also in information about standard derivationvariance of the measured operation costs. This is because in the protocol in question, predictability of the operation time is actually an issue. This goes so far that if candidate A took significantly longer than B, but the time it took was more reliably predicabtle than the time that B took, then A would be my option of choice.pli ul  pSo my question is this does anybody know of a Benchmarking tool which can give me the desired information 1 and 2 described abovep  pI should also mention that I have tried the speed command of OpenSSL, and found it unsatisfactory. So another question is do any of you know of any further parameters or tools for that which could help me achieve my goal 2 This would also be very welcome.p  pIf you feel you can not help me with the first two questions, the last question would be  how is the information given back by openssl speed rsa to be read exactly what are the input sizes, for example 0.o An answer to this would help me at least achieve goal 1.p  pThanks in advance.p  pKrisp  blockquote   ptldr Do you know of any kind of Benchmark that gives me clear information on the performance of signature algorithms more than just some general mean value, as for example openssl speed will give    If so, please tell me.p blockquote  pOn a side note please answer only if you have something to contribute to the questions as stated above.

Id like to create a customize.php page where the user will click, add to order and it will take them to a page that displays required options to customize that item. from the customize page, they can then click Add to order and it will dump that data into the cart.php file.p  pMy code for moreinfo.php which works perfectly how it isp  precodeltphp  requiredatabase.php connect to the database  ifissetGET[id]      id  GET[id]   result  mysqliquerycon,SELECT  FROM menuitem WHERE idid LIMIT 1      if result          printfError sn, mysqlierrorcon Displays the error that mysql will generate if syntax is not correct.         exit       DYNAMIC PHP PULLING IN THE DATA AND SPITTING OUT THE RESULTS whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult      id  row[id]     description  row[description]     picturepath  row[picturepath]     name  row[name]     price  row[price]     keywords  row[keywords]      dynamiclist  lttable aligncenter width60 border0 cellspacing5 cellpadding8gt                         lttr height150gtlttrgt                         lttrgt                             lttd width30 valigntop aligncentergtltimg styleborder 66cc33 5px solid src  .picturepath .  height200 width200 border1gtlttdgt                             lttd width70 valigntop alignleftgt ltbr gt . name .  ltbr gtltbr gt . price . ltbr gtltbr gtltfontgtDescriptionltfontgtltbr gt  . description .  ltbr gtltbr gtltbr gt                                 ltform idform1 nameform1 methodpost actioncustomize.phpgt                                     ltinput typehidden namepid idpid value  . name .  ampnbspampnbsp  ampnbspampnbsp  . price .  gt                                     ltinput typesubmit namebutton idbutton valueAdd to Ordergt                                  ltformgt                             lttdgt                         lttrgt                         lttr aligncentergtlttdgtlta hrefcart.phpgtView Your Orderltagtlttdgtlttrgt                     lttablegt     echo dynamiclist    mysqliclosecon close the db connection  gt codepre  pNow, Id like to link this to customize.php where the user can make choices.

Negative 2783 pI have two scripts, the first one loads a particular set of child nodes from an XML file via AJAX in order to render a menu in the form of a list of buttons in codeloadMecode. The great thing about this first script is that I have implemented the codesetIntervalcode function which updates the list of buttons automatically anytime the XML file changes. The first scripts rendered buttons are written to trigger the second script on mouse click, which renders a codedivcode filled with the desired nodes sibling nodes in codetoadMecode. This second script also works, but only upon mouse click does it ensure updated data.

Negative 2783 pI am working on writing the Tetris game myself using Java. I am not using any tutorials already containing the code, because I want to try to decompose it myself and see how far I can take it.p  pSo far, not so good. I have stumbled upon the creation on the Shapes. My idea would be to either 1. have each basic shape like the L, the cube, the boat as separate classes extending or implementing Area or Shape so that I can use it as an argument for codeg2.fillLShapecode. 2. each class would have some sort of state variable describing the rotation position, but thats next challenge, figuring out the rotation..p  pSo for Step 1, I have written so far the following drafts of the LShape classp  pDraft ap  precodepublic class LShape implements Shape private Rectangle[][] poc private int rotationState    public LShape      rotationState  0     poc  new Rectangle[3][3]     poc[0][0]  new BrickINITIALX  BRICK, INITIALY, BRICK      poc[1][0]  new BrickINITIALX  BRICK, INITIALY  BRICK, BRICK     poc[2][0]  new BrickINITIALX  BRICK, INITIALY  2  BRICK, BRICK     poc[2][1]  new BrickINITIALX, INITIALY  2  BRICK, BRICK         .....all the Shapes methods which Im not overriding cause I dont know how codepre  pIn the main class I am calling in the paint method     codeg2.filllShape  where lShape is a LShape objectcode And the trouble is an exception is thrown about the codegetPathIteratorcodep  pOR Draft bp  precodepublic class LShape extends Area  public LShape        addnew Areanew BrickINITIALX  BRICK, INITIALY, BRICK     exclusiveOrnew Areanew BrickINITIALX  BRICK, INITIALY  BRICK, BRICK     exclusiveOrnew Areanew BrickINITIALX  BRICK, INITIALY  2  BRICK, BRICK     exclusiveOrnew Areanew BrickINITIALX, INITIALY  2  BRICK, BRICK   codepre  pIn this case when I call the codeg2.filllShapecode there is no exception and the Shape is drawn, only that I dont know how to move it. Parts of the Area are the Brick objects which are Rectangles, so I could try to access the codesetLocationcode method on each Brick in the Area, but  I dont know how to access it.p  pSo I guess I need help either to figure out how to make the Shape implementation of a Tetris Shape not to throw the exceptions, meaning implementing all the required methods and actually showing up on the JPanel..and then I will worry about the rotation. OR figure out how to make the Area extension of a Tetris Shape to move around. p  pThanks,p

I dont have enough reputation to post an image.p  pFor some but not all countries I will have province data, so a city will belong to a province, and the province to a country. For the rest, I shall just know that the city belongs to a country.p  pIssue 1 Concerning the countries that I do have province data, I was looking for a solution that will disallow a city to belong to a country and at the same time to a province of a different country.p  pI preferred to enforce through a check constraint that either province or country but NOT both are not null in city. Looks like a neat solution.p  pThe alternative would be to keep both province and country info within the city and enforce consistency through a trigger.p  pIssue 2 I want to disallow that a city is a capital to a country to which it does not belong. That seems impossible without a trigger after my solution to issue 1 because there is no way to directly reference the country a city belongs to.p  pMaybe the alternative solution to issue 1 is better, it also simplifies future querying.p

Negative 2783 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am building a multitenant approx. 100 paying clients Customer Relationship Management application for a specific industry niche.  The CRM will store data about my clients prospects and customers or rather, contacts.  The data that will be stored will be a combination of known  standard data Id, Name, Address, Phone, etc. and configurable  dynamic data defined by each client.  In other words, there will be a form builder allowing my clients to add more data about each contact.  Furthermore, they will need to be able to import both the standard and dynamic data from legacy systems.  The key requirement in addition to searching through the standard data, clients should be able to search through dynamic data to find matches to queries, or even create reports that include  summed  grouped by this dynamic data.p  pI would prefer to use Microsoft Azure since I am a C developer and have some familiarity with the user interface, even if Im not widely experience in all the tools Azure has to offer.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pMy hope was to use reflection emit to create instances of dynamic classes representing contacts with both standard and dynamic properties, then serialize those instances into JSON and into Azure Blobs.

Negative 2783 pI am currently experiencing issues when drawing and scaling sprites.p  pI am loading my assets from a textureatlas, which I packed no problem with the LibGDX texture packer gui tool. My texture atlas image currently looks like this. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCZhPp.png altpack iamgep  pThese images are supposed to be buttons, but as you can see, the image is very small, so when the sprites are loaded, they load a sprite of say, 34x16 pixels. When I render these buttons, on a canvas of 1920x1080, they are much too small. I use codesprite.scaleint scalecode to scale the sprites, but when I scale them, they appear blurry. What I would like to happen, is when they are scaled, each pixel is scaled proportionally, keeping the pixelated effect on the button, rather than a blurry resized image from a really small texture. I currently render the sprites using codesprite.renderSpriteBatch batchcode. Is this the proper way of rendering a sprite, after they are loaded using codeatlas.createSpriteString namecode I am new to using sprites, and loading textures from a textureatlas, so i am wondering if this is the correct way of doing things.p  pAlso, when I initialize my game, I load numerous different codeSpritecode objects from a TextureAtlas. Each sprite holds a texture that will represent a game object, however it is my understanding that you render a sprite using codesprite.renderSpriteBatch batchcode, so therefore I could only use a sprite, loaded from the codeTextureAtlascode for one game object, because I would also have to set the scale, and position of the sprite, as it represents the game object. I am used to loading a codeTexturecode, then rendering this texture using codebatch.rendercode, at a given position, but I dont see how this is possible if I am using a sprite. Even if I use codebatch.renderSprite, x, ycode, I am unable to scale the sprite properly, because as I mentioned before, I would like to scale the sprite while maintaining a pixelated effect, and even so, using the codeSprite.scalecode method, this would scale the Sprite object as a whole, making it impossible to use the codeSpritecodes texture multiple times for numerous game objects.p  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pThe code I am currently using to renderload the sprites is as followsp  pLoading from TextureAtlasp  precodepublic static TextureAtlas atlas  new TextureAtlasGdx.files.internaldatatexturepackoutputpack.pack  public static Sprite sprite  atlas.createSpritebuttonUp sprite.setScale10 codepre  pRendering Sprite GdxGame.WIDTHHEIGHT are 1920x1080. Though the Desktop window is scaled down from that size. Thus, everything is rendered as if the screen were 1920x1080.p  precode    batch  new SpriteBatch     camera  new OrthographicCameraGdxGame.WIDTH, GdxGame.HEIGHT     camera.position.setGdxGame.WIDTH2, GdxGame.HEIGHT2, 0     camera.setToOrthofalse, GdxGame.WIDTH, GdxGame.HEIGHT  public void renderfloat delta     Gdx.gl.glClearGL10.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT     batch.setProjectionMatrixcamera.combined     batch.begin      camera.update     sprite.drawbatch      batch.end  codepre  pAfter further investigation, I have discovered that I can use codeSprite.setSprite spritecode to make codeSprite xcode a copy of codeSprite ycode, and therefore render each sprite multiple times. However, this does not solve the issue of scaling the sprite. I must emphasize further that when rendering a scaled sprite, the scaling is not done by pixel, meaning that it is blurry. But, when rendering a codeTextureRegioncode, like codebatch.drawTextureRegion, x, y, width, heightcode if the width and height are greater than that of the original texture, it will scale each pixel, rather than blur the whole thing to try and make it look better. The following is an image of the blurriness I am talking aboutp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMXakR.png altenter image description herep  pNotice how this sprite is scaled to be blurry, even though the original image is small, and pixelated. p

Negative 2783 pThere is a data driven web application developed using JSF.

Negative 2783 pI have been doing a lot of research on the web and havent come up with a great solution going forward on what I am trying to accomplish.  Essentially the goal is to create something like shutterfly where the user picks a background image, some pictures, some text, some layouts and it will show it in the browser and have the image be downloadable of what they have created. p  pIt seems like an extremely common use case but I cant seem to find a workflow that fits my requirements.  I have looked at the HTML5 canvas and that can work however it seems like the text is ugly and overall difficult to work with. Having multiple imagestext blocks and have all of it be customizable to the user I cant seem to get to work properly.p  pIdeally I would be able to in the browser just use HTML to create the picture and then when the user selects everything, I would have the server side generate the image based upon the specifications.  However I cant seem to find a library for nodejs that fits this desire.p  pI am new to working with image manipulation so I am unsure on what the best approach would be.p

It runs very poorly because its firing on every window resize, and Im wondering if there is a cleaner way to do this where the functions would only fire once when they hit the window size. p  pAlso  this is only to size gridster strongdownstrong, so if you size out it will not expand, I have not tried building those functions yet. p  pAny pointers or suggestions in using something that maybe isnt listening to every single instance of a window resize would be super helpful.p  pThanksp

Negative 2783 pI have a program that utilizes Path2D.Float to draw a vector object a large fractal design.  My code allows zooming and panning.  I have an axis object that has methods to convert world coordinates pairs of doubles to display coordinates pairs of floats based on the current scaling settings stored in the axis object.p  pAnyways, the vector graphic is large and detailed and contains many line segments in world coordinates.  Each time the user zooms or pans, new Path2D objects are created and rendered to the screen.  p  pEverything is perfectly smooth when zoomed out.  The problem occurs when I zoom in to a certain depth.  Apparently the Path2D lines get very long and this slows down their rendering even though the vast majority is outside the viewing area.  Its not my conversion algorithms consuming resources.  I profiled it and its definitely the Java graphics drawing algorithm thats slowing down due to the size of the lines in comparison to the small clipping region.  p  pI was hoping there was a way to get Java to deal with the clipping of large lines automatically.  I do call setClip from the graphics object before drawing.  I dont see whats taking so much time.  Is there something problematicinefficient about the clipping algorithm when lines are long in comparison the clipping rectangle  I dont think Im zooming so far that my conversion from world coordinates to display coordinates is causing overflow.  Ill have to check for this.  If thats the case Ill try using Path2D.double instead.p  pAnyways, any help appreciated.  Im sure Ill eventually figure this out but I hope someone thats encountered the same problem can give me a pointer so it doesnt take so long to figure out.p

Negative 2783 pI am creating a web server that manages subscriptions to live data. This data is being streamed to nodejs over TCP and then I stream to client that has subscribed to particular topic over websockets using Socket.io.p  pHere is the workflow. p  pClient sends a subscribe request on a particular topic. Nodejs application will proxy this subscription to java application that will then start pushing data to nodejs over TCP.  Java application initiates 9 different socket connections for each possible category of news that can be listened on, one category per socketp  pAn important thing to mention is that this data can be huge because when client subscribes they first get historical dataup to 45MB and every subsequent push contains a small increment.p  pThe problem that I am having is that on initial push nodejs application uses over 100 of CPU. Initially I thought that the issue was with parsing data that was being sent to me. After days of debugging I found out that when commenting out codesocket.emitdata.topic, datacode CPU drops to 1  3. That makes me believe that the issue that I am having is with socket.io. p  pAm I misusing socket.io here Are there any alternatives that can push on different topicschannels Is there something wrong

I have the case where my code isp  precodeclass A  class B  public A  class C  public A codepre  pand I use class codeAcode as a polymorphic parameter type for passing in codeBcode or codeCcode sub typesp  precodeAccepts B and C objects void aMethodA a codepre  pHowever, I gave codeAcode a virtual destructor this is the only reason A and B and C contain a vtable pointer.p  pSo my question is, if I hadnt declared A with a virtual destructor, then A wouldnt be polymorphic I wouldnt be able to pass objects of type B or C in codeaMethodcodep  pSo is nonpolymorphic inheritance just about sharing code, whereas polymorphism the base class must have a vtable allows passing sub types as arguments of the base class typep

Negative 2783 pIm using Jython and trying to get the user to input a password.  However, I would like it to show an asterisk rather than the characters that the user is inputting.  I managed to do something similar using getpass, but it required you to type into the cmd line, and it would just not show anything rather than an asterisk.p  pIm looking to have the user type into a dialog box the input command brings up a box that would be perfect.  For example, thisp  precodeimport sys  password  inputPlease enter your password  if password  None     if the user hits cancel     sys.exit0 codepre  pHowever, it does not mask the text.  I am able to do this using the java aspect of jython like sop  precodeimport javax.swing.JOptionPane as JOP import javax.swing.JPasswordField as JPF import sys  pwdF  JPF choice  JOP.showConfirmDialogNone, pwdF,     Please enter your password,     JOP.OKCANCELOPTION  if choice  JOP.CANCELOPTION     sys.exit0 password  pwdF.getText codepre  pA problem I have with this is that I cant get the cursor to default to the text field instead it starts on the ok button.  Primarily, though, Id like a more pythonic way of doing this.p  pI messed around quite a bit with java.swing, using layout and add components however, I didnt understand it enough to tweak it in a way that would work.p  pDoes anyone know a method of creating an input box with masked text different from the java version I postedp  pThanks.p

Ive already got the rows in the form feeding dynamically from custom post types so that there is a row for each theme that exists, and one will be added each time a theme is added... This is where the problem comes in because I need to find a way to dynamicize the mysql table in the same way, where Ill need to create a new set of columns for each new theme dynamically.p  pSo given that information, Ive followed a hrefhttpcode.tutsplus.comtutorialscustomdatabasetablescreatingthetablewp28124 relnofollowthis tutoriala in order to create my table dynamically via the WordPress API through a plugin. What Im unclear on is how I can manipulate the portion of the statement below to have it create a new column for each post in my custom post type of Themes. I think if Im able to figure that bit out Ill be able to sort out the rest as well.p  precode  sqlcreatetable  CREATE TABLE wpdbgttrackerentrysubmission        themeid bigint20 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement   charsetcollate  codepre

When deserializing BSON, Im using the [IgnoreExtraElements] tag to filter out fields I dont really care about editing.

Negative 2783 pIve recently realized that RequiredAttribute does not work on enum fields.

When I dont select anything on ddlOfficers I get validation warning on submitting. But I dont get any warning when I dont select anything on ddlApplicationType. And I probably know the cause of the problemIf I compare the two select elements I can see that the first option Choose of ddlOfficers has no value specified, which when selected causes the validation to complain. But the first option of ddlApplicationType has value of None. So the validation engine sees that the selected option has a value and simply ignores it.

Negative 2783 pIve created a custom button in firefox by following some tutorials in developer forums. Anyway what the button currently does is that it will open a specific url which is specified in embutton.jsem file.

For example, if my browser is in emwww.abc.comem then when I click the button it should open emwww.abcx.comem or emwww.abc.comxem in a new tab. How can I edit the embutton.jsem to achieve thisp

If I enable depth testing in the initialization function as the tutorial I am following says to do, faces overlap incorrectly as if depth testing hadnt been enabled.

Negative 2783 pIm wondering how does all this stuff with method references and functional interfaces works on lower level. The easiest example is where we have some Listp  precodeListltStringgt list  new ArrayListltgt list.addb list.adda list.addc codepre  pNow we want to sort it with Collections class, so we can callp  precodeCollections.sortlist, StringcompareToIgnoreCase codepre  pBut if we define custom comparator it could be something likep  precodeComparatorltStringgt customComp  new MyCustomOrderComparatorltgt Collections.sortlist, customCompcompare codepre  pThe problem is that Collections.sort takes two parameters List and Comparator. Since Comparator is functional interface it can be replaced with lambda expression or method reference with the same signature parameters and return type. So how it works that we can pass also reference to compareTo which takes only one parameter and the signatures of these methods dont match How are the method references translated in Java8p

Negative 2783 pI have a large set 2000 of time series data that Id like to display using d3 in the browser.

I feel like a good solution would be to select a sample of the data and then use some kind of interpolation spline, polynomial, etc., this is the part I know how to do to draw a curve that is reasonably similar to the actual data.p  pHowever, its not clear to me how I ought to go about selecting the subset. The data shown below has rather flat regions where fewer samples would be needed for a decent interpolation, and other regions where the absolute derivative is quite high, where more frequent sampling is needed.  p  pTo further complicate matters, the data has gaps where the sensor generating it was failing or out of range, and Id like to emkeepem these gaps in the chart rather than interpolating through them. Detection of the gaps is fairly simple though, and simply clipping them out after drawing the entire data set with the interpolation seems like a reasonable solution.p  pIm doing this in JavaScript, but a solution in any language or a mathematical answer to the problem would do.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFnN3e.png altthe data in questionp

And y will be the total number of rolls. However the result I get does not tend to 133 over many tries. Is this because I am only counting 1s turning up in a row and not 1 OR 2 OR 3 turning up 3 times in a row Or what is the mistake here. Thanksp

Negative 2783 pHello in one of my project I am using the skrollr.js parallax plugin in one of my headers. Im using it on a header which is under my menu 70px height. p  pI m using the following skrollrkeyframes p  precodeskrollrkeyframes articlecontainertopanimation      topbottom          backgroundposition center 650px          top          backgroundposition center 70px       codepre  pand the initial position of my header background image is also set to center 70px so that I dont get a jump when skrollr is loaded so if my bg image was initialy set to 0px there would be a 70px jump when skrollr is loaded.p  pWhat I would like now is to start the parallax effect before these 70px from the menu are scrolled. I know I can get this result by using the bottomtop keyframe p  precodeskrollrkeyframes articlecontainertopanimation      topbottom          backgroundposition center 650px          top          backgroundposition center 70px          bottomtop          backgroundposition center 200px        codepre  pBut this is then slightly changing the initial backgroundposition for some reason the background position starts around 80px, depending on the resolution, instead of 70px so I get a 10 px jump which I cant control since it changes from one resolution to another. Is it not possible to start the animation when the image is in the focus area  p  pWhat I mean by this is that the parallax effect should start on first scroll. Here is an image to illustrate p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1vZmO.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 2783 pIm trying to represent overlaps between about a dozen different data sets.  Multiple sets can overlap at once in different combinations.  I was thinking a good visualization would be a Sunburst type graph, but the basic usage doesnt seem to have a way to create the gaps.  One method was to essentially structure the data to have empty areas that could then be given a display attr value of none.  The problem is that if I have a section far down outside the graph, I have to nest it in a large number of these empty bits.p  precode    name set1,    children [     name set2,     children [       name set3,       size 100     ]   ]  codepre  pI also have to have other special values to represent a remainder that isnt overlapped by child nodes.  It works fine as is, but the data structure is pretty big and ugly and inefficient.  I was hoping I was just too new to d3 to not be seeing a way to simplify this.  Some way I can specify the depthlevel of a node in the data itself or modify it as the nodes are processed.p

Negative 2783 pIm working on a project which uses the Liquid template language.  I have a page with iframes showing some rendered liquid templates and an editor section.

Negative 2783 pSo I am making a physics engine that only uses rectangles axisaligned bounding boxes as shapes. I have implemented a method from christer ericsons book that returns the collision time and normal of two moving aabbs. I also have made another method that takes two aabbs velocities, positions and a normal that responds to the collision and give the aabbs new velocities. p  pThe actual problem now is is that I dont know how the loop, that checks the collisions between all aabbs and responds to them, should look like. Simply I dont understand how to order the collisions by the time of impact, and which collision I should respond to. p  pA loop written in pseudo code that shows how to order all collisions would be really helpful. p  pAnother thing Ive mentioned is that its possible thata moving box could bounce between two static boxes hundreds of times in a single frame if its velocity is really high, how do you handle thatp

Negative 2783 pIm trying to find the best way to display this stacked area chart in ggplot2 in R. My issue is the amount of variables Im trying to display while also keeping the chart readable.

My code as it stands is thisp  precodefull lt ggplotdatadf, aesxYear, yvalue  geomareaaesfillvariable  themelegend.positionright  themelegend.titleelementblank codepre  pI thought I could add something like this to achieve an effect of giving the entire graph a gradient theme but then singling out a couple variables with a separate fill color entirely.p  precodefull  scalefillgrey   scalefillmanualvaluescXval1red, Xval2blue codepre  pIf anyone knows how to actually do this Id be extremely grateful. Alternately, if you can think of a better way entirely to display this data I would be open to hearing suggestions.p
Negative 2783 pThis is more of a thinking question. I have been working around different timedate formats, and I noticed that it seems to be preferred to store datetime objects as variables with unique classes like ISOdate or POSIXct in databases like Mongo, MySQL, postegen. p  pI get why one would want to convert to such a format when analyzing data, but I was wondering whats the advantage for when I store it in that format in a databasep  pDo these formats tend to take less space than conventional numbers I cant seem to find an answer online.p

Negative 2783 pIm maintaining a project that uses DevExpress ASP.NET v13.2 controls and within it I have an ASPxGridView that displays all sorts of information. Recently when doing some work on the layout of this grid, I noticed that the column widths are not being saved at all. It seems only column ordering and column visibility are being stored.p  pHeres what Ive got clientsidep  precodeltdxwgvASPxGridView IDASPxGridView runatserver                     AutoGenerateColumnsFalse                     ClientInstanceNamegrid                     KeyFieldNameClientId                     Width100                     OnHtmlRowPreparedASPxGridViewHtmlRowPrepared                     OnCustomCallbackASPxGridViewCustomCallback                     OnClientLayoutgridViewClientLayoutgt   ltSettingsBehavior ColumnResizeModeNextColumn AllowFocusedRowTrue gt   ltSettingsCookies EnabledTruegtltSettingsCookiesgt   ltSettingsText EmptyDataRowNo queries found for the current criteria. gt   ltSettings ShowFilterRowTrue ShowGroupPanelTrue ShowFilterRowMenuTrue GridLinesNone gt   ltClientSideEvents BeginCallbackOnGridBeginCallback                     EndCallbackOnGridEndCallback                     ColumnResizedfunctions, e                                     e.processOnServer  truegt   ltClientSideEventsgt           ltColumnsgt codepre  pSo, according to the snippet above, whenever a column is resized, the event is processed server side and sent through to the girdViewClientLayout method this works.p  pHeres what girdViewClientLayout looks likep  precodeprotected void gridViewClientLayoutobject sender, ASPxClientLayoutArgs e    if in saving mode continue.   compare GridViews current layout e.LayoutData info to that stored on Db for this user.   if different, save new layout to Db.   refresh layout, i.e. read new user layout from Db.   otherwise ignore as to reduce unnecessary extra Db interaction.  codepre  pSo according to my understanding, e should contain a property called LayoutData which is a human unreadable logical string that should have layout information such as columns visible, column order, grouping, column widths, etc that only the gridview can understand. However, stepping through the flow, I notice the string passed to gridViewClientLayout has no column width information. My above method ignores the new layout information as technically it sees no change to the layout data and therefore does not save the layout It then refreshes the grid reads the users layout from the Db which means column widths are reset to that of whatever is saved in the Db.p  pHeres an example of the LayoutData string before width is resizedp  precodepage1sort1a20conditions1413436383103123133143153193203213223233visible24f0f3t0f16f2f16t1f16t6f16t7f16t4t5f10f9t11t12f14f13t8f16f13f16width24ee60pxeeeeeeeee300pxeeeeeeeeeee codepre  pHeres what the LayoutData looks like being passed to girdViewClientLayout when rezising occursp  precodepage1sort1a20conditions1413436383103123133143153193203213223233visible24f0f3t0f16f2f16t1f16t6f16t7f16t4t5f10f9t11t12f14f13t8f16f13f16width24ee60pxeeeeeeeee300pxeeeeeeeeeee codepre  pExactly the same Im expecting something like the above string but with more sections ending in px.

Ill be implementing an XML alternative soon but even then, it too requires column width information which is not stored in ASPxClientLayoutArgs.LayoutData meaning Id have to implement a dirty hack to inject this column width information into the XML structure. But thats a problem for another day.p  pAnyone have any suggestions This is not a huge problem, I mean its just column widths, but my scrum master would really like it included in our next deploy which is being delayed by this problem. Hes a really cool guy and Id really hate to disappoint him with something so small and insignificant.p  pThanks guys, JeanPierrep

Negative 2783 pI implemented phpCAS as a Service Provider in my app that is running Laravel 5.1.

Negative 2783 pI am building an ASP.NET 5 vNext site that will host dynamic pages, static content, and a REST Web API.  I have found examples of how to create middleware using the new ASP.NET way of doing things but I hit a snag.  p  pI am trying write my own authentication middleware.  I would like to create a custom attribute to attach to the controller actions or whole controllers that specifies that it requires authentication.  Then during a request, in my middleware, I would like to cross reference the list of actions that require authentication with the action that applies to this current request.  It is my understanding that I configure my middleware before the MVC middleware so that it is called first in the pipeline.  I need to do this so the authentication is done before the request is handled by the MVC controller so that I cant prevent the controller from ever being called if necessary.  But doesnt this also mean that the MVC router hasnt determined my route yet  It appears to me the determination of the route and the execution of that routes action happen at one step in the pipeline rightp  pIf I want to be able to determine if a request matches a controllers action in a middleware pipeline step that happens before the request is handled by the controller, am I going to have to write my own url parser to figure that out  Is there some way to get at the routing data for the request before it is actually handled by the controllerp  pEdit Im beginning to think that the a hrefhttpsluisfsgoncalves.wordpress.com20150729aspnet5routingparti relnofollowRouterMiddlewarea might be the answer Im looking for.  Im assuming I can figure out how to have my router pick up the same routes that the standard MVC router is using I use attribute routing and have my router really authenticator mark the request as not handled when it succeeds authentication so that the default mvc router does the actual request handling.  I really dont want to fully implement all of what the MVC middleware is doing.  Working on trying to figure it out.  a hrefhttpsgithub.comaspnetRoutingblobdevsrcMicrosoft.AspNet.RoutingRouterMiddleware.cs relnofollowRouterMiddlewarea kind of shows me what I need to do I think.p  pEdit 2 Here is a template for the middleware in ASP.NET 5p  precodepublic class TokenAuthentication          private readonly RequestDelegate next          public TokenAuthenticationRequestDelegate next                      next  next                   public async Task InvokeHttpContext context                       do stuff here               let next thing in the pipeline go                await nextcontext               do exit code           codepre

Unfortunately, this code by Slack is emnotem an npm module that makes it easy to do.  The project has a bin folder and a src folder full of coffee script, etc. that grunt builds to .js files.pli lipThe Slack project code has its own dependencies.

Negative 2783 pBinary onehot also known as oneofK coding lies in making one binary column for each distinct value for a categorical variable. For example, if one has a color column categorical variable that takes the values red, blue, yellow, and unknown then a binary onehot coding replaces the color column with binaries columns colorred, colorblue, and coloryellow. I begin with data in a pandas dataframe and I want to use this data to train a model with scikitlearn. I know two ways to do the binary onehot coding, none of them satisfactory to me.p  ol lipstrongPandas and getdummiesstrong in the categorical columns of the dataframe. This method seems excellent as far as the original dataframe contains strongallstrong data available. That is, you do the onehot coding before splitting your data in training, validation, and test sets. However, if the data is already split in different sets, this method doesnt work very well. Why Because one of the data sets say, the test set can contain fewer values for a given variable. For example, it can happen that whereas the training set contain the values red, blue, yellow, and unknown for the variable color, the test set only contains red and blue. So the test set would end up having fewer columns than the training set. I dont know either how the new columns are sorted, and if even having the same columns, this could be in a different order in each set.pli lipstrongSklearn and DictVectorizerstrong This solves the previous issue, as we can make sure that we are applying the very same transformation to the test set. However, the outcome of the transformation is a numpy array instead of a pandas dataframe. If we want to recover the output as a pandas dataframe, we need to or at least this is the way I do it 1 pandas.DataFramedataoutcome of DictVectorizer transformation, indexindex of original pandas data frame, columns DictVectorizer.getfeaturesnames and 2 join along the index the resulting dataframe with the original one containing the numerical columns. This works, but it is somewhat cumbersome.pli ol  pstrongIs there a better way to do a binary onehot encoding within a pandas dataframe if we have our data split in training and test setstrongp

Negative 2783 pJust a little introduction, with simple words. In C, iterators are things on which you can write at least the dereference operator codeitcode, the increment operator codeitcode, and for more advanced bidirectional iterators, the decrement codeitcode, and last but not least, for random access iterators we need operator index codeit[]code and possibly addition and subtraction.p  pSuch things in C are objects of types with the according operator overloads, or plain and simple pointers.p  pcodestdvectorltgtcode is a container class that wraps a continuous array, so pointer as iterator makes sense. On the nets, and in some literature you can find codevector.begincode used as a pointer.p  pThe rationale for using a pointer is less overhead, higher performance, especially if an optimizing compiler detects iteration and does its thing vector instructions and stuff. Using iterators might be harder for the compiler to optimize.p  pKnowing this, my question is why modern STL implementations, lets say MSVC 2013 or libstdc in Mingw 4.7, use a special class for vector iteratorsp

Negative 2783 pI have an application that is intended to target a wide family of Intel processors, from archaic Pentium, Pentium II to modern Haswell, Skylake. It features specific code paths tailored for the various extensions to the x86 instruction set SSE, AVX, etc.. However, I only have access to computers dating back to Sandy Bridge and can not verify that the application will actually run on the oldest architectures supported. While it is true that CPUs that old are unlikely to be useful for any purpose, it would be good from a code quality point of view to know that a function named codemyroutinesse2code does not accidentally use instructions from SSE3 or such.p  pWhat approaches do people usually take when facing this kind of problem Are there automated tools that will scan functions and ensure illegal instructions are not present Are there services web or otherwise that provide access to legacy computer architectures for testing and debuggingp

Negative 2783 pIm trying to use libgit2 for taking diffs of my repositories. One of my repos doesnt play well with libgit2 in this regard.
