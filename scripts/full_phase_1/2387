Positive 2387 pIm creating simple voting system, where main restrictions arep  ul lievery person can vote only onceli lieach vote must be strictly anonymousli lisystem must be spreaded with covering situations where some of vote terminals wont have access to system network all the time so they will send votes periodically to main node.li ul  pBy strictly anonymous I mean that there cant be anyone on earth with access to data who voted on what. There must be information about who already voted but cant be information what he voted.p  pThis is simple to achieve by creating 2 buckets database tables or something of data, one with information about user that is voting, second with vote but no user data and allow inserting records only into both buckets at once, but only if particular user is not listed in first bucket already. That solution will work, but only if every node of the system can access main database all the time.p  pSo there is second approach to sign each vote with some user data in way that each vote created by that user will have exact same sign but there will be no way to find user using that sign. I dont know how to create that kind of sign.p  pIt can be based on something that only user have or something that only user knows, but it is not stored anywhere else and can be verified if it is legit. Some kind of certificate that wont reveal person it belongs to and can be invalidated if for example someone stole it.p

Positive 2387 pClient encrypts the message using the X.509 certificate and sends the encrypted message to my web server. The client has provided a X.509 certificate without a private key exported as DER encoded binary X.509 .cer. Now my task is to decrypt the message using the X.509 certificate that I have.p  pWhenever I try to decrypt the message I get The private key does not exist exception which is expected as the certificate does not contain the private key. Is it feasible to decrypt the message using the x.509 certificate without the private keyp  pSecondly, if client provides the password separately for the certificate can I create an instance of  X509Certificate2 and use it to decrypt the message like p  precodeX509Certificate2 c  new X509Certificate2filename, password codepre

Positive 2387 pSo I have a kind of interesting issue. I have a field in my data store which must take exactly 160 bits of information. Some users will choose to make this data encrypted, some wont, so some of those 160 bit fields will be ciphertext some will be plaintext. A boolean will indicate which one the user is using. The important thing here is that I need this field to be exactly 160 bits long. However, a 128bit cipher will mean I have to put in 256 bits in as plaintext, which is fine, just use a buffer string, but this means that the output is 256 bits when what is stored must be exactly 160 bits. And I cant simply cut off the ciphertext or that would mess up the decryption. So how can I use a 128bit block cipher like AES note it MUST be a 128 bit block cipher, I cant change that to encrypt 160 bits into 160 bits such that it can be decrypted back into the original 128 bits.p  pstrongJust a note The field in the database must stay exactly 160 bits. No this can not change. The size of the blocks can not change either its going to be a 128bit cipher no matter what. No we cant store it in a different field if it is ciphertext then if it was plain text, it must be the same 160 bit field.strongp

The Protect method performs the strongappropriate operationstrong and   securely protects the data. Ciphertext data produced by this method   can strongonly be decipheredstrong by the Unprotect method.p      pThe purposes parameter is an optional list of reasons that can lock   the ciphertext to a specific purpose. This parameter lets you isolate   cryptographic operations performed by different subsystems within an   application. A malicious client should not be able to get the result   of one subsystems Protect method and feed it as input to another   subsystems Unprotect method, which could compromise application   security. The purposes parameter helps ensure that protected data can   only be used by the component that originally generated it.   Applications should make sure that each subsystem uses a unique   purposes list.p blockquote  pso can anyone shed some light on what cipher this uses to protect the data sent into it Any best practice on usage would be useful too.

I will be using GC.GetTotalMemory for this task, since I need to use it for an ASP .NET application. After some experimenting, I have determined that it is fast and accurate enough for my needs. The suggestion to use Process PrivateMemorySize64 property will also work in general but as pointed out in the answers, for an ASP.NET application there will often be multiple AppDomains running in one process. I need the memory total perAppDomain.p

Negative 2387 pIm using eclipse for java and python. In the pydev package explorer, I have it set to show closed projects, but hide nonpydev projects. The problem Im having is that after I close a pydev project, it is hidden in the pydev package explorer, but not in the java perspective package explorer. If I open it again it disappears from the java perspective and appears again in pydev.p  pIts really a minor issue, and maybe Im just missing something really basic, but is there a way to get python projects to show up only in the pydev perspective, even when they are closedp  pTo reiterate, in the Customize view... menu for the pydev package explorer, I have it set correctly to hide nonpydev projects, but show closed projects. I think it might just not be able to tell if closed projects are associated with python or not.p

Negative 2387 pI think the easiest way to ask this question is with the actual realworld situation Im facing.p  pIn our system, we have a Site model classic MVC framework here that represents a row in our emsiteem table. One of the fields of the emsiteem table that is stored in the Site model is the time zone of the site. We use this to adjust UTC datetimes from the database to the sites time zone on display. There are a few helper methods that aid in this utcDatetimeToSiteTimestamp, utcTimeStampToSiteDatetime, etc.p  pSince these helper methods use the time zone of the site thats held in the Site model, is it okay to include these methods in the model Or should they be placed in a separate helper class or somethingp  pI know models should do more than just hold a row of data from the database, but where is the line between helper methods that act on this data vs. helper methods that use this data to act on external inputp  pThanks for any insightp

Do I have to recompile all the dependencies my project uses, e.g., NHibernate and every single external dependency that comes along p  pNote 1 The reason I asked this question is that I built a project with MonoDevelop on Ubuntu 9.10 and everything went like a charm but when I tried to debug running some tests written with NUnit everything just froze. I have to cancel the running test to get MonoDevelop back up and there is no clear stack trace or hint that I could use to find the problem.

The problem is to detect whether one of their members will share the login credentials with people who would not normally supposed to be accessing the website there is no objection for such a club to have all its members get on the website.p  pI have thought about logging along with each signon the IP address as well as the OS and the browser used if the OSBrowser stays constant and there are no more than, say, 10 different IP addresses, the account is clearly used by very few different computers.p  pBut if there are 50 OSBrowser combination and 150 different IPs, the credentials have obviously been disseminated far, and there would be then cause for action, such as modifying the password. p  pOf course, it is extremely annoying when your password is being unilaterally changed. So, for this problem, I thought about allowing the clubs to manage their own list of subaccounts, and therefore if abuse is suspected, the user responsible would be easily pinneddown, and this submember alone would face the annoyance of a password change.p  pstrongQuestion What potential problems would anyone see with such an approachstrongp

Negative 2387 pI have a very annoying problem.p  pSo I want to include 2 jar files in my java web application .war file  to be loaded on glassfish version 2.1.p  pThe files arep  pcodeaxis2adb1.4.1.jarcode and codewstxasl3.2.4.jarcode.p  pIn my console application, I simply add these to my classpath and they run fine.

So my feeling is that this jar is not loaded some how.p  pI then moved on to repackaging the jars together. I made this big axis2wstx.jar and loaded it into my glassfish project. Same error... It is definately loading since without the axis2 jar it would throw a axis2 class not def exception way earlier.p  pSo my theory is that glassfish is loading the jars lazily and since neither the axis2 jar nor my main program requires this wstx jar, it is not loaded correctly. But I am probably totally wrong.p  pI really hope someone could help me out with this.p
Negative 2387 pI am using TinyMCE in my ASP.net Web Forms CMS application on IIS7 and am having trouble in my content folders that are managed using the URL routing feature of .net 3.5sp1.p  pThe root real default page of the application default.aspx works just fine I have a custom toolbar and many settings defined for TinyMCE and it all works fantastically. My content route contentPageIdentifier which maps to a content.aspx page in the root of the site at the same level as default.aspx doesnt work very well. When the TinyMCE editor is invoked, it is in its default state  my custom toolbar buttons and all of the custom settings e.g. the stuff set in tinyMCE.init are ignored and it just comes up in default mode, as if no parameters were set  toolbar at bottom with few buttons. p  pI was thinking the editor cant find some or all of its js files that are in staticjstinymce since its in a different folder level than what the route says it is since, often if theres a JS error, this is how the editor appears. I tried moving content.aspx to a real content folder, but that did nothing at least relative addressing would work, then. I am at a loss.p

Negative 2387 pI have a problem retrieving some data from the SESSION using php and mysql.  Ive commented out the line in php.ini that tells the server to use the file to store the session info so my database will be used.  I have a class that I use to write the information to the database and its working fine.  When the user passes their credentials the class gets instantiated and the SESSION vars get set, then the user gets redirected to the index page.  The index.php page includes the file where the db session class is, which when instantiated calles sessionstart and the session variables should be in SESSION, but when I do vardumpSESSION there is nothing in the array.  However, when I look at the data in mysql, all the session information is in there.

Negative 2387 pIve made a chain of 4 producerconsumer threads forming a 4 step pipeline. To my amazement, all four threads are running in sequence, instead of concurrently  That is, the second thread mysteriously waits until the first thread is entirely done producing.  The third thread mysteriously waits until the second thread is entirely done producing and so on.p  pIt gets worse.  If I put a Thread.Sleep300 into the loop of the first producer, then the other three threads become concurrent and actually get processor time, as expected, producing random interleaved console output as expected from a multithreaded app.  Im almost unable to accept the idea that a sleep is a necessary part of the solution, and yet I see that a sleep is incorporated in exactly that fashion in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1656404cproducerconsumercode written by Jon Skeeta.  p  pPlease tell me that is not necessary to achieve concurrency, or if it is, then strongwhystrongp  pA more precise story about my particular producerconsumer chain looks like thisp  ol listrongFirst threadstrong in a tight loop it produces widget messages as fast as possible, pushing them into a queue for the next thread.  A System.Threading.Timer is set for 100 milliseconds when the first widget is added to the queue.  The callback fired from the timer is the second thread...li listrongSecond thread fired from timerstrong reads some or all of the widgets from the prior queue.  It sends them into another queue to be consumed by the third thread.  The monitor.PulseWait mechanism is used to synchronize with the third thread.li listrongThird threadstrong Blocks on a monitor.Wait until monitor.Pulse is called, then fetches one item from the queue.  The one item is pushed into the final queue, again using monitor.Pulse when the push is done.li listrongfourth threadstrong Blocks on a monitor.Wait until monitor.Pulse is called.  Widgets are processed.li ol  pTo process 1 million widgets through this pipeline takes about 4 minutes.  In 4 minutes, there is PLENTY of time for the last 3 threads to be scheduled and do some work concurrently with the first thread.

Negative 2387 pIm really struggling with WiX. I have .NET assemblies to install that require registration for COM Interop, AND they must be registered with another framework that requires calling a Register method in a .NET assembly thats in the GAC. This registration method is a black box with a hidden storage mechanism so I cant perform this operation declaratively.p  pI get that the declaritive approach is best for COM registration, but I have two problems with using heat.exep  ol lipRegAsm works, but Heat.exe chokes on my assembly with the messagep  blockquote   pheat.exe  warning HEAT5151  Could   not harvest data from a file that was   expected to be an assembly   C[...].dll.   If this file is not an assembly you   can ignore this warning. Otherwise,   this error detail may be helpful to   diagnose the failure Exception has   been thrown by the t arget of an   invocation.p blockquoteli lipThe secondary registration that I need to do relies on the [ComRegisterFunction] attribute, which normally triggers further actions at the time the assembly is registered for COM Interop. This normally happens when the assembly is registered by RegAsm.exe or by calling System.Runtime.InteropServices.RegistrationServices. So, I need that ComRegisterFunction in my assembly to execute during the installation. pli ol  pI dont mind taking the declarative approach to COM registration or I wouldnt mind if heat worked on my assembly but I need to call that ComRegisterFunction as part of the install. Ideally, Id like to look at all of the executables Im installing, reflect on them for any methods with the [ComRegisterFunction] attribute and call those methods, this would be done after all files are installed.p  pHow can I achieve this in WiX Or, is there another approach If it makes any difference, I am using the Votive Visual Studio integration with project references.p

Negative 2387 pBit of a vague question. Apologies. p  pI have a prototype CMS Ive been working on for fun. Its completely written in ASP.NET MVC.p  pIt works on the principle of widgets. Little blocks of functionality that can be dragged and dropped on the page, you get the idea. p  pI have added a few simple blogging widgets which work well, one of them is the Latest Posts widget that goes on the front page. While the function of the widget i.e. listing the latest posts is standard, the markup it generates may not be. I dont want to force my users into a set in stone markup.p  pI was wondering if it would be possible to use some form of templating perhaps T4 I have not delved into it deeply but it looks fairly complex, so not sure it would even be possible. What I would like is for the enduser to be able to doctor a small template file to change the markup generated for each blog post list item.p  pIf someone knows of any blogstutorials that may get me started Id be very grateful. Googling for custom T4 templates brings up changes to the EditorFor templates that Im sure everyone is familiar with.p  pThanks,p  pIanp

Negative 2387 pIm trying to write some integration tests for my Rails app using Cucumber, with Capybara. The main page of my application, however,d oes not load with any data in it  as soon as the page is loaded, it triggers a javascript that retrieves the data to insert into the pagep  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction    pullUpdates  codepre  pThe pullUpdates function lives in my application.js file.p  pNow, the trick is, if I simply run the application, this works fine. When I run cucumber, it opens the page in Firefox via selenium, but the data never loads. I tried extending the timeout first, so it waits a good thirty seconds now for the data to load  it never does. In fact, Ive gone in and looked at the server log, and my javascript never seems to be even making the ajax call.p  pI found the capybarafirebug gem, next, thinking that perhaps I could just look and see what was happening in javascript on the client side  but it doesnt open firefox when the page opens, so it doesnt catch any of those javascript errors int he first place. I opened the Error console in firefox itself, nad I think htere is errors, but I cannot read them, because they are immediately eaten by seleniums attempts to check if the object its looking for has shown up yet. p  pI imagine this is something simple, stupid, and my fault. But, I dont see how to diagnose it  its not hitting the server, the problem is on the client side somewhere. Can I force Capybara to leave the page open after it errors out, so that I can go back and read the error logs Is there a better way to troubleshoot thisp

Negative 2387 pIm aware that GPUs generally have high memory access times. However, performance isnt greatly hampered as the access time is hidden by executing other instructions whilst waiting for the memory access.p  pI was just wondering, if you have a wavefront with 64 work items, and 16 processor cores, each processor core will have code6416  4code work items. Also, all the cores must execute all the workitems in parallel.p  pSo if the workitem requires a memory access, what happens Surely as all the instructions are the same, you would have 16 memory accesses to compute or just 1. Is it then the case that another one of the 4 workitems on each core is then substituted in to begin execution Does this mean all 16 processor cores are now executing the same new workitem.p

Where do you store the eventsp  pIn my case I have three systemsp  ul liA website, which is a shopli liA backend for the Website to manage customers, products etc.li liAn accounting systemli ul  pWhenever a domain event happens in one of those systems the event is published and can be processed by the other systems. All systems are using event sourcing.p  pI am wondering where you would save the events. Of course each system has to store all events that it processed because it is using event sourcing and therefore depends on the events it once processed. p  pBut what about the other events that where not needed and therefore the system did not subscribe to I am struggling with the fact that requirements can change, such that a system would have to process events from the past that it did not persist. Where would you get these events from, if the system needed to process events that it did not subscribe when they occured p  pI think there is a big difference to systems that do not use event sourcing at this point. If you have to implement a feature in a system A which depends on data, that is not available in A, but in another system B, and you persistent current state via a ORM tool like NHibernate you can simply import that data from A to B. Since a system, that uses event sourcing, depends on events to get to its current state you have to import all the events that you missed in the past but are need now.p  pFor me there are a few different approaches to this problem.p  ol liEach system saves all events that is publishes. This gives you the ability to republish the events if needed or to import them into another system.li liEach system saves all events that happen, even those which do not need to be processed yet. li liAll events from all system are stored in central event log. If you need to proccess a event that happened in the past but you did not subscribe to you can import it from here.li ol  pHow do you handle such a situation Where do you save your eventsp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThanks Roy Dictus for your answer. Im still not sure how to handle the following situationp  pThe website publishes the events CustomerRegistered, CustomerPurchasedProduct and CustomerMarkedProductAsFavorite. In the current version of the backend customers haave to be displayed and their purchases have to be displayed. What a customer marked as a favorite is not of interest in that version of the system. Thus the backend only subscribed to CustomerRegistered and CustomerPurchasedProduct.p  pNow the marketing department also wants the information about the favorite products to be shown on the customer details page. Since the backend didnt subscribe to CustomerMarkedProductAsFavorite this information is not available in the backend. Where do I get that information fromp

Negative 2387 pI am actually using a bad design with two cursors I am aware of it but then the task was simple so I did not bother with the optimization. I am using a query like thisp  precodeDECLARE cursor1 CURSOR FASTFORWARD FOR SELECT DISTINCT name FROM NameMeta  OPEN cursor1  FETCH NEXT FROM cursor1 INTO name  WHILE FETCHSTATUS  0 BEGIN    DECLARE cursor2 CURSOR FASTFORWARD FOR   SELECT DISTINCT place FROM PlaceMeta    OPEN cursor2    FETCH NEXT FROM cursor2 INTO place    WHILE FETCHSTATUS  0   BEGIN    ...   ... ... ... codepre  pUntil I actually clicked on the codeExecutecode button, I was pretty sure that this query is wrong and that it will bail out with an error. From what I see, there are two codeFETCHSTATUScodes being used. So unless it is saving the status of the first codeFETCHSTATUScode somewhere on a stack before opening a new cursor, this query should not work. p  pCan someone tell me how exactly this query works My main question is about having multiple comparison checks with codeFETCHSTATUScode. I manually hand verified some of the results but am not sure if this will fail for a corner case or the query is infact right and SQL Server is doing something else.p

Negative 2387 pThis is the follow up to my question earlier about the Xcode 4 static analyzer.  It is not specifically a problem since I have the code now working as it needs to, but I am just wondering how things are working behind the scenes.  Consider the following codep  precode IBActioncameraButtonPressedidsender      if [UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailableUIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera]  NO              return           UIImagePickerController cameraUI  [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]     cameraUI.sourceType  UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera     cameraUI.allowsEditing  NO     cameraUI.delegate  self     [self presentModalViewControllercameraUI animatedYES]      NSString theString  [[NSString alloc] initWithStringcameraButtonPressed done]     NSLog, theString  codepre  pTo me, the way this code looks, there are two objects cameraUI and theString that need to be released.  However, the analyze function correctly identifies that only theString needs to be released at the end of the method, even though both objects are returned from allocinit, which in my experience has always meant that you release when you are done.p  pThe question I have here is, how does the static code analyzer know not to flag cameraUI as an issuep

Negative 2387 pI am experiencing a strange issue with the zindex of a codeltcanvasgtcode not rendering as the right layer in IE9.  Please take a look at this jsfiddle  p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxactoMTUHXhttpjsfiddle.netxactoMTUHXap  pHeres how it should workp  ul liThe redoutlined box should be hyperlinked and be the top layer.li liThe cyan codeltcanvasgtcode should the next layer.li liThe box with the green background should be on the bottom.li ul  pThis works properly in Chrome, Firefox, and even IE8.  However, in IE9 the cyan codeltcanvasgtcode is the top layer and the redoutlined hyperlinked box is no longer clickable except for the small area at the bottom where it does not overlay the cyan codeltcanvasgtcode.p  pHeres another thing of note  if you change the codeltcanvasgtcode to a codeltdivgtcode i.e. change the linep  precodevar can  ltcanvasgtltcanvasgt.css... codepre  ptop  precodevar can  ltdivgtltdivgt.css... codepre  pIt will work in IE9 as well.

If anyone has an answer to this, it would be greatly appreciated.p  pP.S.  Some may ask why the codeltcanvasgtcode is being added via JavaScript and why it is added as the first element of the codeltbodygtcode.  Without going into details, the 3rd party app which uses the codeltcanvasgtcode requires it to be added that way.p

Negative 2387 pI have been given the task to design and develop a web application for a NGO Non Govt Org which runs primary schools in many towns and villages. The application will keep a record of all the schools, students, volunteers and the teachers of every school. Currently there are about 30 schools in the NGOs umbrella but they have very ambitious plan to increase the number very rapidly. We will host the app on strongWindows Azurestrong using strongSQL Azurestrong as the database. Now I am facing a tough task on how to design its database with minimum expenditure as the NGO is funded completely by charities and donations. As you might know that the databases in SQL Azure is offered in specific sizes like 5,10,20 to 50 GB, it puts a restriction on the maximum size of each database. I have came out with following approachesp  p1 For every school create a separate database of 5 or 10 GB size. Each database will have tables like student,subject,attendance etc. The problem in this approach is that a lot of databases will have to be created. One for every school. This would drastically shoot up the cost. Also initially a large portion of 10 GB size will be underutilized, but in future it may happen that 10GB would seem less for storing a schools data.p  p2 Keep a single database with tables like school,student,attendance etc. This would keep the cost low initially but during course of time the database would start filling up and may reach the max limit of 50GB as more schools are opened by the NGO. Also a single table for student and especially attendance will have huge number of records and would make the queries slow. Even if we add another database in future then how easy would it be to split the tables across several databases.p  pKeeping the limitations in mind we are unable to proceed further. Any approach or suggestion by you will be very helpful for us. Thanks in advance.p  pEDIT Thanks a lot to the people answered my question. i got the point 5O GB is a huge space and it would not get filled any time soon. But that brings me a question Consider a situation when the number of schools grow up to 200, 300 or 1000  Then how should be my database design  I suppose 50 GB would not be big at that situation. p

Negative 2387 pI am trying to understand the principle of information hiding.

Negative 2387 pIve been coding for years and have found myself in a point of frustration. I am working on a new web based service that also has a UI and it will be developed from ground up. It will use some open source components, but is mainly a new thing in its own right.p  pBut heres my problem. Building such a system means building all of those componentsp  ul liPHP backendli liHTML viewsli liCSS stylesli liJavaScript frontendli liAJAX asynchronous connectionsli ul  pI want all of them to follow the same pattern, in a way that a module in the system consists of a folder or set of files that incorporates all of those components within that module.p  pBut I am having a tough time with getting the architecture so that I would like it. Here is what I have so farp  ul liThe entire main system is more or less written in procedural PHP. This solves the request URL, deals with caching, logging and debugging and loads in other components.li liPHP, when building the page, loads in module specific javascript files, CSS files, HTML files and other components based on the current module. This means that every module is as lightweight as possible, while being able to be extended however much based on current modules needs.li liSystem also incorporates OOP components of objects such as users or other type of classes that can be used system wide.li liThe system is built with MVC principles, though without OOP.li ul  pBut I do feel really dirty for having built the main system in a procedural way. I did start writing it in OOP at first, but quickly found myself in headaches due to having to get everything fit the same system. It was OOP, but it was tightly coupled, which I disliked for while it was written the OOP way, components were really not that independent or were just a hassle to manage.p  pAre there any patterns or guides I could follow to get a better result What I like about the current system is that I can call in anything, previewrendering PHP, or HTML views, CSS styling, additional Javascript functions and AJAX communication perdemand, keeping the footpring wonderfully small, but it feels dirty. I even use a global for main database connection though it is a global object.p  pAny ideas It would not be a problem at all if it were just one language, but trying to make everything work together is a bit of a headache.p  pThanksp

Negative 2387 pFirst of all, I have gone through all the questions here regarding the inclusion of jar files for an applet. But even then, I have this Huge Problem.p  pI am developing an application with java and the ApacheTika Library with 4 jars, totaling the size of 40 mbs. The application needs to count the number of words in an uploaded document doc, docx, odf, pdf and a bunch of other. The applet runs pretty well from Netbeans 6.5 or Eclipse IDE which I am using side by side for the development. But when I try to Deploy it to a browser, theres a problem.p  pstrongProblemstrong p  pThe initial page loads pretty good. But as I give the path of the document and Click Ok or Count, I get loads of error messages. Those are all strongClass Not Found Exceptionsstrong related to the external ApacheTika Library. I think I have done all the inclusion of the library correctly as other wise it wouldnt run in the applet viewer. p  pAs for the HTML, I have created a jar of the entire WordCounter Application, along with the library4 ApacheTika Jars and all other necessary files, and included the jar in the  tag accordingly. Do I need to mention anything on the HTML file about the nested jar library, is there a limitation regarding a nested jar  Any Kind of help would be Highly Appreciated.

Negative 2387 pfirst, a little background.  I am using VS2010 and have a WCF service that we publish through VS2010.  I added a new folder to the service to include some android APKs did some setup to get those pushed also through the publish routine.  We have a method that will read the apks, and another that will execute a command in the same folder to extract the version information.  Also, we use impersonation in our service.p  pThe problem we are having right now is if a user that doesnt have rw access to this folder makes a call to our method it will exception because of permissions to the folder.  Setting permissions on the folder manually fixes the issue, but when we publish again the folder may get deleted and recreated.p  pQuestions  How do I setup the publisher to set folder permissions when it is publishingp

Is there a way of doing that p  pI would imagine as a subproblem it would be nice to get access to the information that the debugger has.p  pThe rationale for this is Im interested in only breaking on a certain breakpoint given a certain callstack and at a certain point in the execution of one of those functions in the callstack.  Perhaps I should be using the callstack instead  Another reason is it would be interesting to have programmatic access to the stuff that the debugger knows about.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2387 pIs 205  Reset Content the appropriate response code to return when a partial update has been applied to a resource and the updated resource document isnt returned in the responsep  pUpdated Im creating a web service that will support partial updates to the URL of the resource.  One option is to return a 200 along with an updated resource document.  It seems like another option may be to return 205  Reset Content without a body containing an updated representation indicating that the client should initiate a GET of the resource.  It seems that this would be consistent with returning 201 w a Location header and no body for resource creation which is what Im currently doing for resource creation.p

The code looks something like as followsp  precodevec4 fragcolor fragcolor.rgb  logfragvalue.rgb fragcolor.a  fragvalue.a glFragColor  fragcolor codepre  pwhere fragvalue is derived from a texture lookup. Now, I can set the texture such that the log of codefragvaluecode should give a sensible answer i.e, its in a sensible range to give a fragcolor 0.01.0, but it always renders as black so I assume its just setting it to zero.

Negative 2387 pId like some advice on this issue. Basically, I have 2 pages for simplicity sake, and the second page is completely dependent on the first page.p  pSo lets say the main page is a strongsearchstrong page, and the second page is a strongviewstrong page. p  pThe site works off XML requests, and the ultimate aim is to keep the XML requests to a minimum as each request is a little slow. I considered using Sessions, but Ive had some problems in the past with sessions being mixed between users randomly which i only manage to curb by changing the recycle process in IIS to a very small time frame, so Im wondering if there is any other way. Ive tried TempData, but that expires after one request, so a page refresh on the view page doesnt seem possible. or is itp  pAnyways, we have the Search page that has, say, 5 attributes that are required by the View page, but only 2 are needed to make the XML request on the view page. p  pe.g. p  pstrongSearch Page Containsstrongp  ul liID,li liName,li liCity,li liEmail,li liHeightli ul  pstrongView Page needs the following from the Search page to complete the xml requeststrongp  ul liID,li liName,li liEmailli ul  pView Page displays all the information from the search page, plus everything in the XML response.p  pThe link i have in the search page only has the ID in the url, so name and email are required for the XML request on the second page some how.

Negative 2387 pFor simple objects, its usually easy to have a state attribute thats a string and storeable in a database. For example, imagine a User class. It may be in the states of inactive, unverified, and active. This emcouldem be tracked with two boolean values  active and verified  but it could also use a simple state machine to transition from inactive to unverified to active while storing the current state in that state attribute. Very common, rightp  pHowever, now imagine a class that has several more boolean attributes and, more importantly, could have lots of combinations of those. For example, a Thing that may be broken, missing, deactivated, outdated, etc. Now, tracking state in a single state attribute becomes more difficult. This, I guess, is a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton or State Machine. I dont really want to store states like inactivebroken and activemissingoutdated, etc.p  pThe best Ive come up with is to have both the state attribute and store some sort of superstate  available vs unavailable, in this case  strongandstrong each of the booleans. That way I could have a guardlike method when transitioning.p  pHas anyone else run into this problem and come up with a good solution to tracking statesp

Negative 2387 pGood Morning, p  pI am looking at the feasibility of generating a Desktop Application Crawler. This application crawler would work in a similar way to a web crawler  it would interrogate the application to obtain a UI structure. To fit with other ongoing projects this would be coded in C. p  pThe program would be able to get Window and Control properties and generate a list of which controls are present on which Windows. p  pIs such a thing possible  I assume it is as projects like Microsofts UI Spy do a similar job. The output would be a simple XML format. p  pThanks in Advance,  JHp

Negative 2387 pI have a legacy MFC C application for Win CE 4.2 x86 ONLY which was originally built using Embedded Visual C 4 eVC4.  I need to add some functionality which comes from a C library which uses modern C features which are not supported by eVCs compiler the VS2008 compiler supports them just fine.p  pIve tried opening the solution in VS2008 and receive the error that No platforms are available that match this project files original platforms despite having the SDKs installed correctly this machine also has a functional copy of EVC4 on it.p  pIn my research I see conflicting accounts on the internet of whether or not VS2008 can build with the CE4.2 SDK  but since its all x86 code I dont see why this would be an issue.p  pTo reiterate  I dont need any ARM support, and I dont need emulators or remote debugging.  I just need to be able to build the pile of C files into a DLL which will fly on CE.p  pAnybody been down this path beforep

This class was probably produced by a compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended solution is to recompile the class from source, using an uptodate compiler and without specifying any target type options.

[20120626 172633  TMP] Dx trouble processing javaxxmlwsDispatch.classp  pIlladvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax. when not building a core library.p  pThis is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on.p  pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality.p  pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p  pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem.p  pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor.

Negative 2387 pThe point of concatenation is to improve performance by having just one file to download, but that means that every time you change a bit of your own javascript, the whole package is recompiled and fingerprinted  including large libraries like jQuery that havent changed, and would have been cached if they were downloadable separately, but now jQuery is going to be redownloaded each time as part of your unified application.js.p  pWhat am I missing here  Wouldnt the best approach be to create two manifests  one for your own files which are small and change frequently, and one for libraries which are large and change infrequentlyp

The Kinect SDK samples all work fine, but trying to use them in my own application doesnt seem to, despite my closely mirroring how they initialize the device and the Face Tracker.

Negative 2387 pIm making an application from a TabBarController storyboard template. The tabs are all UINavigationControllers with UITableViews. Each time Tab 2 is entered the tableview should update look for new items to add, but it only loads once First time tab is entered. How to do thisp  pA closer description of my issuep  pWhen Im in Tab 1, I select some cells objects to add to the TableView in Tab 2. Cell tap is changing a boolean for the reprecented object in a plist of objects. p  pSo if I select objects in Tab 1 at launch, and then enter Tab 2, this TableView is filled with the cells because its the first time I enter Tab 2 and it loads. p  pBut if I go back to Tab 1 and select some more objects, these objects are not displayed in Tab 2 because the TableView is already loaded. So how to reload the Tab 2 TableView Should I do this when the selection of tab 2 is happening I have no class or reference for TabBarController, its in storyboard only. Or maybe should I do it in the addObject action in Tab 1 Thank you for answer.p

simple.ampnbsp Every customer will spend more than 34 per pax.ampnbsp If you survey the current hawker scene, you will see Bak Kut Teh stalls springing up all over the place.ampnbsp That is because people expect to pay 56 at least when they eat Bak Kut Teh.ampnbsp So that is going to ensure the survival of Bak Kut Teh as a Hawker dish.ampnbsp Things like Char Kway Teow which can only sell for 3 a plate is less attractive for any aspiring hawker to take on so unless something happens and a Char Kway Teow emerges that people are willing to pay 6 for, then it really is lta hrefhttpieatishootipost.sg201012endofcharkwayteowieatishootipost.htmlgtThe End of Char Kway Teowltagt as we know it.ltbr gt ltbr gt But today we talk about an emerging Hawker dish.ampnbsp I guess Dim Sum is not really what people will consider a traditional Hawker food, but with increasing affluence, stalls which were initially selling only Paus would invariably be attracted to increasing their revenue by offering other Dim Sum dishes.ampnbsp With Dim Sum at the restaurants now averaging around 45 a basket, I see a big opportunity for more hawkers to offer a cheaper alternative in a coffeeshop setting.ltbr gt ltbr gt The other good thing about Dim Sum is that the food can be standardized and prepared in a central kitchen beforehand and steamed fresh at the premises when you order.ampnbsp So that allows for opportunities to expand.ampnbsp At 2 a basket, the average spend for a customer would be at least 810 which essentially triples what you would earn if you sell Char Kway Teowltbr gt ltbr gt With more hawker Dim Sum emerging and restaurant Dim Sum getting ridiculously expensive, I am hoping to see more stalls such as Lai Kee emerging so that we can all spend a lazy morning drinking eating Dim Sum and drinking Teh C without having to pay for peanuts and .ampnbspampnbsp So, if you know of any good hawker Dim Sum stalls, please do write in and let me know so that I can build a list good Dim Sum stalls to visit.ltbr gt ltbr gt lta hrefhttp2.bp.blogspot.comJ6lTLrdcqqwT4ZVRLQgi6IAAAAAAAAR8IWWPwys1W4cs1600DimSumSelection.jpggtltimg

Arial,Helvetica,sansserifgtltemgtVariety of Dim Sumltemgtltspangtltspangtltbr gt ltbr gt The man who started Lai Kee, Ah Lai started off helping to make Dim Sum withampnbsp relatives in Malaysia before coming out to Singapore to start his own stall.ampnbsp His first stall was at Clementi and has now expanded to four branches.ampnbsp He tells me that Dim Sum might be more lucrative but it is a lot of hard work.ampnbsp Now that he has four stalls, he has hired a few Dim Sum chefs to help hand make the Dim Sum every day at the stalls while he prepares the meat, prawn and fish pastes centrally.ltbr gt ltbr gt What I like about Lai Kee is their variety of unusual Dim Sum.ampnbsp The standard fare of Siew Mai and Har Kau are of course available and judging from the Siew Mai, the basic meat filling is very good and well marinated.ampnbsp Ah Lai pays special attention to this and uses only fresh Indonesian pork instead of frozen meat to ensure quality.ampnbsp But he has spent a lot of time thinking up new dishes as well and the wonderful thing about eating there is that you get to try something new instead of the sameo sameo.ltbr gt ltbr gt I was drawn immediately to the Century Egg dumplings because they reminded me of the marvelous breakfast I had at lta hrefhttpieatishootipost.sg201003simsimpier7breakfasttoremember.htmlgtSim Sim Pierltagt in Sandakan.ampnbsp Then there are other permutations and combinations of tasty morsels made from tofu, bean curd skin, meat, prawn and fish filling.ampnbsp I cant say that it tastes as exquisite as the Dim Sum you get at the restaurants, but the affordability, variety and pretty decent food quality certainly makes it a compelling candidate for a quick Dim Sum fix.ltstronggtltspan stylecolor redgt 45ltspangtltstronggtltbr

Negative 2387 pI am having quite an issue regarding the check table query, but only via PDO.  Right now, I have a DBAL that has built in corruption fixing.  It uses MyISAM tables for primary storage purposes, and checks the table for corruption autonomously the first time it is accessed on a particular script.  If its corrupt, it repairs the table, grabs all the IDs remaining, and compares these to the IDs in a backup table SQLite for local deployments, InnoDB for serverside deployments and pushes missing values back in.  This allows our developers to never have to worry about data corruption because the DBAL makes backups and repairsrestores autonomously.  The snag I have ran into is deployment.  For some reasonp  precode    CHECK TABLE pointofcare.zentryvisitanswer MEDIUM codepre  pReturns msgtypestatus, msgtextok as an array even though if I run that exact same query within heidisql, it returns as error rather than okay.

Negative 2387 pIm using MQTT in an android application, using the latest jar as found on the Eclipse Paho page.p  pIm manually checking the connection by sending occasional publishes under a QOS of 1, and if its not delivered under a certain timeout I disconnect MQTT and reconnect. When the data connection is lost then regained I also force a reconnect.p  pThe issue is that the disconnect method hangs the thread and never completes  even with a zero or negative timeout. Its supposed to have an internal timeout of 30 seconds but it goes long past this and never completes.p  pThe MqttClient object needs to be disconnected otherwise it sits in the background chewing up data. What Im now doing is spinning off a seperate thread to disconnect MQTT then creating a new MqttClient entirely.

However, looking at the second two calls only the one using JQuery lookup will work.p  pAm I missing something when it comes to Bootstrap, JQuery or JS in general or is this a Meteor quirkp
Negative 2387 pI have a class that uses a .NET wrapper for a COM object and well it is giving me that infamous RCW error, so in my investigation I found that if I take out the Dispose method from the finalizer of this class it will fix the RCW error so something is wrong for example the object is getting disposed but the registered events are still hanging around ... But just removing the Dispose cant be the answer because then who is going to release the memory   I ran a Memory profiler and confirmed that just removing the Dispose method causes like 20MB of extra Unmanaged Memory p  pso something should be wrong with the way I am using the Dispose model.. here is what I havep  precode  private MyCOMobject theCOMobject  null      static SuppressFieldCntrlr              new SomeCalss           SuppressFieldCntrlr             Disposefalse              private bool disposed  false      public void Dispose              Disposetrue         GC.SuppressFinalizethis           private void Disposebool disposing              if this.disposed                      if disposing                              theCOMobject.Dispose                           MethodFoofalse              disposed  true               codepre

Negative 2387 pI have been pulling out my hair trying to figure out how the MinMax algorithm, and hopefully the alphabeta pruning algorithms work.

Negative 2387 pAssuming the source and target architectures are different, how do emulators efficiently translate memory barriers I know that in general modern emulators will employ a JIT to translate from the source a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInstructionsetarchitectureISAa to the target ISA, but knowing which code is reachable by multiple program counters and which isnt seems pretty tricky, and then knowing which instructions are safe to reorder which maybe required for the JIT to generate something efficient due to ISA differences and which are not seems extremely tricky.p  pYoure not even guaranteed to find an explicit memory barrier in the instruction stream, e.g. many people on x86 rely on aligned word writes to be atomic. Are emulators conservatively assuming that emeveryem aligned word write cant be reordered That seems like a potentially huge overhead, which leads me to wonder if there are any known analyses for tackling this sort of problem.p

Negative 2387 pI know a lot of questions have been asked regarding this topic, but none of them provided an answer for my problem. Thats why Im creating a new question.p  pIve looked on google and here for answers and have found some which have improved my setup of AutoMapper. i.e. only creating your mappings only oncep  pMy problem is that I sometimes get the exception and sometimes I dont. And I have absolutely no idea how to solve it.

Negative 2387 pI could really use some help on this one. I am modifying someone elses code. Bassically what the script does is it Loops through data via coldfusion. The user is suppose to insert data into each of these looped items. Then once completed the javascript box pops up and confirms the data that the user has entered is correct. This works fine... The part I am having trouble with is I need a check box next to each looped form that they click to select which looped form they want to submit. Ive gotten the coldfusion part to work easily..

Whyp  precodehtml, body          height 100         margin 0         containertoolbox                 minheight 100          height100 lt if IE gt         width 100         minwidth100             backgroundcolor99000      codepre  pNow, if I replace the first code with second in a test page, it works perfectly. Why, when there are nested divs within this containertoolbox, does it not work.

Negative 2387 pDRY  Dont Repeat Yourself.p  pI have a base css framework in which I use to build more complex designs.

In this case, I have a model codeSequencecode that represents a sequence of numbers, and a model codePartcode that represent a link in this sequencep  precodeSequence   Sequence   Sequence   Sequence   ... 0          5          20         15         ...  Part  Part  Part  ... codepre  pEach codePartcode thus represents a strongdeltastrong, which is the difference between the two values in the sequence. I have a set of noncontiguous parts and want to calculate the sum of those deltas. Something like thisp  precodesum[p.after.value  p.before.value for p in Part.objects.filter...] codepre  pBut in a single query the reason is that I want to use this as a subquery for a more complex one. Its easy to do it in SQLp  precodeselect suma.value  b.value   from part p     join sequence a on p.afterid  a.id     join sequence b on p.beforeid  b.id   where condition   group by p.otherfield codepre  pI dont know how to do it using Django ORM. I can do it for a single valuep  precodePart.objects.filtercondition.aggregateSumbeforevalue.values codepre  pBut not for an expression involving multiple values. Using codeFcode a hrefhttpscode.djangoproject.comticket14030 relnofollowis not supported yeta, so Im looking for an alternative way. I also looked at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq10221422520779this questiona, which is also about expressions in aggregates, but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma10230338520779the accepted answera using codeextracode is not applicable to my case AFAIK, since the fields Im interested in are not in the same table, but in a related one.p  precodegtgtgt Part.objects.filtercondition.extraselect ...     deltasumaftervalue  beforevalue ...   DatabaseError no such column aftervalue codepre  pHeres a SSCCE, in case anyone want to experiment with it a hrefhttpsmarcelogibson.comstackoverflowaggregatesubquery.zip relnofollowDownloada or a hrefhttpsmarcelogibson.comstackoverflowsscce relnofollowBrowsea. It has the same models and data as the a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com128b39513 relnofollowSQL fiddlea linked above.p
Negative 2387 pI have a model which contains a List and each Schedule has a List inside it, so in my view I havep  precodeforeach Schedule sched in Model.Schedules      Html.DropDownListForx gt x.SelectedCustomer, new SelectListsched.Customers, Id, FirstName, Select A Customer, new  class  SelectedCustomer   codepre  pSo essentially this is outputting a dropdownselect tag for all the schedules, in the dropdown are a list of customers which I have found to the SelectedCustomer field. When I post this back to the HttpPost controller, none of my selections have been bound to my model. However if I was model binding a simple textbox, it works, but anything complex like a List of objects doesnt bind on postback, what is the recommended way in MVC to get back the selected values of all these dropdown boxesp

Negative 2387 pI have been working on a Print Shop website lately. And I am now having trouble in developing an efficient database schema. p  pMy application is a Printshop which offers custom Prints for Posters, Business Cards and Flyers etc.  The problem I am facing is in developing the schema for product options. Here is a scenario  A Business Card can have Size and Material options. The Size can be 3.5x2.5 inches or 3.25x2.25 inches. Similarly Material can be 300 gsm Card Stock or 200 gsm Card Stock.  Now what my store offers is the price for options and quantity combinations . p  pLike,  code100 Business Cards  3.5x2.5 inch  300 gsm Card Stock  500.00code p  por p  pcode200 Business Cards  3.5x2.5 inch  300 gsm Card Stock  800.00code. p  pOne point to be noting here is that the Size option is different for Flyers and Posters products. So a 3.5x2.5 Poster just doesnt make sense. The poster product will have its own sizes. The prices are always bound to the options combinations, there is no individual prices for the products without options combinations.p  pSecondly, there is weight based shipping too. So I would also like to know, where to store the weight in the databasep  pPlease provide some insights about designing such a database. Also I would like an ActiveRecord based approach since I am too weak in EAV Modelling.p

Negative 2387 pI have created a subclass of NSView that allows me to easily change the background color via the method code voidsetBackgroundColorNSColor aBackgroundColorcode.p  pI want my view controllers main view to be this subclass, so I initiate it with codeself.view  [[BetterNSView alloc] initWithFrame...code.p  pOn the next line, I try to set its background color code[self.view setBackgroundColor[NSColor greenColor]]code. But the compiler complains, saying that NSView doesnt have the method codesetBackgroundColorcode.p  pTo solve this, I need to use typecasting code[BetterNSView self.view setBackgroundColor[NSColor greenColor]]code. That works. But Id like to not need the typecasting.p  pHow do I tell the compiler that the codeviewcode property of the view controller is the codeBetterNSViewcode subclass Remember, Im not using IB.p

Negative 2387 pI have an simulation application that I have written both in C and CUDA. To measure the speedup I have recorded the time in both cases. In CUDA, I have used CUDA events to measure the time and then dividing the time of GPU by CPU as usually done. The image of the speedup is provided below. p  pThe weird thing about the speedup graph is that the speedup first increases to 55X and then it decreases to 35X and then again increases as the total number of thread increases. I am not sure why this is happening and how I would be able to figure out the reason behind such an output. I am using a GTX 560ti GPU card with 448 cores. The number of threads for each block is 1024 maximum number and so 1 block at a time for each SM. Is it happening because of the occupancy issues and how could I definitely figure out the reason behind this kind of speedup graphp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comK1Wcp.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxLFxn.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 2387 pI am trying to practice my skills with using latitude and longitude and Im attempting to determine the following given a center point X on a map and a point around it called Y, how do I tell whether or not the points around the center are moving away from the center object or towards it using latitude and longitude p  pRight now I have the center latitude and longitude and am focusing on one of the points around it. I have used the Haversine method to calculate distance in miles between two lats and longs. Using this I measured the initial distance the from X to Y and assigned it to a variable. Upon Ys first move I recalculated the overall distance from X to Y and compared it with the initial. If the new measurement is greater than the old then your distance from the point X is increasing, if not its decreasing. Also, I have check to make sure what Im working with the point Y is ACTUALLY moving some distance with each move, not just going around the radius of point X in some weird fashion. p  pIs the way Im doing things sound alright I keep feeling like I need to fine tune something but I just cant put my finger on it.p  pHopefully everything Im saying makes sense and is not falling on deaf ears and this doesnt get flagged as an nonconstructive question.

Negative 2387 pEDIT  This is about doing Continuous Delivery with Maven and having it orchestrated with Jenkins.  Maven is definitively not designed for that, and this question is part of our effort to get an efficient workflow without using Maven releases.  Help is appreciated.p  hr  pWe use Maven SNAPSHOTs within major versions to ensure customers always get the latest code for that given version, which works well.  For technical reasons we have two independent Maven jobs  one for compiling sources to jars, and one for combining the appropriate jars to a given deployment.  This also works well.p  pWe then have Jenkins orchestrating when to invoke the various steps, and this is where it gets a bit tricky, because if we do the normal codemvn clean installcode in step one, this means that all the snapshot artifacts get recompiled, which in turn makes Jenkins think that all the snapshots emchangedem as their fingerprint  aka MD5 checksum  changed even if the sources used to generate the artifacts did not change, triggering emallem the downstream builds instead of just those which dependencies emdidem change.p  pI have so far identified these things as varying between buildsp  ul liMETAINFmaven...pom.properties as it contains a timestampli liMETAINFMANIFEST.MF  contains JDK and userli litimestamps in jar fileli ul  pI have found ways around the two first, but the latter is a bit more difficult.  It appears that AbstractZipArchiver which does all the work in zipFile and zipDir is not written to allow any kind of extension to how the archive is being generated.p  pFor now I can imagine four approaches but more ideas are very welcomep  ul liCreate a derivative of the current mavenjarplugin implementation allowing for a codetimestampltnumbergtcode attribute which is then used for all entries inserted into the jar file.  If not set, the current behavior is kept.li liRevise the Jenkins fingerprinting scheme so it knows about jar files and only looks at the entries contents, not their metadata.li liAttach a plugin to the codepreparepackagecode stage responsible for codetouchcodeing the files with a specific time stamp.  This requires all files to be present at that time meaning that the jar plugin cannot be allowed to touch the MANIFEST.MF fileli liAttach an extra plugin to the package phase which rewrites the finished jar file, zeroing out all zip entry timestamps in the process. li ul  pAgain, the goal is to make maven SNAPSHOT artifacts fully time independent so given the same source you get an artifact with the same MD5 checksum.  I also believe, however, that this could be beneficial for release builds.p  pHow should I approach thisp

Negative 2387 pIm currently implementing a RESTful API using an MVC framework. I have set up some controllers which allow me to access data on some general collections, for examplep  precodeGET products GET products1 GET users GET users1 codepre  pMy controller is structured so that it has a method for codegetcode, codepostcode, codeputcode, and codedeletecode which match up the the HTTP verb made by the incoming request. Then in the codegetcode function for example I check if the id is present and workout whether to get a single object or an array, like thisp  precodepublic function actionget      id  int thisgtrequestgtparamid     if emptyid               return an array of everything          else                return a specific object       codepre  pThis all works fine. However the next step is to have a relationship to my products or users, so for examplep  precodeGET users1transactions GET users1transactions1 codepre  pNow obviously I could add this into the codeactiongetcode method above but that would make it bloated. So should I create a separate controller for transactions and pass the user id as a parameter with some clever routingp

Negative 2387 pUsing xcode 5 with my upgraded iOS 6 to iOS 7 app, I have run into issues with upgrading third party frameworks and adding third party frameworks which break other seemingly unrelated frameworks. For example, I tried to upgrade the Crittercism framework which was already included in my project and it broke my Stackmob framework with the result that the project build failing because it couldnt find the Stackmob framework even though it was in the same location before the Crittercism upgrade. I had to remove the Stackmob framework first, then upgrade Crittercism, then reinstall the Stackmob framework, then the build succeeded. Another example, is when I tried to install the Parse framework. That broke my PushIOManager framework resulting in the project build failing since it was unable to find the PushIOManager framework even though it was in the same location as before I did the Parse installation. This is after doing clean and builds on the project. This does not seem to be happening with the builtin frameworks when I add them to the project. Whats weird, is that I tried doing all this on an iOS 6 copy of the app using xcode 4.6 and everything worked fine, no issues whatsoever. I was just wondering if anyone else is running into similarly strange issues with their upgraded iOS 7 app and xcode 5. Or if this is just some weird stuff thats unique to my app.p

Negative 2387 pIve been asking myself a very simple C question, but cant seem to find a definitive answer.

Negative 2387 pHello fellow WT users. I have a problem with enabling the user the ability to choose a save location for some data in my application. I have noticed that WT has an absence of an easy to use saveopen file dialog boxes or widgets for the purposes of browsing the hard drive of a machine for a save location or a file to load. I would imagine both of such widgets return the path of said location or file to load, but alas I have not found any. I have also looked at a hrefhttpwww.webtoolkit.euwtdocreferencehtmlclassWt11WFileUpload.html relnofollowWtWFileUpload Classa but had a hard time understanding how exactly to use it, and after googling around some examples determined it is probably not what I am looking for.p  pWhy not use windows OpenFileDialog Well, in this project I have WT overlayed over a full screen application as a UI, if any other windows open the application would minimizewhich is bad. Which is why Im looking to browse the hard drive in just WT.p  pAfter thinking about this for a while, I figured why not just write my own file browser So after a bit of digging I came across the a hrefhttpwww.webtoolkit.euwidgetstreestablesmvctreeviews relnofollowMVC Tree Viewsa. Those look pretty close to a hrefhttpswww.google.comsearchqwindowsopenfiledialogampespv210ampessm122ampsourcelnmsamptbmischampsaXampeiMmiWUuX4BpWosQSfy4CgCQampved0CAkQAUoAQampbiw1137ampbih622essm122ampespv210ampqwindows7savefiledialogampspell1amptbmischampimgdii relnofollowWindows Open File Dialoga, except that I would need to write my own code for building and displaying the trees, browsing the hard drive with boost, then handling all the saving and loading myself.p  pWhich I am not apposed to, it just seemed reasonable to check with the community before I jump the gun and write a lot of code that I potentially might not need to. It seems odd that WT does not have anything to support hard drive browsing, which brings me here.p  pDoes anyone know anything about a Widget, or a clever combination of Widgets, or another WT method to enable the user to browse the hard drive of the machine in just WTp  pThanks in advance for any helpp

My draggable in connected with my sortable and I need to transfer from my draggable container to my sortable container.p  pIn my draggable container I have 2 different items, lets say it is an article and a book and my sortable container is the bookshelf.

Negative 2387 pI have a bit experience in java for android development but I have some questions that is not very clear to me.p  pI have a ViewPager for screen slide, inside my fragment I have buttons that can switch from one screen to another.p  pWhat I did is, in my MainActivity, I declared my ViewPager as codestaticcode, so I was allowed to use the codesetCurrentItemint positioncode from anywhere.p  pBut I learned that declaring a View as static is not a good practice since it would exist forever in the memory as soon as the app is alive. But I though a new approach and I would like to know if it is better or not than using static Views.p  pLets say I have the followingp  precodepublic void MainActivity extends Activity      public static ViewPager pager      code...  codepre  pThen, on my Fragment classp  precodepublic class MyFragment extends Fragment          code...          private void changePageint position             MainActivity.pager.setCurrentItemposition               codepre  pI though to create a class that extends the MainActivity, then I dont need the ViewPager to be static but only public, then I would call this class inside codeMyFragmentcode and change the page. Seep  precodepublic class PageControl extends MainActivity      private void setCurrentPageint position         pager.setCurrentItemposition        codepre  pThen, my codechangePageint positioncode method inside codeMyFragmentcode would bep  precodeprivate void changePageint position     PageControl mPageControl  new PageControl Of course this line would be on onCreate     mPageControl.setCurrentPageposition  codepre  pIm asking this because Im afraid to have a lot of information inside my codePageControlcode class since it is extending the codeMainActivitycode, but this way looks better because I could even create a listener for page changes inside PageControl and easily handle what I want.p  pSo keep my codeViewPagercode as codestaticcode or I should create the codePageControlcode to manage my page changes Any suggestions how I could do this, instead of these options I saidp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2387 pSay my Git repository has the branches codemastercode, codeBranchAcode, codeBranchBcode, and codeBranchCcode.p  pNow all of these branches have been merged into master, possibly multiple times for whatever reason, its a hypothetical scenario.  I want to be able to find all of the merge commits where codeBranchAcode was merged into codemastercode.p  pHere is as far as I got before asking this questionp  precodegit log master BranchA merges oneline codepre  pThis gets me all of the commits that are in codemastercode and not codeBranchAcode that are also merge commits.

And dont just grep for the name BranchA I know that would work in this case, but it is always possible that the merge commit could be given a custom message, so it may not always work.p  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pGood responses so far, but unfortunately, I have hit a wall that I dont know how to get past.

By looking at the graph, I can see that I am looking for codeLcode and codeDcode.  The curve ball that is keeping me from figuring this out programmatically however, is the merge commit codeIcode where master is merged into BranchA.p  pIn this scenario, if we use the codebranch containscode method on all commits in master, we get codeLcode,codeDcode,and codeBcode. However, if we do branch contains on all commits in master and not in BranchA, we get only codeLcode.  Neither approach gets the desired output.p  pSimilarly, if we use codegit mergebasecode to find the parent, we get only codeLcode.p  pAs far as I can tell, there does not seem to be a good way to separate codeBcode and codeDcode, since both commits are in the history of BranchA.  I can tell by looking at them that they are different, but Git does not seem to have a good way to distinguish them.p

Negative 2387 pSimilar to the SpriteKit Featured Game Adventure from WWDC, I am try to load my background image via tiles. I have created a Texture Atlas that contains 6,300 tiles that are each 100x100 pixels in size. The complete background image is a total of 30,000x2048 for retina displays. The idea is that the background will move from right to left sidescroller. The first column and the last column match so that they seem continuous.p  pWhen the application runs, it loads my initial loading screen and title images and spikes to strong54MBstrong in my memory tab with a CPU usage of strong16strong. This stays the same as I navigate through the menus until I choose my level, which tells a background thread to load the level assets of which contains the aforementioned background image. The entire .atlas folder shows to be only strong35.4MBstrong. I dont believe that this is a problem since the Adventure .atlas folder from WWDC shows to be only strong32.7MBstrong.p  pOnce I select the level, it loads approximately 20 of the textures in the .atlas folder before I start receiving memory warnings and it crashes the application. Ive checked in Instruments for leaks and it doesnt show any memory leaks. I dont receive any compiler errors not even the EXCBADACCESS one. Ive looked at my device console and have found a few lines of where the application crashes, but it doesnt look to make much sense to me. Ive also checked for Zombies, but havent seemed to find any.p  pstrongCoreLevel.mstrongp  precodedispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYHIGH, 0,       Used to determine time spent to load     NSDate startDate  [NSDate date]       Atlas to load     SKTextureAtlas tileAtlas  [SKTextureAtlas atlasNamedDay]       Make sure the array is empty, before storing the tiles     sBackgroundTiles  nil     sBackgroundTiles  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity6300]       For each row 21 Totals Rows     for int y  0 y lt 21 y            For each Column 100 Total Columns         for int x  1 x lt 100 x                Get the tile number 0  32  0             int tileNumber  y  300  x               Create a SpriteNode of that tile             SKSpriteNode tileNode  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithTexture[tileAtlas               textureNamed[NSString stringWithFormattiled.png, tileNumber]]]               Position the SpriteNode             CGPoint position  CGPointMakex  100, y  100             tileNode.position  position               At layer             tileNode.zPosition  1.0f             tileNode.blendMode  SKBlendModeReplace               Add to array             [NSMutableArray sBackgroundTiles addObjecttileNode]                   NSLogLoaded all world tiles in f seconds, [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDatestartDate]  codepre  pThis is what seems to pertain to the crash from the Debug consolep  precodecom.apple.debugserver300.2[9438] ltWarninggt 1 0.000000 sec [24de1807] error read  1, 0x4069ec, 18446744069414585344  gt 1 err  Bad file descriptor 0x00000009 com.apple.debugserver300.2[9438] ltWarninggt Exiting. com.apple.launchd[1] UIKitApplicationtv.thebasement.CoinVoyage[0x641d][9441] ltNoticegt     UIKitApplicationtv.thebasement.CoinVoyage[0x641d] Exited Killed 9 codepre  pI dont have enough reputation to post images so here is a link to a screenshot screenshot of my allocations in Instrumentsp  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimagej17xl39et relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimagej17xl39etap  pAny help and advice is much appreciated If Ive left out some pertinent information, Im glad to update.p

Negative 2387 pI am having problems with Foundation and the Accordion and Tabs modules. I created my project using the command line codecompass create ltproject namegt r zurbfoundation using foundationcode and I then customized the style sheet using Sass and the codesettings.scsscode. Although, I cant get the Accordion and Tabs modules working and I dont understand why. I realized that both codefoundation.accordion.jscode and codefoundation.tab.jscode files do not come with, in the JS folder when creating a project like I did. I therefore decided to put them myself there from a standard downloading of Foundation but it is still not working. I obviously included the script tags for them at the end my Html page.p  pDo you guys know if theres any possibility to create a Foundation project using Sass that includes those two modules I cant use the standard Foundation since I am like customizing everything. p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 2387 pHi im working on Oracle stored procedure in which im subtracting two dates and is returning Timespan like 00 hhmmss.ff format now i want to access only HHMMSS format either in the stored proc or in asp.net application. When i try to return timespan as it is that is the result which i get after subtraction i cannot find a way to read it as it is not Date time. I want to disply time span in HHMMSS format either from data base side or from front end side. I tried using following methods.p  precode 1TODATE TOCHARMAXCOMPLETEDDATEMAXREQUESTDATE24,YYYYMONDD HH24MISS,YYYYMONDD HH24MISS  codepre  pso that later i can extract hhmmss from this later but this is throwing error p  precode 2  TOCHARMAXS.COMPLETEDDATEMAXS.REQUESTDATE24 codepre  pIt is returning time in 00 hhmmss.ff format and i cant extract hhMMSS from this p
Negative 2387 pI have a chunk of memory populated by external code which Im trying to reverse engineer. I dont know the complete structure of this memory, but I do know a few fields e.g. the chunk starts off with an int32 named foo and theres a double at offset 0xC called bar. I want to define a structure and essentially reinterpretcast a pointer to this memory chunk to that structure, and have it line up. Im not sure if theres a more conventional name for this technique but Ill refer to it as creating an overlay type.p  pHeres a sketch of what Id like to be able to dop  precodeSTARTOVERLAYTYPEmytype, 0xFF  struct named mytype, size 0xFF     FIELD0x00, int32t foo      field int32t foo at 0x00     FIELD0x0C, double bar       field double bar at 0x0C ENDOVERLAYTYPE codepre  pNot having to use macros would be a plus, but I dont see a good way around them.p  pWith my current implementation, I expand this to something likep  precodepragmapackpush, 1 templateltsizet pgt struct paddingt  unsigned char pad[p]  templateltgt struct paddingtlt0gt  struct mytype      union              struct  paddingtlt0xFFgt   ensure total size is 0xFF         struct  paddingtlt0x00gt  int32t foo   field at 0x00         struct  paddingtlt0x0Cgt  double bar   field at 0x0C       pragmapackpop codepre  pThis compiles and works great, at least in the versions I tried of clang, gcc, and VC with appropriate changes to the pragma. Unfortunately, warnings abound due to the nonstandard use of anonymous structs.p  pIs there any way to achieve the same effect while staying within the standard The requirements are that it be reasonably simple to declare like the current macro is, and that to the consumer, the usage is indistinguishable fromp  precodestruct mytype  int32t foo double bar  codepre  pat least to the casual observer.p  pThe current code will work for my purposes, Im just curious if there is a better approach I am overlooking.p

Negative 2387 pUntil today, I have been using the macports version of codepython27code and installing python packages through macports.  Today, I needed some packages which were not available through macports I learned about pip and found them there.  After installing these packages through pip, however, I realized that neither pip nor macports could see what had been installed by the other.  So, for consistency, I decided to uninstall all macports packages, install codepython27code and codepy27pipcode through macports and then proceed to install all of my python packages through pip. p  pThis worked fine, but since macports does not know about my pipinstalled python packages, I ran into trouble when installing something else which depends on python e.g., inkscape macports tried to install its own version of, e.g. codepy27numpycode already installed by pip and then failed installation because it already exists and does not belong to a registered port.p  pIs there a consistent way to use pip and to get macports to recognize that the python packages it might need for something else are already installedp

Negative 2387 pI have a WCF service, that is using Entity Framework to connect to a database. I came across some kind of a strange behavior  when I start debugging the WCF service and invoke one of its methods Operation Contracts, I get two different scenarios depending on the way I debug. Meaning, when I just invoke the method, without stepping into the code, I get an exception, stating Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint PKTagIsUsedInPublication. Cannot insert duplicate key in object dbo.TagIsUsedInPublication. The duplicate key value is 16, 54. On the other hand, when I put a breakpoint at the beginning of the method and step into the code and go through it line by line, everything works fine. How is this possible and what am I doing wrongp  pMy method uses two of the entities from the database  Publication and Tag. I also have a bridge table, called TagIsUsedInPublication. It has two foreign keys  one pointing to the Publication table, and another  to the Tag one. It has a compound primary key, consisting of the two columns the foreign key ones. Of course, this means Publication and Tag have manytomany relationship.p  pHere is my methodp  precodepublic static bool EditPublicationInterpretum.InterpretumService.SimplePublication publication      try              InterpretumDAL.InterpretumEntities interpretumEntities  new InterpretumDAL.InterpretumEntities          InterpretumDAL.Publication publicationDbContext              from p in interpretumEntities.Publications              where p.Id  publication.Id              select p.SingleOrDefault           This method just gets all the properties of my custom SimplePublication class and maps them to the Publication entity.         publicationDbContext  publication.ToDbContextpublicationDbContext          if publication.Tags.Count  0                      publicationDbContext.Tags  Tag.RenderTagListpublication.Tags, publication.CreationUserId, interpretumEntities                   interpretumEntities.SaveChanges          catch Exception e               I added this throw line just to see what actually is causing the method fail.          throw e         return false           return true  codepre  pThe RenderTagList method is necessary because my schema requires uniqe values for the Name column of the Tag table. So, it is checking whether theres already a tag with the name provided. If there is, it is added to the list of Tags. If it isnt, a new one is created and only then it is added to the list.p  pHeres what this method looks likep  precodepublic static ListltInterpretumDAL.Taggt RenderTagListListltSimpleTaggt simpleTags, int creationUserId, InterpretumDAL.InterpretumEntities interpretumEntities      ListltInterpretumDAL.Taggt tags  new ListltInterpretumDAL.Taggt      foreach var simpleTag in simpleTags              InterpretumDAL.Tag tag  interpretumEntities.Tags.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.Name  simpleTag.Name          if tag  null                      tag  new InterpretumDAL.Tag                              Name  simpleTag.Name,                 CreationUserId  creationUserId                                tags.Addtag           return tags  codepre  pAs I wrote above, when I just invoke the EditPublication, an exception is thrown. Of course, I invoke it with the same values every time and no matter how many times I invoke it, I always get this exception. However, when I step into the code and step over the method line by line, everything works fine.p  pI have to mention that I am fairly new to Entity Framework, so it is quite possible that I am doing something wrong. The problem is that I cant see what I am doing wrong, just because of this unpredictable behavior.p  pstrongEdit 1strongp  pStack tracep  precodeat System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.OnErrorSqlException exception, Boolean breakConnection, Action1 wrapCloseInAction at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlInternalConnection.OnErrorSqlException exception, Boolean breakConnection, Action1 wrapCloseInAction at System.Data.SqlClient.TdsParser.ThrowExceptionAndWarningTdsParserStateObject stateObj, Boolean callerHasConnectionLock, Boolean asyncClose at System.Data.SqlClient.TdsParser.TryRunRunBehavior runBehavior, SqlCommand cmdHandler, SqlDataReader dataStream, BulkCopySimpleResultSet bulkCopyHandler, TdsParserStateObject stateObj, Booleanamp dataReady at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.FinishExecuteReaderSqlDataReader ds, RunBehavior runBehavior, String resetOptionsString at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.RunExecuteReaderTdsCommandBehavior cmdBehavior, RunBehavior runBehavior, Boolean returnStream, Boolean async, Int32 timeout, Taskamp task, Boolean asyncWrite, SqlDataReader ds at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.RunExecuteReaderCommandBehavior cmdBehavior, RunBehavior runBehavior, Boolean returnStream, String method, TaskCompletionSource1 completion, Int32 timeout, Taskamp task, Boolean asyncWrite at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.InternalExecuteNonQueryTaskCompletionSource1 completion, String methodName, Boolean sendToPipe, Int32 timeout, Boolean asyncWrite at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery at System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.Interception.DbCommandDispatcher.ltNonQuerygtb0DbCommand t, DbCommandInterceptionContext1 c at System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.Interception.InternalDispatcher1.Dispatch[TTarget,TInterceptionContext,TResult]TTarget target, Func3 operation, TInterceptionContext interceptionContext, Action3 executing, Action3 executed at System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.Interception.DbCommandDispatcher.NonQueryDbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext interceptionContext at System.Data.Entity.Internal.InterceptableDbCommand.ExecuteNonQuery at System.Data.Entity.Core.Mapping.Update.Internal.DynamicUpdateCommand.ExecuteDictionary2 identifierValues, List1 generatedValues at System.Data.Entity.Core.Mapping.Update.Internal.UpdateTranslator.Update codepre

Negative 2387 pI was wondering what this function actually performs. To my understanding it should return pSrc[1].p  pSo why does it bother leftshifting pSrc[0] by 8 bits, which zeroes out those 8 bits.

Negative 2387 pThe following code fails to compile because the compiler complains about codecharcode being incompatible with codeconst char constcode in the call to codePrintStringscode. If I declare the codestrscode variable as codeconst charcode, then the call to codePrintStringscode works, but the codememcpycode and codefreecode calls then complain that they are getting const types. Is there anyway around this issue Note that I dont want to cast codestrscode to the incompatbiele type codeconst char constcode in the call to codePrintStringscode, because Im using very aggressive compiler optimizations that rely on never breaking aliasing rules.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt  void PrintStringsconst char const strs      int x  0     whilestrs[x]         printfs, strs[x]   int mainvoid      int x  0       If I make this const char then the memcpys and frees will fail,       but if I leave the const off then the call to PrintString fails       char strs  malloc5  sizeofchar      strs[0]  malloc128     memcpystrs[0], Hello, 1  strlenHello      strs[1]  malloc128     memcpystrs[1],  , 1  strlen       strs[2]  malloc128     memcpystrs[2], World, 1  strlenWorld      strs[3]  malloc128     memcpystrs[3], n, 1  strlenn      strs[4]  NULL      PrintStringsstrs      whilestrs[x]         freestrs[x]     freestrs      return 0  codepre  p[EDIT]p  pPlease remove the duplicate marker from this question. I fully understand why the cast is invalid, and unlike the other poster thats not what Im asking about.

Negative 2387 pIm trying to figure out how to determine the best balance in structuring a database.  I want to be able to store the information from several different forms submitted by different people, sometimes multiple times such as a yearly update.  Im stuck between having a different table for each form, or a combination of form and element definition and element value tables.p  pExample A There are three types of form with different information, so there are four tables, [FormA], [FormB], and [FormC] that each have the data associated with their respective forms, all FKed to [Customers].p  pExample B Same three forms, but this time there are five different tables.  [FormDescriptions] defines the form names, types, etc and has three entries, one for each form.  [Forms] FKs to [Customers] and [FormDescriptions] and uses these in combination with the submission date to distinguish individual submissions. [FormElements] defines all the elements from the three forms, with a FK on FormDescriptions and a unique elementID.  [ElementValues] FKs to [FormElements] and [Forms] and stores the value of the selected element on the selected form.p  pMy question is, is one of these methods inherently better than the other, and if not, in which situations is each better than the other  As much why or why not that you want to include is appreciated.p

Negative 2387 pI am reading emCode Complete 2em and I ran across this statement in Error Handlingp  blockquote   pCall an errorprocessing routineobject. Another approach is to   centralize error handling in a global errorhandling routine or   errorhandling object. The advantage of this approach is that   errorprocessing responsibility can be centralized, which can make   debugging easier. The tradeoff is that the whole program will know   about this central capability and will be coupled to it. If you ever   want to reuse any of the code from the system in another system,   youll have to drag the errorhandling machinery along with the code   you reuse.p blockquote  pAnd later it saysp  blockquote   pThis approach has an important security implication. If your code has   encountered a buffer overrun, its possible that an attacker has   compromised the address of the handler routine or object. Thus, once a   buffer overrun has occurred while an application is running, it is no   longer safe to use this approach.p blockquote  pBut I couldnt really understand the statement above. How can a buffer overrun cause a address compromisingp

Negative 2387 pI have a scrollview whos only content is a segmentedcontrol, I have DelaysContentTouches turned on for the scrollview, but on my iPhone6 running IOS 8 it appears to often be ignoring the fact I am scrolling not touching and passing the touches along to the segemented controller.  IE it is registering the segments being touched as I slide over them instead of the scrollview recognizing it as a slide.p  pI dont seem to see this issue on an iPad Air running the code in IOS 7, and my IOS 7 iPhone 5 also seems to be able to distinguish between scrolls and touches just finep  pOn the IOS 8 device its almost like the thing just gets stuck in passing through touches to the content sometimes and doesnt want to recognize a scrollswipe at all... Its doesnt make the device non functional, and EVENTUALLY it figures out you are trying to scroll, after multiple swipe attempts where it just passes the touches through to the content incorrectly.p  pAs long as the scroll bar is visible it seems to properly recognize any swipe is a scroll, but once the scroll bar disappears and you attempt to scroll again, is when it seems to pass through the touch, rather than recognizing it is a scroll.p  pIs this a known bug in IOS8  Are other folks noticing this  Is there a work around  Or do I have a faulty device that is somehow, not properly handling swipes I am hard pressed that it is a device issue as the segment touches, when being passed through coincide exactly with where my finger is at all times, so I dont think its sometimes loosing the touch and then registering my slide as a completely new touch.  I truly thing the DelayContentTouches is faulty in this case.p  pI only have horizontal scrolling turned on for the scrollview in question, if that matters at all.p

Negative 2387 pI have a singlepage app that is leaking fairly substantially.  I am trying to track down the memory leaks using Chromes builtin memory profiling tools.  The heap snapshot has been giving me a lot of success in tracking down quite a few problematic code blocks, but I have now reached a bit of a deadend.p  pI have taken a heap snapshot and isolated a variable that has clearly leaked.  I then open it up the retainers view so that I can see why the object has not been garbage collected.  What I am now seeing in the retainers view see below is confusing me.  It keeps reaching a deadend even though it claims that the given node in the graph still has a distance of 11.  Im not sure why it wont let me dig into the object when it says that there is still depth there.

Negative 2387 pIve written a service in C. p  pIt runs fine on Windows as a service. And I can also get it to run once on Raspberry pi using the commandp  precodemonoservice MyService.exe codepre  pHowever, I would like to control the service  i.e. run it as a daemon.p  pCurrently the only way I know how to stop the service is to use the ps command to get the mono process id number  and then it using kill 9  to kill the process.p  pHowever doing so has the unfortunate conseqence that I am unable to start the service again And, so far the only way Ive managed to get it to start again is to first reboot. p  pI understand that the right way to go about this is to start the service like this insteadp  precodemonoservice lrootMyService.lock MyService.exe codepre  pWith lMyService.lock creating a file holding the process id of the MyService.exe service so that I can kill that pid rather than the pid for mono.p  pHowever, when I do this the service does not start at all and no Myservice.Lock file is created.

Negative 2387 pI have a app which connects to a heart rate strap. It is calculating bits on heart rate and logging it to a file and sending it with Json to a web server. When the app is in the foreground it displays the heart rate, speed and some extra info to the user.p  pNow when the app enters the background it stops the calculation and doesnt send data to the web server and also stops logging to the file.p  pNow the question is, what is the right way to make this app. I have now a datahandler class which handle and log the data, it is sharedInstance and it sends data to the view with postNotificationName... .p

Negative 2387 pI am trying to run a benchmark on Mac with  OS version 10.9.5, 2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, and 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory. The workload reads in sections of a large file that was mmapped into the address space. I am interested in how performance is affected if the amount of buffer cache available to my process is limited. My colleague and I were not aware of straightforward ways of doing this i.e. a direct system call, etc, so we created a memory hog program that runs in the background and constantly touches every page allocated to it, to force the kernel to allocate a certain chunk of physical memory to the hogger. Our basic problem is that we found the benchmark to run significantly faster with the hogger running in the background, and we did not know how to interpret that result.p  pThe basic gist of the memhog code is there is a bit of error checking in our actual codep  precodemem  mallocsize  Allocate size bytes for int i  0  i  i  PAGESIZE  size    Infinite loop     mem[i]  codepre  pThis program was compiled with gcc with no optimizations enabled. By adding print statements into the loop, we verified that every iteration of the loop except the first one, due to all the page faults that must occur the first time we touch the memory happens quickly, which suggests that about size bytes of physical memory is actually held by this process.p  pThe oddness occurs when we tried running our benchmark while running the memory hog. Without  running the memory hog, the benchmark runs in about 16 seconds. When we do run the memory hog in the background, however, the benchmark speeds up significantly Namely, we found that when we are hogging 1 MB of memory basically hogging almost nothing at all, but just having a useless process spin in the background, the benchmark finishes in about 13 seconds consistently. Hogging more memory  4 GB, it takes 1415 seconds to finish, and hogging 6 GB, the benchmark takes roughly 16 seconds to finish. The benchmark itself takes about 4.3 GB of memory as measured by getrusage by subtracting values for rumaxrss before loading in all data and after loading in all data. p  pWe found this to be very puzzling while performance might not deteriorate with memhog in the background, it is odd that performance could improve by so much when a useless process is spinning in the background. Do you have any insights into this behavior Thanksp  pWe also have vmstat data that we can post if it helps with the question we didnt included it now as it was rather long.p

Negative 2387 pThis is a very confusing issue so I will do my best to elaborate.

I then use the info in the row to populate an email that I send to the customer for their order confirmation.pli ol  pMy big issue is that for some reason step 2 is getting finished before step 1 so when I try to look up the payment id in the database, it doesnt exist yet so I cant send the email to the customer.

Negative 2387 pI have a perhaps odd problem. I am connecting report builder to the report server of a cloud based management information system and drawing data from their data model. This works totally fine, however I wish to include some information which is not in that database. I have the data in Excel sheets and an SQL server that just sits on my machine.

Googling the issue tends to insist theres a connectivity problem between Report Builder and my Data Sources, but thats not the case since they work fine Is Report Builder taking on the point of view of the Report Server when I connect to it If so, is there a way around this problemp  pThanks Danp
Negative 2387 pI make an app via Phonegap which is working fine.

Negative 2387 pIm currently reading up on the Microsoft Unity Application Block in order to use it in one of my personal project.

Ill have some classes that do need property or field initialization in the constructor. My question is, how would I achieve that Or is that something Unity cant do by itself I would have to create the object using Unitys codeResolvecode function that would give me an object with uninitialized fieldsproperties, and then I would have to call the setter one by one on each fieldspropertiesp

It seems to me that if the page takes less than half a second or so to load, its fine, but if it takes more than that BrowserSync stops it and reloads the current page.br  This explains why disabling the proxy partly fixed it, since with the proxy pages always took around 20s to load.p  pI have tried this in normal Firefox 34, and in a fairly clean install of Firefox Dev Edition 36, with almost no extensions installed.

Negative 2387 pI am currently working on a project, building a web application using C, MSSQL and Angular.  I have implemented file upload via drag and drop, and also multiple file upload, also via drag and drop.  When the files are dropped, I use angular to send an API request to the server to save the file.  I post the files to the server one by one. p  pNow, each user has only a limited amount of storage that he can use, the amount that he has already used is saved in the database. p  pNow what happens. The user drag and drops 45 files at once. The size you get from summing the file sizes of these files is larger than the amount of memory the user has the right to use. p  pHowever, all of the files are saved, because they pass the check one by one, and one by one are saved to the database... what I have is a race issue. If the check for the second file is, by chance, performed after the first file is saved, it will not pass e.g.. If not, then the check will pass, and the user will exceed the amount of storage that was given to him.p  pDo you have any advice on how to fix the issue p  pI hope everything is clear, I dont think putting code would be of much help. p  pThank you all in advance.  p

To return results in a different sort order, use the   geoWithin operator and the sort method.p blockquote  pThe only thing I didnt see in the docs is how to include the distance in the results.  p

Negative 2387 pSo heres my problem... I have a WKWebView loading a page in iOS. If the user navigates to another page in the WKWebView, I can get the URL they clicked as follows p  precodevar clickedUrl  String  func webViewwebView WKWebView, didFinishNavigation navigation WKNavigation       clickedUrl  webView.URL.absoluteString as String  GETS URL OF CURRENT PAGE LOADED  codepre  pIf the user goes to YouTube, clickedUrl  a hrefhttpwww.youtube.com relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.coma, which is great. HOWEVER... If the user then clicks on a video  nothing. And another video  nothing. I do not get the URL of the clicked video. The same happens on Vimeo and various other sites. p  pI have done some research on here and found other posts, and it would seem this has something to do with WKWebView does not report finish of loading on non main frames, but no explanation of how to get at the URL that has been loaded. I am guessing that this has something to do with sites like YouTube are using JavaScript to navigate to other pages on their site and load them.p  pI have also tried codewebViewdecidePolicyForNavigationActioncode. This function is more verbose, but this function also does not detect the URL of links clicked within sites like YouTube. What I want to do is get the URL of everything the user clicks. I am guessing I need to go deep into NSURL or NSURLRequest to get this, but I cannot work out how to do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

If button is pressed, a codengclasscode assigns a class to a DOM element.p  pThe class itself puts a negative codemargincode on this elements. This works perfectly fine on all browsers. What happens on Safari is, that is quickly jumps on the actual state and then assigns the new class to the element which causes the codemargincode and there fore the jump back.

Negative 2387 pThis wont come up too often, but its really puzzling, and if anyone could suggest a remedy, Id appreciate it.p  pI have 2 Google maps on a page showing different locations.  They are initiated separately using nearly identical code geocoding and mapcanvas ids are of course different.  When I put these next to each other on the page, theres no problem. Everything works.p  pBut Id like to use a CSS3 3D transformation for a card flip effect. Opening the page shows 1 map within a div. Clicking a button on the page initiates the transformation and the div flips over, revealing the second map. When I do this, the controls on the second mapthe zoom, street view, panning, etc.dont work. When you hover over this second map, the cursor does not change to a hand or pointer. Everythings frozen. On the first map, though, these controls remain operational, both when the page is first opened and after flipping back to it.p  pThis problem occurs in Safari, Chrome, and Opera. In addition, in Safari the zoom buttons and streetview guy disappear a second after the map is initialized. But in Firefox, all controls on both maps work fine.p  pI tried delaying the initialization of the 2nd map till after the flip had occurred.

Negative 2387 pI am currently preselling a monthly subscription service, which will not launch until the 1st June 2015, however I cannot find a way to delay initial payment until 1st June using Paypal Subscription Button. I dont want to charge people two weeks early, as this would result in them being charged early each month. Likewise, I dont want to add a two week trial period, because Ill have to alter the length of the trial each day, as I sign up new people closer to launching the service. Is there anyway to qualify the payment method, without actually taking the payment through Paypal until a specific date, i.e. 1st Junep
Negative 2387 pIve just discovered that you can make custom forms in Outlook 2013. Now, we currently use two calendar apps, one which is very specific to our business needs and the other is Outlook 2013 Office365. We currently sync some events, but not all, since the extra events dont have any place in Outlook as theyd be missing a tonne of relevant data, or it just wouldnt be readable.p  pIs it possible to embed this data in the content of a custom form, then read this using VBScriptsome other method If we could do this, then it would make the readability of the bespoke events in our business calendar a lot easier. I cannot find anything on this online probably because I dont know exactly what to search for. I do not need the outlook version to update the business calendar.p  pFor example, data might look like thisp  pcodeprimaryGroup01XUAAL,eventNameCustomer Request 192codep

Negative 2387 pI tried to look for something like this but so far nothing. I plan to make my own if its not available just want to make sure I am not reinventing the wheel here.p  pI basically just want to use bower for frontend dependencies, and npm for task based dependencies, so most likely codegruntcode or codegulpcode. I want a task that can basically combine all the bower dependencies into one file with source map if possible, but given its multiple libraries not sure how well that will work.p  pIs there anything like this available The reason for it is I really like how composer creates an autoload file so you can require it and forget it, its available in your application.p  pSo lets say for example you have bootstrap and jquery as dependencies, you have jquery first in your bower file and bootstrap second. All you need to do is codetask updatecode and it creates a combined file of all your bower components in the order they are required.p  pBTW I do know of browserify but this is a little different.p

Right now Im trying to pull the values from Request.Form but with a CheckboxList its hard to figure out what has been selected.p  pEdit New example that should actually runp  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeFileQuestionExample.aspx.cs InheritsQuestionExample gt  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt lthead runatservergt     lttitlegtlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt                 lttablegt         ltaspListView runatserver IDLV OnItemEditingLVOnItemEditing OnItemUpdatingLVOnItemUpdatinggt             ltLayoutTemplategt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtltaspPlaceHolder runatserver IDitemPlaceHoldergtltaspPlaceHoldergtlttdgt                     lttrgt                    ltLayoutTemplategt             ltItemTemplategt                 ltaspLinkButton IDEditButton runatserver CommandNameEdit TextEditgt                 ID ltaspLabel runatserver IDlblLeadID Textlt LeadContainer.DataItem.LeadID gt gt Name lt LeadContainer.DataItem.Name gtltbrgt                             ltItemTemplategt             ltEditItemTemplategt                 ltaspLinkButton IDUpdateButton runatserver CommandNameUpdate TextUpdate gt                 ID ltaspLabel runatserver IDlblLeadID Textlt LeadContainer.DataItem.LeadID gt gt ltaspLabel runatservergtNameltaspLabelgt                 ltaspTextBox runatserver idtbName Textlt LeadContainer.DataItem.Name gtgtltaspTextBoxgt                 ltaspPanel runatserver idpnlQuestionsgtltaspPanelgt             ltEditItemTemplategt         ltaspListViewgt          lttablegt     ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThen the code behindp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Web.UI using System.Web.UI.WebControls  public partial class QuestionExample  Page      region fake data      protected ListltQuestiongt Questions  new ListltQuestiongt              new Question  QuestionID  0, QuestionType  QuestionType.Textbox, QuestionText  TextBox, Options  null ,         new Question  QuestionID  1, QuestionType  QuestionType.DropDownList, QuestionText  DDL, Options  new Listltstringgt  A, B, C ,           protected ListltLeadgt Leads  new ListltLeadgt              new Lead  LeadID  0, Name  Bob, Answers  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt   TextBox, Hi ,  DDL, B   ,         new Lead  LeadID  1, Name  Fred, Answers  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt   TextBox, Stuff ,  DDL, C   ,           endregion          protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              LV.DataSource  Leads         LV.DataBind           protected void LVOnItemEditingobject sender, ListViewEditEventArgs e              LV.EditIndex  e.NewEditIndex         LV.DataBind         var leadLabel  LabelLV.Items[e.NewEditIndex].FindControllblLeadID         var leadID  int.ParseleadLabel.Text         var panel  PanelLV.Items[e.NewEditIndex].FindControlpnlQuestions         var lead  Leads.Firstl gt l.LeadID  leadID         foreach var answer in lead.Answers                      var question  Questions.Firstq gt q.QuestionText  answer.Key             panel.Controls.AddCreatQuestionControlquestion, lead, true                    protected Control CreatQuestionControlQuestion question, Lead lead, bool setAnswers              Control result  null         switch question.QuestionType                      case QuestionType.Textbox                 var tb  new TextBox                 if setAnswers                                      var answer  lead.Answers[question.QuestionText]                     tb.Text  answer                                  result  tb                 break             case QuestionType.DropDownList                 var ddl  new DropDownList  DataSource  question.Options                  ddl.DataBind                 if setAnswers                                      var answer  lead.Answers[question.QuestionText]                     ddl.SelectedValue  answer                                  result  ddl                 break                   return result           protected void LVOnItemUpdatingobject sender, ListViewUpdateEventArgs e               Get input data here somehow          LV.EditIndex  1        public class Lead      public int LeadID  get set      public string Name  get set      public Dictionaryltstring, stringgt Answers  get set    public class Question      public int QuestionID  get set      public string QuestionText  get set      public QuestionType QuestionType  get set      public Listltstringgt Options  get set    public enum QuestionType      Textbox  0,     DropDownList  1,  codepre

Negative 2387 pimplemented a solution to a problem in arithmetic precision handeling in gmp  but the results are rather strange . as a part of troubleshooting I was wondering whether there is any other package hich woudl allow similar operatiosn as gmp in R. I would need something like chooseZ and multiplication of numbers larger than 264  jsu to make sure that I am not having an error somewhere in this step of my scriptp  pneed to compute nubers like p  pchoose2450,765 then multiply it with a floating point number like 0.0034 p  pthe log solution is not really working becasue the expression can aslo be p  psum for 2 to k of k kchoose1800,8000.089p  pso Iw ould need a wauy to sum over k emkemchoose1800,8000.089p
Negative 2387 pI have a data frame called family 1 below. This data will be used for constructing dendrograms and for principle component analysis. I would like to control the names of items in both dist and promp objects, which use row names to indicate the relation between items i.e., dissimilarity matrix. I have created an array of different dendrograms by systematically naming the rows code below. However, my family names are are alpha numeric X22, X2, X75, and X87, and are different on every row, thus R seems to get confused by them. The data frame will be very large and systematically naming rows will be exhaustive. Each row in the data frame may be labelled and ordered with a different a family name i.e., X22, X87, X22, X4, X22.....,.  In the below example I organised the family names using ddply.  The question I am asking is how to rename the rownames in this large dataset with their correct corresponding family name contained under the column heading Family.  Then I can extract the column Family from the data frame and just rely on the rows names to indicate dissimilarity relations between families for their values of SBI.x, when using dist and promp.p

Negative 2387 pI am creating a feature where a user can record a video of themselves, and superimposed on this video is a view that displays an image and some text. When they are done recording, I am using AVFoundations composition classes to composite the video and the view as an image into one video file, and output this in the next scene in a custom video player. The problem is that while the views resolution is crystal clear in the record scene, after the composition and after the AVExportSession completes the resulting videos overlayed view quality is not clsoe to the actual view quality. I am converting the view to an image, and then setting the contents of an overlay layer as this images CGImage, which, as I have checked, still has the same quality as the original view. The problem occurs when I apply the composition, and the image becomes blurry. Does anyone have any idea why this might be happeningp  pIf you need to see the code, please feel free to ask I can also provide screenshots.p  pThank youp

Some services are called directly in code, and some are called via jQuery using a proxy file to return JSON to the client.p  pIn the case of a web forms application I have a file named Proxy.aspx which contains in its code a series of codewebmethodscode which fetch data from the Web Service, like thisp  precodePublic Class SamProxy     Inherits System.Web.UI.Page     ltWebMethodTrue, XmlIncludeGetTypeiSAMapi.SamAPI.Customergt      Public Shared Function doLogin  parameters   As iSAMapi.SamAPI.Customer          Dim SAMService As New SamAPI.samThinkkaAPISoapClient         Dim outputData As iSAMapi.SamAPI.Customer  SAMService.doLogin  parameters            Return outputData     End Function End Class codepre  pI am working on a project using MVCRazor and am recreating this Proxy file as an codeApiControllercode, the corresponding function from above looking like thisp  precodePublic Class ApiInterfaceController     Inherits ApiController     ltSystem.Web.Http.HttpPostgt      Public Function doLoginltFromBodygt ByVal Data As DictionaryOf String, String As iSAMapi.SamAPI.Customer         Dim SAMService As New iSAMapi.SamAPI.samThinkkaAPISoapClient         Dim outputData As iSAMapi.SamAPI.Customer  SAMService.doLogin  Parameters                  Return outputData     End Function End Class codepre  pTo explain the setup behind this, I have my ASMX Web Service registered as a Web Reference in Visual Studio, thus codeDim SAMService As New iSAMapi.SamAPI.samThinkkaAPISoapClientcode in each bit of code is referencing the service classes created by this.p  pWhen I call these functions with jQuery, in both cases I get a successful post and response, but in the codeApiControllercode all the properties of the codeCustomercode object being returned have the word codeFieldcode appended to their name.p  pThe codeCustomercode object, in brief looks like thisp  precodePublic Class Customer     Property Id As Integer  0     Property Name As String       Property Email As String       Property EmailVerified As Boolean  False     Property Address As String        more properties  End Class codepre  pFrom the web forms post I get an object just like that which I can use directly as JSON, but from the other I get codeIdcode as codeIdFieldcode etc.p  pSo, Ive spent quite a lot of today Googling for this and ended up with a lot of reference to codeXmlSerializerFormatAttributecode, but I am not sure which way round many of the articles I find are referring to this issue, however, I have found the followingp  ul liIf I decorate the codewebmethodcode on the web service host with codeXmlSerializerFormatAttributecode as  codeltWebMethod, ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttributegtcode it makes no differenceli liIf I decorate the codeCustomercode class on the web service host similarly, it make no difference.li ul  pHowever, p  ul lipIf I can make it work by editing the codereference.vbcode file which is created by Visual Studio when updatingadding the service reference as followsp  precodeltSystem.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttributeSystem.Xml, 4.0.30319.34234,   System.SerializableAttribute,   System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute,   System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttributecode,    System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeAttribute[Namespace]httplocalhost50184gt  Partial Public Class Customer      Customer Properties  End Class codepreli ul  pChanging this top  precode    ltSystem.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttributeSystem.Xml, 4.0.30319.34234,       System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute,       System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute,       System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttributecode,        System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeAttribute[Namespace]httplocalhost50184gt      Partial Public Class Customer          Customer Properties      End Class codepre  pSo.. how do I get Visual Studio to create this Proxy codereference.vbcode to use codeSystem.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttributecode instead of codeSystem.SerializableAttributecodep

Negative 2387 pPursuant to a simple, intrusively referencecounted object system, I have a codetemplatelttypename Tgt class Handlecode, which is meant to be instantiated with a subclass of codeCountedBasecode. codeHandleltTgtcode holds a pointer to a codeTcode, and its destructor calls codeDecRefcode defined in codeCountedBasecode on that pointer.p  pNormally, this would cause problems when trying to limit header dependencies by using forward declarationsp  precodeinclude Handle.h  class Foo  forward declaration  struct MyStruct      HandleltFoogt foo  This is okay, but...   void Bar      MyStruct ms     ...theres an error here, as the implicit MyStruct calls      HandleltFoogtHandle, which wants Foo to be a complete      type so it can call FooDecRef. To solve this, I have      to include the definition of Foo. codepre  pAs a solution, I rewrote codeHandleltTgtHandlecode as followsp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt HandleltTgtHandle      reinterpretcastltCountedBasegtmptrgtDecRef  codepre  pNote that Im using codereinterpretcastcode here instead of codestaticcastcode, since codereinterpretcastcode doesnt require the definition of codeTcode to be complete. Of course, it also wont perform pointer adjustment for me... but as long as Im careful with layouts codeTcode must have codeCountedBasecode as its leftmost ancestor, must not inherit from it virtually, and on a couple of unusual platforms, some extra vtable magic is necessary, its safe.p  pWhat would be emreallyem nice, though, would be if I could get that extra layer of codestaticcastcode safety where possible. In practice, the definition of codeTcode is emusuallyem complete at the point where codeHandleHandlecode is instantiated, making it a perfect moment to doublecheck that codeTcode actually inherits from codeCountedBasecode. If its incomplete, theres not much I can do... but if its complete, a sanity check would be good.p  pWhich brings us, finally, to my question  strongIs there any way to do a compiletime check that codeTcode inherits from codeCountedBasecode which will not cause a spurious error when codeTcode is not completestrongp  p[Usual disclaimer Im aware that there are potentially unsafe andor UB aspects to the use of incomplete types in this way. Nevertheless, after a great deal of crossplatform testing and profiling, Ive determined that this is the most practical approach given certain unique aspects of my use case. Im interested in the compiletime checking question, not a general code review.]p

Negative 2387 pI have some classes under a Rails application codeApplicationNamecode. They are autoloaded as part of Rails on the boot of my application server. Some are codeActiveRecordcode models, some are PORO models, and some are service classes, which are also POROs. Some of these classes have the same name, but are under different namespaces such as codeUsercode and codeNameSpacedUsercode, which represent different objects with similar concepts.p  pIn one of the namespaced classes, I do some ETL work to get a foreign object to meld into an codeActiveRecordcode model in my database. Since the codeActiveRecordcode model by default is under the global codeApplicationNamecode namespace, I figured codeApplicationNameModelNamecode would work, and I expected it to return the top level object the codeActiveRecordcode model. Instead, I got an unintialized constant error. codeApplicationNameApplicationModelNamecode returns it, but I get a warning about the class referencing the toplevel namespace as I expected, considering that codeActiveRecordcode object resides up there. The codeModelNamecode model conflicts with another model under a different namespace for the sake of argument well call it codeDifferentNameSpacecode. Things look likep  precodemodule ApplicationName   class Application lt RailsApplication     do autoload stuff here   end end  class ModelName end  module DifferentNameSpace   class ModelName   end end codepre  pIs there any way to specifically call codeApplicationNameModelNamecode or to do an codeApplicationNameApplicationModelNamecode without the warning Right now it works if I do codeModelNamecode, but that looks ugly.p

and set it to the  ImageView,but have no clue on how to make it stay when the activity   is closed or destroyed. I need the same functionality for each   alarm as they will have different images in ImageView.

Negative 2387 pI am currently working towards implementing a charting library with a database that contains a large amount of data. For the table I am using, the raw data is spread out across 148 columns of data, with over 1000 rows. As I have only created  models for tables that contain a few columns, I am unsure how to go about implementing a model for this particular table. My usual method of creating a model and using the Entity Framework to connect it to a database doesnt seem practical, as implementing 148 properties for each column does not seem like an efficient method.p  pMy questions are p  pWhat would be a good method to implement this table into an MVC project so that there are read actions that allow one to pull the data from the table p  pHow would one structure a model so that one could read 148 columns of data from it without having to declare 148 propertiesp  pIs the Entity Framework an efficient way of achieving this goalp

However, I wasnt able to solve my problem following the comments in that thread.p  pIm trying to measure the coverage of a concrete test case in a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectskmymoney2filesKMyMoneyKDE44.6.4 relnofollowKMyMoney4.6.4a, namely testConstructor in the test file mymoneyaccounttest.cpp. This test case is using the following method, which is in the header file mymoneyaccount.h and has executable codep  precode const QStringamp institutionIdvoid const      return minstitution    codepre  pSo, I build the program and the tests, and then execute gcov mymoneyaccount.cppp  pAmong the coverage information displayed, I obtainp  p...

Moreover, it shows 6 in the line of the class declaration, so this file has coverage information but not what I was expecting.p  pI have to say that maybe the problem has to do with the names of the files and the directoriesp  p1 The object files are created in CMakefileskmmmymoney.dir ending with .cpp.o, for instance, mymoneyaccount.cpp.o. Thus, the gcno and gcda files are created with the name mymoneyaccount.cpp.gcno and mymoneyaccount.cpp.gcda of course, in the directory CMakefileskmmmymoney.dir.p  p2 When I execute gcov o CMakeFileskmmmymoney.dir mymoneyaccount.cpp gcov gives the following errorp  pmymoneyaccount.gcnocannot open notes filep  pSo I have to rename those files mv mymoneyaccount.cpp.gcno mymoneyaccount.gcno mv mymoneyaccount.cpp.gcda mymoneyaccount.gcdap  pFinally, I have another question. When I execute gcov in the file containing the test cases, I mean, gcov mymoneyaccounttest.cpp instead of gcov mymoneyaccount.cpp, I also obtain a mymoneyaccount.h.gcov file, but the coverage information is even worsep  precode   81class KMMMYMONEYEXPORT MyMoneyAccount  public MyMoneyObject, public MyMoneyKeyValueContainer codepre  pAnyway, the question is should I execute gcov on the implementation file mymoneyaccount.cpp or in the test file mymoneyaccounttest.cppp  pSorry for the length.
