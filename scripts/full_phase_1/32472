Positive 32472 pI have a CMFC app that I am trying to make more portable in preparation for crossplatform conversion to something like wxWidgets.p  pMy first step was to identify all of its compiler and linker dependences, such as the CRT library, Windows SDK, and MFC, and collect these together in the same filestore as the project, so that the whole package would be independent of any particular working environment WinSDK version, etc that might vary from one computer to another.p  pFor compiler dependencies, this was relatively easy.  By using the X optionp  blockquote   pProject  Properties  CC  Preprocessor  Ignore Standard Include Pathp blockquote  pI was able to detach the project from the default include folders defined inp  blockquote   pTools  Options  Projects and Solutions  VC Directoriesp blockquote  pThis of course generated a slew of compilation errors, and by transferring all of these required libraries to my filestore and adding their new paths manually to the p  blockquote   pProject  Properties  CC  General  Additional Include Directoriesp blockquote  pI was able to ensure that I had my own copy of everything the compiler depends on for my project.p  pHowever, for the linker it was not so easy.  While it does have the optionp  blockquote   pProject  Properties  Linker  General  Additional Library Directoriesp blockquote  pfor adding the custom dependencies, I could not find a way to get the linker to ignore the standard library paths to help me identify these dependencies.p  pAll I could find was p  blockquote   pProject  Properties  Linker  Input  Ignore All Default Librariesp blockquote  pbut this is not the same thing at all.  It just causes the linker to ignore the pragmas in the headers that specify which library emfilesem should be linked to, but leaves the standard library paths available for the linker to search.p  pIn the end, I had to go back to p  blockquote   pTools  Options  Projects and Solutions  VC Directoriesp blockquote  pand delete all of the Library files directories to ensure I was not inadvertently overlooking a dependency.  This of course now makes VS2008 unable to build other projects, where I am not trying to achieve the same type of dependency isolation.p  pIt seems odd that the compiler has this useful override switch X for disabling standard environment paths, but the linker does not.p  pCan anyone shed light on this  Or am I missing somethingp

Far from perfect, and no doubt will have some subtle internal issues to fight with soon.p  pIm now trying to figure out codestdtostringcode, which cannot be adapted to the boost version so easily theres also probably more issues in other classes Ive not encountered yet.p  pAs far as I can see, I have twoish optionsp  p1 Bite the bullet and preprocessor separate all backwardscompatibility code. This will uglify and bulk the code for something that isnt going to be used 99 of the time  but will be significantly quicker to implement.p  p2 Derive from stdstring, and add the missing functionality as required. Repeat for other classesfunctions. This will require using unknown classes to people unfamiliar with the project, as well as additional time coding to fill in these gaps, with potential for bugs, but be the cleanest solution. It could also be used for future compatibility fixes too.p  pSwapping out every type isnt a big task, but Id like to keep raw implementation types wherever possible, especially as the code needs to run on Linux and BSDs too. Im not doing anything crazy that would be hard to backport either no tuples, lambdas, or other things thatd be problematic in this context.p  pHas anyone had to do something similar before and found a nice solutionp

Negative 32472 pIn fairly large Ruby application, we have a situation where a given object is identified by a couple of things name and id, say. Each of these value types serves a somewhat different purpose and so are not exactly equivalent id and name persist in different places. So we windup with a variety of values being passed around the application ids, names and objects. This situation seems like a problem to at least some degree since weve already been bitten by bugs which involved not being clear what type should be passed to a given function. I actually recall seeing similar problem code in a number of applications over the years, though I again never gave a specific name to it. p  pRuby, as a typeless language, does not allow classical typebased polymorphic functions in the way that C does. As a work around, a colleague has often resorted code of this sortp  precode  def initialize startingvalue     if startingpost.kindof Foo       startingid  getidfromfoo startingvalue     elsif startingpost.kindof Bar       startingid  getidfrombar startingvalue     else       raise illegal type     end   end codepre  pThe proliferation of this code around our codebase not just initializers results in what I would call messypolymorphism. It often works but sometimes creates very puzzling situations. p  pI have three questions about this. p  ul liIs there a formal name for this as an antipattern Messy Interface, Messy Polymorphism or something elseli liHow bad to do people think this is li liIs there a systematic way to refactor this The challenge that we have with ordinary refactoring that many tests were created use this  loosetyping and thus we would have to change both the tests and the implementations simultaneously and so wouldnt have the scaffold effect of ordinary testbased refactoring. I am think that one could actually strengthen this loose polymorphism,  and abstractout the code into a function rather than immediate rip it out. But would  this be a good ideali ul

Negative 32472 pIm using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd419663.aspxRelayCommanda in my app. Its great for putting the code in the viewmodel, but how do I bind keystrokes to my commandp  pRoutedUICommand has its InputGestures property, which makes the command automatically be invoked when I press the keystroke. As an added bonus, it even makes the keystroke display in the MenuItem. Unfortunately, theres no reusable interface for RoutedUICommands extra properties, so I cant make a RelayUICommand that gets the same magic.p  pIve already tried using InputBindingsp  precodeltWindow.InputBindingsgt     ltKeyBinding KeyPageUp CommandBinding SelectPreviousLayerCommandgt ltWindow.InputBindingsgt codepre  pBut that gets me a runtime exception, because KeyBinding.Command isnt a dependency property. Actually, what it complains about is that KeyBinding isnt even a DependencyObject. And since my RelayCommand is a property on my ViewModel as opposed to the static field that RoutedUICommand is designed for, databinding is the only way I know of to reference it from XAML.p  pHow have you guys solved this Whats the best way to bind a keystroke to a RelayCommandp

Negative 32472 pemUpdateemp  pPutting this at the top because it is crazy p  pSo some users have it work, some dont.  When I use my own account via IE7 it doesnt work my code catches the exception and falls back to simply using the identity name instead of the AD fullname.  When I try via Chrome it prompts me for the username and password, which I supply, and the fullname is displayed.  So the user account, server code and settings are identical, but using a different browser to send the authentication is making it work.p  pI also cleared all cookies from IE7, restarted, and there was no change in IEs behavior.  Plenty of users of IE7 are having it work fine.p  pemUpdate 2emp  pRemotely logged into a different machine, went to the page in IE7, and it shows my full name.  No clue.  I was thinking maybe session was caching something but Ive republished the app and that should clear session.  I was thinking maybe a cookie had an old  bad token, but Ive cleared those and tried again.  Something somewhere has to be getting long term caching.

Negative 32472 pHow do I track and manage the dependencies of software modules under version control  p  pI am building several websites, each of which uses a particular Apache configuration, particular Django code, a shared Python library, and some shared Javascript.  For each site these pieces are interdependent  if the server code changes, the Javascript might change with it, or viceversa.  p  pI could put the whole thing under one project, but this seems unwieldy.  But if I put them under separate projects, then I have to track the elements dependencies by version.  DjangoStuff v. 14 works with JavascriptStuff v.20, but not v.21.  JavaScriptStuff v.21 works with DjangoStuff v.15.  p  pWhat is the best approach here  Im using Subversion.

Negative 32472 pI need to write a server that will receive instructions from other modules and take actions depending on the instructions received. Efficiency is my main concern.

Negative 32472 pI know, type checking function arguments is generally frowned upon in Python, but I think Ive come up with a situation where it makes sense to do so. p  pIn my project I have an Abstract Base Class codeCoordcode, with a subclass codeVectorcode, which has more features like rotation, changing magnitude, etc. Lists and tuples of numbers will also return True for codeisinstancex, Coord.code I also have many functions and methods that accept these Coord types as arguments.

Its just there to illustrate the point. And it would be used likep  precodeacceptsnumbers.Number, numbers.Number def addx, y     return x  y codepre  pNote Im only checking argument types against Abstract Base Classes.p  pIs this a good idea Is there a better way to do it without having to repeat similar code in every methodp  pstrongEditstrongp  pWhat if I were to do the same thing, but instead of checking the types beforehand in the decorator, I catch the exceptions in the decoratorp  precodeclass acceptsobject     def initself, types         self.types  types      def callself, func         def wrapperargs              try                 return funcargs             except TypeError                 raise TypeError, message             except AttributeError                 raise AttributeError, message          return wrapper codepre  pIs that any betterp

Negative 32472 pI dont know what could be causing this issue, but for some reason, elements on my page list navigation items, specifically, are disappearing in IE6. That is, from IE developer toolbar, I can see that the elements are there, and the DOMcss is correct, but the elements just arent visible.p  pThe odd thing is that if you set or toggle ANY css element on the list items with the IE6 toolbar, the elements appear. I also have a codehovercode jQuery action set on the list navigation items, and the event fires as if the elements were visible and working correctly.p  pWhat could possibly be going wrong here I initially thought zindex could be an issue, but changing ANY attribute or css value not necessarily zindex, causes the element to render. I should note, however, that doing this programmatically does emnotem cause the elements to display properly, even if triggered seconds after the page load.p

Negative 32472 pUsing DJ Native Swing it is possible to show a web page within a java application.

Although when I create and image, script tag or just and ajax get request there is no response and the breakpoint in the java runtime isnt triggered.p  pI dont want to set the window.location because I dont want to navigate away from the page I am currently at.

Negative 32472 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4205574pauseformsubmissionforvalidationPause form submission for validationa  p blockquote    pIts a continuation of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4205574pauseformsubmissionforvalidationthisa post. So basically Im uploading a file in an iframe. But before submitting, I grab data from the form and using djangos builtin system check their validity currently its just a dummy function that takes foo bar, and returns json result  true . I use two buttons  fake visible, that calls validation and second  hidden, that submits the form. With the code below Im able to perform validation, then when its result is positive form is submitted. Now if I hardcode target for form, my alert is not shown and Im pretty sure that the upload is not performed unfortunately list of uploads is refreshed each 8h so Ill know if it worked in some time. If the target is not specified, file is uploaded with redirect so the whole submit event listener is omitted. What more, tho whole code doesnt work at all in Chrome. And it takes like 23s looking at firebug between receiving response from validation, and displaying it which Ive never seen before. Im really desperate on making it work, since Ive already wasted 2 days and without any results.p  pSample linkp  pa hrefhttpntt.vipserv.orgartifact relnofollowhttpntt.vipserv.orgartifactap  pJSp  precodeltscriptgt       fakeuploadsubmit.clickfunctione         e.preventDefault          var fileUploadForm  document.getElementByIdfileuploadform         fileUploadForm.addEventListenersubmit, function              alertsent in iframe             fileUploadForm.target  uploadtarget         , false                 .ajax             type POST,             url artifactuploadcheckform,             data foobar,             dataType json,             success functiondata                 ifdata[result]  true                     message.show                     message.fadeIn400.htmlltspangtdata[message]ltspangt                     setTimeoutfunction                         message.fadeOutslow, function                               message.hide                                              , 1500                      fileUploadForm.submit                                   else                     message.show                     message.fadeIn400.htmlltspangtResponse falseltspangt                     setTimeoutfunction                         message.fadeOutslow, function                               message.hide                                              , 1500                                         return false                                                return false                 ltscriptgt codepre  phtmlp  precodeltdiv idmessage stylebackgroundblack width400px height80px displaynone colorwhitegt ltdivgt lth1gtSubmitlth1gt ltform actionuploadurl methodPOST target idfileuploadform enctypemultipartformdatagt      renderuploaddata uploaddata      lttablegt form lttablegt         ltpgt         ltinput typehidden maxlength64 namemyfileid value myfileid  gt     ltpgt     ltpgt         ltinput typesubmit styledisplaynone idtrueuploadsubmit valueSubmit gt     ltpgt         ltiframe iduploadtarget nameuploadtarget src stylewidth0height0border0px solid fffgtltiframegt ltformgt     ltpgt         ltinput typesubmit idfakeuploadsubmit valueSubmit gt     ltpgt codepre  hr  pEDITp  pIEs debugger shows codeObject doesnt support this property or methodcode forp  precode    fileUploadForm.addEventListenersubmit, function          alertsent in iframe         fileUploadForm.target  uploadtarget     , false codepre  pbecause of using addEventListener, but no more errors.

The warning still shows up.p  pSo again, in desperation, I commented out all the lines causing warnings. But the warnings still show up. I even restarted XCode and even rebooted the machine, but no progress. Each time i test this i am cleaning and rebuilding.p  pIs this an XCode 4.0.2 bug or am i totally missing some new XCode 4.0 concept herep  pstrong Updated strongp  pIt appears this was a user error on my part. I have 2 build targets. All the warnings were coming from the nonselected Target. Once I selected the proper target and cleanbuilt again, all warnings disappeared.  RESOLVED.p

Negative 32472 pI am about to tackle my first Mac OSX project after developing for iOS. In my iOS applications, it is clear to me the whole NavigationViewControllerMyViewControllerMyViews paradigm.p  pA bit more background on the iOS app so it would be easier to understand me The application is some sort of graphic viewer. Once you login you have a list of drawings, and if you select one, it opens it up.  Now in the iOS app I have a custom UIViewController that have some menu UI and a UIScrollView that holds a UIView in which I draw the drawing. The custom UIViewController is responsible for acting as the application where the UIView inside is merely a graphic context.p  pNow  back to Mac I was thinking that my main window would show the drawings and once one is selected, I would add another window with an NSView that is the graphic context of the drawing, and the window will be acting as the UIViewController in the iOS app.p  pDoes that make sensep

Negative 32472 pIve found one of the code on Stackoverflow and I thought it is pretty similar to what I am facing but I still dont understand why this would enter a deadlock. The example given wasp  precodeClass A    synchronized void methodAB b        b.last        synchronized void last        System.out.println Inside A.last      Class B    synchronized void methodBA a        a.last       synchronized void last        System.out.println Inside B.last           Class Deadlock implements Runnable     A a  new A    B b  new B     Constructor   Deadlock        Thread t  new Threadthis      t.start     a.methodAb       public void run        b.methodBa       public static void mainString args[]         new Deadlock     codepre  pIn this case, when the Deadlock constructor is called, it starts itself as a thread. When it does this, the run method is invoked. It will call b.methodBa, which then call a.last to just print out a statement. At the same time, a.methodAb would call b.last. There is no cross dependencies on any object and they are not executing a method at a same time too. Even if they are, the synchronized keyword would queue them, wouldnt it But how come this would occasionally enter a deadlock too It is not all the time but it would sometimes enter a deadlock, which is quite unpredictable. What is it that causes this to go into a deadlock and workaroundsp  pThanks.p  pemPS The code was taken from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions217113deadlockinjavaDeadlock in Javaaemp

Negative 32472 pI have noticed on the Motorola xoom, that the applications icons on the Launcher are 72px by 72px. This is normally the size of icons defined in drawablehdpi in packages.p  pIn my application I want to display the icons of some installed applications on that 72x72px size. I currently fetch the icons of installed apps via the PackageManager, but it returns me bitmaps of inferior size 46px, which corresponds to the resources defined in drawablemdpi of each package. This is not acceptable for me as I would like to display these icons in a larger format.p  pApparently the 10 screen of the Motorola xoom is 160dpi, thus mdpi and xlarge see a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.htmlrange relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.htmlrangea.  This would explain the behaviour of PackageManager returning me mdpi resouces instead of hdpi resources.p  pHow could I get the icons of installed applications in a size of 72x72px minimum Does anyone knows how it was done in the Launcher application on Android Honeycombp  pThanks,  Laurentp

Its crazy, but thats how they designed it. Its taking an absurd amount of time to process and if the data were indexed, it would still be slow, but it would 100xs less slow.p

Negative 32472 pI have a table in a database with one column containing dates and another one containing scores.

My function works for every day of that week except for 20100829 Sunday since it tries to find the next day that is a Sunday itself in this case. To compensate for that, I go back 7 days to get the correct Sunday, which creates the error for the already correct Sunday since this one doesnt need to go back 7 days or else it is one week off.p  pI figured I could solve this problem easily using Java, but I want to see how it should be done using SQL instead.p  pMy solution I dont even know if it can be done, would be to check if date and dateStartOfWeek are the same. If they are, dont substract 7 days from the date. If theyre not, do as I did in my example. I dont know how to use conditions such as this one in SQL, though, and this is where I need help.p  pThanks a lot in advancep

Everything was fine until I tried to add a new JPanel to my application, at that point i found out that I cant add this codeJPanelcode to any of these classes, because none of them is a codeJFramecode instance , so the questions raised, what are FrameView and SingleFrameApplication anyway are they standard Swing JComponents is it appropriate to ask questions like codeJPanel Vs FrameViewcode Or it is nonsense Would you please enlighten me and future googlers p

I used .htaccess to get rid of the .php file extension.p  pSo one of my URLs would look like this  stronghttpwww.domain.comaboutstrongp  pWhen I got a static version of the website, it changed all of my links to .htmlp  pThat could be fine, as I could use htaccess to get rid of that file extension and so all of my links will be the same as before.  Well, all of the internal linking in each page is linking to the .html version.p  pstrongIs there a way with htaccess to direct users if they go to about.html it will take them to about with no extension  So all of my internal linking will still workstrongp  pOr is there any other suggestions you guys might have on how to handle thisp  pHere is the wget code I usep  precodewget k K  E r l 10 p N F nH httpwww.domain.com codepre  pHow can I get that to output .php files instead of .htmlp  pThanksp

Negative 32472 pI have an iPad app IOS 4.3 amp 5.0 that is creating a UIView with at least 2 subviews every time the user pages forward or backward.

Negative 32472 pIts well known that using forward declarations is preferable to using includes in header files, but whats the best way to manage forward declarationsp  pFor a while, I was manually adding to each header file the forward declarations that were needed by that header file.  However, I ended up with a bunch of header files repeating the same halfdozen or so forward declarations, which seems redundant, and maintaining these repeated lists got to be a bit tedious.p  pForward declarations of typedefs e.g., codestruct SensorRecordId typedef stdvectorltSensorRecordIdgt SensorRecordIdListcode is also a bit much to duplicate across multiple header files.p  pSo then I made a codeProjectForwards.hcode file that contains all of my forward declarations and included that wherever it was needed.  At first, this seemed like a good idea  much less redundancy, and much easier maintenance of typedefs.  But now, as a result of using codeProjectForwards.hcode so heavily, whenever I add a new class to it, I have to rebuild the world, which slows development.p  pSo whats the best way to manage forward declarations  Should I bite the bullet and repeat individual forward declarations across multiple subsystems  Continue with the codeProjectForwards.hcode approach  Try to split codeProjectForwards.hcode into several codeSubsystemForwards.hcode files  Some other solution Im overlookingp

Negative 32472 pI wonder if there is an equivalent of c union in Javascript I need to use it as a library I use for an Html5 game wants some fixed variable names for the object I pass to a function of this library however it is much easier for me to keep the data in an array for easier calculation.

The parameter must have variable names a, b, ... f which correspond to matrix elementsm[0][0], m[0][1] ... consecutively. I have my own matrix class for calculations in which I use an array. I know that entering the parameter on the fly, as shown below, sorts out my problem however I dont want to do that every time I call the function nor I want to write a proxy function. p  precodeFam[0][0], bm[0][1], c[0][2], dm[1][0], em[1][1], f[1][2] codepre  pis there any way around that such as unionp

Negative 32472 pIm searching for a solution to clean up after doing integration Tests in CQ5. We did manage after a while of research to run JUnit tests in CQ5 this is bad documented.  Now that everything is working as expected we are searching for a solution to run those Tests on a CQ5 server right with the mavendeployment, and cleaning up the test data afterwards. Like for example a test user or a test page we created for test purposes we dont want to have in the system afterwards. Is there a solution build in crx to do something like that  So far we also thought about doing a deployment with tests and afterwards again without tests, or doing a deployment with a snapshot right after, than run the tests and install the snapshot again. But all those solutions would be very time consuming, since we have many servers to deploy to, time is precious p

Negative 32472 pIm hoping that someone can help me out with this problem, or at least point out the error of my ways...  p  pAs a simple illustration of my problem consider a part of an application where you can enter a Functions Mode state of operation. Four submodes are then available depending on which function key F1F4 that the user presses. By default, F1 mode is entered. The state diagram starts off as follows  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVI05u.png altDiagram 1p  pThe user can press F1F4 at any time to switch to the corresponding mode. Adding these transitions to the inner states leads to the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSeR05.png altDiagram 2p  pObviously this is a a mess, and b a lot of transitions to define. If at some point I want to add an F5Mode then... well, you get the picture. To avoid this Id like to do the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comitPhV.png altDiagram 3p  pBoost Statechart allows me to define transitions from FunctionMode to any of the inner states, but the result isnt what I expected. The actual outcome is as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNgGGh.png altDiagram 4p  pI.e. pressing F1F4 to switch modes causes the outer FunctionMode state to be exited and reentered along with triggering the unwanted exit and entry actions.p  pWay back in 2006, a hrefhttpboost.2283326.n4.nabble.comstatechartUML20localtransitionsandhistorytd2557450.html relnofollowthis threada between the library author and a user seems to describe the same problem. I think that the author suggests doing the following as a workaroundp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBVRjR.png altDiagram 5 p  pHowever, that workaround doesnt seem very appealing to me It has added an extra state level to be compiled, the code has become less readable, deephistory would have to be used to return to any of the function mode substates and the Intermediate state object is needlessly being destructed and constructed again.p  pSo... where am I going wrong Or what are the alternatives  Ive had a brief look at Boost Meta State Machine msm but from what Ive seen so far I much prefer the look of Statechart.p  pIm surprised that more users havent faced the same problem... which makes me think that perhaps my approach is completely wrongp

However, in IE it takes two clicks to open up the drop down using this padding.p  pHow can I open up the drop down menu in IE by clicking on this padded area using a single click Im willing to use js if I absolutely have to but would like to avoid it.p  pSee this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netYTpnf1 relnofollowjsfiddlea for an example of the issue. Click the padded area on the left to see the functionality in IE. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI should clarify. I already have a styled dropdown which is a combination of css and regular HTML. The drop down has an arrow image on the left which is why the padding on the text is important. I dont want to change any of this. I only want it to function correctly in IE when the padded area is clicked.p  pstrongWORKAROUNDstrongp  pAs a workaround, I have removed the padding from the CSS and now I am padding the actual text in the options with codenbspcode to simulate padding. Very much a hack as it now stops any users from typing into the select box to jump to specific values.

It is on the left side, adjacent and will move with the scrollbar. p  pI am using the codeOnScrollListenercode to detect the scroll event. But I dont know how to get  the exact position of the scroll bar top, mid point, bottom, so that I can put the text box at the right place. There are many posts about getting the position of the top item but seems not for the scrollbar itself. p  pAny thoughtsp  pBTW, sorry for not attaching a screenshot of the UI. Stackoverflow doesnt allow me to do that since I am a new user. p

With the gui still open, I can execute the add method again and it stills returns a false value. Then I can click the button and see it is true value.  p  pI would think that when the gui is created and the boolean value is set to true.  I would be able to get the current value of the boolean in other classes. p  pI am not sure if I am not referencing the gui class correctly or when the gui is created I am not accessing the current thread or tableviewerp  pI dont know if this is a thread issue or I am just not getting the current value from the gui correctly.p  pThis is a big issue with my application right now.  I have to be able to refresh the tableviewer any time new data is added to the array. I can not have the user having to manually refresh the table every time that select new data p
Negative 32472 pUsing Python 3.2 I was hoping to solve the below issue. My data consist of hundreds of rows signifying a project and 21 columns. The first of which is a unique project ID and the other 20 columns is the group of people, or person, that led the project. person1 is always filled and if there is a name in person3 that means 3 people are working together. If there is a name in person18 that means 18 people are working together.p  pI have an excel spreadsheet that is setup the following wayp  precode unique ID person1      person 2      person3     person4   ...  person20     12       Tom           Sally          Mike     16       Joe           Mike     5        Joe           Sally     1       Sally          Mike           Tom     6       Sally          Tom            Mike     2       Jared          Joe            Mike        John      ...     Carl codepre  pI want to do a few thingsp  p1 Make a column that will give me a unique Group Name which will be, using unique ID 1 as my example, SallyMikeTom. So it will be the names separated by . p  p2 How can I treat, from my example, SallyMikeTom the same as SallyTomMike. Meaning, I would like another column that makes the group name in alphabetical order no matter the actual permutation, still separated by . p  p3 This question is similar to 2. However, I want the person listed in person1 to matter. Meaning JoeTomMike is different from TomJoeMike but not different than JoeMikeTom. So there will be another column that keeps person1 at the start of the group name but alphabetizes person2 through person20 if applicable i.e., if the project has more than 1 person on it.p  pThanks for the help and suggestionsp

But that introduces yet another different network connection instead of the local host one.p  pSo Is there a definite answer or what is the most likely offending componentconnection Where is the favoured place to start lookingp  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 32472 pI want to use template to render my output, just like Freemarker does, but I want to add customized constraints, for example, name[length gt 4 ampamp notEmpty], name is a variable, expression in [] is customized expression, length gt 4 means name.legnth is greater than 4, notEmpty means name is not null nor , if these constraints do not return true, template engine can stop rendering with throwing an exception or do something else. Every variable in template may have its own constraints, and I dont want to write too many [if][if] tagsit seems that Freemarker does not support stopping rendering if [if] returns false. I just search Freemarker, it doesnt support, do you know any other template engine can meet my demandp  pthanks.p

Negative 32472 pI am making use of a third party codeFooClientImplcode Java class, which implements the codeFooClientcode interfacep  precodeinterface FooClient      public FooOutput processFooFooInput inputData  codepre  pwhich processes data passed to it by communicating over a TCP socket on a particular port number on codelocalhostcode to a thirdparty, nonJava codefooservercode process. Each codeinputDatacode instance can be processed standalone i.e its embarrassingly parallel. codefooservercode is rather slow but just runs on a single core, so Id like to be able to manually fire up multiple instances of it on separate ports , and have multiple codeFooClientImplcode instances to access it  one for each server instance. So far this is easy.p  pHowever Id also like to create a codeConcurrentFooClientImplcode class which also implements the codeFooClientcode interface, but under the hood, keeps track of a pool of codeFooClientImplcode instances or subclass instances maybe 8, and processes the incoming data with the first unused instance after the code.processFoocode method is called waiting until one is available if necessary. That way, other code could instantiate codeConcurrentFooClientImplcode and it would look the same to the calling code, only faster.p  pIm very new to threading, and Ive walked through the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialconcurrencyindex.html relnofollowJava Concurrency tutoriala, but this use case seems somewhat different from the examples there. p  pI emthinkem I need to create a codeThreadcode subclass codeFooClientImplThreadcode which wraps a codeFooClientImplcode instance. And I think I also should use a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentExecutors.html relnofollowcodeExecutors.newFixedThreadPoolcodea to manage a fixedsize pool of clients, and that should maybe have a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentThreadFactory.html relnofollowcodeThreadFactorycodea which  produces instances of codeFooClientImplThreadcode. And then in codeConcurrentFooClientImpl.processFoocode I could wrap codeinputDatacode somehow in an implementation of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentCallable.html relnofollowcodeCallablecodea to submit them to the pool. But these instances would need to get hold of a particular codeFooClientcode instance so they could in turn call codeFooClientImplThread.processFoocode and actually talk to the codefooservercode running on the appropriate port. I emguessem they could call a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangThread.html relnofollowcodeThread.currentThreadcodea and cast the result to codeFooClientImplThreadcode. But intuitively that feels hacky to me although I dont know if  trust my intuition here, and Im not sure whether it would work or whether it is sensible..p  pAm I on the right track with my possible solution here, or is there a  more sane approach I should takep  pstrongUpdatestrong I ended up implementing a solution like the one described. Surprisingly, it mostly worked as expected, except of course I realised I hadnt thought through what would be needed for background processing while maintaining the outwardfacing API. As far as I can tell, this is not possible in the oneatattime callertriggered API I outlined above. It would need to be replaced by a producerconsumer pattern or something, which I ended up doing, albeit in a different way.p

Negative 32472 pI am hoping that there is a more elegant solution to this issue. Basically, I have a HTML  Javascript app that will be running on a touch screen kiosk. I am trying to prevent the default click behavior if someone is scrolling through a list of buttons by dragging their finger. At first I tried to preventDefault when it detected a swipe event. But then it occurred to me that it isnt really a swipe event so much as a long mousedown. So I wrote the following codep  precodevar downClick var startTime  .TPGSWwrapper.onmousedown, function        downClick  new Date     startTime  downClick.getTime    .TPGSWwrapper.onmouseup, function        var upClick  new Date     var endTime  upClick.getTime      if endTime  startTime lt 250          return false      else if endTime  startTime gt 300           This is the action that I cant seem to get to work.           I would like it to stop the click event. I also tried mouseup         this.onclick, function   preventDefault                       codepre  pThis correctly measures the time of the mousedown, but then I cant seem to stop the click event from firing. Any thoughts or suggestions I am using jquery and this for a webkit browser only. Thanks in advancep

Negative 32472 pWhat Im trying to do is build a windows application through VB 2012 Express in VB language to send serial commands over TCPUDP to networked television screens on the same network. NEC the company who made the panels have created a tool called PD Comms that does just this and works very well, however it is too complex for end users. My interface will have a single button that sends all the necessary powervolumeinput selection commands to all the TVs. p  pThe issue Im having is getting the TVs to accept my data stream. I believe the issue is to do with how Im sending the data to the panel. As a trial, Ive been working with a simple power on command to one of the four TVs. My application successfully opens a network stream when connected to the network so there is no issue with the IP address  port which I have inputted. My code to send this command is below.p  precodePrivate Sub Button1Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Button1.Click Dim client As New TcpClient10.71.208.61, 7142 Dim dataStream As NetworkStream  client.GetStream Dim commandData As Byte  1, 30, 41, 30, 41, 30, 43, 2, 43, 32, 30, 33, 44, 36, 30, 30, 30, 31, 3, 73, 0D dataStream.WritecommandData, 0, commandData.Length client.Close End Sub codepre  pI believe the line where I assign data to the commandData byte array is incorrect.

The version of gcc is codegcc version 4.7.2 Debian 4.7.25code. Compiling gives no warnings or errors.p  precodegcc test.c o test stdgnu99 codepre  pNow, I would expect that this simple program simply prints out the values that I initialise the array with. However, the output is thisp  precode .test  0 key  some value here, val  1. 1 key  null, val  0. 2 key  null, val  0. codepre  pThe two possible causes I can think of are that either my loop is incorrect, which makes no sense to me, or that the initialisation somehow is wrong. However, searching this site and in general on Google did not help me. I am open to other solutions as well, but also interested in just emwhyem this does not work.p  pThanksp

The table is active and a lot of rows are written into it, so dropping a column is not an option also locking the table for a long time.p  pQuick example of what I want to accomplishp  pI have this p  h2   id  nameh2  ul li1   Roy li li2   Boss li li5   Jane li li7   Janetli ul  pI want to reorganize it so it will look like this p  h2id  nameh2  ul li1   Royli li2   Bossli li3   Janeli li4   Janetli ul  pI am aware of DBCC CHECKIDENT TableName, RESEED,position but I am not sure it will benefit my case , because my table is big and it will take a lot of time to reposition also if I am not mistaken it will lock the table for a very long time.  This table is not used by any other table.  But if you like you can submit a suggestion to the same problem having in mind that the table is used by other tables.p  h2EDIT h2  pThe objective is to prove that the rows follow each other in case a row is deleted so I can see it is deleted and reinstate it.I was thinking of adding a third column that will contain a hash value from the row above , and if the row above is deleted I would know that I have a gap and need to restore it ,in that case the order will not matter because I can compare the has codes and see if they match , so I can see which row follows which.But still I wonder is there a more clever and safer way of doing this Maybe involve something else rather then hash codes , some other way of proving that the rows follow each other , or that the new row contains parts of the previous rowp  h2EDIT 2 h2  pIll try to explain it one more time if I cant well then I dont want to waste anyones time.p  pIn the perfect case scenario there will be nothing missing from this table , but due to server errors some data maybe deleted or some of my associates might be wasteful and delete it by fault.br I have logs and can recover that data, but I want to prove that the records are sequenced , that they follow each other even if there is a server error and some of them are deleted but later on reinstated. Is there a way to do this p  pExample well lets say that 7 is deleted and after that reinstated as 23 , how would you prove that 23 is 7, meaning that 23 came after 6 and before 8 p

Negative 32472 pI am building an application which is a simple form.  You place queries in a number of form elements and click submit. p  pThis submits a fairly large number of API calls to a 3rd party API to create the necessary objects in the third party app, perform them, then return the results to my app. p  pThe process takes 530 seconds.  p  pWhat I want this to do is render the results in a partial think SQL IDE, like SSMS or TOAD or whatever  input at top, returns results below.  And i would like this partial to refresh after each step in the process and display the status of the task to the user.  Currently the app just sits and spins until all of this complex and IO heavy business logic is complete, which is resulting in horrible user experience. p  pSo, lets say the steps taken through the 3rd party API arep  ol lipcreate widgetpli lipstart widgetpli lipmonitor widget statuspli lipWhen complete, return final results to user. pli ol  pWhat I want to do is have a variable, say status, which contains the current execution of the above process. Creating Widget... etc etc. This displays to the user as the tasks complete.p  pHow could i rerender the partial whenever one of these tasks are complete  Should it poll the server And how would I go about polling a process running serverside without the thread locking until the above steps are complete p  pCurrently, this is not written to a database, and I would like to keep the database out of this as much as possible due to load restrictions.  p  pNow, I am aware of different methods of polling to an action AJAX through jquery, primarily using setintervaltimeout to make calls to a controller action and rerender, but If my API call methods are referenced in that action, it simply waits until it is all done anyway. p  pAny thoughts p

Negative 32472 pI just want to clarify this doubt. I might be wrong. Ive learnt in OOP we should not repeat codes through out the classes according to the strongDRYstrong principle. However, if I checked the admin settings context and the public context check boxes, bonfire will create two controllers in the modulecontrollers folder in this case settings.php and mymodule.php. I can see the functions have been repeated. I feel like, I could just use one common controller for CRUD and load different public and admin views, or even for other context as well. Can some one help me to understand this Thanks a lotp

Negative 32472 pwe are developing an application which can track the user when heshe is out drivingwalkingbiking etc.  Ran into a problem on how to solve a connection error, now we just cancel the tracking, but I came up with an idea to store the coordinate which was dropped, and then use googles directionservice to draw a line once the connection is reestablished. So if the user disconnects, and then get the connection back after 5 minutes, we snap the line to the road, because its a fairly okay guess on whereas the user has been driving. Problem is that there is still only two coordinates, so once we store the track and try to display it on the map, there is a straight line. p  pQuestion is, is there any way to get the coordinates of the polyline, instead of just the two coordinates that we draw a directionsline inbetween p  pSorry for my fuzzy English, kind of hard to explain. Can try to give a more understandable explanation if this was to hard to understand.p  pThanks Joakimp

But even so, there are still other problems at hand.p  pIve tried codegetDatacode and codesetDatacode on the instance, but when I do codesetDatacode it ends up saving the table without any of the table tags.p  pThis is what I did for thatp  precodefunction PasteToFaxEnd      var faxText  CKEDITOR.instances.faxMessageBodyText.getData      faxText  lttable stylewidth600pxborder1px solid blackgtlttrgtlttd rowspan4 stylewidth50gtInstructionslttdgtlttdgtampnbsplttdgtlttrgtlttrgtlttdgtContactlttdgtlttrgtlttrgtlttdgtTitlelttdgtlttrgtlttrgtlttdgtEmail Addresslttdgtlttrgtlttablegt      CKEDITOR.instances.faxMessageBodyText.setDatafaxText  codepre  pThe result is just the text, no tags.p  pThis worked slightly better, but it stripped my code of the very important border style.p  precodefunction PasteToFaxEnd      CKEDITOR.instances.faxMessageBodyText.insertHtmllttable stylewidth600pxborder1px solid blackgtlttrgtlttd rowspan4 stylewidth50gtInstructionslttdgtlttdgtampnbsplttdgtlttrgtlttrgtlttdgtContactlttdgtlttrgtlttrgtlttdgtTitlelttdgtlttrgtlttrgtlttdgtEmail Addresslttdgtlttrgtlttablegt  codepre  pThe last thing I used was, instead of setting style on the table, I set a class instead, but I was not sure where I could put a class that the text inside the editor would read  it wasnt reading it from the page the editor was on.  With that said, this answer is not preferable I need to send this text on to a PDF generator and I would rather have the styles set on the code so that I dont have to deal with that when I get to the PDF generator.  I would appreciate it if I saw such a thing though, at the very least having that knowledge could be useful.p  pPerhaps the answer lies in codeinsertHtmlcode, but I need that border to remain somehow.

Negative 32472 pIm using the Google glog logging system in my project.  Specifically, Im using the following types of statements at various places in my codep  precodeinclude ltgloglogging.hgt CHECKEQfoo,bar ltlt Generic error message LOGERROR ltlt Generic error message LOGFATAL ltlt Generic error message codepre  pThis logging system is important in helping me to stage and verify my code. However, sometimes I farm out production runs of my code to a larger server.  This large production server doesnt have the logging system. Ive tried to build the logging system on this production server, but have run into problems.p  pSo, working on the assumption that I emcannotem use the logging system on the production server, how can I configure things so that the logging commands are inactive on the serverp  hr  pAttempting to solve this problem myself before asking on SO, I tried the following...p  pIn an existing header file named globals.h I definedp  precodeifdef NOGLOG     define MYLOGi,m stdcerr ltlt i ltlt   ltlt m else     include ltgloglogging.hgt     define MYLOGi,m LOGi ltlt m endif codepre  pThen, I can replace code like codeLOGERROR ltlt ab ltlt x ltlt cdcode with codeMYLOGERROR,ab ltlt x ltlt cdcode.  Then, when I build with a command like codemake all CUSTOMDNOGLOGcode, where my gcc compile statements are set up with a variable named codeCUSTOMcode, the glog statements will not get compiled, but instead simple codestdcerrcode statements will get compiled.p  pI ran into two problems with this approach 1 I could not figure out how to get the Eclipse IDE to insert codeCUSTOMcode into the gcc compile statements in the makefile that Eclipse generates and 2 putting the codeinclude ltgloglogging.hgtcode statement inside the codeelsecode body caused lots of error messages like the one below.p  precodeIn file included from usrincludeerrno.h36,                  from usrlocalincludegloglogging.h39,                  from ..globals.h23,                  from ..COMPASS.h11,                  from ..COMPASS.cpp13 usrincludebitserrno.h In function int errnolocation usrincludebitserrno.h43 error expected primaryexpression before , token codepre  pstrongNotestrong For the time being, I just commentedout the codeCHECKEQcode calls, with the thinking that once I figure out how to fix this problem with respect to the codeLOGcode calls, I should be able to easily extend the solution to the codeCHECKEQcode calls.p
Negative 32472 pI have a scenario in which I want to reuse an existing class to compile changes in the system. The existing libraries take a file pointer that will store the changes for subsequent use. The current scenario involves performing those calculations and then immediately outputting the response to output.p  pWould it be safe to use the phptemp or phpmemory resources in an environment where it is possible that two separate users will run this method at the same timep  pPseudocodep  precodefp  fopenphptemp,w LibgetUpdatesfp, userid rewindfp changes  streamgetcontentsfp codepre  pI have been googling around and have found some unsettling results but nothing really definitive about using the temp or memory streams.p  pSo the question is, should I just break down and use a temporary file that will guarantee this isnt a problem I would like to avoid writing to disk if possible.

I have copied the schema commands directly and run a copy of the query from fiddle.  I checked both and they are identical code.  I verified same 5.1.61 mysql version between my db and fiddle.  In the live db, 3 rows are returned for id 2 and on fiddle only 2 rows are returned desired effect.  Could fiddle be altering the query before passing it throughp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a table of data that is being kept as a history of scan results.  Typically it is used to plot trends of the results over time, but I would like to try something else.  I want to provide the most recent trend upwards or down as a percentage if there are at least 2 data points.  More specifically, I would like to also constrain this to the most recent 7 days to limit the scope of the trends to the active projects.p  pNote the table is only updated on the first time a project is run and also if the issuescount has changed from a previous run.p  pstrongSample Tablestrongp  precodeid  issuescount  updated 1   7922          20131002 082231 1   7981          20131003 082243 2   7754          20131010 120645 2   7922          20131011 120645 2   7981          20131012 020943 3   15536         20131012 020943 4   1233          20131011 120645 4   2493          20131012 020943 5   4349          20131012 020944 codepre  pstrongTable Structurestrongp  precodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS issuehistory    id bigint20 unsigned NOT NULL,   issuescount mediumint8 unsigned NOT NULL,   updated timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENTTIMESTAMP,   KEY idindex id  ENGINEMyISAM DEFAULT CHARSETascii codepre  pstrongResults logicstrongp  pIn the above sample, I want to ignore both 1 id entries because they are older than 7 days from today.

Then my code would have to remove results with less than 2 rows per id.  Likely I would pursue making a subquery select out of the first and embedding into the second.  I still think this is not the best approach, but should function.p  pMy concern is this table can grow at the rate of a couple thousand rows a day and I would like to try to take the least amount of time possible for the command to be run.  I especially dont want to hit the db twice from the program.p

Negative 32472 pI am writing to a database log for my application.  One of the fields in the table is codeuserprofileidcode which references a username.  This is a nullable field, as some stuff gets written to the log without a user context.p  pIn NHibernate, to collect the username, I really cant look at the reference column though, but rather the referenced object.  In most cases this is fine if its null, theres just no username.  So when trying to display the username associated with the log, I actually have to reference the codeLog.User.UserNamecode.p  pThe twist comes in in that I have a system account with a rigid set of permissions and no associated user profile to invoke automated tasks through the api interface.  It writes to the log as codeuserprofileidcode emsystemem, which does not exist in my codeUserProfilescode table.p  pTo make this work, I had to remove the foreign key between the logs table and the codeUserProfilescode table, but the data is logged, and NHibernate doesnt seem to care.  It just reports the codeUserProfilecode object as null, which is technically correct.p  pI would actually like to see the text of the codeuserprofileidcode field through NHibernate though, even though it wont join to the codeUserProfilescode table, so I can differentiate the log entries that have no user context and those that have a system function context.p  pIs there a way, in NHibernate, to request the value of the reference field, rather than the associated object  Or am I going to have to do something customp

Now, the user can also specify a users namep  precodeordertool display customerName Bob Smith codepre  pBUT the interface to query for orders relies on customer IDs. Thus, we need to map from a customer name to a customer ID. To do this, we need a connection to the customer API. Thus, the user has to specifyp  precodeordertool display customerName Bob Smith customerApi httplocalhost8080customer codepre  pWhen starting the application, I want to parse all the arguments. In the case where codecustomerApicode is specified, I want to place a CustomerApi singleton in my IoC context  which is parameterized by the CLI arg with the API URL.p  pThen, when the code runs to display a customer by name  it asks the context if it has a CustomerApi singleton. If it doesnt it throws an exception, telling the CLI user that they need to specify codecustomerApicode if they want to use codecustomerNamecode. However, if one has been created  then it simply retrieves it from the IoC context.p
Negative 32472 pYesterday I had an issue where a code.onclickcode event handler I was assigning wasnt working right. Turns out its because I was was trying to apply that code.onclickcode before that element existed in the DOM, because it was being loaded via AJAX, and therefore didnt exist yet when the codedocument.readycode got to that point.p  pI solved it with an awkward workaround, but my question is, if I were to put a codeltscriptgtcode tag IN the ajax loaded content and another codedocument.readycode within that, would that second codedocument.readycode be parsed ONLY once that ajax content is done being loaded In other words, does it consider that separately loaded ajax content to be another codedocumentcode, and if so, does having another codedocument.readycode within that ajaxloaded HTML work the way I think it doesp  pAlternatively what would be a better way to handle this situation needing to attach an event listener to a DOM element that doesnt yet exist on codedocument.readycodep

Negative 32472 pIm new to Twitter Bootstrap 3 and have read through their documentation and understand how to nest columns but I have a different problem.

Negative 32472 pI would like to make a single round trip to an MSSQL database to retrieve multiple tables. Each table relies in one way or another on the same somewhat expensive lookup, which will grab a bunch of IDs and handle pagination and very basic filtering. So Im trying to move the expensive part out so it happens only once, and reuse its result set multiple times afterwards.p  pBelow is a really strippeddown version of what Im trying to do. The primary query is the expensive lookup thats common to the next other queries below it. The first result set should return what I want, as you would expect, but the second result set fails because the primary query is out of scope. p  precode Primary query WITH tItemId, Row AS      SELECT ItemId, ROWNUMBER OVERORDER BY DateCreated DESC AS Row     FROM Items    First result set SELECT   FROM Items INNER JOIN t ON Items.ItemId  t.ItemId WHERE t.Row lt 10   Second result set SELECT  FROM Photos INNER JOIN ItemPhotos ON Photos.PhotoId  ItemPhotos.PhotoId INNER JOIN t ON ItemPhotos.ItemId  t.ItemId WHERE t.Row lt 10 codepre  pIs there a way to do this so that the second result set worksp  pI would like to avoid creating temp tables because, in my experience, there is almost always a cheaper alternative that Ive just not learned yet. In this case, Im not sure theres an alternative, but Im hoping someone knows a way around it. Ill test both of course.p  pI know that in the example above you can probably return a single result set by doing an codeINNER JOINcode on the whole thing, but in my case its not a workable solution as the result set would be massive.p

Negative 32472 pSo, again, making a pong clone, and run into a bump. Im creating the codegamecode class gamestate for my state machine and in the definition, I instantiate two classes of the class Ive created for the the different player paddles and I give them two different arguments that will decide if the class becomes the player one or player two object. But it seems like the program wont allow me to pass an argument in the class definition. Ive tried to put the class instantiation in the codegamecode class constructor but then the eventslogicrender functions dont have access to the paddle classes. That leads me to think it has to be in the codegamecode class definition.

Now I know that means it wants something like codeint playercode but I need to pass a number so that the constructor can decide which player itll be, which ultimately decides what keys move the class up and down the screen. So to be perfectly clear, I want to be able to pass an argument to a class instantiation so that the class constructor can turn the class into the left OR the right paddle. So how do I go about instantiating a class, inside another class, using argumentsp  pThanksp  pEDIT For the constructor problem I have another example that is fully coded where I cant put the class initializer in the constructor.

Negative 32472 pThe task that I am put at hand is pretty simple. I know how to execute normal files and programs in Python, what I have to do is first create a Python program that will execute 2 .exe files then, extract a zip file, after that, again run the file inside the zip file.p  pI know how the execution and everything else works. Why I am trying to do this Dont ask, it is such a old method of doing things at our company, each program has its own function of copying database files. And the ZIP file is to store the smaller version of the file with the database records. I know, confusing, but I dont do much of the sys admin there.p  pAnyway, I have now hit a brick wall, how on earth do I get Python to extract a ZIP file I tried it with the ZipFile module, but it is really confusing.

Negative 32472 pim using Cocos2diphone v3.0 combined with spritebuilder to build my app.I just recently got iAd working following the answer seen here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21771126howtoaddiadincocosspritebuilderHow to add iAd in CocosSpriteBuilderap  pSo i wont repeat any of the code, the only thing I changed from the posted answer was adView to bannerView in init statement. Now I have adds showing where I want but I dont know how to hide them. I would like to have the adds only visible in the game scene after you loose. When you loose I run a gameover event that displays your highscore and a restart button amongst other things so setting a variable like canShowAds to true there and false when the scene starts seems like what I would have to do but I dont know how to only run the ads when its equal to true. Also I plan on having a remove ads button so I would need to check if that has been purchased. If you need anymore code posted I will gladly post it.   p

Negative 32472 pAfter having a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22469188deepdiveinstallationpostgresqlerrormany problemsa installing the a hrefhttpdeepdive.stanford.edu relnofollowDeepDive projecta on Ubuntu, I decided to write out a detailed guide. These problems were based on the output from the codetest.shcode file provided with the source  I cant speak to the functionality of the source just yet just starting to learn.p  pBecause I messed up a few configuration files, and this is still early in my Ubuntu experience, I decided to reinstall the OS Precise 12.04 and redo everything from scratch. So, this guide is based off of a clean version of Ubuntu 12.04, after installing all relevant updates via Update Manager as of 20Mar2014.p  pDeepDive gives us a few prerequisites Java, Python 2.X, PostgreSQL, and SBT. Ubuntu 12.04 already has Python 2.X, so well worry about the others.p  pWere going to go with the Ubuntu recommended OpenJDK7. Enter the following in the terminal.p  precodesudo aptget update sudo aptget install openjdk7jdk icedtea7plugin codepre  pNow, lets install SBT. Use the following link to a hrefhttprepo.scalasbt.orgscalasbtsbtnativepackagesorgscalasbtsbt0.13.1sbt.deb relnofollowdownload the debian filea or get it a hrefhttpwww.scalasbt.orgreleasedocsGettingStartedSetup.html relnofollowfrom the sitea. SBT has a dependence on curl, so first Ill install that.p  precodesudo aptget install curl cd hometomDownloads sudo dpkg i sbt.deb codepre  pNow I need to install PostgreSQL, which was by far the trickiest part. In this tutorial, Im assuming that the computer youre working on will also be the PostgreSQL host. Its also important to note that DeepDive uses JSON, which is apparently not supported by PostgreSQL 9.1 and under. To install version 9.3, Im going to use the instruction given by Danny in a hrefhttpaskubuntu.comquestions186610howdoiupgradetopostgres92this StackExchange posta, and just change the numbers to 9.3 p  precodewget O  httpapt.postgresql.orgpubreposaptACCC4CF8.asc  sudo aptkey add  sudo gedit etcaptsources.list.dpgdg.list codepre  pAdd the following line strongto the filestrong, then save and closep  precodedeb httpapt.postgresql.orgpubreposapt precisepgdg main codepre  pNote that precisepgdg corresponds to your Ubuntu version.

First, I need to install git, since Im on a fresh version of the OS. Then, the instructions come from the a hrefhttpdeepdive.stanford.edudocinstallation.html relnofollowDeepDive pagea.

Negative 32472 pIm trying to create child classes in Perl that inherit class functions from a single parent. I got it to partially work, using the object method syntax codeChildgtinheritedMethodcode to call inherited functions outside the child, and codemy classshift classgtinheritedMethodcode inside the child class, as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2305386howcanioverrideaparentclassfunctionwithchildoneinperl23054132305413herea.p  pHowever, for inherited methods, it seems control is passed to parent class, and the method is run in the parent scope with the parent variables. For example, this is in the Parent classp  precodeour VERSION  0.11 our NICKNAME  Parent Base sub version VERSION  sub whoami NICKNAME  sub whereami   my class  shift   print should be printing whereami right now...n   print  In ,caller1[3], of ,classgtwhoami, ,classgtversion, in ,PACKAGE,n   codepre  pEach child class declares its own codeVERSIONcode and codeNICKNAMEcode, which I hoped would be accessed in place of the parent variables. But when I call codewhereamicode from the child, it gives code ChildMethod of Parent Base 0.11 in Parentcode.p  pQuestionsp  ul lipIs there a way around this Some other module I should use like Moose Export all the methods instead of inheritance, which I hear shouldnt be done polluting the namespace, not a problem herepli lipWould this still be an issue using objects and object attributesvariables Im trying to avoid it due to my teams aversion to objectoriented.pli liIs this how inheritance usually works, or just Perl I thought the method would be called within the scope of the child class, not passed to the parent.li ul

Negative 32472 pIm pretty new to programming, so I apologize in advance if this turns out to be very easy to solve.p  pTo increase my skills, Ive been designing small JSbased websites and then moving on to another, more complex website after Ive completed the one before it.p  pIm currently working on a website that helps you plan a character in a certain video game Dark Souls II, in case anyone is wondering. This website has a dropdown menu where you can select from one of eight starting classes. After choosing one, the website updates to show that particular class stats. p  pIn addition to showing each class starting stats, theres also a section that allows you to increase or decrease a stat in order to plan out your character in advance. This is where Ive run into my problem. p  pThe increase function that Im using works fine, but Im having problems with the function to decrease a stat. Ideally, I want it to decrease a stat BUT not beyond what the starting point for that stat is. It works fine until I try to decrease a stat that STARTED below 10 back down beneath 10.p  pFor example, the Warrior class starts with 7 Vigor. I can increase it up to 9, and then decrease it back down to 7. However, when I increase it to 10 and then try the decrease button, nothing works. However, on classes that have a starting Vigor of a number greater than 10, I can increase and decrease with no problems at all. The code Im using as is followsp  precodefunction decreaseVigor    for i  0 i lt classStats.length i      if chosenClass  classStats[i][0]        if vigor.innerHTML gt startingVigor.innerHTML          soulLevel.innerHTML  classStats[i][1]  1         vigor.innerHTML  classStats[i][2]  1                 codepre  pI know the problem lies within the second If statement, but I dont know why its not working.

Negative 32472 pI have been trying out a wav joiner program in vb.net to join wav files and although its working fine some of the time, often the resultant wav file doesnt play. After peeking into the original wav files, I noticed that the data subchunk where the word data is was starting at offset 38 instead of 36. That is whats messing up the joiner which assumes offset 36. When I reexported that wav file from audacity, it fixed it up and the data subchunk starts at 36. All programs play the original file fine so I guess its valid. Why are there two extra 00 bytes values right before the word data in those wav filesp

Negative 32472 pI have written a BigInteger class in C that should be able to do operations on all numbers with any size. Currently I am trying to achieve a very fast multiplication method by comparing the existing algorithms and test for which amount of digits they work best and I ran into very unexpected results.I tried to do 20 multiplications of 500digit and I timed them. This was the result p  precodekaratsuba   14.178 seconds  long multiplication   0.879 seconds codepre  pWikipedia told me p  blockquote   pIt follows that, for sufficiently large n, Karatsubas algorithm will perform fewer shifts and singledigit additions than longhand multiplication, even though its basic step uses more additions and shifts than the straightforward formula. For small values of n, however, the extra shift and add operations may make it run slower than the longhand method. The point of positive return depends on the computer platform and context. As a rule of thumb, Karatsuba is usually faster when the multiplicands are longer than 320640 bits.p blockquote  pSince my numbers are at least 1500 bits long this is quite unexpected because wikipedia said karatsuba should run faster. I believe that my problem might be in my addition algorithm but I dont see how I could make it faster because its already running in On. Ill post my code below so that you can check my implementations. Ill leave the irrelevant parts out of it.br I was also thinking that maybe the structure I used was not the best possible. I represented each data segment in little endian.

Negative 32472 pIm getting started with SQL. So far, most of my experience is either with simple queries using C then performing operations on the data in C, or designing [relatively] more complex queries with MS Access design view.p  pI was recently assigned a task to review a relatively large query hundreds of rows for a single Select, and there are minimal comments in the code. Also, Im not familiar with the database being queried. Even though the syntax seems relatively simple, there are so many joins on top of joins that its hard to wrap my head around. p  pIdeally, Id like to have some graphical representation, similar to MS Access design view. Note that my current position uses SSMS. Im aware there are tools that can create SQL code from a UML diagram. Im also aware that there are tools that can create a ER diagram from SQL code a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7528118sqltoumldiagramorgraphictoolsee this questiona, which is closer to what Im looking for.

Negative 32472 pIn my scripting exploits I often check to see if a script has been written previously before I begin from scratch.  Often I can at least find some of what I need through google or other means.  I then adapt what I find to my needs and put it into production.  As a best practice, I comment my code and include author information Im not a fan of plagiarizing.  However there becomes the question of how and when its appropriate to addchange that author designation.  Ill use a sample script from Ed Wilson off his blog for referencep  precodeFunction GetOutlookCalendar      lt    .Synopsis     This function returns appointment items from default Outlook profile    .Description     This function returns appointment items from default Outlook profile. It     uses the Outlook interop assembly to use the olFolderCalendar enumeration.     It creates a custom object consisting of Subject, Start, Duration, Location     for each appointment item.    .Example     GetOutlookCalendar      whereobject  .start gt [datetime]5102011 AND .start lt      [datetime]5172011   sortobject Duration     Displays subject, start, duration and location for all appointments that     occur between 51011 and 51711 and sorts by duration of the appointment.     The sort is shortest appointment on top.    .Notes     NAME  GetOutlookCalendar     AUTHOR ed wilson, msft     LASTEDIT 05102011 083642     KEYWORDS Microsoft Outlook, Office     HSG HSG05242011    .Link      Httpwww.ScriptingGuys.comblog     Requires Version 2.0     gt      AddType AssemblyName Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook  OutNull     olFolders  Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.OlDefaultFolders as [type]     outlook  NewObject ComObject Outlook.Application     namespace  outlook.GetNameSpaceMAPI     folder  namespace.getDefaultFolderolFoldersolFolderCalendar     folder.items          SelectObject Property Subject,Start,Duration,Location  codepre  pI view the author field as the point of contact for that script as its the person who wrote it and understands it.  Is there a general rule of thumb as to how much a script is changed before it no longer makes sense to list the original author  Or are they always the author and then youre an editorp  pIn the case of the latter, whats the appropriate way to designate that  Is it that you add a line under Author labeled Editor and change the last edit label  How exactly is the right way to document your contributions  Is there a documented best practicep
Negative 32472 pI have an existing JBoss Application that I want to enable as a SAML2 SP. Easy enough, but this is a multitenant application where the host name is used to determine which IP if any to redirect to. If no IP is configured, it should fall through to a form login. The configuration below does not do what I want the second PicketLinkSP hides the first one. p  pThis is a lowvolume application with dozens of tenants, so we would prefer strongnotstrong to deploy a war file for each tenant.  Currently, only a few clients have expressed interest in hosting a SAML2 IP so if we had to we could deploy dedicated instances for these few, but if there is a better solution, that would be sweet.p  precodeltPicketLink xmlnsurnpicketlinkidentityfederationconfig2.1gt   ltPicketLinkSP xmlnsurnpicketlinkidentityfederationconfig2.1       ServerEnvironmenttomcat BindingTypeREDIRECT RelayStatesomeURLgt     ltIdentityURLgtidp.urlhttpbip.archxmidpltIdentityURLgt     ltServiceURLgtsample.urlhttpbip.archxmsampleltServiceURLgt     ltTrustgt       ltDomainsgtbip.archxmltDomainsgt     ltTrustgt           ltPicketLinkSPgt   ltPicketLinkSP xmlnsurnpicketlinkidentityfederationconfig2.1       ServerEnvironmenttomcat BindingTypeREDIRECT RelayStatesomeURLgt     ltIdentityURLgtidp.urlhttpccm.archxmidpltIdentityURLgt     ltServiceURLgtsample.urlhttpccm.archxmsampleltServiceURLgt     ltTrustgt       ltDomainsgtccm.archxmltDomainsgt     ltTrustgt           ltPicketLinkSPgt   ltHandlers xmlnsurnpicketlinkidentityfederationhandlerconfig2.1gt     ltHandler classorg.picketlink.identity.federation.web.handlers.saml2.SAML2LogOutHandler gt     ltHandler classorg.picketlink.identity.federation.web.handlers.saml2.SAML2AuthenticationHandlergt       ltOption KeyASSERTIONSESSIONATTRIBUTENAME Valueorg.picketlink.sp.assertiongt     ltHandlergt     ltHandler classorg.picketlink.identity.federation.web.handlers.saml2.RolesGenerationHandlergt     ltHandler classorg.picketlink.identity.federation.web.handlers.saml2.SAML2IssuerTrustHandlergt   ltHandlersgt ltPicketLinkgt codepre

Negative 32472 pThere was a query in production which was running for several hours56 hours. I looked into its execution plan, and found that it was ignoring a parallel hint on a huge table. Reason  it was using TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID. So after I added a code fullhugetable code hint before the codeparallelhugetablecode hint, the query started running in parallel, and it finished in less than 3 minutes. What I could not fathom was the reason for this emHUGEem difference in performance.  The following are the advantages of parallel FTS I can think ofp  ol liParallel operations are inherently fast if you have more idle CPUs.li liParallel operations in 10g are direct IO which bypass     buffer cache which means there is no risk of buffer busy waits or     any other contention for buffer cache.li ol  pSure there are the above advantages but then again the following disadvantages are still therep  ol liParallel operations still have to do IO, and this IO would be more than what we have for TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID as the entire table is scanned and is costlierall physical readsli liParallel operations are not very scalable which means if there arent enough free resources, it is going to be slowli ol  pWith the above knowledge at hand, I see only one reason that could have caused the poor performance for the query when it used ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID  some sort of contention like busy buffer waits. But it doesnt show up on the AWR top 5 wait events. The top two events were db file sequential read and db file scattered read. Is there something else that I have missed to take into consideration Please enlighten me.p

Negative 32472 pIm using an MVC structure in my windows form application, where all of the business logic for the form is being calculated in a separate controller class. One of the challenges Im facing is that, under certain circumstances in the controllers logic, a Messagebox needs to be shown on the form to the user. Ive been trying to accomplish this by creating a new exception that will be handled on the form that will contain the message to be shown in the messagebox, but Ive recently found that this probably wont be enough Ill also need YESNO message boxes, and messageboxes with different icons. I dont think that my custom exception can pack that kind of information within it. Ive been told I might see some success if I instead use a delegate or eventtype structure, but Im not exactly sure how this would be implemented.p  pAny suggestions are apprecated  thanks for your helpp

Negative 32472 pRecently I dug a bit deeper into the matter of network protocols and the OSI model, when noticed, that incoming TCP datagrams correct me if this is the wrong term are splitted into several parts, when they exceed a certain size  in this case its propably my routers MTU. I captured those datagrams using SharpPcap in order to extract some information i am looking for, if you are wondering where I got this information from.p  pAnyway I was wondering if the reassembly of fragmented packets shouldnt be task of the IP layer, since it definitely provides information to accomplish this id, fragmentation flags, fragment offset. Furthermore I read, that the TCP layer is to be interpreted as a streambased protocol. But this actually implies, that its up to the TCP layer to care about filling the applications buffer the emrightem way, so that the initial piece of information is reconstructed and may be flushed emupem all further layers.p  pBefore I made this observation I actually thought, that the TCP layer should care about reassembling those datagrams, but none of the mentioned layers does... p  pThis leads to the following questions  strongWhy are the TCP datagrams I receive not reassembledstrong and strongwhat layer SHOULD actually take care about thisstrongp

Negative 32472 pIve been working on a context menu module in ReactJS, and its got me thinking about how to deal with nonhierarchical components.p  pThe problem Im running into is that many different items in an application may want to use a context menu. Normally in React, you pass a callback from a parent object to the children that need to communicate with the parent. For example, my first thought was to have an codeopenContextMenumousePosition, optionsObjectcode function passed from my codeContextMenucode class to all the elements that want to display a context menu on rightclick.p  pBut it doesnt make sense for all such elements or maybe even any to be children of a context menu The context menu is not hierarchical with respect to other components of the application. In Angular, I would probably write a codeContextMenucode service that components required if they wanted access to such a menu.p  pIs this a situation in which a global event handler should be used Am I thinking about this all wrong Whats the React way to handle this kind of horizontal interaction between componentsp

Negative 32472 pI am having an error with a mobile app built with AngularJS and Ionic Framework on Cordova  PhoneGap.  I have released a build to some users to test and only a few users are telling me that their username and passwords arent authenticating.  I cant replicate the error since it only seems to be with these few individuals with problems.  p  pMy code is below.  It connects to one of our servers and checks the username and password. It will return 1 if usernamepass is valid or 0 if invalid with JSONP format.  If the request fails, then the http request has an error handler that will print out the error code.  I added an alert to pop up the status for http errors and the user told me they got a 404 error. AngularJS with 1.3.0 and 1.2.17 had the same issues. p  pI am confused as to why some users might have problems.

Negative 32472 pI have a gridview that I need to implement drag and drop feature. Ive been trying to find a possible solution or existing library that would fit my problem but still no luck.p  pHeres a before and after illustration of the drag and drop that I need to implementp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commWlt6.png altenter image description herep  pThe red tiles are items wherein they cannot be dragged nor dropped on. the blue ones are draggable and can be dropped on any tile on any row, just not on the red tiles. The white tiles are just placeholders which are placed to have the red tiles on the first column.p  pNow, when tile A is dragged on the 3rd row, as you can see, they go side by side, not swapped, even if put on top of tile C. The number of white tiles is depending on the number of blue tiles per row, an arraylist is assigned on each row, so itll just follow. My real problem is that all examples on gridview drag and drop is that tiles swaps or the whole grid follows the flow of items.p  pMy plan to implement thisp  ol liWhen long pressed on a tile to be dragged, it will show a tile that looks like that tile, only larger and lesser opacity.li liWhen dropped on a certain position, will compute for the row.li liAdjust arraylists and notifydatasetchanged.li ol  pHeres breaking down the problem to slightly smaller problemsp  ol liHow can I make a larger tile of the long pressed tileli liIs it possible to get the position where the enlarged tile is droppedli ol  pI hope I explained it clearly enough.

Negative 32472 pSo I was trying to test out a super short function for getting me the integer value of certain bits x through y from an integer, but am having some trouble with the sign extension that is happening.

I also ran the code using just addr and had it as an unsigned int, but that didnt change the output either.p  pThe output value for index is 536870912 when I run the function in gdb on a linux machine, and on compile online now coding ground, the value that I get is 67108864.p  pEdit A couple people have asked how I got the value 536870912, I have gotten it running gdb through both breakpoints and running the command codep getindex1code from gdb.

Negative 32472 pI am developing a mobile app which shows content uploaded in users neighborhood. So the basic requirements arep  ol liUsers location could change as user travelsli liUser will be presented list of neighboring content. Neighbor content is defined by content created in Xmile circle, with users location at center. li liContent in the list can be as old as possible. Which means that the list of content has to have pagination. Pull up to load more.li liScale of the application could be hugeli ol  pI am planning to use MongoDB for data storage. MongoDB supports geospatial indexes. So I can search any document created in vicinity of a geopoint. But the plan is to target very high scale right from the start. Which means that we need to use sharding in Mongo. But Mongo doesnt allow geospatial index as the shard key index. Which means that if I try to find data based on a geospatial index, it would potentially go to all shards to fetch data. And then Mongo will collect the data and filter out the amount of data which I need. This looks like not that optimal process to me.p  pTo overcome this problem I am planing to have shard index which would contain low precision geo location of the content. Let us say if location is 30.73983390 N, 76.78270199 E, low precision geo location as per my algorithm would almost be like 30.7398 N, 76.7827 E. This low precision geo location will be stored in document as a string, e.g. 30.739876.7827. Now I can create shard based on this low precision geo location represented as string. My query to fetch records would look likep  pfetch 100 documents WHEREp  ol lilow precision location string  ....    This would would use shard indexli ol  pANDp  ol ligeo location of document within XYZ of the users location. This would use geospatial index. li ol  pThis would give me benefit that query will go to one shardfirst condition. And then will run geospatial query on that shardsecond condition. This way there is no effort required at Mongo end to collect data from different shards and then trim based on the amount of content required.p  pAny better way of solving this problemp

Negative 32472 pIn my Symfony2 application I created a custom form to edit objects of a codeUsercode class. Users have a codepasswordcode property which contains a hash of the users password. For obvious reasons, I do not want to echo this propertys value into a field. However, I want a password field on my form so that when editing a user it is possible to change the users password.p  pThis password field should behave as followsp  ul lisIf the user has a password set, then the field should contain codecode.sli lisIf the user has no password set, then the field should be empty.sli liIt turns out the previous two points are impossible to achieve with my current architecture, so instead I am going for When the page is loaded, the field should be empty, regardless of whether the user has a password set.li liIf the field is posted with content, then the users password should be set to the hashed value of the field.li liIf the field is posted empty, the users password should not be changed and, more importantly, not cleared.li ul  pI thought of implementing this with a custom data transformer. However, the data transformer does not provide me with a way to skip updating the users codepasswordcode property when the password field is posted empty.p  pWhere do I need to extend the framework to add custom logic deciding which fields should be updatedp  h2UPDATEh2  pThis is the legacy code I am trying to replacep  precode SomeController.php   pass  requestgtgetpassword if strlenpass gt 5 ampamp strlenpass lt 16      factory  thisgtgetsecurity.encoderfactory     encoder  factorygtgetEncoderuser     password  encodergtencodePasswordpass, usergtgetSalt      usergtsetPasswordpassword  codepre  pI can live with removing the string length checks. All I want to check is whether something has been entered.p  pAs you can see, I can not simply move this code to a data transformer as it needs to access the codeusercode which is the user we are currently editing. I dont think it is a good idea to create a service providing this value.p

Negative 32472 pI am building an app that on its first run ask for a licensing key to verify with my server and then runs offline afterwards.

Now that people change the devices every next year i want that I could block the app from running in their old device and give them a new key for their new device.p  pNow the problem is that my app runs offline. It only connects to internet when user want backup of his data. So how can I schedule a background task in my app that runs after every 30 days without users intervention and checks the key status on server. And if user dont have internet connection then app should wait for whenever the internet connection is available and then check the status. App need not to be running for this job.

Negative 32472 pThe classic Builder Pattern requires fields to be declared in the classtobebuilt and the exact same fields to be declared in the builder class.  This can lead to problems when there are many fields and, during refactoring, the field types are not kept in sync.  Heres an example of what I mean I borrowed this code sample from an article by Joshua Blockp  precode Builder Pattern public class NutritionFacts      private final int servingSize     private final int servings     private final int calories     private final int fat     private final int sodium     private final int carbohydrate      public static class Builder          private int servingSize    0         private int servings       0         private int calories       0         private int fat            0         private int carbohydrate   0         private int sodium         0          public Builder servingSizeint val              servingSize  val   return this          public Builder servingsint val              servings  val      return this          public Builder caloriesint val              calories  val      return this          public Builder fatint val              fat  val           return this          public Builder carbohydrateint val              carbohydrate  val  return this          public Builder sodiumint val              sodium  val        return this           public NutritionFacts build              return new NutritionFactsthis                    private NutritionFactsBuilder builder          servingSize   builder.servingSize         servings      builder.servings         calories      builder.calories         fat           builder.fat         sodium        builder.sodium         carbohydrate  builder.carbohydrate       codepre  pNow lets assume that codeservingSizecode needs to be changed from codeintcode to codelongcode and that this change is done in codeNutritonFactscode but, by accident, not also done in the static codeBuildercode.p  pAdmittedly less problematic is the number of fields.  codeNutritionFactscode has 6 fields and, therefore, so does codeBuildercode.  What if there were 20 or 100 fields  Duplicating them all in codeNutritionFactscode and codeBuildercode would be  real pain.  Is there a better way so that all the duplication and potential for typesyncing errors can be avoidedp

Negative 32472 pThis may seem that I am asking a silly question to those who already know. Have you ever noticed how hard it is to find these Setting value constants to properties of some MFC control you are just starting to learn. Wouldnt it be nice, if I could just go to some tome of knowledge or because the information is too large to put in a book, then a website where you could drill down to the control and method or property you want to look up to find what setting constants are acceptable...p  pFor example, I am working with a codeCListCtrlcode on my codeCDialogcode could even be codeCDialogExcode if needed and I would like to set the Verticle amp Horizontal lines or gridlines to this control. You would think I would find an example. So far I havent. Another one is the codeCListCtrlcode Column Format. I found codeLVCFMTLEFTcode, I however am looking for something like codeLVCFMTCENTERcode and that isnt it. So I just comb the internet looking to see if I can glimpse my answer from someones question regarding something else on codeCListCtrlcodes.p  pIf anyone can guide me on my quest, I would appreciate it.p  pMaddogp

Negative 32472 pI really need help in Excel 2013, using conditional formatting i think. I have a few work sheets that i need to draw data from in a summary page. In this summary page obviously I need to use colour, which i can do, but to further complicate things, Im trying to find out that if a cell in, call in worksheet 2, shows 1, the summary worksheet must not only change colour, but it must replace the number 1 with ship  cell colours green. If the cell says 2, the summary page must say road, and cell colours orange, if the cell says 3, summary page must say air and change colour to red. Is there anyway that it can be done this wayp  pPlease help, I just cannot find anything that helps  Plus Im not very Excel advanced.p

Negative 32472 pThe premise is that person 1 wants to send a secret message M without key sharing across the ocean to person 2.  She decides to send partial messages via 3 ships such than if any two ships versions get delivered person 2 can construct the complete original message. The goal is to make each partial message M1,M2,M3 undecipherable by itself. In the case that all 3 messages arrive the redundant message can be used as ECCparity.p  pAssume the message is comprised of a series of 8bit characters m1,m2,m3...,mM. In the most efficient encoding lenM1M2M3 will be 1.5X lenM.p  pAn inefficient coding is M1 each character is comprised of the upper nibble UN plus the lower nibble LN, M2 is comprised of UN minus LN, M3 is is simply LN. M1 and M2 use 5 bits per character, M3 uses 4 bits per character.  p  pNote the assignment could be rotated such that M1 gets UNLN,UNLN,LN,... M2 gets shifted UNLN,LN,UNLN,.. M3 gets doubleshifted LN,UNLN,UNLN in order top  p1 Make the messages the same length per 3 characters    2 Add further obfuscationp  pThis schema is effective but not efficient.

Negative 32472 pI want to differentiate an expression and generate Fortran for the result. The expression is similar to codeatdiffx2fx,yy2gx,y,y,xycode. The result contains terms such as codeatdifffx,y,y,xy and atdiffgx,y,y,xycode. p  pBefore I generate Fortran I want to remove the atfunctions I have another script to convert the codedifffx,y,ycode and codediffgx,y,ycode entities to subroutine calls. Hence I am trying to write a function that goes through the expression tree and does something special when the atfunction is found. However, if I compare pieceat, this always evaluates to false whereas if I compare piecesin, the sin function is detected correctly.

Negative 32472 pI am trying to find occurrences of a string in another string that has been pulled from the HTML document. The page is an SNMP monitor but we have been having issues in the past with CTRL  F because it only wants to find the string within the current viewport of the browser.

Negative 32472 pWe have created a survey that the response then gets emailed to several email addresses. It is displayed in a table format. When viewing in Mac Mail, all Apple addresses display it perfectly as it should but our personal email accounts i.e. those setup on our own server under a domain with our own email client are showing weird characters throughout the email. Like it just randomly adds   and  all over the place in the middle of words. Being that it seems to only happen under this email address, I believe its something to do with the settings on our server and not the form itself. We have our own virtual dedicated server Plesk. Does anyone know what sort of settings I might be looking for p  pI should also add, that when I view the email via webmail it views just fine. But once brought into Mac Mail it doesnt show everything as it should. Very odd.

Negative 32472 pOn the first place I want to make clear that Im not talking about aspect ratio, Im already using OrthographicCamera with Viewports and them work fine. My problem is about images resolution, what happens is that if I create an image on Photoshop lets assume it is a 128x128 .png and then I put it as a texture in my 128x128 sprite it seems to look fine on my device. Then I try the same screen an another device with a lower resolution and the final effect is quite ugly. On the other hand if I put an image with an higher resolution for instance a 512x512 .png texture in a sprite sized as 128x128 it looks ugly on my highresolution device. So whatever I do on Photoshop Im not able to achieve a nice effect on every device. How can I handle itp
