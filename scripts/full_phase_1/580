Positive 580 pI released a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgmbethkeNetNSCAngClient0.04libNetNSCAngClient.pm relnofollowcodeNetNSCAngClientcodea a while ago and am getting a lot of test failures on OpenBSD. The reason for that is that the NSCAng protocol uses OpenSSL in presharedkey mode RFC4279, something the folks at LibreSSL default on OpenBSD now have ripped out. However, they seem to have been hellbent on doing this the most intransparent way the include files have all the functions defined, just the shared library is missing the corresponding symbols, so compilation works fine but the tests fail.p  pThere is a compatibility package on OpenBSD called eopenssl, and by testing for this first in Makefile.PL using codeExtUtilsPkgConfigcode I can make it work emifem the compatibility library is installed. If it isnt, things still fail.p  pI could check for the CPP symbol OPENSSLNOPSK, but as the includes always come from LibreSSL, this fails even if linking with eopenssl would work fine. The only idea I have left is to try and have a test program run as part of the compilation phase as autoconf does it. Is that even possible with codeExtUtilsMakeMakercode or something else  I wouldnt mind switching the build system if necessaryp

Positive 580 pIm trying to parse some Microsoft logging information.  The logs come as big blobs of supposedly human readable text, examples of which can be seen at the a hrefhttpswww.ultimatewindowssecurity.comsecuritylogencyclopediaevent.aspxeventID4663 relnofollowWindows Security Bloga, and there is a specific event that I want to exclude from my analysis, namely An operation was performed on an object when the object in question is a groupPolicyContainer.p  pHeres my regular expression and test codep  precodemy re  qrmsEventCode4662[d].Object TypesgroupPolicyContainerS if sample1  re  print Matches  should not haven  if sample2  re  print Matches  and should haven  codepre  pcodesample1code contains the phrase codeObject Type groupPolicyContainercode and codesample2code contains the phrase codeObject Type Keycode. They both have the same EventCode this is a contrived test case.  If you look at the link, you can see that theres a lot of text surrounding the two key phrases, EventCode and Object Type.  Object Type does not occur more than once per log entry in my contrived test case.p  pThe regular expression says both match.

Positive 580 precodeUse of uninitialized value encoding in string eq at     varwwwmailingtoolperlMaillingToolDeploy.pm line 190 1     W uninitialized An undefined value was used as if it were already     defined.  It was interpreted as a  or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.     To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.      To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you the     name of the variable if any that was undefined. In some cases it cannot     do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the undefined value     in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program and the operation     displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear literally in your     program.  For example, that foo is usually optimized into that      . foo, and the warning will refer to the concatenation . operator,     even though there is no . in your program.  Use of uninitialized value in concatenation . or string at     varwwwmailingtoolperlMaillingToolDeploy.pm line 622 1  print on closed filehandle FILE at     varwwwmailingtoolperlMaillingToolPmtaPmtaFileMaker.pm line 127 2     W closed The filehandle youre printing on got itself closed sometime     before now.

Negative 580 pHI All,p  pWe have a .Net 2.0 application which has a MySQL backend. We want to be able to deploy MySQl and the DB when we install the application and im trying to find the best solution.  The current setup is to copy the required files to a folder on the local machine and then perform a NET START commands to install and start the mysql service.  Then we restore a backup of the DB to this newly created mysql instance using bat files.  Its not an ideal solution at all and im trying to come up with something more robust.  p  pThe issues are User rights on Vista, and all sorts of small things around installing and starting the service.  Its far too fragile to be reliable or at least it appears that way when i am testing it.  This is a ClientServer type setup so we only need to install one Server per office but i want to make sure its as hassle free as possible and with as few screens as possible.p  pHow would you do itp

Negative 580 pI have applied a codeFormattercode to a codeJFormattedTextFieldcode using a codeFormatterFactorycode, when a user clicks into the text field I want to select the contents. p  pA focus listener does not work as expected because the formatter gets called, which eventually causes the value to be reset which ultimately deselects the fields contents.

Negative 580 ul liHow have you setup one or more worker scripts for queueoriented systemsli liHow do you arrange to startup  and restart if necessary  worker scripts as required Im thinking about such tools as init.d, Rubybased god, DJBs Daemontools, etc, etcli ul  pIm developing an asynchronous queueworker system, in this case using PHP amp a hrefhttpxph.ussoftwarebeanstalkdBeanstalkdDa though the actual language and daemon isnt important. The tasks themselves are not too hard  encoding an array with the commands and parameters into JSON for transport through the Beanstalkd daemon, picking them up in a worker script to action them as required.p  pThere are a number of other similar queueworker setups out there, such as a hrefhttprubyforge.orgprojectsstarlingStarlinga, a hrefhttpwww.danga.comgearmanGearmana, a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comsqsAmazons SQSa and other more enterprise oriented systems like IBMs MQ and RabbitMQ. If you run something like Gearman, or SQS  how do emyouem start and control the worker pool  The questions is on the initial worker startup, and then being able to add additional extra workers, shutting them down at will though I can send a message through the queue to shut them down  as long as some watcher wont automatically restart them. This is not a PHP problem, its about straight Unix processes of setting up one or more processes to run on startup, or adding more workers to the pool.p  pA a hrefhttppastebin.ca1331063bash script to loop a script a is already in place  this calls the PHP script which then collects and runs tasks from the queue, occasionally exiting to be able to clean itself up it can also pause a few seconds on failure, or via a planned event.  This works fine, and building the worker processes on top of that wont be very hard at all.p  pGetting a good worker controller system is about flexibility, starting one or two automatically on a machine start, and being able to add a couple more from the command line when the queue is busy, shutting down the extras when no longer required.p

I gained some information from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1146218newtotddaretheresampleapplicationswithteststoshowhowtodotddhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1146218newtotddaretheresampleapplicationswithteststoshowhowtodotdda but have some specific questions which Id like answers todiscussion on. p  ol liKent Beck uses a list which he adds to and strikes out from to guide the development process. How do you make such a list I initially had a few items like server should start up, server should abort if channel is not available etc. but they got mixed and finally now, its just something like client should be able to connect to server which subsumed server startup etc..li liHow do you handle rewrites I initially selected a half duplex system based on named pipes so that I could develop the application logic on my own machine and then later add the USB communication part. It them moved to become a socket based thing and then moved from using raw sockets to using the Python SocketServer module. Each time things changed, I found that I had to rewrite considerable parts of the tests which was annoying. Id figured that the tests would be a somewhat invariable guide during my development. They just felt like more code to handle. li liI needed a client and a server to communicate through the channel to test either side. I could mock one of the sides to test the other but then the whole channel wouldnt be tested and I worry that Id miss that. This detracted from the whole redgreenrefactor rhythm. Is this just lack of experience or am I doing something wrongli liThe Fake it till you make it left me with a lot of messy code that I later spent a lot of time to refactor and clean up. Is this the way things workli liAt the end of the session, I now have my client and server running with around 3 or 4 unit tests. It took me around a week to do it. I think I could have done it in a day if I were using the unit tests after code way. I fail to see the gain. li ol  pIm looking for comments and advice from people who have implemented large non trivial projects completely or almost completely using this methodology. It makes sense to me to follow the way emafterem I have something already running and want to add a new feature but doing it from scratch seems to tiresome and not worth the effort. p  pemP.S.

A string that holds the make of the car.     speed. An int that holds the cars current speed.  In addition, the class should have the following member functions.      Constructor.  The constructor should accept the cars year and make          as arguments and assign these values to the objects year and          make member variables.  The constructor should initialize the          speed member variable to 0.      Accessors.  Appropriate accessor functions should be created to allow          values to be retrieved from an objects year, make, and speed          member variables.      accelerate.  The accelerate function should add 5 to the speed member          variable each time it is called.      brake.  The brake function should subtract 5 from the speed member          variable each time it is called.  Demonstrate the class in a program that creates a Car object, and then      calls the accelerate function five times.  After each call to the      accelerate function, get the current speed of the car and display      it.  Then, call the brake function five times.

Negative 580 pWe have some JavaScript that writes a script include to a dynamic resource in our web page in order to allow us to communicate some information between pages served from different servers that are subject to cross site scripting restrictions.p  pThe idea is that the browser requests the JavaScript file which is served by a dynamic resource on the server side which also puts some server side information into the Request.  The JavaScript file is then executed by the browser when it is added to the page.p  pWeve run into an issue with Internet Explorer where the JavaScript returned in the response is intermittently not executed when it is added to the page.

Negative 580 pI want port some my Python scripts into web apps so that others can use it and Ill use some sort of web framework. Ive been playing around with Django lately but it doesnt have the basic user registration, email verification stuff built in and one would probably end up using codedjangoregistrationcode. Almost all web applications require you to create an account, verify your account by clicking that verification link in your account and so on. One would save a lot of time if he could just skip past the part of setting up authentication, verification, the usual login and logout pages and get to part of doing the core part. Has anyone come across a preconfigured Python webframework Django would be nice that does the all usual basic stuff Django has that codecontrib.authcode bit you can add codedjangoregistrationcode p  pI hope this question sounds reasonable.p  pThanks.p

Negative 580 pCan you help me play Robot Unicorn Attack on my Android phonep  pI downloaded the .swf file, put it on my phone and there is this app called SWF Player that can open SWF files from the SDCard. But, since I dont have a hardware keyboard, I cant play the game because I have no chance pressing X or Z I heard even with a hardware keyboard youre not able to do this though....p  pNo my idea is to write an App that offers an Overlay where you have a custom Gamepad that you can assign key events which are then dispatched to the SWF file. p  pBut how to hell do I do this I figured you probably need to use Air for Android...But I have not used it before and a short Google search could not show me how you could pass key events from Air to an SWF file. Any ideasp

Negative 580 pGosh, this is so weird, I dont know what to say.  The short version is that I have a simulator app which I spawn from my application when the user asks me to.

Negative 580 pive written a daemon in php and want to make sure it doesnt leak memory, as itll be running 247.p  peven in its simplest form memorygetpeakusage for a daemon will report that the script consumes more memory for each cycle. memorygetusage on the other hand will not grow.p  pthe question is should i worry ive stripped down the daemon to the bare basics but this is still happening. any thoughtsp  precodeusrbinphp q  ltphp requireonce SystemDaemon.php SystemDaemonsetOptionappName, smsd SystemDaemonstart whileSystemDaemonisDying  SystemDaemoninfodebug memorygetpeakusage .memorygetpeakusage  SystemDaemoninfodebug memorygetusage .memorygetusage  SystemDaemoniterate2  codepre  pFINAL NOTE  CONCLUSION i ended up writing my own daemon wrapper, not using pears systemdaemon. regardless of how i tweaked this library i could not stop it from leaking memory. hope this helps someone else.p  pFINAL NOTE  CONCLUSION 2 my script has been in production for over a week and is still not leaking 1 bytes of memory. so  writing a daemon in php actually seems to be ok, as long as youre very careful about its memory consumtion.p

Negative 580 pI have a list of integers, for example code1,2,2,3,4,1code.  I need to be able to check for equivalence  between different lists.p  pHowever, I do not mean a simple number wise comparison.  Each of these lists actually denotes a set partition, where the position in the list denotes the index of an element and the number denotes an index of the group. For example in the former, element 0 and element 5 are in the same group, element 1 and 2 are in the same group and element 3 and 4 are both in their own individual groups.  strongThe actual index of the group is not important, only the grouping.strongp  pI need to be able to test equivalence in this sense, so for example the previous list would be equivalent to code5,3,3,2,9,5,code since they have the same grouping.p  pThe way I have been doing this is reducing the array to a kind of normal form.  I find all numbers having the same value as the first number, and set these all to 0. I then continue in the list until I find a new number, find all numbers of the same value is this and set them all to 1.  I continue in this manner.p  pIn my example, both numbers would reduce to would reduce down to code0,1,1,2,3,0code and of course I can then just use a simple comparison to see if they are equivalent.p  pHowever this is quite slow, as I have to make several linear passes over the list.  So to cut to the chase, strongis there any more efficient manner of reducing these numbers to this normal formstrongp  pHowver, more generally, strongcan I avoid this reduction all together and compare arrays in a different and perhaps more efficient mannerstrongp  pstrongImplementation detailsstrongp  ul liThese arrays are actually implemented as bitsets to save space, so I really do have to iterate over the whole list every time as there is no rbtree esque hashing going on.li liLarge numbers of these arrays will be stored in an stl unorderedset, hence the requirement for a hash should be taken into considerationli ul

Negative 580 pI am trying to spread out data that is received in bursts. This means I have data that is received by some other application in large bursts. For each data entry I need to do some additional requests on some server, at which I should limit the traffic. Hence I try to spread up the requests in the time that I have until the next data burst arrives.p  pCurrently I am using a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTokenbucket relnofollowtokenbucketa to spread out the data. However because the data I receive is already badly shaped I am still either filling up the queue of pending request, or I get spikes whenever a bursts comes in. So this algorithm does not seem to do the kind of shaping I need.p  pWhat other algorithms are there available to limit the requests I know I have times of high load and times of low load, so both should be handled well by the application.p  pI am not sure if I was really able to explain the problem I am currently having. If you need any clarifications, just let me know.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIll try to clarify the problem some more and explain, why a simple rate limiter does not work.p  pThe problem lies in the bursty nature of the traffic and the fact, that burst have a different size at different times. What is mostly constant is the delay between each burst. Thus we get a bunch of data records for processing and we need to spread them out as evenly as possible before the next bunch comes in. However we are not 100 sure when the next bunch will come in, just aproximately, so a simple codedivide time by number of recordscode does not work as it should.p  pA rate limiting does not work, because the spread of the data is not sufficient this way. If we are close to saturation of the rate, everything is fine, and we spread out evenly although this should not happen to frequently. If we are below the threshold, the spreading gets much worse though.p  pIll make an example to make this problem more clearp  pLets say we limit our traffic to 10 requests per seconds and new data comes in about every 10 seconds.p  pWhen we get 100 records at the beginning of a time frame, we will query 10 records each second and we have a perfect even spread. However if we get only 15 records well have one second where we query 10 records, one second where we query 5 records and 8 seconds where we query 0 records, so we have very unequal levels of traffic over time. Instead it would be better if we just queried 1.5 records each second. However setting this rate would also make problems, since new data might arrive earlier, so we do not have the full 10 seconds and 1.5 queries would not be enough. If we use a token bucket, the problem actually gets even worse, because tokenbuckets allow bursts to get through at the beginning of the timeframe.p  pHowever this example over simplifies, because actually we cannot fully tell the number of pending requests at any given moment, but just an upper limit. So we would have to throttle each time based on this number.p

Negative 580 pI recently began developing a little javascript game, just for fun.  The idea was that you controlled a little dot with the arrow keys or awsd or i dont care what within a box on the screen.  Little rectangles would then randomly spawn on all edges of the box and progress across it.  you have to avoid contact with them.

Negative 580 pIm trying to graph two types of plots in the same window i.e. a line plot, and a scatter plot. The data being plotted in the line graph first plot are floating numerical values representing climate indices Y vs. decimal years X. The second plot that  I would like to be a scattered is much the same, but with floating numerical values representing stream flows Y vs. decimal years X. Ive tried to accomplish this as follows by using a twin x axis and a second, parasite y axis for the scatter plot p  precode    import mpltoolkits     from mpltoolkits.axesgrid1 import hostsubplot     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      host  hostsubplot111     par  host.twinx      host.setxlim1880, 2020     host.setylim5, 10      host.setxlabelTime     host.setylabelPDSI Region 01     par.setylabelMinimum 10 Annual 7day Nonexceedance Flow cfs      x1  timearray     y1  pdsiarray01     x2  upAmmyr     y2  upAmmmin      p1,  host.plotx1, y1, labelPDSI01     p2,  par.scatterx2, y2, labelAnnual Lowflow Upper Amm      par.setylim30, 60      host.legend     host.axis[left].label.setcolorp1.getcolor     par.axis[right].label.setcolorp2.getcolor      plt.draw     plt.show codepre  pand I get the error codep  precode    TypeError cannot perform reduce with flexible type codepre  pThis code works fine when I replace scatter with plot in the line that starts with p2, but produces a second line plot. The ultimate reason I want it scattered is that there are many fewer points to be plotted in the second dataset, and the lines connecting them are distracting and messy when I all need is to highlight an instant in time. A bar plot instead of a scatter would work too. Any suggestions or help would be much appreciatedp

Negative 580 pI noticed that the Smalltalk language has no concept of privateprotected methods. All methods are public. Coming from a JavaC background, Ive thought of this as a fundamental weakness in the language as any application created in Smalltalk would be completely open to manipulation. I guess you could rely on naming conventions to document the public API and prefix methods to indicate them as private I believe Squeak does this, but its still completely open.p  pAre there any benefits to this approach over having explicit access modifiers to control  access to method invocationsp
Negative 580 pWe have a database, tstERP.  tstERP has RCSI enabled and that was verified viap  pSELECT isreadcommittedsnapshoton, name from sys.databases WHERE name  TESTp  pThere are two connections.

Negative 580 pToday Ive run across a rather strange error. Essentially what is happening is inside the function codefoocode the first parameter is being set to the pointer value of the pointer codecrosssegmentscode. So say codecrosssegmentscode is location at 0x0045 then codeiMeaninglessdatacode will be set at 0x0045. If I take out codeiMeaninglessDatacode and simply have codeo1code as the first parameter than codeo1code will be equal to 0x0045.

Negative 580 pIve been scratching my head around developing a simple plugin based architecture on top of Spring, for one of my current apps. No matter how much separation one could achieve using patterns like MVC, one always reaches a point where coupling is inevitable. p  pThus, I started weighing options. At first I thought that filters are a good one. Every plugin  Id make would be a filter, which then I will simply insert into the filter map. Of course, this will create a bit of overhead when enumerating and checking all the filters, but at least , controllers wont have to care what has happened to the data before it reached them, or what happens afterwards, they will just care to fetch the models through DAO or whatnot and return them. p  pThe problem with this is that not all of my app requests are HTTPbased. Some are based on emails, others are internally scheduled timed, so Filters wont help much, unless I try to adapt every type of incoming request to HTTPRequest, which would be too much.p  pAnother one I thought about was annotation based AOP, where I annotate every method, where the plugin would intercept methods based on certain conventions. My problem with is that first I am not so experienced with AOP in general, and second, simply writing all those conventions already suggests a bit of couplingp  pBy far the option that mostly appeals to my way of thinking is using Springbased events. Every type of request handler within my app web controller, email handler, etc will be a sort of an event dispatcher, which will dispatch Spring events on every major action. On the other hand, plugins will simply listen for when a particular event happens, and do some logic. This will allow me to utilize point 1 as well, as some of those plugins could be filters as well, i.e when they receive a notification that a certain controller action is done, they may just decide to do nothing, and rather wait for when they get called by the filter chain. I see this as a somewhat nice approach. Of course here comes the overhead again, of dispatching events, plus the fact that every involved class will eb coupled with Spring forever, but I see this as a necessary evil.p  pMy main concern regarding Spring events is performance, both in terms of latency, and memory footprint.p  pI am still not an expert, so a bunch of feedback here would be of tremendous help. Are spring   events the best for this type of architecture, or there is another solution that Ive missed I am aware that there might even be some thirdparty solutions out there already, so  Id be glad if someone could point out one or two tried and proven ones.p  pThanks.p

Negative 580 pIm inheriting some code here from another developer and Im trying to solve a file permissions issue. Essentially when files are uploaded from the custom admin panel, they are given the wildly odd 363 permission level opposed to say a 755 or 644.

What Im trying to do is change the file permissions after it is uploaded. It shows success but when I check the file through FTP, its still 363.

Now, Im kind of new to generic types so Ill explain my understanding of what this does and that might help you in figuring out whats wrong with my thinking. p  pE extends Comparable So basically an object E that is an extension of Comparable. Comparable having an element that is an ancestor of E, which essentially is an abstract way of saying E can be compared with its other elements using the Comparable interface. p  pThen in my static method Im trying to pass the BSTNode recursively. I cant seem to wrap my head around why its not working. I know If I pass codeBSTNodeltgtcode it works fine, but that seems dangerous. If someone could explain to me WHY this isnt working I could try and find another solution.p

Negative 580 pI am uploading videos to YouTube using Googles GData API Java reference implementation httpscode.google.compgdatajavaclient.

I have searched the web and read the Google API docs, but so far have found nothing to indicate that I am doing something stupid which of course could still be the case, mind. Any ideas on how to get YouTube to honor their own APIp

Negative 580 pI just stumbled upon a behavior of the codeDataGridcode in WPF and frankly I dont know if I did something wrong or its the standard behavior of the WPF codeDataGridcode.p  pSo I have an interface, lets call it IItem. IItem has couple of properties Name, Active, Timestamp. This interface inherits from an other interface lets call it IBaseItem. IBaseItem also has properties Id, Selected, Active, Timestamp. So I would expect when I create a codeDataGridcode in XAML with codeAutoGenerateColumnstruecode and the binding source is a codeListampltIItemampgtcode then It would generate the Id and the Selected columns as well. p  pInstead it only generates the Name, Active and Timestamp properties as columns. And the Name is not editable although it has a setter property but Active is.p  precodepublic interface IBaseItem  INotifyPropertyChanged      bool Selected  get set      int Id  get      bool Active  get set              DateTime Timestamp  get set   public interface IItem IBaseItem, IEditableObject      string Name  get set      new bool Active  get set      new DateTime Timestamp  get   codepre  pBut if I break the inheritance chain and make the IItem as an individual interface then voila the Name become editable.p  pI dont get why the inheritance is messing things up. Can anyone enlighten mep

Negative 580 pI have an odd situation with a webapp that keeps running down memory on Firefox  Windows. Basically the app refreshes the data in the page using a strongPOSTstrong call to the server made via codejQuerycode. Every time the call is made, Firefoxs memory consumption increases in an amount thats disproportional to the size of the data returned from the server. p  pTo see if this was specific to my app, I wrote a simple test app using Sinatra Ruby 1.9.2p318 and jQuery 1.7.1.

Despite the fact that the new data replaces the old one in the page, it seems Firefox isnt disposing of that allocated space in memory. Turns out this runs down the memory completely if the page is left open overnight on simple, 4GB machines.p  pIs this a javascript issue or something with Firefox Can I somehow force garbage collection in either thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong This memory issue wasnt observed with Google Chrome 13.0.782.112 on Win7.p

Negative 580 pThis is probably a stupid question but I can not seem to either remember how to stop the program from doing this or I never learned it.p  pIm creating a blackjack game which draws random cards with the paintComponent.  When the hit button is clicked, I want it to draw the next card and generate the new total.  However, whenever I click the hit button, it draws the new card perfect, but it then creates all new cards on top of my already drawn cards.p  pHow do I stop the repaint method from picking new random cards and keep them the same throughout the program  I should mention, all the cards are stored in an array and are called to with a random number generator.  Also, this happens when I resize the java window.p  pIf asked, I will post the code but I feel like this has a simple solution.p

Negative 580 pstrongDISCLAIMERstrong This is NOT a question about understanding the difference between codeabstract classcodees and codeinterfacecodes. If you didnt get that, please read the title again. I am wellversed in the difference between a contract and a halfimplemented subsystem.p  pLets take Java as just one example. It seems that there is little need for a distinct keyword codeinterfacecode, when from my point of view as a developer, the compiler spits out exactly the same thing, which in humanspeak is, You cannot utilise this until you derive via codeimplementscode or codeextendscode a new class which implements its methods. Simple.p  pBut there is one scenario which may prevent conflation of these two When we need to codeimplementcode more than one codeinterfacecode, since Java does not allow multiple inheritance for codeclasscodees. Surely it would be trivial to build the language in such a way that the compiler recognises when there are any method bodies or declared variables, and subsequently disallows multicodeimplementscodecodeextendscode where appropriate Does order of precedence then present a problemp  pIs this the only reason we have this syntactic differentiationp  pP.S. One reason I ask this question is that this scenario can present quite a challenge in understanding for new OO programmers, and I think that handling this in a more streamlined fashion, at the language level, would greatly assist in more quickly grasping the conceptual differences.p

Negative 580 pI am migrating an app written on asp.net 1.1. There is a process which can take 5 minutes on one page, processing data in SQL, and letting the user know when its complete. p  pTo get around the HTTP page timeout, the process runs asynchronously and the page refreshes every 5 seconds checking for completion. Its very simple. Here is the problem I use a session variable as a semaphore to signal process completion. p  pThis is not working now as I cannot read the semaphore set in the asynch process. The asynch process can read the session from the calling routine, but cannot write back. p  pFirst, is there a way to get the asynch process to write to a session variable which can be read by another process This probably is not the best approach today, but getting the app working is my biggest priority. p  pSecond, if I rewrite it, what approach should be used This is an asp web app. Not MVC.p

When the user clicks on a level, I use mylocalDataRef.getitem, to retrieve the full object and send that off to the activity.p  pWhen debugging, mylocalDataRef is not null, i.e. it doesnt crash when calling the get method, however I cannot see its value as if it was null, and the return result from get is always null.p  pCan anyone shed light on what is happening.p  pp.s. showLevels is called in onOptionsItemSelected, that is when a user clicks on a menu button on the action bar. p  precode   private void showLevels             final ArrayListltLevelgt mylocalDataRef  levels         String[] simpleLevels  new String[mylocalDataRef.size]         forint i  0 i lt mylocalDataRef.size i                      simpleLevels[i]  mylocalDataRef.geti.getName                   AlertDialog.Builder builder  new AlertDialog.Builderthis         builder.setTitlePick a level         builder.setItemsmylocalDataRef, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                      public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int item                              Intent i  new IntentgetBaseContext, LevelActivity.class                 i.setActionIntent.ACTIONVIEW                 i.putExtraresult, mylocalDataRef .getitem.getId                 i.putExtralevelname, mylocalDataRef .getitem.getName                 i.putExtratype, level                 startActivityi                               AlertDialog alert  builder.create         alert.show      codepre

Negative 580 pClosely related to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5455635howtousehttpclientwithmultithreadedoperationHow to use HttpClient with multithreaded operationa, Im wondering if apache HttpAsyncClient is thread safe, or if it, too, requires the use of a MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager, or a ThreadSafeClientConnManager.p  pIf it does require such a connection manager, does one exist in the async librariesp  pI was able to find a PoolingClientAsyncConnectionManager in the async libraries, but Im not sure if thats what I need.p  pAlternately, I was thinking of using ThreadLocal to create one HttpAsyncClient object per thread.p  pNote that unlike the question I referenced earlier, I need state to be emindependentem across sessions, even if multiple sessions hit the same domain. If a cookie is set in session 1, the cookie should strongnotstrong be visible to session 2. For this reason, Ive also considered creating a brand new HttpAsyncClient object for every single request, though I get the impression there should be a better way.p  pThanks.p

Negative 580 pOkay, so I have these two tables in MySQL. One is called History and one is called Annotated. p  pThe History table is full of random YouTube video ids that can be repeated.

Negative 580 pI was asked to do some PHP scripts on MySQL DB to show some data when I noticed the strange design they had. They want to perform a study that would require collecting up to 2000 records per user and they are automatically creating a new table for each user that registers. Its a pilot study at this stage so they have around 30 tables but they should have 3000 users for the real study.p  pI wanted to suggest gathering all of them in a single table but since there might be around 1500 INSERTs per minute to that database during the study period, I wanted to ask this question here first. Will that cause table locks in MySQL So, Is it one table with 1500 INSERTs per minute and a maximum size of 6,000,000 records or 3000 tables with 30 INSERTs per minute and a maximum size of 2000 records. I would like to suggest the first option but I want to be sure that it will not cause any issues. I read that InnoDB has rowlevel locks. So, will that have a better performance combined with the one table optionp

Negative 580 pI have a collection of codestdsetcode. I want to find the intersection of all the sets in this collection, in the fastest manner. The number of sets in the collection is typically very small 510, and the number of elements in each set is is usually less than 1000, but can occasionally go upto around 10000. But I need to do these intersections tens of thousands of time, as fast as possible. I tried to benchmark a few methods as followsp  ol liInplace intersection in a codestdsetcode object which initially copies the first set. Then for subsequent sets, it iterates over all element of itself and the ith set of the collection, and removes items from itself as needed.li liUsing codestdsetintersectioncode into a temporary codestdsetcode, swap contents to a current set, then again find intersection of the current set with the next set and insert into the temp set, and so on.li liManually iterate over all the elements of all sets like in 1, but using a codevectorcode as the destination container instead of codestdsetcode.li liSame as in 4, but using a codestdlistcode instead of a codevectorcode, suspecting a codelistcode will provide faster deletions from the middle.li liUsing hash sets codestdunorderedsetcode and checking for all items in all sets.li ol  pAs it turned out, using a codevectorcode is marginally faster when the number of elements in each set is small, and codelistcode is marginally faster for larger sets. Inplace using codesetcode is a substantially slower than both, followed by codesetintersectioncode and hash sets. Is there a faster algorithmdatastructuretricks to achieve this I can post code snippets if required. Thanks p

If the thumbnails are setup to display a lightbox instead, then no lightbox pops up when the thumbnails are clicked.p  pI can only assume that I have missed some vital step, such as including a JavaScript declaration at the top of my template.

Negative 580 pI am trying to understand some concept here regarding delegate and callbacks. Basically I am trying to make an httprequest, which is based on zipcode. So prior making httprequest, I call a locationmanager and grab a zipcode, however, in such duration, I have to wait async to complete that task, and get the feedback. The concern here is, the delegate I have set from locationmanager, have no link with httprequest class. So, I am trying to understand how can I pass the information back from delegate to httprequest. I was looking into blocks, but again is there anyway in blocks that you can wait for a response of a delegate or it can be also set as a BOOL property in async task, when completed can trigger the request. I havent tried blocks much except for GCD, so still trying to get my heads around this.p  pI welcome any suggestions here.p

Negative 580 pIm having an issue with sets and how transforms are applied.

Say I have a circle and a set, on which I want to apply a transform.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodecircle  paper.circle0,0.5 set  paper.set codepre  pIf I add the circle first, and then transform, it works.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodeset.push circle set.transforms100,100 codepre  pTo make a 50 radius circle. If I reverse the order, however,p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodeset.transforms100,100 set.push circle codepre  pThe transform is not applied.p  pThis seems as though it will break many, many rendering and animation type algorithms, where your groupstransforms hold your articulation state, and you add or remove objects to them instead of recreating the entire transform every time. Is there an option somewhere in the documentation that I am not seeing that addresses this, or was this functionality discarded in favor of simplicity It seems very odd to be missing, given that it is supported directly and easily in the group hierarchy of SVG itself... do I need to emmanuallyem apply the transform from the set to any children added after the set is transformedp

Negative 580 pI need my iOS app to keep getting users location updates when app going to background. As I found in Apples documentation, tracking the users location is one of the longrunning background tasks that are allowed to be implemented, but I also need to make network calls to send to server some locationbased info when user is at certain places. That is not listed as an allowed longrunning background, and as for finitelength tasks in background, it seems to just provide a way to finish a task that was in progress when entering background mode. Is it possible to make remote services calls when app is running in background As I said before, I need to send information depending on the current users location, how could I manage thisp  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong Im not able to find many complete examples about backgrounding, so Im not sure if what Im trying to do is validp  precode voidapplicationDidEnterBackgroundUIApplication application       Check if multitasking is supported     UIDevice device  [UIDevice currentDevice]     BOOL backgroundSupported  NO     if [device respondsToSelectorselectorisMultitaskingSupported]         backgroundSupported  device.multitaskingSupported      if backgroundSupported          bgTask  [application beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler             [application endBackgroundTaskbgTask]             bgTask  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid         ]           Want to perform some data request here          dispatchasync required          if bgTask  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid              [application endBackgroundTaskbgTask]             bgTask  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid                    Location manager          should be inside bgTask Completion of previous tasks needed at this point         locationManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]         if [CLLocationManager locationServicesEnabled]             locationManager.delegate  self            locationManager.distanceFilter  3            locationManager.desiredAccuracy  kCLLocationAccuracyBest                 [locationManager startUpdatingLocation]                     voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didUpdateToLocationCLLocation newLocation fromLocationCLLocation oldLocation      bgTask  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endBackgroundTaskbgTask]        bgTask  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid     ]       Want to perform some data processing here, including several network calls      to get and send data to server     [self checkResult]    voidcheckResult       Some more data processing and several network calls to send data to server      if bgTask  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid         [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endBackgroundTaskbgTask]        bgTask  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid       codepre  pAny helpp

Negative 580 pI often use C to work with large datasets, which take the form of very large lists of strings, or large 2 or 3 dimensional arrays of numbers. The latter especially is very easy to visualize in Matlab, a functionality I often miss with C.p  pVS2012 has very nice debugging functions which allow you to stop execution and inspect different variables in various ways. It will also highlight variables that change with red.p  pUnfortunately, for lists and matrices this is useless. By default, lists will not be expanded, and if you do expand them the values of individual entries will not be visible unless you expand every single one individually. The layout is uneconomical with space, so you can see few entries at one time. With larger 2D arrays, the way the entries are arranged makes interpreting the array at a glance a nightmare.p  pFor datasets, there is a great visualization tool that automatically shows up when you click the magnifying glass in debug mode. Unfortunately, I cant find anything similar to it for lists of strings, string arrays, or 2D arrays of numbers.p  pIs there an extension or hidden feature for viewing such data structures when execution is paused If no, how can I make my ownp

Negative 580 pI know that InfiniteScroll and Masonry work well together. But I am using the Infinite Scroll Extension of Yii called yiinfinitescroll and tried to apply Masonry on it. Infinite Scroll for itself works perfectly, Masonry for itself too. But after InfiniteScroll tries to load a new set of images Ive got an image page, the callback part of InfiniteScroll doesnt seem to fire, because the newly appended elements dont have any masonry code in it and appear behind the first visible items. I know that this bug is reported often, but the solutions I found so far didnt work for me.p  pMy structure for showing the picture looks like thisp  precodeltdiv classitemsgt  ltdiv classpicgt...ltpicgt  ltdiv classpicgt...ltpicgt ... ltdivgt codepre  pThe first page load looks like thisp  precodeltdiv classitems masonry style...gt    ltdiv classpic masonrybrick ...gtltdivgt    ltdiv classpic masonrybrick ...gtltdivgt    ... ltdivgt  everythings fine, masonry is injected into the code codepre  pAfter infinite scroll dynamically loads new images these look like thisp  precodeltdiv classitems masonry ...gtltdivgt    ltdiv classpic masonrybrick ...gtltdivgt    ...     appended pics    ltdiv classpicgtltdivgt    ltdiv classpicgtltdivgt ltdivgt  so no masonry functionality was applied codepre  pMy Masonry Codep  precode    function            var container  .items         container.imagesLoadedfunction           container.masonry             itemSelector .pic,             columnWidth 405                         container.infinitescroll          normally, the options are found here. but as I use infinitescroll as a Yii extension, the plugin is already initiated with options              ,      trigger Masonry as a callback     function newElements          hide new items while they are loading       var newElems   newElements .css opacity 0         ensure that images load before adding to masonry layout       newElems.imagesLoadedfunction          show elems now theyre ready         newElems.animate opacity 1          container.masonry appended, newElems, true                  codepre  pI also tried to copy and replace the current InfiniteScrollmin.js file in the extension folder by the newest one.

Negative 580 pIm trying to create a responsive layout in bootstrap that has a fullheight sidebar. I got the responsive part working, but the only problem is  the spacing of the spans dont seem to be playing well together.p  pOn the right side  the main content  it doesnt span to fit the rest of the screen. Also, when the browser gets too small  the main content actually gets partially hidden by the sidebar.p  pAm I doing something wrong with the spans If I remove the codeposition absolutecode from the code.sidebarcode, then the whole code.content.code piece slides underneath the sidebar  but the sidebar is no longer full height, and the content still doesnt fill the rest of the screen evenly. It seems as its impossible to get this working correctly, but I want to use bootstrap for the convenience of not having to redo all the CSSJS thats integrated.p  pExample img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0lIRs.png altSpans not filling screen img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNHjmx.png altSpan partially hiddenp  pCSSp  precodehtml      height 100   .sidebar      background 333     margin 0     padding 3em 2em     height 100     mozboxshadow 0 0 5px 888     webkitboxshadow 0 0 5px888     boxshadow 0 0 5px 888     minheight 100     position absolute   .sidebar .logo  marginbottom 3em   .content      margin 5em  codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltbodygt     ltdiv classrowgt         lt Navigation for small screens gt         ltdiv classnavbar navbarinverse hiddendesktopgt             ltdiv classnavbarinnergt                 lta classbrand hrefgtHome Linkltagt                 ltul classnavgt                     ltligtlta hrefgtProjectsltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtPhotographyltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtContactltagtltligt                 ltulgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt          lt Navigation for larger screens gt         ltdiv classspan3 hiddenphone hiddentabletgt             ltdiv classspan3 sidebargt                 ltdiv classlogogtlta classlogotitle hrefgtHome Linkltagtltdivgt                  ltul classnav navpills navstackedgt                     ltligtlta hrefgtProjectsltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtPhotographyltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtContactltagtltligt                 ltulgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classspan9 contentgt  ltdiv classspan5gt     ltdiv classpageheadergt         lth1gtHello. ltsmallgtThis is.ltsmallgtlth1gt     ltdivgt     ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

So here goes again.p  pI have a class that contains a list of constants that will never change in a file called Common.cs and these constants need to be referenced in other files like a Weapons.cs file.  The problem Im running into is that I am always getting an error stating that the constvariable does not exist in the current context.  Im not sure what Im doing wrong or missing but Im sure its something simple.  Here is an example of my code so farp  pheres the class with the constants in itp  precodenamespace MechLab      public static class Common              public const int NUMBEROFEQUIPABLESECTIONS  6         public const int NUMBEROFCRITICALSECTIONS  8         public const int NUMBEROFSECTIONS  11         public const int UNKNOWNLOCATION  1         public const int RIGHTARM  0         public const int LEFTARM  1         public const int RIGHTTORSO  2         public const int LEFTTORSO  3         public const int CENTERTORSO  4         public const int HEAD  5         public const int RIGHTLEG  6         public const int LEFTLEG  7         public const int RIGHTREARTORSO  8         public const int LEFTREARTORSO  9         public const int CENTERREARTORSO  10         public const int BOTHSIDETORSOS  11         public const int BOTHARMS  12          public const int NUMBEROFHARDPOINTTYPES  4         public const int BALLISTIC  0         public const int ENERGY  1         public const int MISSILE  2         public const int AMS  3         public const int OMNI  4          public const int AMMO  3         public const int OTHER  4         public const int SELECTED  5          public const double SRMDAMAGE  2.5         public const double LRMDAMAGE  1.8         public const double SRMRECYCLE  3.5         public const double LRMRECYCLE  3.25         public const double SRMDELAY  0.25         public const double LRMDELAY  0.5         public const double LRMIMPULSE  0.8         public const int SRMRANGE  270         public const int MRMRANGE  450         public const int LRMMINRANGE  180         public const int ENHANCEDLRMMINRANGE  90         public const int LRMRANGE  630         public const int LRMMAXRANGE  1000         public const int EXTENDEDLRMMINRANGE  300         public const int EXTENDEDLRMRANGE  1140         public const int EXTENDEDLRMMAXRANGE  1140         public const int SRMSPEED  300         public const int STREAKSRMSPEED  200         public const int LRMSPEED  100          public const int ARTEMISCRITICALS  1         public const int ARTEMISCOST  1         public const double ARTEMISTONNAGE  1.0          public const int LASERRANGEMOD  2         public const int PROJECTILERANGEMOD  3          public const int INTERNALS  0         public const int ARMOR  1         public const int INTERNALSTOTAL  8         public const int ARMORTOTAL  8          public const int NUMBEROFMAINSECTION  6         public const int NUMBEROFLESSERSECTION  3         public const int NUMBEROFMAINSECTIONCRITICALS  12         public const int NUMBEROFLESSERSECTIONCRITICALS  6          public const int BALLISTICMAXRANGEMOD  3         public const int ENERGYMAXRANGEMOD  2          public const int LOWERARMACTUATOR  0         public const int HANDACTUATOR  1          public const int UNKNOWNITEMTYPE  0         public const int COMPONENTITEMTYPE  1         public const int WEAPONITEMTYPE  2         public const int AMMOITEMTYPE  3         public const int EQUIPMENTITEMTYPE  4         public const int HEATSINKITEMTYPE  5         public const int JUMPJETITEMTYPE  6         public const int ARMORITEMTYPE  7         public const int INTERNALITEMTYPE  8         public const int CASEITEMTYPE  9         public const int ENGINEITEMTYPE  10         public const int OTHERITEMTYPE  11          public const int TORSO  0         public const int ARM  1         public const int NUMBEROFMOVINGSECTIONS  2         public const int YAW  0         public const int PITCH  1         public const int AXISOFMOVEMENT  2          public const double DOUBLEHEATSINKDISSIPATION  1.4       codepre  pand heres my Weapons.csp  precodenamespace MechLab      public class Weapons              public int tons         public int heat         public int crits         public int minRange         public int maxRange         public int effectiveRange         public string hardpointType         public bool artemisCapable         public int ammoCount         public double damage         public double knock         public string weaponName         public int cost         public string equipmentName         public string shortName          void AC10                      equipmentName  Autocannon 10             shortName  AC10             crits  7             cost  400000             hardpointType  BALLISTIC             minRange  0             maxRange  effectiveRange  PROJECTILERANGEMOD             effectiveRange  450                 codepre  pI dont see anything wrong with it, but being really new to coding Im sure Im missing something fairly obvious.p

Negative 580 pI needed to map a FTP server running on Windows using PHP, so I made a function that essentially navigates through the FTPs folder structure, listing everything inside it and calls itself recursively when it encounters a subfolder.p  pEverything worked fine in my development environment, but things took a sour turn once I migrated everything to the clients infrastructure. Their FTP server holds 30GB of data a lot of files, but not as many as you would expect, since many are  100MB, so I was expecting it to be slowish, but 90 to 120 seconds seemed a lot.p  pTherefore, I did some investigating with tcpdump and it is perfectly visible that the FTP server has some kind of strongantiflood protectionstrong because at a given point every request gets stalled for at least 60 seconds.

Negative 580 pIm trying to figure out how to detect a press and hold, as well as a gesture recognizer on a codeUIButtoncode. p  pI did search around and didnt find exactly what I was looking for.  Here is a quick gif to see what Im trying to do a hrefhttpblitzzmobile.comfilesbutton.gif relnofollowhttpblitzzmobile.comfilesbutton.gifa in the case of the gif the user holds on the 5 button and drags up to select the addition button. If anyone could give me a tip or point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciatedp  pstrongEditstrong  Also, Id like to know if its possible to detect the location of the drag and animate accordingly. Example if someone drags half the distance to show the new menu, the menu animates accordingly amp the method to detect the drag release, not from the codeUIButtoncode, but when the user lifts his finger after touching the codeUIButtoncode and dragging, an action is called, is this possiblep

Negative 580 pIm relatively new to RoR, and have been working on a lessonsite sharing backend.p  pCurrently I have two models Lesson and Revision. The idea is that a teacher would create a lesson with a title, description, etc., at the lessonnew page. The form would redirect to another form with other fields content, comments at the lessonlessonidrevisionnew page. Eventually teachers will be able to save and modify lessons by copying revisions to their own profile, but the model isnt there yet.p  pIm still focusing on two supposedly basic issues, both in creating new lessons and revisions.p  p1 Saving the lessons to a user, and revisions to a user and lesson. At one point I had revisions saved to users, but lessons were not saving.p  p2 Redirecting from the lesson form to the revision form, and the revision form to the revision page. Ive tried changing the redirects in the controller and one of the formfor blocks, to no avail. The new lesson form still wants to go to lessons rather than lesson1revisionnew, which Ive tried to redirect to with newlessonrevisionpath. The revision form also just goes back to revisions, which will be an admin index but Id rather go to lesson1revision1 etc.p  pThanks in advance for any advice on either or both of these issuesp  pBelow is my code for reference.

From the research shown in the links above, codeUrlPathEncodecode is supposed to ignore encoding after the codecode, however you can clearly see that it codecode encoded the spaces in the query string portion of this url. This is a good thing, I suppose, but not consistent with what I understand of the documentation.li ol  pI suppose I am still at a loss, but every local and external links I have tried have neither been broken nor dangerous that I can tell, so I will continue to use this until my understanding of this is otherwise clarified.p

Negative 580 pWhen I work with maps, I tend to prefer ones whose elements can be iterated through in the same order they were inserted. It makes them feel more deterministic and easier to test. For this reason and others Ive always been a sucker for LinkedHashMap in Java.p  pIn the FP world, for lookups there is a preference for trees over maps. True, in Scala there is an immutable version of LinkedHashMap called ListMap, but it doesnt use hashes and seems too slow for most practical uses.p  pIf I want to get the advantages of immutability, how can I satisfy my thirst for data structures that remember insertion order as well as having fast lookup Has somebody written something in a library somewherep

It also writes a logfile of the notifications it displays.p  pThis tool is normally spawned by a main user application and as long as the main application is a normal application, these notifications do work as intended.p  pWhen this tool is spawned by a Windows Service, no notifications are displayed, naturally. The Desktop Session for the service isnt visible. But this would be OK, we have the logfile and these notifications are just  notifications, nothing the user absolutely must see under all circumstances.p  pThe question now becomes strongIs a process running in the context of a Servicestrong the Service itself or any process it starts strongallowed to make Windows API calls that display a visible GUIstrongp  ul liWill most Windows API calls e.g. creating and showing a window, using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopbb76215928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowShellNotifyIcona, etc. behave the same in the invisible session of the serviceli liOr would I have to make sure throughout the source code, that no GUI displayingmodifying stuff is called in the context of the serviceli ul  pAnd yes, calling a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64550528vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMessageBoxa is a bad idea because it will block. But I can handle these calls.p  pAnd yes, this could be designed better, but its what I have at the moment and it would be nice if I hadnt to rip the whole tool apart to make sure no GUI related code is run in the service.p

Negative 580 pGrails is able to configure dependencies when you specify them in the BuildConfig.groovy file.  Usually when you add it there and call codegrails compile refreshdependenciescode it will resolve the dependency, and download to .grailsivycache..... in my case.  However, one time, after downloading the jar files, it failed to automatically add the jar to the classpath. Does anybody have any idea on how this will happen  It has worked for me before on many other Maven repository dependencies.  The specific dependency I failed to add to my Grails project classpath is a hrefhttpmvnrepository.comartifactjavax.mailmail1.4.7 relnofollowhttpmvnrepository.comartifactjavax.mailmail1.4.7ap  pI can just manually add the lib to the classpath, but Id rather have dependencies resolved automatically with the BuildConfig.groovy file.  I also cant manually add jars into the Grails Dependencies library in the classpath they can only be outside that library.p

Negative 580 pI have a static lib codelibTheLib.acode compiled by someone else. I am trying to link it with my program. One of the functions that this lib requires for linking is codeGetNamecode. I have a function codevoid GetNamechar, intcode in my project, but the linker is still complaining the the symbol is not found. I am guessing that maybe the lib is looking for a function with a different signature. I tried using codenmcode hoping it will reveal what exactly is being looked for, but all it says isp  precode         U GetName codepre  pwhich is not very helpful. Is there another way to find the signature of the symbol it is looking for Or is the signature not part of the symbol, and it can actually link to any symbol of that namep  pThe lib is written in codeCcode, my program in codeCcode, but the function is declared as p  precodeextern C GetNamechar c, int i ... codepre  pAlso, this is using codeclangcode, not codegcccode, if it makes a difference using XCodep
Negative 580 pI have been trying to make my first GUI music player in Java. So far I have been able to play MP3 with Javasound and MP3SPI. Now, I want to support .m4a songs and from what I have researched the best library to do this is JAAD.

I no longer use another thread at all, I just make one of those timer objects and have a tick event handler calculating the time between clicking the start button and the tick event. I can even set the period for my ticks to 1ms so I get my cool looking countdown, and its apparently using 0 CPU  Im quite happy with this.p

Negative 580 pIve got two loaders, each of which loads data from a different content provider.p  pThe fragment is supplied with the ID of a medication from the first content provider, and the first loader loads all of the information related to that medication. The second loader is supposed to query the second content provider for all of the alarms associated with that medication.p  pThe first loader works just fine, and returns all of the correct data. However, the second loader appears to return a null cursor, even though I know for a fact that there is plenty of data in the table that should be relevant. I say appears because using getCount on the data in in onLoadFinished for the second loader causes my app to crash, and the only reason I can think that this would occur is if the cursor were null.p  pAnyway, heres the code for my loaders.

Negative 580 pI would appreciate your help.p  pI am using the function codewindRosecode of the codeopenaircode package for R. I am doing wind roses for wind  date from many stations, and I need to compare the results from all roses together. The problem is that the codewindRosecode function fixes the maximum radius of the windrose to a little bit more than the maximum  of counts found in any direction. How can I control the maximum scale of the windrose, lets say putting a fixed maximum of 30 for the max plotting radius instead of the default maximum put by the function and which depends on my data I have explored the code of the function but I have not been able to locate the position in the codewindRosecode function code where I could do this change.p

Negative 580 pIm kind of new to all of this and was hoping I could get some help. Some background that leads to my question is that I am building a small php interface that outputs a table. That table gets values from SQL Server. I have to display 4 tables. 34 table display successfully and dynamically where if the a column or row is added on the SQL server side it will update the php interface tables automatically. The 4th table is giving me an issue. Ive at least identified why it breaks the job the reason is because two columns in the table are datetime values in comparison to varchar or nvarchar values. p  pEssentially, the way i have it framed up in my head is to create an IF statement in my forloop that will read the data type of each column, and IF it is a datetime type it will put it in the correct PHP date format, and if not it will put it in the regular format. this maintains dynamics within the interface, ive done it all successfully, by hard coding the columns, but im trying to make my interface futureproofp  pthis is what i had in mind for an if statementp  plets say field is equivalent to the columns datavaluedatatype. This is the variable i use to echo the data from sql server.p  precodefield  sqlsrvgetfieldresult, i ifgettypefield  DateTime       echo lttdgt.dateformatfield, Ymd His.lttdgt  else      echo lttdgt.field.lttdgt  codepre  pIve tried it and it doesnt work.

Negative 580 pIm reading from multiple log files and appending the lines to a codeStringBuildercode object. However, some of the lines have funky characters and this causes the StringBuilder to silently fail. I believe it appends the last line with the offending characters but does not append any lines at all after that.

Negative 580 pI have this table of input fields that a user will fill out. As you can see, theres two pairs of fields, four columns across and and a minimum of five rows in length with the ability to dynamically add more rows as necessary. Ive been struggling with how to name the input fields so that they can be grouped together correctly when the form is submitted. Ive tried different variations of rows, etc. but none is working quite right. I would like for each pair to be in an array together, i.e. p  precode[0] gt drum  value [0] gt size  value [1] gt drum  value [1] gt size  value codepre  pHeres the table as I have it now.

Negative 580 pI have revised my question in response to being put on hold. Hopefully this will better match SO standards.p  pThe purpose of this program is to build and send UDP packets which use Alternating Bit Protocol as a simple resending mechanism. I have confirmed already that the packets can be sent and received correctly. The issue is with the ABP bit and its flipping.p  pThe problem facing me now is that despite trying multiple different methods, I cannot flip the ABP bit used for confirming that a packet or ack received is the correct numbered one. I start out by sending a packet with ABP bit0, and in response, the receiving process should see this and send back an ack with ABP bit0. Upon receiving that, the sender program flips its ABP bit to 1 and sends a new packet with this ABP bit value. The receiver will get that, send a matching ack with ABP bit1, and the sender will receive, flip its bit back to 0, and continue the cycle until the program has finished sending information.p  pCode below, sorry for length, but it is complete and ready to run. The program takes four command line arguments, here is the command I have been usingp  precode python ftpc.py 164.107.112.71 4000 8000 manygettysburgs.txt codepre  pwhere ftpc.py is the name of the sender program, 164.107.112.71 is an IP address, 4000 and 8000 are port numbers, and manygettysburgs.txt is a text file I have been sending. It should not make a difference if a different .txt is used, but for full accuracy use a file with a length of between 8000 and 9000 characters.p  precodeimport sys import socket import struct import os import select  def flipBitval   flip ABP bit from 0 to 1 and vice versa     foo  1  val     return foo  def buildPacketHeaderIP, Port, Flag, ABP     pack IP for transport      split into four 1byte values     SplitIP  IP.split.      create a 4byte struct to pack IP, and pack it in remoteIP     GB  struct.Struct4B      remoteIP  GB.packintSplitIP[0],intSplitIP[1],intSplitIP[2],intSplitIP[3]     remoteIP is now a 4byte string of packed IP values      pack Port for transport      create a 2byte struct to pack port, and pack it in remotePort     GBC  struct.StructH      remotePort  GBC.packintPort    needs another byte     remotePort is now a 2byte string      add flag     flag  bytearray1     flag  strFlag      add ABP     ABP  flipBitABP     abp  strABP      create header and join the four parts together      Header  .joinremoteIP     Header  remotePort     Header  flag     Header  abp      return Header   assign arguments to local values  IP  sys.argv[1] PORT  sys.argv[2] TPORT  sys.argv[3] localfile  sys.argv[4]  declare the socket s  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKDGRAM  create destination information arrays remoteIP  bytearray4 remotePort  bytearray2  create flag array flag  bytearray1  create ABP bit bit  1 print bit  send file size packet  get size of file from os command filesize  bytearray4 save as 4byte string filesize  stros.statlocalfile.stsize  package the filesize string filesizestr  buildPacketHeaderIP,PORT,1,bit  build header print bit filesizestr  filesize                             complete the packet s.sendtofilesizestr, 127.0.0.1, intTPORT    send packet   end of send file name packet   begin listening for responses read, write, err  select.select[s], [], [], 1    timeout set to 1 seconds  if lenread gt 0     data received     data  read[0].recv1200     if data[7]  bit         print failed ack         resend packet else     print Timeout.     resend packet  send next data packet  get filename as string from arg4 diredtly filename  bytearray20 save as 20byte string filename  localfile  package the filename string filenamestr  buildPacketHeaderIP,PORT,2,bit  build header print bit filenamestr  filename                             complete the packet s.sendtofilenamestr, 127.0.0.1, intTPORT    send packet  end of send file name packet   send file content packet  reading while loop goes here  with openlocalfile, rb, 0 as f open the file      while True         fstr  f.read1000              if not fstr             print NOTHING             break          put together the main packet base         filecontentstr  buildPacketHeaderIP,PORT,3,bit         print bit          filecontentbytearray  bytearray1000  create ytear array         filecontentbytearray  fstr             assign fstr to byte array          filecontentsend  .joinfilecontentstr   copy filecontentstr to new string since we will be using filecontentstr again in the future for other packets           filecontentsend  filecontentbytearray append read data to be sent          s.sendtofilecontentsend, 127.0.0.1, intTPORT    send the file content packet  end of send file content packet s.close codepre  pIn this code, every time that buildPacketHeader is called, it performs flipBit as part of its operations. flipBit is supposed to flip the bits value for ABP.

That said, I am completely baffled as to why it is not working as expected in this program. I would assume that it is my inexperience with python that is at fault, for despite having now used it for a decent amount of time, there still are peculiarities which escape me.

Negative 580 pIm trying to write a directive to move an element from one position on screen to another on click, using a CSS transition, where the position is determined by Javascript  attribute on the element, and not known ahead of time in the prewritten CSS. Also, I need a callback, to a function in the scope, done at the end of the transition, which is specified in a custom attribute. So the element looks likep  precodeltbutton moveme100 movemeafterafterMovegtMove Meltbuttongt codepre  pIn order to use animate for this, in my custom directive moveMe, on click I dynamically add a style block to the pagep  precodeltstylegt .moveme1 ....ltstylegt codepre  pand then usep  precodeanimate.addClassiElement, moveme1, function  ...  codepre  pto handle the animation and the callback once its finished. An example plunkr is available atp  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditXRMRO93vl248Ve02Jnpoppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coeditXRMRO93vl248Ve02Jnpoppreviewap  pThis seems overly complicated adding emstyleem tags to the page seems quite convoluted. Im doing this so the transition itself can be specified in an external style sheet, in terms of the run time, and the timing function, and using animate.addClass so Angular can then determine the correct time to fire the callback.p  pIs there a simplerbetter way of achieving what I wantp  pThis example is simplified to my actual use case. In my case the element animated is created in the directive, and removed at the end, and is purely a temporary visual aid. In addition to position, height  width are also dynamically determined for both the start and final style of the element, using a CSS transition between the states. Each of the styles can have a different transition time  timing function to achieve the effect Im after. Multiple elements can be moved to  from different positions at the same time, so the JSCSS must allow that.p

Negative 580 pIn Agner Fogs manual a hrefhttpwww.agner.orgoptimizeoptimizingcpp.pdf relnofollowOptimizing software in Ca in section 9.10 Cahce contentions in large data structures he describes a problem transposing a matrix when the matrix width is equal to something called the critical stride.  In his test the cost for for a matrix in L1 is 40 greater when the width is equal to the critical stride.  strongIf the matrix is is even larger and only fits in L2 the cost is 600strong  This is summed up nicely in Table 9.1 in his text.

The only example I have read of is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7327994prefetchingexamplesPrefetching Examplesa and its only a O10 improvement on some machines.  Agner later explains this p  blockquote   pThe reason is that modern processors prefetch data automatically thanks to       outoforder execution and advanced prediction mechanisms. Modern microprocessors are       able to automatically prefetch data for regular access patterns containing multiple streams       with different strides. Therefore, you dont have to prefetch data explicitly if data access can       be arranged in regular patterns with fixed strides.p blockquote  pstrongSo how does the CPU decide which data to prefetch and are there ways to help the CPU make better choices for the prefetching e.g. regular patterns with fixed stridesstrongp  pstrongEditstrong Based on a comment by Leeor let me add to my questions and make it more interesting.  strongWhy does the critical stride have so much more of an effect on L2 compared to L1strongp  pstrongEditstrong I tried to reproduce Agner Fogs table using the code at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11413855whyistransposingamatrixof512x512muchslowerthantransposingamatrixofWhy is transposing a matrix of 512x512 much slower than transposing a matrix of 513x513a I ran this with MSVC2013 64bit release mode on a Xeon E5 1620 Ivy Bridge which has L1 32KB 8way, L2 256 KB 8way, and L3 10MB 20way.

If I use the same route and code to emeditem an existing graphsay I edit the destinations label andor the destinationMatchRules priorityI have big problems with both codebelongsTodestination,  async true code relationships.p  pIve put breakpoints in my serializers codeserializeBelongsTocode method and all over my codesavecode method. It seems that the following is happeningp  ol listrikeIf the codeDestinationMatchRulecode and codeChargeRulecode objects in the codehasManycode are not newly created records, calling code.savecode on the codeDestinationcode record automatically tries to save the records in the codehasManycodes, so the explicit child record codeitem.savecode calls in my codesavecode method above are preempted in this case. I thinkthis is a part Im slightly less sure aboutstrikeli liWhen the codeserializeBelongsTocode method of the serializer is called for the codeDestinationMatchRulecode and codeChargeRulecode records, the codedestinationcode property of each is a codeDS.PromiseObjectcode, emandem the promise is emunsettledem. This results in codeserializeBelongsTocode adding codedestination undefinedcode to the JSON object, and ultimately in the codedestinationcode property being emdroppedem completely from the serialized JSON sent to the backend.li ol  pNaturally, this causes my backend to think that the codedestinationcode object for the child records has been removed which in my case causes a cardinality violation.p  pstrikeWhen I put logging statements near my explicit codeitem.savecode calls, I see instead that the codeDS.PromiseObjectcode emisem settled, which is why I conclude what I described in 1 above. I first tried wrapping those calls in all manner of codeEmber.run.nextcode callbacks to try to give the codebelongsTocode time to settle, but if Im correct about 1 that wont help anyway. But that also means I have no place to try and work around the problemstrikep  pCan somebody please help me figure this outIm so close and I think this may be the last battle in getting Ember Data to actually work and be used in an ambitious web application. p  h2Edith2  pCorrection, my conclusion about the order of operations here was incorrect. In fact I emcanem make it work for both newly created graphs and editing existing ones by making my codesavecode method look like thisp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodesave function      var destination  this.getcontent     destination.save.thenfunction         var promises  Ember.A         destination.getdestinationMatchRules.forEachfunctionitem             item.getdestination.thenfunction                 item.save                              promises.pushitem.save                  destination.getchargeRules.forEachfunctionitem             item.getdestination.thenfunction                 item.save                               Ember.RSVP.Promise.allpromises.thenfunctionresolvedPs             alertAll saved                codepre  pBUT, this doesnt scale well what if I had more codebelongsTocode relationships Might they all have to settle Also its now much harder to tell when the whole operation is completeI cant add the codeitem.savecode returned promise to my promises array because it isnt created immediately hints on this welcome in comments. And, should I be codethencodeing some other promise that I dont see, to make sure that the codedestination.savecode is really emreallyem complete, and all the relationships have been propagatedp

Other times, I return 302 and redirect them to a login page. p  pIs there standard that I should be following here When should 401s be used When should I redirect to a login page For example,p  ul liShould codeGETscode be redirected li liShould codePOSTscode get a code401code li liWhat do I do for AJAX requests where a 302 wouldnt be followedli ul  pOr perhaps this is all just matter of opinion, a convention that I need choose and enforce on my own.p
Negative 580 pI want to fit a histogram by the sum of two gaussians, both with different amplitude, mean and deviation. To do that, I have used scipys curvefit, but the KStest afterwards was awful. That was mostly because the first few as in the most negativ x values values were not very accurate, and therefor the cumulative function was way off. I also noted that the cumulative function was off by 20, and therefor an accurate outcome of the KStest is impossible. p  pThen I tried to make a constraint to the integrand, following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16541171howdoiputaconstraintonscipycurvefitthis questiona. The relevant code I got is the following without importing and plotting partp  precodedef residualsp, x,y     integral  quad gauss2, 300, 300, args p[0],p[1],p[2],p[3],p[4],p[5][0]     penalization  abs1integral10000     print penalization     return y  gauss2x, p[0],p[1],p[2],p[3],p[4],p[5]   penalization def gauss2x,A, mu, sigma, A2, mu2, sigma2     if A2lt0       return 1000     return Anp.expxmu22.sigma2 A2np.expxmu222.sigma22  hist, binedges  np.histogramdata, normedTrue, binsbins histcmnp.cumsumhist bincentres  binedges[1]  binedges[1]2 coeff, pcov2  leastsqresiduals, x00.01,0.,60.,0.01,150.,40. ,argsbincentres, hist histfit  gauss2bincentres, coeff histfitcmnp.cumsumhistfit KStest stats.ks2samphistcm,histfitcm codepre  pThis results in a pretty good estimate, and a Pvalue of 0.629. As far as I know, this means that the histogram and the fit have a 62.9 change of coming from the same data, is this correctp  pNow I thought that I could improve the answer by not penalising for the integrand, but for the Pvalue. For this I changed the codedef residualscode with the followingp  precodedef residualsp, x,y     global bincentres its global defined, so should be good     iets  np.cumsumgauss2bincentres,p[0],p[1],p[2],p[3],p[4],p[5]     pizzastats.ks2sampnp.cumsumy,iets[1]     penalization  10001pizza     return y  gauss2x, p[0],p[1],p[2],p[3],p[4],p[5]   penalization codepre  pSince the Pvalue which I call codepizzacode should reach as close to 1 as possible, the codepenalizationcode becomes smaller with a higher Pvalue. But this gives results which make less sense the Pvalue turns out to be 0.160. When plotting its even worse two spikes, instead of the smooth fit I obtained with the first method.p  pIs a KStest a good penalisation method, instead of the integrand How can implement it in a good way thenp

Negative 580 pI think I am going about this the wrong way so need a little help, please. p  pstrongMy Goalstrong p  pI have a UIImageView which displays a single image to the user. The view is in a UIView. When the user taps on the image I would like it to go into a full screen mode. Much like the current Facebook and eBay iOS apps do on iPhone. p  pOnce in this mode, the user can zoom on the image and when done  swipe up  down on the image and it then goes back to the last view. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am not entirely sure how this is done. On the apps mentioned, there is a new bar that appears at the bottom of the screen  the bar allows the user to do other actions. This, along with the swipe gesture makes me believe this full screen mode is actually presented with a new view controller. Also I noticed that as you scroll up or down on the eBay iOS app, the background starts to change to a clear colour where you see the view it was presented from. I did not know this was possible with a UIViewController when dismissing it  I just am not too sure how it is done. p  pI tried setting my UIImageView to full screen  but it misses everything else as described above. p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction. Id really appreciate it. p  pThanksp

Negative 580 pI need to map a string param with a webapi method. Something easyp  precodeapimycontrollerthisismyinputparam codepre  pI know how to do it and its working fine. However, problem is that my input param can have a query string. Something likep  precodeapimycontrollertermp1ampnvalue codepre  pand I want that webapi map the entire termp1ampnvalue with the input param in the method. I just wanna tell webapi ey, just take all the string you have after apimycontroller and send it to the action as input parameterp  pI know that probably is not the best architectural thing, but I need it that way. Also, I dont know how many params and names I can have, so I cant use a complex type. I also need it as a GET. I know how to do it with a POST, but I need a GET if its possible.p  pMany thanks.p
Negative 580 pI want a window to show on top of all existing windows It should also display on all workspaces if you have a multiple workspace system.p  pA typical application for this is showing a notification.p
Negative 580 pIm new to bootstrap and working on a project to help figure it out. I also dont know much LESS yet.p  pI have 2 columns colxs3 and colxs9. In the 9 column, I have a canvas that I would like to retain a particular aspect ratio. I dont actually care what the aspect ratio is, as long as its the same everywhere. Specifically, as wide as the column and a proper height for the given width.p  pIve tried using percentages for width and height, but even if that did work, itd be less than ideal in a dynamic height column.p
Negative 580 pIm looking to implement a searchfilter function. It will use a drop down bar as its inputs so we the user chooses from a set of options. p  pHow my system works now is this There is a Meteor.users collection, and an Instruments collection. Basically, each user has a list of instruments he plays for example, Bob plays piano and violin, Alice plays the piano and the flute. In this case, there are 4 objects in the Instruments collection p  p1 type Piano    owner bobs IDp  p2 type Violin    owner bobs IDp  p3 type Piano    owner Alices IDp  p4 type Flute    owner Alices IDp  pSo what Im trying to do is, when I choose piano on my drop down list, and then click search, I want it to display Bob and Alices profiles. I guess this should be done using Meteors publish feature, but just not sure how to do it Im a beginner here. p  pFor example, if how do I tell that specific publication to run when I hit search I see examples of people setting publish rules to only publish the subset they are searching for, but how do we tell it when to happen Do we use another template for that so that when we click search, the URL path changes and thus a different templatep  pTo be clear, my question is just how should I go about doing this. Thanksp
Negative 580 plets say we create a branch codenewbranchcode. We change 1 file there, commit this one file, push and create a pull request to codeparent repmastercode.p  pmeanwhile parent rep changed quite a bit, lets say 100 files were changed but that 1 file wasnt touched.p  pAnd still, pull request diff will show that only 1 file was changed.p  pSo how codeGITcode understands that actually 1 file needs to be merged only, and not 101 files. I mean codeparent repmastercode compare to codechild repnewbranchcode in fact 101 files were changed and not 1 file..p

Negative 580 pSo I have been doing some research into how I should be doing trycatchfinally blocks and there is some conflicting information in every post I read.  Can someone clarifyp  pOne common idea is to not catch exceptions that you do not know what to do with at that point in the code.  The exception will bubble up until it presumably gets to a global exception handler if nothing else catches it.  So at that point you display a message to the user that an unknown type of exception occurred, log it, etc.p  pNow after reading it sounds like this is the only exception handler that you will need  You should not be using it for flow control, so you should be checking if something is returned as null or is invalid causing the exception and correcting it in code.  ie. testing for null and doing something about it before it can cause the exception.p  pBut then there are other things such as running out of memory that you would not be able to test for, it would just occur during an operation and the exception would be thrown.  But I would not be able to do anything about this either so this would be bubbled up to the global handler.p  pI think there are some that I am missing, like when dealing with files there can be some thrown from the external code.  File not found exception seems like one that may come up often, so I would catch it and in the finally block gracefully close down anything I opened related to other codeprocessing and then notify the user and log it right therep  pThe only reason why you would want to catch an exception is for the finally part of the block to make sure that whatever you started before the exception is closedfinalized in a known state  But even then you would want to throw this exception after performing these tasks so the user is notified by the global exception handler, there is no point duplicating this code at this pointp  pSo other than a global exception handler you would have trycatchfinally blocks for these scenarios.p  pSo assuming that I am missing something here, there may be the possibility that you want to try and catch a specific type of exception and then do something with it.  I cannot think of anything that you would want to do in the catch block though since the global one would lognotify the user and if you have an exception that usually means that there is no deal for the code to continue on.p  pIs there any easy way to know which exceptions will be thrown from which modules  I think the only way I have read is to read the MSDN or component suppliers documentation, other than that there is no way to know what exception you would be trying to catch if you were looking for a specific one not sure why you wouldp  pThis question came up since in my application I had a section of code in a trycatch block, and it ended up that when an exception occurred it was either because an object was null, or a string was invalid.  Once I wrote code to handle those scenarios the trycatch block is no longer needed, if an exception is encountered now there is nothing the code can do to recover so it should be logged and let the user know so it can be fixed.p  pBut this goes against what I have been reading and what has been preached to me, bad code is code with no trycatch blocks.  So how does this all tie together and what piece am I missing herep

Im representing this in my code as a simple twodimensional codebooleancode arrayp  precode                X  Xvalue, also increasing width    Y  Yvalue, also increasing length                                                             Y     X gt codepre  pSome of the squares can be taken up in rectangles by buildings, etc. like this input codecode  takenp  precode        3 taken rectangles                            codepre  pIn the 2D codebooleancode array, taken squares are set to codetruecode and open, nontaken squares are set to codefalsecode.p  h2My problemh2  pI need to find all open rectangles nontaken that are of a specific size. This is because I need to find emallem the possible spaces to put the next building. For example, from the previous figure, if I wanted to get all open 1x2 rectangles I should get these outputsp  precode 1 122  3 taken rectangles input  4 open 1x2 rectangles output    Open rectangles are numbered   3 3    Rectangles can overlap.  The 12 square represents the overlapping 4 4    of rectangle 1 and 2.        Haha, my diagram kind of looks like old Minesweeper  codepre  h2What Ive doneh2  pHeres Ive tested bruteforce search, code is C and a bit of pseudocode p  precodeListltRectanglegt findOpenSpacesboolean[][] area, int width, int length      ListltRectanglegt openSpaces  new ListltRectanglegt     boolean open  true      Loop through all rectangles with size width and length     for x  0 to total area length  length          for y  0 to total area width  width               Check this rectangle to see if any squares are taken             Rectangle r  new Rectanglex, y, width, length             if checkRectanglearea, r returns true                   rectangle was fully open, add to the list                 openSpaces.Addr                                return openSpaces   boolean checkRectangleIsOpenboolean[][] area, Rectangle r      for i  r.x to r.width          for j  r.y to r.length              if area[i][j] is true                   means that this square in the rectangle is taken,                  thus the rectangle is not fully open                  so return false not open                 return false                                return true  no square in the rectangle was taken   struct Rectangle   just a struct to help store values     int x, y, width, length  codepre  h2Questionh2  pThe above pseudocode works, but if you look at the it, its time comes to codeOn4code  I think, because of four nested codeforcode loops, but Im no expert. emPlusem, in the the game the total size rectangular area is 50x50, not 5x5 like my examples here. The game lags visibly whenever I do this operation. p  pI Googled this, but Im not exactly sure what to call this problem. Id really appreciate if anyone could show me an efficient algorithm to do this task. Thanks p

Negative 580 pI am working with the propertyGrid from Xceed WPF tookit property grid. p  pWhen I bind an object to the grid, it lists the nested classes within it using the ToString method and is readonly. I would like it to also list the properties within these nested classes. Does property grid support this Is there a better library for thisp  pe.g.p  precodeClass Parameters      public int number getset     Public CustomVector vector1 get set      Public CustomVector vector2 get set   Class CustomerVector      public double a get set     public double b get set     public double c get set     public double d get set  codepre  pIn this case it would just list 3 elements, returning the ToString for vector1 and vector2. I would like it to let me edit a,b,c,d of both vectors.p

Negative 580 pIm trying to add fb friends scores table and Im facing the problem by sorting them. From request, Im getting two mutable arrays, one with friends name and one with their scores. Now I need to sort the scores in descending order from highest to lowest. Sorting only scores is easy with this code    p  precodeNSSortDescriptor scoreSorter [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyself ascendingNO] [self.friendScoresArray sortUsingDescriptors[NSArray arrayWithObjectscoreSorter]] codepre  pbut if I do like this, Im losing the connection between name and score, so I need to sort the names also now. Heres the example what happens nowbr After requestbr Name  Scorebr Name One  110br Name Two  120br Name Three  100br After sorting the scoresbr Name One  120br Name Two  110br Name Three  100 This is obvious of course, but just a quick example of what Im getting. Also, Ive tried old method from C called bubble method. Its worked, but its slow and sometimes giving ascending order, so that is bad practice in my opinion. So, whats the best way to sort out those to arrays without loosing connect between name and score Thank you.p

Negative 580 pWe are using Silverlight with VB in the background.  We would like to append a custom http header to ALL call requests that are made by a third party API, specifically the ESRI ArcGIS Silverlight Api.  Anyone aware of how to do this specifically, how to inspect requests before they leave the app, how to do this via that Api or plain ol VBp  pThe reason we are looking to do this is because we want to setup a proxy which will look for the custom header in order to apply the appropriate credentials.  Our Javascript apps works fine because they send the Referer Header, however Silverlight only does so in IE go figure.p

Negative 580 pGood day. I have a web application where a user fills out several forms. These forms can then be edited and I want to log the edits in my database as well in a form of an audit trail by getting all the dirty fields in the form and logging the codenamecode and codevaluecode in the database.p  pInitially, I had a problem with Radio Buttons that had the same name since they were marked as dirty but I eventually managed to solve that. My issue now, however, are the fields inside a FieldContainer. Even if I unmark them as dirty, when I run the code that checks for dirty fields, the fields inside the FieldContainer are marked as dirty. p  pHeres the code that I run on preloading of the form to make my buttons cleanp  precodeform.items.filterByfunctionc      ifc.getXTyperadiofield         c.originalValue  c.getValue         c.checkDirty          else          ifc.getXTypefieldcontainer         c.items.filterByfunctiond             ifd.getXTypecheckboxfield  d.getXTypetextfield                 d.getXTypecombobox                  console.logitemID of field in fieldContainer    d.getItemId                  d.originalValue  d.getValue                 d.checkDirty                  console.logcomponent dirty state    d.isDirty                              codepre  pWhat my function does is it iterates through every child view element of the form. As you can see, I have two if conditions. My first if condition checks if the element is a radio button, if so, I just mark it as clean. The second if statement checks if the element is a field container. If so, I check all the children view elements in the field container and I look for check boxes, text fields, and combo boxes, then mark them as clean. Heres the console log that I got from thatp  precodeitemID of field in fieldContainer  amountFinanced component dirty state  false itemID of field in fieldContainer  unitTerm component dirty state  false codepre  pI counter checked with my View and those are the right itemIDs and they are marked as clean.p  pNow, I create my audit trail records on button click. The general idea is that I get the active form, go through the fields and check which ones are dirty. Heres my codep  precodeform2.items.filterByfunctionc     ifc.getXTyperadiofield  c.getXType combobox         c.getXTyperadiogroup  c.getXType textfield         c.getXTypedatefield  c.getXType fieldset         c.getXTypefieldcontainer  c.getXType checkbox           ifc.getXTypefieldcontainer             ifc.isDirty                 var entry                   ifc.getXTyperadiofield                     entry  c.getName     c.getSubmitValue                                  else                     entry  c.getName     c.getRawValue                                   changes.pushentry                               else             c.items.filterByfunctiond                 ifd.getXTyperadiofield  d.getXType combobox                     d.getXTyperadiogroup  d.getXType textfield                     d.getXTypedatefield  d.getXType fieldset                     d.getXTypefieldcontainer  d.getXType checkbox                       ifd.getXTypefieldcontainer ampamp d.getXTypelabel                         console.logitem id    d.getItemId                         console.logitem name    d.getName                         console.logcomponent dirty state    d.isDirty                          ifd.isDirty                              var entry                               ifd.getXTyperadiofield                                 entry  d.getName     d.getSubmitValue                                                          else                                 entry  d.getName     d.getRawValue                                                          changes.pushentry                                                                                            codepre  pThis is a bit lengthier than the previous one. I start by going through all the view elements inside the form and I filter through all the element XTypes that I used. If I come across something thats not a field container, I check if its dirty, if its dirty, I take the codenamecode and codevaluecode of the field and put it in an array that I will later on save to my database. However, if its a field container, I check the elements in that field container to check if those are dirty then Ill save them. p  pNow. I also log the item IDs as well as the name of the fields inside the fieldcontainer. I checked if marking the fields inside the fieldset as clean as I did when I loaded the forms would help. However, upon checking the console for logs, I saw that the fields inside the fieldcontainer was marked as dirty even if I didnt change them. Here is my logp  precodeitem id  amountField item id  amountFinanced item name  AMOUNTFINANCED component dirty state  true item id  termField item id  unitTerm  item name  TERM component dirty state  true codepre  pAs you can see, I am able to go through the field container amountField and termField respectively, navigate to the field amountFinanced  textfield, and unitTerm  comboBox, get their names, and see if theyre dirty. p  pNow Im confused, I was able to mark those fields as clean earlier, why is it that when I proceed to checking all the dirty fields, theyre now marked as dirty even if I didnt change anythingp  pIs there a better way to check if the fields inside a field container and a field set are dirty Ive been stuck with this problem for several hours now and the frustration is getting to me.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 580 pI apologize of this question has been asked before. I tried searching around, but was unable to find a relevant answer probably due to my relatively small webdesign vocabulary.p  pIve noticed that the majority of websites have at least oneif not morestandard objects or whatever the actually name is for them on almost all of their pages. For instance, Stack Overflow has the same logo and tabs Questions, Tags, Users... on every page. Im assuming that theres a less painstaking way to set this up other than simply copying and pasting the same code over and over, especially when ease of modification becomes a factor. As far as I know, CSS cant do accomplish this level of style generalization, so Im assuming a serversided language like PHP is part of the equation.p  pIm not really looking for a very specific answer. What languageor type or languageas well as a brief synopsis of at least one way to achieve some sort of object pasting will be sufficient.p

Negative 580 pIs there any way to find out if a YamlMappingNode is merged to perform a merge operation Im coming from Java and SnakeYaml where you have a class codeMappingNodecodeand a property codeisMergedcode. Usually you would do a codeifcode to see if it is merged and if yes you would start to flatten the mapping via codeSafeConstructorflattenMappingMappingNodecode.p  pOr does the parser automatically recognise back references and merge it Normally if the parser matches the specific tag representing the merge scalar a hrefhttpyaml.orgtypemerge.html relnofollowhttpyaml.orgtypemerge.htmla youd set it. This happens in the Java version of the YAML parser SnakeYaml.p

Memory is an issue here, as the vectors size is to remain fairly close to that of its construction.p  pIs it a good solution to extend the vectors capacity slightly beyond its initial size using stdvectorreserve, so that the small amount of extra data doesnt require it to grow If so, its probably best to construct the vector empty, reserve the capacity and emthenem resize it to its initial size, rightp

They just have copies of the method pointers verbatim and nothing else.p  pGiven that design, its easy to understand why this does not work. A new vtable would need to be constructed in runtime, which would likely reside on the stack, and that isnt exactly an elegant or optimal solution.p  pThere are some workarounds, of course, like adding explicit upcast methods to the interface, but that requires quite a bit of boilerplate or macro frenzy to work properly.p  pNow, the question is  why isnt it implemented in some way that would enable trait object upcasting Like, adding a pointer to the supertraits vtable in the subtraits vtable. For now, Rusts dynamic dispatch doesnt seem to satisfy the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLiskovsubstitutionprinciple relnofollowLSPa, which is a very basic principle for objectoriented design.p  pOf course you can use static dispatch, which is indeed very elegant to use in Rust, but it easily leads to code bloat which is sometimes more important than computational performance  like on embedded systems, and Rust developers claim to support such use cases of the language. Also, in many cases you can successfully use a model which is not pure OO, which seems to be encouraged by Rusts functional design. Still, Rust supports many of the useful OO patterns... so why not the LSPp  pDoes anyone know the rationale for such designp

Negative 580 pI need to send remote push notifications to logged in users only.

Negative 580 pIm trying to run a remote lookup to another Glassfish from a Servlet. So, I was following the link documentation a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19798018211752beanvindex.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19798018211752beanvindex.htmla. First I created a Sateless Session Ben called CalculatorBean, packaged in an EJB JAR of the same name CalculatorBean, the JNDI name was javaglobalCalculatorBeanCalculatorBean.p  pAccording to the documentation, I created a Web project and declared my EJB in subweb.xml the following filep  precodeltejbrefgt       ltejbrefnamegtejbCalculatorBeanltejbrefnamegt       ltjndinamegtcorbanameiiop127.0.0.13700CalculatorBeanCalculatorBeanltjndinamegt   ltejbrefgt codepre  pwhere 127.0.0.1 is the host of the machine local, 3700 is the default port for querying and, CalculatorBeanCalculatorBean is the global JNDI name. First question, theoretically the JNDI name passes into an interoperable String CalculatorBeanCalculatorBean instead of java globalCalculatorBeanCalculatorBean, rightp  pAfter that, I created a Servlet and put the following code snippetp  precodectx  new InitialContext  bean  CalculatorRemote ctx.lookup javacompenvejbCalculatorBean codepre  pWhere, CalculatorRemote is the name of the remote interface that we included in the java projectcompenv is the directory section to access Java EE components and ejbCalculatorBean is the name of my bean in the configuration of the sunweb.xml file  When put to run my Servlet Im getting the exceptionp  precodeCaused by javax.naming.NameNotFoundException No object bound to name javacompenvejbCalculatorBean codepre  pObviously, its not finding the name, however, do not really know what name I should use to set the lookup.p
Negative 580 pIn sails 0.10.5 express compression is supposed to be in the middleware for production mode by default according to the issues on github, but none of the response headers have the appropriate ContentEncoding to suggest that they have been gzipped.  Furthermore, the sizes of the assets all match the uncompressed assets.  p  pAfter searching for any other issues related to this, I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20743019howtogzipjavascriptandcssassetsinsailsjsthis SO questiona which was theoretically the opposite of my problem he had the gzipped files in place and needed the middleware and I have the middleware supposedly by default but no files. His problem was apparently solved by adding the middleware config, which was required for compression before 0.10.5.  So, I npm installed gruntcontribcompress and set up the config file.  Now, I have the gzipped files being produced successfully, but theyre not being served.  I tried manually requesting the gzipped version of the asset by injecting it in sailslinker instead of the regular js, but the ContentType on the response header was applicationoctectstream.p  pHas anyone successfully served gzipped static assets from a sails app  Am I doing anything obviously incorrectly  Even an outline of the general process would be appreciated.  p

I felt there are various advantages of using TestNG framework in API automation because we could just send the required API endpoints and parameters via an external file and run our automation suite. Also with many json parsers we could validate our results.p

Negative 580 pI am tyring to create a grid of particles, using the famous physics engine. I thought that if 25 particles were placed beteween 4 bounding walls forming a square and they all had an equal repulsion force to each other, they would naturally form a grid  ie. they would all be held as far away from each other as possible, given the limits of their world. I expected this to work, even if the particles were just added without an initial position. However, even if I give them an initial position, they dont hold in place unless the force is very small.p  pAlso, I thought that if a wall had a restitution of 0, then a particle would just stop on colliding with it. When I run the code below, I can see particles bouncing off walls.

To me that means that the server is failing to intialize somehow, but I really dont know. Other stuff Even while it says Initializing... I can mouse over the other buttons and click on them so the program isnt frozen. Also, the first time I ran it I had to give it permission to go through my firewall, which I did.

Negative 580 pIm currently working on developing a social network in rails. Right now Im leaning towards using some sort of VPSVPC possibly AWS but Im still somewhat confused about a few things.p  pFor example, in one of my prototypes that I hosted on Heroku I had a search feature using the sunspot gem however for this to work I had to pay Heroku for an add onWebsolr.p  pIf Im hosting on a VPS how would I go about implementing the same thing Arnt there many hosting options that wont offer that specific websolr add on Will the cost of running that search just be added into how much RAM im usingp  pPlease feel free to critique my choice of going with a VPSVPC. The reasons Im doing this is because I would like to gain experience in managing my own server and also figured in the off chance that my app is a successthat it will be the best option as I will need a large amount of storage for uploaded files users will be uploading music.p

Negative 580 pI have a WPF configuration utility with a single window that runs during my WIX installer and can also be run independently after installation. SO contains solutions to bring the window to the front but they make it either always on top or the code returns immediately.p  pWhen the application starts, I want to bring the window to the front. Left to itself, it pops under my MSI dialog. I also want to let the user move other windows on top of it it shouldnt be always on top, and I want to wait for the window to close in code. Perhaps I am being too picky as WPF does not appear to support this.p  pCurrently, I have thisp  precodeMainWindow.Topmost  true MainWindow.Show MainWindow.Activate MainWindow.Topmost  false MainWindow.Focus codepre  pIts great except that codeMainWindow.Showcode returns immediately and execution resumes. In the past, we were usingp  precodeMainWindow.TopMost  true MainWindow.ShowDialog codepre  pBut then this window is always on top and obstructs all other windows not the best user experience. Are there any other options Please feel free to suggest I am architecting this incorrectly as well. Thank youp

Negative 580 pI dont know codeASPcode, Ive just started working for a large corporation and had task with an codeaspclassiccode web app dumped in my lap and it doesnt work. No one knows anything about it and apparently I am not allowed to write to IIS log files. So far it would seem that the program is failing because as far as I can tell, the codePOSTcodeed HTTP parameters, which I can see in IE developer console, being sent in never make it to the server and can not be found in its codeRequest.Formcode. Does anyone know what to make of that and how I might be able to print out the codeResponse.QueryStringcode where I might have access to it  p  pstrongClarificationsstrong  p  ol lipI can see the log files but I can not add my own debugging lines as I am used to with codePHPcode and codeApachecode on Linux. Im a fish out of water.pli lipProof the program is failing is that there is a program called codeASPXTOASP.ASPcode which I think turns code.Netcode request parameters into classic parameters is breaking. It gets an index out of bounds exception and I think its because it is being passed an empty query string.  When I tried to write the query string somewhere it never showed up. Where might I be able to write this query string where I can view itpli lipI am not certain I know enough about all of the components of the web app to organize it into a working version on my desktop for debugging.  pli lipIve just used codeResponse.Writecode and codeResponse.Endcode to write the codeRequest.QueryStringcode to the screen. Its empty. Based on this and the fact that the program immediately preceding the one that breaks is called codelogin.aspxcode and consists of setting some EVs haing to do with AD authentication I think my issue must be an authentication configuration issue. We are using codeActive Directorycode for authentication. Could anyone tell me about any specific settings in IIS that I ask the adminssenior dev to poke at which might fix such an issuepli ol

Negative 580 pCOMPLETELY RESTATED THE QUESTION.p  pId like to write numerically into an integer type, not being sure whether or not it actually is a character type codecharcode, codewchartcode, codechar32tcode etc.p  pConsider the following codep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class MyInteger    T value public   MyInteger  value0     friend istream ampoperator gtgt istream ampin, MyInteger ampi        in gtgt i.value     return in       friend ostream ampoperator ltlt ostream ampout, const MyInteger ampi        out ltlt i.value     return out     codepre  pI want such class to handle all integer types correctly, including for example codeintleast8tcode which is likely if not guaranteed to evaluate to codecharcode.p  pThe above code is broken for this purpose. Lets assume that the template parameter codeTcode is set to codecharcode for example, by letting the compiler evaluate codeintleast8tcode. Giving this program an input of code25code will result in the character code5code being left in the input stream, and codevaluecode will be assigned emthe ASCII code of code2codeem which happens to be code50code. This is obviously wrong. Similarly, making this program print codevaluecode of code50code will result in code2code being printed instead.p  pOne obvious solution is to typecast codevaluecode to codeintcode in the overloaded codegtgtcode and codeltltcode operators. But then again, what if codeTcode is set to codeintleast64tcode Well, we could typecast codevaluecode to codeint64leasttcode instead, but what if codeTcode is set to codeuintleast64tcode Analogical, typecasting codevaluecode to codeuintleast64tcode would create problems if codeTcode is set to codeintleast64tcode. Not to mention that implementations may define their own, even larger integers. In such case codeintmaxtcode and codeuintmaxtcode could be helpful, but only if codeTcode is not set to an emevenem larger, custom integer type.p  pHere comes with help the unary codecode operator. AFAIK it is meant to promote a character integer to a normal integer, so that for example codecoutcode treats it in a proper way. And yes, with operator codeltltcode it works neatly codeout ltlt i.valuecodep  pHowever, doing same with operator codegtgtcode is far more ugly. Simply writing codein gtgt i.valuecode creates nasty compilation errors. Actually, Im not sure why. I have to use a dummy variablep  precodeauto hlp  i.value in gtgt hlp i.value  hlp codepre  pThis is ugly. But worse even, this might fail to check the range correctly. If codeistreamcode is writing into an integer value, then according to a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencelocalenumgetget relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencelocalenumgetgeta it should check whether or not the written value is in range. If its not, codefailbitcode is set, and the variable that was written to is given standard defined values. Therefore, no integer overflows arise. Here, however, I do not have the guarantee that codeauto hlpcode will be of a type of the exact size of the type of codei.valuecode. Continuing the codeintleast8tcode example, codehlpcode will be promoted to type codeintcode which is larger than codecharcode therefore, feeding the program with the input of e.g. code900code will result in codevaluecode being set to code124code.p  pOf course, we could continue with checking the range by checking codehlpcode against codenumericlimitsltTgtlowestcode and codenumericlimitsltTgtmaxcode. However, this is emonlyem possible if codeTcode is set to fundamental types. This will fail for custom integer types, since according to a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencelimitsnumericlimits relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencelimitsnumericlimitsa codenumericlimitscode may not be set for custom types.p  pI agree that this is a very much madeup problem. But this is the point  just for an exercise, Id like to be as much perfectionistic as possible.p
Negative 580 pIs it possible to use codeCOMMITcode or codeROLLBACKcode inside an codeEXCEPTIONcode blockp  pI know this may not be a good practice because the user might want to rollback after an exception occurred and if I use a codeCOMMITcode there that wont be possible. However my application wont allow any kind of rollback and everything is committed, either being a success or a failure.p

And I cant figure out why. p  pstrongWhat am I doing wrongstrongp  p DISCLAIMERS p  pa I am passing a string  with no whitespaces  such as V6E1H8 or 90210, so those are valid candidatesp  pb Yes, I know those are redundant checks in the second method, I am just debugging with various other options from the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationFoundationReferenceNSRegularExpressionClassindex.html relnofollowClass Referencea and thought to leave it in there... p  pc FYI, I got the expressions from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11230446iosvalidzipcodecheckthis answera and a few more and they check out on a hrefhttpregexpal.com relnofollowhttpregexpal.coma, so I am assuming that the patterns themselves are valid, and its an issue with my logic I am admittedly a bit fuzzy on how NSRange works and how the NSRegEx excuse the shorthand evaluates a valid result... p

Negative 580 pSo Ive seen the codeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property checked of nullcode question come up a few times before. But none of those helped me.

Negative 580 pI want to continously deploy a feature to ServiceMix 6.0, which is based on Karaf 3.0.4.p  pI first tried this using the karaf console. However there are some problems. It is for a standard karaf installation not possible to determine on the a hrefhttpskaraf.apache.orgmanuallatestdevelopersguidescripting.html relnofollowkaraf consolea if a feature is already installed see my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32076009howtotestifafeatureisinstalledinakarafconsolescriptother questiona on this. The other problem with the karaf console is that it doesnt support exit codes. So it is not possible to determine reliably if a feature installation was successfully finished.p  pI then a hrefhttphawt.iogetstartedindex.htmlUsingFuseFabric8ApacheKaraforApacheServicemix relnofollowinstalled hawtioa and tried to use the exposed JMX beans via jolokiaREST that is bundled with hawtio. The problem here is that karaf 3.0.x is a hrefhttpkaraf.apache.orgmanuallatest3.0.xusersguideprovisioning.htmlFeaturesupgrade relnofollowunable to update a featurea. Therefore features must be uninstalled first. However the a hrefhttpsgithub.comapachekarafblobkaraf3.0.xfeaturescoresrcmainjavaorgapachekaraffeaturesFeaturesService.java relnofollowFeatureServicea only offers the possibility to uninstall an explicitly specified feature. But when a previous version of the feature was installed, subfeatures were installed with it. They also need an upgrade and therefore be uninstalled first. So I would need a way to iterate over the subfeatures of a feature, which I do not have.p  pSo how can continous deployment of features to karaf 3.0.x be donep

Negative 580 pIve read a bit about what other people do to deal with different screen resolutions but Im still very confused.p  pIf I have high resolution images and sprites that I want to use, should i work with a screen that like 1080x1920 and than create some methods that scale down for lower resolution screen Or should I try to compress it down to some middle ground resolution and scale up and down as necessaryp  pAlso can anyone give me a good example of how to to the scaling for different resolutions Would I for example see what the ratio between my player sprite and my original screen lets say 16 of the width and height and when the resolution changes i just try to keep this ratio Or is there a better way to do this p  pOne more thing Im also using Box2d for physics and stuff in case that matter cause I already have to use a pixel per meter conversion to go between the two.p

Negative 580 pIve written this code, which is supposed to blur a .pgm file. Works perfectly on Linux, but it gives a wrong result on Windows. The program should be run like this filter.exe enb.pgm enbfiltered.pgm qs 3, where the 4th argument can be qscntins, depending on what sorting algorithm wants the user to use, while the 5th one its an odd number and gives the width of the blurring window it should go at least until 21. 1st argument is our .exe, the 2nd one is the initial image, while the 3rd one is the final image. On Linux, the result is the expected one, while on Windows the enb.filtered.pgm file is all black and it has wrong dimensions.

I have a vast amount of data and multiple users would want to interact with this data without the need to add any external data.p  pFor simplicity, lets assume the data is stored in flat files which I can upload on S3.

Negative 580 pI have a form with multiple added dynamic rows, and i want to do a little validation of the input before i submit the form, e.g. check if all fields have input and such. So i call this little function when i have an onclickEvent on my SubmitButtonp  precodefunction validateAndSubmit  var form  document.getElementByIdmainForm var formGroups  document.getElementsByClassNameformgroup for var x in formGroups       Validation goes here     ....     if valid  false          return       form.submit codepre  pSo in my logic, the code should iterate over each formgroup which basically represent the individual rows in the form and check if they are valid. After the first invalid row, the function will return without any result. But if all formGroups are checked, the forLoop will exit and the codeform.submitcode call will submit the form.p  pHowever, the final submit does not happen. Even if all form elements have valid input, the form does not submit. However, during some debugging i commented out the whole forloop, and the form submits, but with no validation, of course.  So i am assuming that somehow the forloop does not exit properly, and could need some help with that problem.p  pThe whole project is written in plain Javascript, however, the library i am using to dynamically add and remove items to the form bases on jQuery. p  pFor reference, you can find the project online a hrefhttpdnstest.simonszu.de relnofollowhereap
Negative 580 pI am currently finishing up my personal portfolio website and I am basically done. The desktop version of my site is working properly, and is fully responsive on all desktop screens 1324 that I tested. Every page of my desktop site is split in half, with 2 colmd6s.p  pHowever, this design isnt logical for mobiletablets, so Im trying to stack all the colmd6s from my pages as colxs12s, but it is not working correctly. In fact, it looks terrible. From what Im assuming this is because of the way rows are aligned currently. They are set up for colmd6s, and not really functioning properly when I put in the 12s. Considering this, how am I supposed to set up rows if they need to be set up differently depending on whether its mobiletablet or desktopp  pOne other question is relating to how I should do fontsize. I am currently using vm for font sizing, which works great for my desktop version. However, its gonna come out way too small on mobile.

Negative 580 pI am setting up a socket.io server to handle, well, socket requests. This is running on port 1234. This is running along side a laravel 5.1 application. Laravel is using redis to handle sessions. p  pI have plenty of tutorials on hooking up laravel with socket.io, its all pretty straight forward. I can connect, respond and forward messages back down the socket and to the laravel application.  p  pHowever every tutorial avoids the auth part of this setup. Once the message is received within the socket1234 space, how do I forward that message through to laravel while making sure that request is authed. p  pIdeally I would simply share the session, and verify the XSRF token. Because the two applications are on different ports, I cant pick up the session directly. p  pCurrently I am using an alternative approach, it involves the followingp  ul liUpon socket connection in node, I decrypt the cookie sent up on connection using nodes Crypto library and nodes PHPUnserialise library.li liThis gives me the laravel session id from the cookieli liI use this to access the redis laravel sessionli liI then decrypt that session, which in turn, gives me access to the user idli ul  pIt works, but I feel it could be potentially be a security hole, because I am not actually using token to verify the origin. p

Negative 580 pSo, Im trying to figure this out here, and Im wondering if it cant even be done in the first place.p  pAnyway, so Im using Hibernate for my ORM mapping. All that works perfectly, it builds my persistent beans perfectly, etc. The one area thats bugging me is this I have one model that, when it is created, needs to pass its values to the UI. I already have a great system set up using PropertyChangeEvents to accomplish this. All of this models fields are bound properties, whenever their values are changed, an event is fired and the UI updates. Nice, simple, elegant.p  pThe problem is that when I get this model from the database, with Hibernate, I cant add a PropertyChangeListener to it prior to Hibernate loading the model. This means that when Hibernate sets all the fields, events dont get fired. Not being able to use these PropertyChangeEvents would be a real pain, I would have to write a bunch of other code specifically to bypass the system I have set up for the entire application for this one particular context.p  pIm hoping theres a way to be able to listen to the fields getting set as Hibernate creates the model, so that the PropertyChangeEvents can make their way to my UI. If not, the best option I can think of is to create a public method in that particular model to allow for PropertyChangeEvents to be forced out for the various fields even though nothings changed.p  pHeres the code that retrieves the object from the database. Thanks in advance.p  pPS. Theres a totally unrelated bug where Hibernate is still executing updates on my database upon VM shutdown even though I dont have my program set up to do a save upon shutdown. But thats something Ill deal with in another question, after I have a chance to look over the Hibernate logs and see if I can find the problem there.p  precodepublic PortfolioModel getPortfolioint userid throws HibernateException     SQLPortfolioModel portfolio  null      Session session  null     try         session  factory.openSession         session.beginTransaction         portfolio  SQLPortfolioModel session.createCriteriaSQLPortfolioModel.class                         .addRestrictions.naturalId.setuserID, userid                         .setFetchModestockList, FetchMode.JOIN                         .uniqueResult          session.getTransaction.commit          finally         ifsession  null             session.close                    return portfolio  codepre
