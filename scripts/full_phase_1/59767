Positive 59767 pIm working on a data processing application, which after parsing through data, the data is organized as such in an associative arrayp  precodesensorNumber, timeOfReading, Count, Value 2, 32242424, 2442, 42425.545545 ... 4, 4343435, 2442, 42425.545545 ... codepre  pIts a pretty straightforward 4 column data structure, however it can get pretty large  up to 1 million rows in some extreme cases.p  pNow, I would like to add all these data points in a chart that allows a zooming feature which means no skipping points. p  pThe chart needs to separate each sensorNumber column data in separate series, in addition to that, it needs to further separate each count and value in additional subseries.p  pThe most efficient chart data insertion method uses a data structure like the followingp  precodetime, Series1, Series2, Series3... codepre  pBasically all the Y values need to be added for each X value, this makes for faster insertion than plotting each X and Y at a time.p  pWhich means I need my data structure look like the followingp  pstrongtimeOfReading, Countsensor1, Valuesensor1 ... Countsensor3,Valuesensor3...strongp  pSolution1p  p1 sort all the rows by the timeOfReading attributebr 2 create a new data structure and add columns for each Count and Value per sensor attribute to fill the rowp  pSolution2p  pUse a dictionary, that stores arrays. Make each unique timeOfReading attribute a key, and create a multicolumn array for each count and sensorp  pSolution2 seems a LOT more efficient since it does not need any sorting whatsoever. p  pHowever, Im wondering if there is an even more elegant solution to this that anybody could think ofp

Positive 59767 pSuppose in C, we have following struct p  precodestruct MyData      char key1[20]     long key2     ...   some data   codepre  pEssentially, in addition to some data, we have two keys key1 and key2. Suppose we need to manage a bunch of objects of emMyDataem in two different ways, for example, to quickly find corresponding object based on either key1 or key2 but not both. One way to meet this requirement is to build two different RBtrees or hashtables according to the two keys, respectively. In CC, the data need not to be duplicated since we only need to record the pointers of objects.p  pIn above hypothetical example, the key point is that we have a bunch of data with same type and we can organized it through two different data structures without duplicating the data in imperative language. I am wondering how pure functional programming can efficiently meet this requirement without duplicating data. To make it more general or challenging, the two data structures may not be of same type. For example, one could be rbtree and the other could be hashtable. p  pIf possible, please layout your solution in Haskell. p  pPS As a newbie to functional programming, I couldnt help wondering how to achieve some tricks from imperative programming in a pure functional programming.

Positive 59767 pI have a services table, with different service types. However, depending on the service, Id like to have a user fill out a particular web form. p  pFor example, two service types could be web development and web design. Depending on the service they choose, theyll fill out a different form. There are some overlapping fields, but they also have their own specific fields. p  pI figure I could have the form be an entity, rather than putting all the columns into the services table. So there would be a service with a serviceformid of some sort. p  pThere were two ways I thought I could go about doing this. Now keep in mind that the forms have different columns or fields. Regardless of the method, I would have a single services table and a servicestype table, and then p  ol liI could create a single table for all the forms, and all the fields. This means that columns will end up being null where the different service types dont have any overlap.li liI create separate form entities for each service type.

Positive 59767 pIs there a hashing based data structure where I can search an item in O1 time on both key and value. p  pThis can be achieved by adding duplicate entry in the list for each key value par by reversing key and value, but it will take double the space.p  pThis kind of data structure might be useful in some scenarios like I want to store opening and closing parenthesis in a map and while parsing the string, I can just check in the map if the key is present without worrying about whether it is openingclosing map or closingopening map or without storing duplicate.p  pI hope I am clear enoughp

Positive 59767 pI want to have a list of objects that satisfies just a few basic requirements. It needs to support fast random access and it needs to be safe to use from multiple threads. Reads will dominate by far and ideally should be about as fast as normal codeArrayListcode access, i.e. no locking. There is no need to insert elements in the middle, delete, or change the value at an index the only mutation required is to be able to append a new element to the end of the list. More specifically a caller will specify an index at which an element should be placed, and the index is expected to be only a few more than the length of the list, i.e. the list is dense. There is also no need for iteration.p  pIs there anything that supports this in Java It can be in a third party library.p  pIf not I am thinking I will implement my own class. Therell be an internal array of arrays, each twice as big as the last. Lookups by index will do just a little more maths to figure out which array has the right element and what the index in that array is. Appends will be similar unless they go beyond the available space, in which case a new array is allocated. Only the creation of a new array will require a lock to be acquired.p  pDoes this sound like a sensible approachp  pThis doesnt sound like a particularly novel data structure. Does it have a namep

Negative 59767 pI have a project that requires the following.p  pFour arrays will be declared in the code as suchp  precodevar ROW1  [module1] var ROW2  [module2, module3] var ROW3  [module4, module5, module6] var ROW4  [module7, module8] codepre  pEach element of these arrays represents a module in a configurable HTML widget. Based on what elements are specified in each array, the code will build an HTML  that represents these modules   each ROWx array will be a table row , and each module will be a table cell  in the table.p  pROW1 can be empty in which case it wont be included in the HTML or have one module, module1.p  pROW2, ROW3, and ROW4 can each have between 0 and 3 modules any of module2  module8, in any order.p  pUsing the example arrays above, Id programmatically generate an HTML table like thisp  precodelttablegt   lttr idrow1gt     lttd colspan6gt[module1]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow2gt     lttd colspan3gt[module2]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module3]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow3gt     lttd colspan2gt[module4]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module5]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module6]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow4gt     lttd colspan3gt[module7]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module8]lttdgt   lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pThe colspans are just there to preserve the proper table layout 6 is the lowest common multiple between 1, 2, and 3.p  pThe problem is, the content for these modules is populated dynamically I get it from an AJAX call to a URL that returns a JSON object, and content is not always available for every module. Rather than creating an empty cell  for a module with no content, I want to remove that cell completely from the layout, acting like it was never in the original configuration i.e. the arrays at top.p  pIve already spent a lot of time creating code that abstracts the module creation  it creates a shell HTML  layout based on how many modules are in each row, and then appends content to the appropriate table cell based on which module should be there. Id like to be able to continue using that code, so I think the best way to do this is to go through each element in the arrays before building the shell , and if I dont have content, remove that element from the array. Then I can use the newly modified array to build the shell per usual  Im basically just processing it beforehand to check for content in each module, and if none is available, acting like that module was never set in the initial array by removing it in the new array and then using that to build the shell .p  pFor example, lets say the configuration is set up as suchp  precodevar ROW1  [module1] var ROW2  [module4, module2] var ROW3  [module5] var ROW4  [module7, module3, module8] codepre  pI want to go through each element in each array and check for available content in the module. Lets say that there is no content available for module3 and module5. I want to then end up with these arraysp  precodevar ROW1  [module1] var ROW2  [module4, module2] var ROW3  [module7, module8] codepre  pPlease note what happened to the rows  since module5 was removed, the elements from the ROW4 array were shifted into ROW3, and ROW4 was then deleted. Also, in the new ROW3 formerly ROW4, module3 was removed, sliding module8 from position [2] into position [1].p  pSop  ul liFor any rows that have one or more elements remaining after removing modules that dont have any content, Id like to keep the row intact, even with only one module.li liFor any rows that end up with no elements remaining, Id like to shift each successive row up one, into the previous array, basically pulling a row out and shifting the lower ones up. The HTML from this example would look like thisli ul  pBEFORE as requested by configurationp  precodelttablegt   lttr idrow1gt     lttd colspan6gt[module1]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow2gt     lttd colspan3gt[module4]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module2]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow3gt     lttd colspan6gt[module5]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow4gt     lttd colspan2gt[module7]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module3]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module8]lttdgt   lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pAFTER based on what content is actually availablep  precodelttablegt   lttr idrow1gt     lttd colspan6gt[module1]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow2gt     lttd colspan3gt[module4]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module2]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow3gt     lttd colspan3gt[module7]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module8]lttdgt   lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pRecall that ROW1 is a special case, in that it doesnt affect other rows. If content is available for module1 the only module that can go in ROW1, then ROW1 should exist untouched. If no content is available, then ROW1 can be deleted, but still leaving ROW2, ROW3 and ROW4 asis i.e. not shifting them each up a row. I really only need a solution for handling ROW2, ROW3, and ROW4, since the logic for ROW1 is pretty simple.p  pIm a beginnerintermediate JavaScript programmer, and dont have a lot of experience with arrays. Ive been working on this on and off for hours, but just dont feel that what Im coming up with is a robust or elegantcompact method.p  pIf any JavaScript gurus can share a solution for this, I would VERY much appreciate it Thanks a bunch.p

Negative 59767 pScott, Id like to thank you for your BitString program.  I am working on interpreting data from a neutron detector, and Ive found that this module is just the tool I need.  Unfortunately, I have yet to get the module to successfully pass testbitstring.py.  Im running Windows XP and Python 3.1.  Ive downloaded your file bitstring0.4.1.zip from your website and extracted both bitstring.py and testbitstring.py into the lib folder of my Python directory.  Upon running testbitstring.py, I get 11 errors. p  pIve triplechecked that I have downloaded the correct version, and that both of the .py files successfully made it to me lib folder.  Is there a known complication using Windows with BitString  It is probably something I am doing, but Im at a loss as to where to go from here.  In your documentation, you explicitly say to contact you if the version is correct and the errors persist.  Im fairly certain that Im missing something obvious, but I wanted to check that this is not some sort of compatibility issue  p  pThank you for taking the time to read this.  Sorry to bother you, as Im sure you get questions about this quite a lot.  If you get the chance at all to get back to me, Im very interested in why you think it might fail the test.  Thanks againp

We cannot go and read about every tool there is in the market and what it has to offer, for each and every product.p  pThe reason for coming up with the question is recently we had to work on a project and specs for the DataAccessLayer were finalized with ADO.NET.

He was convincing. After a positive debate, we agreed to use LINQ to SQL.p  pHowever, the management was not happy about that. There argument was that we should have come up with this strongfantastic ideastrong before starting the module. Their argument is that resources have been spent on 20 of the work so far, and that work will be wasted.p  pGiven the pace of new productstechnologiesstrategies coming out frequently, we find it difficult to have all information about all these tools and technologies. p  pWeve had success using ADO.NET.

Negative 59767 pThis question is about what happens with the reorganizing of data in a clustered index when an insert is done. I assume that it should be more expensive to do inserts on a table which has a clustered index than one that does not because reorganizing the data in a clustered index involves changing the physical layout of the data on the disk. Im not sure how to phrase my question except through an example I came across at work.p  pAssume there is a table Junk and there are two queries that are done on the table, the first query searches by Name and the second query searches by Name and Something. As Im working on the database I discovered that the table has been created with two indexes, one to support each query, like sop  precodedrop table Junk1 CREATE TABLE Junk1      Name char5,       Something char5,     WhoCares int   CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IXName ON Junk1      Name   CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IXNameSomething ON Junk1      Name, Something  codepre  pNow when I looked at the two indexes, it seems that IXName is redundant since IXNameSomething can be used by any query that desires to search by Name. So I would eliminate IXName and make IXNameSomething the clustered index insteadp  precodedrop table Junk2 CREATE TABLE Junk2      Name char5,       Something char5,     WhoCares int   CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IXNameSomething ON Junk2      Name, Something  codepre  pSomeone suggested that the first indexing scheme should be kept since it would result in more efficient insertsdeletes assume that there is no need to worry about updates for Name and Something. Would that make sense I think the second indexing method would be better since it means one less index needs to be maintained.p  pI would appreciate any insight into this specific example or directing me to more info on maintenance of clustered indexes.p
Negative 59767 pIm trying to speed up my codeUIScrollViewcode and one method I know of is to set everything to be opaque.

The only green bits are outside the bounds of the contentview which I can only see when it pans out to the side and then bounces back.p  pIs there something built in to ScrollViews, or codeCATiledLayerscode that could be ignoring setOpaque or have I messed up my view hierarchy and left something notopaquep

Negative 59767 pSource control is great. One of the nice features is that I know that I can go back to previous revisions in case something messes up.p  pHowever, I still find myself loathe to delete a large batch of code that is no longer necessary, but that I might want to use parts of in the future. It really has no business in the current code base.  However, I dont like to delete it, because I dont have an easy way to trawl through my revision history and find it. Ill often cut  paste it and put it in files with such descriptive names as unused and tmp, and theyll sit there for a while.p  pThis problem would be solved if I had a great way to browse through the repository history  search for code from the past. Is there any GUI that lets me do this, or any easy to use process I can use Is there any way to do this with TortoiseSVN Right now the only approach Id know to take is to checkout different revision numbers to see if the file I want is there, and that just takes way too lang. p

Negative 59767 pIve been unable to find a workable solution to this problem, despite several similar questions here and elsewhere. It seems likely that this question hasnt been answered for Rails 3, so here goesp  pI have an application that currently allows users to create their own subdomain that contains their instance of the application. While in Rails 2 you were best served using the subdomainfu gem, in version 3 its dramatically simpler, as per the Railscast  a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes221subdomainsinrails3httprailscasts.comepisodes221subdomainsinrails3a.p  pThats good stuff, but I also want to provide the option for users to associate their own domain name with their account. So while they might have a hrefhttpuserx.mydomain.comhttpuserx.mydomain.coma, Id like them to choose to have a hrefhttpuserx.comhttpuserx.coma associated as well.p  pI found a few references to doing this in Rails 2, but those techniques dont appear to work anymore particularly this one a hrefhttpfeefighters.comdevblog20090121hostingmultipledomainsfromasinglerailsapphttpfeefighters.comdevblog20090121hostingmultipledomainsfromasinglerailsappa. p  pCan anyone recommend a way to use routes to accept an arbitrary domain and pass it along to a controller so I can show the appropriate contentp  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive gotten most of an answer now, thanks to Leonids timely response, and a fresh look at the code. It ultimately required an addition to the existing Subdomain code that I was using from the Railscast solution and then adding a bit to routes.rb. Im not all the way there yet but I want to post what I have so far.p  pIn libsubdomain.rbp  precodeclass Subdomain   def self.matchesrequest     request.subdomain.present ampamp request.subdomain  www   end end  class Domain   def self.matchesrequest     request.domain.present ampamp request.domain  mydomain.com   end end codepre  pIve added the second class in imitation of the first, which is known working. I simply add a condition that ensures that the incoming domain is not the one for which Im hosting the main site.p  pThis class is used in routes.rbp  precoderequire subdomain constraintsDomain do   match  gt blogsshow end  constraintsSubdomain do   match  gt blogsshow end codepre  pHere, Im prepending the existing subdomain code again, its working fine with a stanza to check for the Domain. If this server responds to that domain and its not the one under which the main site operates, forward to the specified controller.p  pAnd while that appears to be working, I dont quite have the whole thing working yet, but I think this particular problem has been solved.p
Negative 59767 pI have a clever program which given a file containing very specific metadata of a database, an entire project is generated for me in eclipse.  It uses hibernate to access the database and provides basic crud functionality as well as provides xhtml interface.p  pIt all works great and virtually anything can be done so long as simple operations are required.  However, of course Im expecting that sooner or later Im going to need to modify this project to achieve some customized behavior.p  pI could just modify the project and never look back, but Id be losing the tremendous advantage of being able to regenerate the project to add new tables and behaviors.  While I could generate a new project with my changes and apply those changes by hand, Id rather not have to do this for every change I need to make. p  pUnfortunately, the tool which generates this project cant be touched for reasons that its not our tool but a tool of a third party software company which produces project templates.  p  pI noticed that it heavily uses the Seam framework to instantiate generated classes using codeIncreate  truecode.  Is there anyway to extend a generated class such that regenerating existing classes wont override my changes, yet have these extended classes be instantiated insteadp  pIs there some strategy that I can use in order to minimize modification to generated classes ideal case would be to modify behavior simply by adding files to the project, though I realize that wouldnt be possible for xhtml files  Any help would be appreciated, though I realize that some changes must be made to the tool before this would be possible for example a factory.p

Negative 59767 pThis is a strange issue and not sure what is going on.  I am using IIS7 and .net 4.0 to being. p  pIt seemed to keep the session cookies from staying on the client after the browser was closed. Another strange this is that I can close the IE and open FireFox and the session is in there too. HOW IS THAT I am thinking it is how my environment is setup. I have the sessions set for InProc and using cookies in IIS. What is different in IIS7p  pUpdate I am using integrated mode for my app pool. I looked at an older site I created using .net 3.5 and iis6 running on Sever2003. I can log into the site and it creates the session variable for me. I then go to FireFox and open the same site. It requires me to log in my application will take you to your prfile if a session exists. If I then close IE and reopen IE, then go back to my site, it requires me to log in again. What is happening with iis7 and my current application, is quite odd. The only difference in how my session is pulled is that I am getting the variable while casting the current handler to the Page object PageHttpContext.Current.Handlerp  pUpdate well, I think i found where the issues is and it has to do with casting the HttpContext.Current.Handler to the current page object. I have a configuration file where I wanted to put a property so all other classes could reference a central point to grab the User session object I created. The HttpContext.Current.session was always null and someone had suggested casting the HttpContext.Current.Handler. I created a simple page that checks to see if a session varaible has been created and if not it creates it. Then I print out the value. When I close the browser, the session is GONE. So, that is working. The code I had origianlly in this message was really for the back button, but I am not in need of that thank for Andrew pointing that out. So I guess it is not clear why that session pulled from the Hnadler is always available until I speicifcally clear it.p

Negative 59767 pI have two ComboBoxes, A amp B, each bound to an Observable Collection. Each has a SelectionChanged trigger is attached which is intended to catch when the user changes a selection. The trigger passes the selection to a Command.p  pThe collections implement INotifyPropertyChanged in that, in the Setter of each, an NotifyPropertyChanged event is fired. This is needed in the MVVM approach to notify the UI the View that the ComboBoxs contents have changed.p  pThe two ComboBoxes are interdependent  changing the selection in A causes B to be repopulated with new items.p  pNow, the problem is that Bs SelectionChanged trigger fires in response to its collection being repopulated as well as the user changing a selection. Due to the complexity of the code in the Command this is a huge waste of resources.p  pI could in theory stop this by not raising the NotifyPropertyChanged event when Bs collection is set because, looking at the Call Stack, this is what seems to cause the SelectionChanged trigger to fire, however the MVVM approach depends on this to keep the UI refreshed.p  pAny suggestionsp

So my question should be, is there a way to do it  p  pI couldnt get the rounded corners and styles to apply properly on JSFiddle so I used pastebin, please copy the text a hrefhttppastebin.com8mSQ2MxD relnofollowherea into a plain html file and you should get the correct output similar to the picture above  please let me know if it looks different  the corners are square.p  pNote if you use IE to view the file and use the IE developer tools, there is an option to outline table cells which is really helpful for this.p

Im using JQuery to allow the addition of form fields on the fly, so I have to use arrays for the name field so I can collect the information from potentiall multiple fields that are the same.

Negative 59767 pIve a method test that does not have a clear assert expression. The returned tested value is a very long string that has to be inspected by a programmer to check if it is correct or not. For this reason, if the code executes without exceptions, Im calling Assert.Inconclusive.p  pHowever, if some kind of Exception is thrown, I want to call Assert.Fail with the exception message. Something like thisp  precode      [TestMethod]       public void Test                try              string toBeChecked  MethodToBeTested             the string is so particular that no clear             assertion can be made about it.

This is not what I want.p  pIs there a way to filter the exceptions, such as catching every exception but the Assertlike onesp  pIm using .NET framework 3.5SP1p

Negative 59767 pIve made a custom video player in as3. Everything works, but once a video has loaded and played through completely, if the user replays the video it continuously fires the NetStream.Buffer.Flush event until the video stops playing again by either ending or by the user hitting pause. It doesnt seem to effect anything negatively, but I would rather not have an event continuously firing in the background like that.p  pI cant find any documentation of this happening online anywhere.

Negative 59767 pSo Im running into a problem with my custom types, functions and attributes in Python.p  pWhen Im in Python, and I want to set an attribute on one of my custom types for example Vector4, my code gets a NULL for the codeconst char attributenamecode argument and yes, I am importing my module. p  pOddly enough, when I hard code the attribute name in my setter function, I get the errorp  pcodeSystemError error return without exception setcodep  pI do see the object getting created in Python and again in C, so I dont think thats the problem. I do return 1 if the setattro hook did successfully set the attribute in C, and I see the code getting called and setting the attribute on the C side. There are no errorsexceptions that are raised when the attribute is being set.p  pAdditionally, when I call a function on the instance of my class in Python, it calls the function set in codetpgetattrocode instead of checking the dictionary.p  pIm not entirely sure why, maybe its because Im setting a dictionary and putting my functions in there, instead of doing it via a codePyModuleDefcode array, thus functions arent being seen when codePyTypeReadycode is called.p  pDoes anyone have any idea why this might be happening Were using Python 3.2.p  hr  pRelevant p  pI have a base type codetpnewcode and codetpdealloccode and then I am creating derived types at runtime. The derived types have a dictionary, codetpbasecode, codetpgetattrocode and a codetpsetattrocode.p  pThis is how functions are bound to Python classtypesp  precodePyMethodDef newMethod newMethod.mldoc  newMethod.mlname  funcName newMethod.mlflags  METHVARARGS newMethod.mlmeth  pythonFunc  PyGeneralObj selfFake  PyObjectNewPyGeneralObj, ampMetaEngineType selfFakegtclassName  className selfFakegtfuncName  funcName PyINCREFPyObjectselfFake  PyObject func  PyCFunctionNewampnewMethod, PyObjectselfFake PyObject method  PyInstanceMethodNewfunc  ErrorIfmethod  NULL, Python Cannot create instance function. s,  funcName  ErrorIfPyDictSetItemclassObjgtmpyClassTypegttpdict,             PyReturnStrnewMethod.mlname, method  1,  Python Cannot create function in dictionary.

I then add the object to the module PyObject that Im given from codePyImportImportModulecode. I do append my main module to the runtime and initalize python and import my module.p  hr  pIf more informationcode is needed, I can post some more. I hope this makes sense, this is my first time posting on stackoverflow.p  pFor clarification, we want to have dynamic attributes that are completely resolved on the C side. And for functions, I want to be able to override the codePyObject selfcode argument so that I can get the string name of the function that needs to be called.p  pWe dont want to use third party librariesinterfaces like Boost, Cython and whatever.p
Negative 59767 pI have read a good bit on the limitations of sending html email from android.  All suggestions to send html email seem to be to just pass Html.fromHtmlyourHtmlString to the intent as Intent.EXTRATEXT.  This works for a few basic tags  bold, italic  but wont for anything like an html table.p  pIt looks like you could try to extend some of the functionality of either Html or implement your own taghandler, but I am wondering if there is not a more fundamental limitation that will force you to do something completely different like with the mail api or something.p  pThe reason I suggest this is because, as far as the intent itself knows, Html.fromHtmlblah is simply a charsequence, and if you call the methods on the charsequence interface on this object you dont see any html stuff at least I didnt.  All of the htmltag stuff seems to be wrapped up in the SpannableStringBuilder that Html.fromHtml actually returns... and I am wondering if the gmail app looks under the covers to see what the charsequence really is and then can handle a few tags, which means that there is no hope in doing anything on your apps side of things to gettrick the gmail app to handle anything more complicated than bold, italic, etc.p  pI have looked at the raw email the gmail app actually sends, and it automatically sends both a textplain with no tags, and the texthtml version with the limited number of tags.  I even tried sticking in some escaped html tags that might ultimately get converted to actual tags in the texthtml part of the email, but alas they stayed escaped... and that would of course be a bit hacky.p  pAnyway, for anyone who might have looked into this more, I wanted to do an additional confirmation that the default android send html email functionality will get you maddeningly close to what you might need, but in the end youve got to bite the bullet and implement a lot of lower level stuff yourself such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2020088sendingemailinandroidusingjavamailapiwithoutusingthedefaultandroidapSending Email in Android using JavaMail API without using the default android appBuiltin Email applicationa , which means youve got to deal with the pw stuff, etc.. p  pNote later I wrapped the SpannableStringBuilder returned from Html.fromHtml with a custom class that extended SpannableStringBuilder and passed that to the intent to listen for calls to the Spanned interface.  It turns out that when things are written to the parcel that is sent to the email intent, TextUtils.writeToParcel does some special checking to root out the bolditalic stuff by first checking if the CharSequence is an instance of Spanned, and then asking for the spans via spanned.getSpans.  Nevertheless, I see no obvious hope in making the modifications to get something as simple as tabletd tags handled in there.  And I even tried modifying the toString of my subclass of SpannableStringBuilder to return some raw table html to see what would happen, but it gets escaped somewhere else down there in the parcelwriting process.p  pAnd More Later  TextUtils.writeToParcelCharSequence cs, Parcel p,... will, if cs is an instance of Spanned, write those spans only if they implement the ParcelableSpan interface... which is A special kind of Parcelable for objects that will serve as text spans and can only be used by code in the framework it is not intended for applications to implement their own Parcelable spans.  So, even if you wanted to hook into this and write your own to handle table tags or whatever, it seems to be discouraged.  Man I wish hackbod would weigh in here with something obvious Ive missed.p

I can do this all in memory no files read from disk or net.p  pThe application will never instantiate more than one object of such a class. There will only be two or three references to that object. When the modified class is loaded and instantiated, all those references will be changed to the new object. I can also probably guarantee that no method in the affected class is running in another thread while loading the modified class.p  pMy question is this will my class loader have problems loading a modified class with the same name as a class it previously loadedp  pIf I do not explicitly implement a cache of loaded classes in the class loader, would that avoid problems Or could delegation to a parent class loader still cause a problemp  pI hope to use a single instance of my class loader, but if necessary, I could instantiate a new one each time I update a class.p  pNote I looked at OSGI and it seems to be quite a bit more than I need.p

Negative 59767 pIm working on developing a web portal for a bookstore, and I want to have the ability to suggest books to a user.p  pI want something similar to amazon.com, when a user orders book A, the system should provide a list of other suggested books.

Negative 59767 pI am seeing a problem when sending a file through Apache configured as proxy to a local application using the Mongoose webserver.p  pMy setupp  blockquote   pApache port 80 lt modproxy lt Mongoose port 9090p blockquote  pmodproxy is configured to transfer certain URLs from port 80 to localhost9090.p  pMongoose only accepts authenticated responses. This works OK for normal small requests. With large file transfers however Apache returns a 502 Bad Gateway response.p  pWhat happens well, actually just my analysis of what happens is that when our client a .net client, expect 100 enabled tries to send a file it sends the headers followed directly by the contents of the file.p  pMongoose receives the headers of the transfer, detects that it is not authenticated and returns a 401 Unauthorized and closes the connection. Now Apache which is still receiving and processing the file transfer  cannot forward the data any more and returns a 502 Bad Gateway The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.p  pWhen sniffing on the external interface I see that the .net client sends the headers, followed within 20 msec by the contents, without receiving a 100 Continue. When the receive is finished Apache returns the 502.p  pWhen sniffing the internal interface I see that the header and body are combined into one tcp packet of 16384 bytes. Mongoose replies within a few msecs with the 401 and closes the connection. p  pIt looks like Apache detects the close of the connection but ignores the 401 and does not forward this. Is there a possibility to have Apache correctly forward the 401 instead of replying with the 502p  pFor the moment I changed our application to just read all data from the connection if a 401 is detected, but this is just a workaround as this comes down to sending the complete file twice. As the files can be hundreds of megabytes this can give quite some stress on our system.p  pWe are using Apache 2.2.9 Debian on an ARM system.p

Negative 59767 pI have tried accomplish this using both FQL and the Graph API.p  pI began by trying this FQL callp  precodefql  SELECT pic, srcbig FROM photo WHERE pid IN SELECT pid FROM phototag WHERE subject  me codepre  pFrom this I receive results that include images containing a tag of the given user in this case me. However, these images may include more than one tagged user. I was hoping to work around this issue by using the SQL HAVING clause along with COUNT httpstackoverflow.coma37105011406986. Unfortunately I dont think FQL supports this functionality because when I attempted this callp  precodefql  SELECT pic, srcbig FROM photo WHERE pid IN SELECT pid FROM phototag HAVING COUNTsubject  1 codepre  pI recived an error from Facebook. Please correct me if FQL does in fact support this functionality.p  pIn attempt to tackle this using the Graph API I made the following requestp  precodeuserPics  facebookgtapimephotos codepre  pThis returns the users photos, however, from this point I was forced to iterate over every photo looking for ones that only contain one tag. I found this to be impractical if, for instance, I need to find an image for each of a users friends that only contains their friend and no others. To do this I would need to retrieve all of each of their friends photos individually and then iterate over all of them.p  pIm still searching for a good solution.

Negative 59767 pIm trying to make my own animated GUI with the help of Qt 4.8 on Windows. At the beginning i used the widgets and the Qt Designer to place a horizontalgridetc layout and put inside the normal widgets but I found that making them move with the animations framework is not really easy. So I switched to QGraphicsSceneQGraphicsView that seems much simpler to use with animations. I would make a simple menu where there are the main items that when hovered makes visible the submenu items. Something simple, thing about a dropdown horizontal menu. I placed the QGraphicsTextItem items but I still dont understand how could I connect the hover event of the main items to display the submenu items. Any idea At the moment I have a QMainWindow with a QGraphicsView widget that takes all the area.p

Negative 59767 pIn my project I am working with an array of objectsobject[] of a user decided length. It is also looped through at least a couple hundred times a second in the course of the application. This array also has a class associated with it that assures that any additions to it will fill the first open spot using an array that has a bit set for each occupied element. Once assigned array entries stay where they are as it would effect tracking of the elements to move them so gaps are possible.The number of elements that may be removed or added is unknown. Addition and removal happen much less frequently than the elements are looped through and accessed.p  pWhat I need to know is which would provide better average performance when looping though this array...p  ol liCheck each entry for nullli ol  porp  ol lipCall the following code to get the next index in a loop checking for the 1 to stop.

Negative 59767 pI am designing a program that has a codeJEditorPanecode where users can enter and compile Java code. They can then run their program in a new process, and then their output will be displayed in a codeJTextAreacode. I accomplish this by extending codeJTextAreacode and adding this as a memberp  precodeprivate OutputStream writer  new OutputStream      public void writeint b          Console.this.appendString.valueOfchar b       codepre  pI then have a simple codegetStreamcode method that returns this codeOutputStreamcode wrapped in a codePrintWritercode, and call codeSystem.setOutcode and codeSystem.setErrcode with the codePrintWritercode.p  pNow here comes the issue if the user compiles a program where a lot of output is sent to the Console at once e.g., infinite loop of codeSystem.out.printlncode calls, the entire GUI hangs.  I have attempted to fix this by using a codeSwingWorkercode to handle the codeappendcode calls but nothing seems to work.p  pIs there a way to keep the GUI responsive even if massive amounts of text are being written to the codeJTextAreacode Im assuming part of the issue is the amount of time time that is taken to update the GUI after an codeappendcode call.  Is there maybe a way to delay writing to the codeJTextAreacode by a small amount so that a user can click the button to terminate the processp

When I make a selection to book an event, the jQuery Dialog comes up and I use an ajax call to send the fields to a php script to process the data. p  pMy problem, however, comes from the UNIX timestamps used in fullcalendars start and end variables.

Negative 59767 pIm working in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio CLR registering .dlls into the database as assemblies.

There is some kind of bug in my code because I am getting exceptions from C related to deserialization and missing assemblies that I cant debug if I cant get my assemblies added properly.p

After much research on various forums and tutorial videos we have come to the realization that ASP.net MVC does not support a drag and drop design environment.p  pWe have investigated using code templates etc in ASP.net MVC and these definitely speed up constructing the view in code.

My App uses about 120MB of memory, which is fine, and there are no leaks at all, which I checked using Instruments. However when I run the routine a second time with a completely new instance of my image processing class after deleting the first of course the app crashes on my iPhone 4. It still works fine on my iPad 3. Whenever I call CGContextDrawImage is crashes. Obviously there is no exception thrown or anything the like. I really dont know why this is, since there should be enough memory available. Running it in Instruments on my iPad 3 shows that the never uses more than 120MB of memory.p  pPlease find the code which causes the crash below. Again, it only crashes when doing this a second time and only on my iPhone 4.p  precodeCGImageRef imageref  [image1 CGImage]     uint8t inBitmap1  uint8t  mallocvectorsizeI CGContextRef context1  CGBitmapContextCreateinBitmap1, width, height, bitsPerComponent, bytesPerRowI, colorSpace, kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst CGContextDrawImagecontext1, CGRectMakexOffset1, yOffset1, imwidth, imheight, imageref codepre

Negative 59767 pI am currently writing an application which is kind of a proxy between the enduser and a web service.  p  pThe user requests a service, and the application calls the web service method with appropriate parameters set, and returns the result.  p  pTo make sure nothing went wrong, I have decided to create unit tests for the project Yep I know its a bit late to do it emafterem writing the code. Ill write the unittests first next time.  p  pin these unit tests, I have to make real requests to the web service to be sure no permission exception, servicerelated exception, etc is raised. Therefore extracting an interface and mocking the service for testing is not going to help. Is it acceptable to write unit tests, that actually call the real web service  p  pIs it possible to have a delay between two tests if my web service just allows for example one request per minutep

Negative 59767 pI wanted to create a macro using excel 2003 for a group of excel files where I can aggregate only the data I need to see into one ss the only problem is that I have no idea where to start. I am using a directory at work where I save down about 1520 excel ss into a daily date labeled folder. To expedite our daily process of having to look into each ss, search for the correct tab which sometimes doesnt exist for that particular day in the workbook, sort by data filter, and check it against list of identification codes I would much rather create this in a macro. So I am looking for the macro to open todays dated folder in the directory, find the correct labeled tab lets call it NYK123, open each file to match the id codes in column H and department codes in column J against the table I have on the original ss, and display the results on the original ss. Also new issues have the entire rows font is red and need to be displayed in the original ss. Any help you guys can provide would be much appreciated.p

Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAnyone know if this is possibleeasier using another library such as SceneJSp

You need to find a node which contains graph itself and work only with this nodes coordinates, not axis or scene. I would even advise to add all mouse events to that node instead of scene to avoid excessive coordinates translation. Another advise would be use ScenicView tool to investigate your application and see which nodes has what coordinates and verify your math.emp  pstrongEdit 3strong These pictures may help in better explaining my issuep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoiD0m.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commIyix.png altenter image description herep

Negative 59767 pOur control system has a lot of data files that have specific versions. The data files are append only, so a higher version will always contain a superset of the definitions in the earlier versions.p  pIn order to avoid magic numbers in our code, we have created a code generator that take a piece of data and turns it into a C class file. I have a pretty large class library containing pretty much only such files. This results in much more readable code and some additional compiler checks because type previously risky type casting can now be part of the generated code, so that users of the library consume their correct subtypes directly. p  pHowever, the question comes up what data file version was used in the latest version of the class library.

Negative 59767 pBasically, I have a temp table and I am populating the table with the same data using different techniques in order to find the fastest one in my case. The three methods arep  ol liselect inserted information using joinsli liselect inserted information where most of the tableslogiccalculations are included in inline functionli liselect inserted information where most of the tableslogiccalculations are included in tablevalue functionli ol  pWith each method the table is populated with the same data and I get best performance using the table value function. But here the things comes strange.p  pAfter the temp table is populated a simple SELECT is done over it, with GROUP BY and ORDER BY on all columns. Because the data is the same I have expected same execution plans, but I get thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjJ7dT.png altenter image description herep  pWhere the first row is the execution plan of the tablevalue function and the second one is the execution plan for the first and the second method. p  pWhy I have two different executions plan for table with same data Why it is not always using the first one as it is faster then the the second onep  pNote, as this is connected with data being sorted and grouped by, I have supposed when I use the tablevalued function maybe the date is already sorted, but simple select of the results display that the data is sorted in the same way in each case.p

Negative 59767 pI am working on this new social networking site. One of its various functions is posting. You can post to Facebook and my site, or Twitter and my site. That being said, I couldnt help but try and post HTML as I was testing sql injection.

That being said, I want to make my site a safe environment for my users... not a site that is used to distribute computer viruses, porn, and other things that might make someone tend to stay off of my site. When I searched this topic, I found ways to strip the HTML out of the post variable before submitting it to the database. However, I would just like to make it so you can post any text, including HTML and Javascript, without the browser interpreting it as run this... code I want to display it as plane text. Ive seen it on Facebook, and when I looked at it the source code of a post, it showed lt, , and  as regular text. I tried dissecting Facebooks source code, but found nothing. I have tried using tags such as codeltpregtcode and codeltcodegtcode, but because of the lack of ability to style and control them, I gave up and went back to just allowing HTML. Please, anyone who knows how to do this, please help me out.p  pThanks in advance,p  pTPp

Negative 59767 pI am using the a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdroppable relnofollowJQuery UI droppablea library features, and I want to provide visual user feedback when they hover over a droppable target. For this I can easily use the codehoverClasscode option to specify which class to use when they have a draggable item hovering over.p  pBut what I want to do is use a different codehoverClasscode value depending on some logic.

Negative 59767 pLong before I started working here a developer wrote a web app in VB.Net in VS 2008 that included a link that creates a report, using Crystal Reports, as a PDF file.  It was reported by a user to me that the link generates an error.  I am not sure if this has always been a problem and it is just now being reported or if there was a change on the server.  This is an application that I have had little involvement with since I have been here and the developer who wrote it is long gone from the company.  I havent worked with Crystal Reports since the late 90s.  Anyway enough background here is the error.p  pI traced everthing right up to the objTemp.Export method call where objTemp is an instantiation of the Crystal Reports ReportClass class.p  pWhen I run the app locally on my machine in the Visual Studio IDE everything works exactly as it is supposed to.

Negative 59767 pThis is probably a pretty simple thing but my knowledge of direct x is just not up to par with what Im trying to achieve.p  pFor the moment I am trying to create a vehicle that moves around on terrain. I am attempting to make the vehicle recognize the terrain by creating a square 4 D3DXVECTOR3 points around the vehicle whos points each detect the height of the terrain and adjust the vehicle accordingly.p  pThe vehicle is a simple object derived from Microsoft sample code. It has a world matrix, coordinates, rotations etc.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is to make these points move along with the vehicle, turning when it does so they can detect the difference in height. This requires me to update the points each time the vehicle moves but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get them to rotate properly.p  pSo In summary I am looking for a simple way to rotate a vector about an origin my vehicles coordinates.p  pThese points are situated near the vehicle wheels so if it worked they would stay there regardless of the vehicles y axis rotation.p  pHeres What Ive tryedp  precodeD3DXVECTOR3 vec D3DXVec3TransformCoordampvectorToHoldTransformation,ampSquareTopLeftPoint,ampmatRotationY SquareTopLeftPoint  vec codepre  pThis resulted in the point spinning madly out of control and leaving the map.p  precodexRot  VehicleCoordinateX  cosRotationY  SquareTopleftX  VehicleCoordinateX  sinRotationY  SquareTopleftZ  VehicleCoordinateZ yRot  VehicleCoordinateZ  sinRotationY  SquareTopleftX  VehicleCoodinateX  cosRotationY  SquareToplefteZ  VehicleCoordinateZ codepre  pBoxPoint refers to the vector I am attempting to rotate. Vehicle is of course the origin of rotation RotationY is the amount it has rotated.p  pThis is the code for 1 of 4 vectors in this square but I assume once I get 1 write the rest are just copypaste.p  pNo matter what I try the point either does not move or spirals out of control under leaving the map alltogether.p  pHere is a snippet of my object classp  precodeclass Something  public     float x, y, z     float speed               float rx, ry, rz          float sx, sy, sz      float width     float length      float frameTime       D3DXVECTOR3 initVecDir     D3DXVECTOR3 currentVecDir      D3DXMATRIX       matAllRotations     D3DXMATRIX       matRotateX     D3DXMATRIX       matRotateY     D3DXMATRIX       matRotateZ     D3DXMATRIX       matTranslate     D3DXMATRIX       matWorld       D3DXMATRIX       matView                D3DXMATRIX       matProjection     D3DXMATRIX       matWorldViewProjection  these points represent a box that is used for collision with terrain.

Negative 59767 pIm new to blocks in iOS, and Im trying to figure out the correct way to use them. Heres my setupp  pI have a method codefoocode which returns whether an operation codeRKObjectRequestOperationcode succeeded or not. I provide the operation with a block for success and a block for failure, so in the success block I want codefoocode to return YES, and in the failure block I want codefoocode to return codeNOcode.p  pFor examplep  precode BOOL foo      RKObjectRequestOperation request  [[RKObjectRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequesturlRequest responseDescriptorsresponseDescriptors]      [request setCompletionBlockWithSuccessRKObjectRequestOperation operation, RKMappingResult mappingResult          NSLogSuccess          return YES      failureRKObjectRequestOperation operation , NSError error          NSLogFailure          return NO     ]      [request start]  codepre  pHowever, as far as I know, a block is only able to return its own value it cannot cause the method which is calling it to return. Is this correct If this is the case, the only thing I can think of is to have codefoocode take another block as a parameter which is called on success or on failure of the operation. The problem with this is that going up the call stack from foo, I would have to change any method with a return type to return void and accept a block as a parameter to call instead. It seems excessive to have to change all of those methods. Am I missing something conceptuallyp

Im not too sure if i have added these correctly as i have added some properties but i still have the same issue when i run the pagep  pCan someone please take a look and advisep  pHere is my full code...p  precodeImports Microsoft.VisualBasic Imports System.Text Imports System.Net.NetworkInformation Imports System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingReply   Partial Class Ping Inherits System.Web.UI.Page  Private mSend As PingReply  Private Property Sendp1 As String As PingReply     Get         Return mSend     End Get     Setvalue As PingReply         mSend  value     End Set End Property   Private mAddress As PingReply  Private Property Addressp2 As String As PingReply     Get         Return mAddress     End Get     Setvalue As PingReply         mAddress  value     End Set End Property  Private mStatus As PingReply  Private Property Statusp3 As String As PingReply     Get         Return mStatus     End Get     Setvalue As PingReply         mStatus  value     End Set End Property   Protected Sub btnPingClicksender As Object, e As System.EventArgs Handles btnPing.Click     Dim vPing As New Ping     Dim vPingReply As PingReply  vPing.Sendxxx.xx.xxx.xx     Console.WriteLineAddress 0, vPingReply.Address     Console.WriteLineStatus 0, vPingReply.Status End Sub  End Class codepre  pAny help is much appriechiated.p  pBetty.p
Negative 59767 pI have a question that appears to have been asked before, but, having browsed the responses, does not appear to have been answered satisfactorily. I am adding items to a table, essentially a series of textfields with ok  cancel buttons in a JFrame that adds data to a list that is displayed in another JFrame in a JTable. Nothing terribly complicated there. My question is, what is the best method to call the Refresh method that tells the JTable to repaint itself  revalidate itself Should I just use a public static method called from the JFrame that is doing the adding, or is there an Eventlike option in Java that would work better Your thoughts p

Negative 59767 pIm currently making a program that has 4 players taking turns tossing 3 coins. The first player to earn 16 points wins. A player earns points each time he tosses the coins. The number of points he earns equals to the number of heads he tosses. If he tosses strongno heads then he loses his next turnstrong. If he flips 3 heads then he earns an extra turn and tosses the coins again. If he tosses less than 3 heads then it is the next players turn. A player must earn exactly 16 points to win. If a player has 14 points and tosses 2 heads then he wins but if he tosses n heads and stronggoes over 16 points then he loses half of his points and loses his turn too.strong He must have exactly 16 points to win. p  pHow do I get the player to be skipped for the next turn Each player currently goes in order. Ex. Tom, Hank, Hannah, Tina. If hank rolls 0 heads or goes over 16 points he should lose he next turn making the order Tom, Hannah, Tina, Tom, Hank, Hannah, Tina.

Negative 59767 pUpon a given event, I wish to trigger a given action.  In particular, I would like to hide an editor by performing codetinymce.editors[myID].hidecode.  Turns out this method is only available within the codesetbackcode callback function.  Why this is so, I have no idea, but people much smarter than me say it is true as discussed in  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16590419javascriptobjectpropertiesaresometimesundefinedJavaScript object properties are quotsometimesquot undefineda.p  pOne way to do this is to add the following script in the codesetupcode callback function.p  precodehide1.clickfunctiontinymce.editors[myID].hide codepre  pWhile this will work, my realworld example is a little more complicated.  The event will start with a click, then do an ajax call, and based on the returned JSON, will do some other work and may or may not hide the editor.  I really dont want to duplicate all the logicajax both inside codesetupcode and in other parts of the application.  Instead, I am hoping I can put the logicajax outside of codesetupcode and use it to somehow trigger codetinymce.editors[myID].hidecode which is located in codesetupcode.p  pI hope this makes sense to you, because it is pretty confusion to me.p  pLive Example a hrefhttpjsbin.comogirab3 relnofollowhttpjsbin.comogirab3a  With Code a hrefhttpjsbin.comogirab3edit relnofollowhttpjsbin.comogirab3editap  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt      ltheadgt          ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetISO88591 gt          lttitlegtTestinglttitlegt       ltheadgt      ltbodygt         ltformgt             lttextarea idmyIDgtlttextareagt         ltformgt         ltbutton idhide1gtHide using event linked directly in setupltbuttongt         ltbutton idhide2gtHide by mimicing an eventltbuttongt         ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquerylatest.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt         ltscript srchttptinymce.cachefly.net4.0tinymce.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascriptgt              function                 tinymce.init                     selector myID,                     setup    functione                          hide1.clickfunctiontinymce.editors[myID].hide                                                       hide2.clickfunctionalerttrigger event which will cause function in tinymcesetup to trigger.                      ltscriptgt     ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre

I see on the console that that the new option is captured in the javascript and ajax makes a post, but the post array is empty.  p  pMy code is all in the view.  When an add new is selected a modal window pops up in which text can be entered.  I want to capture the entered text in the view without submitting and display it in the updated options list.p  precode                  ltlegendgtAnimal Infoltlegendgt                      ltdiv classcontrolgroup ltphp if formerroranimalspecies  echo error  gtgt                         ltlabel classcontrollabelgtSpeciesltlabelgt                                     ltdiv classcontrolsgt                              ltphp                                                    Add Add New                             options  species  arrayaddnew gt Add New                              echo formdropdownanimalspecies, options,                                                 setvalueanimalspecies, issetmydatagtanimalspecies  mydatagtanimalspecies ,                                                 id  animalspecies,                                                 class, addnew                             echo formerroranimalspecies, ltspan classhelpinlinegt, ltspangt                                                             gt                           ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                                           ltphp                     ifissetnewoption                                        newoption  POST[newoption]                     species  arraynewoption gt newoption  species                     vardumpnewoption                                  gt    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt        uploadform option[valueaddnew].clickfunction             Show modal window           addnew.modalshow            addnewsubmit.onclick, function                 Get new option from text field               var newoption  addnewtext.val               console.lognewoption                .ajax                     type POST,                     url ltphp echo siteurl gtmainuploadpage,                     data newoptionnewoption                   .failfunction jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown                         console.errorThe following error occured   textStatus, errorThrown                                   addnew.modaltoggle                                                                                ltscriptgt    lt addnew field gt   ltdiv classmodal small hide fade idaddnew tabindex1 roledialog arialabelledbyaddnewfieldLabel ariahiddentruegt       ltdiv classmodalheadergt         ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissmodal ariahiddentruegtltbuttongt         lth3 idaddnewfieldLabelgtAdd New Fieldlth3gt       ltdivgt       ltdiv classmodalbodygt            ltpgtWould you like to add a new itemltpgt           ltinput typetext idaddnewtext nameaddnew placeholderType the new optiongt        ltdivgt        ltdiv classmodalfootergt         ltbutton typebutton classbtn btnsuccess idaddnewsubmit nameaddnewsubmitgtAddltbuttongt       ltdivgt   ltdivgtlt addnew field gt codepre  pRight now the string newoptions gets captured in the console but is NULL in the php, so ajax isnt posting for some reason.

Negative 59767 pI created a simple random phrase generator, which adds the phrase to an empty div each time a user clicks a generate button. Each click results in the the phrase being regenerated. That part works like a charm.p  pI wanted to display the last 5 phrases that each specific person generated not what the last 5 users to the site generated. That is, display the results of the last five phrases generated each time that user clicked the generate button.p  pI figured perhaps incorrectly that the emsimplestem way to do this was to create a cookie for each phrase generated and then just display the content of each of those cookies.p  pSo, I found a a hrefhttpsgithub.comcarhartljquerycookie relnofollowjquery.cookie plugina, which I managed to get working and create a cookie when someone clicks the button using thisp  precodedocument.readyfunction button.clickfunction   .cookiecookie1, phrasehere.text,  expires 7    codepre  pThe problem is that I want to store the last five phrases.  Using the above, each click overwrites the cookie. So, I thought something like this would workp  precodeif.cookiecookie1  null  document.readyfunction button.clickfunction   .cookiecookie1, phrasehere.text,  expires 7     else button.clickfunction   .cookiecookie2, phrasehere.text,  expires 7    codepre  pBut heres whats happening. I click the button, cookie1 is set with the text in the div phrasehere. If I click the button again, cookie1 gets changed to the new phrase in the phrasehere div. I thought my statement above would do a check to see if cookie1 exists and if so, then create a new, different cookie cookie2. If I click the button and reload the page, cookie1 is still set. But then if I click the button, it sets cookie2 and not cookie1. Not sure why the page reload is necessary to cause this behavior which is what I want.p  pUltimately, I want to store 5 cookies using the same logic that if there isnt a cookie then create one. After there are 5, then overwrite cookie1. Not sure what do after that though, as I dont think I can write something that would then overwrite cookie2.p  pClearly, there is a better way to do this. Trying to avoid using a database and do it all in the browser. I know this limits whats possible and wont work for everyone, but thats okay. Just an experiment for now.p  pIm open to using JavaScript, jQuery, or if necessary, PHP. Im just not sure how best to do it. Hope the question makes sense.p  pUPDATE a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17570253989722This codea works well to create the five cookies without overwriting. The trick now is how to overwrite the first cookie once five have been created and then overwrite the second and so on.p

Negative 59767 pI have been using CI for two years now. One thing that really annoys me is the use of codeampgetinstancecode. Although it is halpful while we are inside library , helper , presenters , model etc. But everytime loading it is cumborsome. If you forget loading it somewhere and simply use codethisgtblahgtblahcode instead of codeCIgtblahgtblahcode this makes too much trouble and if you are working online you face the client who is complaining that he sees the error. I have seen in the codelaravelcode that you does not need to load the codeinstancecode anywhere throughout the application. This is because codelaravelcode is codeautoloadingcode all the libraries and models and both are available anywhere in the application. But this seems to me disadvantage why loading classes that are not required in some particular places. This tells me Codeigniter is flexible but still i want an alternative where i dont want to use codeampgetinstancecode. Any idea or suggestion  Please.p

Negative 59767 pIve got a wpf user control project set up similar for the most part to the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd419663.aspx relnofollowWPF Apps With The ModelViewViewModel Design Pattern articlea. Basically, I have a headered content control, that houses a tab control. The first tab holds search results and any additional tabs are opened by clicking on an item from the search results to see a more detailed view of the item.p  pMy main problem is that I reuse the search results tab any time someone types in search criteria and runs the search command. The scrollviewer does not scroll to the top when the search results collection is repopulated if the user had scrolled down the list.p  pOriginally I was repopulating the search result item collection in a way that caused the CollectionChanged event to fire. Then I looked into using an attached property to allow scrolling to the top and it looked as if replacing the entire collection was the way to go since ItemsControl does not implement the ICollectionNotifyChanged interface. p  pSo I made the change and all seemed well. Running a new search replaced the search results item collection, which fired the attached property and scrolled the listview back to the top. However, I now have a problem that strongwhenever I move to another tabstrong to view a detailed view of an item, strongit fires the attached property and scrolls the search results on the first tab to the topstrong.

Where each cell shows in how many distinct decisions a particular opponent defined by row header was attacked by a particular suitor column header  All diagonal cells equal ZERO a party cant attack itself and table is not symmetric.p  pstrongI have triedstrong p  pto apply to the  first cell and than expandp  pCOUNTIFSFixed range of all opponents B2D6,the wanted opponent value  A2,   Fixed range of all suitors E2H6, the wanted suitor value  B1p  pI had an error. I figured out that criteria ranges have to be of the same size. OK, created dummy empty columns  no error, BUT, the results are clearly underestimated. I think that there is a match only if opponent and suitor have the same number. In details For each row excel tests the opponent1 and suitor1 towards corresponding values, then opponent2 and suitor2, then opponent3 and suitor3...  This actually explains why the ranges have to be of the same size.p  pstrongSo, What I would needstrongp  pIs, for each row, to make excel test all opponents towards the wanted opponent value, test all suitor towards the wanted suitor value.

Negative 59767 pI have heard a lot of rules of thumb about when a class should be decomposed e.g. your class is getting unmanageably large, but I dont know of a concrete answer to this question.  p  pI am not looking for a best practice or code smells.  For example, if I see duplicated code, I know there is one specific solution Eliminate the duplicate code by creating a base class or other creating a single method that both can use. This is a example of concrete, specific answer that I am looking for.p  pBut it is not so clear to me when a class should be decomposed into two or more classes.  I can tell you my rule of thumb is that when I see more than one broad responsibility, then I refactor out one of the responsibilities.  But this is more of a best practice and I would like to nail this down more exactly.  p  pThe closest I have found is the Single Responsibility Principle.  The single responsibility principle states that every object should have a single responsibility.  But what is a responsibility How do define that exactly p  pBob Martin says its a reason to change. To take a concrete example, lets say you have an app which takes an input, processes it and creates an output.  That would make three areas of change  Input  It could be from a string, or XML.  The Processor could change in its rules.  And the output could change It could be string or XML or database. So it would give you three classes at the top level.p  pAgain, not looking for debate or best practice, but if there is a solid principle of decomposition.  Or perhaps, a solid principle of composition would be a better way of stating it.p  pThe motivation for me behind decomposition is composition  I have found highly composed apps are much more flexible and easy to work with.  p  pAnother reason for decomposition is so that I, as a developer, by just looking at the classes, can better understand the whole application.  To have a clear understanding of a class I suppose would require the class has a single clear cut purpose. While this has to do with class naming, I think that if a class has such a purpose, it would be the most understandable and thus be a good basis for decomposition.  p  pTo apply this to the example above, it would be obvious where to look if I needed to do maintenance on the Input, Processing, or Output, I start at the obvious class as each has an obvious purpose. But I am just thinking out loud here to try to clarify it for myself. p  pSo the question is What is the benefit of decomposition and what indicates a class should be decomposed p

Negative 59767 pThere is a multimillion record database in MS SQL Server 2008 R2 under Windows XP SP3.p  pMy coworker has written a .Net application, which directly connects to this db and runs a reasonable amount of queries. I dont know .Net, but Im sure this app does not connect to DB using ODBC. p  pOn the other hand Ive written a commandline python CPython version 2.7.5 application, which connects to this database and runs simple queries on it to send the data over internet to somewhere else. Database connection is made using pyodbc 3.0.7 installer from a hrefhttpwww.lfd.uci.edugohlkepythonlibs relnofollowhttpwww.lfd.uci.edugohlkepythonlibsa and a DSN which uses codeSQL Server Native Client 10.0code driver. Ive tried both disabling and enabling connection pools for this driver in codeConnection Poolingcode tab of windows codeData Sources ODBCcode applet. The script sends 100 records from the db and then closes the connection and sleeps for 2 minutes and then runs again.p  pBoth of these programs run constantly on the same machine as db.p  pThe question is the .Net app runs nicely when I remove the defined DSN  and of course the python script is not running. When I define the DSN again and start the python script to run side by side .Net app, there is no problem for roughly 5 hours. but then gradually while python script is mostly fine, the .Net app starts to get timeouts from the db.p  pWhat could go wrong that this happensp  pEDITp  ppython script which connects using ODBC runs fine, all the time. but .Net app falls behind of usual performance after couple of hours. When I close the python script, .Net app still stays behind. but when I remove the ODBC DSN which I defined for python script, .Net app goes back to normal performance. Its very strange. As I said I dont know anything about .Net, so this could be result of nonstandard code on the part of .Net app, maybe open transactions, locks, too many connections, etc. To make the case stranger, cutting database size to half by deleting records and rebuilding indexes, seems to have solved the .Net app issue so far.p  pEDIT 2p  pThe only two queries that python script runs, arep  precodeSELECT TOP 100 FROM tbldata WHERE id gt  ORDER BY id codepre  pandp  precodeSELECT  FROM tbldata WHERE id   codepre  pThe first query usually only runs once in each run of the python script. The second one runs at most 100 times. codeidcode is primary key, and so is indexed. As you can see the queries could not be simpler. For the first query I read the entire result set in the program to not keep a cursor open on DB server. Also Ive turned off connection pooling in ODBC applet for the driver Im using, so after each run of the script, DB connection should have been disposed and all resources on DB server should have been freed. The script sleeps for 2 minutes and then repeats this.p  pThe queries that .Net app runs are far more complex, combined with some triggers on the database. And the strange thing is it runs mostly fine, on itself. but when DSN is defined, it starts to get long waits on a single insert statement, which sometimes results in timeout.p  pAlso I should have said that Windows and MSSQL are not updated with latest patches from microsoft, so if its a bug in ODBC driver or MSSQL itself, it could have been already solved for others.p  pEDIT 3p  pTable is clustered on PK index. the data table contains about 1.5M records now. DB size is about 160GB. Server does not have a high spec. Intel Core i7 2600, 4GB RAM, plain 1TB SATA disk drive.p

Negative 59767 pI have a layout of boxes that are all floated left and when you click on their headings, they slide open revealing content. The issue is that the way floats work, when you click to expand one of them, it messes with the row underneath.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netFCCye relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netFCCyea lt click on one of the headings to see the issue.p  pIve solved this by separating them into columns like sop  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcaW4M relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcaW4Map  pThat works fine, however, the layout needs to be responsive, so when the window is 480 or lower, it needs to be 1 column. Between 480 and 768 it needs to be 2 columns. Anything above 768, 3 columns. obviously, the jsfiddles dont show the breakpoints I have set up.p  pThis is the code Ive come up with to solve this, however it is not working at all.

So my thought is that at the different sizes, I would have to pull all of the boxes out of the columns, delete the columns, and reappend the columns in different numbers based on the window width. This has proved to be a failed attempt, so if anyone can explain to me what Im doing wrong I would be very appreciativep  pThanksp

Negative 59767 pIm in the process of moving from svn to git, and Im wondering how to manage our local development webservers along with the new git system.p  pRight now, a developer can have multiple checkouts of the development branch.  Each of those checkout directories are mapped to the webserver with various virtual hosts.p  pFor instance, developer bob may have 3 checkouts of dev for various tickets.  Each of those checkouts have their own virtual host bob.dev1.localhost, bob.dev2.localhost, and bob.dev3.localhost.p  pWhen theyre done with a ticket, theyll mark down on the ticket the host the changes reside on and move the ticket over to QA.  That seems relatively straight forward.p  pNow, with git, having multiple checkout directories doesnt make sense.  The dev can just branch the development branch and work on a clean slate, and just checkout a different branch whenever they need to change gears.p  pIs there a way to have the local dev websevers point to specific local git checkouts  For instance the developer makes a new branch, makes their changes, and then passes the branch name as part of host, and then whenever someone hits the webserver, the local branch is checked out if its not already, and we can pass QA Urls specific to tickets  For example bob.branch1.localhost, bob.branch2.localhost.p  pIf none of this makes any sense, I wouldnt be surprised.  If you have any suggestions on how to do this based on your own development workflow, Id love to hear it.p

Negative 59767 pI have multiple sets of arrays that contain additional arrays that have values attached that I use for figuring out math.

Negative 59767 pIm developing a site that requires a log in.  I have setup index.php to check if the client is logged in with a session cookie if not, it redirects to login.php that handles the login logic.  When the user enters their credentials into the login form, it posts to login.php which does the authentication.  If its okay, it should redirect back to index.php which does most of the work.  This whole setup works perfectly well in Internet Explorer 10 and Chrome 30.  However, in Firefox 24, the initial redirect from index.php to login.php works just fine, but not the redirect from login.php to index.php all I get is a blank page.  The weird part is, though, that if I try to view page source in Firefox, I get document expired in the code view window.  When I click try again, the source code pops up as if it had successfully redirected to index.php.p  pIm pretty sure this is not a phantom whitespace problem because it works in Chrome and IE, and it did work in a previous Firefox not to mention that it works if viewing the page source.

Negative 59767 pI am trying to improve the capture performance of a realtime computer vision program that I am developing to run on an embedded Linux computer using OpenCV. I would like to use multiple threads and a shared memory buffer to separate the tasks of 1 capturing video frames and 2 processing them a producerconsumer problem, I believe. I have read up on pthreads, mutex variables, and condition variables but do not understand how they would need to be used with the codeselectcode function.p  pRight now, video frames are captured using code adapted from the a hrefhttplinuxtv.orgdownloadsv4ldvbapiscaptureexample.html relnofollowVideo4Linux2 Video Capture Examplea which makes use of codeselectcode. As I understand it, codeselectcode blocks the program until data is available from the webcam, which can be slow and a major waste of time. If possible, I would like to use those wasted CPU cycles to work on image processing. Of course this means that processing would always have to be done on an image that is stale by one frame, but at 30 fps it will be practically realtime anyways.p  pI have found some a hrefhttpcs.gmu.eduwhiteCS571ExamplesPthreadpcfive.c relnofollowexample codea that uses codepthreadmutexlockcode and codepthreadmutexcontrolcode to protect shared data, but strongit seems that these would still block the processing thread from running while waiting for image data via codeselectcodestrong. To be more concrete, here is some pseudo code to illustrate my concern. NOTE I realize that these threads would need to contain loops and other checks like the above linked example to actually work properly.p  precodevoid capture      pthreadmutexlockampmutex              protect shared data     pthreadcondwaitampspaceavail,ampmutex  make sure the buffer has room        capture code...       selectfd1, ampfds, NULL, NULL, amptv   waiting for data...

Negative 59767 pWhat are the best practices to structure big android databases From what Ive seen so far doing some research on this topic, Ive seen that most people are using a DatabaseHelper, which extends SQLiteOpenHelper. Does this also apply when you have multiple tables p  pFor example, in my current project, I have about 30 tables. So far, all of my tables are being created in my DatabaseHelper class, which currently is getting pretty huge. For every module, I also have a classSource class, which has all the CRUD methods in that module, and is using a singleton instance of my DatabaseHelper class. p  pSomehow it feels unnatural to have all of that code in my DatabaseHelper class. Have I done it the right way, or are there some better way to do this p

Negative 59767 pSo lets say I have 2 objects. One with the sprite of a circle, other with the sprite of triangle. My triangle object is set to the position of mouse in every step of the game, while circle is either standing in place or just moving in its own way, whatever. What I want to do is to have the TRIANGLE move around the circle, but not on its own, rather on the way your cursor is positioned.p  pSo basically, calculate degree between circles center and triangles center. Whenever they are far from each other I just set triangle position to mouse position, BUT when you hover your mouse too close past some X distance you cant get any closer the TRIANGLE is then positioned at maximum that X distance in the direction from circle center to mouse pointp  pIll add a picture and hopefully you can get what I mean. a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu23334107help2.png relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu23334107help2.pngap

Negative 59767 pI have a serial queue created as followsp  precodeself.myQueue  dispatchqueuecreatecom.myDomain.myQueue, DISPATCHQUEUESERIAL codepre  pI have an sqlite3 database to store up my data. Instead of committing this data every time, each time I get a piece of data, I store it up in a buffer  in this case, a lower level CPPbased vector.p  pI add blocks onto my private queue to write to the buffer. I use dispatchasync to do this. After a predefined time interval I commit data to the DB from the buffer.p  pWhen the DBs are below 5MB, things work as expected  each data comes in, each is written to the buffer, after the time interval expires, the data is committed to the DB from the buffer.p  pWhen the DB size increases to above 5 MB approx., the blocks on the queue seem not to execute until the time interval for committing data to the DB. When this time is done, one record is written to the buffer. The next time, the time interval expires, data is committed to the DB and again only one record is written to the buffer  this time a different record which is in the sequence i expect the records to come in. It seems like each block is executed only after I have written to the DB which happens only each time I am at the defined time interval.p  pNote I have checked that these blocks that do execute, execute cleanly  without errors.p  pI cant understand the link here between the size of the DB and the nonexecution if there is such a word of the blocks on the private queue.p  pDoes thread width of he private queue have anything to do with it Or memory concerns I would say the size of the DB, but it seems like the everytimeintervalblocks execute correctly. Also, I would say DB size directly, but Im not able to write to the buffer itself.p  pAny thoughts to give me direction OR is this an OS issue out of my controlp

Negative 59767 pI am still struggling with getting a chain of deferred promises working on a Visual Web Part.  The end goal is to change the colour of some DIV tags to colours referenced in a SPList.  p  pI originally had this code working with a single request to lookup data from a list, but I am now looking for a chain of requests.  The first is finding name of the Sub Site from the window.location.href property.  Although this code is retrieving the sub site name thinking about this as if type this might be my first mistake and perhaps I should be getting this from the SPWeb object instead.  The second then uses this value in a where clause to retrieve the correct data from the second call to a different list.p  pSo the code if have at the moment works, but is intermittent.  I think Im not calling .resolve in the correct place, and it is just luck as to if the async code has completed before the calling thread uses the expected result.

Negative 59767 pI have a couple of OptionGroups with very long captions that run across the width of the page, which looks very bad. I tried restricting the width of the OptionGroup using setWidth and via CSS, and also tried restricting the width of the parent container all without effect.p  pSo I made a grid layout with an option group in the first column spanning all rows, and individual labels for the captions in the second column one per row. However, in case the captions span multiple lines which they do in my case, this leads to the radio buttons  checkboxes no longer being aligned to the captions. Regrettably, Im not allowed to post images. For instance, p  po This is a multilinebr   o captionbr  nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspThis is another multilinebr  nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspcaptionp  pI resolved this by creating one OptionGroup per label, and adding each option group in the first columnp  po This is a multilinebr   nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspcaptionbr  o This is another multilinebr  nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspcaptionp  pClearly, in case of radio buttons, this means multiple buttons can be selected at the same time, since they are no longer linked via a single OptionGroup. Therefore, I registered listeners which, each time a button is selected, deselect all other buttons. And this brings me to my problem since this unchecking is done at the server side, there will unavoidably be some lag, meaning that for some time, multiple radio buttons will appear selected at the client side.p  pAny ideas on how to resolve this I only started working with Vaadin recently, so Im far from an expert. Is there some simple way of restricting the caption width some magical undocumented CSS class, or do I need to extend  adapt the clientside widget implementationp  pThanks,p  pWilliamp

I initiated the retrieval, but the download took  24 hours and at the end, I got a 403 since the resource was no longer available and the download failed.p  pIf I archived straight from my server to Glacier skipping S3, is it possible to initiate a restore that restores an archive to an S3 bucket so I can take longer than 24 hours to download a copy  I didnt see anything in either the S3 or Glacier Boto docs.p  pIdeally Id do this with Boto but would be open to other scriptable options.

Negative 59767 pI have a web application spread across multiple modules in different JSP pages. Currently I use different oracle connection objects across these pages due to scope limitations. I now need to rollback database transactions done on any of the JSP pages in a central JSP display page on button click. But database rollback requires an associated connection object.p  pI thought of maintaining only one connection object, adding it to the list of session variables and dereferencing it when needed. By doing this, I can rollback database transactions done in any page from the central display page. Kindly let me know if the above is feasible. p

Negative 59767 pLet X be an mn m number of records, and n number of attributes dataset. When the number of attributes n is large and the dataset X is noisy, classification gets more complicated and the classification accuracy decreases. One way to over come this problem is to use linear transformation, i.e., perform classification on YXR, where R is an np matrix, and pltn. I was wondering how linear transformation simplifies classification and why classification accuracy increases if we do classification on the transformed data Y when X is noisyp

Secondly I laid out these views using codeUIViewcode but it also failed because emthe Date rowem was pure codeUIViewcode not codeUIControlcode. So, I cant connect this view with my codeUIViewControllercode via targetaction. And I cant achieve this design using codeUIButtoncode because of some alignments. Lastly, I tried to use codeUICollectionViewcode. I think its best way but it doesnt support emstatic cellem . It means, I should produce these cells on the codeUIViewControllercode What a ungraceful solution. Is there any good way to resolve this problemp

My lexer incorrectly recognizes the following tokensp  ol licodefoocode identifierli licodecode symbolli licode42code integer literalli licodebarcode identifierli ol  pOnce the lexer sees the digit code4code, it keeps reading until it encounters a nondigit.

Negative 59767 pIm using Rails 2, and I have a onetomany association between the codeProjectcode model and the codeSchedulecode model in this app.p  pI have an observer check when attributes of various things change, and in response, it iterates over an array of hashes with which to populate new codeSchedulecode instances.p  pEach codeSchedulecode instance should have an attribute, codedispordercode, which eventually tells the front end where to display it when showing them in a list. The codedispordercode is populated upon adding the schedule to the project, so that it equals one more than the current highest codedispordercode.p  pThe problem is in the iteration in the observer. When I iterate over the array of hashes filled with codeSchedulecode data, each time through the iteration should calculate the codedispordercode as one higher than the previous one, to account for the codeSchedulecode it just added.

Negative 59767 pIt appears that there is a common failure that happens when Cordova apps are put in the background to use the Camera or Media Capture plugins... the Android activity service appears to look for memory to free up and kills the Cordova activity, so that when the user completes the capture task the app RESTARTS.

I am using Cordova 3.3 and a somewhat older version of the Capture plugin as an upgrade a month ago caused breaking changes and I rolled back.  Anyway, it appears that at some point someone created a custom plugin called foreground camera that never allowed the app to go into onStop state, which fixed the problemp  pa hrefhttpscode.google.compforegroundcamerapluginhttpscode.google.compforegroundcamerapluginap  pUnfortunately, this custom plugin is horribly out of date Cordova 2.4.

Negative 59767 pI have a voip app, but it wont wake up from standby mode when a call comes in. The docs say the following  p  precodeThere are several requirements for implementing a VoIP app   1. Enable the Voice over IP background mode for your app. Because VoIP     apps involve audio content, it is recommended that you also enable     the Audio and AirPlay background mode. You enable background modes     in the Capabilities tab of your Xcode project.   I did this using the capabilities tab in the projects settings.     I have audio and airplay, voice over ip,     background fetch and remote notifications checked.   2. Configure one of the apps sockets for VoIP usage.   I have 2 sockets, one for sending stuff to the server that closes after sending.     One socket that stays alive all the time, which is used to     receive stuff from the server.     The one that stays alive is configured as voip.   3. Before moving to the background, call the     setKeepAliveTimeouthandler method to install a handler to be     executed periodically. Your app can use this handler to maintain its     service connection.   I did this and in the handler I send a login message to the server,     On the server side its detected that the account is already logged in so     it refreshes the connection instead.   4. Configure your audio session to handle transitions to and from active use.     I did not do this yet, I might in the future.   5. To ensure a better user experience on iPhone, use the Core Telephony     framework to adjust your behavior in relation to cellbased phone     calls see Core Telephony Framework Reference.   I did not do this and probably never will companys decision, not mine.   6. To ensure good performance for your VoIP app, use the System     Configuration framework to detect network changes and allow your app     to sleep as much as possible.   I dont do this yet, but will implement it once all the basics run fine. codepre  pWhen a call comes in I create a local notification to let the user know about the call. When the app is minimized this works fine, but when the device is in standby sleep there is no notification. When I wake the device from standby, the notification pops up after a few seconds so its not already there, it really appears after waking up the device.  p  pI created more voip apps in the past, and I cant remember ever having trouble with this. Im running ios 8 now, perhaps I have to do some more to make it work while in standby Are there more requirements for voip now Or am I missing something stupid  p  pNote I know about push notifications. They are an option in fact, I already tested and they make it work, but Id rather not be dependent on the apns.p

Another computed observable query is a summary of a, b, and c.p  pIf I manually subscribe to query with the intention of loading some data, but first check allTrue, allTrue may not yet be updated and correct, because the procedure to update its value happens after the callback fires.p  pFor example, check a, then b, then c and the callback is called before the computed allTrue is calculated.p  pstrongIs what I am trying to do abnormal, or is there a way to get it to workstrongp  pPerhaps there is no advantage to using a computed, and indeed, if I replace it with a normal function isValid I get the behaviour I expect. But I intend to have other things react to the allTrueisValid value, and I thought I would usually use a computed in such scenarios a normal function would also work, but I thought there would usually be advantages to using a computed there.p

Negative 59767 pIn my scenario, I have a class that will do some work for me every now and then and occasionally will react with some action to it. What the action actually is will be provided from the outside. I think its important to mention, that there will be only emoneem instance from the outside telling this class what has to be done.p  pIve implemented something like thisp  precodepublic class DelegatePublisher      private Actionltbyte[], int, intgt onCompleted      public DelegatePublisherActionltbyte[], int, intgt onCompleted              this.onCompleted  onCompleted           public void Invokebyte[] buffer, int index, int count              onCompleted.Invokebuffer, index, count       codepre  pThis can be used later as simple asp  precodepublic class Example      public void Test              var byAction  new DelegatePublisheronDelegate           private void onDelegatebyte[] buffer, int index, int count               do stuff       codepre  pOnce codeInvokecode will be called the action will be called. I left out all that codenullcode checking on purpose for the sake of this minimal examplep  pThis works as expected and I am happy with that solution. However, people keep telling me that I should use codeEventscode. I told them that I just need a emsingleem codeActioncode to be invoked, and the code does it perfectly fine. After a long discussion, the code now looks like thisp  precodepublic class EventPublisher      public EventHandlerltEventPublisherEventArgsgt OnCompleted      public void Invokebyte[] buffer, int index, int count              var handler  OnCompleted         if handler  null                      handlerthis, new EventPublisherEventArgsbuffer, index, count                codepre  pAnd of course the codeEventArgscodep  precodepublic class EventPublisherEventArgs  EventArgs      public byte[] Buffer              get         private set           public int Index              get         private set           public int Count              get         private set           public EventPublisherEventArgsbyte[] buffer, int index, int count              Buffer  buffer         Index  index         Count  count       codepre  pMy ... well, calling code now looks like thisp  precodepublic class Example      public void Test              var byEvent  new EventPublisher         byEvent.OnCompleted  onEvent           private void onEventobject sender, EventPublisherEventArgs e               do stuff       codepre  pIs there actually any benefit in doing it as an codeEventcode Or the other way around Is there something wrong with the way using an codeActioncodep  pAll I can tell by using codeEventscode is that I need more code, have an extra layer of abstraction, could potentially connect multiple not needed callbacks and need an extra class just to hold three parameters. The only good thing I see is that I am following a common pattern. However, I have seen lots of code with passing an action as parameter, even in the BCL, which could probably be solved with events as well.p

It returned over half of the collection.p  p3 codedb.user.findtransactionelemMatchproductmobile, firstTransactionin[ISODate20150101,ISODate20150102].explaincodep  pThis is the main query which I want to be performant. But to my bad luck this query takes more than 30 mins to perform. I tried many versions of it such as thisp  pcodedb.user.findtransactionelemMatchproductmobile.mintransactionelemMatchfirstTransactionISODate20150101.maxtransactionelemMatchfirstTransactionISODate20150102.explain codep  pThis query gave me errorp  blockquote   pplanner returned error unable to find relevant index for maxmin   query amp with hintp blockquote  precodeplanner returned error hint provided does not work with min query codepre  pI used min max function because of the uncertainty of the range queries in MongoDB with lt, gt operators, which sometimes ignore either of the bound amp end up scanning more documents than needed.p  pI used indexes such asp  precodedb.user.ensureIndexcreatedAt 1  db.user.ensureIndextransaction.firstTransaction1  db.user.ensureIndextransaction.lastTransaction1  db.user.ensureIndextransaction.product1 codepre  pI tried to use compound indexing for the 3 query, which isp  pcodedb.user.ensureIndextransaction.firstTransaction1, transaction.product1codep  pBut this seems to give me no result. Query gets stuck amp never returns the result. I mean it. NEVER. Like deadlocked. I dont know why. So I dropped this index amp got the result after waiting for over half an hour really frustrating.p  pPlease help me out as I am really desperate to find out the solution amp out of ideas.p  pThis

Negative 59767 pI am working on a Python project that requires PIL to show images. However, the computers that I am working on often do not allow me to install things, and have a very bare bones python setup. For this reason, most of the modules that I need I simply place in the same directory as my python files.p  pI tried doing the same with PIL. I downloaded the pillow source, and copied the PIL folder into my project. I was then able to run import PIL with no problems. However, when I then tried to run from PIL import Image I get the error The Imaging C module is not installed. From other searches I think that installing Pillow properly would fix this problem, however I would like PIL to be more portable, and not require an instillation.p  pAny ideas would be great. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 59767 pI have a c program that computes populations within a given radius by reading gridded population data from an ascii file into a large 8640x3432element vector of doubles. Reading the ascii data into the vector takes 30 seconds looping over each column and each row, while the rest of the program only takes a few seconds. I was asked to speed up this process by writing the population data to a binary file, which would supposedly read in faster.p  pThe ascii data file has a few header rows that give some data specs like the number of columns and rows, followed by population data for each grid cell, which is formatted as 3432 rows of 8640 numbers, separated by spaces. The population data numbers are mixed formats and can be just 0, a decimal value 0.000685648, or a value in scientific notation 2.687768e05.p  pI found a few examples of readingwriting structs containing vectors to binary, and tried to implement something similar, but am running into problems. When I both write and read the vector tofrom the binary file in the same program, it seems to work and gives me all the correct values, but then it ends with either a segment fault 11 or a memory allocation error that a pointer being freed was not allocated. And if I try to just read the data in from the previously written binary file without rewriting it in the same program run, then it gives me the header variables just fine but gives me a segfault before giving me the vector data.p  pAny advice on what I might have done wrong, or on a better way to do this would be greatly appreciated I am compiling and running on a mac, and I dont have boost or other nonstandard libraries at present.

Negative 59767 pI want to embed a youtube video in my Android app. It has a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comdesignpatternsnavigationdrawer.html relnofollowNavigation Drawera, and when this drawer is opened, the video must to keep playing. And Id like my app could be capable of playing video with copyright restriction, for example, videos from a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comuserVEVO relnofollowVevoa. My first try was simply load the embed url codehttpswww.youtube.comembedVIDEOIDcode in a WebView with a Chrome Client, but for many videos, for example that from Vevo, like a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv6vImyP5EYc8 relnofollowthisa, I see this messagep  pcodeThis Video Contains content from Vevo. It is restricted from playback on certain sitescodep  pTo handle this error, I decided to use the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutube relnofollowYoutube APIa.p  pBetween the available implementations of this lib, Ive tried thesep  ul lia hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubeandroidplayer relnofollowAndroid APIali lia hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubeiframeapireference relnofollowIframe APIali lia hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubejsapireference relnofollowJavascript APIali ul  pThe Android API has the advantage that I can play video with the mentioned restriction, but it was discarded because its default behavior is the player stops the video when the Drawer is opened.p  pWith the Iframe API, I can play videos when the Drawer opens, but not that with the restriction.p  pMy last tentative is using the Javascript API. Currently, I have the same situation that iframe, that is, I cant play videos with restriction. p  pHowever I think this is the right way of finding a solution. In the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubejsapireference relnofollowapi referencea, they recommend using the a hrefhttpscode.google.compswfobject relnofollowSWFObjecta, but as far as i know, there is not flah available for mobile, like exposed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19362049setpluginsenablednotexistforwebview1936427319364273this answera. So, there is another way of embeding video in my WebViewp  pAnd another doubt is How do mobile sites can play video from youtube, even that with the certain sites restriction Please understand that who is asking here is an Android developer not much experienced with Javascript. p  pCurrently, I have this piece of codep  pstrongLayout where will be loaded the playerstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltFrameLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltWebView         androidididwebview         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt  ltFrameLayoutgt codepre  pstrongFragment that inflates this layoutstrongp  precodepublic View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState       View view  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragment, null      WebView webView  WebView view.findViewByIdR.id.webview      WebSettings webSettings  webView.getSettings     webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue      webView.loadUrlfileandroidassetplayerwebview.html     webView.setWebViewClientnew CustomClient      return view   private class CustomClient extends WebViewClient      Override     public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoadingWebView webview, String url          webview.setWebChromeClientnew WebChromeClient         webview.loadUrlurl         return true       codepre  pstrongHTML filestrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt    ltscript typetextjavascript src.swfobjectswfobject.jsgtltscriptgt    ltdiv idytapiplayergt       You need Flash player 8 and JavaScript enabled to view this video.   ltdivgt    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      var params   allowScriptAccess always      var atts   id myytplayer      swfobject.embedSWFhttpwww.youtube.comvG90AgiAMM6kenablejsapi1ampplayerapiidytplayerampversion3,                        ytapiplayer, 425, 356, 8, null, null, params, atts    ltscriptgt ltheadgt lthtmlgt     codepre

Negative 59767 pI just started getting into LLVM and clang compilers and the whole thing. I am following the book Getting started with llvm core libraries. I was under the impression that OS X comes bundled with llvm. However it seems that is not the case. I need to install llvm separately to get command line tools like llc or lli. p  pSo my question is, when I do a clang to compile my cc code, what backend does the work of creating the machine code  My installation shows commands like llvmgcc and llvmg . Does it mean that it uses gcc internally for creating machine code And do i need to brew install llvm to switch completely to llvm p

But DisallowOverscroll set to true makes sure that the screen doesnt bounce if scrolled entirely to the bottom or to the top. But my problem is once I put my finger on the screen and scroll down, the page starts shaking up and down. I tried everything for the past two days but nothing worked. Any help is really appreciated. p  pI also made a video to make it easier. a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvONd4ntZ46E relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvONd4ntZ46Eap  pstrongEDIT I figured that the problem is arising from pull hook feature pull to refresh. When I tested the page without the pull to refresh hook, it is working absolutely fine. But I am not sure how to use pull to refresh hook and not make the page judder at the same time.strongp

Negative 59767 pI read many blogs, and one of the themes that comes across often is that concerns at least the way Rails defines them are damaging to software. On balance I agree  simply including behaviour into models is violating the single responsibility principle. You end up with a godclass that does too much.p  pBut as with many of the opinions gleaned from blogs, an alternative architecture is rarely provided.p  pSo lets take an example app, loosely based on one I have to maintain. Its inherently a CMS, as many Rails apps tend to be.p  pCurrently each model has a large number of concerns. Lets use a few herep  precodeclass Article lt ActiveRecordBase   include ConcernsCommentable   include ConcernsFlaggable   include ConcernsPublishable   include ConcernsSluggable   ... end codepre  pYou can imagine that Commentable would require only a small amount of code added to the Article. Enough to establish relationships with comment objects and provide some utility methods to access them.p  pFlaggable, allowing users to flag inappropriate content, ends up adding some fields to the model codeflagged, flaggedby, flaggedatcode for example. And some code to add functionality.p  pSluggable adds a slug field for referencing in URLs. And some more code.p  pPublishable adds publish date and status fields, with yet more code.p  pNow what happens if we add a new kind of contentp  precodeclass Album lt ActiveRecordBase   include ConcernsFlaggable   include ConcernsSluggable   include ConcernsPublishable   ... end codepre  pAlbums are a bit different. You cant comment on them, but you can still publish them and flag them.p  pThen I add some more content types Events and Profiles, lets say.p  pI see a few problems with this architecture as it standsp  ul liWe have multiple database tables with exactly the same fields codeflaggedby, publishedoncode etc.li liWe cant retrieve multiple content types at once with a single SQL query. li liEach model supports the duplicated field names with the included concerns, giving each class multiple responsibilities.li ul  pSo whats a better wayp  pIve seen decorators promoted as a way to add functionality at the point where its needed. This could help solve the issue of included code, but the database structure isnt necessarily improved. It also looks needlessly fiddly and involves adding extra loops to the code to decorate arrays of models.p  pSo far my thinking goes like thisp  pCreate a common content model and tablep  precodeclass Content lt ActiveRecordBase end codepre  pThe associated table is probably quite small. It should probably have some kind of type field, and maybe some things common to absolutely all content  like a type slug for URLs perhaps.p  pThen rather than adding concerns we can create an associated model for each behaviourp  precodeclass Slug lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto content   ... end  class Flag lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto content   ... end  class Publishing lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto content   ... end  class Album lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto content   ... end ... codepre  pEach of these is associated with one piece of content, so the foreign key can exist on the features model. All the behaviour relating to the feature can also exist solely on the features model, making OO purists happier.p  pIn order to achieve the kind of behaviour that usually requires model hooks codebeforecreatecode for example I can see an observer pattern being more useful. A slug is created once a contentcreated event is sent, etc.p  pThis looks like it would clean things up no end. I can now search all content with a single query, I dont have duplicated field names in the database and I dont need to include code into the content model.p  pBefore I merrily unleash it on my next project, has anyone tried this approach Would it work Or would splitting things up this much end up creating a hell of SQL queries, joins and tangled code Can you suggest a better alternativep

Im using the Sandbox to test the payment process...dont know if that makes a difference to this problem.p  pIm assuming that the settings to change this link text are in PayPal and not in WooCommerce couldnt find anything at all like that in my WooCommerce settings. If it is a WooCommerce issue, I will post on the appropriate forum. Thought Id try PayPal first. Thanks.p

The program consistently fails with a MemoryError when it first tries to read the file into memory.

Negative 59767 pIm trying to clean up an older Symfony2 project where most of the code is inside controllers. Long, repetitive blocks of code in a controller is not optimal, it makes debugging amp development very tedious and errorprone.p  pThere are plenty of things I can easily clean up and move into services, as those blocks of code provide some sort of reusable functionality. I get that any welldefined task should live in a service, and controllers should just be wiring.p  pBut no matter where I move the code, there are always small repetitive blocks cluttering everything up. Things like initializationtransformationparsingfiltering patterns for example, which are used extensively in our application.p  pTake for example the data kneading needed for the creation of a DataTablep  precodeclass DefaultController extends Controller       public function indexAction           data  array some data           encoders  arraynew JsonEncoder         normalizers  arraynew GetSetMethodNormalizer         serializer  new Serializernormalizers, encoders         datatable  thisgtgetdatatables.orders         datatablegtbuildDatatableView         datatablegtsetDataserializergtserializedata, json          return arraydatatablegtdatatable       codepre  pThats a very common, but also very verbose pattern. Our developers tend to store dozens of these kinds of little patterns in text files on their own computers, and often copypaste them into controllers.p  pIf I try to think of solutions to make the code a bit more concise and DRY, there are multiple options.p  ul liI could filter duplicate patterns out of all actions and dump them into private functions. Ive done this in some locations to clear things up a bit, but its a bad solution that is localized to each controller.li liI could create one or more generalized helper classes with all these code snippets, and codeusecode them whenever I need them in a service or controller, containing all kinds of parsingcheckingfilteringbuilding functions. It would probably turn into a garbage collection of tiny unrelated methods though.li liI could create one or more abstract classes with propertiesmethods used in many servicescontrollers, and inherit from that. Feels hacky, especially if I need to sandwich it in between a user defined controller and the Symfony framework controller class.li liI could define traits for these datatransformation functions, and use those wherever applicable. People often claim that PHP traits are almost always bad.

Negative 59767 pI am trying to send a char array through the selector method in NSTimer. My targetMethod will take the first 36 values of the array and perform its function every interval, incrementing by 36 every time until it reaches the end of the char array. However, it appears as though NSTimer only allows you send NSObjects with userInfo when using the following formatp  precode[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval2.0     targetself     selectorselectortargetMethod     userInfonil     repeatsNO] codepre  pI havent found a way to use NSDictionary to do it either, and I would prefer to not have to perform a costly conversion to an NSArray. p  pThe char array that I am sending contains anywhere from 369500 values. Is it possible to use a char array with NSTimer If not, is there a way I could use a global pointer to refer to an array which could then be accessed by the pointer within the targetMethodp

Negative 59767 pWhen the Gang of four introduced the singleton pattern, they also had to explain, why not to use static class fields and method instead. The reason was the possibility to inherit. For Java it had sense  we cannot normally inherit the class fields and methods.p  pLater the Effective Java book appeared. And we know now that the existence of reflection destroys the singularity of the singleton class with private constructor. And the only way to make a real SINGLEton is to make it as a single item of an enumeration. Nice. I had done some myself this way.p  pBut a question remains While we cannot inherit from enumeration, what is the use of this singleton Why we dont use these old good staticclass fields and methods p  pEdit. Thanks to the bayou.io I see that in a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.coma20418144104httpprogrammers.stackexchange.coma20418144104a there is a code that can trick the enum, too, and create again two exemplars of the enum singleton. The other problems are mentioned there, too. So, there is no need to use enum instead of the usual singleton class pattern, too BTW, all enum pluses that are mentioned here till now, work for singleton classes, too. p
