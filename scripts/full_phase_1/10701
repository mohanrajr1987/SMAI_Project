Positive 10701 pIm working on an app that makes a POST to a REST API that returns a URI in its response. I then am to make a GET request to that URI and it is supposed to return HTML content in the response body. However, the GET request returns No Content in its HTTP Status Code.p  pWhats strange is, I have a small console app I built for testing purposes that if I plug the URI into it allows me to test the GET without making the POST, the status good is 200  OK and I receive the HTML content in the body.

Positive 10701 pIn C, each of these tasks are relatively easy. I need to open a webpage and login while using an authenticated proxy.p  pThe first approach was to use HTTPWebRequest and HTTPWebResponse to GET and POST to login to the webpage. This worked well, especially with how simply the WebRequest object handles the Proxy object.p  pThe problem with this approach is, there is JavaScript code that appends hidden inputs to the login form. Precompile time I cant know all of the parameters for the POST request.p  pThe next approach was to use the WebBrowser object which worked extremely well for logging in. I just did a GetElementById and set the InnerText for username and password and it happily sent the POST request.p  pThe problem with this approach is that the WebBrowser doesnt make use of the Proxy object. One solution I saw for using a WebBrowser object was to change the Internet SettingsIE programmatically and then login. However, while running multi threaded, each thread will all be on the same proxy undesirable.p  pAre there any elegant solutions for my problem It seems the best i will be able to do is to manually parse the JS and build the POST request myself and send it using HTTPWebRequest. This approach sounds horrible and error prone.p

When Linq then generates the query, it doesnt even attempt to see if the field has been updated, since it has a new id, it simply write the value to the database.  But, Im simply speculating and hope that someone else can provide a better understanding of what is going on behind the scenes.p  pstrongEDITstrong To address Jons post, the reason for the issue as it is explained on the MS Connect site is that the XML field does not update because LinqtoSQL doesnt handle the XElement.Changed event.p  pFor my implementation, the code that works ends up looking something like thisp  precodeMyXElementProperty.SetElementValueAuthor, author  MyXElementProperty  new XElementMyXElementProperty codepre  pFor reference to anyone else that finds this question, the following also worksp  precodeMyXElementProperty  new XElementMyXElementProperty  MyXElementProperty.SetElementValueAuthor, author codepre

Negative 10701 pI have a simple application that counts down to midnight and then plays a beeping sound over and over again and blinks the label showing the time. So the label blinking uses an NSTimer, while the beeping goes on its own Thread, so that the pure C function for the system sound id completion callback can use [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval...] to wait a bit in between playing the alarm beep sound. So I get two error messages during execution saying theres no autorelease pool and it will just leak. Its because in the method that I call into a new thread, Theres two Strings that are used to create the System Sound ID the file name and extension. Is there a way I can not use an autorelease pool since those are the only two things that ever try to use it. Thanks.p  pOr should I use two NSTimers instead of another thread..p  pBen Gottliebs answer was right, however I decided to use another NSTimer instead because I forgot about how its not really synced to the time when you sleep the thread as the actual execution of the code before it takes a bit of time. And it makes things symmetrical .p

Negative 10701 pI have an application that performs various tasks that can take up to a minute each. I wanted to make sure that I was setting the application to a working status in a consistent way, so I set up a class well call it LockI that when initialized records the current state of various things the cursor, the status bar, screen updating and so on. Then when its restrict method is called, it sets everything to a working status. In the class destructor all of the original settings are restored, so I dont have to worry about an error or someone forgetting to call the restore method leaving the application all locked up. Also because it restore the application to the state it was found in, if a second call to the class is made, I dont have to worry about it accidentally unlocking the application when the class deeper in the stack is destroyed.p  pSo now to my question, assuming that what I have described above isnt already a mistake, should the application be locked inside the various procedures, or lock the application in the event handlers like a button click handler and then call the procedure Or some other option.p  pstrongClarificationstrong To be more concise... Taking into account the followingp  ol liFor longer actions, you will need an instance of the Lock class available in order to update the progress bar. li liYou might be calling more than one procedure unless you funnel them through a toplevel procedure.li liYou wont be displaying a status bar for emallem procedures as sometimes its just not needed and actually slows things down.li ol  pIs it better to instantiate the class in the click handler and then pass it to the called procedures as needed or  to instantiate the class in the called procedure and if you need to call multiple procedures set up a funnelp

Negative 10701 pIn Actionscript 3, most events use the capturetargetbubble model, which is pretty popular nowadaysp  blockquote   pWhen an event occurs, it moves through the three phases of the event flow the capture phase, which flows from the top of the display list hierarchy to the node just before the target node the target phase, which comprises the target node and the bubbling phase, which flows from the node subsequent to the target node back up the display list hierarchy.p blockquote  pHowever, some events, such as the Sprite classs codeenterFramecode event, do not capture OR bubble  you must subscribe directly to the target to detect the event.

Efficiency is very important to me in this project.p  pBased on my knowledge of the data Ive build a class hierarchy of what I think an object should look like...p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text  namespace ExtractProcessing      class Extract              private string mFilePath         private string mFileName         private FileHeader mFileHeader         private FileTrailer mFileTrailer         private ListltBatchgt mBatches        A file can have many batches          public Extractstring filePath           Using file path some static method from another class would be called to parse in the file somehow            public string ToString           Iterates all objects down the heiarchy to return the file in string format            public void ToFile           Calls some method in the file parse static class to export the file back to storage somewhere             class FileHeader       ... contains data types for all fields in this format, ToString etc        class Batch              private string mBatchNumber                 Should this be pulled out of the batch header to make LINQ querying simpler for this data set         private BatchHeader mBatchHeader         private BatchTrailer mBatchTrailer         private ListltTransactiongt mTransactions     A batch can have multiple transactions          public string ToString           Iterates through batches to return what the entire batch would look like in string format             class BatchHeader       ... contains data types for all fields in this format, ToString etc        class Transaction       ... contains data types for all fields in this format, ToString etc        class BatchTrailer       ... contains data types for all fields in this format, ToString etc        class FileTrailer       ... contains data types for all fields in this format, ToString etc     codepre  pIve left out many constructors and other methods but I think the idea should be pretty solid.  Im looking for ideas and critique to the methods Im considering as again, not knowledgable about C and the execution time is the highest priority.p  pBiggest question besides some critique is, how should I bring in this file  Ive brought in many files in other languages such as VBA using FSO methods, Microsoft Access ImportSpec to read in the file 5 times, one for each spec... wow that was inefficient, created a Cursor object in visual foxpro which was FAAAAAAAST but again, had to do five times but am looking for hidden gems in C if said things exist.  p  pThanks for reading my novel, let me know if your having issues understanding it.  Im taking the weekend to go over this design to see if I buy it and want to take the effort to implement it this way.p

Negative 10701 pI have a rather convoluted scenario where I want to create a DynamicMethod thats attached to a class in an inmemory AssemblyBuilder.

In this way, one can create a clean separation between the graphics and UI initializations.brbrThe purpose of the context initially isnt for rendering although I believe one could render into textures using it. If one wanted to change the contents of a buffer within a particular context, the desired context object itself would just need to be made current since its carrying the dummy window around with it, this is possible. Rendering into a window is simple As implied by the above, the windows DC only needs to have the same pixel format. Simply make the rendering context and the windows DC current, and render.brbrPlease note that, at the time of this writing, this idea is still in testing.

Negative 10701 pI have a lookup table that contains products Product table a CustomerOrder table that contains order details and an OrderLines table that contains a line per product ordered.p  pSo the entities look something like thisp  h2OrderLineh2  precodeId ..stuff.. Product codepre  h2Producth2  precodeId ProductInfo codepre  pThe tables look the same except instead of Product there is a ProductId foreign key. The mapping overrides look like thisp  pFor OrderLinep  precodemapping.HasOnex gt x.Product         .Fetch.Join         .Cascade.All codepre  pThat is it really. The problem is this, with the above statement a null gets inserted as the ProductId foreign key, if I remove the mapping it works correctly, but this causes multiple as in thousands of selects further on in the system. What am I missing here  If I put a virtual back to OrderLine in Product, then NHibernate tries to update both entities i.e. it tries to insert a new record in the product table, which already exists. How do I tell NHibernate about this relationship, without it trying to update Products p  pHelp would be most appreciated.p

Negative 10701 pstrongContextstrong Web app on MobileSafariiPad, both fullscreen and embedded in iframep  pstrongGoalstrong Technique that provides custom event handlers for emPressem and emTapem but strongnotstrong  emPinchem zoom or emDragem scrollpan.  We want to provide custom behavior for Press, but to let Safari handle ScrollPanZoom still.p  pstrongProblemstrong The two goals seem to be mutually exclusive.  To prevent the default behavior for a Press gesture, a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMevent.preventDefaultevent.preventDefaulta must be called in immediate response to a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarysafaridocumentationappleapplicationsreferencesafariwebcontentHandlingEventsHandlingEvents.htmlontouchstarta. However, to let the default behavior proceed on a Drag, we must strongnotstrong call event.preventDefault on the initial ontouchstart.  Once preventDefault is called, there is no way of getting the default behavior back during that gesture sequence i.e. until all fingers come off.  Drag is not recognized until some movement has occurred.p  pDrag is illustrated as the simplest example, but we care about getting the default behavior for Pinch and Doubletap as well.  We never want the default MobileSafari Press behavior of Copy Image or selecting text.p  pAttempts thus farp  ul liSave the ontouchstart event and, after a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMwindow.setTimeouttimeouta, call preventDefault on it later just before Press would be recognized.  No effect.li liListen for a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMwindow.oncontextmenuoncontextmenua.  Nope, the default Press behavior is not being signaled or routed through this event.li liPrevent the default in all of our ontouch handlers, and then when we recognize a DragPinch gesture, simulate new events using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarysafaridocumentationUserExperienceReferenceTouchEventClassReferenceTouchEventTouchEvent.htmlinitTouchEventa andor a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarysafaridocumentationUserExperienceReferenceGestureEventClassReferenceGestureEventGestureEvent.htmlinitGestureEventa.  The programmatically created events hit all of emourem callbacks, but Safari seems to pay no attention to them, triggering no default behavior.li liBreak up Safaris Press recognition with a fake move.  Safari cancels a press on the slightest move, but we allow for a bit of slop.  Simulating a move event as above just after the ontouchstart does not cause Safari to fail to recognize Press if the finger is not moved for real.li ul  pWe have a fully featured set of gesture recognizers implemented in Javascript, ontouch in the style of Apples a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationEventHandlingConceptualEventHandlingiPhoneOSGestureRecognizersGestureRecognizers.htmlnative iOS gesture recognizersa.  We have no problem recognizing any gestures, we just dont know of a good way to replicate the ZoomPanDoubletap behavior that Safari provides for free.p  pWe dont need code were looking for any theoretical solution beyond just implement panzoom yourself too, though if you have a slick way of doing that were interested that leads to reasonable success.  Were also interested in learning about other similar attempts to do this  emsurely we cant have been the first to try thisemp  pstrongAlternate TLDRstrong Is there any way to prevent a default Press also known as tapandhold other than in touchstartp

Negative 10701 pI realise that there are other topics like this, but none of them really help. Im trying to get variables from one view into another, but I have absolutely no idea how.p  pTo give some backstory, my game is a fruit ninja like game where stuff goes on the screen and you have to slice it. If 3 sprites leave the screen unsliced, the game is over and it flips to the game over view screen with a button to go back. Additionally, this SHOULD go to the flipSideView, which is the highscore, but my implementation of the flipSideView transition doesnt work. This isnt the main issue, the main issue is that I dont know how to get the score from the game in the mainView which stores it as an int into the flipSideView which has the player name.p  pThe main view changes to the gameOverView through this condition in the tick method which performs regular checks and methods for the gamep  precodeif lifeCounter lt 1           gameIsOver  YES         [self showInfo0]         [self viewGameOverScreen]  codepre  pThat goes to the gameOverView, which will sit there until the replay button is pressed withp  precode IBActionreplayActionidsender           [self.delegate gameOverViewControllerDidFinish self]  codepre  pgameOverViewControllerDidFinish restarts the game and dismisses the view.p  precode void gameOverViewControllerDidFinish GameOverViewController  controller          [self restart]         [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated YES]  codepre  pThe restart method just resets the 3 primary values in the main view The score, the level, the lives.p  pAs it restarts, the game should take the score and whatever name is stored in the text field in the flipSideView which can be viewed at any one time gameplay and store it somehow for future reference. Its not supposed to store it in a file yet because thats next weeks task.p  pI dont wanna post the entire program due to plagiarism issues, but if there are additional parts that might make it easier to understand, I will definitely post them.p  pThanks in advance, Christianp

Negative 10701 pI am currently working in a very large solution 120 projects.

Thats not very cool.p  pInstead, Id like to make a little tool that can identify the source file for a form, or at least the name property of the form object. p  pWe cant add code to the solution itself, so we will have to make an external exe.p  pI am not sure if this is even possible.

Negative 10701 pThis is a question of what the best practice is for declaring new variables, and Ive seen this situation a few times now.  I have a class whose constructor reads a config file, egp  precodeConfigMgr config  new ConfigMgrargs[0] codepre  pOf course, if you run the console app without that argument, an exception results.  If I surround that line with a trycatch as follows, I get the error The name config does not exist in the current context.  Understandable.p  precodetry      ConfigMgr config  new ConfigMgrargs[0]  catch      Console.WriteLineConfig file not specified or incorrect in format.  Exiting.

Negative 10701 pIm trying to learn how list item choices can be passed within the same activity in an Android application. Below, Ive got a simple page layout that creates a ListView which is populated by a static string array. I have three other static string arrays listed below that. When the page first loads, it loads up the first array into the ListView. Alot of the code on this page Ive cobbled together by reading articles on Android here on stackoverflow, so if Im doing something dumb, I want to hear about it. My goal is ultimately to have these static string arrays actually populated from an inflated xml file that is synced to the app, but first things first. Im trying to build my basics first.p  pSo I have a listener set on the item click for the ListView. What I need help with is, how do I capture what item they clicked on, and then recreate the activity with the new string array loaded into it I saw one example which I emulated and it made the app look like it was actually changing pages everytime. Considering the screen will have some static elements on it a menu bar, Id like it to refresh itself independent of the overall layout I guess the best way to describe it in web terminology would be asynchronously, like with AJAX or jQuery.p  pThe order of events is TEST1 is the root with one choice. Click on the choice and it loads up TEST2. If item 1 on TEST2 is chosen, load TEST3a, and vice versa with 2, TEST3b.p  pHopefully this makes sense... let me know if I can elaborate further.p  ppublic class MyLayout extends ListActivity p  precodeOverride public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState    super.onCreatesavedInstanceState    setListAdapternew ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, R.layout.listlayout, TEST1    ListView lv  getListView   lv.setTextFilterEnabledtrue    lv.setOnItemClickListenernew OnItemClickListener      public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View view,         int position, long id           What do I do here           static final String[] TEST1  new String[]          Members         static final String[] TEST2  new String[]      Joe A.

Negative 10701 pI have a simple twoscreen app that I built a year ago using the utility project template in Xcode 3. This creates an app delegate, a main view and a flipside view. The flipside view has a UINavigationBar at the top with a Done button in the left position.p  pI just finally upgraded to Xcode 4 with SDK 4.3, and when I build the app now, the Done button doesnt appear, either in the simulator or on my device. But if I create a new project using the Xcode 4 utility template, the Done button displays and works correctly. Unfortunately the upgrade removed my SDK 4.2 files, so I cant rebuild for SDK 4.2 and test whether thats what made the difference.p  pI noticed that the new template sets up the main view differently, using the rootViewController property of the window rather than adding the main view as a subview of the window a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5248460selfwindowrootviewcontrollervswindowaddsubviewmore info herea. I tried copying this code into my app delegate instead of the addSubview code, but the view didnt display at all, so I must have missed something ... but I would just as soon maintain iOS 3.0 compatibility anyway. I cant find any other difference between the newer utility template and my own project based on the old template.p  pI also tried moving the Done button from the leftButtonItem to the rightButtonItem in Interface Builder, but it still doesnt appear.p  pMORE INFOp  pI tried this on all the versions of the iPhone simulator that are available in my Xcode installation. When building with SDK 4.3, the Done button does not appear with the iOS 4.04.3 simulators ... but it does appear with the iOS 5 beta simulator.p  pNext, I wired up IBOutlets to the navigation bar, navigation item and done button in Interface Builder so I could probe them from my code. When I checked them immediately after presenting the flipside view with presentModalViewController, I found that the done button a UIBarButtonItem exists, but the navigation items leftBarButtonItem is null. If I assign the done button to that property, it appears. So somehow that button is getting disconnected from the leftBarButtonItem property when the flipside view is initialized or displayed.p  pWORKAROUNDp  pIn Interface Builder, if I view the outlets for the Navigation Item, I see that the Done button is linked to its leftBarButtonItem property, but if I view the outlets for the Done button, it has no links. If I link it to the Navigation Item then the button appears With this setup, the Done button shows the Navigation Item as an outlet, and the Navigation Item shows the Done button as an outlet twice. This is not needed in the new Utility Application template, so I dont know why its needed here. It seems to be working, but if anyone has an explanation or a better solution Ill reserve my answer points for that. p

Negative 10701 pMy current application is based on akka 1.1. It has multiple codeProjectAnalysisActorscode each  responsible for handling analysis tasks for a specific project. The analysis is started when such an actor receives a generic start message. After finishing one step it sends itself a message with the next step as long one is defined. The executing code basically looks as followsp  precode sealed trait AnalysisEvent     def runproject Project Future[Any]    def nextStep AnalysisEvent  null   case class StartAnalysis extends AnalysisEvent     override def run ...    override def nextStep AnalysisEvent  new FirstStep   case class FirstStep extends AnalysisEvent     override def run ...    override def nextStep AnalysisEvent  new SecondStep   case class SecondStep extends AnalysisEvent     ...   class ProjectAnalysisActorproject Project extends Actor       def receive           case event AnalysisEvent              val future  event.runproject             future.onComplete  f                  self  event.nextStep                      codepre  pI have some difficulties how to implement my code for the runmethods for each analysis step. At the moment I create a new future within each runmethod. Inside this future I send all followup messages into the different subsystems. Some of them are nonblocking fireandforget messages, but some of them return a result which should be stored before the next analysis step is started.p  pAt the moment a typical runmethod looks as followsp  precode def runproject Project Future[Any]       Future          progressActor  typicalFireAndForgetproject.name         val calcResult  calcActor1  doCalcMessageproject.getOrElse...          val p Project  ...  created updated project using calcResult          val result  storage  updateProjectInformationp.getOrElse...         result       codepre  pSince those blocking messages should be avoided, Im wondering if this is the right way. Does it make sense to use them in this use case or should I still avoid it If so, what would be a proper solutionp

Negative 10701 pWe are using our first website that will give the users the choice of either using our standard .net membership provider or facebook using the facebook c sdk awesome sdk by the way.p  pWe have handled most of it but need to restrict access to certain areas based on the user being logged in or not.  In the past with pure .net membership we used the [Authorize] attribute on the method, however if the user is logged in using facebook then this is false.p  pI know I can try to roll our own dataannotation extension.

Negative 10701 pIm adding a compass overlay to my mapping application. Ive decided to create a fairly complicated compass rose and have that drawn to a bitmap in the overlays constructor just once, rather than on every draw. In the overlays draw I just rotate the bitmap according to the magnetic sensors value with a Matrix.p  pIn short, it is incorrect when the rotation is anything other than 90, 180 or 270 degrees  it appears not to rotate about the centre.p  pIve created a minimal sample which reproduces the problem which is shown below together with screen shots of the 0, 45 and 90 degree rotations that I see.

Negative 10701 pI hope I can explain this clearly..p  pIs there a way to configure the delphi XE IDE to stop it creating new events in alphabetical orderp  pIn Delphi 7 new event declarations were added to the end of the unit, and here are my problems with XE.p  p1 When I create my Menus or Actions, lets say a standard File Menu New, Open, Save etc..  I normally double click these and let Delphi create the event declarations for it. This worked perfect in Delphi 7 as the declarations were easily found and grouped together at the end of the unit.p  pDelphi XE seems to instead move the declarations in alphabetical order, making it harder to find the declarations, they are no longer grouped together and its making life harder and more time consuming because of it.p  p2 The same rule applies with new class declarations, suppose I have a simple class such asp  precodeTMyClass  class   private     constructor Create     destructor Destroy      procedure Initialize   public     procedure Test     procedure Blah   end codepre  pI use the keyboard shortcut CtrlShiftC which lets Delphi create the declarations for me, like sop  precode TMyClass   procedure TMyClass.Blah begin  end  constructor TMyClass.Create begin  end  destructor TMyClass.Destroy begin  end  procedure TMyClass.Initialize begin  end  procedure TMyClass.Test begin  end codepre  pLike my first example, the declarations have been put in alphabetical order. To some people this may seem like no problem at all, but to me this is an annoyance I would rather not have to put up with.p  pDelphi 7 would put them in order by the way they were defined or created from the form designer, not alphabetical.p  pIs there an option maybe I cannot find to change this behaviorp  pI hope I explained clearly p  pThanks.p

If the reference count for the child view controller is constantly 1 even after I repeat the process of presenting it and hiding it a few times, does this mean I am out of the woodsp  pIn other words, is this the only thing I should take care of in order to allow monotouchios to do proper garbage collection and not hog the devices memory I am asking because the TOTAL MEMORY as reported in the profiler is increased with each presentation, even though the reference count of the child view controller does not increase. p  pThe child view controller uses a lot of UIImage, loaded with UIImage.FromBundlep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 10701 pI use a google maps v3 with marker clusterer v3 to display 1000s of markers.  I also have a sidepanel that lists the titles of each marker.  When a user hovers over a title in the panel I animate the corresponding marker, and I stop animating on mouseout.p  pThis works fine when the marker isnt in a cluster.  I have a problem when the marker is in a cluster.p  pIf the marker is in a cluster I first change the markers map object from null previously set by markerClusterer so to hide the marker once it puts it in a cluster to my map object, and then I animate the marker.  Again, this works.  Its on mouseout that I experience my problem.p  pOn mouseout I set the marker animation to null and then set the markers map object to null.  This does what you would expect hides the marker, but I cant get the marker to show again on any subsequent hover event.  The marker still exists inside the appropriate cluster object, and I can call setMap to set the markers map property, but the marker still wont show up on the map.  Here is the relevant codep  precode        if event.type  mouseover  event.type  mouseenter                      if marker.getMap  marker is in a cluster                 inCluster  true                 marker.setMapmap              else                  inCluster  false                          marker.setAnimationgoogle.maps.Animation.BOUNCE          else              marker.setAnimationnull             if inCluster  true  hide the clusterized marker                 marker.setMapnull                       codepre  pIf I commentout the two setAnimation calls, then the code will work and the marker can be displayed and then hidden as expected just not animated.  Also, when I play around with the console, I can display the marker out of the cluster, then I can animate it, then i can deanimate it, then I can hide it again, overandover.  But, if I call setMapnull before deanimating the marker, then I hit my bug. p  pSo, the problem only exists when animation hasnt stopped prior to calling setMapnull.  Ive tried setting a timer to give the animation a few hundred milliseconds to stop before calling setMap, and this sometimes works, but other times it triggers other, even worse behavior.p  pAny help solving this would be greatly appreciated and eagerly acceptedp
Negative 10701 pIs it true that for Angry Birds or Cut the Rope, they draw the whole frame of the whole screen first the whole view, and then paint the whole frame onto the screen, making the animation smooth  p  pThats because if we animate a metal ball, of size 20 x 20 pixel, and if we erase the ball first, and then draw the ball at a new location, then there might be some flickering very subtle but noticeable.p  pThe same might be if it is animated by codedrawRectcode, which will erase the whole screen, and then draw everything in their new locations, which might have even more flicker than abovep  pGoing back to the drawing whole frame method if a ball was at coordinate 100,100, and now the ball is painted on top of the whole screenshot with the new background exposed, at coordinate 103, 100, then it is very unnoticeable for the changes. no disappearing and then reappearing happening at all.p  pHow can smooth animation be achieved that looks like Angry Birds or Cut the Rope gamep

Negative 10701 pIve been searching near and far for a solution to my question but I am having difficulty even defining my search terms. p  pI have a method that creates a Swing GUI using invokeLater where the user completes some task.

Im looking for a more elegant solution  it is my best guess that I would need to make use of threads but am unsure how to go about this.p  pAny help would be much appreciated p  pstrongUpdatestrong Some clarification What is happening is that an external class is calling the dfTestCase.run function and expects a String to be returned. Essentially, the flow is linear with the external class calling dfTestCase.runthe GUI being invokedthe user makes a decision and clicks a buttoncontrol to the initial calling thread is returned and run is completed. p  pFor now my dirty solution is to just put a while loop with a flag to continuously poll the status of the GUI.

Negative 10701 pRecall that the K combinator is a constant function.

The birds have behavior p  pGiven any birds A and B, if you call out the name of B to A, then A will respond by calling out the name of some bird to you this bird we will designate by AB. p  pSuppose the forest consists of three birds, A, B, and C. Is it possible for at least one of the birds to behave like the K combinatorp  pBelow is a table that shows one possible set of behaviors for the birds in the enchanted forest. The first column has the name of each bird in the forest. The top row has the names that may be called out to each bird. The body is the response of a bird to a name. For example, if you call out the name of A to bird A, then bird A will respond with C see row 2, column 2. Succinctly, AA  C. If you call out the name of B to bird A, then bird A will respond with B see row 2, column 3. Succinctly, AB  B.

Negative 10701 pI have the same problem using either the SocketRocket or Unitt web socket libraries on iOS to perform secure web sockets. I have control over the Java web socket server  Netty  and can observe the serverside SSLTLS data in detail. I use port 6970 for the socket.p  pAfter the client wss socket is properly opened with a TLS handshake, I get a server error on the first client data write, i.e. the web socket handshake. The client writes 202 bytes, the server receives 272 bytes and the message authentication code fails on the server. I see my client data in the server trace, but it has 8 bytes of garbage prepended.p  pFirst I tried the SocketRocket library with the same results on the server  bad MAC after a good handshake. My android version of the Unitt client works great. My JavaScript secure web socket code also works great.p  pOn iOS  XCode I can debug as far as CFWriteStreamWrite... in UnittAsyncSocketdoSendBytes  which reports that 202 client data bytes indeed get written. But I am at a loss as to how to debug further. Somewhere, the iOS TLS framework is corrupting my client data during the send  I think. p

Negative 10701 pIm rather new to ObjectiveC and iOS development, and after having read some of the documentation on the Accelerometer class Im still not sure about a few things so maybe you can clarify these for me..

Then the rest of the code should be executed as shown above and at some point I will return to that whileloop and check the Yvalue again. In other words, rather than setting an interval regarding how often to check the accelerometer value, I want to let that interval be the time it takes to execute the rest of the code and come back to the while loop that will be checking the Yvalue again.. Or is this interval between the two checks so short that could cause problems eventuallyp  pThanks p

Negative 10701 pIn a certain situation, Id like my app to be able to fake an incoming SMS on the users device, as a sort of notification.  This would save me money when Id normally use Twilio to send a text to my users but I know they already have my app.  Is there any way to do this  I imagine it would have something to do with Intents and Content Providers but I dont really know where to start.p  pTo clarify Im not new to Android and I do respect all of the normal Notification methods.  However, my app will have an optin for text messages and Id like to be able to trigger them for free rather than paying for it.  This is for SMSspecific uses and not as a substitute for a normal Notification.p

Negative 10701 pIm brand new to Unit Testing, fresh out of college, and suddenly responsible for developing and maintaining a fairly large application by myself.

Negative 10701 pSo we are working in with 2 different repositories and both designers modified the same file. p  pthe problem is quite simple but I have no ideas how to solve it yet. Both files are marked as new since they have almost nothing in common except that file.p  pWhen I try to merge from branch A to B it mark the parts added in A deleted in B and on the other side, what was added in B appears deleted in A. p  pgit seems to try to outsmart me when I know that I need almost every changes and nothing should be mark as deletion. p  pI have 2 other branch that should merge without problem after these 2 branch. I cant merge them yet since there are some recent changes that may not merge really well too.p  pI have to merge A and B  E then C and D  F and then hopefully E and Fp  pSo the big question here is how can I do a completely manual merge that will mark every changes as conflict anything deleted anything added should be marked as conflict that I can solve by myself using an editor.p  pGit is trying to outsmart me and fail terribly at it. p

Negative 10701 pWe are in the process of migrating to a new server. We are using the same version of php on both the new and old servers with very similar settings. Our application uses the php ftp functions to connect to a remote ftp and upload files to it from our server. p  pThe problem I am finding is that the new server is so much slower than the old one at uploading the files. I have done numerous tests with multiple large and small files and I have narrowed it down to the ftpconnect and ftplogin php functions the process of transferring the file is very quick on both servers. On the old server this log in process takes a fraction of a second 0.2seconds, however on the new server it takes about 5 seconds. p  pCan anyone suggest to me if there is a php setting or a server setting that might be causing the ftp login to take so much longer p  pThanksp

Negative 10701 pI have the following problem in my version there are some constraints which probably make the problem easier to solve, but a general solution would also be nicep  pI have 4 lists, with 10 entries. The first list contains integer entries between 0 and 6, the other three contain entries between 0 and 3.  I now have to find the 100 best combinations of elements of these four lists.  One combination consists of the sum of 4 values, one from each list.  Note that I dont only need to know the values of the resulting elements, but also how they were composed, as there is more information associated with the values. p  pstrongExample 1strongp  precodelist A 6, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 list B 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 list C 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 list D 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 codepre  pThe five best combinations would in this case bep  ul li14 A[0]  B[0]  C[0]  D[0]li li14 A[0]  B[0]  C[1]  D[0]li li13 A[0]  B[1]  C[0]  D[0]li li13 A[0]  B[1]  C[1]  D[0]li li12 A[0]  B[0]  C[0]  D[1]li ul  pNote that I have sorted the entries of the lists, as this would probably the first step of most algorithms which solve this problem. p  h2Trivial solutionh2  pThe easiest solution consists of forming all 10.000 possible combinations and then choose the hundred bests out of these.  One does not even have to sort the 10.000 possible combinations.  One can first scan through the array and analyze which value appears how often.  Then one can pick the hundred best values and their further attributes in the next scan through the values. p  h2A solution which does not workh2  pAnother idea which came to my mind is the following  First one has to sort the lists.  In each list I want to find an index, which separates those entries which can contribute to a solution from them which cant.  When one had to find the four best combinations in example 1, one could for example select the first two elements of lists codeBcode and codeCcode, and the first one of lists codeAcode and codeDcode This would yieldp  precodeA 6 B 3, 2 C 3, 2 D 3 codepre  pAll combinations of these sublists would yield the optimal solution.  However this is not always possible, as can be seen in the following examplep  pstrongExample 2strongp  pthis time with only two listsp  precodelist A 6, 5, 5, 0, 0, ... list B 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, ... codepre  pHere, the best four solutions are p  ul li6  3li li5  3li li5  3li li6  1li ul  pHowever this solution can not be found with indexes, which separate four combinations from all other combinations. p

Negative 10701 pI am planning to integrate real time notifications into a web application that I am currently working on. I have decided to go with XMPP for this and selected openfire server which i thought to be suitable for my needs.p  pThe front end uses strophe library to fetch the notifications using BOSH from my openfire server. However the notices are the notifications and other messages are to be posted by my application and hence I think this code needs to reside at the backend. Initially I thougt of going with PHP XMPP libraries like XMPHP and JAXL but then I think that this would cause much overhead as each script will have to do same steps like connection, authentication etc. and I think this would make the PHP end a little slow and unresponsive.p  pNow I am thinking of creating a middleware application acting as a web service that the PHP will call and this application will handle the stuff with XMPP service. The benefit with this is that this appa server if you will will have to connect just once and the it will sit there listening on a port. also I am planning to build it in a asynchronous way such that It will first take all the requests from my PHp app and then when there are no more requests go about doing the notification publishing stuff. I am planninng to create this service in Python using SleekXMPP.p  pThis is just what I planned. I am new to XMPP and this whole web service stuff ans would like to take your comments on this regarding issues like memory and CPU usage, advantages, disadvantages, scalability issues,security etc.p  pThanks in advance.p  pPS also if something like this already existsalthough I didnt find after a lot of Googling Please direct me there.p  pEDIT  The middlelevel service should be doing the followingbut not limited to 1. Publishing notifications for different level of groups and community pages. 2. Notification for single user on some event. 3. User registrationcan be done using user service plugin though.p  pEDIT  Also it should like to create pubsub nodes and subscribe and unsubscribe users from these pubsub nodes.p  pAlso I want to store the notifications and messages in a databaseopenfire doesnt. Would that be a good choicep

Negative 10701 pI have an ASP application sitting on 2 servers, using a db in SQL Server 2012.  The SQL Server uses AlwaysOn Availability groups but when these failover the client connecting to the ASP.NET application terminates.  I have looked into the SQL driver which as it turns out the app is using SqlClasses so not using ODBC driver from what I have deduced I presume that logic is sound but correct me if Im wrong.p  pAnother suggestion has been made that I load balance the 2 app servers and that will seamlessly allow failover underneath without the client loosing connection, is this a viable way to go  We dont have much control over the applications code to ask it to try the connection again after failing....p  pMany thanks in advance. p

Locking a stream to a file on the file system andp  precodefileStream.seekg0, stdiosbeg int beginning  fileStream.tellg codepre  pyields 0. Thats to be expected, we use the benefits of zerobased counting.

The last position within the file loaded. So any buffer used to read in the stream would only get 511 bytes, rather than 512 bytes.p  pBut it works, so you can see my confusion. What gives Im at a loss. Where does the 1 comep

Negative 10701 pIm trying to write an rspec test for a custom redirect page in Rails. Basically Ive got a wildcard match in routes.rb that gets a page name, and a show method in a Pages controller that checks if a partial by that name exists. If it doesnt find a matching partial, it renders a 404 page and sets the status to 404. All this works in the browser, however rspec sees it as a 200 OK response, not a 404.p  pThe code Pages controller show method partialexists is a private method that Ive thoroughly tested, and I can verify using the test logs that missing.html.erb is being rendered as expected when rspec runsp  precodedef show   pagename  params[pagename].tos.gsubW,   unless partialexistspagename     render partial gt missing, status gt notfound   end end codepre  proutes.rbp  precodematch  gt pagesshow, pagename gt index match pagename gt pagesshow codepre  pspecp  precoderequire spechelper  describe PagesController do  renderviews    describe get page name of request do     it should generate http success for a defined partial do       visit        response.should besuccess     end      it should give respond with the 404 missing page for an undefined partial do       visit blahblahblah       response.status.should be404     end   end  end codepre  pThe first test runs as expected, and renders index.html.erb partial with a status code of 200.

When I run it in the browser, it renders missing.html.erb with a status code 404.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 10701 pI have a script that is running two commands.  The first command is writing data to a temp file.  The second command is piping to awk while the first command is running in the background.  awk, in the second command, needs to read the data from the temp file, but its parsing its own data faster than data is getting written to the temp file.p  pHeres an examplep  precodebinbash  command1 gt tmpdata.txt amp  command1 takes several minutes to run, so start command 2 while it runs in the background command2  awk      SEARCH          Matched input so pull next line from temp file         getline templine lt tmpdata.txt       codepre  pThis works, unless awk parses the data from command2 so fast that command1 cant keep up with it.  I.e. awk is getting an EOF from tmpdata.txt before command1 has finished writing to it.p  pIve also tried wrapping some checks around getline, likep  precodewhile getline templine lt tmpdata.txt lt 0      systemsleep 1  let command1 write more to the temp file   Keep processing now that we have read the next line codepre  pBut I think once it hits an EOF in the temp file, it stops trying to read from it.  Or something like that.p  pThe overall script works as long as command1 writes to the temp file faster than awk tries to read from it.  If I put a sleep 10 command between the two commands, then the temp file builds enough buffer and the script produces the output I need.  But I may be parsing files much larger than what Ive tested on, or the commands might run at different speeds on different systems, etc, so Id like a safety mechanism to wait for the file until data has been written to it.p  pAny ideas how I can do thisp

I have set IsBodyHtml to true. It sends it fine. No problems at all. p  pWithin the HTML code however I want to insert some fields that are relevant to each customer.p  pWhen I put set codeETicket.Body code to the HTML Code I get a number of errors because words such as Width and Height etc are being picked up as VB words.p  pAs a short term fix so I could test that the HTML body actually works I put the code into a rich text box and then set codeETicket.Body  RichTextBox1.Textcode . It works, but doesnt have the data in it that I want.p  pThe data relevant to each customer is held in an array. Any idea how I can get the HTML code to be accepted by VB Or how I can get my data from the array into the relevant position in the rich text boxp  pThankyoup  pJoe p

Negative 10701 p2 months ago I have asked about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14934809randommissingtypemapconfigurationorunsupportedmappingerrorinautomap titleRandom Missing Type Map Configuration Or Unsupported Mapping Errorthis problema and the problem still exists.p  pI am not going to copypaste the same problem here because I found out that the error is not for a specific EntityDTO mapping but for any EntityDTO which is first in a controller. p  pI mean if the program flow hits to a CountryCountryDto, the error saysp  precodeMissing type map configuration or unsupported mapping.

And then, at a random time, it happens again.p  pIf this problem happened only in development environment it wouldnt be a big deal but after publishing the problem was still there so I am in big trouble.p  pI have searched through Google, Stackoverflow, Automapper ForumsGroups with no success.p  pI have also tested the mappings with Mapper.AssertConfigurationIsValid and everything was fine.p  pMy project is an MVC 3 project with Automapper 2.2 and Unity IoC..p  pAgain, I will appreciate any idea, advice or solution.p  pstrongEditstrong OK, now I have a clue..

Negative 10701 pI need to generate and issue a token to clients based on usernamepassword authentication.  Ive tried several approaches to solving this problem, but all of them have run into issues.p  pMy first plan was to implement WSTrust Issue on my WCF endpoint.  The example I found which did this usedp  precode[OperationContractAction  httpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502trustRSTIssue,                    ReplyAction  httpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502trustRSTRIssue] Message IssueTokenMessage rstMessage codepre  pHowever, the changes to WIF in 4.5 to integrate it into the .NET Framework proper have broken the rest of the sample code to convert Message into RequestSecurityToken.  WSTrustRequestSerializer seems to do this, but it requires WSTrustSerializationContext, and theres little information on how to create or configure this context object.p  pI tried simply serializing out the JWT I want to use for my SecurityToken type into a string and returning it to the client, but it looks like deserializing it into a SecurityToken which WCF can use would require me to ship the JWTSecurityToken and Handler on the client, something I want to avoid.  While the WSTrust bindings seem to sidestep this somehow and produce a GenericXmlSecurityToken, I cant seem to find how to create one of these myself.p  pAny thoughts on either how to serializedeserialize the RequestSecurityToken and RequestSecurityTokenResponse objects within WSTrust, or how to serializedeserialize the token outside of the WSTrust framework  Or other ideasp

Negative 10701 pI have a large page with hundreds of Tiles, and hovering over each tile reveals a Flyout.  The Flyout will contain more information and markup than the Tile.p  pSince the Flyouts arent displayed initially, the easiest implementation is to set codedisplay nonecode on the Flyouts, and then toggle when the Tile is hovered.p  pHowever, Im concerned about this approach, because it means the DOM will still contain all Flyouts.  Ive heard, repeatedly, that a large DOM has a significant performance impact on Browsers, especially Mobile Browsers.p  pSo, Ive also considered another approach using JavaScript to codedetachcode all Flyouts from the DOM on page load.  Then, as Tiles are hovered, the Flyout will be reattached.  This presents a higher level of complexity, but page performance is crucial.p  pTo sum up my question  p  h3Is there a performance difference between codedisplay nonecode and codedetachcodeed elementsh3  pFor example, if the page had an animation, would the large nondisplayed DOM cause the animation to be more choppy than the slim DOMp

Negative 10701 pIm in a statistics class and we are constantly being given dice problems with various constrains.  This is a probability problem, where I need to evaluate the probability of an event by using the Monte Carlo method.

Simpler, cause I dont want to get carried away with my code writing abilities.p  pAssume that a dice have 9 sides each.

Negative 10701 pIve run into a slight issue  Im writing a program that loads DLLs, each of which contain a class which inherits from a class existing in a library referenced by both the loaded DLL and the host program that is loading the DLL. The issue here is that, when I try to load and cast to the superclassp  precodevar assembly  Assembly.LoadFromdllPath var type  assembly.GetTypes.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.IsSubclassOftypeof MySuperclass ... codepre  pAlthough both are referencing the class containing MySuperclass, since the dll is referencing the built class library a separate file from the class library file the loading program is referencing IsSubclassOf never returns true, because it considers the two classes to be different as they come from two different assemblies. p  pFurthermore, if you try casting a created instance of the loaded class to the superclass type, it cant do it since theyre not the same different assemblies.p  pSo, my question is stronghow do you handle loading assemblies which reference common code, so that c recognizes that youre loading a class which inherits from a common superclassstrongp

Negative 10701 pThis is a follow up question from a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16957151whenaviewcontrollerisdeallocdunderarcareitspropertiesalsodeallocprevious onea which may have included too much circumstantial detail.  Consider the following codep  pBarViewController.h  p  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt protocol SomeDelegate  voidsomeCallback  doesnt matter end  interface BarViewController  UIViewController  property weak, nonatomic id ltSomeDelegategt delegate  end codepre  pBarViewController.mp  precodeimport BarViewController.h  interface BarViewController   end  implementation BarViewController  end codepre  pFooViewController.hp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  interface FooViewController  UIViewController  end codepre  pFooViewController.mp  precodeimport FooViewController.h import BarViewController.h  interface FooViewController  ltSomeDelegategt end  implementation FooViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     BarViewController bar  [[BarViewController alloc] init]      does this assignment create a strong reference i.e. increase retain count by 1     bar.delegate  self      do some useful stuff with bar.delegate here      bar  nil  is memory for bar.delegate freed here,      or only after this instance of FooViewController is destroyed   pragma mark  SomeDelegate  voidsomeCallback   doesnt matter   end codepre  pImagine that codeFooViewControllercode was the main view controller in some small application, and that codeBarViewControllercode was just some shortlived thing, maybe designed to let the user select one of a few buttons.  codeBarViewControllercode reports back what was selected via its delegate.  p  pIn my code above, when I set codebarcode to codenilcode in codeFooViewController.mcode, what happens to the memory that was set aside for codebar.delegatecode  On one hand, I am thinking that setting codebarcode to codenilcode might cause codebar.delegatecode to also be set to codenilcode as a part of the codebarcode object being deallocated.  On the other hand, my understanding of a codeweakcode reference is that the memory is only released once there is no longer anybody pointing strongly to it.  So if codebar.delegate  selfcode creates a strong reference to codedelegatecode does it, is it possible that codebar.delegatecode somehow still holds a pointer to our instance of codeFooViewControllercode, even though codebarcode is now codenilcode  Is there any potential for a memory leak here    p  pstrongEditstrongbr So the way Im thinking about this is, codeUIWindowcode would point strongly to our instance of codeFooViewControllercode as the root view controller, and our instance of BarViewController would point weakly to our instance of codeFooViewControllercode as its delegate.  So even when we set codebar  nilcode, codebar.delegatecode weakly points to an object that still has at least one strong pointer coming from codeUIWindowcode, so codebar.delegatecode cant be freed based on the a weak property is freed when nobody else points strongly to it premisep

What I need to do is strip the target attribute from all links within the iframe so all links stay within the iframe rather than opening a new window or tab.p  pIt seems like there should be a simple javascript solution to this.p  pIf I cant get this to work in an iframe then I will be forced to recreate all the content on my site which would be very painful..... to say the least.p  pAny helpp

Negative 10701 pI hear of advice of making the code.hiddencode class not as ap  precode.hidden  display none  codepre  pbut make it width and height of 1, and using clipping, etc, to make the element as if it still exist on screen but the content is just not visible.p  pBut isnt it true that when we use JavaScript to hide something, the purpose of that element is done, and we want it to not show on the screen and not visible to the screen reader eitherp  pCase 1 For example, if it is an input box, and inside the box there is a grey line of text Enter keyword.  When the user actually clicks on, or keydown, or using the codeinputcode event, now we have a JavaScript handler to hide the Enter keyword text, because it is just a grey prompt inside the input box.  In this case, shouldnt the text be completely hidden, using in fact a codedisplay nonecode, so that even screen reader cant read it  the user have learned enough to start typing, so the prompt shouldnt really still be there to be read by screen reader, rightp  pCase 2 If it is a pop up bubble, for error message, or there is a link enter your email for our subscription, and it will pop up a bubble, then when the bubble is closed, shouldnt the bubble be really closed totally using codedisplay nonecode  The screen reader shouldnt really still be able to read those content out for a bubble that is done and closed.p  pCase 3 The only case I can think of is a small fraction that the hidden should be available to a screen reader is it is for a bubble for extra information, such as for the product rating how many stars out of 5, or extra help info that can pop up when the mouse hover over  some  icon or link.  But even in this case, wont screen readers actually read out link to more info or link to show rating, that is in the codealtcode or codetitlecode of the tag, and not read the pop up info until the user pops it openp  pSo my question is shouldnt there be really two types of hidden.  One is codedisplay nonecode type that screen reader shouldnt see make it the code.hiddencode class, and the other is codewidth 1px height 1pxcode that the screen reader can see or will read out make this the code.a11yhiddencode class, and whether type 2 might be far less often than type 1p

Negative 10701 pIm attempting to build an open source a hrefhttpsgithub.comtimmolterDatasets relnofollowprojecta to provide easy access to machine learning datasets, which bundles the data in an easily accessible way. Basically, I have code, which converts the raw data into a codeHSQLDBcode codefilecode DB, producing code.datacode, code.propertiescode, and code.scriptcode files. I then take those 3 files, put them in codesrcmainresourcescode of my codeMavencode project and build a jar. Applications depending on this jar can then access the codeHSQLDBcode database as a coderescode database.p  pTechnically, I have no problems getting all the pieces in place to accomplish this. However, accessing the data is extremely slow. The strange thing is though, that if I have the datasets project and a project depending on datasets both open in Eclipse and run it from there, its fast as one would expect. This means that the problem has to do with the codeHSQLDBcode files being jarred up. Another clue, is that the larger the DB, the seemingly exponentially longer it takes to access the data.p  pIve tried bumping of the memory and perm space given as JVM args. Ive also tried setting various codeHSQLDBcode flags in the the code.propertiescode file as well.p  pAny ideasp  pEdit I also have jar compression turned off using the codeltcompressgtfalseltcompressgtcode element in the mavenjarplugin definition.p

Negative 10701 pI am trying to hold to the DRY principle in developing WCF services for our application, but I seem to be going down a lot of rabbit holes.  My original idea was to have an abstract base class to hold code common to all services, and have derived classes for each concrete service, but cannot seem to get VS2012 to play nice.p  pWhenever you create a service class, it INSISTS on putting the contract interface and implementation classes in the same project, and trying to pull those apart seems to hose up the wiring that VS has done under the hood, so then things break.p  pI guess all my years of classic OO design are getting in the way, I wanted to have the concrete services derive from the interface class AND the abstract base class, but Im not having a lot of luck.  I have found questionsblogs on having polymorphic DATA types used by services, but have not found examples of polymorphic SERVICE types.  Can anyone point mep  pThanks, Peterp  pUPDATE Perhaps I am overthinking the whole thing, I am actually NOT trying to have inheritance for OPERATIONS since a composite approach would make more sense, I just want to keep common code in one place obviously..., and the whole static helper class approach always feels dirty to me, kind of defeating the whole OO approach...I am hoping I can simply have the contrete service classes inherit from an abstract base class that is NOT necessarily the implementation of any particular service contract, but is just a way to keep the code DRY...p  pALSO I am trying to use the Template pattern for the service classes, since the overall structure of the services is so similar devil is always in the details...p

Negative 10701 pI am experiencing freeze issues with Visual Studio if I leave the debugger at a breakpoint overnight and then return the next day to continue i.e. F10.p  pWhat happens is that not only Visual Studio freezes but the entire computer hangs as well forcing me to restart. This occurs on a quad core computer which means VS is basically occupying the CPU for all cores. p  pIs there something I can do with stupid bugs like this or do I really have to avoid leaving a debugging process stop at a breakpoint for an extended period of time I actually do need to do something like this because there are times itd take hours for a certain break point to hit.p  pThanks.p  pEdit I am debugging a local project that connects to a remote SQL server. I never have problem with it if I leave the breakpoint for an hour or so. The freeze only occurs when I leave it overnight.p  pEdit2 Problem also occurs if I kill the debugger instead of continuing with it after an overnight breakpoint.p
Negative 10701 pCurrently running SQL 2005 on Server 2005. I have a TSQL script which updates 1000 rows at a time. It loops through a counter until there are no rows to update. p  pIn my situation, I have a lot of rows to update and I need to run this after hours. So I would like to see if there is a way that I can schedule a way to automatically start and stop a task based upon a set time.

Negative 10701 pI am trying to get a jQuery function to slide li items left and right by clicking an arrow. I am using a jQuery script called TinyCarousel.js. While I have it functioning properly, it continues to scroll right until the last li item is in the first position. What I have currently can be seen a hrefhttpmmoaggro.com relnofollowherea in the Games Currently Testing or Releasing section under the main slider. If you scroll all the way to the right you will notice the issue.p  pIs it possible to either...p  p1 Change the jQuery to make the last li item stop once it is showing all the way on the right side of the window I know this would have to be relative to the browser window size as well as make one single partial movement incase the window size has a partial item showing. I also know I would have to know the amount of li items which I can do within the php.p  p2 Or two, append the li continually so that the slider never seems to end. Just continues through repeating over and over I would guess that I need to continually append li items as well as remove them if they are off screen. p  pI attempted to create a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netPelligea82fdK relnofollowjFiddlea to show the issue. But it is doing something all together different on jFiddle which is closer to what I need. It seems to stop moving right at some point. But it does not need the entire last li to display completely. What is it doing differently than what I have on the live site where it does stopp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.

Negative 10701 pI have my ViewModels inside a PCL, because Im developing a Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone app in parallel.  I have a list of things inside my ViewModel as an ObservableCollection.p  pI have a GridView inside a Page inside a Windows 8.1 project.  I wish to incrementally load items from my list of things in my ViewModel.  Normally I would implement ISupportIncrementalLoading inside a custom subclass of ObservableCollection, however, given that my ViewModel is inside a PCL, ISupportIncrementalLoading is not available its not supported by WP8.p  pSo my question is, does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can create some kind of converter, adapter or abstraction layer between the ItemsSource binding of the GridView and the Observable Things property of my ViewModel which would implement ISupportIncrementalLoading and then call the ViewModels LoadMoreThings method and pass the items to the GridView.p  pI feel like there is some solution, such as creating a custom ISupportIncrementalLoading inside my View Models PCL and then have the View layer delegate to it.p  pthanksp

Negative 10701 pI have a WCF service hosted in IIS 7.p  pWhen I installed it on my server I created a new site, application and application pool in IIS.

A Microsoft article explains the error as The communication link between the driver and the data source to which the driver was attempting to connect failed before the SQLDriverConnect function completed processing.  Some research on that specifically points to lack of SSL support in FreeTDS, but Im unclear how to verify that has been enabled. p  pI will using either PHP Data Objects or mssql functions to connect to the SQL Azure database. Im less familiar with PDO, but it seems that PDO does not necessarily use ODBC Im quite unclear on that, and I suspect its leading me to troubleshoot problems seen by isql that are unrelated to the problems Im seeing in PHP. Do connectivity problems with the isql tool relate to connectivity problems in either PDO or mssql functions in PHPp  pMy latest attempt, using PDO, isp  precodeltphp  c  new PDOodbcDriverFreeTDSPort1433Serversssssssssss.database.windows.netDatabasedbxxxxxxxxxxxUIDdbxxxxxxxxxxxExternalWriterPWDppppppppp  gt codepre  pThis code generates the following errors in my Apache log filep  blockquote   p[Tue Dec 24 132310 2013] [error] [client 10.1.1.11] PHP Fatal error   Uncaught exception PDOException with message SQLSTATE[08S01]   SQLDriverConnect 20004 [unixODBC][FreeTDS][SQL Server]Read from the   server failed in varwwwtestpdo.php3nStack tracen0   varwwwtestpdo.php3 PDOconstructodbcDriverFre...n1   mainn  thrown in varwwwtestpdo.php on line 3p blockquote  pMy etcfreetdsfreetds.confp  precode[global]          TDS protocol version         tds version  9.1           Whether to write a TDSDUMP file for diagnostic purposes          setting this to tmp is insecure on a multiuser system         dump file  tmpfreetds.log         debug flags  0xffff           Command and connection timeouts                timeout  10                connect timeout  10           If you get outofmemory errors, it may mean that your client          is trying to allocate a huge buffer for a TEXT field.

Negative 10701 pI have situation where I have an MKMapView that takes up the full view of my xib file. Over the top of this at the left hand side of the xib I have a tableView. p  pIm adding a number of annotations to my map, which is fine, and then the map is centered so these are all in view. The problem I have is that the map is centered based on the size of the whole view. What I would like to do is center the region in the visible part of the map  so basically add an offset that is the size of the tableViews frame. The reason the mapView takes up the whole size of the view is that the tableView can be dismissed so the user views the map full screen.  The tableView doesnt start at 0,0 and take up the whole height so you can see the map behind it which is why I dont just make the maps frame larger when dismissing the table view.p  pIve been trying to use p  precode  [mapView convertPointpoint toCoordinateFromViewmapView] codepre  pand then try and work out the difference between my currently selected region but this doesnt seem to be working. p  pAny help appreciatedp  precode   CGPoint offset  CGPointMaketableView.frame.size.width,self.tableView.frame.size.height      CLLocationCoordinate2D movedLocation [self.mapView convertPointoffset toCoordinateFromViewself.mapView]    Not sure what I should do here     hardCodedLocation.latitude  hardCodedLocation.latitude  hardCodedLocation.latitude  movedLocation.latitude      CLLocationDistance zoom  900000     [self.mapView setRegionMKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistancehardCodedLocation, zoom, zoom animatedYES ] codepre

Negative 10701 ptldr What is the fastest way to sort an uint8x16tp  pI need to sort many arrays of exactly 16 unsigned bytes in descending order, which doesnt matter, of course, and im trying to optimize sorting by means of ARM NEON vectorization.p  pAnd i find it to be quite a fancy puzzle, as it seems that there must exist a short combination of NEON instructions such as vmaxvpmaxvminvpmin, vzipvuzp that reliably results in a sorted array.p  pFor example, if we transform a pair A, B of two 8byte arrays into vpmaxA,B, vpminA,B, we obtain same 16 values, just in different order. If we repeat this operation emfour timesem, we reliably have the array maximum in the first cell and the array minimum in the last cell we cannot be sure about the middle elements though.p  pAnother example if we first do C,DvmaxA,B,vminA,B, then we do E,FvpmaxC,D,vpminC,D, then we do G,HvzipE,F, then we get our array split into four parts of four bytes, in each part we already know the largest element and the smallest element. Probably the next naive step would be to deinterleave this array to have top four bytes at start of the array which wont necessary be the top 4 elements of the array, just top bytes of their respective groups and repeat, not yet sure where it leads at the end.p  pIs there any known method for this particular problem or for other similar problems for different array sizes or whatever Any ideas are appreciated p

The entire implementation is herep  precodeimport scala.util.parsing.combinator.  trait Ops    type Op  Float,Float gt Float    def addx Float, y Float  x  y   def subx Float, y Float  x  y   def mulx Float, y Float  x  y   def divx Float, y Float  x  y   trait PolishParser extends Ops with JavaTokenParsers      Converts a floating point number as a String to Float   def num Parser[Float]  floatingPointNumber  .toFloat    Parses an operator and converts it to the underlying function it logically maps to   def operator Parser[Op]               case  gt add     case  gt sub     case  gt mul     case  gt div       trait PolishSemantics extends PolishParser     def polishParser[Float]  repnum  operator   xs gt reducexs.head     def pop2xsList[Float],fOp  xs take 2 reduce f  xs drop 2    def reduceinputList[Any],stackList[Float]  NilList[Float]  input match      case fOp  xs gt reducexs,pop2stack,f     case xFloat  xs gt reducexs,x  stack     case Nil gt stack     case  gt sys.errorUnexpected input       class PolishInterpreter extends PolishParser with PolishSemantics     Parse an expression and return the calculated result as a String   def interpretexpression String  parseAllpolish, expression   object Calculator extends PolishSemantics     def mainargs Array[String]      val pi  new PolishInterpreter     printlninput   args0     printlnresult   pi.interpretargs0      codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is to not use the typepattern in the reduce function. One solution is of course to make a custom type hierarchy in the following sensep  precodetrait Elem case class FloatingfFloat extends Elem case class Operatoro Float,Float gt Float extends Elem codepre  pBy this, I would be able to use pattern matching on caseclasses through their unapply methods, but this would also require extensive refactoring of the code. One other approach could be to apply the semantics directly while parsing, which would allow me to use only a stack of floats and then deal with operators immediately after parsing them. This would of course totally ruin the declarative fashion in which the parsercombinators work and would be a crime against everything that is good in the world.p  pI realize, of course, that this is nitpicking, but inside everyone is a software engineer trying to get out, and I am ready for that last suggestion to make the example perfect. Any ideas p

Negative 10701 pI have a network that is defined by a matrix, where [i,j] element in the matrix is the cost of getting from node i to node j. If there is no path between i and j then [i,j] is Infinite.p  pI fill up the matrix with the negative values, so that if the distance between i and j is short then I put very small value in [i,j], for example 50, if the distance is long I put bigger value, for example 5.p  pI wonder how its possible to find partial shortest path in network, the only constrains is the path should go in the predefined order, just like elements occur in matrix i,i1,i2,..p  pfor simplified example,p  precode     1   2   3  4   5     1  0  20        10   2       0              3          0           4             0  50   5                      codepre  pHere, the complete path form 1to5 equals 10, but if we take path 1to2 and then 4to5 we get better score 50, so here we skipped 3 and its ok for partial path.p  pSo the partial path  is a path that doesnt have to visit every node, it might be just short segment 1to2, bu the shortest partial path has to the shortest among all partial paths.p  pThe constraint about the order is very simple, we always start searching path from node 1 and go in ascending order, so for all segments [i,j] [i1,j1] in the paths, ji and i1j.p  pI wonder if there is a good way to find best score partial path in the network,  I think exhaustive search is also good solution, the number of nodes is around 1520.p

Negative 10701 pI am trying to decode a JSON array and put it in a slice of a struct. Ive read how to do this, but only if the JSON array contains keys. My JSON array does not contain keys. p  pI have stripped the program down to only the part where it handles the JSON data. It compiles and can be found below. p  precodepackage main   20140419  import      fmt     encodingjson   type itemdata struct      data1 int  I have tried making these strings     data2 int     data3 int   func main      datas  []itemdata      json.Unmarshal[]byte[[7293,1434,99646],[4657,1051,23795]], ampdatas      I have tried the JSON string without the qoutes around the numbers     fmt.Printlnlendatas  This prints 2     fmt.PrintlnThis prints  This does print      for i  range datas          fmt.Printlndatas[i].data1   This prints 0, two times           fmt.PrintlnAnd so does this  This does print  codepre  pIve searched for things like Go Lang JSON decode without keys and read articles and package pages on the Go Lang website. I can find enough information on how to work with Go and JSON, but none of my found articles explain how to do it without keys in the JSON array. p  pI wouldnt find it odd if I would get an error The JSON values are stringynumbers thats how I get them as input, but I am trying to put them in integers. I am not getting an error though. I have tried making the values in the itemdata struct strings, that didnt help much. Removing the quotes from the JSON values didnt help either. p  pI would like to know how I can make my JSON array in a slice of itemdata. The first out of three values would go into itemdata.data1, the second in itemdata.data2 and the third in itemdata.data3.p  pPlease let me know if you think I can improve my question. p  pThanks in advance,br Remip

But the game has already minimized and stopped processing by the time the UpdateState finishes.p  pI have tried to use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.autoresetevent.aspx relnofollowSystem.Threading.Autoreseteventa but this does not work. I was also looking at normal threading, but found many warnings about Unity not being thread safe so didnt continue on that road.p  pHow can I make the game wait for this finished signal before minimizing or save the data in the backgroundp  pOnApplicationPause says something about use as a coroutine, this might be an answer but Im not sure how I would use this.p

Negative 10701 pSo iv been doing a lot of reading on the best way to validate an email address before submitting a form. Iv read in multiple areas that regular expressions shouldnt be used to validate email addresses. e.g.p  pa hrefhttpwww.regularexpressions.infoemail.html relnofollowhttpwww.regularexpressions.infoemail.htmlap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions46155validateemailaddressinjavascriptValidate email address in JavaScriptap  pmy problem with using regular expressions is that I need to be able to allow foreign characters in emails as they could be coming from anywhere in the world and I dont know how to ensure they are allowed without spending an age setting up useless accounts to test.p  pFurther into my reading I saw someone state that validation should be done server side as well.p  pAll I get in search results for serverside validation are links to regular expressions. p  pIve also looked at simple validation using indexOf and lastIndexOf on certain characters but I dont see how that will allow all the possible domains without some crazy complex code.p  pSo essentially my question is what are the options for severside validation other than again using regular expressions if there are any other optionsp  pAppreciate any helpp

Negative 10701 pHi fellow developers,p  pIm suprised that I didnt find any information on that particular use case for iOS 8. Let me explain, I have a navigation controller stack, the first view has its navigationBar hidden, when the user clicks on a cell a new view is pushed and I need the navigation bar shown on this view to go back obviously. On iOS 7 it was just a matter of adding this line in viewWillAppear  p  precode [self.navigationController setNavigationBarHiddenNO animatedYES] codepre  pAnd it works like a charm. But as of iOS 8 Im struggling to have the same behavior. For now I managed to do the same by using p  precode voidviewDidLayoutSubviews      [super viewDidLayoutSubviews]     if SYSTEMVERSIONGREATERTHANOREQUALTO8.0         [self.navigationController setNavigationBarHiddenNO animatedNO]   voidviewDidLoad       [super viewDidLoad]      if SYSTEMVERSIONGREATERTHANOREQUALTO8.0           self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets  NO          self.edgesForExtendedLayout  UIRectEdgeNone          self.collectionView.contentInset  UIEdgeInsetsMakeself.navigationController.navigationBar.frame.size.height, 0, 0, 0      codepre  pAnd changing the contentInset of my collectionsView  tableviews whatever I need to display. Itll work, but its a real pain in the emem sometimes the content inset isnt necessary if the user comes from a new viewcontroller.p  pFor context the project was first developed to handle iOS 6 and 7, so no storyboard, all is done programmatically. I ported the app to a more modern codebase and made it universal.p  pAm I missing something  Is there a better way to handle that in iOS 78 p

Negative 10701 pI want to write a own rewrite rule into my htacces. The redirection itself works fine but Wordpress validates the URI with codeSERVER[REQUIREURI]code. So the site Title is Changed automatically to page not found, the loop doesnt works and so on.p  pIs there anyway to do this p  pIf not is there a other possibility actually I only need a really simple redirect from codewww.example.comtestcode to codewww.example.comt.phpa1code So its completely static i dont need patterns at all. I have already tried it with frameset but that looks pretty ugly and makes the process slow.p  pThank you very muchp  pJakobp  pMy .htaccess filep  precode BEGIN WordPress ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt RewriteEngine On RewriteBase    My Rules RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule Malta httpwww.reisekontrast.deIndexmalta1  [QSA,L] RewriteRule China httpwww.reisekontrast.deIndexchina1  [QSA,L]    WP Rules RewriteRule index.php  [L] RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . index.php [L]  ltIfModulegt   END WordPress codepre

I believe this has to do with the word strongfirststrong emphasis mine above, since now the emclassnameem codeBcode, in the declaration codestruct B pcode is no more its first declaration strongin its declarative regionstrong. Am I correct saying thisp  pAssuming my interpretation is correct, why is it that the emclassnameem codeBcode is not injected in the global namespace in this case Note that the nested class codestruct Bcode will be hidden inside A in this case, i.e., even if we change the declaration of function codefcode to codevoid fABampcode the code wont compile. p  pThere is still one other point that isnt clear to me what made the implementers to decide for the classname injection into the namespace, or block scope, containing the elaboratedtypespecifier, in the second bullet point above That is, why didnt they leave the classname declaration inside the class scopep
Negative 10701 pIm using Xamarin Studio and developing a small test project for Android.p  pI have an strongActivitystrong with three strongTabsstrong on it, each Tab have a different strongFragmentstrong. So far I got the hang of how to add strongTabsstrong and event handlers.p  pBut when I rotate the screen, the default strongTabstrong I set is selected which causes the strongFragmentstrong assigned to that strongTabstrong to be displayed.p  pAnother problem I face is that when I change strongTabsstrong, I want to preserve the state of the previous strongTabstrong, so when I select it again it wont be rendered again.

Negative 10701 pI have set up caching in Spring 4 using codeltcacheannotationdriven gtcode and declaring a corresponding cache manager, codeEhCacheCacheManagercode in my case. Everything works fine.p  pNow I would now like to have a property in config file, that tells whether the cache should be working or not, e.g. codecache.enabled  truecode. The properties are also managed by Spring. p  pOfficial doc says the following about disabling cachep  blockquote   pIt is important to note that even though declaring the cache   annotations does not automatically trigger their actions  like many   things in Spring, the feature has to be declaratively enabled which   means if you ever suspect caching is to blame, you can disable it by   removing only one configuration line rather then all the annotations   in your code.p blockquote  pBut thats not exactly what I want. Is there a simple way to turn caching on and off without altering the Springs configurationp

Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.            If the persistent store is not accessible, there is typically something wrong with the file path. Often, a file URL is pointing into the applications resources directory instead of a writeable directory.

It employs a comprehensive curriculum that seeks to develop the whole childintellectually, physically, spiritually, socially, aesthetically, and emotionally. Teachers and students in Coast Middle School hold themselves and each other to the highest expectations. The Middle School academically challenges its students in foreign language, math, social studies, language arts, and science, while at the same nurturing emotional and creative development through our acclaimed fine arts and athletic programs.ltpgt  ltpgtCoast Middle School is developmentally responsive to the needs of its students. The Middle School provides the students with teachers and specialized professionals who are readily available to offer the assistance students need in negotiating their lives, both in and out of school. As a complement to their academic classes, students discuss issues relevant to their lives through our comprehensive character education and guidance curriculum. The studentled vestry program allows the students to develop a sense of leadership and responsibility as they aid the chaplain in the development of chapel messages.ltpgt  ltpgtCoast Middle School seeks to conceptualize and promote the healthy growth of young adolescents as ethical citizens and increasingly competent, selfsufficient young people who are optimistic about the future. To achieve these goals the Middle School is structured on a team concept. Each grade level is split into two teamsblue and white, representing our school colorsconsisting of four academic core classes. Coast Middle School believes academic success and personal growth increase markedly when young adolescents affective needs are met. Therefore, all adults in the Middle School are advocates, advisors, and mentors for each student. Each team works together on servicelearning activities and experiential learning opportunities.ltpgt  ltpgtCoast Middle School feels strongly that the most successful learning strategies are ones that involve each student personally. Therefore, we offer afterschool tutorials so students can get personalized help with homework or as preparation for a test or quiz. Other afterschool possibilities include intramurals, clubs, and an Extended Day Program, which runs until 600 p.m. Students are also encouraged to participate on school athletic teams. Students in both grades can participate in drama performances.ltpgt  ltpgtCoast Middle School is also actively invested in the impact media and digital activities have on our students lives. Students in both grades participate in a Digital Citizenship curriculum provided by Common Sense Media, which encourages them to be safe, responsible, and savvy citizens of the digital world.ltpgt  ltpgtltstronggtSeventh Gradeltstronggt While enjoying a similar daily schedule in seventh grade, the students make a choice from four languages Chinese, French, Latin, or Spanish for daily study. Additionally they choose one elective see course descriptions. The seventh grade takes a class trip to Washington, D.C. Each of the three sports seasons includes at least one nocut sport.ltpgt  ltpgtltstronggtEighth Gradeltstronggt The daily class schedule includes civics, physical science, algebra or geometry, and English. Interdisciplinary activities include Mock Congress and a social issues research project. All classes emphasize critical and creative thinking. The focus of this grade is leadership training and service learning, as well as preparation to move successfully into the Upper School. The eighth grade travels to New York City in the spring.ltpgt  ltpgtStudents in both grades have a morning fruit break and break for a brief recess to socialize and develop friendships that are vital in the development of a young adolescent. Band, chorus, and orchestra are offered in bith grades, along with visual and theater arts opportunities.ltpgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 10701 pI am trying to wrap my head around this. I have a codeQObjectcode derived class being used in QML, it has a codeint lengthcode member and a corresponding codelengthcode property.p  p90 of the times in QML Id set the property via a binding codelength 50code or codelength someJSExpressioncode, and in both cases the value is being determined by an expression, be that a trivial in the case of code50code.p  pBut what does this mean That the underling codeintcode remains unused and instead of reading the value from it, it is being evaluated from the bound expression, or that the expression is evaluated and the value is stored into the member, and then read from it p  pIn the first case the member would simply take up space without being used producing memory consumption overhead, in the second case the overhead will come from the redundant writeread instead of directly using the value from the expression without caching it in the member.p  pOn a deeper level, the question would extend to how bindings, which are purely QML thing and not used in the C API work, whether they substitute the underlying property member or work in tandem with it and the defined or implicit getter method.p  pAlso, is there a room for eliminating the overhead in the fist case I mean it is possible to implement a readonly property that doesnt use any underlying member and the getter method evaluates an expression to determine it, but in those cases in QML it wont be possible to use the other form, i.e. codelength  50code that imply sets the value rather than binding an expression to itp

Negative 10701 pSo I have the same issue as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10867323delegateclasswithoutdefaultconstructorherea and a hrefhttpgroovy.329449.n5.nabble.comDelegateaclasswithoutadefaultconstructortd5710078.html relnofollowherea. I have classes codeAcode and codeBcode. codeAcode shall be decorated by codeBcode. To save my some typing, I use the codedelegatecode groovy annotation so that groovy handles all the calls to codeBcodes methods and automatically deligates them to an codeAcode type object that is saved in codeBcode.p  pThis works fine, however I do not get any help from compiler. If I try codemyB.someMethodOfClassAcode then the compiler is not smart enough to figure out, that this method call will be delegated to codeAcode and that such a method is present in codeAcode, so it marks it as not found  at runtime it will still work.p  pI can workaround that by having codeBcode also extends from codeAcode. However, then codeAcodes defaultconstructor is called when initializing B and if there is none, it fails of course.p  pOne clean solution would be to create an codeAInterfacecode and let codeAcode and codeBcode implement it. Is there another clean way of doing what I want without having to create an interface all the time I might even not be able to do that if codeAcode is not under my controlp  pHere is an example with inheritationp  precodepublic class OldClass      public String name     public OldClassString name  this.name  name      public sayHello  println hello name   codepre  pThe following class should be able to be used like the oldClass but add another methodp  precodepublic class NewClass      Delegate OldClass delegationForOldClass      public NewClassString name  this.delegationForOldClass  new OldClassname      public sayGoodbye  println byebye   codepre  pI can now use it like thisp  precodeNewClass myNewClass  NewClassJames myNewClass.sayHello prints hello James because the Delegation annotation delegates the call to the OldClass object myNewClass.sayGoodbye prints bye codepre  pSo it compiles and works at runtime even though I am not extending the codeOldClasscode here because of the annotation. However the IDE compiler complains at compile time when I go for codemyNewClass.sayHellocode that codesayHellocode might not be there. He also does not tell me this method when using code completion. So to be able to use code completion I can do it like thatp  precodepublic class NewClass extends OldClass      Delegate OldClass delegationForOldClass      public newClassString name  this.delegationForOldClass  new OldClassname      public sayGoodbye  println byebye   codepre  pThis however only works of codeOldClasscode has an empty constructor. But it doesnt, it has only a constructor which takes a string. So groovy tries to call the default constructor because of the extends keyword it is the same in java right and of course fails. If I add an defaul constructor to codeOldClasscode then it will work, but I dont want to do that.p  pIs there any way to work around this behaviourp

Now we want to perform the codespringbootruncode command from the working directory this master POM is in. Problem is, this generates a codeClassNotFoundExceptioncode which is odd since module1 where this codeApplicationcode class is located is included in the POM and mentioned as a module.p  pUsing a single module maven project and codeltpackaginggtjarltpackaginggtcode this compiles and runs the Application class so it is not SpringBoot that is not working right here.p  pWhat do I have to change to get this working or is it simply not possible to use the codespringbootmavenplugincode plugin when dealing with multi module Maven projectsp  hr  pSidenote My Application class  Module 1 has the other modules as dependencies so keep this in mind when answering the question.

Negative 10701 pWe have been working on a multiplayer game for mobile platform in Unity. For iOS we are using Game Center for the connectivity using a third party plugin. The multiplayer works fine when being tested locally on the same network. We have our team available in two different countries so when we try to test the same multiplayer game in the sandbox mode over two different networks then we are never able to connect with each other. Even at the same location with one device being connected to wifi and another to 3G, we confront the same issue.p  pWe couldnt find any concrete solution for the same so we opened a case with Apple to which they asked us to ping certain ip addresses which we were unable to succeed. They mentioned in the same email to remove the multiple NAT layers which we are really unable to do so. And since then we have been awaiting a concrete solution to be provided by Apple to resolve the issue.p  pWe were wondering if any of you have ever come across such a problem with Game Center sandbox mode unable to connect on different networks and was able to resolve the issue then please post the solution here.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 10701 pMy question was so long So I reduced.p  pIn scheme, usermade procedures consume more time than builtin procedures If boths functions are samep  pThis is my short version question. Below is long long version question.p  pEX 1.23 is problembelow, why the next procedure isnt twice faster than  1p  pThis is my guess.p  preason 1  next contains if specialform and it consumes time.p  preason 2  function call consumes time.p  pa hrefhttpcommunity.schemewiki.orgsicpex1.23 relnofollowhttpcommunity.schemewiki.orgsicpex1.23a says reason 1 is right.p  pAnd I want to know reason 2 is also right.p  pSO I rewrote the next procedure. I didnt use if and checked the number divided by 2 just once before use nextso next procedure only do  2. And I remeasured the time. It was more fast than before BUT still not 2. SO I rewrote again. I changed next to  num 2. Finally It became 2 or almost 2. And I thought why. This is why I guess the reason 2. I want to know what is correct answer.p  pps. Im also curious about why some primes are being tested very fast than others It doesnt make sense because if a number n is prime, process should see from 2 to sqrtn. But some numbers are tested faster. Do you know why some primes are tested faster  p  pExercise 1.23.  The smallestdivisor procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of needless testing After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers. This suggests that the values used for testdivisor should not be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this change, define a procedure next that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise returns its input plus 2. Modify the smallestdivisor procedure to use next testdivisor instead of  testdivisor 1. With timedprimetest incorporating this modified version of smallestdivisor, run the test for each of the 12 primes found in exercise 1.22. Since this modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to run about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed If not, what is the observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the fact that it is different from 2p  pWhere the book is  a hrefhttpmitpress.mit.edusicpfulltextbookbookZH11.htmlsec1.2.6 relnofollowhttpmitpress.mit.edusicpfulltextbookbookZH11.htmlsec1.2.6ap

But gives 502 error when run on staging which uses the production environment.  seeing the log it seems the query takes long time.

We also tried using the data at the staging and importing it in the local and development enviroment to see if it is the data size that is causing error, but it still works there.

Negative 10701 pIm setting up an application on Heroku that uses a MySQL database.p  pThe client would like to use a MySQL database that has an explicit whitelist that allows it to connect.

Negative 10701 pI am using a series of JavaScript functions to load information from a database and use the information in the creation of a thumbnail image and a radio button corresponding to each comic record that the user has theoretically created and uploaded to the database.p  pMy problem arises when the HTML tags are created. While the image and button are both created correctly with no errors, they are outputted in the wrong order. They should be loaded alphabetically by comicName, which is represented in the radio buttons text, for examplep  precodeComic A img Comic B img Comic C img codepre  pI have checked the array arr of comicIDs that determine the order of outputted html objects at several stages in the code using window alerts, and at all stages the comics are ordered correctly in the array, even when outputting incorrectly. There is an odd circumstance when I have quite a lot of alerts opening up at once the items DO in fact output in the correct order. In this case there were around six comicIDs in the array and each ID had an alert pop up for it at three different times.p  pI therefore think that the code is creating them in the correct order and trying to output them as such, but some items may be loading sooner than others due to image size or some other processing reason. If this is indeed the case how would I go about sorting it to make sure they load correctlyp  pThanks in advance.p  hr  pJavascriptp  precodeltscriptgt           Loads the users comic list from the database.         function loadComic                  var xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest         var getID  ltphp echo SESSION[userID] gt         var url  loadCom.phpuserIDgetID           xmlhttp.onreadystatechangefunction                      if xmlhttp.readyState  4 ampamp xmlhttp.status  200                              loadComicJSONxmlhttp.responseText                                xmlhttp.openGET, url, true         xmlhttp.send                     JSON parsing for loadComic.         function loadComicJSONresponse                      var arr  JSON.parseresponse             var i             var out                document.getElementByIdloadList.innerHTML              if arr.length  0                              document.getElementByIduploadTagID.innerHTML                 document.getElementByIduploadTagID.innerHTMLNo Comics Uploaded                 document.getElementByIdbtnDeleteComic.disabledtrue                 document.getElementByIdbtnEditComic.disabledtrue                 document.getElementByIdbtnDelAllComics.disabledtrue                 listButtons.hide                          else                                 document.getElementByIdloadList.innerHTMLltbrgt                  fori  0 i lt arr.length i                                      tempID  arr[i].comicID                     getCoverJSONarr, i, tempID                                    document.getElementByIduploadTagID.innerHTML                 document.getElementByIduploadTagID.innerHTMLltugtUploaded Comicsltugt                 document.getElementByIdbtnDeleteComic.disabledfalse                 document.getElementByIdbtnEditComic.disabledfalse                 document.getElementByIdbtnDelAllComics.disabledfalse                 listButtons.show                              ltscriptgt      ltscriptgt           Function to prevent .get from technically being inside a loop fixes an issue when loading more than one item.         function getCoverJSONarr, i, tempID                         .getgetCover.php, comicID tempID, functionresult                              getCoverresult, arr, i                                                                    ltscriptgt      ltscriptgt           Function to create a list of radio buttons and associated images from a users comic list.         function getCoverresult, arr, i                      var buildLine  document.getElementByIdloadList.innerHTML             if result[0].pageLocation  nocvr                              var out  lthrgtltbrgtltinput namecomicList typeradio id  arr[i].comicID   value  arr[i].comicID  gt  arr[i].comicName   ltoptiongtltbrgtltbrgtltimg name    cm  arr[i].comicID   id  com  arr[i].comicID   onclickresizeThumbthis height100px srcassetsimgnocvr.jpggtltbrgtltbrgt                  document.getElementByIdloadList.innerHTML                 document.getElementByIdloadList.innerHTMLbuildLine  out                          else                              var getImg  result[0].pageLocation                 var out  lthrgtltbrgtltinput namecomicList typeradio id  arr[i].comicID   value  arr[i].comicID  gt  arr[i].comicName   ltoptiongtltbrgtltbrgtltimg name    cm  arr[i].comicID   id  com  arr[i].comicID   onclickresizeThumbthis height100px src  getImg  gtltbrgtltbrgt                  document.getElementByIdloadList.innerHTML                 document.getElementByIdloadList.innerHTMLbuildLine  out                             ltscriptgt codepre  hr  pPHP loadCom.phpp  precodeltphp headerAccessControlAllowOrigin  headerContentType applicationjson charsetUTF8  user  GET[userID] includeonceincludesconn.inc.php   query  SELECT comicID, comicName  FROM comic WHERE userID  user ORDER BY comicName ASC result  mysqliqueryconn, query  outp  [ whilers  resultgtfetcharrayMYSQLIASSOC      if outp  [              outp . ,          outp . comicID . rs[comicID] . ,     outp . comicName . rs[comicName] .    outp .]  conngtclose echo outp  gt codepre  hr  pPHP getCover.phpp  precodeltphp headerAccessControlAllowOrigin  headerContentType applicationjson charsetUTF8 if issetGET[comicID]      includeonceincludesconn.inc.php     checkID  GET[comicID]      query  SELECT pageLocation FROM page WHERE comicID  checkID ORDER BY pageNum     result  mysqliqueryconn, query      if mysqlinumrowsresult  0              outp  [pageLocationnocvr]          echo outp          else              outp  [         whilers  resultgtfetcharrayMYSQLIASSOC                      if outp  [                              outp . ,                          outp . pageLocation . rs[pageLocation] .                   outp .]          conngtclose         echo outp        else         checkID  null     echo Error.

Negative 10701 pI am really struggling at implementing threads into my application. This might get kind of long so please bear with me.  My questions are more around the suggested structure of my application than it is around the code to add threading.p  pFirst let me show a visual of my application.  Than explain a few things.  The application is fed data via an Arduino on the serial port.  In a nut shell I open a serial port, read the data line by line, process it and show it visually on the screen.  The visuals are two parts. The first is the time for each racer that is kept and passed via the serial port by the Arduino.  The second it the race progress based on the distance of the race that is represented in the clock style hands you see also see in the screen shot.  This all happens real time and the data coming from the Arduino via the serial port happens very fast. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUAnZc.gif altenter image description herep  pOnce the race is started this function is how I parse the data and tell the system what to do with the data.p  precodedef letsraceself     def getsome         global var1, var2, totalCount         self.reset          self.senddemo         letsRace  1         ser.writegn         while letsRace  1             print mycount             s  ser.readline             s  s.striprn             Check for                        pattern  r[]             if re.searchpattern, s                 print VALID  r  s,                 var1, var2  s.split                 self.options[var1]             else                 print INVALID  r  s,                 pass             if totalCount  4                 letsRace  0         self.racecomplete     thread  threading.Threadtargetgetsome     thread.start   codepre  pAs you can see I do have a thread going.  This worked great since displaying the timer for each racer was bogging down the application.  I have had no problem once I added the threading on the race function.p  pI should also point out that I use a dictionary as a case statement.  It is up in the ini of a Race class. It looks like this below. p  precode    self.options  0 self.drawr1,         1 self.drawr2,         2 self.drawr3,         3 self.drawr4,         0f self.racerFinish,         1f self.racerFinish,         2f self.racerFinish,         3f self.racerFinish,         x self.emptyLine,         t self.raceTime,         G self.letsGo,         CD self.countDown,         C self.emptyLine,          codepre  pBased on what I parse from the realtime data stream I process it with the correct function. Pretty basic stuff so far I think you will agree.  p  pI just completed the code to add in the racer dials on top of the clockstyle display. I am using Pillow PIL to rotate the dials.  This is also pretty basic stuff. I have a canvas and I added four images to the canvas to represent each racer.   I use a different function for each racer to update their position in the race.  They are the first four functions you see in the dictionary above. Here is an example of one of them.  They are all pretty much the same other than what image they are updating on the clock.     p  precode    def drawr4self     if self.r4isdone  0         self.angle  floatvar2  self.movement   1          if self.angle lt 360            self.angle  0         self.canvas.deleteself.canvasobj4         self.newarrow4  ImageTk.PhotoImageself.imager4.rotateself.angle         self.canvasobj4  self.canvas.createimage215, 215, imageself.newarrow4 codepre  pIf you are familiar with PIL and rotating an image you  know that it basically redraws the graphic over and over to show the new positions. Here is where the system now has issues.  On a Win8 or Mac the dials dont really impact the performance of the application.   On a Raspberry PI with limited processing power it does. A demo race takes about 6.4 seconds to complete but on a RPi it take about 15 seconds due to the processing of the image redraws. To get this working on something like the Raspberry Id like to have each dial animation running in its own thread.p  pSo, if you are still reading this great.  I apologize for the length. Now my question.  How would you suggest I get each dial movement into its own thread  Keep in mind that the main racing function above has a thread.  Every threading example I have read is so basic that implementing anything in a full gui application has my head spinning a bit. p

Negative 10701 pIm currently making a program in Java using the Ecipse IDE.

Thus all of the Main programs code, and I really dont want to be doing that. The idea is that the plugin isnt standalone, and should only contain its own code.p  pSo is there a way to select which dependencies to export with the jar file Or am I better off exporting it as a nonrunnable jar file, and then adding the class file dependencies manuallyp  pCheersp  pstrongtldrstrong How do I export a jar file from eclipse with only the dependencies I choose, not all of them.p

Negative 10701 pI would like to perform a block wise FFT on an image in Matlab where the FFT is calculated for every pixel in the image and a KxK environment of that pixel. If the input image size is MxN, the output image size would be KMxKN where each pixel is now represented by a KxK block that is the FFT of said environment.p  pI am currently doing this using the built in Matlab function blockproc, but it turns out to run very slowly for an image of size 576x768 pixels. I could do it with old fashioned for loops to gain some efficiency but it seems too similar to the operation of convolution on an image but without the summation. Meaning, if I take my filter to be a tweedle matrix corresponding to the FFT, I put it centered on a specific pixel and multiply element by element I would get a KxK matrix corresponding to that specific pixel, which is exactly what conv does but without the summation. Since Matlab has very efficient implementations of the convolution operation, I was wondering if it is possible to do this using builtin Matlab functions that may involve convolution or something similar.p

Negative 10701 pIm trying to build a macro to prevent the Workbook being saved if several mandatory entries arent completed.p  pFor example in cell D14 the user should input yes or no  and theres a dropdown list to facilitate this. If the cell isnt filled in, the workbook cant be saved. Ive achieved this with the followingp  precodePrivate Sub WorkbookBeforeSaveByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean If IsEmptyThisWorkbook.Sheets1.RangeD14 Then Cancel  True MsgBox SAVE CANCELLED. Please ensure all mandatory entries are completed. End If End Sub codepre  pThis is working fine.p  pThe only issue is I want the file to open with D14 blank. One way around this is that D3 has to be filled in also, with a date. Is it possible to include something like if D3 is not empty, then D14 contains yes or no or it cant be saved.p  pOr any other ideas as to how to open the file with the mandatory entries blank, but not save unless they are completedp  pThe mandatory entries are not limited to D14  they include various cells in column D. But I can edit code to allow for that.p  pThanksp

Negative 10701 pLets say you start with a UIImage and you wish to crop it. The most common method is to use CGImageCreateWithImageInRect to get a CGImageRef and create a new image from it like sop  precodeCGRect cropRect  CGRectMakexwidth, yheight, width, height CGImageRef imageRef  CGImageCreateWithImageInRect[image CGImage], cropRect UIImage croppedImage  [UIImage imageWithCGImageimageRef] codepre  pNow lets say you later need to convert this UIImage into an NSData object. For example, this will happen if you wish to store the image on disk using NSKeyedArchiver. Or you can get an NSData object out by doing the following explicitlyp  precodeNSData imageData  UIImagePNGRepresentationcroppedImage codepre  pI did this and later on I tried to reconstruct a new UIImage object by doingp  precodeUIImage image  [UIImage imageWithDataimageData] codepre  pI did this for a series of 48 images. Most of them were fine, but after every 4 images the next 2 were corrupted with the top and bottom of each image swapped. If I take out the conversion to NSData and back again, it works fine. I also get the exact same problem if I use NSKeyedArchiver to write an array of the images out to disk which Im guessing calls something like UIImagePNGRepresentation in its encoding routine. My theory is this must have something to do with how I build the images from CGImageRefs. p  pWhat is the workaround for this I cant seem to figure out how to put CGImageRefs into NSData object and Id prefer a solution that builds the UIImage correctly so that it may be serialized.p  pEditp  pSome people asked for the actual code being run, so Im adding it herep  precode    UIImage image  self.animationObject.image for int y0 ylt[self.animationInfoObject.numInY intValue] y      for int x0 xlt[self.animationInfoObject.numInX intValue] x          CGRect cropRect  CGRectMakexwidth, yheight, width, height         CGImageRef imageRef  CGImageCreateWithImageInRect[image CGImage], cropRect         UIImage croppedImage  [UIImage imageWithCGImageimageRef]         NSData imageData  UIImageJPEGRepresentationcroppedImage, 1.0         [self addImageToArrayimageData]         CFReleaseimageRef       codepre  pThe image from self.animationObject.image is a grid of images with numInX and and numInY images in each direction. I crop each individual image out of the 2D grid and save them. p  pLater on, I put the images in a image view to animate them. Here is the codep  precode        NSMutableArray animationArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]     for int frame0 framelt[[photoObject frameArray] count] frame          NSData imageData [[photoObject imageArray] objectAtIndex[[[photoObject frameArray] objectAtIndexframe] integerValue]1]         UIImage image  [UIImage imageWithDataimageData]         [animationArray addObjectimage]      codepre  pThis all works fine on an iPhone 6 but does not work on an iPhone 5. It also seems to only be a problem when the grid of images is long. For example, for the example Im using self.animationObject.image has numInY as 3 and numInX 2 and the total size of the image is 1536x3072 each miniimage is 768x1024. It is the bottom two images that have their tops and bottoms flipped.p

Negative 10701 pWhat Ive read about the two above patterns is pretty different from what Ive seen in enterprise applications.p  pFor what Ive understood about them, you use a DAO for basic CRUD operations such as codecreateDomainEntity decode, coderetrieveID idcode, codeupdateDomainEntity decode, codedeleteDomainEntity decode andor codedeleteID idcode . The DAO class has no reference at all to a Repository. Repository, on the other hand, manage other operations like codefindAllcode, codecountcode, codefindBySomeCriteriaCriteria criteriacode, ... That is, it handles Aggregate Root. a hrefhttpthinkinginobjects.com20120826dontusedaouserepository relnofollowThisa site contains a good example of the use of the two patterns.p  pIn many projects using SpringData, however, Ive seen something different. For example, for every entity, you havep  ul lia generic interface codeEntityRepositorycode that extends codepublic interface RepositoryltT,ID extends Serializablegtcode or one of its subinterfaces. It contains methods signature with some conventional names basing on these names, SpringData automatically execute the right query on the database.li lia generic codeinterface EntityDaocode with basic CRUD operations the same operations seen aboveli lipa class that implements codeEntityDaocode. This is the most controversial point, because this class contains a reference to the repository class. Something likep  precodeService public class EntityDaoImpl extends GenericDaoImplltEntitygt implements EntityDao     Autowired   private EntityRepository repository    public void deleteID id    repository.deleteID id        other CRUD operations using repository      codepreli ul  pIn this way, there is a high coupling between the DAO and the Repository.p  pSo, is this the normal usage of the Repository in SpringData Does SpringData implement the Repository pattern in a different way from its theoretic wayp

Negative 10701 pIm developing a custom keyboard extension and noticed when I call codeself.inputView.frame.size.widthcode in either codeviewDidLoadcode or codeviewWillAppearcode, it returns 0 or an incorrect number. Only in codeviewDidAppearcode is it correct. This is a problem because I need to update the size of elements in the keyboard based on the available width and height. Right now I am handling this by detecting the frame size in codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode, which is called several times before it is correct. This works, but the user can see the elements changing size in the keyboard  the frame is not correct until after it has been presented to the user. This is also a problem because I need to update the scroll position once the elements are their correct size, so Im forced to delay that until codeviewDidAppearcode. This isnt a great user experience with things jumping around after its been presented.p  pIs there any way I could know the height and width of the keyboard earlier in the life cycle so I can set the size of the elements before they become visible to the userp  pI am using a XIB to create the keyboard interface which utilizes Auto Layout.

Negative 10701 pI have a Django web server that accepts requests from clients. In addition, I have another server, written with a hrefhttpstwistedmatrix.com relnofollowTwisteda. I wrote a Twisted protocol  its server half is running on the server, and I have a very easy to use client protocol as well.p  pOccasionally the Django server receives requests that need to initiate a request to the Twisted server. This may obviously be a long operation, so it cannot be synchronous. Im having trouble incorporating a Twisted client inside the Django project to make these requests.p  pSimplifying the architecture a bit, it looks something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comonVHq.png altenter image description herep  pInitially, I created a global thread instance in the views.py file of my Django project that runs Twisteds reactor loop, and whenever a request was received through the Django server, Id add it to the reactor asynchronously to be performed by that thread. This worked fine with the codepython manage.py runservercode script, however when I ran it on my Apache server I would sometimes get the requests on the Twisted server and sometimes wouldnt.p  pIm assuming this is because Apache also runs several threads, each of which tries to create that reactorthread. Since there may only be one reactor per process, only one thread succeeds while the others fail, therefore only some requests make it through  the ones in the winning thread this is just a theory, I havent verified it.p  pI believe my options arep  ol liSomehow share my reactorthread instance among all Apache threads so that theres really just one reactor. Not sure exactly how to do this  everything I find online talks about sharing strongdatastrong through Djangos DB, not sharing instances.li liRun the Twisted client as a separate process on the Django server machine, and send requests from Django with some RPC method that is not Twistedbased  otherwise Id be back in square one of running a Twisted client inside Django, which I cannot seem to be able to do....li ol  pAny advice on what is the correct solution  how to implement it Is there another way Im not thinking ofp  pThank you.p

Negative 10701 pIn a MySQL database where there are relationships between tables and the primary key of one table is stored as a foreign key in a second table, is there still a need to perform a joinp  pIf there is, what is the point on declaring the relationship Id take a stab in the dark and say its something to do with the indexing or related tables can find related records much faster Ive tried Googleing this, but cant seem to find much.

Negative 10701 pSay Im writing an adventure game.  The map is built of tiles of different types.  I have tiles that form paths, and tiles that form doors, and so on. p  pI will use a struct to describe the type and content of a tile, and to which other tiles it connects.p  pThen Ill make a quadruplelinked list to connect them all together.  p  pBut a struct that will describe a room will have far more elements than one that will describe a door, so many elements in a door struct will be redundant.  I could make a smaller door struct, but structs can only point to structs of the same type, so I couldnt connect a room struct to a door struct.  The redundancy may be negligible but I wondered if theres another way.p  pAnother option is using an array of structs, but then Id have lots of padding structs wasting even more space.  However an array would make reading and rebuilding a map from file much easier.p  pIs there any way around the limitation that a struct can only point to a struct of the same type  Or is there another common solution to this problem that I havent mentionedp  pOne idea I had was that each tile could have pointers for every other type of tile.  Some would be redundant, but it would be a lesser redundancy that the option above.p  pBy this I mean that typically in a linked list, structs contain pointers to struct of the same type that theyre in.p

Negative 10701 pI have codeListViewcode that is populated like sop  precodeArrayListltMyFullDataClassgt myFullDataClassList  Utilities.getDataFromSQLitegetActivity  populate list from SQLite ArrayAdapterltMyFullDataClassgt adapter  new ArrayAdapterltMyFullDataClassgtgetActivity, android.R.layout.simplelistitem1, MyFullDataClassList setListAdapteradapter codepre  pMyFullDataClass contains many things Name, address, phone, email, web site, etc. So as it is, each row of the list contains all of this information. Its a little busy. I would like to make it so that each row in the list contains only, say, name and email and then touching the row would popup with all information in MyFullDataClassp  pI could do this by creating a class, call it MyPartialDataClass, that contains fields for only name and email, then create an codeArrayListltMyPartialDataClassgtcode and copy data from myFullDataClassList to myPartialDataClassList and use this partial class for the adapter. Then when a row is clicked, use myFullDataClassList.  p  pNot particularly elegant, but it would work.p  pIs there a better wayp
Negative 10701 pFor a program that I am working on, I am getting data from mysql and writing to a csv file.  Then I am going to take the data from the csv and put it into a 2d vector in C.p  pIt is likely that my csv file will be on the scale of anywhere between 1 and 1.5 million rows, and 8 columns.  Now the csv can be thought of as a bunch of chunks sorted by an ID number.  That is, for example, maybe the first 100 rows belong to ID number 1, the next 80 rows belong to ID number 2, and so on.  The reason I put them all in one csv is because requesting data from mysql is slow and I only want to make one request.p  pMy question is, would it be better in my C program to create one large vector 1.5 million x 8  containing the entire csv file at once, or do a loop where I am creating a 100 x 8 vector, then an 80 x 8 vector, and so on  I am sorry if I have not formulated this question well. If you have any other questions to help clarify I would be glad to answer.p
Negative 10701 pWhen running my test c app against my dynamic library which links against NVIDIAs libGL.so I am getting the following errors see below reported by Valgrind.

Negative 10701 pWhen my app starts I dinamically add a fragment instance say, codefragment1code to the content layout in a transaction which is not added to the back stack. This fragment displays some cached data which has been passed to it by means of a codenewInstanceListltObjgtcode static method. In codeonSaveInstanceStatecode I save the data so I can display it if the fragment is recreated.p  pNow suppose I dont recreate the fragment. Suppose I replace it with a second fragment, say, codefragment2code adding the transaction to the back stack this time, perform two screen rotations, and press back. The app will pop the back stack and attempt to display codefragment1code again which by its turn will attempt to display codeListltObjgtcode which will be codenullcode so a codeNullPointerExceptioncode will be thrown.p  pI understand this is because the codefragment1code instance has never been saved in the first place, since it wasnt in the back stack and neither was on display when the device rotated.p  pMy question is, whats the most appropriate way of supporting screen rotations in this case I could save the initial transaction in the back stack and make codeonBackPressedcode verify that codegetSupportFragmentManager.getBackStackEntryCount gt 1code before popping the back stack I dont want the initial transaction to be popped because codefragment1code is my initial screen but I dont think this is the correct approach. Any ideasp
Negative 10701 pIm new to RoR and Im a little bit confused with Rails MWC. I feel like I misunderstand something. p  pFor example, I want to have home page where I could render top 5 articles and top 5 products. Products and articles have no relations at all, it is totally separate data.p  pSo what I try to do is, i crate 2 sacffolds products and articles, and 1 controller for home page. I root to homepage controller. Then in homepage template i try to render products and article template. I get an error that methods which are used in products and articles controllers are undefined.p  pI dont understand where is problem. Is this kind of template rendering one template inside another is not Rails convention. Or I have bugs in my code.p
Negative 10701 pI am creating an app that uses a navigation drawer in its main activity. in the drawer the user can navigate through 8 different fragments. I am currently using p  precodefragmentTransaction.replaceR.id.container,MyFragment codepre  pto navigate through the fragments but it is not the best for the user experience because it reloads the fragments each time and the navigation drawer sliding is not fluid. I tried using p  precodefragmentTransaction.addR.id.container,MyFragment codepre  pand then hiding all others fragment but it becomes confusing and it does not work very well especially when a fragment is called from another fragment. is there a way to make the navigation more fluid without the need to reload the fragment each time it is selectedp
Negative 10701 pScenario  Let us say, I finished a puzzle game in x amount of time. I want to challenge one of my friend to beat that time. Let us say there is a way to send a requestsms, email, Fb link with game parameters, when my friend clicks on the request game starts with specified settings. Then my friend can notify me if he beat me.p  pCan this be designed without any serverservice component and just by using available communication methods.p
Negative 10701 pI have a set of anchor element that call the same django view but should set a different tab active in the codecoursedetailcode view in my application like thisp  precode lta href url coursescoursedetail course.id gtGo to Examsltagt  lta href url coursescoursedetail course.id gtGo to Lecturesltagt  lta href url coursescoursedetail course.id gtGo to Homeworkltagt  lta href url coursescoursedetail course.id gtGo to Resultsltagt codepre  pIn the coursedetail view, an angular controller handles which tab is active, when clicked. However, I want to be able to append the fragment something when user clicks the anchor elements abovep  pFor example when user clicks Go to Results the url should be codecourse1detailresultscodep  pI know that djangoserver side does not know about the codesomethingcode, so how do I handle it in javascript or angularp  pI thought I could send an http get request from an angular controller when an anchor element is clicked but how do I get what the django view URL is If I figure that out, can I append the fragment in the http get requestp

SQLExpress database file autocreation error  The connection string specifies a local Sql Server Express instance using a database location within the applications AppData directory. The provider attempted to automatically create the application services database because the provider determined that the database does not exist. The following  configuration requirements are necessary to successfully check for existence of the application services database and automatically create the  application services database  If the application is running on either Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008R2,  special configuration steps are necessary to enable automatic creation of  the provider database. Additional information is available at  httpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId160102. If the applications AppData  directory does not already exist, the web server account must have read and write access to the applications directory. This is necessary because the web server account will automatically create the AppData directory if it does not already exist. If the applications AppData directory already exists, the web server account only requires read and write access to the applications AppData directory. This is necessary because the web server account will attempt to verify that the Sql Server Express database already exists within the applications AppData directory. Revoking read access on the AppData directory from the web server account will prevent the provider from correctly determining if the Sql Server Express database already exists. This will cause an error when the provider attempts to create a duplicate of an already existing database. Write access is required because the web server accounts credentials are used when creating the new database. Sql Server Express must be installed on the machine. The process identity for the web server account must have a local user profile.

Negative 10701 pI understand that Mobicents PS is not supported now but I want to understand about the scalability of MSPS.p  pI understand from the source code that MSPS uses JBoss Cache instead of the database to store presence information. I understand the concept of cache but no idea of JBoss cache.p  pIt seems that the storage is limited by the amount of memory available in the machine and whenever a new nodephysical machine is to be added the cache has to be replicated into that machine.p  pIs this correct behavior or my understanding is totally wrong.p
Negative 10701 pThe shape and positions of all the polygons are known beforehand. The polygons are not overlapping and will be of different colors and shapes, and there could be quite many of them. The polygons are defined in floating point based coordinates and will be painted on top of a JPEG photo as annotation.p  pHow could I create the resulting image file as fast as possible after I get to know which color I should give each polygonp  pIf it would save time I would like to perform as much as possible of the computations beforehand. All information regarding geometry and positions of the polygons are known in advance. The JPEG photo is also known in advance. The only information not known beforehand is the color of each polygon.p  pThe JPEG photo has a size of 250x250 pixels, so that would also be the image size of the resulting rasterised image.p  pThe computations will be done on a Linux computer with a standard graphics card, so OpenGL might be a viable option. I know there are also rasterisation libraries like a hrefhttpcairographics.org relnofollowCairoa that could be used to paint polygons. What I wonder is if I could take advantage of the fact that I know so much of the input in advance and use that to speed up the computation. The only thing missing is the color of each polygon.p  pPreferably I would like to find a solution that would only precompute things in the form of data files. In other words as soon as the polygon colors are known, the algorithm would load the other information from datafiles JPEG file, polygon geometry file andor possibly precomputed datafiles. Of course it would be faster to start the computation out with a warm state ready in the GPUCPURAM but Id like to avoid that. The choice of programming language is not so import, but could for instance be C.p  pTo give some more background information The JavaScript library a hrefhttpopenseadragon.github.io relnofollowOpenSeadragona that is running in a web browser requests image tiles from a web server. The idea is that measurement points i.e. the polygons could be plotted onthefly on to pregenerated Zooming Images DZI format by the web server. So for one image tile the algorithm would only need to be run one time. The aim is low latency.p

Negative 10701 pIs it possible to know the type generic or specific of SNMP trap by looking at the OID I have read that trap id 05 are generic and 6 is for enterprise specific. e.g. 0 means coldstart, 1 means warmstart. However, some online a hrefhttpwww.netsnmp.orgdocsmibssnmpMIB.html relnofollowmateriala points out 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1 is for coldstart. From OID, I dont see a zero originally I thought the last sub identifier would be 0 to match the coldstart trap id. I am now confusing. Is a trap id totally different concept than OID Or do they have some connection  p

Negative 10701 pI am experiencing some build issues for an Android project. We had to start using multidex support given that we have over the 65K limit for methods. One thing Im having issues with though is creating the main dex list file. I can build everything but after I drop down the apk onto my device the app crashes and I get unorthodx errors like NoClassDefFoundError or VerifyError. So, I think it has something to do with multidex, Im pretty stuck. Should I just add all class files to the list Thanks.p
Negative 10701 pIve got the following questionp  pI have a SQL dataset with 3 tables, 1 with country names and details 1 with port name and details and 1 with timezone name and details.p  pThese table are constraint to eachother using the country.ID value, i.e. table portname has a FK column from country.ID and table timezone likewise.p  pIn order to link them together in a winform application I have created a simple form with 3 comboboxes.p  pOn the form Ive createdp  ul lidatasetli libindingsource to country tableli libindingsource to FKcountrytabletoportnameli libindingsource to FKcountrytabletotimezoneli liptable adapter for each of the tablesp  pThe trick is or at least that was the intention that the filling of the 2 secondary comboboxes will be dependent on the selection in the country combobox. I.e. after selection of the first combobox, the second portname and third timezones should be filtered based on the selected parent ID country.IDpli ul  pThis works fine for a single combobox, i.e. if I select a country, the ports get filtered yet if I apply same principle to 2 comboboxes at the same time the third one stays emptyp  pNow Im pretty sure it has something to do with the restraints on the FK which are enforced on the dataset.p  pIve tried loading tableAdapters in different sequence need to load country table first Ive tried swapping data in comboboxes i.e. display timezone info in portname combo, which works if I GetData timezone first, but then Portname stays blank and v.v.p  pWhatever Ive tried, there is always one of the two secondary combos emptyp  pIts not about setting the combobox, as I can get that done by writing an event for cmbCountrySelectedIndexChanged like below, which works fine.p  precodeDim tmpTZtable As DataTable  Me.WorldtimezonesTableAdapter.GetDataByCountryIDMe.cmbCountry.SelectedValue         With Me.cmbEtaTimeZone             .DataSource  tmpTZtable             .DisplayMember  txtTimeZoneId             .ValueMember  DST offset 1 Jul 2015             .Update             If tmpTZtable.Rows.Count  1 Then                 .Enabled  False             Else                 .Enabled  True             End If         End With codepre  pI would just like to get a better understanding why the binding to the cboCountry on FK country.ID method doesnt work p  pPlease see below some pics for clarificationp  pComboboxes img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtfBEy.jpg altcombobox Country img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv6Kew.jpg altcombobox Portname img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMUCg4.jpg altcombobox TimeZonep  pBindingsources cboCountryp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8oWx5.jpg altcboCountry cboPortnamep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlgba7.jpg altcboPortname cboTimeZonep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlqeUG.jpg altcboTimeZonep  pdataSet relations img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKrrjK.jpg altenter image description herep
