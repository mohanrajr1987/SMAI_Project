Positive 174 pI have a question concerning the design of a class in one of the projects I have been working on. To be more precise I will explain the scenario and would require feedback on the same if its the correct approach or not. p  pWe have a validation class to validate business data input by user before persisting it, say for example I have a validation method to check if the user name starts with a blank, another method to validate that for a particular type of user the address should be provided, like this we have several validation methods and we will have more such validations as the project grows. These validation methods are declared as private with a public interface method in the service class which only calls all these private methods when user clicks on save. Now the problem here is when writing junits for suppose nth validation method I have to traverse through all the previous validations preparing test data accordingly as there is a common public interface for them. Also if there is a change in logic of any other validation it is likely that my junits will fail. I suggested my colleagues to have package or protected visibility if not public for these methods but they say just for unit testing changing the visibility is not correct. p  pAlso I have found another solution using reflection to access private members but it seems to be more of a hack and is not recommended as per some of the answers given in stack overflow. So now I am begining to think if this is a design smell as its possible in future that we might require some of these validations in other parts of the project and then will have to make it public anyways. But I am not sure about it so before suggesting this change I thought it would be good to go for some experts advice on the same.p  pCould you please tell if this is a design issue and we should have had these methods as public and this is not a design issue then how should this be handled best p

Positive 174 pI came across this design, So I am not quite sure which way to lean towards. Any help would be much appreciatedp  precodeI have three levels a Dialog b Controller c View codepre  pThe Dialog creates the Controller and the view object. The Dialog passes down the view to the controller on the constructors argument.p  pSome of this design is existing, so the code base is already messed up, but  regardless, this is my questionp  pSay if I have a Listener interface.p  precodeInterface DoSomthing int doSomthing  codepre  pThe existing flow is like below Dialog implements the listener and adds it to the controller. The controller implements the listener,again no implementation change from the dialog and adds it to the view. The view notifies the controller and then the controller notifies the Dialog and the dialog performs the action as needed.p  pSo the Dialog creates the controller and implements the above interface and adds it to the controller.p  pShould the controller implement the same interface again or should it be a different interface.p  pAs of now the implementation detail are the same, but I think since we look this as a layer.p  precodeShould I have it like this a View Listener b Controller Listener codepre  pAnd make the Dialog implement the Controller listener and the Controller implement the view listener.p  pLike thisp  precodeInterface DoSomthingContollerListener int doSomthingController   Interface DoSomthingViewListener int doSomthingView  codepre  pOr just have a generic listener in both the view and controller and implement them differently.p  pThe problem I had having them as a generic listener is,I think since we use an MVCthough the above does not follow MVC at all type design the interface should be for each level.p  pAm I wrongp
Positive 174 pI need to print regular report and a batch report. I am using podofo library.

Positive 174 pI am developing a text editor somewhat similar to Emacs in Jython, although the language is not important in this case. p  pI have an independent strongdata modelstrong, a few strongviewsstrong for the menu, the text area and a console where I display log messages and will receive commands from the user, and a strongcontrollerstrong for each view. Moreover, I have a strongmain controllerstrong, which is the entry point of the application and puts together all the views and creates the view controllers.p  pWhen a user interacts with a view, the view calls its controller and the controller decides what needs to be done. If a user selects in the menu an option to show an about pop up, the menu controller will handle that itself. However, when there is an option in the menu that involves changes in another view, e.g. when a user chooses to close a file, then the text area needs to be cleared. In this case, the menu controller delegates the action to the main controller, which in turn figures out the text area controller needs to tell its view to clear up the text. Something likep  precode1. User clicks close file in menu view 2. Menu view tells menu controller user selected close file 3. Menu controller delegates this actions to the Main controller since it has no access to the text area view. 4. Main controller tells text area controller to clear up text area 5. Text area controller clears up its views text area. codepre  pI find that most user actions cant be handled by the immediate controller of the view the user is interacting with, and need to be passed to the main controller, leaving the main controller being a huge class, whilst the other controllers are just delegating actions. p  pThis looks like its not the best way to go. Am I missing something Is there a better way to do this Should I forget about the intermediate controllers and rethink the main controllerp  pAny insights on this would be greatly appreciated.p
Positive 174 pLets say I have a class Child that inherits from class Parent. Both classes need to be able to be able to send a function pointer of the same method, lets call it foo, to an API. p  pI dont think I can make foo a member function, since the process invoking the callback would need to have an object of either Child or Parent to call it with. I also dont think I can make foo a static member function since there may be multiple instances of Parent of Child. p  pWhat would be the cleanest place to put foo in this case Should it go into its own file and have its own namespace, and get included into both Parent and Child Should foo be in Parent only meaning Child would need to include Parent.cpp and forward declare foo p  pAppreciate any insightp

Positive 174 h2What I want to doh2  pI want to include logging in my tests preferably using System.Diagnostics such that each test case writes to its own log file lets say the format is testcasename.log. strongThe catchstrong is that the logging statements will not be in the test methods themselves, but in a separate class hierarchy, which the different test methods will share. An examplep  pTest classesp  ol liBaseTestClass abstractli liDerivedTestClassFirefox BaseTestClass has test methods like TestAFirefox,TestBFirefoxli liDerivedTestClassChrome BaseTestClass has test methods like TestAChrome, TestBChromeli ol  pOperationClass includes basic actions done by tests and has the logging statements Lets say it has methods OperationA, OperationB, etc. Now different test methods can share these operations. So if OperationA has codeLogger.LogInfoDoing operation Acode, then this message should go to the correct log file according to what test called it. The tests need to be able to run in parallel. I will be using MSTest if it matters.p  h2My current solutionh2  pI made a static Logger class like below   p  precode    public static class Logger              stores tracesource objects against tracesource names same as test method name         entries are added in this by the [TestInitialize] method in BaseTest, as it has access to the calling test method name from TestContext         private static Dictionaryltstring, TraceSourcegt TraceSourceMap  new Dictionaryltstring, TraceSourcegt         automatically determines which log file the message should go to         from the stack trace and test method naming conventions         private static string GetCallingTestName                      StackTrace stackTrace  new StackTrace              StackFrame[] stackFrames  stackTrace.GetFrames              foreach StackFrame stackFrame in stackFrames                              if stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithfirefox                      stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithchrome                      stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithie                                      return stackFrame.GetMethod.Name                                           return null                   private static TraceSource GetTraceSourceObject                      string traceSourceName  GetCallingTestName             TraceSource ts  TraceSourceMap[traceSourceName]             return ts                  public static void LogInfostring logMessage                                            TraceSource ts  GetTraceSourceObject             ts.TraceInformationString.Format[0] 1n, DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay, logMessage               codepre  pThe [TestInitialize] method in BaseTestClass sets up TraceSource with the name as the calling test method name, adds the listener a log file with same name as test name and then adds this object in Logger classs dictionary.p  pThe strongissuestrong is that this design completely depends on test naming. The tests must have firefox, chrome, etc. in the end, and none of the other methods can end like this, because then itll be impossible to tell through stack trace what is a test method or what is an operation unless I impose further pattern in test method naming. On the other hand, this is very less code and will work perfectly even if I run tests in parallel.p  h2Problem Questionh2  pI want to know in what other way I can achieve the same result and if this design is actually that bad. One idea might be to create a logger object in [TestInitialize] of BaseTestClass recall that before this I dont know what the logging file will be as it depends on test name, so cant do this at constructor time and then somehow pass this logger to OperationClass. But then there is only one instance of logger object for the whole test class and this would be a problem if I want to run tests in parallel right As each test method logs in a different place, so each test method needs its own version of logger object. Even for parallely running tests I guess the test class is instantiated only oncep

Positive 174 pI have a enterprise application where there are multiple sub applications doing different tasks. These sub applications will interact with each other with Web Services to share functionalities among each other and complete a task for a user either themselves exclusively or combination from two application functionalities.p  pThere is a common set of large number of assets items present in a sub application say Asset Store on which these sub applications work which is also exposed to all these sub applications through its Web Services. This Asset store may be an external system or not deployed in same environment or may be outside cloud in which other sub apps are present. So, performance might be a hit outside the network.p  pNo, considering a user of Sub App  1 who want to perform a task on a selected set of these assets, will login to Sub App 1, go to a screen which will show him all the assets available. He selects those assets and add in his kitty to perform some actions on them, process these assets and then complete the task for him. Similarly, different sub applications will access this common Asset store to process them in different manner based on the sub application user is logged into.p  pWhile processing these assets in Sub App 1, we can do it in three waysp  ol lipWe make LIVE Web Services calls to Asset Store sub application to return us set of these products based on user search or criteria. In this case we are not storing anything in Sub App 1 database till now. Once the user selects an asset, process it in Sub App 1, we just store an ID of that processed asset in Sub App 1 database.pli lipWe follow the same steps as of 1 but instead of always making Live Web Services call to Asset store, we first check in local cache at application server of Sub App 1 in case it is present there, return the asset else make a live call to Asset store to fetch the asset. Rest same processing follows and we just store the Asset ID in sub app 1 database for that processed asset.pli lipI duplicate all the assets data of Asset Store in database of Sub App 1, create sync jobs to nightly sync contents between external Asset Sore and Sub App 1. Now, instead of making a Live call to external Asset store, I choose my sub app 1 database to return me the results from local db which will be quite fast in response. Process the asset and save the relational IDs of asset in the sub app 1 database which can be used to pull all other info. associated to that asset from the local DB only of sub app 1. However, since I said though I have gained the performance by duplicating the asset database locally. However, since all my Sub applications in this application uses this common asset store for one kind of processing or other, I will have to duplicate this data and write night jobs to sync data between all these applications and my common asset store.pli ol  pMy question is, which of these approaches are best suited for the current context of the application and why The number of assets in the asset store are around 3035000p  pAny help in defining the reasons is highly appreciated. Thanks a lot.p

Positive 174 pI have an application in which I want to have strict separation between backend and frontendGUI.p  pThe backend is the application logic with cpp classes and the frontend are QML files with some cpp classes which mainly works as adapters to the backend.p  pNow I was wondering if it is okay to have classes derived from QAbstractModel in the backend form a design point of view.p  pMy first thought was that they should NOT belong to the backend because they are just a wrapper around some Qt Container classes to reflect their data in the GUI. So a pointer to the actual data can be injected and they should only be used in the frontend for displaying purpose but they should not be used anywhere in the backend.p  pThe Qt Container classes of course should belong to the backend.p  pNow I also need some conversion and utilities functions which act and maybe modifies the data of the containers. Therefore I wrote a handler class. But now it is starting to get tricky to keep everything in sync especially without getting bindingloops.p  pThe other solution would be to have a class derived from QAbstractModel which wraps the data and also have these conversion and utilities functions. They could then call the dataChanged etc. functions. Then I could use this class also in the backend. But would that be good design or should the backend be free of QAbstractModel derived classesp  pSince I find it quite difficult to express my issue clearly, I hope my question is understandable in some way p

Positive 174 pI was reading an article that was linked from the CodeProjects blog that lambasted the overuse of design patterns by newer programmers when writing code.

Positive 174 pLogEvent represents information like log level, message, user, process name, ... Some of these properties values require pretty much effort for generation, e. g. the process name. Those properties generated values are emusuallyem not changed, BUT despite this fact it should be possible to change them. p  pI considered the prototype pattern starting with a protoype, whose generic properties are preallocated. The protoype stays the same object during the lifetime of the application, but its properties values might change as described above. New LogEvent objects should use the current prototypes values, objects created before the change should continue using the old values, that means, referencing the prototype from the real LogEvent object is not an option.p  pHowever the real LogEvent requires some properties to be not null, whereas this requirement is not useful for the prototype. I would like to prevent invalid objects of LogEvent. However if I use usual protoype pattern I would have to add a constructor to create the prototype, but this constructor would not create a valid object and I want to avoid, that an invalid object the prototype itself or a clone of it is used accidentally.p  pI spent some time on searching a solution, but the approaches listed below are pretty ugly.

Negative 174 pIm designing a web application to support use of a CDN in the future.p  pTwo options Ive consideredp  ol liUse domain aliasing for static content on the site, including CSS, JS, and some images.li liUse edge side includes to designate static content regions.li ol  p1 is simpler and Ive implemented it before.

The drawback Ive heard from users of our internal preproduction site is that they would have to push the images to images1.mysite.com to preview their changes internally  ideally, files would not get pushed to images1.mysite.com until theyre ready for production. NOTE  hosts file changes and DNS tricks are not an option here.p  pInstead, they would like to simply use relative or absolute paths for static content. e.g. imagesmyimage.gifp  p2 is not as familiar to me and I would like more info.

Negative 174 pI need an encryption scheme where the plaintext and ciphertext are composed entirely of decimal digits.p  pIn addition, the plaintext and ciphertext must be the same length.p  pAlso the underlying encryption algorithm should be an industrystandard. I dont mind if its symmetric e.g AES or asymmetric e.g RSA  but it must be a recognized algorithm for which I can get a FIPS140 approved library. Otherwise it wont get past the security review stage.p  pUsing AES OFB is fine for preserving the length of hexbased input i.e. where each byte has 256 possible values 0x00  0xFF. However, this will not work for my means as plaintext and ciphertext must be entirely decimal.p  pNB Entirely decimal may be interpreted two ways  both of which are acceptable for my requirementsp  ol liInput amp output bytes are characters 0  9 i.e. byte values 0x30  0x39li liInput amp output bytes have the 100 decimal values 0x00  0x99 i.e. BCDli ol  pSome more info The max plaintext amp ciphertext length is likely to be 10 decimal digits.

It is in C and predates the nHibernate port and Entity Framework etc.  All user input is sent using ADO.NET SqlParameter objects, it is just the identifier names that I am concerned about in this question.  This needs to work on SQL Server 2005 and 2008.p  hr  pUpdate on 20100331p  pWhile the application is not supposed to allow userinput for identifier names in queries, the ORM does via the query syntax that it has for both ORMstyle reads and custom queries.

Calculating Levelshtein takes about forever for images bigger then a few hundred by a few hundred pixels.

Negative 174 pWhile coding JavaScript sometimes you store the reference of object codethiscode in a local variable for different purposes to set proper scope, to help code obfuscators, etc.. There are coders who prefer aliasing codethiscode to codethatcode to make it obvious its intention. Other guys use codeselfcode since its pointing to the object itself. I even saw source codes where codemecode held the reference and it still makes sense. Certainly there are other ones.p  pWhich one should I prefer Is there a convention on which to use or is it only the matter of taste.p

Negative 174 pI would like to ask about the design of table based on its editability in a Grid View. Let me explain. For example, I have a table named ProductCustomerRel.p  pMethod 1p  precodeCustomerCode varchar  PK ProductCode varchar  PK StoreCode varchar PK Quantity int Note text codepre  pSo the combination of the CustomerCode, StoreCode and ProductCode must be unique. The record is displayed on a gridview. The requirement is that you can edit the customer, product and storecode but when the data is saved, the PK constraint must still persist. p  pThe problem here is it would be natural for a grid to be able to edit the 3 primary key, you can only achieve the update operation of the grid view by first deleting the row and then inserting the row with the updated data.p  pAn alternative to this is to just update the table and add a SeqNo, and just enforce the unique constraint of the 3 columns when inserting and updating in the grid view.p  pMethod 2p  precodeSeqNo int PK CustomerCode varchar ProductCode varchar StoreCode varchar Quantity int Note text codepre  pMy question is which of the two method is better or is there another way to do thisp

Negative 174 pI have a ASP gridview control. I have a ASP label control in the item template column. I bind data to the grid using  p  precodeltItemTemplategt         ltaspLabel IDlblDesc runatserver Textlt EvalDescription gtgtltaspLabelgt ltItemTemplategt codepre  pBut, the value of this string can be upto 80 characters. But, I cannot afford to have the column length to be so high. And, there are limitations so I cannot use codeWraptruecode and limit the column width.p  pSo, I figured the solution could be to display only about 50 characters in the grid and display the entire string as a tool tip. I managed to do this by using this  p  precodeltItemTemplategt         ltaspLabel IDlblDesc runatserver Textlt EvalDescription.ToString.Substring0,50 gt ToolTiplt EvalDescription gtgtltaspLabelgt ltItemTemplategt codepre  pThis displays the first 50 characters of the string in the grid column. And, the complete string is displayed as a tool tip when the mouse pointer hovers over the text. But, the problem arises when the string length is less than 50 characters. In this case, an exception is thrown.p  pI tried modifying this piece of code to allow conditional display by checking for the string length. But, I could not get this to work. p  pIs there a way to fix this problem Can we call a javascript function within Eval  p
Negative 174 pThe void checkboard function is not working. This is a tic tac toe game. So that function checks after each move if someone has won the game or if it is a tie. After someone wins or there is a tie the board is to be reset and the game startover. I just cannot get the void checkboard function to work. Please help me solve this problem. p  pcheckboard should check every users input to see if that play has won. So checkboard has to check to see if playerOne has Xs in a line or diagonally or if playerTwo has Os in that way either or if there is a tie. If the player wins or there is a draw it tells who won or that there is a tie and then ask the user if they want to play again or exit the program. From their response the board is reset or the game exits.p  pThe problem i think is that bGameOver keeps coming out true no matter what.

Negative 174 pemsee editsemp  pIm developing a QTc application under gnome. p  pThe application a main window and QListBox child window. p  pBoth of these windows show up as separate main windows when I alttab away from the application. p  pHow can I make it so that only one window is shown when I or later the user uses alttabp  pI am guessing this behavior comes because one main window doesnt clip the subwindow  the subwindow extends the boundary of the main window. Gnome has bad alttab behavior for a number of other applications too, showing modal dialog boxes separately from main windows. But in the case of my app, this is really annoying. p  pI am thinking I could make a giant transparent window that includes both existing windows. But it would be nicer to find a clean solution. p  pthe most logical guess is indeed that it has something to do with window flags. Ive tried every reasonable combination of flags I could think of. The window types are described a hrefhttpdoc.qt.nokia.com4.6qt.htmlWindowTypeenum relnofollowhereap  pEdit The app has a QWidget as its main window Not QMainWindow, QListView is contained in the QWidget object and created by passing a point to the main window.   is styled with QtTool  QtFramelessWindowHint. p  pstrongEdit2strong The QtX11BypassWindowManagerHint style strongdoesstrong work to remove the window from the alttab list. The problem is that it also makes the window unmanaged so it cover the other windows. I could manaully hide whenever I lose focus  prize now for a better solution. p

Negative 174 pSo I have setup a scroll listenerp  precodewindow.onscroll  function      alertwindow.pageYOffset  have also tested with window.scrollY  codepre  pAnd, as expected, I get my alerts once scroll is complete. I have the debug console, turned off for this as well, so as not to add any extra space in the mobile browser, hence doing the alert and not console.log. p  pNow, I am also doing this onload p  precodesetTimeoutfunction      window.scrollTo0, 0 , 33 codepre  pAnd, as expected, the navigation bar hides on load. I tried just doing the window.scrollTo without the timeout, and it was failing until I added the timeout. Anyway, thats not the issue. My navigation bar hides, which is what I wanted. p  pSo now that I have my viewport moved to 0,0 and and alert firing on scroll, I would expect that the act of dragging my finger down scrolling up to reveal the Navigation Bar would tell me that window.pageOffsetY lt 0 or window.scrollY is lt 0. That is not the case. Instead my alerts tell me 0 in both cases, even though I have scrolled up to reveal those 60px 120px on retina of the browser Navigation Bar. p  pMy question is strongIs there a way to tell if you are scrolling into the Navigation Bar spacestrong p  pThe ultimate goal for this is to have something always positioned at the bottom. I have my element doing that on scroll properly except when I start entering into the Navigation Bar scroll space as mobile safari reports the scrollY  pageYOffset as 0 even though there is some more scroll action happening.p

Negative 174 pI have a Windows 7 box with multiple VMWare Player machines that are started on boot. I use WMWare VIX and a batch file to shutdown the virtual machines like so  p  precodeCpathtoVMWare VIXvmrun.exe T player stop Cpathtomachine.vmx soft codepre  pWhat I want to accomplish is to run these commands when the host machine is shut down, so that I dont need to shut down each VM separately. When deployed, shutdowns will likely be started with a short press of the ACPI power button, not from the Start menu. Ways Ive tried that dont work at least not well enough  p  ol lipGroup Policies  The most obvious way to go, but in Windows 7, the option to run shutdown scripts asynchronously is gone.br The result is that Windows emfirstem tells all open windows to close, the VMs respond that they are in use and you get the Force close dialog. Only emafterem VMWare Player and everything else is closed are the scripts run, to no use.br Youd think this could be changed, but I think I remember seeing some official MS note along the lines of nope, sorry. Cant find the link though.pli lipUse one batch file that closes all VMs and then shutdowns the host as a desktop shortcut instead of the usual shutdown button.  Works, and thats about what Im using right now while developing.br But using the ACPI power button initiates a normal shutdown with the same result as earlier, and it would be better if the enduser who turns the machine on and off on a daily basis wouldnt need to use a monitor and mouse.br So what Im googling for at the moment is a way to modify the action called when pressing the physical power button. Windows allows you to choose between some different actions like Sleep, Hibernate, Restart etc, but could you change that into Run this .bat Or maybe change the behaviour of the shutdown command altogetherpli lipProgrammatically intercept the shutdown message, abort shutdown, run batch file, reinitiate shutdown. There has been some discussion on intercepting shutdown e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1184940programmaticallypreventwindowstoshutdownherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3490252interceptshutdowninwindowsusingvbscriptherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2487185blockwindowsshutdownherea, but Im still too much of a n00b in all languages except maybe Ruby or Java to really understand if and how it could be done in this case. If someone can clarify how to actually make this work without getting stuck on the Force close screen then Im eager to try out any language you offer.pli ol  pThankful for any help and ideas.p

Negative 174 pIn many C libraries, there is a printfstyle routine which is something like the followingp  pre int vgprintfvoid info, voidprintfunctionvoid, char, const char format, valist params pre  pwhich will format the supplied string and call printfunction with the passedin info value and each character in sequence.  A function like fprintf will pass vgprintf the passedin file parameter and a pointer to a function which will cast its void to a FILE and output the passedin character to that file.  A function like snprintf will create a struct holding a char and length, and pass the address of that struct to a function which will output each character in sequence, space permitting.p  pIs there any standard for such a function, which could be used if e.g. one wanted a function to output an arbitrary format to a TCP port  A common approach is to allocate a buffer one hopes is big enough, use snprintf to put the data there, and then output the data from the buffer.  It would seem cleaner, though, if there were a standard way to to specify that the print formatter should call a usersupplied routine with each character.p

Negative 174 pI am attempting to apply the Strategy pattern to a particular situation, but am having an issue with how to avoid coupling each concrete strategy to the context object providing data for it. The following is a simplified case of a pattern that occurs a few different ways, but should be handled in a similar way.p  pWe have an object codeAcquisitioncode that provides data relevant to a specific frame of time  basically a bunch of external data collected using different pieces of hardware. Its already too large because of the amount of data it contains, so I dont want to give it any further responsibility. We now need to take some of this data, and based on some configuration send a corresponding voltage to a piece of hardware.p  pSo, imagine the following much simplified classesp  precodeclass Acquisition      public Int32 IntegrationTime  get set      public Double Battery  get set      public Double Signal  get set    interface IAnalogOutputter      double getVoltageAcquisition acq   class BatteryAnalogOutputter  IAnalogOutputter      double getVoltageAcquisition acq              return acq.Battery       codepre  pNow, every concrete strategy class has to be coupled to my Acquisition class, which is also one of the most likely classes to be modified since its core to our application. This is still an improvement over the old design, which was a giant switch statement eminsideem the codeAcquisitioncode class. Each type of data may have a different conversion method while Battery is a simple passthrough, others are not at all that simple, so I feel Strategy pattern or similar should be the way to go.p  pI will also note that in the final implementation, codeIAnalogOutputtercode would be an abstract class instead of an interface. These classes will be in a list that is configurable by the user and serialized to an XML file. The list must be editable at runtime and remembered, so Serializable must be part of our final solution. In case it makes a difference.p  pHow can I ensure each implementation class gets the data it needs to work, without tying it to one of my most important classes Or am I approaching this sort of problem in the completely wrong mannerp

My intuition tells me that this method will move all elements after insertpoint a step backward, which may cause severe performance deduction.

Negative 174 pI am developing a Facebook app that uses a hrefhttpdocumentcloud.github.combackbonebackbone.jsa 0.3.3 and am trying to get the back button to work properly for users.p  pBackbone saves the state through the URL hash, which is used to do internal routing. For example, codehomecode will load the homepage and codesessioncode is another page. History is saved when this happens outside an iframe, so you can navigate correctly using the back button.p  pNavigation inside the iframe is not the problem, and all the links work, but no history is saved by the browser.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pThe Facebook iframe points to codehttpapp.example.comcode, which is the Backbone application. strongHow can I get the back button to work for the user on the Facebook appstrong Bonus points for an existing solution using Backbone.p  hr  pI have looked into this question from several angles and cant find a satisfactory solution available anywhere. It seems like very few Facebook apps use backbonerely so much on Javascript.p  pI think that the solution is to add history states to the parent window of the iframe, but I dont know how to do that.

Negative 174 pWCF does not support request streaming aka streaming upload of large data over HTTP with HTTP authentication. My first guess was it is because of authentication handshake causing the streaming request to be send twice to the server. But that is also the case for large request in buffered mode so it doesnt make sense.p  pYou can easily implement request streaming with HTTP authentication in custom ASP.NET http handler. If you have control over the client you can even avoid multiple requests problem by doing explicit HTTP HEAD to preauthenticate to server and then reuse persistent connection to do the actual streaming request with HTTP POST.p  pSo can anybody think of the reasons WCF not supporting this other than no time to do thatp  pThanksp

Negative 174 pDisclaimer Ok, so I know its super easy to make a top notification bar by hiding a div w jQuery at the top of the page and add an event handler to it.p  pDilemma I need to incorporate a notification bar on a page that has the bg image set to the body, so when you show a div at the top it pushes all content down wo pushing the bg down and throws off the entire site. Im trying to avoid wrapping all the content in a div and switching the bg css over to that div in fear of throwing off other child elements styles. p  pIf anyone is aware of method to push ALL page content down including the  content I would greatly appreciate any wisdom. p

Negative 174 pAbstract Descriptionp  pI have a set of strings, call it the active set, and a set of sets of strings  call that the possible set.  When a new string is added to the active set, sets from the possible set may suddenly be subsets of the active set because the active set lacked only that string to be a superset of one of the possibles.  I need an algorithm to efficiently find these when I add a new string to the active set.  Bonus points if the same data structure allows me to efficiently find which of these possible sets are eminvalidatedem no longer a subset when a string is emremovedem from the active set.p  pThe reason I framed the problem described below in terms of sets and subsets of strings in the abstract above is that the language Im writing this in Io is dynamically typed.  Objects do have a type field but it is a string with the name of the object type in it.p  pBackgroundp  pIn my game engine I have emGameObjectsem which can have several types of emRepresentationem objects added to them.  For instance if a GameObject has physical presence it might have a PhysicsRepresentation added to it or not if its not a solid object.  It might have various kinds of GraphicsRepresentations added to it, such as a mesh or particle effect and you can have more than one if you have multiple visual effects attached to the same game object.p  pThe point of this is to separate subsystems, but you cant completely separate everything  for instance when a GameObject has both a PhysicsRepresentation and a GraphicsRepresentation, something needs to create a 3rd object which connects the position of the GraphicsRepresentation to the location of the PhysicsRepresentation.  To serve this purpose while still keeping all the components separate, I have emInteractionem objects.  The Interaction object encapsulates the crosscutting knowledge about how two system components have to interact.p  pBut in order to protect GameObject from having to know too much about Representations and Interactions, GameObject just provides a generic registry where Interaction prototype objects can register to be called when a particular combination of Representations is present in the GameObject.  When a new Representation is added to the GameObject, GameObject should look in its registry and activate just those Interaction objects which are newly enabled by the presence of the new Representation, plus the existing Representations.p  pIm just stuck on what data structure should be used for this registry and how to search it.p  pErratap  pThe sets of strings are not necessarily sorted, but I can choose to store them sorted.p  pAlthough an Interaction most commonly will be between two Representations, I do not want to limit it to that I should be able to have Interactions that trigger with 3 or more different representations, or even interactions that trigger based on just 1 representation.p  pI want to optimize this for the case of making it as fast as possible to addremove representations.p  pI will have many active sets each game object has an active set, but I have only one possible set the set of all registered interaction types.  So I dont care how long it takes to build the data structure that represents the possible set, because it only needs to be done once provided the algorithm for comparing different active sets is nondestructive of the possible set data structure.p

Negative 174 pI am making a server and I use fork for creating child processes but I have doubts about that. Here are somep  ol liWhy do you need to close main socket in a child process and new connection accepted socket in the parent process after accepting a new connection I thought that sockets are only integers with some id which are used to access opened sockets in some systemwide object which is only acceptable through system functions calls. In that case fork would only copy the integer but would have no affect on socket opened.li liI have checked and found out that if I fork a process inside a class method, all members are copied. Well, I have found out it is copyonedit so does it mean that my server class will be copied in each child that uses a nonconstant function How do I make some memory shared between all such processes like a list of tasks and each child puts something into it while the parent is reading stuff from it I guess fork is not the right function for that. What is the best wayli ol  pP.S. I am pretty sure I know the answer to the second question, which is clone, but just wanted to make sure thats the right function.p

Negative 174 pI need a way to get an orientation local xyz axes at any point along a spline... where the zaxis is always the spline tangent and xy are perpendicular to each other and z.p  pOne common technique is to calculate one axis vector as the rate of change of the tangent, i.e. codext  zt X ztdtcode Then y is simply codex X zcode.p  pHowever I am not sure this gives what Id call the natural orientation path. What I mean by that is, imagine I have a rigid steel rod which is bend into some set of curls and I then advance a flexible hose along this rod. If friction is neglible, the natural path would mean the hose ends up with minimum torque at any point, as it would untwist itself to get a lowerenergy state.p  pIs there any way to do this which doesnt mean traversing the splines length from 0t to find the transform at a given point tp

Negative 174 pI have an old SWF project file which is a series of png sequence to produce a 3D tour of numerous stadiums If you can get it to load a hrefhttptinyurl.com7h2zpcb relnofollowhttptinyurl.com7h2zpcba. When I initially created it I never intended it to be published on the web it was a university project however I now would quite like to show it on the internet. The structure is of a main timeline with 4 stadiums each with a png sequence, then, when clicking on one of the stadiums, 4 more png sequences. The only problem is that it is all in one file and is over 12mb, plus has no preloader. p  pIt is written in AS3 and is rather complicated as I used movie names and trimming to have reusable functions. It does however have global variables already setup if this could help.p  pI have 2 questions. First, is there an easy method of separating out the project movies to 5 individual swf files. i.e main timeline, and each individual png sequence Or will I need to copy and paste and copy assets over to each FLA file p  pSecondly, would it just be easier to try using a preloaded and hoping that users wait for the project to download p  pIf you have any thoughts on this please give them. Is there a way to optimise the project in another way I am unaware of As a side note there are a lot of pngs and total over 300mb when combined so I think XML is out of the question p  pThank you for your time. Any suggestions are welcome p

Negative 174 pI have a Window with an ItemsControl that places symbols on a map. The symbols are rather complex each one is composed of several UserControls.p  pI have a handful of scenarios, and each scenario places a unique set of symbols on the map. There is a dropdown menu that allows the user to switch between scenarios. p  pIf the user switches to Scenario A which has 22 symbols, the entire map refreshes in one shot.p  pIf the user switches to Scenario B which has 39 symbols, the map appears to refresh twice. Some parts of the symbols are drawn, then a brief moment later, the remaining parts of the symbols are drawn. In the end, the symbols appear correctly, but the twostage refresh is very awkward and looks unprofessional. It would be as if you were trying to place a bunch of cars on a road map, and instead of the cars just appearing, first the bodies of cars appeared, then a moment later, the wheels and mirrors appeared.p  pIn trying to debug this, I thought about what was different between the two scenarios, and really the only thing I could think of was that the number of symbols were different. The differences in the particular attributes all seemed pretty random. So, I ran a test with just the first 22 symbols of Scenario B. The map refreshed in one shot. I upped the number of symbols several times, and the map still updated in one shot. When I reached 38 symbols, however, the map updated in two stages again. Just in case there was something strange about the last two symbols, I tried skipping the first two then grabbing the remaining 37, but the map updated in one shot again. Finally, I tried skipping the first symbol then grabbing the remaining 38. Now it was back to updating the map in two stages.p  pBottom line if the ItemsControl tries to render 38 or more symbols at once, it happens in two stages, otherwise, it happens in one. Id like the map to refresh in one stage regardless of the number of symbols.p  pFrom what Ive read about WPF virtualization, I dont believe this behavior qualifies as virtualization because, once the rendering is complete, none of the symbols are hidden or offscreen. My monitor is large enough that there are no active scroll bars.p  pSo, Im completely mystified by what Im experiencing here. Any ideas appreciated.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI tried setting the Visibility to Hidden, then performing the update, then setting the Visibility back to Visible. Makes no difference. The map still refreshed in to stages. I also tried Collapsed instead of Hidden, still didnt work.p

Negative 174 pI am trying to refactor some delphi 7 code. One of the procedures Id like to move uses a data type called TLVColumn appears to be a TListView column header. However, if I move the method, I get an undeclared identifier error, presumedly because I didnt copy the import which defines TLVColumn to the new unit. The unit Im moving this method from has over 7000 lines of code and over 50 uses classes listed. Is there any more efficient way than trial and error of copying random imports to identify which import is required for a particular class especially imports that are from Delphi libraries and not from my own codebase...p
Negative 174 pI have a grid with a menu and a scrollviewer inside. In the scrollviewer i have a groupbox with another grid and inside a webbrowser element.p  pNow the problem arises when i make my window smaller than the content of my webbrowser content, and scroll down in the scrollviewer. Everything has a margin so it stays below the top menu, however the webbrowser element does not, hence covering the menu. Is there a way to solve this I cant figure it out s Margins amp Paddings dont work. I was hoping the grid element around it or something would do the trick, but nothing works.p  pEDITp  pOk I tried to add the xaml code but bear in mind it was insanely huge, so this is the extreme short version webbrowser element is at the bottom of the codep  precodeltWindow xClassCleaningMastersOfficial.MainWindow         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         TitleCleaning Masters Offerte Packet  nieuw.off NameMain  WidthDynamicResource xStatic SystemParameters.MaximizedPrimaryScreenWidthKey         IconbinDebugImagesMain.ico     HeightDynamicResource xStatic SystemParameters.MaximizedPrimaryScreenHeightKey ClosingMainClosing     WindowStartupLocationCenterScreen WindowStyleSingleBorderWindow WindowStateMaximizedgt      ltGridgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition Height22 gt             ltRowDefinition Height gt             ltRowDefinition Namerowbar Height0 gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltScrollViewer Margin10 Grid.Row1gt             ltTabControl NametabChaptersgt                  ltTabItem HeaderAlgemeen NametabGeneralgt                     ltGridgt                         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                             ltColumnDefinition Width gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width gt                         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                             ltRowDefinition Heightauto gt                             ltRowDefinition Height gt                         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                          ltGroupBox HeaderConfigureer hoofdstukken Margin10 Padding10gt                             ltGridgt                                 ...                                  ltGridgt                         ltGroupBoxgt                          ltGroupBox HeaderVoorpagina Afbeeldingen Margin10,0,10,10 Padding10 Grid.Column0 Grid.Row1 Grid.ColumnSpan2gt                             ltGrid VerticalAlignmentTopgt                                 ...                                  ltGridgt                         ltGroupBoxgt                          ltGroupBox HeaderOfferte Info Margin10,10,10,10 Padding10 Grid.Column1 Grid.Row0gt                             ltGridgt                                 ...                                  ltGridgt                         ltGroupBoxgt                          ltGroupBox Margin0,10,10,10 HeaderInhoudstafel Grid.Column2 Grid.RowSpan2gt                             ltGridgt                                 ltWebBrowser Margin10 NamewbInhoudstafelgt                             ltGridgt                         ltGroupBoxgt                     ltGridgt                 ltTabItemgt                  ltTabItem Header1.

Negative 174 pI consistently run into the need to clean up css files and strip unused css elements. I am aware that google chrome has the capability to display all the unused css elements on a page but there are times like a project I am working on right now where the original designer left hundreds of unused elements within this file.p  pSo, my question here is  does anyone know of a way to customize the google chrome developer console to export a list of all used CSS elements. Or, is anyone aware of an existing google chrome plugin which provides this functionalityp  pI realize there is a firefox plugin which provides these capabilities but I would love to find a similar solution for google chrome.p  pThanksp

Negative 174 pI am having difficulty using Boost Unit Test and OpenCV Ptrs. I always get some sort of memory leak program compiles but the unittest fails because of some deallocated pointers. I work mostly with IplImage pointers that needed to get released somewhere in the code. I tried to use boost smart pointers that point to opencv objects, pure pointers and manually releasing those IplImages and finally I tried opencv smart pointers cvPtr. But I always end up having a memory leak somewhere usually when I break or continue a BOOSTFOREACH loop. I used to have similar problems before when I worked with OSG smart pointers and boost unittests. Therefore I am asking if anyone had similar experience and if they somehow managed to solve this problem. I will try to post a minimalist code that fails for me if this help diagnose the problem.p  pJosep

Negative 174 pin my page i have a main swf, which should check the existence of a second swf  if its missing, the main swf should display a certain message to the user, otherwise it should work as planned.p  pi thought to achieve this by using LocalConnection  the main swf is set as the sending swf, and it should call a certain function on the other swf.  i was thinking that if the second swf is missing, the local connection would fail  either throw an error or its STATUS event listener would receive an error in the events level property.p  pif you think as i did  well think again.  no error was thrown and the listener got a status in the events level property, although theres nobody to handle the LocalConnection send method.p  pwhat did i miss  or is there a better way to achieve my goalp  pcheers,p  peRezp

Negative 174 pWe have a fairly rich elearning app, built mostly using cocos2d.

This would be Project.xcodeproj and ProjectMac.xcodeprojli liAdd a new Mac target to our existing iPad application project and then fiddle with target membership to get the desired results.  This would be just Project.xcodeprojli ol  pFurther complicating the situation is that we currently use cocos2d as a static library for the iOS app.  We also have a library called CoreInfrastructure that has a lot of code we use across all our projects.  Recently I have figured out that I can create a project to simultaneously build a framework targeting Mac and a library targeting iOS from the same code base.  This is done by starting with a framework project and adding a target to build a static lib for iOS.p  pSo just wanted to get everyones opinion and insight.

Negative 174 pIm working on my first program in Java that will be used for a practical purpose and Im stuckgetting an output that isnt correct.p  pHere is the problem Im trying to compute the manufacturing plant I work at operates 247, 363 days a year off Christmas Eve and Christmas in four day shifts. Each crew works 4 twelve hour days or nights in a row, then gets 4 days off. There are four crews, each works four days, then has four days off, then works four nights, then has four nights off. A Crew and B Crew rotate opposite of each other, and C Crew and D Crew rotate opposite of each other. p  pWhile A Crew and B Crew are working, members of C Crew and D Crew are on call in case someone on A or B Crew is absent. There are three classifications of employees Senior operators, Junior Operators, and Compounders. On each crew, there are four Senior operators, three Junior operators, and 2 Compounders. For the first two days of a four day rotation cycle, three of the Senior operators are on call, while the fourth is not on call. The Senior operator who is not on call during this period rotates one is not on call each time the others are on call.  For the last two days, the three Junior operators are on call. p  pFor the Senior employees, the previous cycle determines if they are on call for day shifts or night shifts if the crew that is not working had been working day shifts, the senior operators are on call for the first two day shifts, or vice versa if they had been working nights during the previous cycle. For the Junior operators, the cycle they are about to begin dictates whether they are on call day shifts or night shifts for the second two days off. p  pThe Compounders are on call for the first and fourth days off. Whether they are on call days or nights is determined in the same way as for operators. p  pMy goal is to write a program in Java that calculates which employees are on call for each day and night shift, and output the results to a text file. I am an amateur that has only taken two programming classes thus far, so I am certain that what I have written so far is far less efficient than it could be. I am just trying to figure out why the output is incorrect. My suspicion is that I have either calculated a variable incorrectly or I am missing a piece of the puzzle altogether. Note that the first day of the year for the purposes of the program is January 3rd because the 1st and 2nd were part of the previous years cycle. p  pBelow is my code. I removed all getters and setters to fit within the allotted length. I appreciate any and all help that can be offered. p  precode    import java.io.File     import java.io.PrintWriter     import java.text.SimpleDateFormat     import java.util.Calendar     import

Negative 174 pi am trying to include a php header inside each of the pages i make. Now as far as i know, it can be done by using codeltphp includeheader.php gtcodeinside each file.p  pNow my problem is that i have 5 pages, and in the header php i have a nav which links to each of  this pages. When i load the header i would like to change the link of the file which the header is loaded on.p  pEx if i open the Home page, i want the header to have the link inside the header nav bolded. That would probably require me to send a variable to the header file when i include it or smt if so, than how to do that  Dp  pThank you in advance, Danielp

You then add a special entry to a configuration profile that includes your applications bundle ID. p  pThis works great if you utilize Apple Configurator to add the new profile AND application you want to use as the kiosk app.p  pHowever, if you dont use Apple Configurator to add the profile and application aka you use Xcode or MDM, an error will appear on the iPadp  pstrongGuided Access app unavailable.

Negative 174 pIn my application I have a singleton class for centrally storing my application data. I also load and save the objects here using nskeyarchiver. I have a management class where I create a series of numbersequencer instances initialized with the sequenceCollection from the Singleton class.

I can save using NSkeyArchiver and the values written are correct. If however I change the values by calling the loadProjectWithName method in the Singleton the source sequenceCollection is changed however the evntSequencers and the self.sequence and self.times within the numbersequencer instances are not updated and contain different values.

Negative 174 pIve created an isometric environment, all in Javascript and HTML5 2D Canvas, which mostly works fine. The problem Im facing is to do with having different height tiles and then sorting the indexes of objects on the tiles in this case, while moving between two tiles sidebyside.p  pFor example, one object may be behind a tile in front of it because the height of the tile it is on is 1. The solution I came up with was to draw each object of a tile directly after drawing the tile, starting at 0,0 and drawing each row and column from there. p  pThis works well until I need to transition an object between two tiles. At this point, either the object must use an intermediate tile this is what is implemented in the images below or the tile will overlap the object as the tile is drawn after the object. Using an intermediate tile also gives a problem where the fence object on the same row gets draw over because the cube is using much higher zindex from the tile at 1,3 this is slightly visible in image 1.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPQJ0H.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comPQJ0H.pngap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comDupM7.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comDupM7.pngap  pI think the tried and tested way of drawing isometric environments is just to have 1 layer for tiles and 1 layer for objects and then objects can never be behind tiles, but this is just a limitation that I dont want to adhere to.p  pSo my question is, when drawing the entire environment from top to bottom or any other way if it makes it possible, drawing each tile and its objects in turn, is there a clever way to defer drawing of an object or create an array of objects to be drawn in the correct order Has anyone else encountered similar issues and has anyone else found any solutions for thisp  pAll help much appreciated.p  pAn example of my tiling codep  precode each column fory0 ylttotalColumns y      each row     forx0 xlttotalRows x         tile  tiles[y][x]          draw tile         drawTiletile         objects  objects[y][x]          draw objects for that tile         drawObjectsobjects       codepre  pEditp  pOne solution I have thought of after reading the question back to myself is to loop through all the tiles, get an array of tile heights, sort that, then do the traditional drawing. Like sop  precodevar layers  []  forvar y0 yltcols y     forvar x0 xltrows x         tile  tiles[y][x]         iflayers.indexOftile.height layers.pushtile.height         sort layers layers.sortfunction here to sort layers  forl0 lltlayers.length l      draw tiles for this layer       draw objects for this layer   codepre  pAny other solutions possiblep

Negative 174 pI need to draw some text inside a rectangle, using SVG. I have icons defined by paths, and I have arbitrarily chosen text canvas areas for each icon, based upon the shape of the icon. What I need to do is to draw some text which can change with each request, such that the text is centred horizontally and vertically within my textcanvas area, and resize the font used so that it will fit perfectly inside the canvas.p  pWhat Ive been doing up to now is to generate the raw image using Batik and then using java.awt to draw the text on top of it. This has been done by starting with a fontheight of 80 of the canvas area and then checking the width of the rendered font using font metrics and  if its greater than the width of the canvas area  reducing it by 5 at a time until it fits. If it fits first time then no looping is involved, so its still relatively efficient at least for the foreseeable future.p  pThis approach falls down on several areas though, most significantly when dealing with adding a stroke to the icon, as the bounding box of the icon changes unpredictably as the stroke increases, and so I was hoping to draw the font within the SVG itself.p  pCan I use a similar approach to resize the font until it fits, in SVGBatik How would I do this Can someone point me to a good resource for this I havent found a suitable answer on GoogleStackoverflow but if Ive missed an obvious one, please do send me there instead.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 174 pI need to place a background image in a Google Chart. Ive seen solutions which suggest including the chart in a parent div and setting a background image for the parent div. However, if I do that then the background image will also cover the area outside the chart where the axis labels and legend, etc are displayed. I want my image in the chart area itself only.p  pAlternatively, is there any way to retrieve the chart options so that I could use chartArea.top, chartArea.left, chartArea.width and chartArea.height to overlay an image on the chart in the correct placep  pMany thanks, Chrisp

Negative 174 pIm working on a rails 3 app that uses trinidad. Ive been using RubyMine4.5, but cant for the life of me figure out how to debug the app. It runs fine from the IDE in nondebug mode, but when you try to debug it says that it cant debug trinidad apps. Why does it say thisp  pI have also tried running trinidad and rdebug from the command line and then attach to it from RubyMine using a remote debug config. I am able to attach but I cant set any breakpoints. And also changes to ruby code dont appear to be taking affect without restarting.p  pI thought Id mostly worked around these problems by using Webrick when debugging from RubyMine. In which case I am able to set and hit breakpoints, but still for some reason any changes I make to ruby code do not take affect until I restart the server. In fact the only way Im able to change ruby code onthefly is when Im running the app in nondebug mode.p  pSo what Id like to be able to do is use trinidad from RubyMine to debug and also be able to change ruby code on the fly. Or, if thats not possible, use Webrick from RubyMine and also be able to change code onthefly.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 174 pBecause the trie data structure has such a huge branching factor and each subtree is totally independent of the others, it seems like there ought to be a way to enormously speed up trie construction for a given dictionary by adding all the words in parallel.p  pMy initial idea on how to do this was the following associate a mutex with each pointer in the trie including the pointer to the root and then have each thread follow the normal algorithm for inserting a word into the trie.  However, before following any pointers, a thread must first acquire the lock on that pointer so that if it needs to add a new child node to the trie, it can do so without introducing any data races.p  pThe catch with this approach is that it uses an emenormousem number of locks  one for each pointer in the trie  and does an emenormousem number of acquires and releases  one for each character in each input string.p  pIs there a way to build a trie in parallel without using nearly as many locksp

Also suppose Im only actively using 1 Detail, while there are actually 100 details connected to MyItem. This means that whenever I access MyItem from the SLC and access the one detail Im interested in, the whole collection is materializedp  precode Get item coming from SLC MyItem myItem  nhSession.Getid   Access detail, materializing all MyDetails from SLC MyDetail myDetail  myItem.Details[Interesting]   Normally, this last line will invoke the default NH proxy  which then materializes the Details collections, fetching  all details belonging to myItem from the database, or from  the SLC for that matter.   To cater for my scenario, Ive got access to an interceptor  to do my own processing the details to how this is hooked  up are not very relevant. This interceptor should somehow  be able to, instead of initializing the collection, return  the result from the SLC rightaway. This would prevent  the materialization of possibly large collections. codepre  h1Solving the optimization problemh1  pNow Id like to optimize this scenario by bypassing the collection loading, and directly querying the SLC for presence of that detail. Note that my problem is not intercepting the actual detail call from the code, but intervening in what is returned in what way.p  pIm using the SysCache, so theoretically I could read out the ASP.NET cache, but since the cache keys are an implementation detail of NH, Im not sure thats a good idea.p  pDoes anyone have a pointer for mep

Negative 174 pIn my web application I am using Spring Security and Spring MVC. I have secured a couple of methods with codeSecuredcode annotation and configured Spring Security in such a way that when one of those methods is accessed without the proper role, the user is taken to the login page.

Negative 174 pI was recently given a VB.NET project for fixing some bugs and creating an installer for it. I was told to use Install Shield LE.p  pAll went well with creating the install script but Windows 8 is giving me a smart screen warning when downloading the application from a web site and trying to install it. p  pI am aware of Windows 8 policy where popular applications get more trust points and become popular but the application is targeted for a fairly small audience of people therefore we can not rely on this option. Even more, people without proper knowledge would be repelled by the warning message and that could cause MS to never raise the trust for the application.p  pMy question is, do I have to sign both  the application and the installer with a certificate If so how do I sign the installer, as there is a signing tab for the project but I cant find one for the installer.p  pBonus points if anyone can tell me if acquiring a proper certificate will remove the warning message telling strongthis isnt a commonly downloaded file and might be dangerousstrong from chromeIE when downloading the application. emThere are many threads about this, I know, but most of them suggest adding the site to webmaster tools but that hasnt helped and were still receiving the messageemp  pThanks.p

Negative 174 pIn a JavaSwing application we redirected System.out and System.err to a separate view called SystemOutView which pops open when a new output occurs. This works fine for thrown exceptions and codeSystem.out.printlncode. This view can be configured via a property file i.e. if it is active at all and if it pops open on output or not.p  pIn this project we are using log4j 1.2.15. I found that the log4j outputs, even though sent to STDOUT, are NOT being redirected to the SystemOutView if some logging already took place BEFORE the SystemOutView was instantiated and System.out and System.err were redirected to it.p  pIn other wordsp  ol liRedirect System.out and System.err to SystemOutViewli lisomeLogger.debug...li ol  p... works fine The log appears in the SystemOutView.p  pBUTp  ol lisomeLogger.debug...li liRedirect System.out and System.err to SystemOutViewli lisomeLogger.debug...li ol  p... does NOT work the 2nd log statement goes to STDOUT like the 1st one and is NOT being redirected to SystemOutView.p  pSince the SystemOutView can be configured via a property file, there is a whole bunch of work being done before SystemOutView gets instantiated, so its very likely that some log statements are being issued. Which makes it impossible then to redirect the log output to the SystemOutView.p  pWhat can I do about that p  pMany thanx in advancebrDenisp

Negative 174 pIm working on a singlepage, scrolling site broken up into five sections each with a simple, tiled background. For the sake of taller screens, Im calculating viewport height and then adding a minheight to the sections like sop  precodesection.cssminheight viewportHeight  px codepre  pIf I want the standard padding top and bottom to be 100px, I can set that in CSS and subtract 200 from the minheight function above, but what Id like to do, instead, is check if the height of each section is less than viewport height minus 200px the standard padding and if it is which means it will have a lot of extra space beneath it, conditionally apply padding that is half of viewport height minus the height of the section. Heres what Im trying to describe, but youll have to excuse my jQuery ineptitudep  precode.hometop,.homemenu,.homegallery,.homepress,.homeinfo.eachfunction     ifthis.height lt viewportHeight  200          this.csspadding viewportHeight  this.height2  px   0 px      else          this.csspadding 100  px   0 px       codepre  pIf, for example, the viewport were 1000px tall and a particular section is only 250px, then the padding would be 1000  height of content2 or padding 350px 0. Any tall section that doesnt match this criteria would just get padding 100px 0.p  pNot sure if this makes sense, but, Im, essentially, just trying to vertically center dynamic height content within the sections while setting a minimum height so that even the shortest sections background still fits the entire height of a visitors screen.

Negative 174 pIm trying to connect to a oracle webmethods web service which takes an xml file as a query string. The query string is very long, sometimes around 400K chars. WebClient, HttpWebRequest etc. does not support such long query strings. Does it have any alternative  Ive no control over the design of the Web services and are merely consumers like a few others.  Interesting thing is that if I copy paste the entire data on firefox address bar it goes through and I received acknowledgements also that the entire file content is received at the other end.p

Im not quite sure why this is occurring, although I believe its because Powershell is just rewriting the entirety of the .csv each time it creates it. p

Negative 174 pI cannot seem to find a way to call a function on the parent scope from within a directive without using isolated scope.  I know that if I use isolated scope I can just use amp in the isolated to access the function on the parent scope, but using isolated scope when it isnt necessary has consequences.  Consider the following htmlp  precodeltbutton nghidehideButton confirmAre you sure confirmactiondoItgtDo Itltbuttongt codepre  pIn simple this example, I want to show a javascript confirm dialog and only call doIt if they click ok in the confirm dialog.  This is simple using an isolated scope.  The directive would look like thisp  precode.directiveconfirm, function       return          restrict A,         scope              confirm ,             confirmAction amp         ,         link function scope, element, attrs              element.bindclick, function e                  if confirmscope.confirm                      scope.confirmAction                                              codepre  pstrongBut the problem is, because Im using isolated scope, nghide in the example above no longer executes against the parent scopestrong, but rather in the isolated scope since using an isolated scope on any directive causes all directives on that element to use the isolated scope.  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjmcooperpXej2Here is a jsFiddlea of the above example where nghide is not working.   Note that in this fiddle, the button should hide when you type yes in the input box.p  pThe alternative would be to strongNOT use an isolated scopestrong, which actually is what I really want here since there is no need for this directives scope to be isolated.  The only problem I have is, stronghow do I call a method on the parent scope if I dont pass it in on on isolated scopestrong  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjmcooperx5BwGHere is a jsfiddlea where I am NOT using isolated scope and the nghide is working fine, but, of course, the call to confirmAction doesnt work and I dont know how to make it work.p  pstrongPlease note, the answer I am really looking for is how to call functions on the outer scope WITHOUT using an isolated scope.strong  And I am not interested in making this confirm dialog work in another way, because the point of this question is to figure out how to make calls to the outer scope and still be able to have other directives work against the parent scope.p  pstrongAlternatively, I would be interested to hear of solutions that use an isolated scope if other directives will still work against the parent scopestrong, but I dont think this is possible.p

Negative 174 pI want to bring back a result set that returns the beginning effective date and the end effective date for an id with multiple supplier changes. To do this, I am looking at a transaction table that records the id, the suppliers id and the date the transaction occurred. In cases where the id has switched suppliers, I want to retire the old association and record the new association. My intent is to insert a new row with the latest switch date as the beginning effective date and a null as the end effective date.  To complete the event, I want to update the last previous row with the end effective date populated with the latest switch date.

Negative 174 pstrongWhat I dostrongp  pWhen writing shared libraries for Linux, I tend to pay attention to relocations, symbol visibility, GOTPLT etc.p  pWhen applicable, I am trying to avoid calling PLT stubs when functions from the same library call each other. For example, lets say a shared object provides two public functions  codefoocode and codebarcode either of those can be called by user. The codebarcode function, however, also calls codefoocode. So what I do in this case is thisp  ol liDefine codefoocode and codebarcode functions that have private visibility.li liDefine codefoocode and codebarcode weak aliases for codefoocode and codebarcode respectively.li ol  pThat way, the code in shared object never uses weak symbols. It only invokes local functions, directly. For example, when codebarcode is invoked, it calls codefoocode directly.p  pBut users are not aware of codecode functions and always use corresponding weak aliases.p  pstrongHow I do itstrongp  pIn Linux, this is achieved by using the following constructp  precodeextern typeof NAME NAME attributeweak, aliasNAME codepre  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pUnfortunately, this does not work for OS X. I have no deep knowledge of OS X or its binary formats, so I poked around a bit and found a few examples of weak functions like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6009321weaksymbollinkonmacosxthis onea, but those dont quite do the same as you can have a weak symbol, but not a weak symbol that is an alias for DSOs local function.p  pstrongPossible solution...strongp  pFor now, I have just disabled this feature that is implemented using macros so that all symbols are global and have default visibility. The only way I can think of to achieve the same for now is to have all codefoocode functions with private visibility and have corresponding codefoocode functions with default visibility and calling their hidden counterparts.p  pstrongA better waystrongp  pThat, however, requires a good chunk of code to be changed. Therefore I would prefer not to go there unless there is really no other way.p  pSo what is the closes OS X alternative or the easiest way to get the same semanticsbehaviorp

And best of all, theyre now available a hrefhttpdocs.scalalang.orgoverviewsmacrosparadise.htmlas a plugina in Scala 2.10.p  pThis question is about a small problem that I ran into while writing a hrefhttpmeta.plasm.usposts20130830horriblecodethis blog posta. Its on my list of stuff to look into when I can find a few minutes, but I figured Id post it here in case someone else can beat me to it, and to help other people who are running into the same question.p  pSuppose I have a list of lists of nametype pairsp  precodeval pss  List   ListnewTermNamex gt typeOf[Int], newTermNamey gt typeOf[Char],   ListnewTermNamez gt typeOf[String]  codepre  pI want to turn these into a tree that looks like thisp  precodedef foox Int, y Charz String   codepre  pThe following works just finep  precodeqdef barpss.head.head.1 pss.head.head.2   codepre  pThat is, it builds the following treep  precodedef barx Int   codepre  pWhich suggests that I should be able to write something like thisp  precodeval quoted  pss.map.map  case n, t gt qn t   qdef foo..quoted.mapps gt qps  1 codepre  pOr a little more simply, with multiple parameters in a single parameter listp  precodeqdef baz..quoted.head   codepre  pNeither worksI get errors like thisp  precodeltconsolegt28 error type mismatch  found    List[c.universe.Typed]  required List[c.universe.ValDef]            qdef baz..quoted.head                                    codepre  pFair enoughI can see how it would look to the quasiquoter like Im building typed expressions rather than defining parameters in codequotedcode. None of the obvious things I could think to try worked adding code code, explicitly typing the quasiquote as a codeValDefcode, etc..p  pI know that I can build the parameter definitions manuallyp  precodeval valDefs  pss.map   .map      case n, t gt ValDefModifiersFlag.PARAM, n, TypeTreet, EmptyTree     codepre  pAnd now the codebazcode version with one parameter list worksp  precodeqdef baz..valDefs.head   codepre  pBut not the codefoocode version the one with multiple parameter lists.p  pSo there are two questions here. First, how can I use quasiquotes to turn a nametype pair into a parameter codeValDefcode outside of the context of a quoted parameter list And second, how can I turn a list of lists of parameter definitions into multiple parameter listsp  pIts easy enough to fall back to manual AST construction for the whole damn thing see a hrefhttpmeta.plasm.usposts20130830horriblecodemy posta for an example, but Id like to be able to use quasiquotes instead.p

Negative 174 pI am writing a scheduler component and I was planning to use Quartz.net.  My requirements arep  ol liHave the scheduler running 24x7 stoppingfailing is acceptable, it would just need to start againli liBe able to see what jobstriggers are scheduled via a web pageli liBe able to add new jobstriggers via a web pageli ol  pbr Since I need a scheduler running constantly, I planned to have a Windows service.  Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any way to have the web pages interact with the scheduler running in the Windows service.  I attempted to retrieve an instance with the following code put together from examples by a hrefhttpgeekswithblogs.netTarunAroraarchive20130119quartz.netwindowsserviceonserverimportantconfigurationstepstoremember.aspx relnofollowTuran Aroraap  precode        NameValueCollection properties  new NameValueCollection         properties[quartz.scheduler.instanceName]  ServerScheduler           set thread pool info         properties[quartz.threadPool.threadCount]  0           set remoting expoter         properties[quartz.scheduler.proxy]  true         properties[quartz.scheduler.proxy.address]  tcplocalhost555QuartzScheduler           get a reference to the scheduler         ISchedulerFactory sf  new StdSchedulerFactoryproperties         IScheduler sched  sf.GetScheduler codepre  pbr Going this route gives me an error saying  Scheduler with name ServerScheduler already exists.  ServerScheduler is the default scheduler name.  After some reading, it appears that the solution is to implement a singleton pattern to instanciate and return this instance throughout the lifecycle of the scheduler.p  pThis does not seem like the ideal solution because I wanted two piecesa scheduler Windows service and a web site.  Clearly the web site should not own the scheduler because for one thing it may or may not be in use 24x7 and I need the scheduled jobs to be able to execute 24x7.  Second, I dont think I want my web site communicating back to a Windows service to get a reference to the scheduler to get this information.p  pI believe I am misunderstanding the architecture using Quartz.net in this situation.  But, if I am correct, maybe the solution is to maintain a relational data store that Quartz.net can read to get its jobs, and the web site can also read to see what is executing.  I want a relational data store to persist the jobs and triggers anyway, so maybe this is the best means of providing the data between the two applicationsp

I am implementing this in almost the exact same way, except that I use trackball controls for my camera controls. p  pThe problem is that the system gives both false positives and false negatives. I have tried drawing the lines that come from this, and it seems that the lines are always going in unanticipated directions toward a similar destination. p  precodefunction testfunctionevent        I devide by 3.5 and 2 respectively, because I do this with the actual      rendering window so that it doesnt take up the entire screen.

Negative 174 pI am trying to run a Binoinformatics program, DistMap on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x8664. I am getting the error codeNo such file or directorycode. But the file do exist in the required location.  I have used this program before and it ran perfectly fine. Yesterday I installed virtualenvburrito for some other program, Seal. Since then I havent been able to run DistMap.p  pI know there have been many posts regarding this error all over the internet. But the solution seems to be the same for all the posts. p  precodesudo aptget install ia32libs codepre  pThis solution is for running 32bit application on 64bit machines. But since Distmap worked before without any problem I dont think that is the problem. Still, I installed ia32libs just for the sake of it but no use. p  pI am sure the problem is virtualenvburrito. So I uninstalled it from my machine Deleted .virtualenv and .virtualburrito folders. Since thats the only way i found for uninstalling virtualenvburrito on the internet. Still my application is not running.p  pHow can I bring my system to default as in to the previous state of virtualenvburrito installationp  pI hope I will get some good suggestions. I have been struggling for sometime now.p  pThanks.p

Negative 174 pWhen using VS2013 and creating a new web project MVC5  .net 4.5  EF6 the default project template comes with a standard AccountController that implements the action Manage. From what I can tell, theres no viewmodel explicitly passed to the Manage view indeed, the view itself doesnt have a strongly typed model.p  pThe thing is inside the Manage view is the following line  p  precodeHtml.PartialChangePasswordPartial codepre  pWhen looking at that particular view, it shows a strongly typed viewmodel as  p  precodemodel MyProject.Models.ManageUserViewModel codepre  pYet nowhere in the project can I find this viewmodel being populated or sent to that partial view. Can someone tell me WHERE the view is getting this viewmodel from and where the viewmodel gets constructedp  pThe reason is I am trying to modify the Manage view to take my own viewmodel, and then want to pass a property of that viewmodel to the ChangePasswordPartial, so it looks something like this  p  precodepublic ActionResult Manage      CustomViewModel viewModel  bLogic.CreateViewModel     viewModel.ChangePasswordViewModel  bLogic.CreatePasswordViewModel     return ViewviewModel  codepre  pAnd then in my Manage view, have  p  precodeHtml.PartialChangePasswordPartial, Model.ChangePasswordViewModel codepre

Negative 174 pThis is a slightly updated issue of a previous problem that was solved until IE8 got in the way. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19940130makescolumnssameheightwithonecolumnhavingnestedboxesMakes columns same height with one column having nested boxesap  pThe aim is to have 2 columns, one simply filled with text while the other contains three coloured boxes of equal height 33.33 that contain a responsive image inside each. These images need to sit centre of their parent boxes. The three boxes then add up to the same height as the text column. The overall size of the container cant be a fixed height unfortunately as the site is responsive and the amount of text may change so I need the height of the two columns to be flexible.p  pThe previous post fixed the column and box height issue with display inline, however I forgot to mention that I needed it also to work in IE8. In IE8 the column containing the coloured boxes doesnt seem to want to go to 100 height of the text column. And now the images also dont want to align center vertically and horizontally in any browser. p  pI have left my attempts to do this out of the code here as it was just messy and achieved nothing.

However to teach Haskell, that codeSortBinTreecode is an instance of codeFunctorcode type class we have to write something likep  precodeinstance Functor SortBinTree where   fmap g tree  ... codepre  pThe problem here is that we have to deal with codeg  agtbcode, where codebcode is not necessarily an instance of codeOrdcode type class.

Negative 174 pThis may seem similar to other questions, but I have been looking for a while now and havent found a solution that works in my particular case.p  pMy apps BroadcastReceiver currently acquires a full wakelock, disables the keyguard, then starts another activity previously chosen by the user another app, a shortcut intent, etc. The issue I have run into is when I try to reenable the keyguard I believe the wakelock gets released, but I will make sure of that at another time.p  pSince another activity is called, I cant use the Window flags, so I have been trying to use KeyguardManager.KeyguardLock to disable and enable. Also, since I have no control over what the user does in the other app, I would like to reenable the keyguard the next time the screen is turned off. I understand that a regular BroadcastReceiver for this wont work, so I have been trying to implement a Service to take care of it, and thats where Im having some trouble.p  pCurrently, I start the Service when the first BroadcastReceiver is triggered, I have the Service register another BroadcastReceiver for ACTIONSCREENOFF in OnCreate, and have ScreenOffReceiver call the Services onStartCommand which should reenable the keyguard. I have a boolean in onStartCommand to know which BroadcastReceiver called it.p  pRight now, the keyguard either doesnt reenable, or reenables too quickly before the screen turns off.

Negative 174 pI am working on a project where I have source files I can edit .cpp, .h and object files that I cannot .obj. I am trying to add a variable to one of the source files classes. It compiles and links fine, but it causes a random crash somewhere in the applications life cycle.p  pstrongMy question is this Is there any way I can add member variables to a class residing within a source file being linked to and used by OBJ files without recompiling the OBJ filesstrongp  pI understand that its entirely possible I am misunderstanding what the actual issue is, but this is my best guess as Ive encountered it before and would appreciate answers in response to my question. That is of course unless you are absolutely sure my issue is something else.p  pHere is some background I am working with another programmers code. They have set up multiple singletons used everywhere in the code base. I am trying to decouple a particular group of systems from all the singletons using messages so that I can manage, modify, and build upon the systems more easily. Upon adding a variable to one of the singletons, it crashes the application in the same place every time of which I cannot see the source code of. Depending upon what type of variable I add, that crash will happen at some different point in the application. I have considered that there is a buffer overflow somewhere in the code base, but I do not have the time to deal with that issue and am looking at other more concrete possible causes first.p  pOf course the simple solution would be to have the programmer who is dishing out the OBJ files recompile them with my new variable added which theyve had to do once before, but I am still working out the best way to decouple the systems, and the turnaround of doing and undoing that would be too time consuming due to the other programmer working an opposite schedule of mine.p  pI would have posted some source code or debug call stacks if they were relevant, but they arent. The issue is exactly as stated. I added a variable to a class. It now crashes the program in some random OBJ files routine.p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 174 pThis question is only indirectly connected with a realworld problem, and is more out of interest. I have no real knowledge of how current realworld hash algorithms work internally.p  pI do know that typical hash computations and CRC computations etc work incrementally, updating some state strikefor each byteword in turnstrike [it turns out that the algorithms work a block at a time, though the interfaces often handle that automatically]. So a partially complete hash computation can be resumed later  store that state, then reload it and continue where you left off. There are questions about this on SO already, but they seem to all to relate to particular libraries.p  pFrom ancient knowledge of CRC16 yes, really  due to obsolete file formats, I have the impression that the CRC value itself is all the state you need to store to resume the calculation. Obviously implementations can be written in strange ways, but in principle the CRC16 of the content of the part of the file seen so far is complete state needed to resume the computation from that point.p  pIs that true of all the common hash computations used now Particularly MD5, SHA1 and SHA256. Or must some other additional or alternative state be stored in order to resume the computationp  pObviously the position to resume from in the file is needed, but in addition to that, what precise state do you need to store in order to resume a hash computation using common hash functions.p  pFor extra bonus credit  how would I access that state using Crypto in C a link or reference to the correct section of the documentation might be very helpful.p  pIm tagging this as algorithm because thats the focus here  the requirements that arise from the realworld algorithms, not the implementations for any particular language or library.p

One of the librarys methods accepts an codeInputStreamcode to load various data.p  pDue to the lack of documentation, its not clear whether or not the method closes the stream once its done with it, so one possible solution might be to wrap the call in a trywithresource, just to be on the safe side.p  pUnfortunately, the Java specification makes as far as I can tell no mention of what happens if a resource is manually closed inside a trywithresource.

Negative 174 pI have one class that needs to be a singletonp  precodeprivate static StationsFile instance private Context ctx  protected StationsFileContext ctx     this.ctx  ctx      load  public static synchronized StationsFile getInstanceContext ctx     ifinstance  null         Log.dStationsFile, set instance   StationsFile.class.hashCode         instance  new StationsFilectx         Log.dStationsFile, instance set   instance.hashCode          return instance  protected static StationsFile getInstance     return getInstancenull   private void load     ifexternalStorageIsReadable          Loads from sd file     else         loadDefaults        private void loadDefaults     ifthis.ctx  null          Load from raw file in raws folder I need a context to access Resources     else          Hardcoded default here       codepre  pNow, as this method is synchronized and its static, its supposed to be called only once at a time. When I run this in my device Android 4.4 theres no problem in my log i get set instance  instance set, but when I run it for the first time and only the first time after installing in a Android 2.2 Virtual Device or everytime in a Android 4.4 Virtual Device, I get in my log set instance  set instance  instance set  instance set, along with a crash because of this.p  pSo it looks like when the start is slow it crashes. To me it looks like the synchronized keyword just doesnt work.p  pThis method gets called from 2 different threads at the very start of the app. One thread downloads and parses the file from the internet, so it gets updated, and the other thread main thread just reads it. I dont need one to happen before the other, because if its not loaded from internet it just reads it from the internal memory.p  pIs it a bug from the virtual devices I mean, as its synchronized and as far as I understood this cant be called twice at the same time. How can I fix thisp  pEdit refractoring my class and making it follow the singleton pattern magically fixed it. Before I had public static methods that accessed getInstance so I dont have to put getInstance everywhere I want to call this class. Eventhough, Im going to rollback my code to find out what was the problem Im using a git repo.p  pEdit2 Using the hashcodes, i get the log set instance 1139286928  set instance 1139286928  instance set 1139224312  instance set 1139287568p  pEdit3 Found the bug. The problem was that the method loadDefaults when he loaded the file in the Resourcers folder, he parsed that file by using getInstance again calling a loadFromString method I had. I thought it were two different threads, but it was the same one, hence why synchronized didnt have any effect on it.p

Negative 174 pIve got a user interface that looks pretty much like iTunes.  For purposes of encapsulation, the top area and the main table view are in separate classes with separate nibs.  I want to bind the search field from the top view controller to the tableview in the bottom view controller.  Ive arranged it so there are properties to store the NSArrayController in both classes.  The array controller is an array of dictionaries, and the dictionaries have a searchkeywords key that I want to use to filter the tableview.p  pIs it possible to set up the search stuff in Interface Builder even though its in a separate nib  I cant figure out what to put in the various boxes.p  pIf its not possible with IB, I assume its possible in code, since there is a view controller with references to both of the subview controllers and I can get at the search field, table view and array controller objects through properties on the two classes.p  pHow do I set it up  IB would be best, if its possible.p

This seems to be working because when I output the array to the screen I can see my events and they look properly formatted, like thisp  precode    [eventData] gt Array              [0] gt Array                              [title] gt 0930 AM Hearing950 Boundary Rd, South Glengarry PC540 H559588Council Chambers  6 Oak St, Lancaster                 [start] gt 20140429                       [1] gt Array                              [title] gt 0930 AM Hearing612 Park St, Brockville PC340 H559597Council Chambers  1 King St W., Brockville                 [start] gt 20140430                       [2] gt Array                              [title] gt 0930 AM Hearing1340 Kingston Rd, Pickering PC430 H558975Council Chambers, One The Esplanade, Pickering                 [start] gt 20140401                    codepre  pIn addition to building the codejsonarraycode, my sample code also builds a string called codeeventStringcode which also looks like it could be used as the event source for the calendar.

Negative 174 pIve just updated some things on eclipse ADT and I created a new project.p  pIve seen that in the place where you can set the Main Activitys and main layouts names, now there is another place to set a fragments name.p  pWhen finishing creating the project, in the layout folder now appears the main layout and a framgent layout.p  pAlso, the codemainActivitycode extends codeActionBarActivitycode, makes a fragment transaction in the onCreate method, and implements the codePlaceholderFragmentcode class.p  pIs there a place where these changes are explained or could someone explain how these modifications affect to codingp  pSorry If this is stupid question, but Im learning about this and I would like to know how theses changes affect.p

Are there any restrictions on the callbackfunc or somewhere to make myfunc asynchronouspli lipSo at least the childprocess.exec is asynchronous with a callback anonymous function as argument. Here I pass sleep 10 as the first argument, to call the OSs sleep command and wait for 10 seconds. It wont block the whole node process, i.e. any other request sent to another request handler wont be blocked as long as 10 seconds by the doIt handler. However, if immediately another request is sent to the server and should be handled by the same doIt handler, will it have to wait till the previous doIt request endspli lipIf I use the sleeping10 function call commented out to replace the sleep 10, I found it does block other requests till 10 seconds after.

Negative 174 pIn android, I have an activity A and activity B. Activity A is my home screen, and from there I navigate to activity B. Activity B spawns off an async task to make network calls, and when the task returns, it calls a method in activity B to update the value of some variable.p  pNow the problem is, when I press the back or up button to go back from B to A strongbeforestrong the async task returns, I get a null pointer exception. My thinking is that the activity B is destroyed when back is pressed, so the program cant find the variable to update.p  pHow do I deal with this Ive tried using broadcast calls, so activity B would register for a broadcast that is called by the async task when it returns. This does solve the problem, but introduces another one  when I put the phone to sleep by doing a quick press of the power button, no broadcast gets received since I have to unregister broadcasts during onPause of activity B.p  pHow would you solve this problem How do I deal with returning an async tasks result to an activity that may be destroyed at any timep

But this function uses flash access functions say emblockWrite...em, emblockErase...em that are by default put on flash while compiling and flashing.p  pAdding eminlineem to function declaration and definition does not help with getting the goal, gcc and optimization options that Im using simply ignore eminlineem and does not expand this function inline.p  pOne of the option I can see is to make these functions nested inside emreprogramem but they might be part of the library and used from other places as well.p  pWhat are the other options except from unwinding them in place manually of course p  pEDIT ok, I can see that I have possibly been misunderstood.p  pThe question is not about how to actually move the code and execute from RAM but rather how to make functions used by this function to be moved as well. The first idea was changing this helper functions to eminlineem but the gcc ignored this directive while optimizing. If I only move emreprogramem function to RAM it will call the helper function from flash anyway.p
Negative 174 pI have two self hosted services running on the same network. The first is sampling an excel sheet or other sources, but for the moment this is the one Im using to test and sending updates to a subscribed client. The second connects as a client to instances of the first client, optionally evaluates some formula on these inputs and the broadcasts the originals or the results as updates to a subscribed client in the same manner as the first. All of this is happening over a tcp binding.p  pMy problem is occuring when the second service attempts to subscribe to two of the first services feeds at once, as it would do if a new calculation is using two or more for the first time. I keep getting TimeoutExceptions which appear to be occuring when the second feed is subscribed to. I put a breakpoint in the called method on the first server and stepping through it, it is able to fully complete and return true back up the call stack, which indicates that the problem might be some annoying intricacy of WCFp  pThe first service is running on port 8081 and this is the method that gets calledp  precodepublic virtual bool Subscribeint fid      try              if fid gt 1 ampamp fieldNames.LeftContainsfid                      String sessionID  OperationContext.Current.SessionId             ActionltObject, IUpdategt toSub  MakeSendOperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannelltISubClientgt, sessionIDMake a callback to the clients callback method to send the updates             if callbackList.ContainsKeyfid                 callbackList.Addfid, new DictionaryltString, ActionltObject, IUpdategtgt             callbackList[fid][sessionID]  toSubadd the callback method to the list of callback methods to call when this feed is updated             String field  GetItemfidget the current stored value of that field             CheckChangedfid, fieldadd or update field, usually returns a bool if the value has changed but also updates the last value reference, used here to ensure there is a value to send             FireOnetoSub, this, MakeUpdatefid, fieldsends an update so the subscribing service will have a first value             return true                  return false          catch Exception e              Logereport any errors before returning a failure         return false       codepre  pThe second service is running on port 8082 and is failing in this methodp  precodepublic int AddCalculationstring name, string input      try              Calculation calc         try                      calc  new CalculationfieldNames, input, namePerform slow creation before locking  better wasted one thread than several blocked ones                  catch FormatException e                      throw Fault.MakeCalculationFaulte.Message                  lock calculations                      int id  nextID             foreach int fid in calc.Dependencies                              if calculations.ContainsKeyfid                                      lock fieldTracker                                              DataRow row  fieldTracker.Rows.Findfid                         int uses  introw[Uses]  1update uses of that feed                         try                                                      if uses  1if this is the first use of this field                                 SubServiceClient service  services[introw[ServiceID]]get the stored connection as client to that service                                 service.Subscribeintrow[ServiceField]Failing here, but only on second call and not if subscribed to each seperately                                                                               catch TimeoutException e                                                      Loge                             throw Fault.MakeOperationFaultFaultType.NoItemFound, Service could not be foundcant be caught, if this timed out then outer connection timed out                                                  fieldTracker.Rows.Findfid[Uses]  uses                                                                return id                   catch FormatException f              Logf.Message         throw Fault.MakeOperationFaultFaultType.InvalidInput, f.Message       codepre  pThe ports these are on could change but are never shared.

On the client, we rebuild this into more traditional json objects before other processing occurs. egp  precodeattrNames[foo,bar],values[1,2,3,4,...] gt [foo1,bar2,foo3,bar4,...] codepre  pThe code for doing this looks a little like thisp  precodefunction toObjectArrayattrNames, values     var ret  []     var index  0     var numAttrNames  attrNames.length     var numValues  values.length     whileindex lt numValues         var obj           forvar a  0 a lt numAttrNames a             obj[attrNames[a]]  values[index]                  ret.pushobj          return ret  codepre  pGiven that the attributes may change depending on the customer data, is there a way to do this translation that takes advantage of hidden classes in modern javascript engines like V8 I have done some micro benchmarks similar to our use case  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netN6CrK1httpjsfiddle.netN6CrK1a  where working with json such that hidden classes are used is orders of magnitude faster than building the objects as above. I can get some of this boost using eval to create objects, but this feels ugly This is demonstrated in the js fiddle. Is there a better way Perhaps using some variant of Object.create, or something like itp

Negative 174 pIm looking for a way to recursively expand tree nodes. The tree has NOT been loaded to its fullest. We only load one level of depth every time. So if my path has 3 levels of depth I want to load the first, then get the nodeID of the level 2 node I want to expand and expand it, then get the 3rd etc. However when a node is expanded there is an AJAX call from the proxy to fetch the data of the nodes childs. Since this call is asynchronous the program itself tries to move forward with expanding the next level node. However this one hasnt been loaded yet due to ajax delay and I get a node undefined error. I have been searching for 1 day now on how to solve this but nothing has helped.

Negative 174 pI am creating an auction website. Here people can look for items and place bets on them. In the user account area I wish to have a list showing all the items where the user has placed a bid on. p  pOfcourse each item can have more than one bet from different users so I only wish to show the one with the highest amount of money.

As you can see user me has placed 2 bid, once on item 1 and once on item 2.

Negative 174 pConsider I use a type codeXcode in my java compilation unit from package codefoo.barcode and codeXcode is not defined in the compilation unit itself nor is it directly imported. How does a java compiler resolve codeXcode now efficiently There are a few possibilities where codeXcode could residep  ol licodeXcode might be imported via a star import codea.b.codeli licodeXcode might reside in the same package as the compilation unitli licodeXcode might be a language type, i.e. reside in codejava.langcodeli ol  pThe problem I see is especially 2.. Since codeXcode might be a packageprivate type, it is not even required that codeXcode resides in a compilation unit that is named codeX.javacode. Thus, the compiler must look into all entries of the class path and search for any classes in a package codefoo.barcode, it then must read emeveryem class that is in package codefoo.barcode to check whether codeXcode is included.p  pThat sounds very expensive. Especially when I compile only a single file, the compiler has to read dozens of class files only to find a type codeXcode. If I use a lot of star imports, this procedure has to be repeated for a lot of types although class files wont be read twice, of course.p  pSo is it advisable to import also types from the same package to speed up the compilation process Or is there a faster method for resolving an unimported type codeXcode which I was not able to findp

Negative 174 pTLDR See the last paragraph of this question.p  pIm a Computer Science student trying to finish the text of my master thesis about creating a transpiler case study.p  pNow for this master thesis, a part of my text is about comparing the languages involved. One of the languages is C.p  pNow Im trying to explain the difference in importinclude semantics and the historical reason why C did it that way. I know how it works in CC, so I dont really need a technical explanation.p  pResearching extensively on Google and Stackoverflow I came up with several stackoverflow explanations and other references on this topicp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2632601whyareforwarddeclarationsnecessary26326762632676Why are forward declarations necessaryap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4757565cforwarddeclarationC  Forward declarationap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1305947whydoescneedaseparateheaderfileWhy does C need a separate header fileap  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIncludedirective relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIncludedirectiveap  pa hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comforumarticles10627 relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comforumarticles10627ap  pa hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions180904areheaderfilesactuallygoodhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions180904areheaderfilesactuallygoodap  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOnepasscompiler relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOnepasscompilerap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions333889whyhaveheaderfilesandcppfilesincWhy have header files and .cpp files in Cap  pAnd last but not least the book Design and Evolution of C 1994 of Bjarne Stroustrup page 34  35.p  pIf I understand correctly this way of doing importsincludes came from C and came to be because of the following reasonsp  ul lipComputers were not as fast so a One pass compiler was preferable. The only way this was possible is by enforcing the declaration before use idiom. This is because C and C are programming languages that have a contextsensitive grammar they need the right symbols to be defined in the symbol table in order to disambiguate some of the rules. This is opposed to modern compilers nowadays a first pass is usually done to construct the symbol table and sometimes in case the language has a contextfree grammar the symbol table is not required in the parsing stage because there are no ambiguities to resolve.pli lipMemory was very limited and expensive in those days. Therefore it was not feasible to store a whole symbol table in memory in most computers. Thats why C let programmers forward declare the function prototypes and global variables they actually needed. Headers were created to enable developers to keep those declarations centralized so they could easily be reused across modules that required those symbols.pli lipHeader files were a useful way to abstract interface from implementationpli lipC tried to establish backwards compatibility with software and softwarelibraries written in C. More importantly they actually used to transpile to C CFront and then using a C Compiler to compile the code into machine code. This also enabled them to compile to a lot of different platforms right from the start, as each of those platforms already had a C compiler and C linker.pli ul  pThe above was an illustration of what I discovered by searching first  The problem is I cant find a suitable reference to the historical reasons for this include strategy, aside from here on Stackoverflow. And I highly doubt my university will be happy with a stackoverflow link. The closest Ive come is the Design and Evolution of C reference, but it doesnt mention the hardware limitations being a reason for the include strategy. I think thats to be expected because the design of the feature came from C. Problem is that I didnt find any good source yet that describes this design decision in C, preferably with the hardware limitations in mind.p  pCan anyone point me in the good directionp  pThanksp

Negative 174 pIm about to implement AODV on ARM board SabreLite and Im facing some problems.p  pSo, I use the latest version of AODV located here sourceforge.netprojectsaodvuu. Ive follow the instruction given in README file but at the end, i get the errorp  pstrongkaodvmod.c2227 fatal error linuxversion.h No such file or directory  include strongp  pSince the board use  3.0.35 kernel version, i download it and I just change the kernel directory in Makefile. And, it should normally worked based on the instruction a hrefhttpw3.antd.nist.govwctgaodvkernelkaodvarm.html relnofollowhttpw3.antd.nist.govwctgaodvkernelkaodvarm.htmla. The above error suggests that i dont have the version.h but I checked and I have all of linux header files installed, so it cant be that.p  pOn the step number 6 of the tutorial README file, i did not compile the kernel 3.0.35 because im pretty positive that it has the proper netfilter support for AODVUU as it is a kernel young version.  It is actually a configuration suggestion on kernel 2.4 and 2.6 but i think i should not obliged to do that here p  ul liWhat can be the solution of this li liDo i really need to compile this kernel version 3.0.35 before keep going li liDo i have to change the AODV code, and if so, which files do i have to modify li ul  pThanks in advance p  hr  pThanks for your response, but unfortunately, ive already done that.

Negative 174 pI would like to cast an int value as nullable enum used a generic function.  I thought it would be easy, especially with all the with all the SO about the enum  int casting.  The closest question Ive found is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10387095castinttogenericenumincsharpthis onea, but unfortunately, it doesnt handle the nullable enums.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5199419csharpcastobjectoftypeinttonullableenumThis questiona solve the Nullable enums casting question but not with the generic.p  pHeres a simplified example of what Im trying to dop  precode    public enum SouthParkCharacters      Stan  0,     Kyle  1,     Eric  2,     Kenny  3   public static T CastNullableEnumltTgtint value      return Tobjectintvalue.Value    public static T SomeFunctionltTgtthis int anyEnumValue          SouthParkCharacters spc  SouthParkCharacters.Kenny          spc  CastNullableEnumltSouthParkCharactersgt3 I am working         spc  CastNullableEnumltSouthParkCharactersgt3 Raise error Specified cast is not valid.

Negative 174 pI have a C.NET 4.0 application that receives and parses some data from a network connection.  One particular piece of data that I need to parse is a UInt16 value that represents a set of flags.  Ive defined an enum that represents these flags like thisp  precodepublic enum Fields      None  0,     FirstFlag  1,     SecondFlag  2,     ThirdFlag  4,     FourthFlag  8,     FifthFlag  16,     SixthFlag  32,     SeventhFlag  64,     EighthFlag  128  codepre  pI going to try to use bitwise operators on this UInt16 value to determine which flags it indicated had been set.  But then I ran across Enum.HasFlag method and at first glance, that seemed like it would be easier than bitwise operations.  Ive been trying to use the following method to determine which flags are set in the UInt16 valuep  precodepublic static void CheckForSetFieldsFields value      if value.HasFlagFields.None              System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineNo fields are set          else              if value.HasFlagFields.FirstFlag                      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineFirst flag is set.                  if value.HasFlagFields.SecondFlag                      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineSecond flag is set.                    etc., etc.          if value.HasFlagFields.EighthFlag                      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineEighth flag is set.                codepre  pThis method obviously takes a parameter of type Fields my enum but Im working with a UInt16 value that was sent to me.  I assume that I need to convert the UInt16 into an instance of the Fields enum but Im not sure how to do that.  It doesnt seem to be as simple as just casting it which doesnt give me an error but also doesnt return the expected results, either.  Is it possible to do this using Enum.HasFlag or should I just implement the bitwise operations and be done with itp

Negative 174 pIm pretty new to java, but Im trying to make a simulation of the finger game, Sticks, using my limited knowledge. This may not be the neatest, but if youre going to make a suggestion on me to do something, link a page explaining what that thing is, and Ill read it.p  pOk, so the issue comes up basically when I call a method to decide whos turn it is and trying to return the value for the count up to 5, but its not returning to mainp  precodepublic static int TurnCalcBBint PLH, int PRH, int BRH, int BLH, int Death      Attacking with bot Right hand     Random botAtk  new Random     ifbotAtk.nextInt2  1 ampamp PRH lt 5              PRH  BRH  PRH         JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull,Your right hand is now at   PRH         return PRH      else ifbotAtk.nextInt2  0 ampamp PLH lt 5         PLH  BRH  PLH         JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Your left hand is now at   PLH         return PLH          return Death  codepre  pDeath is there because I was getting an error telling me that I always need to return SOMETHING so Im returning a static value.p  pBasically, the problem is getting PLH player left hand or PRH player right hand to return to main. If Im not wrong, they should return as their initial variable name PL, and PR with the returned value correct If not, what can I do to fix thisp  pThe code is a lot larger than this, and this issue is happening throughout the whole program, so Im showing just 1 method and assuming theyre all the same issue the methods are almost all the same.p  pAlso, while Im typing a question already, is nextInt the best way to do a random number generator When I had it as nextInt1 it was exclusively attacking the left hand, and when I switched it to nextInt2 now its attacking both, but occasionally the code... crashes what I mean by crashes is that it generates a number outside of what the If statements are looking for. I obviously need to to generate either a 1 or a 2 or 0 and 1 if 0 counts.p

Everybody who includes codefoo.hcode only sees the anonymous forward declaration and the real layout of codestruct fooscode is only known in codefoo.ccode.p  pI started to smell something odd with the above when I tried using includewhatyouuse which uses clang. When I used it to check codefoo.ccode it informed me that codefoo.hcode should not contain the forward declaration of codestruct fooscode. I thought it was a bug in iwyu because obviously this would not be a problem for anybody else who includes codefoo.hcode.p  pAt this point let me come to my second requirement from the beginning. codefoo.ccode includes codefoo.hcode so that the compiler can make sure that every function declared in codefoo.hcode matches the implementation in codefoo.ccode. I think I need this because I ran into segmentation faults too often because the function signature of my implementation did not match the one in the header that other code used.p  pLater I tried compiling the code with clang I compile with codeWall Wextra Werrorcode and was informed thatp  precodeerror redefinition of typedef foo is a C11 feature codepre  pI dont want my code to depend on a C11 feature and I do want to be sure that the functions in the public header match the implementation. How do I solve thatp  pI see a way which is to split codefoo.hcode into codefoo.hcode and codefooprivate.hcodep  pfoo.h inclusion guards omitted for brevityp  precodestruct foos  include fooprivate.h codepre  pfooprivate.h inclusion guards omitted for brevityp  precodetypedef struct foos foo  foo foocreatevoid void foodosomethingfoo foo codepre  pAnd then I would include codefooprivate.hcode in codefoo.ccode and other code would include codefoo.hcode. This would mean that codefoo.ccode does not see the forward declaration of codefooscode anymore and thus clang and iwyu should be happy. It also means that the implementation of my functions is checked to match the header.p  pBut while this works it makes me wonder whether this is the best solution becausep  ul liit seems a waste to have one header file with only two linesli liI do not know of other projects that do it like that and looking in my usrinclude I dont see any eitherli ul  pSo what would a the solution be that fulfills the three criterea listed at the top Or is the solution I found the one to gop

Negative 174 pI am having an issue adding a photo slide show to my asp.net master page. I am working on this project for a friend of mine who needs a website built for her company. I have tried a number of different slide shows as well as coding a few from scratch using tutorials. This is not my main language so I am finding it difficult to spot exactly what is wrong and having tried all possible solutions with no success, I have decided to ask for help. p  precodelt Master

accessed, but none of the javascript files seem to be doing anything. The slider is displayed, but all the images are placed vertically one underneath each other, so I have a long line of images running vertically down the page. Sorry if the formatting is off or if there is not enough detail, this is my first post on here, I usually figure things out on my own. Thanks for the helpp  pEditp  pI removed the tilda  from the javascript paths and the java files seem to be found, When I press F12 or Ctrl  shift  j i get the following error Uncaught typeError

Negative 174 pSuppose I have a weighted undirected connected graph, each vertex has codeMcode goods and needs codeNcode goods.p  pFor some vertexes, codeM gt Ncode so that they can meet their requirement. For the other vertexes, we have to transport goods from rich vertex to them because requirement has to be satisfied.p  pHowever, transport has cost. The cost equals to the weight of the edge multiply the number of goods transported.p  pAssume the number of goods all vertexes have is bigger than the number of goods all vertexes need. I need a transport plan that can make all vertexes meet their needs with least cost.p  pAny idea on this Thanks for your timep  pUPDATEp  pTo make this problem simpler, if vertex is some place in a map, the edge between 2 vertexes is not a road between 2 place in the map, but the shortest path between these 2 place. So the graph turned into a complete graph.p  pThen there is no need to do transport between rich vertexes and between pool vertexes. We can regard this graph as bipartite graph.p

Negative 174 pI would like to know how to save a file in the current directory.

Negative 174 pI would like to link a Fortran program with an arbitrary binary file.

The compilation step works, but at execution the number 0 is printed instead of pi, so something went wrong. Im not even sure the codecommoncode is the right thing to do, and I wonder if there could be some confusion between address and value. Also, I would be interested in array data, rather than a single scalar I can do this in C too, using a pointer on val.p  pAny idea on what I should do to make this work p  pIn case its important, Im working with gcc 4.9.1 from a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsmingww64filesToolchains20targetting20Win32Personal20Buildsmingwbuilds4.9.1threadswin32dwarf relnofollowherea, on Windows 7, 32 bits.

I emcouldem do this in C, but I would prefer a pure Fortran approach if possible.p  hr  pstrongeditstrongp  pFollowing suggestion from High Performance Mark and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comtagsfortranisocbindinginfothis pagea from Stack Overflow, here is a solution for scalar datap  precodemodule binmod     use isocbinding, only cdouble     realcdouble, bindc  val end module  program forbin     use binmod     implicit none     print , val end program codepre  pAnd of course I use the C name codevalcode instead of codevalcode.p  pHowever, when doing this with an array, I still dont see how to use the symbols from codedata.ocode to declare the array in Fortran. I could write the dimensions by hand, but it does not seem very robust it would be easy to forget to update the Fortran code if I update the data.p  pHere is the output from codeobjdump t data.ocodep  precode00000000 l    d  .data  00000000 .data 00000000 g       .data  00000000 val 00000008 g       .data  00000000 binarydatabinend 00000008 g       ABS  00000000 binarydatabinsize codepre  pThe global codebinarydatabinendcode is a marker of end of data, similar to codebinarydatabinstartcode that I renamed to codevalcode, and codebinarydatabinsizecode is an absolute value. In C, it would be possible to print this latter value withp  precodeextern char binarydatabinsize ... printfdn, ampbinarydatabinsize codepre  pHowever, I dont even understand how a pointer can do the job here, even if I dont consider the warning from the compiler.

Negative 174 pIm using cooperative coevolution to solve a couple of function optimisation problems, and am having issues. p  pThe functions take N parameters, where each parameter is a number, and all the functions minimise when each and every one of the N parameters is 0. p  pMy representation of the individuals for use in cooperative coevolution is a binary string, so I can perform bitflip mutations its imperative I keep this representation. p  pDue to the fact that the functions converge when the parameters are zero, of course 1 is pretty close.

Negative 174 pI am trying to scrape several thousand files from a government website using a limited set of curl settings. In fact, I have a set of ten proxies which I would like to use in this process. I set them up in a set of ten curls which are supposed to hold the connection to the server from which I am downloading after they are used see point 1.  for demonstration purposes I am not using proxies but just two normal curl handles. Afterwards I define the multihandler codemhcode and the function codecompletegencode see point 2. which is supposed to process the multihandle and pop the subhandles after they are used. After splitting up the list of uris codeurscode into handy chunks of size 2, I am defining the downloading function codedwldercode see point 3.. In the codedwldercode each url from a chunk supplied to the function is added to a random curl and pushed into the multihandler codemhcode. After the multihandler is setup after the loop within the function it is processed with the function codecompletegencode, which downloads the files and pops out the used subhandles. With this approach I thought I could limit the number of concurrent connections which are kept alive during the process of downloading. I wanted to avoid running into a huge load of connections in codeCLOSEWAITcode which finally stop the process as a whole after a certain point of time this is a well known problem with codelibcurlcode after some research. This is the behavior you get from using the standard codeRCurlcode function codegetURIAsynchronouscode. When you proceed to point 4. you will however notice that my approach doesnt work neither The first chunk is downloaded correctly, while the second chunk is empty. Clearly the function ran out of handles and could only process the first chunk but not the second. p  pThis leads me to the question How can I modify a curl after it has been used without setting it up anew completely and thus losing the connectionp  pIn section 8.5.1 of a hrefhttpsbooks.google.frbooksidYLS9BAAAQBAJamppgPA115ampdqXML20and20Web20Technologies20for20Data20Sciences20with20RamphlenampsaXampeigOarVOTlEofpUtKCgMgEampredirescyvonepageampqpopampffalse relnofollowXML and Web Technologies for Data Sciences with Ra the authors Nolan and Lang the latter is in the development team of RCurl claim that this should work.

Negative 174 pI am running a program where stepwise, certain criteria eliminates records from tables.  However, a record could be eliminated after the 7th table or 8th so the way Ive been doing it, merging table 1 with 2, then table 2 with 3, and so on isnt very convenient.  Is there a way I can track an observation with flags  Like say, if A is in table 1 then match  1 else match  0.  And from there, identify which table A was eliminated from in this case Table 3.  I would need to track possibly multiple observations not too many, maybe 5 or 10 at a time though and they may be eliminated at different points one in Table 3, one in Table 8.p  pExamplep  pTable 1p  pPatIDp  pAp  pBp  pCp  pDp  pEp  pFp  pTable 2p  pAp  pBp  pDp  pEp  pFp  pTable 3p  pBp  pDp  pEp  pFp

Negative 174 pIm trying to do this on SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pI have a table with 4 columnsp  precodeparentid INT childid INT starttime TIME endtime TIME codepre  pYou should look at the children as subprocesses that run for the parent program. All these subprocesses are run once every day, and each child run within its given time span. I want to find the largest overlap of time intervals for each parent based on the times of its children, i.e. I want to know the longest possible overlap where all the subprocesses are running. The fact that each time span is repeated every day means that even if childs time interval spans midnight i.e. 23001000, it can overlap with a child that only runs in the morning i.e. 07000900, because even if they dont overlap on the first day, they will overlap on all subsequent days.p  pThe output should look like thisp  precodeparentid INT starttime TIME endtime TIME valid BIT codepre  pWhere codevalid  1code if an overlap was found and codevalid  0code if no overlap was found.p  pA couple of important pieces of informationp  ol liA time interval can span midnight, i.e. codestarttime  2300code and codeendtime  0300code, which is a time interval of 4 hours.li liTwo time intervals may overlap in two different places, i.e. codestarttime1  1300code, codeendtime1  0600code, codestarttime2  0400code, codeendtime2  1400code. This would give the largest overlap as 0400  0600  2 hours.li liThere may be no overlap common for the children of a given parent, in which case the out put for that parent would be codestarttime  NULLcode, codeendtime  NULLcode and codevalid  0code.li liIf a child interval spans the whole day, then codestarttime  NULLcode and codeendtime  NULLcode. This was chosen to avoid having a day as 00002400, which would slice overlaps crossing midnight in two, i.e. parent 3 below would end up having two overlaps 23002400 and 0000  00400, in stead of one 23000400.li liAn overlap is only an overlap if the time interval is shared by all the children of a parent.li liThe time span of one child can never be longer than 24 hours.li ol  pTake this examplep  precodeparentid  childid  starttime  endtime     1         1           0600     1400     1         2           1300     0900     1         3           0700     0900     2         1           1200     1700     2         2           0900     1100     3         1            NULL      NULL     3         2           2300     0400     4         1            NULL      NULL     4         2            NULL      NULL    10         1           0611     1400    10         2           0600     0900    10         3           0500     0844    11         1           1138     1700    11         2           0902     1211 codepre  pThese data would produce this result setp  precodeparentid  starttime  endtime  valid     1           0700     0900    1     2            NULL      NULL    0     3           2300     0400    1     4            NULL      NULL    1    10           0611     0844    1    11           1138     1211    1 codepre  pThe overlap for a parent is the time interval that is shared by all its children. So the overlap for parent 10 is found by finding the overlap where all 3 children share time Child 1 06111400 and 2 06000900 overlap from 0611 to 0900. This overlap time interval is then applied to child 3 05000844, which gives an overlap of 0611 to 0844, since this interval is the only interval where all 3 children share common time.p  pI hope this makes sense.p  pI can do it with a cursor, but I would really prefer to avoid cursors.

The team Im working on uses a DBAfirst approach to development ie the database is designed by DBAs and then the developers alter the code to compensate for the model changes.p  pUsing EF6, this works well, since we can just update the code using the EDMX designers update functionality. One click, we get the new classes, and were done. However, in EF7, everything is different. Theres no more designer, and were supposed to use CodeFirst, which according to some blog postings out there by the EF team, should also support DatabaseFirst code generation.p  pHowever, Im unable to figure out how to do this with the Visual Studio 2015 CTP6 in an ASP.NET 5 application. Is the tooling support there yet, or am I out of luck And is it even coming at allp  pThanksp

Negative 174 pIm relatively new to Java.  Im tinkering with a small program which uses a JFrame with a few fields to query and insert into a database.p  pI currently have a class which does nothing but creates the database connection.  From there, I have other classes which perform the SELECT or INSERT database functions.  Each of these starts by creating a new object for the database connection class.  The connection does get closed when finished.p  pBeing new to this, I just wanted to see if this was the best way to access the database, ie creating and closing a brand new connection each time a button is pressed.  It performs the task needed, but if theres a more efficient or sensible way to do this Id love to know.p  pI can provide whatever code you may need to see.  Thanksp

Negative 174 pSince there are many examples to send the queries to the Web Service e. g. MySQL using php file as the intermediator, I wonder if is it possible to write the code with objective c to do it without the php code at all. p  pIf it is possible, a piece of code would be welcome because I have no idea how to send the SQL query that way. Perhaps to use NSMutableURLRequest and NSURLConnection p  pFrameworks are not the preference.p
Negative 174 pUsually, its better if we provide image in different densities sdpi, mdpi,hdpi, xhdpi, etc. Do I need to provide the same thing if I retrieve it from the server using some kind of library Picasso, Glide, Volley, etc or should I just provide the original image and the library will convert it to the appropriate size and density to my appp  pstrongNotestrong If I provide images with different size or densities, I dont retrieve all of it. I just retrieve all the images url and just download once of them. Is it better this way, or is it better to provide one original image url and retrieve it and resize it to the appropriate sizep

Negative 174 pI have been hearing about build dependency  runtime dependency. They are quite self explanatory terms. As far as I understand, build dependency is used for components required in the compile time. For example if A has a build dependency to B, A cannot be built without B. Runtime dependency on the other hand is dynamic. If A has a runtime dependency to B, A can be built without B but cannot run without B.br This information however is too shallow. Id like to read and understand these concepts better. I have been googling but could not find a source, can you please provide me a link or right keywords to searchp

Now this is assuming that the table has already been built and those excelcsv file will always be formatted the same and will be in the same exact place every single time. Is it possible to automate this process or at least get it to point where very minimal human interference is needed. Im new to AWS so Im not exactly sure of the limits of S3 to RDS.

There is an add button in the fragment that takes the user to an screen where heshe can create a new Activity object.

Negative 174 pIm in the process of starting to develop an IOSSwift App with a Framework to share common logic with a Today Widget and I have some questions about the Bundle Identifierp  ol lipIf I choose something as emorg.whateverIwant.TestBundleIDem for the App, should whateverIwant.org really exist or is it simply a unique identifierpli lipIf I later add an a Cocoa Touch custom Framework to the project, it asks me for a Product Name TestBundleIDFramework and then it appends by default the product name to emorg.whateverIwantem without emTestBundleIDem. Instead, if I add a Target for a Today Extension it appends the Product Name TestBundleIDExtension to emorg.whateverIwant.TestBundleIDem. Given the fact that all the three parts App, Today Extension and Framework are part of the same app that Ill upload to the store, is this way of using BundleIDs correct Should also the Framework be under emorg.whateverIwant.TestBundleIDem, such as emorg.whateverIwant.TestBundleID.TestBundleIDFrameworkem as for the Today Extensionpli liIs it extremely important to chose the right Bundle ID at the beginning of the project consider that I still have no developer account, Ill pay for it as soon as I see that Im able to build the app Id like to or can it be changed without hassle later onli ol  pAn brief OT question there is a Version field for each target, what is the one that Apple looks at when determining if the uploaded bundle AppExtensionFramework has been updated to a new versionp

For example if the image is in gray scale, and a pixel has value 0.4849 while all the other pixels correspond to values below 0.001 then that pixel would probably be coloured black, or something close to black.p  pHere is an example image, the array is 28x28 and contains values between 0 and 1. p  pAll I did to plot this image was run the following codep  precodeimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt im  plt.imshowmyArray, cmapgray plt.show codepre  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comXspic.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXspic.png altenter image description hereap  pHowever, for some reason this only works if the values are between 0 and 1.

Negative 174 pSo Ive been working on compiling a static version of MySQL and a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypimysqlclient2022MySQLclient relnofollowMySQLclientpythona. Ive been completely successful up to this point where Im trying to understand a libSystem.B.dylib dependency that MySQLclientpython has. p  pTo make it clear, MySQLclientpython is a python wrapper around the MySQL C Library. This results in the need to compile MySQLclientpython before it is used. This is currently working on OS X 10.7, and my goal is to create a compiled version of MySQLclientpython that will work on multiple versions of OS X bundling libmysql is already taken care of. Right now, I am compiling MySQLclientpython perfectly fine, and it works on 10.7. However, when its testing on 10.8, it breaks. To compile MySQLclientpython, Im using python 3.5 and running p  precodepython setup.py build codepre  pThis results in two things happening. First, a mysql.o object file is compiled using a command similar to a hrefhttpsgist.github.comalexggordone55e4518524e23a1ce11 relnofollowthisa. Then, a shared object file is compiled using a hrefhttpsgist.github.comalexggordon04dc816bae6ff18bbe02 relnofollowthis scripta. To be clear, those commands are mostly generated by setup.py.p  pThe resulting build has the structurep  precode.  setup.py  build      mysql.so      MySQLdb      mysqlexceptions.py codepre  pNow, when running p  precode otool L mysql.so mysql.so usrliblibSystem.B.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 159.1.0 codepre  pIt clearly shows theres a dependency on libSystem.B.dylib. Now dependencies arent an issue in general, and this works fine on 10.7. I can import the python module and use it correctly. However, when switching to 10.11, this same module no produces ap  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt   File .MySQLdbinit.py, line 19, in ltmodulegt import mysql   ImportError dlopen.mysql.so, 2 Symbol not found      ZNSt8iosbase4InitD1Ev   Referenced from .mysql.so   Expected in flat namespace in .mysql.so codepre  pObviously, my first thought is that theres a problem with the dependency. I do believe that is the issue. To be honest though, Im not sure where to go from here. Obviously, OS X strongly discourages static linking, so I didnt look into that for long. Just to be clear once more, my goal is just to be able to use this on multiple OS X platforms 10.710.11 and this currently works on 10.7. Any ideasp
