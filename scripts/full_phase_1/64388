Positive 64388 pI am trying to implement an analyzer uppercase and index some documents after that in elasticsearch. My question is, am i following the correct procedurep  precodeImplement your analyzer containing index and type name, which would create the index if it doesnt exist  Then index the documents with the same index and type name as above during which stream of text would pass through the analyzer and then would be saved in index. codepre  pIs this the correct way to go about itp  pI indexed some documents with and without using analyzers, checked the contents of index beforeafter using emFacetsem, and they were no different.p
Positive 64388 pAt the moment Im using queries like the following with positive boosting of a term.p  precode    query          bool               must                   term   title  value word, boost 2.0                               codepre  pThis type of query is described a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchreference2.0querydsltermquery.html relnofollowherea. I would like to know if it is possible to use negative boosting of term just like the above, but instead of 2.0 a 2.0. So like thisp  precode     query          bool               must                   term   title  value word, boost 2.0                               codepre  pI couldnt find any documentation on it. It only tells the default value for boost is 1.0. And all examples use positive boosting. There is however some kind of negative boost  described a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentnotquitenot.html relnofollowherea, but that is boosting queries instead of terms.p
Positive 64388 pI am using packetbeat in afpaket traffic capturing mode, which give me about 30 CPU footprint on single core instance when I go for http and mysql monitoring only. As soon as I increase more header and cookie capture in http, CPU goes a little bit higher.p  pI am getting lots of WARN Response from unknown transaction. Ignoring warnings too, looks like packetbeat ignores already established connections communication. We are using pool of mysql connection in application, can it cause this issue p  pI am unable to find any documentation which can help me in setting up a dedicated server for packetbeat and how can I forward traffic from application servers to packetbeat instance. If I can do so then it will offload computation from application servers.p  pOn application server we are having about 100 rps including web and mysql.

Positive 64388 pIm facing the following issue. Say that you have an index in elasticsearch modeling a supermarket. You have a document for each time a customer shops something. So,p  precode    customer1, [list of bougth items], timestamp     customer2, [list of bougth items], timestamp     customer3, [list of bougth items], timestamp     customer2, [list of bougth items], timestamp codepre  pNow, it is possible that a customer come to the shop one time in his life, or he come every week, or everyday. So I record the timestamp indicating the time when he was buying something. I would like to compute the average recurring time of the customer to buy something. E.g. if a customer buys on 1sep, 7 sep and 30 sep, his average recurring time is first interval 7days second interval 23 days average recurring time 2372  15 days.p  pDo you know an aggregation that can help me to find out this statistic The problem, for me, its that I have only the timestamp of the day of buying and I havent the differences between consecutive buying.p  pThanks all.p

The information we receive is essentially a oneforone with the records in our tables, so for example a list of customers would be in our old versionp  precodeltCustsgt   ltCust ID101 LongNameLarge customer ShortNameLgCust LocSEgt   ltCust ID102 LongNameSmall customer ShortNameSmCust LocNEgt   .... ltCustsgt codepre  pHowever weve been discussing the merits of moving to a structure thats more element based, for examplep  precodeltCustsgt   ltCust ID101gt     ltLongNamegtLarge CustomerltLongNamegt     ltShortNamegtLgCustltShortNamegt     ltLocgtSEltLocgt   ltCustgt   ltCust ID102gt     ltLongNamegtSmall CustomerltLongNamegt     ltShortNamegtSmCustltShortNamegt     ltLocgtNEltLocgt   ltCustgt   .... ltCustsgt codepre  pBecause the files are so large I dont think well be using a DOM parser to try to load these into memory, nor do we have any need of locating particular items in the files.  So my question is in this case, is one form elements or attributes generally preferred over the other when youve got large amounts of data and performance demands to considerp
Negative 64388 pIn a C program, I have an abstract base class with a static Create method.  The Create method is used to create an instance of the class and store it locally for later use.

Negative 64388 pI have this weird configuration problem at work, so I thought Id give this site a try. My GoogleFu is failing me...p  pbThe situationb I need to convert our current development environment from XP 32bit to Vista 64bit . Naturally, Ive run into plenty of places in our build system where hardcoded paths were problematic e.g. codeCProgram Filescode becoming codeCProgram Files x86code. Fortunately, there is a codeProgramFilescode environment variable which maps to the proper directory based on the source process 32bit or 64bit. So I updated the build scripts with codeProgramFilescode and I was sure itd be the end of that.p  pThe build environment is called from the commandline codeCWindowsSystem32cmd.execode.p  pbThe problemb On one specific machine namely my dev machine at work, it turns out that codeCWindowsSystem32cmd.execode is actually a 32bit process, so the scripts find the codex86code version of the codeProgram Filescode directory and everything works great.p  pOn every other 64bit machine I can find including my home machine, codeCWindowsSystem32cmd.execode is the 64bit version, and the 32bit version is in codeCWindowsSysWow64cmd.execode. So the build scripts cant find anything theyre looking for and fail.p  pI understand now that the 32bit codecmd.execode should be called explicitly if thats what you need, and by default you get a 64bit codecmd.execode. Typical case of codeWORKSFORMEcode...p  pbThe question isb, what happened to the machine where this is not true Why am I getting a 32bit codecmd.execode by default on one machine but not on others In all cases I am explicitly executing codeCWindowsSystem32cmd.execode from the codeStartRuncode menu but getting different results ion one machine onlyi. All are running the same edition of Vista 64bit.p  pAny thoughts or insightp  pThanksp  p Please accept that I imusti do this, I am not at liberty to say iwhyi I am doing this. Reinstalling the OS and everything from scratch would probably work, but is surely overkill. Besides, it was hard enough convincing our IT dept to give out Vista machinesp

Negative 64388 pSuppose you have a subsystem that does some kind of work. It could be anything. Obviously, at the entry points to this subsystem there will be certain restrictions on the input. Suppose this subsystem is primarily called by a GUI. The subsystem needs to check all the input it recieves to make sure its valid. We wouldnt want to FireTheMissles if there was invalid input. The UI is also interested in the validation though, because it needs to report what went wrong. Maybe the user forgot to specify a target or targetted the missles at the launchpad itself. Of course, you can just return a null value or throw an exception, but that doesnt tell the user SPECIFICALLY what went wrong unless, of course, you write a separate exception class for each error, which Im fine with if thats the best practice. p  pOf course, even with exceptions, you have a problem. The user might want to know if input is valid BEFORE clicking the Fire Missles button. You could write a separate validation function of course IsValid doesnt really help much because it doesnt tell you what went wrong, but then youll be calling it from the button click handler and again from the FireTheMissles function I really dont know how this changed from a vague subsystem to a misslefiring program. Certainly, this isnt the end of the world, but it seems silly to call the same validation function twice in a row without anything having changed, especially if this validation function requires, say, computing the hash of a 1gb file. p  pIf the preconditions of the function are clear, the GUI can do its own input validation, but then were just duplicating the input validation logic, and a change in one might not be reflected in the other. Sure, we may add a check to the GUI to make sure the missle target is not within an allied nation, but then if we forget to copy it to the FireTheMissles routine, well accidentally blow up our allies when we switch to a console interface. p  pSo, in short, how do you achieve the followingp  ol liInput validation that tells you not just that something went wrong, but what specifically went wrong.li liThe ability to run this input validation without calling the function which relies on it.li liNo double validation.li liNo duplicate code.li ol  pAlso, and I just thought of this, but error messages should not be written in the FireTheMissles method. The GUI is responsible for picking appropriate error messages, not the code the GUI is calling.p

Negative 64388 pGiven a coordinate lat, long, I am trying to calculate a square bounding box that is a given distance e.g. 50km away from the coordinate.  So as input I have lat, long and distance and as output I would like two coordinates one being the southwest bottomleft corner and one being the northeast topright corner.  I have seen a couple of answers on here that try to address this question in Python, but I am looking for a Java implementation in particular.  p  pJust to be clear, I intend on using the algorithm on Earth only and so I dont need to accommodate a variable radius. p  pIt doesnt have to be hugely accurate 20 is fine and itll only be used to calculate bounding boxes over small distances no more than 150km.  So Im happy to sacrifice some accuracy for an efficient algorithm.  Any help is much appreciated.p  pEdit  I should have been clearer, I really am after a square, not a circle.  I understand that the distance between the center of a square and various points along the squares perimeter is not a constant value like it is with a circle.  I guess what I mean is a square where if you draw a line from the center to any one of the four points on the perimeter that results in a line perpendicular to a side of the perimeter, then those 4 lines have the same length.p

This is surprising because the first two calls to display should have initialized display I would have thought.  If lt display.reverse  is removed the output is a aa, indicating that the display instance variable is getting set by the helper method, but there is no access to it in the view.p  pIf the controller is modified so to become with the original view codep  precodeclass SampleController lt ApplicationController   def test     display   end end codepre  pThe output becomes aa aaa a a.  If I make it 2 calls to display in the controller, I get, aaa aaaa aa aa.

Negative 64388 pSorry in advance for the long post but the problem I am facing here is quite crucial for me, so here we go...p  pI have a Eclipse GWT 2.0 Web Application using the the GAE and making transactions with its datastore. On the other hand I would like to make sure that I can also deploy this web application on another infrastructure than the Google App Engine. Therefore I wanted to debug my web app using another servlet container Tomcat 6 and another datastore mySQL or MSSQL or any other, it doesnt really matter for now.p  pIn order to be able to debug an Eclipse web app with Tomcat it has to carry the emDynamic Web Projectem facet. If it doesnt then the new server that I add to Eclipse within Servers refuses to pick my GWT module in its list of supported apps. And not only GWT Web Apps dont carry it, but they dont even allow to alter the projects facets at all However, I found that adding the few relevant  tags to the .project file can make it eligible within Eclipse to allow new project facets additions. Here are the tags I usedp  precodeltnaturegtorg.eclipse.jdt.core.javanatureltnaturegt ltnaturegtcom.google.gwt.eclipse.core.gwtNatureltnaturegt ltnaturegtorg.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.natureltnaturegt ltnaturegtorg.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNatureltnaturegt ltnaturegtorg.eclipse.jem.workbench.JavaEMFNatureltnaturegt ltnaturegtorg.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.jsNatureltnaturegt ltnaturegtcom.google.appengine.eclipse.core.gaeNatureltnaturegt codepre  pSo I did that, I could turn the project into an Eclipses Dynamic Web Project and by doing so made it compliant to be added to the list of modules handled by  lets say  Tomcat 6 within Servers. So that is exactly what I wanted, I can now switch between two debug configurations at will in Eclipse in order to debug my GWT web app either on the App Engine or on Tomcat.p  pThe problem is that adding the Dynamic Web Project facet disturbs the DataNucleus enhancer. For some reason, once the project has become a Dynamic Web Project, it seems that the enhancer is never called anymore and I get this error message saying that some classes havent been enhanced. Playing with the Google... App Engine... ORM classes or checkingunchecking the Enhancer in Builders wouldnt change anything. Please note that the enhancer issue affects both debug configurations Tomcat as well as the App Engine.p  pSo I was thinking of two solutions.p  p1 Disable the Google plugins DataNucleus enhancer and perform the enhancements myself. So I installed the DataNucleus plugin to configure project specific enhancements by following their guide about the Eclipse plugin. They say that by rightclicking on the project one can activate DataNucleus support for the given projects files. Unfortunately, after installing the latest version of their plugin for Eclipse, no such rightclick menu appears I have therefore no way to tell their plugin that I want to activate the enhancements on a given project How frustrating is that I uninstalledreinstalled the plugin, let perform plenty of pending Eclipse updates... but still no rightclick menu. Does anyone know of another way to activate DataNucleus enhancement For now I would be happy even with a pretty manual trick as it is very critical for me to be able to perform this crossservlet container debugging within Eclipse.p  p2 Use this tip from the official GWT website a hrefhttpcode.google.comwebtoolkitdoclatestFAQDebuggingAndCompiling.htmlHowdoIusemyownserverinhostedmodeinsteadofGWT27s relnofollowhttpcode.google.comwebtoolkitdoclatestFAQDebuggingAndCompiling.htmlHowdoIusemyownserverinhostedmodeinsteadofGWT27sa Ok that works, and for now lets say that it saves my life BUT... it requires hosted mode and therefore doesnt allow the use of GWT 2.0. So regarding this workaround I would like to know if there is a way to do something similar under GWT 2.0p  pTurning the GWT Web App into a Eclipse Dynamic Web Project would be the ideal solution for pursuing the development of my application. As I said above, that way, it is emveryem convenient to switch from the App Engine to Tomcat and vice versa. So I favour workaround 1 over workaround 2. But anyway, some help or piece of advice regarding any of the two points will be very very welcome.p  pThank you for reading this very long postp

No IDE.p  pstrongStart with OpenCVstrongp  pThe only a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsopencvlibraryfilesopencvwin2.1 relnofollowwindows installer for OpenCV 2.1a is a visual studio installer.

Negative 64388 pIs it possible to switch from HiLo to GUID.comb As far as I can tell, the latter combines the advantage of HiLo, namely managing Ids clientside instead of needing a call to the DB for getting a new Id, with the advantage that its impossible to run out of Ids.p  pCurrently we are running into problems with HiLo generating Ids so big, that Int32 this should have been Int64, but thats more of a WTF of my predecessor isnt big enough. We can change to Int64, but this just means we will run into problem later rather than sooner.p  pAs the Ids do not need to be meaningful, a switch to GUIDs seems logical. However, as Ive never attempted such a switch, I was wondering whether anyone here could help me assessing the impact something like that could have.p

Negative 64388 pI am faced with a problem coding my next feature.  I want the user to be able to rearrange records and change the displayorder value. Im using Jquery UIs draggable and droppable to facilitate this.p  pI can see how a simple swap of displayorder values would work. But I want to set a display order for a record and ideally have the others shuffle around so there are no repeated displayorder values. Apart from not getting my head around how I would do that it seems like it would be hard to code and inefficient, shuffling every value around in the list.p  pSo I am open to other suggestions of how this sort of thing is normally, or should be done.p  pI though of maybe using a value like 3.000 to represent the order and then when I want to make a record take its place make its value 3  0.001 so its 2.999 and will sort between 2 and 3. But I can see so many things wrong with that idea and doesnt seem like a good path to follow.p  pThanks for any inputp

Negative 64388 pIm completely new to core data programming. i just try to find out where the best place for implementing the core data code would be. ive done the apple tutorial Locations and it worked well. now i try to transfer that to my current project what is a bit more complex. p  pthe Locations tutorial shows one RootViewController including a programmatically generated tableView. my project is based on a tabView template. it owns a MainWindow.xib including the TabBarController including three ViewController MapView, ListView, SettingsView where each view has its own navigationController and xibfile.p  pThe first stumbling block was changing the code that it will run with a xib for the tableView instead of creating it programmatically. Ive managed that but there is still one error. I cant connect the managedObjectContext from the appDelegate to the listViewController. Ive tried the examples and suggestions for that issue from this forum here. but it still doesnt work. p  pafter looking at the CoreDataBooks sample project ive seen that the core data code was implemented in the RootViewController as well. Seems that it would be the wrong way to implement it in the ListViewController. But i dont have a RootViewController in my project. In the AppDelegate i directly pass the tabBarController as the rootViewController. therefore i dont know how to reach the listViewController to set the context like it was done in the Locations sample.p  pAs the MapView is the first view i cant set the context in the appDelegate. And after struggling a long time with the managedObjectContext i wonder if it would be better to invent a RootViewController to be able to place additional code there. the model should be accessible by all three views and it seems that the RootViewController is the right place. p  pBut how do i combine that with a tabBarController which includes three more viewControllers based on xibfiles Could somebody recommend me examples or tutrials including core data based on a tab bar appp

Negative 64388 pGiven environment Xeon processor with 16 cores, OS  Win 2008 server R2.p  pGiven application .NetC before paralleling loads 1 core at almost 100. Obvious solution to make some profit was to use .Net 4 parallel task library to speed application up Xtimes.  Suppose the part of application that is paralleled is really appropriate  no locking occurs between threads no shared resources, each parallel task is completely independent. But to my regret the profit is really low  16threaded app works approx. 2 times faster than sequential.p  pHere is the first illustration  16 threads on 16 coresp  pimg srchttps57.radikal.rui157110948e1df69e34c43.jpg alt16p  pIt seems really weird  each task is equal but first 8 cores are loaded at almost same level 30 and other 8 have progressively descending load. p  pSo, Ive tried different configurations, for example 8 threads on 16 cores p  pimg srchttps45.radikal.rui1091109be148f110a973d.jpg alt8p  pLooks like 8 threads are all runnin on 8 cores and threads are not transfered from one core to another. Moreover, on 8 cores average core load is greater than on 16.p  pI did some research via profiler  each thread has same behaviour like in single threaded case in terms of percentage of time spent in different methods. Only and mean difference is absolute time  it gets greater and greater with the growth of thread number like if the performance of each core was degradingp  pSo the main tendencies that I cant explain  more threads mean lower average load per core and integral cpu usage is about 2025 at maximum. And each operation in thread runs slower with the growth of the number of threads.p  pAny ideas to explain this weird things p  pstrongUPDstrongp  pAfter applying Server GC the picture has changed significantly p  p8 threads on 16 cores illustrationp  pimg srchttps004.radikal.rui2071109e894d0ce0e97f3.bmp alt8AfterServerGCp  p12 threads on 16 cores illustrationp  pimg srchttpi025.radikal.ru11099f694544cf992e.bmp alt12AfterServerGCp  p15 threads on 16 cores illustrationp  pimg srchttpi003.radikal.ru1109b282033ad2eadf.bmp alt15AfterServerGCp  pSo, looks like cpu usage is increasing with the growth of core number.  First thing that botheres me is that i t looks like all of cores are used and threads are jumping from core to core, so overall performance is not as good. p  pSecond thing is that app maximum speed is at 12 cores, 15 cores give same results, 16 cores are even slower. p  pWhat is the possible reasonp

All the image processing is not made on the robot, but on a computer with NVIDIA GT425 2Gb Ram.   p  pMy questions are p  ol lipShould I mount the cameras on a rotative suport, so that they take pictures on a wider anglepli lipIt is posible creating a reasonable 3D reconstruction based on only 2 views at such a small distance in between If so, to what degree I can use this for obstacle avoidance and a best route constructionpli lipIf a roughly accurate 3D representation of the enviroment can be made, how can it be used as creating a map of the enviroment Consider the following example the robot must sweep an fairly large area and it would be energy efficient if it would not go through the same place or course twicehowever when a 3D reconstruction is made from one direction, how can it tell if it has already been there if it comes from the opposite direction  pli ol  pI have found this a hrefhttpmkoval.orgdownloadsprojectsigvcigvcdesign.pdf relnofollowresponsea on a similar question , but  I am still concerned with the accuracy of 3D reconstruction for example a couple of boxes situated at 100m considering the small resolution and distance between the cameras.p  pI am just starting gathering information for this project, so if you haved worked on something similar please give me some guidelines and some linksD on how should I approach this specific task. p  pThanks in advance, Tamashp

Negative 64388 pI have an app where I need to have two tableviews swapped in and out by once view controller.

This way, your view controller doesnt have to switch back and forth, and your code is overall cleaner and simpler. My question is, how would you go about implementing something like this, ie separate objects for the delegate  datasource, and is it better than what Im currently doingp

But if I have a class A which has another class B sitting in it as a field, and I want to 1 listen for changes in a field of class B say int var, and 2 detect these changes at the level of class A have the resulting event fire a method in class A, it is not obvious to me that this approach will work.  p  pFor if I put my listener in class A, I cant specify to listen for changes in B.var from here.  Conversely, if I put my listener in class B, which is a field of class A, then it will be able to detect changes in var, but how would I able to cause this to fire and make changes in class A, because B sits in class A as a field, and isnt aware of class As existencep  pOne solution would be to incorporate all of the fields and methods of B into A.  However, ultimately I would like to have B as a static class and have many different As, with each A listening to slightly different events in B.  The picture I have in mind in my head is of lots of different people listening to the ratio, which is broadcasting lots of different words.  Each person is watching for his own particular word to come from the radio, and each time their word occurs, they put a check on their wall or increment some field they have..p  pThanksp

For example, I have Class1 Action with field string1, and I want to change it from another action, Class2.p  precodepublic class Class1 extends ActionSupport      private String string1old String    public class Class2 extends ActionSupport      public String execute         Class1 class1new Class1         class1.setString1new String        codepre  pIn struts1, one could take all ActionForms from session. In struts2 they are no longer available on session, from the moment that there are no more action forms. Thanksp

Negative 64388 pLaunchers are most common in games. Think of League of Legends, Starcraft II, or almost any MMO out there. Before starting the actual game, you have a small launcher app that takes care of updates and patching.p  pI want to move this direction with a particular nongame application I am developing. The concept of the launcher makes perfect sense it checks for updates, replaces the appropriate binarieslibraries, maybe runs an integrity check, and launches the application. However, how do launchers update themselves This tends to be a rare event, but how is it done Does the launcher literally just write over the very binary it is currently running from Or is there some kind of swap step after the download I need to be able to push out rare updates to the launcher especially if I discover some bug in my launcher.p  pMy particular project will be in C, but I am interested in conceptually similar C andor Java solutions as well for future reference.p
Negative 64388 pI need to show a link to download a file on a page in a JSF 2 application. Now, the issue is that the file contains data that depends on fresh looks into the database at the time of creation.

The button creates an excel file, saves it to a location, and updates the file name in the database. Then the link serves the file. But its a two step process for the user. What Id like it to be is just one step. So that one link, for example p  precodelta hrefbean.findBidsListFileNamegtDownload Your Bidsltagt codepre  por, most likely, a jsf commandLink will create the excel file on the back end, save it to the resources location, and seamlessly open a save dialog on the users machine. p

Negative 64388 pI have recently began working on a small project that utilizes some custom created modules that I would like to eventually open source.

Negative 64388 pIm going for a Facebookesque slideover UITableView.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVNHnv.png altenter image description herep  pIve accomplished that, animation and drop shadow and everything. My worry is that Im doing it the the completely wrong way, and that come things dont work completely right.p  pThe application has a rootViewController of the UIWindow that is a UINavigationController. A view inside the UINavigationController its root view controller has its leftBarButtonItem property set. Here is the code that runs when the button is pressed.p  precode voidshowFeedList      set the feed list as showing even before it is     feedListShowing  YES     to show the feed list, we need to instanciate one     feedSelectionListViewController  [[FeedSelectionListViewController alloc] initWithNibName FeedSelectionListViewController bundle nil]     set the frame to 200 points to the left of the screen     feedSelectionListViewController.view.frame  CGRectOffsetfeedSelectionListViewController.view.frame, 200, 20      NSInteger offset  feedSelectionListViewController.view.frame.size.width      store a pointer to the root navigation controller, and add the list view controllers view to the navigation controllers view     UINavigationController navigationController  UINavigationController UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate.window.rootViewController     [navigationController.view addSubview feedSelectionListViewController.view]      animate the navigation bar, feed selection list, and this view controllers view to the right     [UIView animateWithDuration LISTSHOWTRANSITIONTIME animations          self.view.frame  CGRectOffsetself.view.frame, offset, 0         navigationController.navigationBar.frame  CGRectOffsetnavigationController.navigationBar.frame, offset, 0         feedSelectionListViewController.view.frame  CGRectOffsetfeedSelectionListViewController.view.frame, offset, 0     ]  codepre  pThis is really messy, and not everything about it works right. First, when the user leaves and comes back to the application, the UINavigationBar seems to have reset its frame. This also happens when the incall status bar is toggled on and off. Secondly, any views inside the view on the right do not move to the right as they should. I do not know why this is.p  pHowever, if I replace the animation block withp  precode    navigationController.view.frame  CGRectOffsetnavigationController.view.frame, 200, 0 codepre  pIt works fine. The subviews of the view currently displayed by the navigation controller move accordingly, and everything is in the right place when the application is resumed. However, the sidebar view is not receiving touch events, touches that are made over the sidebar are now handled by the AppDelegate.

We will use an array of Card objects to manage the actual cards in the deck.p  pThe following are the class and instance fields, followed by the methods of the Deck class. Complete each item in the following order.p  pClass Constantsp  pDeclare and initialize the following public static class constants CARDSINDECK  An integer value to represent the number of cards in the deck. Set this equal to 52. SHUFFLESWAPS  An integer value to represent the number of times cards should switch positions during the shuffling of the deck. The higher the number, the more random and thoroughly shuffled the deck will be. Set this equal to at least 500. Instance Fieldsp  pDeclare the following instance fields An array of Card objects that will be used to manage the CARDSINDECK cards in the deck. Each element in the array is a single Card object. An integer that holds the index of the next card to be dealt from the array of Cards. As a side note, this variable will start at 0 and increase by 1 each time a card is dealt see methods below. An integer variable that maintains the random seed provided for testing. Methodsp  pThe following is the list of methods you must complete. p  pcodepublic Deckint seedcode  This is the constructor of the Deck class. You must first initalize your array of Card objects to hold 52 cards using your class constant CARDSINDECK. After your array is initialized, you must go through the array one element at a time and actually create a Card object. All cards must be created values 214 for each of the four suits, and there must not be any duplicates. The seed parameter should be stored in the instance field for the seed. HINT Use Card.CLUBS, Card.LOWESTVALUE, etc., in this constructor.p  pcodepublic void shufflecode  This method handles resetting the deck for a new hand to be played. This method must handle shuffling the deck by using the Random class to generate random numbers. You must randomly generate two integers between 051. Then, you must swap the cards at those two positions. For example, if the random numbers are 20 and 11, and the 2 of Clubs is in element 20 of the array and the 3 of Hearts is in element 11 of the array, after these two cards are swapped element 20 will hold the 3 of Hearts, and element 11 will hold the 2 of Clubs. You must repeat this process of generating two numbers and swapping the cards in the corresponding locations for as many times as the class constant SHUFFLESWAPS indicates that you should. If the random seed is not 1, the Random object you create should use the provided random seed. This will ensure that the deck will be shuffled the same way every time you run the program with the same random seed. For example,p  pcodeRandom rand  new Randomseedcode If the random seed is 1, create a Random object with no seed, which will create a different game every time you play. For example,p  pcodeRandom rand  new Randomcode Finally, the index used for selecting the next card to be dealt from the deck must be reset to 0. p  pcodepublic Card nextCardcode  This method returns the next card in the deck based on the instance field that knows the position within the array where the next card to be dealt is located. Before returning the card, make sure you update this number so that the next time the method is called, the next card in the deck will be returned increase it by 1.p  pcodepublic String toStringcode  This method returns a String representation of the Deck which will come in handy for Unit Testing. HINT call the toString method of the Card class for each Card in the array of Card objects.p  hr  pI think I got codepublic Deck int seedcode method right. Can you take a look at that The card object has parameter of  int value, char suit, so for deck, I am returning  int, char. After this method, I am not really sure how to go from there. Can somebody please give me some pointers on thisp

Negative 64388 pIm creating a image editing program in PHP and Javascript but I cant work out the math.p  pThe idea is, user uploads a image  It can be very large, 10 000 x 10 000 pixels and it can be small 500 x 500 pixels and its resized with PHP to fit to workarea resized to smaller or bigger. Workarea is calculated from users screen size using Javascript. Original image is stored and thumb is generated. At this point, user can rotate and crop the image. Cropping and rotating is done with the thumb image to save resources with PHP. Data is saved to session data as in rotation angle, cropping  x, y, width, height, resize  ratio of width and height codeoriginalimagewidth  thumbimagewidthcode. When user clicks on Done button, all those steps are applied to original image. If its rotating, total angle is calculated to avoid calling rotating function multiple times. If its cropping, the codexcode, codeycode, codewidthcode and codeheightcode must be calculated so that cropping takes place only once.p  pNow this is where it get complicated. Since resizing takes place between each cropping to fit to workarea I cant seem to work out the math to calculate to needed variables codexcode, codeycode, codewidthcode, codeheightcode.

The most common case is 512 columns by 512 rows. I need to consider matricies of the size 512 x 512, 1024 x 512, 512 x 1024, and other combinations, but the largest will be a 1024 x 1024 matrix. I have been using a rather simple kernel callp  precodelaunchKernelltltlt1,512gtgtgt................ codepre  pThis kernel works fine for the common 512x512 and 512 x 1024 column, row respectively case, but not for the 1024 x 512 case. This case requires 1024 threads to execute. In my naivity i have been trying differnt versions of the simple kernel call to launch 1024 threads.p  precodelaunchKernelltltlt2,512gtgtgt................   2 blocks with 512 threads each  launchKernelltltlt1,1024gtgtgt................  1 block with 1024 threads  codepre  pI beleive my problem has something to do with my lack of understanding of the threads and blocksp  pHere is the output of deviceQuery, as you can see i can have a max of 1024 threadsp  precodeCProgramDataNVIDIA CorporationNVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.1Cbinwin64ReleasedeviceQuery.exe Starting...

Negative 64388 pIn cell R12, I have an integer that changes each time I need to run this macro. I need the macro to analyze what the number is in that cell, and find the one other cell on the spreadsheet guaranteed to be in the range M31M40 because that is where the match will be that matches the contents of the cell R12, and then makes the matched cell the active cell.br Obviously, I could tell excel what the contents are in R12, and do a search, but I need it to determine whats in R12 by itself...then find the matching cell, and go there.p  pNo one types the value of R12. It is calculated. R12 is a number that is created by totaling the contents of ten other cells in that column. I am trying to leave breadcrumbs for my macro to find its way back to a certain spot on the spreadsheet, where the macro can continue and paste data there... Im hoping Excel can determine the number in R12, and find that exact number elsewhere on the sheet..by itself.  That same number WILL exist in the other array... M31M40 If it somehow can move the active cell to the matching number, I can get my active cell back to where I started the macro. The full contents of the macro werent posted. Hope that clarifies.p

Negative 64388 pMy Setup I have two tables tblAuthors and tblBooks. tblAuthors includes a list authors Kurt Vonnegut, Frank Herbert, J. K. Rowling, John Nichols, etc.. tblBooks includes a list of books Slaughter House Five, Cats Craddle, Monkey House, Dune, Harry Potter, Milagro Beanfield War, etc..p  pI have two forms as well frmAuthor and frmBooks. frmAuthor includes the name of the author as well as some more author specific information that isnt particularly relevant to this question date of birth, place of birth, preffered genre, inspirations, etc.. frmBooks includes the authors names as well as some other information publishing company, date completed, genre.p  pThere is also a onetomany relationship between tblBooks and tblAuthors Authors in tblAuthors is used as the primary key for this relationship. Just to give you a better idea on how these tables enteract and the thought behind the organization of the database.p  pThe way these forms interact is as follows The intended way to update this database is to input information by book into frmBooks. If the author for the book is missing a window will come up prompting the user to add a new author from the NotInList event. If the user hits yes the frmAuthors will pop. The user will input the Authors information and then hit the done command at the bottom of the form which will return the user back to frmBooks to complete entering the data for the other book. p  pI am looking for a way to autopopulate the field Author based on the input from the NotInList event. Currently it is saved as a temporary variable and author input on the second form saves it in the table. I simply want to simplify the process and have the input in the first form carry over and automatically populate the same field in the second form.p  pI am not really familiar with VBA and could use an explantion that is geared towards someone who may not understand all of the facets of the code. p  pThank you in advance for any help that you give mep
Negative 64388 pFor a special project I chose to write my very own tiny web server which is actually quite easy with the .Net Framework HttpListener class.p  pEverything was working beautifully until yesterday when I started to test with Internet Explorer.p  pMy server kept crashing on any ie request  I finally managed to figure the reason out  ie litterally stutters  well at least ie7 and ie8, Ive not tried other versions yet.p  pThe problem never occurs with FireFox nor Chrome nor Opera.p  pTo be more specific, Im using dynamic javascript insertion in the web page to get around the same origin policy in a crossdomain call scenario. This script generates a request to my tiny server. Lets say the request built is p  precodehttplocalhost8081myServicep1A,p2B,p3C,p4D,p5E codepre  pWith FFox, Chrome or Opera, my server indeed receives a single request from the browser p  precodehttplocalhost8081myServicep1A,p2B,p3C,p4D,p5E codepre  pwith ie, my server receives a random amount of partial requests like p  precodehttplocalhost8081myServicep1A, httplocalhost8081myServicep1A,p2B, httplocalhost8081myServicep1A,p2B,p3C, httplocalhost8081myServicep1A,p2B,p3C,p4D, codepre  pand in fact a lot of them since I have 20 parameters or so...p  pand finally p  precodehttplocalhost8081myServicep1A,p2B,p3C,p4D,p5E codepre  pThis is bascically not big deal as my logic is able to handle the lacking parameters situation. The problem is that each incomplete request actually closes the connection error 1229. That was crashing the server which was trying to answer to each request. The fix was easy but I still dont like the fact that the server is flooded with those intermediate unanswerable and thus unuseful requests. Moreover, the request sometimes looks like p  precodehttplocalhost8081myServicep1A,p2B,p3C,p1A,p2B,p3C,p4D,p5E codepre  p p  pI traced the javascript  the generation function is called only once whatever browser so this really sounds like an ie issue.p  pDoes anyone have an idea to prevent this behaviour from ie p

Negative 64388 pIm making a Rails app which will feature a lot of calculated or aggregated data, i.e. information which is computed by performing expensive operations on the data stored by the user. Im thinking I need some way of storing this data so A. I am not constantly performing expensive DB operations, and B. So that I can spit out reports with pretty graphs over time etc for given attributes.p  pIm wondering what the best way to implement this is Id need to be calculating and storing values numeric for a given model, and how they change over time. I want this to be efficient and avoid duplicating and data. The records will be pretty much fixed once created, so I dont need to worry about things being changed too much, though it needs to be considered.p  pI just wondered what the most common approach to this is, and how I should go about implementing this within a Rails appp

Negative 64388 pJust something I been working on has been bugging me and I cant help think someone else will point me to a simple solution.p  pPart of a program I am writing involves the followingp  pI have a C program that applies a series of filters to a spreadsheet using autosort. The data that has been sorted I want to remove, currently it kind of does this use specialcells but I think my method isnt brilliant. p  pBefore removing data I get rid of the first row which is my headings as to not include this in the delete. However this can cause an issue, If i remove the headings and the filtered data actually returned no more that 0 rows then when I call my specialcell to delete it will flag up some kind of error stating there is no range. Whats the best solution to this, ideally I could grab the filtered range and check if the data has more than 1 row but the properties I been trying such as rows.count is flagging up the wrong sort of data. Here is a simplified version of my codep  precodeExcel.Range AllRange  mySheet.UsedRange Excel.Range filtered  AllRange.SpecialCellsMicrosoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlCellType.xlCellTypeVisible, Type.Missing  if SOME SORT OF COUNT SHOULD GO HERE IM GUESSING gt 1   mySheet.Rows.EntireRow[1].Hidden  true  filtered  mySheet.UsedRange.SpecialCellsMicrosoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlCellType.xlCellTypeVisible, Type.Missing  filtered.EntireRow.DeleteExcel.XlDirection.xlUp mySheet.Rows.EntireRow[1].Hidden  false         codepre  pSomething like that, I hope that helps.

Negative 64388 pI have a need to integrate a zoom slider for a codeQGraphicsViewcode in Qt 4.x, I have a working implementation that goes something like thisp  precodeconnectslider, SIGNALvalueChangedint, customGraphicsView, SLOTsetZoomLevelint codepre  pIn the slot for codesetZoomLevelcode I have the followingp  precodevoid CustomViewsetZoomLevelint level      ifzoomLevel  level lt 1         setZoomLevellevel  1     else iflevel  zoomLevel lt 1         setZoomLevellevel  1          iflevel lt zoomLevel         scale1  scaleFactor  zoomLevel  level, 1  scaleFactor  zoomLevel  level     else if level gt zoomLevel         scale1  scaleFactor  level   zoomLevel, 1  scaleFactor  level   zoomLevel           zoomLevel  level  codepre  pSo my issue is stemming from mating a slider which has a value of n to m to represent a zoom level to the codescalecode function of codeQGraphicsViewcode, which takes two floating point values to multiply the scene by to get a new size.p  pSo the problem Im having is, if you take 1  .9  1.1 you do not still get 1 but instead .99, its off slightly because it isnt a correct formula. So my max zoom gets smaller and smaller over time.p  pThe recursive calls are because the slider would sometimes skip values on fast slides, which increased the error, so I smoothed it out to bandage it a little.p  pIs there a correct way of handling zoomsp

Negative 64388 pI am trying to create a package in R wherein I have created lots of new custom Classes. Each class is in a different file. The Classes inherit from a parent class and inherit to other classes.p  pWhile running my codes I call each of them like thisp  precodesourcepackagefather.R sourcepackageson.R sourcepackagegrandson.R      codepre  pDefinition for Some of the methods needed by the grandson Class in defined in Son class. I use package.skeleton to call each of them and create a package and it seems to work fine. But when running R CMD Checkand when trying install into R, it throws an error because the function tries to call the files in the alphabetical order and so the file grandson.R is called before son.R and it shows and error saying that the methods has not been defined. If I change the names to zgrandson.R, R called that file the last, and everything seems to work fine, but this is evidently not a solution for the problem. p  pI have read tutorials for creating packages, but all of them seem to deal with simple cases where there is no inheritancecalling other files in R. Hope I have made myself clear.p  pP.S  This is my first post, so please bear with me if there are any mistakes.p

There are several functions on lists of the form codea gt [a]code, and its sort of ambiguous as to which one is correct.p  pDoes this mean that code[a]code cannot be properly instantiated properly as a comonad, or is it simply up to the user to decide what codecojoincode will actually dop

Negative 64388 pI have been doing some testing on a project that I recently started building with CMake.

Negative 64388 pSituation  In have lot of view controllers in my app and they are presented as navigation or modal view controllers. The app communicates with the server from almost all the screens. I want to show a login screen to the user when hisher credentials are expired. I want to present the login screen as a modal on top of the current view on the screen and dismiss it as soon as login is successful.  I have really no idea how can I achieve this. If there is a modal view displayed on the screen by some view controller and login screen is also required to be presented as a modal, from where should I do this. I tried switching rootViewController of the window in appDelegate but it didnt work well and also messed up lot of things. Please provide me suggestions. p
Negative 64388 pLets say I have a shared object with field codedatacode. Multiple threads will share a reference to this object in order to access the field. The threads never access the object concurrently, though. Do I need to declare codedatacode as volatilep  pSuch a situation would be the following p  ul liA class codeCountercode defines a unique field codevaluecode and one method codeincrementcode. li liA thread increments the counter, then spawn another thread that increments the counter, etc. li ul  pGiven the very logic of the program, there is no concurrent access to the counter. The counter is however shared accross multiple threads. Must the counter be a volatile p  pAnother variant of the situation is when multiple threads manipulate an object X that is plain data, but alternate their temporal execution so that X is never accessed concurrently via another object Y that rely on concurrency control codewaitcode, codenotifycode, codesynchronizecode. Should fields of object X be volatile p

Negative 64388 pSo I have had a number of classes bundled together as a static framework using the universal framework project posted by Kyle here a hrefhttpsgithub.comkstenerudiOSUniversalFramework relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkstenerudiOSUniversalFrameworkap  pThings compile and run just fine on iOS 5.0 up through 6.0, and have for several months now  I generally just copy the resulting framework into my project, link it up, and use it. It uses ARC for most classes.p  pRecently, I created a static library project from scratch in xcode 4.5 and copied all the classes from the framework into it. It compiled straight off, as did the project I added it to previously used with the framework, but when I run it on my iPhone 4 w iOS 5.1.1, it crashes during runtime with an EXCBADACCESS message and doesnt highlight any specific code associated with the crash. Everything works well on the iOS 6.0 simulator, and an iPhone 4S I have thats running iOS 6.p  pThe most Ive figured out is that the error is occurring within a rather large block that registers as a background process and uses a location manager. Im currently backinstalling the 5.1 simulator to see if that crashes too.p  pAre there any major differences in the way static libraries and static frameworks are treated that I might not be aware of Any significant differences between iOS 5 and 6 in that respect Ive played around with linker flags a little, including ObjC and allload. Are there any pieces of code or error strings that would be helpful for me to post I didnt include anything yet since im not entirely sure where the issue is...p

Thats because Im only trying to just test this .ajax function out and later Ill add a form and invoke that call from some event.  So that should not matter, that I dont have a form element yet right  I simply have .ajax call at the top of my view in the open so it fires off on its own.p  pstrong2strong It seems like its hitting my routes ok as you can see above.  I just wonder if its how Im forming my .ajax call in terms of the callback and maybe related to, my controller method is not fully correct  Im returning json from my action but its ok to have how I have it I assume.  I dont know, unless I can try something different in my action method thats returning the json.  I dont know if my .ajax call needs to specify the return type expected in the callback now that I just thought about it as I am typing this but Ill check that also.p  pfor example when I setup the .ajax call like this see below, Im getting a response back so I think that tells me IIS is able to send a response after it hit my route and controller ok.  So Im thinking its my action method thats not returning a correct json object, not really sure but at this point, if the route debugger from Phil Haack shows its definitely hitting my routes, then it cant be that...the ajax call IS hitting my route.  p  precode   .ajax         url OurAppSearchMember26049,         type GET,         dataType json,         success function response                       alertwe got a mother fing response             grid  new Slick.GridmemberSearchResultsGrid, response.data, columns, options         ,         error function e  alertresponse error        codepre  pso I get the alert for the error case above, its hitting this.  I dont know if I will always get a response...probably I assume IIS would respond in a failed request AND successful route request...p  pI tried to attach to the worker process and then refresh the page after setting a debug point on the first line of that action method thats returning json in my controller but that line is never hit.

Negative 64388 pIm developing some app with custom UITableViewCells. Ive one nib for the cell and I use only a cell identifier.p  pIn cellForRowAtIndexPath Ive some code like thisp  precodespot.text  [NSString stringWithFormatd., [forecastRow.position intValue]] if[[forecastRow prob1] floatValue] gt 0.5     spot.textColor  [UIColor redColor]  codepre  pwhere spot is an UBOutlet for an UILabel. The fact is that the number is shown correctly, and the color is firstly assigned to the proper cells. But, when I scroll, numbers keep ok, but the color red is assigned randomly to spot label on other cells not passing the if all over the table.p  pWhats happening Why the text is correct, but not the color Why this messes up only when scrolling I think the solution is not using several identifiers and nibs for such a little task change a UILabel color, as I need to assign more than one different color to the rows labels, based on complex conditions.p

Negative 64388 pI am having an issue with a snippet of javascript on a VF page where I am hoping someone can enlighten me where the code is flawing. To give a small background, the VF page has a picklist and an input field that are readupdated by the JS. There is jquery code in the script to autcomplete the Product input text field by retrieving the list of possible matches from the controller via remoting call. To downsize the result   I pass in the pricebook Id and the lineType from the Line Type picklist. I am trying to get the linetype to execute the code on the onchange event so to cache the results before the user types them in the input field. In my soe so far the line type changing event is firing the code and based on the alerts, I can see that the method in the controller is getting called and returns the list, BUT there are 2 issues on the resultp  p1 The .change event is not firing more than once, so the first time I cahnge the picklist value, the code fires and executes the remoting call, but any subsequent change to the picklist is not firing the code again. Why is that shouldnt the .change always fire when changes are made to the selection of the picklistp  p2 The autocomplete is not suggesting values based on the reusult from the call, meaning I dont see the pop up with the suggestions returned from the remoting call.p  pBelow is the relevant code VF page, js and controller method. please someone give me a handp  pVF  js codep  precodeltscriptgt var pop, prodNames, pbId, lineType, availableProds j  jQuery.noConflict jfunction       jselect[idfLineType].changefunction          pbId   jinput[idpbid].val         lineType  jthis.val         alertLine type selected  jthis.val      pbId            call remote apex method and get chache list of Prod Names         SalesDocumentManagerController.cacheProdNamespbId, lineType,              functionresult, event                 alertResult from remote call   result                 availableProds  result             ,              escape true                    jinput[idprodName].autocomplete         source availableProds,         minLength 3        codepre  pcontroller remote method currently returning dummy data This seems to work since it returns the values created below  p  precodeRemoteAction     public static String[] cacheProdNames String pbId, String lineType          system.debugremote action is executing         String[] prodNames  new ListltStringgt         prodNames.addtestProd         prodNames.addtestProd 2         return prodNames      codepre

Negative 64388 pWe would like to connect a salesforce user to another salesforce user in another org without any user intervention from a service.p  pWe have tried SAML Bearer Flow using Remote Access Application to connect to salesforce to retreive Access Token for one of our product. We are referring to the follwoing article.p  pa hrefhttphelp.salesforce.comhelpdocenremoteaccessoauthSAMLbearerflow.htm relnofollowhttphelp.salesforce.comhelpdocenremoteaccessoauthSAMLbearerflow.htmap  pAs referred by the SF article for this flow, it uses a previous user authorization to connect and retreive Token. In case the user for whom Token is requested has not already authorized the App, SF takes you to the Authorization page first and app will get the access token once app is authorized. This is working fine too. However it has this painful step of users authorizing the app before we can use this flow for the product. It would be good and simplified if this step can be done once for an org and the article does mentions that either User or Admin can authorize the app. However I am not able to find how an Admin can authorize the remote access application.p  pDoes anyone knows and can guide how can an Admin authorize an App or is thre any other way we can achieve our requirement. Any thoughts will be really appreciated.p

Negative 64388 pWhen designing a website what would be good practice for the strongurl designingstrong and related backend. Say I have a strongwebsitestrong with news posts on it. I would like the url to look like thisp  blockquote   pmysite.comnewsnewsItem1p blockquote  pNormally an url like this would reference to a folder called newsItem1 on the server. But in this case there will be a lot of newsItems stored as xml files, and I dont think its a good idea to create a folder for every item.p  pThe same thing happens when I make the url like thisp  blockquote   pmysite.comnewsnewsItem1.htmlp blockquote  pIn that case I would have to make a html file for every newsItem.p  pWhat I would like is an url that is different for every newsItem, but on the server it basically points to a php file that parses the matching xml file and returns its contents.

Negative 64388 pIm slightly baffled by some behaviour I dont understand from the compiler. Ive reduced it to the following code samplep  precode    public interface IFoo       public interface IBarltTgt  IFoo       public delegate void DHandlerltTgtIBarltTgt arg      public static class Demo              static void GarplyltTgtDHandlerltTgt handler            public static void DoStuffWithInt                      GarplyltintgtHandler                   static void HandlerIFoo arg        codepre  pMy problem is that I dont expect the code to compile, but it does. I dont expect it to compile because codeDHandlerltintgtcode requires codeIBarltintgtcode in the signature, but the codeHandlercode method declares codeIFoocode, which is emnotem codeIBarltintgtcode although the converse is true. Hence codeHandlercode is not a codeDHandlerltintgtcode and so a delegate to it wouldnt be usable as an argument to a codeGarplyltintgtcode call.p  pIf I change the code to read codeHandlerIBarltintgt argcode it compiles. If I change it to read codeHandlerIBarltstringgt argcode it doesnt. Both those behaviours are as Id expect.p  pThe practical problem that prompts this question is that when the signature is codeHandlerIBarltintgt argcode, the compiler complains that I need to explicitly specify the type parameter for the codeGarplycode call. Trivial in this example, but in the actual code itll be a real nuisance. I was mystified, since the argument to codeGarplycode is a method with the signature codeIBarltintgt argcode, so the delegate to it would be a codeDHandlerltintgtcode, so the chosen codeGarplyltTgtcode would unambiguously be codeGarplyltintgtcode. But apparently the compiler saw an ambiguity. It was investigating that, that led me to the above puzzle and I can only guess that perhaps the compiler is thinking well, to Jasons surprise, Id have accepted an codeIFoocode for this codeIBarltTgtcode, so a codeTcode has to be specified to allow me to know that I should compile it as codeIBarltTgtcode and not as codeIFoocode. That might explain why it wants the type parameter. But can anyone cast light on thisp

Negative 64388 pOn beginning i have to apologize if i made 2nd topic instead of sticking to the first one but im new to stackoverflow.p  pIve asked in the previous question i had a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15616103creatingdynamicvectoronpredefinedstructCreating dynamic vector on predefined structap  pAnd received a lot of useable informations about the problem ive had. But the problem is still not quite transparent for me to solve it. p  pstill working  that structurep  precodetypedef struct somestructs      int s     union          unsigned char ptr         unsigned char lptr[sizeofchar ]      somestructt  codepre  pSince my last question ive been coding and trying my best to find the solution. The problem got a lot clearer to me since then. The point of this program is to create an dynamic and extendable map, map that will be used for bit operations. The endpoint is a map on which we can set some bits like set bit on 260 index of our map to 1. If map can fit in memory occupied by the pointer to the map, then we can place it there, and that the point of this union. Another problem is that if there is an question about the bit that doesnt fit inside the map there is no error. We simply answer, there is bit 0. So for example if we set 0 on bit place that does not fit inside that map we dont extend the map. Map extending should only take place under 1 circumstance we need to set bit to 1 outside of map.p  pAnatolyS gave me a few ice breaking tipsp  pA function, that if i understand well, returns pointer or map based on size sp  precodeunsigned char somestructgetbitmapsomestructt ths      if sizeofchar gt thsgts           return thsgtptr     return thsgtlptr  codepre  pand a bit clarification on contructordestructorp  precodeunsigned char somestructinitsomestructt ths, unsigned char ptr      thsgts  strlenptr  1     if sizeofchar gt thsgts           thsgtptr  strdupptr        return          strcpythsgtlptr, ptr   unsigned char somestructdestroysomestructt ths      if sizeofchar gt thsgts            freethsgtptr         return       codepre  pBut i still dont see it clear enough. Especially i dont quite understand the constructor and how the memory realloc should look like under the circumstance of extending the map. Or how to manipulate the pointer to set and get the values of the extendable map.p  pSorry that i cant express that simpler but the information is limited. As is my knowledge p

Negative 64388 pI have a problem regarding parts of the QT framework. I am using QT 5.0.2 and am developing on Windows at the moment.p  pIn my application I have a Tableview set up with a QSqlRelationalTableModel. Next to it I have a text field and 3 combo boxes connected to the relational table model.

Under the widgets i have a buttonbox containing a save and a reset button.p  pWhen the save button gets clicked, I do thisp  precodeqDebug ltlt thisgtmappergtsubmit qDebug ltlt modelgtlastError.text codepre  pThis will create the following outputp  precodetrue     codepre  pWhich means the submit was successful and there was no error reported.p  pNevertheless only the first field gets updated in the model. All the other widgets reset their value to the value from the original model because the model emits datachanged, which the mapper connected itself to, I guess.p  pI tried removing one or 2 of the mappings and always onl the field whichs mapping gets added first will be updated.p  pIf I change the submitPolicy to autoSubmit the mapper does its work as intended. But I really need to have those reset and apply buttons and not have the data get submitted on change.p  pThis seems like an occurrence of a hrefhttpsbugreports.qtproject.orgbrowseQTBUG1086 relnofollowQTBug 1086a but that bug got fixed and I cant reproduce the problem from the bug report from the code there either.p  pI hope you can help me.p

Negative 64388 pHopefully simple question. Im trying to learn basic ObjectiveC compiling from the command line, with clang. I understand that Xcode is a better solution for complex projects and I plan on moving to it soon, but I personally feel I understand a language better if I can compile it manually in a terminal, and for small introductory programming projects I find it less of a hassle to compile in a terminal than having to start a new project. p  pSo the question is how do I compile an ObjectiveC program that consists of multiple files from the command line Im trying to do the fraction program from chapter 7 of Kochans textbook, with a main.m and Fraction.m file that both import Fraction.h, and a Fraction.h file that imports the Foundation framework. To compile a single file I use something likep  precodeclang fobjcarc main.m o prog1 codepre  pBut if I type that and I want to include files other than main.m in the project, I get errors includingp  precodeld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation codepre  pIf I try to add the additional files to the command as arguments, likep  precodeclang fobjcarc main.m Fraction.h Fraction.m o prog1 codepre  pthen I getp  precodeclang error cannot specify o when generating multiple output files codepre  pAnd if I then remove the o argument likep  precodeclang fobjcarc main.m Fraction.h Fraction.m codepre  pthen I get a giant pile of errors all referring to the foundation framework, eventually ending in fatal error too many errors emitted, stopping now.p  pHow do I do this and make it work Or do I need to just suck it up and use Xcode as soon as more than one file is involvedp

Negative 64388 pI am trying to do something that seems simple but I cant figure out. I am using JPA2 and hibernate but I would like a solution that could also work with another provider like EclipseLink but that is a secondary concern.p  pI have a credential table that just has a password hash, a salt, and a user id. I have a user table with some user data.p  pHere are my requirements p  ol liEvery user must have one credential, so it is onetoone.li liThe app only needs the credential for creating a user and logging inli liMany other objects contain users i.e. invoices, history, address, etc and I do not want those to indirectly load credentials every time I operate on them.li liI want a credential to be automatically cleaned up when a user is cleaned up.li ol  pSo here is my first attemptp  precodeEntity public class Credential      Id     private Long id      MapsId     OneToOne optional  false   Btw, I dont care if this is lazy loaded or not     JoinColumn name  userid      private User user      ...      public Credential User user, String password          this.user  user         set salt and hash from password   Entity public class User      Id     GeneratedValue     private Long id      OneToOne optionalfalse, mappedByuser, cascade  CascadeType.ALL, fetch  FetchType.LAZY      private Credential credential  this I do what lazy loaded      ...      public void setPassword String password           credential  new Credential this, password         User user  new User user.setName Charles Bukowski  user.setPassword b00z3   service.transactedPersist user  codepre  pto this.p  pOkay, so now when I persist User can you guess what happens Right, I get a data integrity exception on inserting the credential. Thats because, yup, the user.id is set properly but there is no row yet in the user table. If I make credential optionaltrue it mysteriously works but I seem to get an extra update on User after a persist and all my queries that reference user now also query for credentials.p  pTo be honest I wouldnt even reference a credential in user if I didnt need a cascade delete. If I were doing this without JPA that is how I would do it. I would set credential to be deleted each time a user was deleted but NOT have a reference in User for Credential. But with JPA I can only ensure that Credential is cleaned up if I add a attribute to it in User.p  pAnyway, the requirements are the important part so if you think I should be using a different design to achieve this Im totally open to a better one. p  pI honestly wish JPA had the ability to use references as fields. Most of my objects that use User really only need his unique id. But I seem to load him AND the credential and other OneToOne mappings in User each time I read a referring entity.p  pThanks in advance,p  pOh, I think the answer to some of this might be to use bytecode instrumentation with lazy loading. But I am using Spring with CTW and Intellij. So I cant really figure out how to make that happen when I am debugging integration tests in IntelliJ. So any pointers there would be great.p

Negative 64388 pI am having a lot of trouble working with these Tables. I am porting an iPhone app over to the iPad. I have two UITableViews on the iPad, each with their own Controller. On the iPhone, these tables each have their own screen. When you get to the first table a list of categories, you select a row, and then a push segue brings you to the second table all of the items that pertain to that specific category. However, on the iPad, I cannot get the second table to update when a cell is selected from the first table. I cannot reloadData because I am having trouble telling the 2nd table what category was picked from the 1st table.p  pSome good news Both tables show up on the root view controller UIViewController. Table 1 shows all of its categories, and table 2 shows all of the items from the first category from viewDidLoad I programmed it to display the first set of items to ensure that it was at least working.p  pSo my question is the line in the title, how do I change the content of the 2nd table based on which cell is selected from the firstp  pEDIT I have more than just 2 tables on this one iPad view. I tried to post an image, but cant yet.. There are 4 table views, a custom Banner ad imageview, and some labels.p

Negative 64388 pI have a hashmap in my program which is accessed by multiple threads, and is occasionally set by a single thread.p  pFor examplep  precodeMapltString, Stringgt myMap  new HashMapltString, Stringgt codepre  pThis is accessed by multiple threads. Once an hour, a single thread callsp  precodemyMap  myRefreshedVersionOfTheMap codepre  pSo my question is whether or not this is thread safe. If both maps always have the key codeimportantKeycode, is it possible for a reading thread to ever access the map at a time when codeimportantKeycode does not existp  pEditp  pThanks to the answers, Ive realized this question is actually independent of the HashMap. It was more a question about object reference assignment.p
Negative 64388 pIm working on a kind of image gallery in Swing a view of a jscrollpane basically, but Im a bit stuck.p  pI have modified MigLayout so it can give me some extra functionality that I need.p  pI have some parts of my logic, that in order to take a decision I have to lay out my view under some specific constraints to see how it would look like, such as the width at 100, the number of columns, the biggest component in a column under a specific zoom level, etc.p  pBut, I dont want to see my components flickering while Im doing these tests. So what Im doing is creating a second orphan JPanel with a copy of my components, so I can do these tests without affecting my final and effective view. But this solution sounds to me a bit botched and a bit sluggish. I could also do something like disabling the setBounds while I do these tests, but it is not nice either.p  pI know the best thing would be not to do these tests, but that sounds easier to say than to do. And anyway Im not convince about that either.p  pHave you ever find yourself on this situationp  pThanksp
Negative 64388 pIm creating a particle system renderer, the problem is that all my particle positions are encapsulated into classes that integrate them over time and do some other stuff.

Negative 64388 pthere is something I dont fully understand with OpenGL  According to everything Im reading, you get the best performance by compiling the shaders just long enough to attach them to a program, and then it is recommended you delete the shader itself to free memory and just track the program until its deleted.p  pSo my question is this  if the above is true, whats the purpose of being able to attach shaders and relink the program after its been created  Isnt it more efficient to just create a second shader program and swap between them during scene creation instead of detachingattaching and relinking programsp

However, you only want to count the number of emdistinctem orders eg only 1 for each unique OrderID for a particular product.

Negative 64388 pIm trying to figure out how to deal with logging in a CQRS setting.

In CQRS, it seems to me that logging isnt an emeventem per se, it is rather the systems response to an event. On the other hand, a log request seems like a command, i.e. the C in CQRS.p  pId love to put this into the event broker somehow, but Im not sure. Do commands belong on the event broker anyway, can we assume that the broker is just some messaging system that doesnt really care if its C or Qp  pYour help is much appreciatedp
Negative 64388 pI wrote some Apple script to take advantage of the extra buttons of my mouse say invoke Back from my web browser and it runs fine inside AppleScript editor.

The characters starting row and column position is stated. p  pThen the loop asks whether you want to move up, down left or right. It checks to see if there is a wall the  character in the way and reacts accordingly. p  pAs you can see, it makes a duplicate of the level called displaylevel and then puts an  as the character onto display level. The problem is however is that changing displaylevel changes level as well for no apparent reason, even though they are separate and each time the loop runs through it makes displaylevellevel.p  pdisplaylevel and level are then printed separately and it shows level being edited along side displaylevel which shouldnt happen.p  pSo what I want to know is why changing an part of displaylevel would change level and how I can fix it.p  pMuch appreciatedp

Negative 64388 pIm trying to use the new EffectFactoryEffect to add effects to images off screen i.e. framebuffer. Ive looked at the a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavaextcom.google.androidandroidapps4.1.1r1comexampleandroidmediafxHelloEffects.java relnofollowHelloEffects.java examplea provided in the SDK and Ive tried it out and it works. Except it obviously uses a GLSurfaceView and that isnt what I want.p  pSo Ive taken a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformctsjbmr2releaseteststestseffectsrcandroideffectctsGLEnv.java relnofollowtestseffectsrcandroideffectctsGLEnv.javaa to setup the EGL stuff and Ive also grabbed TextureRenderer.java and GLToolbox from the HelloEffects example. Mashed them all up and Ive got the code below.p  pemOn a side note, I have also tried  testsmediasrcandroidmediactsOutputSurface.java to setup the EGL stuff and I got the exact same result.emp  pWhen I run it, the image I get back is just uniformly blue. This corresponds to the glClear I did with the colour blue. This proves at least to some degree that pixels are being rendered to the framebuffer, glReadPixels is seeing those pixels and the bitmap output is working.p  pBut why is the texture not showing up Neither the original nor the effectapplied texture shows up. No GL errors are detected either.p  pIve trimmed down the code to a single file working example that can be copiedpasted into Eclipse and will run. Obviously modify the input and output image paths per your needs.p  pTested on a Nexus 10  Android 4.3 as well as the Emulator.

Negative 64388 pIm using XtraReports 12.2.12 in my lightswitch project. This projects connects to a sql database as datasource.p  pI created a report class and added a query as datasource for the report. Then added a detailreport with the context menu  Insert detail report to a bound list. Suggested by xtrareportsp  pThis bound report actually contains the data of a n to n mapping table with references to the corresponding tables. In the detailreport I try to display the data of one of these tables but receive only empty fields.p  pThe funny thing is  the rowcount of empty rows countable because of the labels I inserted into the report is correct  only the data is missing. I thought maybe the xtrareports component is not able to load the data from the referenced table but even the data from the detail report main table is not shown.p  pMaybe someone could give me a hint on how to solve this.p  pThx in Advancep  pStevep

Kernel Had Supported Driver Check the directory  libmodulesK.net  if you could find rtl8139.o Your kernel had supported RTL8139 series. You could easy use linuxconf to setup your card. If you dont like linuxconf, you also could use modprobe rtl8139 and ifconfig up eth0 to load module. If your driver load properly, your etcconf.modules should include line of alias eth0 rtl8139.p      p2. Kernel Dont Support Driver If your kernel doesnt support RTL8139 series, you should compiler driver by yourself. Please contact www.scyld.comnetworkrtl8139.html to get source code. The compiler command is located on the end of source code. Maybe like gcc DMODULE Wall Wstrictprototypes O6 c rtl8139.c.

Negative 64388 pI am using the terminal application on osX to connect to ubuntu 12.04 i think. I have the terminal at its default setting of xerm256. In this mode the terminal sends the sequence of 033OQ when F2 is pressed. There is no mapping however for ShiftF2 or ControlF2. There is also no sequences set for ShiftLeft, ShiftRight, ControlLeft, ControlRight, etc. I need some of these keys to operate features from time to time in various programs. Take for example byobu. ShiftF2 and ControlF2 are used to split the screen vertically and horizontally. In tmux the arrow keys are used with shift and control for resizing panes.p  pMy problem is that I dont know what sequence the terminal should send. How do I find out what these sequences should be I know that I can press Controlv and then a key to get the code that is being received but this is not what I need. I dont need to see what sequence is being sent. I need to know what sequence I need to send.p  pFor instance my left arrow sends [OD. My ControlLeft sends [[5D]. However my up and down keys have no distinction. My down sends [OB and Controldown also sends [OB. Same problem with my up key. It is the same with or without shift.p  pIs there a list somewhere with all of the keys and there codes, specifically with modifiers such as shift, control, altoptionp  pHow can I find out what the expected sequence is so I can send what is neededp

This product has many of the characteristics of the general current definition of a SPA.p  pIve never quite seen how MVC actually fits in when you start generating all your views with JS view models which get their data from calls to JSON web services.p  pIs there a sweet spot that leverages the best parts of Knockout wJS models and JSON and the MVC frameworkp  pHere are some things that Ive been thinking about this a little random  just seeing if I can spur on some discussionanswersp  ul liWhen would you use Knockout vs. Razor  Knockout generates the view elements at run time on the client browser.  Razor runs as part of the server request before the client receives the response.  Are there times that one is clearly better than the other or does it come down to personal tasteli liIs there value in keeping more code under the guise of CRazor for the purpose of code completion  Also, when exceptions get thrown, stack tracing to compiled code seems easier than JS debugging.li liIs it better to completely separate the view from the backend by creating a blank ASP.NET application and an independent Web API projectli ul

For each tick on the xaxis ie. for a particular value of clients, I can have 3 bars each corresponding to the mean for 10, 50 or 100 connections. How can I achieve this in R p  pP.S I am a newbie to R, so a bit detailed answer would be helpful. If there is a better answer with ggplot, that is also fine.p

So for now I have it inside a ScrollView.pli lipone of the many children of my LinearLayout is a ListView shows 3 items, user scrolls the ListView for more.pli lipYou can image the other children of my LinearLayout to be whatever will convince you that I need this to work for example, one may be a scrollable horizontal LinearLayout another may be a ViewPater etc.pli ul  pNow if the content of my LinearLayout could all fit the screen at once, I would have no problem. But I have about six different children in my LinearLayout and only about three are visible at one time. So, yes, I do need to be able to scroll my LinearLayout.p  pOne more thing. If I am scrolling the child ListView and I reach the end, I need the parent LinearLayout to resume control and start scrolling as user scrolls.p  pstrongCLARIFICATIONstrongp  pOne clarification is that my ListView is actually dynamically added to a ViewPager. So technically, a ViewPager is the child of my LinearLayout. But then inside the ViewPager, one of the pages is a ListView. p  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pBy the way, I have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20227068scrollinglistviewwithinscrollviewscrolling ListView within ScrollViewa. The answer there is good, but I still have a few problems.p  ul liponce edge of ListView is reached control does not revert to ScrollViewpli lipIf any of the other child views of the LinearLayout have a click listener, then I cannot use them to scroll the ScrollView. So basically for most of the screen, the scroll view is not scrollable.pli ul

I only need some kind of queue Put it in there, and try to send it to the server If it worked, dequeue, otherwise try again after a short pause.p  pHow could I implement this Is there something such as RabbitMQ conceptually available for browsers A queue on top of the browsers builtin database Something like thatp  pOr can this issue be solved using PouchDBp
Negative 64388 pI am using a program to generate a report. The program uses an XSL file to generate a PDF report. I am trying to create a custom XSL file.p  pIn my example, I am trying to only generate a report for items that are 3.5 Floppy OR 5.25 Floppy separately. In addition to this, I am trying to fit the results in two column per index card  for printing.p  pIm not an XSL expert, but Ive done a research, and found several possible solutions for what Im trying to achieve mainly a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16353800twocolumntablesusingxsltthis questiona however the final results are always not what I want them to be  I may have a wrong concept

Negative 64388 pIs there an strongapplicationagnosticstrong signaling protocolp  pThe use case is this. We have an opensource library for a multiagent system that supports several protocols of the application layer of the OSI model. On the moment HTTP, XMPP, and ZeroMQ are supported for example. We would like to add highbandwidth realtime streaming possibilities. It is logical to use RTP for that.p  pSo, to recapitulate, we already have a connection to the other party that we can use for signalling. We want to negotiate only a new channel for data communication.p  pHowever, regarding the current standards, with respect to signaling all of them seem to be tied to their application. These current standards seem to be SIP, RTSP, and Jingle. They all seem to use RTP or SRTP on the application layer, and UDP on the transport layer. See e.g. a hrefhttpxmpp.orgextensionsxep0167.html relnofollow titleXEP0167XEP0167a. p  pThe only thing we want to negotiate is another connection to that party that can be used for data transmission. In the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSessionDescriptionProtocol relnofollowSession Description Protocola all kind of stuff about media shows up, optional phone numbers, etc. If someone can point at a signaling protocol that is meant to be applicationagnostic, that would be great p

Negative 64388 pI am building a web application in Node.js, and using Socket.IO to handle data transfer between my client and server sides.p  pThe core piece of my web application is a content feed. My clientside Javascript emits a Socket.IO call for the contents of the newsfeed.

In fact, under this reasoning, due to the fact that lines from different files may be requested simultaneously, the read head may need to move significantly from time to time, causing the multiproc approach to be slower than a serial approach. So I decided to go back to a single process to read my logfiles.p  pInterestingly though, I noticed that I did get a speedup with small files lt 40KB, and that it was only with large files  445MB that the expected slowdown was noticed.p  pThis leads me to believe that python may read files in chunks, whose size exceeds more than the one line I request at a time.p  pstrongQ1strong So what is the strongfilereading mechanismstrong under the hoodp  pstrongQ2strong What is the best way to optimize the reading of files from a strongconventional HDDstrongp  pTechnical specsp  ul lipython3.3li li5400rpm conventional HDDli liMac OSX 10.9.2 Mavericksli ul

Negative 64388 pI have a new profile form that has multiple required fields, email, password and confirm password. The submit button is set to be disabled if the form is in invalid state.

If it is alone in valid state, submit button gets activated, regardless of states of other fields. I am using angular 1.0.7.

Will using Git to download jQuery this way work with submodules  Are there benefits to install this way, or should I just stick with my  trued and proven version of manually downloading a zipp  pEDIT.  After checking out 1.11.1, I see the jQuery file in the dist directory.  1.2.6 puts it in the root directory.p  pBased on the above, will this same approach work with jQueryUIp  pThank youp

Negative 64388 pI wondered if someone could help. We use Google Apps for Education. Within the system we have a shared folder where teachers can place files for students to access. E.g. The entire team of 8 science teachers all add files to Science Shared. p  pScience Shared folder is on a separate google account scienceshareddomain.comp  pOver time, files will take up quota of individual users and if they leave and their account is deleted, all these files will go. We obviously do not want to transfer their entire data to scienceshared using the transfer facility.p  pIdeally, I am looking for some sort of script which can traverse through the shared folder and change the permissions of each file and folder so that scienceshared is the owner and the individual teacher has edit access.p  pIs this possible and if so, can anyone provide some help on howwhere to start...clueless at the moment.p  pThanks in advance.p

So it appears the original integer is now lost due to the conversion that occurred when writing to the table. Is there any way to get the original integer back after converting it to a timestampp

Negative 64388 pI am very new to using Apache VFS. Is there a good example or documentation about writing a new VFS providerp  pMy use case is that I have metadata about files in a MySQL database, with the actual files stored in an object storage system. My goal to to build a virtual directory tree based on the metadata in the database, and upon download stream and process onthefly the files directly from the object store.p  pThe framework in which I intend to use the VFS is an Apache Mina FTP server with the VFS Utils FTP Bridge as File System. If I understand it correctly all that is missing now is the proper VFS provider to build the virtual directory structure and connect to the file this is intended for downloads only.p  pI think I understand the basic structure of VFS, but at this point I dont really know which components I have to implement to get it to work or even where to start.p

Negative 64388 pI do know how to Open, Read, Write and Close a serial port using MFCC.

I am ready to learn and I am not asking for direct answers.p  pI hope my fellow programming seniors in Stack Overflow can help me out here.p  pMany thanks.p
Negative 64388 pI have an app listening for changes in a Dropbox account using the Sync API. I have registered the path listener using DbxFileSystem.addPathListener and I create an Android notification when onPathChange is triggered. This works well while the app is on the screen and when the app is closed and other apps are running. It also works if I lock my device and the screen is off. However after a while I assume when the phone goes into sleep mode or when the device is rebooted the listener seems to not be registered anymore. If I then go into my app a notfication will be sent of changes that have occured in the folder, so the listener is reregistered again. p  pI am hoping someone could provide a clear direction of how to keep the listener registered all the time. I have done some googling about services and broadcastReceivers but I havent been able to work out the answerp  pthanksp
Negative 64388 pI have a 2D image of 512x512 pixels that I would like to rotate with a certain angle at a certain origin rotation center. All this time, I uses Scipy to rotate images with its rotate method. But, I got stumbled because the rotation always done around the center of the image. With 512x512 pixels the rotation center should be around point x,y 128,128. How can I rotate the image with a custom rotation center, lets say around x,y 20,128   p
Negative 64388 pI am developing an app that is going to be something like camscanner. In my app i have an camera api tha i call.

When the AltBeacon scan is running the wifi internet dont work, so i cant request info from internet when an AltBeacon was detected. I did tried it on Moto G, Moto X and Sony Xperia SP.and Sony Xperia z1,Sony Xperia z and Samsung smcore2 , xolo q1100 p  pAnother problem is when the scan is running on Android background, i need run this scan all the time to detect new AltBeacons That make the application pretty unstable, maybe because it uses a lot of phone process and memory. Somebody have any information or case about AltBeacons Scan on Android background modep  pThanksp
Negative 64388 pSo I have a camera with a wide angle lens. I know the distortion coefficients, the focal length, the optical center. I want to undistort the image I get from this camera. I used OpenCV for the first try cvundistort, which worked well, but was way too slow.p  pNow I want to do this on the gpu. There is a shader doing exactly this documented in a hrefhttpwillsteptoe.compost67401705548arriftaligningtrackingandvideospacespart5 relnofollowhttpwillsteptoe.compost67401705548arriftaligningtrackingandvideospacespart5a p  pthe formulas can be seen here a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDistortion28optics29Softwarecorrection relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDistortion28optics29Softwarecorrectionap  pSo I went and implemented my own version as a glsl shader. I am sending a quad with texture coordinates on the corners between 0..1.  I assume the texture coordinates that arrive are the coordinates of the undistorted image. I calculate the coordinates for the distorted point corresponding to my texture coordinates. Then I sample the distorted image texture. p  pWith this shader emnothingem in the final image changes. The problem I identified through a cpu implementation is, the coefficient term is very close to zero. The numbers get smaller and smaller through radius squaring etc.. So I have a scaling problem  I cant figure it out what to do differently I tried everything... I guess it is something quite obvious, since this kind of process seems to work for a lot of people.p  pI left out the tangential distortion correction for simplicity.p  precodeversion 330 core  in vec2 UV  out vec4 color  uniform sampler2D textureSampler  void main         vec2 focalLength  vec2438.568f, 437.699f     vec2 opticalCenter  vec2667.724f, 500.059f     vec4 distortionCoefficients  vec40.035109f, 0.002393f, 0.000335f, 0.000449f      const vec2 imageSize  vec21280.f, 960.f      vec2 opticalCenterUV  opticalCenter  imageSize      vec2 shiftedUVCoordinates  UV  opticalCenterUV      vec2 lensCoordinates  shiftedUVCoordinates  focalLength      float radiusSquared  sqrtdotlensCoordinates, lensCoordinates     float radiusQuadrupled  radiusSquared  radiusSquared      float coefficientTerm  distortionCoefficients.x  radiusSquared  distortionCoefficients.y  radiusQuadrupled      vec2 distortedUV  lensCoordinates  lensCoordinates  coefficientTerm  focalLength      vec2 resultUV  distortedUV  opticalCenterUV      color  texture2DtextureSampler, resultUV  codepre

Im a person who always looks for logic...and we all know in webdeveloping, there is not much or none at all. p  pIm looking for something simple, very simple.  A header image that is responsive.

Negative 64388 pI am attempting to integrate a simple map for displaying gps information into a larger ios app. The map should also be available offline.br Prerequisites and what I already know  p  ul liApple does not offer an API for offline mapsli liI cannot use OpenStreetMaps, Mapbox, etc. due to licensing issues  li ul  pAt the moment I am using MKSnapshotter to create a screenshot of the map needed and am drawing on the screenshot. This works fine, however it takes a while for the screenshot to be made and the mapkit api is very comfortable, etc.  p  pOne thing I did notice however, is that MapKit caches quite alot of its Map even after closing the application, turning the device off and on, etc., which means that conceivably I could lock zoom, scroll, etc. when the user plans to go offline. This brings me to the question in the title  p  pHow reliable is MKMapView cachingbr For how long can I expect it to keep its cache  p

I can then simply use Analyse  Measure to gain measurements from the defined ROI.p  pHowever, when I split an RGB image by channel Image  Colour  Split Channels and attempt to threshold one of the resultant 8bit images, the threshold dialogue does not provide me with the option to select the thresholded pixels as a ROI only the options Auto, Apply, Reset and Set are now available, and not Select.p  pIve notice that converting the image type from 8bit to RGB colour Image  Type  RGB Colour allows me to use the Select option once more at the threshold dialogue, whilst keeping the image in grayscale and without appearing to change pixel intensity.p  pIs there a more logical manner to select thresholded pixels as a ROI in a 8bit image Or is the best option just the seemingly superfluous step of splitting channels followed by converting the 8bit image to a RGB colour imagep  pThank youp

Negative 64388 pI have been using the highly concise and intuitive C syntax for finding the intersection of two sorted codevectorcodes and putting the result in a third codevectorcodep  precodevectorltbargt a,b,c ... stdsetintersectiona.begin,a.end,b.begin,b.end,                       stdbackinserterc codepre  pThis should set codeccode to intersectioncodeacode,codebcode, assuming codeacode and codebcode are sorted.p  pBut what if I just use codec.begincode I thought I saw an example somewhere of this, which is why I didp  precode stdsetintersectiona.begin,a.end,b.begin,b.end,                        c.begin codepre  pcodesetintersectioncode expects an codeOutputIteratorcode at that parameter. The standard I believe requires only that codec.begincode return a codeforward iteratorcode, which I suppose might or might not be an codeOutputIteratorcode.p  pAnyway, the code with codec.begincode compiled under clang. p  pWhat is guaranteed to happen under the standard If this compiles, what is likely to happen  that is, when the iterator returned by codec.begincode is eventually incremented past the end of the vector, and an attempt is made to access the element pointed to, what mustmay happen Can a conforming implementation silently extend the vector in this case, so that codebegincode is in fact an appending codeOutputIteratorcode like codebackinsertercode isp  pIm asking this mainly to understand how the standard works with iterators whats really going on, so I can move beyond copyandpaste in using the STL.p
Negative 64388 pI have a strange problem. I have a toolStripMenuItem that I wish to have the first letter underlined.  This is in Windows Forms VS 2010. It is defined in the designer with text equal to ampExpand and show shortcut keys  true and shortcut keys  AltE.  It shows up in the form in designer as expected with the E underlined. I have a click event that changes the name, and then does something.  If you click again it sets the name backp  precode    private void expandToolStripMenuItemClickobject sender, EventArgs e              if expandToolStripMenuItem.Text  ampExpand                      expandToolStripMenuItem.Text  Collapsampe             expandToolStripMenuItem.ShortcutKeys  Keys.Alt  Keys.E              execute some other code                   else                      expandToolStripMenuItem.Text  ampExpand             expandToolStripMenuItem.ShortcutKeys  Keys.Alt  Keys.E                codepre  pI also set the ampExpand in the form shown and load events although this makes no difference. Now when the form opens the E is not underlined.  If I click it with the mouse it shows Collapse but the e is not underlined.  I can go back and forth with the mouse and the letters are never underlined.  However if I type AltE, the letter is underlined in both cases from that point on.  Even with the mouse. Any ideas Thanksp

Negative 64388 pWhile trying to follow the Wordpress for GAE starter project a hrefhttpsgooglecloudplatform.github.ioappenginephpwordpressstarterproject relnofollowhttpsgooglecloudplatform.github.ioappenginephpwordpressstarterprojecta I ran into the 10.000 files limit with some plugins I installed very fast. Actually with only 7793 files in my project I am very close to the 10.000 files limit and adding any other more complex plugin overruns the limits. I presume that this is because of compilation of the PHP in the transfer process.p  pAs a result, more complex wordpress websites are not doable. It would be good if all noncode files could be automatically put, but also found on Cloud Storage. This would also allow translations mo,pofiles to be updated after uploading to GAE, and the addition of revslider files, without a complete redeployment with the risk of overruning the 10.000 files limit again. Of course, it would also help if the 10.000 files limit quota could be relaxed. p

Negative 64388 pI have been looking at several threads on SO and on google that says that i could use lineheight after setting the height of the div to make the text align vertically. This however requires that you set the height of the div which cant be good for a responsive web design  Im trying to align a single line of text in a navigation bar.p  pSome sample codep  precodeltnavgt   ltsection classlogogt     ltspangtlogo textltspangt   ltsectiongt   ltsectiongt     ltulgt       ltligtlinkltligt       ltligtlinkltligt       ltligtlinkltligt       ltligtlinkltligt     ltulgt   ltsectiongt   ltsection classdropdowngt     ltspangtdropdownltspangt   ltsectiongt ltnavgt  .logo    display inlineblock   .dropdown    display inlineblock  codepre  pI need to align the logo and dropdown text inside the span elements, but i dont have any height set anywhere because I want the design to adapt to the screen resolution more easily.p  pThe span is inside a nav element so i thought i could do height 100 on the span if i set it to an inlineblock element but that did not work.p  pIs there any way to get lineheight to work with height without manually specifying the height for the span in pixels so i can get a vertically aligned text which is as responsive as possible p  pI have been looking at using the verticalalign property with css tables as well, but it looks like i also in that case have to specify the height of the container element in pixels.p

Negative 64388 pI need a function be called exactly 256 timer every second in my driver kernel module. I was using RTC, and it was working perfectly. But because of the need to have hwclock command and interrupt sharing issue, I had to use another way to have a timer. So I tried to use hrtimer. I works almost almost good in a hardware configuration.p  pBut whenever I install the driver on another machine with a different hardware, the hrtimer doesnt work good anymore, ie the timer function is called 230 times per second instead of 256 times per second.

Negative 64388 pWhen scheduling a task in Quartz, you have the ability to set misfires and rescheduling. This could be used in the example scenario whereby there is a job that runs every 30 mins, and potentially there could be a backlog and and the job would execute for longer than 30 mins. To prevent the same job running twice you could use the codeDisallowConcurrentExecutioncode. Once complete the job would then execute the second instance that is queued by using codesimpleSchedule.withMisfireHandlingInstructionNowWithExistingCountcode.p  pNow in Spring Scheduler there doesnt appear to be this fine grained ability, with just the codefixedratecode and codefixeddelaycode options to schedule it every 30 mins or wait 30 mins after the previous job completed.

Negative 64388 pWe are in the planning stages for a new multitenant SaaS app and have hit a deciding point. When designing a multitenant application, is it better to go for one monolithic database that holds all customer data Using a customerid column or is it better to have an independent database per customer Regardless of the database decisions, all tenants will run off of the same codebase.p  pIt seems to me that having separate databases makes backups  restorations MUCH easier, but at the cost of increased complexity in development and upgrades Much easier to upgrade 1 database vs 500. It also is easier  possible to split individual customers off to separate dedicated servers if the situation warrants the move. At the same time, aggregating data becomes much more difficult when trying to get a broad overview of how customers are using the software.p  pWe expect to have less than 250 customers for at least a year after launch, but they will be large customers and more will follow afterward. p  pAs this is our first leap into SaaS, we are definitely looking to do this right from the start.p

Negative 64388 pThis question might go unanswered because it deals with a certain brand of software from Data Device Corporation DDC.p  pIm trying to run a C program in Microsoft Visual C 2010 Express and Im getting errors.  p  pDDC provided some software in a folder called  BU69092S03215. p  pIn that folder there was a setup application which I ran.  The setup applicaton created a folder called DDC.  p  pInside the DDC folder was another folder called aceXtremeSDKv3215.  In this folder there is a Samples folder which has the samples available to run.  p  pIm unable to run any of these samples in Visual Studios.  I was initially trying to run the bcasync2 solution first but could not get it to work.  I then began to try other samples but all have the same error.  p  pWhat happensp  pI start Visual Studios, and then I go to OpenProjectSolution.   p  pThen I navigate to a sample such as bcasync2 and I click Open.  p  pI get a warning which reads  codeCDDCaceXtremeSDKv3215Samplesbcasync2BCAsync2.vcxproj  warning   Platform x64 referenced in the project file SBcAsync2 cannot be found.

Negative 64388 pIam working on an android application and have trouble making a decision for the architecture saving application data. Following casep  pIn the app the user has the possibility to create new general objects and give them properties he want. To support this, i want to give them a list with favorites before creating the input form, for example a car. It has color, weight, speed, horsepower etc. So the user can choose a often picked object for example the car and will get the appropriate fields for the form he has to fill color, weigth .... This list should be smart. The more you pick an item, the higher it appears in the list. And this presets have to be editable in preferences.p  pAnd thats the point. Should I implement my idea with the preferences framework from android save it to xml as different preferences types and simply load due preferencebuilder or should i create own xml objects and save it to self created user file locationp  pMy second question if i use the preference framework method .... is this made good for dynamically add entries at runtime the ressources are in the res folder, but what if there are individual user entries will they also be saved in the program folder or is there a special user data folder where the files maybe encrypted are inp  pThank youp

Negative 64388 pI have a .NET Winforms application MVP pattern. I have a feature wherein a user can save a content into hisher local directory. Here are the two approach for implementationp  ol liClick the button, pop a save dialog, and when user clicks save, display loading, then call the function that generates the content and saves it on the path chosen, close the loading afterwards.li liClick the button, display loading, call the function that generates the content, persist the generated content, close the loading, pop a save dialog and when the user clicks save, save the content on the path chosen.li ol  h11 Pro In contrast to 2, I dont have to persist the generated content, because I am able to save the file right away upon generating it.h1  h11 Con After clicking save, there is a loading time during the generation and saving of the content. It feels unnatural on UX.h1  h12 Pro Expected to have minimal to no loading time when the user clicks on save, because the content is already ready.h1  h12 Con I have to persist the generated content until the user clicks on save, since I am going back to the View to pop the save dialog, the content must be persisted, I think a big bulk of content seems weird to carry across MVP.h1  pI am inclined to 2, especially if there is another way to persist the content or implement the generate content first then save dialog.p

Negative 64388 pI am attempting to create my first prepared statement. With this I am also trying to send my first image file to be moved into my database. I have been working on this for a month or so and cannot get this to work. I initially was trying to do this with a simple insert command with php and everything was inserting into my db except for the name of the img file. I was told numerous times to create this with a prepared statement, so I am doing that, but nothing is sending to my data base and I cannot figure out why.p  pI start my code with validation for some of the data fields. I am not validating the img file yet, but will later. The validation is not the issue as I broke this down a bit and it is passing through it.p  pI do not have any errors that are occurring. I even put in something that would generate any syntax errors when executing the statement, but that does not generate any errors.p  pDoes any one see what Im doing wrong here that would cause this to not send Does it have to do with my img file or am I doing the prepared statement incorrectlyp  precodeifvalidationgtpassed          ifissetPOST[create]              productid  trim POST[productid]              name  trim POST[name]              price  trim POST[price]              saleprice  trim POST[saleprice]              finalprice  trim POST[finalprice]              shippingprice  trim POST[shippingprice]              category  trim POST[category]              itemdetails  trim POST[itemdetails]              itemdetails2  trim POST[itemdetails2]              description  trim POST[description]              viewproducttype  trim POST[viewproducttype]              file  productpics.

Negative 64388 pim not a JavaNewbie but I cant get my head around a problem occured recently.p  pI have to simulate a road system in Java. For sake of proper OOP, Ive got a class Car and a class Street and several others to manage the whole simulation of course. I already managed to simulate a jam on one road and have had no problem doing so.p  pOK, here comes the Question I want to extend my simulation from one lonely street to a road system. So i thought of a class called something like RoadSystem which might have an array of streets and some sort of connection I thought of knots allowing cars to know where they can drive as they reach the end of the street they are driving on.p  pThe problem is that I have no idea how to implement these knots. The car has to be able to ask the street hey bro, Im at the end of you, where can I drive now and the street should somehow know which knot has a reference to it and ask it for the streets that are also connected to this particular knot. How do I do this reference I thought of an ID but this might get extremely slow for bigger road systems if the street has to search through the streetIDs of every knot in order to find its own ID there. Or am I missing an obvious solution to my problemp  pEvery help highly appreciatedp  pGreetings from Germany,p  pRuffyp

Negative 64388 pI need to parse a table of numbers formatted as ascii text.  There are 36 space delimited signed integers per line of text and about 3000 lines in the file.  The input file is generated by me in Matlab so I could modify the format.  On the other hand, I also want to be able to parse the same file in VHDL and so ascii text is about the only format possible.p  pSo far, I have a little program like this that can loop through all the lines of the input file.  I just havent found a way to get individual numbers out of the line. I am not a C purest. I would consider fscanf but 36 numbers is a bit much for that.

Negative 64388 pI have recently started learning Logic Designs and I have a few things that I dont quite understand.p  pLets say you are given a certain value in seconds say 3,000,000, and are asked to convert to weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds Mixed Radix. How would you convert it I tried dividing the value with 60 first for seconds, Used the quotient  as the first number, then divided the remainder again with 60 this time for number of minutes and so on for each radix 60s, 60m, 24h, 7d, 52w. Is this how you are supposed to solve itp  pI also would like to know how to find the maximum value that can be represented by x vectors eg. 4 with a radix eg. 6. I thought it would be the sum of the value for each vector place 216, 36, 6, 1, thus being 259. But I dont think its correct.p  pIve tried finding any help online but couldnt find any that gave an easy explanation.p

Negative 64388 pSo I believe that I understand this code. I was prompted in codewars to return the duplicate in the provided array. This is what I came up with after some searching. I am very new to Ruby and would like to thoroughly understand this piece of code rather than just using it to pass the code challenge. p  pCorrect me if I am wrong, or add anything I am missing...p  ul liemarrem is the array.li liem.detectem is a method that passes each entry in the enum through a block. it then returns the first for which the block is not false.li lipin this case, it passes it throughp  precodee arr.rindexe  arr.indexe   codepreli lipthe process of this block is that emeem represents each entry in the enum.pli liem.rindexeem searches from the last to first emeem in the array and returns the matching array object described in the argument emem portion of the code. li liem.indexeem returns the first object in the array that is true. li ul  pSo, to wrap this all up, .rindex checks starting from the end of the array for the first true object, while em.indexem does the same but from the start of the array until they hit the number that makes em.rindexem and em.indexem false. Since the block itself is true arr.rindexe is not equal to arr.indexe, detect returns the object that is a duplicate.p  precode    arr.detect e arr.rindexe  arr.indexe  codepre  pThis all still feels very high level to me and it would be beneficial for someone to break this down a bit better for me.

Negative 64388 pI have my own implementation of TrackRenderer for a mp3 decoder, that I integrated. When a lollipop device goes to standby and comes back, its not always repeatable but the audio starts to stutter until I force stop the application.p  pIn the beginning, I thought it was the decoder I implemented, so I tried comparing the file output between a stuttering track to a normal one. The files are identical, I then thought maybe its taking too long to decode, so I increased the buffer size and called setPlayReady false, in order for the data to buffer. It stutters the same as if I didnt pause. I am currently thinking the issue is with either my implementation of audio track or an OS bug. The bug only happens on Lollipop devices.p  pThanks.p  pMy TrackRenderer uses the same work flow as a hrefhttpsgithub.comgoogleExoPlayerblobb3bf8fea20c1e82abef9a9a2699b3d7147672dd3extensionsopussrcmainjavacomgoogleandroidexoplayerextopusLibopusAudioTrackRenderer.java relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgoogleExoPlayerblobb3bf8fea20c1e82abef9a9a2699b3d7147672dd3extensionsopussrcmainjavacomgoogleandroidexoplayerextopusLibopusAudioTrackRenderer.javaap  pwith my own native implementation for the decoder for mp3 and not opus.p

Negative 64388 pIm trying to figure out what would be the shortest and simplest way to lazily load tooltips with PHPgenerated contents inside. Ive found a pretty solid library called PowerTip which Ive been trying to appropriate however there are some difficulties there.p  pSo Im going to have a block of text and positioning a cursor over any word longer than three characters in that text should invoke a PHP script passing that word as a parameter, reading the response which is plain html and passing it inside the tooltip contents. When a user hovers over some word theyd get a nicely formatted tooltip which is specifically related to that word.p  pIm looking to have a clean and easily maintainable HTML code that allows me to have as little javascript in different places as possible and preferably without duplicating the texts contents elsewhere and the tooltip should look good not just a regular  kind of a tooltip and follow cursor.

Both times i started from a hrefhttpswww.ffmpeg.orgdoxygentrunktranscoding8cexample.html relnofollowthisa example and modified it in order to works as I described before. And it works perfectly now D The only error i could find in the old code posted before is when i try to access to the video stream in the output file I used codevideoStreamIndexcode, but that index is from the video stream in the input file. Some times it could be the same index and some times not. But it doesnt explain why it crashed randomly. If that was the reason of the crash, it should crash every time i ran the code with the same video. So probably, there are more errors in that code. strongNotice that ive not tested if fixing that error in the code above actually solve the crashing problemsstrong.p
Negative 64388 pI have developed my own little grid css framework which you can find at a hrefhttptitan.ravenwebdesign.nl relnofollowTitan gridap  pIts a 12 column grid that works by dividing 100 by the amount of columns and removing the leftmargin on each column. p  pfor example if the gutter width is 1p  precodewidth 100  1  12  12  1 codepre  pBecause the columns all have left margin. The first column needs to have its marginleft removed for the columns in a row to take up 100 in the container.p  pThis is done by simply selecting the firstchild of a rowfirst column and removing its margin. This system works fine but it runs into problems when for example I want a mobile version where I suddenly change a 4 column row into a row where I want 2 columns next to eachother.p  precodeltdiv class rowgt     ltdiv classcolumn3gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcolumn3gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcolumn3gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcolumn3gtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAs you can see with the example above when I would change the columns to be 2 columns next to eachother for a mobile website the third column3 wouldnt get the margin removed since its not a firstchild anymore. So this system is a bit flawed.p  pI decided to remake my grid and work without marginleft. when Im using 4 columns I simply divide 100 by 4 now and end up with 25 columns. Inside the columns Ive put an item class with a margin so backgrounds dont touch. p  precodemargin 16px 0 0 16px codepre  pSince every column now has a marginleft inside them this needs to be offset because my container is now always off center. I do this by using positioningp  precodeposition relative  pull the container aside half the gutterwidth  left 8px codepre  pI think this is a pretty elegant solution to grid problems. My question is will this all work properly this way, or do you see problems with this approach in the future The downside to all this is ofcourse adding an extra item div inside the columns.p  pCodepen for the updated gridp  pa hrefhttpcodepen.iostephanvpeneNXeOW relnofollowhttpcodepen.iostephanvpeneNXeOWap

Negative 64388 pIm trying to set up a emUICollectionViewem with a emUICollectionViewFlowLayoutem with the following requirement the emminimumLineSpacingem should always be exactly onethird of the height of the emUICollectionViewem. My initial thought was to override emviewDidLayoutSubviewsem like thisp  precodeoverride func viewDidLayoutSubviews      super.viewDidLayoutSubviews      collectionViewFlowLayout.minimumLineSpacing  collectionView.frame.height  3     collectionViewFlowLayout.invalidateLayout  codepre  pNote that I use emviewDidLayoutSubviewsem because Im planning to use Auto Layout and the frame may depend on some complex constraints. So I cant calculate the frame myself but have to wait until Auto Layout calculated it for me to use in emviewDidLayoutSubviewsem.p  pI tested this a bit by creating a emUICollectionViewem programmatically and rotating the simulator to see if the emminimumLineSpacingem is always correct. It seemed to work just fine.p  pThen, I switched to Auto Layout. I simply constrained the collection views top, bottom, leading and trailing space to its superview. After doing so, setting the emminimumLineSpacingem didnt have the intended effect anymore, it simply didnt change anything about the appearance of the collection view.p  pThe following code nicely demonstrates the issue. As soon as I set codeuseAutoLayoutcode to codetruecode, setting the emminimumLineSpacingem doesnt work anymore.p  precodeclass DemoViewController UIViewController, UICollectionViewDataSource       var collectionView UICollectionView      var collectionViewFlowLayout UICollectionViewFlowLayout       MARK  UIViewController      override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad          collectionViewFlowLayout  UICollectionViewFlowLayout         collectionViewFlowLayout.itemSize  CGSizeMake100, 100          collectionView  UICollectionViewframe view.frame, collectionViewLayout collectionViewFlowLayout         collectionView.registerClassUICollectionViewCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier cell         collectionView.dataSource  self          view.addSubviewcollectionView          let useAutoLayout  false  Change this to true to test          if useAutoLayout              collectionView.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsfalse              NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraintsNSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatV[collectionView], options nil, metrics nil, views [collectionView  collectionView]             NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraintsNSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatH[collectionView], options nil, metrics nil, views [collectionView  collectionView]          else              collectionView.autoresizingMask  .FlexibleHeight  .FlexibleWidth                    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews          super.viewDidLayoutSubviews          collectionViewFlowLayout.minimumLineSpacing  collectionView.frame.height  3         collectionViewFlowLayout.invalidateLayout            MARK  ltUICollectionViewDataSourcegt      func numberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView gt Int          return 1           func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section Int gt Int          return 100           func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UICollectionViewCell          let cell  collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifiercell, forIndexPath indexPath as UICollectionViewCell          cell.backgroundColor  UIColor.greenColor          return cell        codepre  pTest this code in the Simulator, rotate it and see how setting the emminimumLineSpacingem doesnt do anything when codeuseAutoLayoutcode is set to codetruecode.

Negative 64388 pI have a website under version control using GIT. I have a system set up that essentially, automatically deploys changes in my codemastercode branch to my production server. Namely, I have a webhook in my repository that triggers a PHP script that essentially initiates a codegit pullcode on the server in order to pull down changes.p  pMy issue lies in the fact that I currently have a configuration file codeconfig.phpcode that is tracked using git. Myself and another developer want to have our own codeconfig.phpcode files that are different to the file on the server, therefore we want to tell git to stop tracking this file and just pretend it isnt there.p  pWe decided first to test using a less important file, so we added codetest.phpcode to our code.gitignorecode file, hoping this would do the trick. Git was still tracking the file so I tried running codegit rm cached test.phpcode in an attempt to stop tracking the file. This seemed to work so we committed and pushed our changes.p  pTo my surprise, when our deployment script initiated the pull on our server we found that this file had been deleted from production. Thanksfully, the deleted codetest.phpcode was not important.p  pstrongTLDRstrong How can I tell git to ignore a file it currently tracks, have it untracked and deleted from my repository, but leave it intact on my production serverp

Negative 64388 pI was creating a windows UWP application, Where I required some encryption of strings and inserting it into the azure table. I tried using codeDataProtectionProvider.ProtectAsynccode method, which works fine except the encrypted string happens to become very large. I wanted a encryption where I can specify the length of the encrypted string. Or what are my alternatives here p  pThe operation Im looking for is something of this sortp  precodestring encryptedText  encryptPlainTextplainText, password, encryptedTextSize codepre  pEdit My requirements are I was trying to create something along the lines of a toDo app. I am using Azure Mobile Service with its Sync FrameWork just to be safe I wanted to use encryption on the data. But I know we can only save 64Kb of data in a single column hence I didnt want the encryption to take up most of that space. What are my optionsp

Negative 64388 pI run a website for a youth sports program that features schedules, standings, and score reporting using simple PHP scripts that manipulate data stored in a MySQL database.p  pAfter a game is played, the winning coach will access the score reporting form for that particular game, enter the information, and click submit to update the schedule and standings accordingly.  They are then automatically redirected to the schedule page that they came from.p  pHowever, several times a season, a coach will unintentionally duplicate a score submission sometimes creating as many as three or four instances which does not affect the result posted on the schedule, but does throw the data in the standings out of whack.  Im not sure how exactly this is being accomplished, but Im trying to fix the problem.p  pIve been reading up as much as possible on here and the web and believe that I need to implement some sort of token system to the reporting script, but Im unsure how to exactly write the code  Any advice here would be GREATLY appreciated.
