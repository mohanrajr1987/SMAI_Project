Positive 601 pI have an web app that is supposed to scan any given site for metrics and send the report as an email. I fetch site url and email id from form and send it to controller action. Then in the action method, I want to run a system command in ubuntu to start the website scan and return the output to the method once done. I want to achieve the running of system command using laravel scheduler as using exec command doesnt work as expected. If the command takes more time to execute then I get connection reset error. hence I wanted to schedule this task as cron job so that the execution can take its own time to complete and once completed, I can call another controller action to send the results to an email. Can someone help how to achieve this using laravel task scheduler.p

Positive 601 pOkay, so I am new to scheduled task and cron methods, but I cannot figure out why a scheduled task that I have configured in the applicationcontext.xml file of my application is not inserting into a certain database table. The schedule task carries out several processes by calling several methods, which take slightly longer than I would like, so I have it running at midnight every day. I configured this with using a cron pattern cron0 0 0   . The method inserts into 4 different tables when it executes entirely. The first inserts a record into a specific table, which is then used as a FK for the second insertion, and so on. However, when the cron runs, the first insertion makes it, but the second insertion does not. I am currently logging the primary key IDs of the records inserted as this task executes, and I notice the second insertion returns a NULL primary key ID.p  pI am using Spring MVC and have created a controller method that allows me to run the strongsame exact codestrong that the cron method runs for testing purposes. When I deploy my application and execute this logic using the URL, my controller method picks up the request and executes everything accordingly, and strongALLstrong insertions to strongALLstrong tables take place. There are NO NULL Ids returned and all tables are updated as expected. But when I let the cron wake up and run this same exact code, not all insertions are successful, and I am not sure why this is happening.  p  pThe logs show up like this when executing the method using the urlp  precode20150923 103244,251 [httpbio8080exec6] DEBUG...

Negative 601 pThe docs say that calling sys.exit raises a SystemExit exception which can be caught in outer levels.  I have a situation in which I want to definitively and unquestionably exit from inside a test case, however the unittest module catches SystemExit and prevents the exit.  This is normally great, but the specific situation I am trying to handle is one where our test framework has detected that it is configured to point to a nontest database.  In this case I want to exit and prevent any further tests from being run.  Of course since unittest traps the SystemExit and continues happily on its way, it is thwarting me.p  pThe only option I have thought of so far is using ctypes or something similar to call   exit3 directly but this seems like a pretty fugly hack for something that should be really simple.p

Negative 601 pI am in the process of writing an application that will need multiple forms of authentication.p  pThe application will need to support authentication to Active Directory, but be able to fail back to a SQL Membership Provider if the user is not in Active Directory.  We can handle the failing to the SQL Provider in code based on the username provided because the username will be a different format than the Active Directory username.p  pIs this even possible  What I mean is, can I use membership and use both ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider and SqlMembershipProvider together or will I have to roll my ownp  pAnother additional added complexity is that I would like to automatically authenticate my internal users based of Windows Authentication back to AD, but use Forms Authentication for users not on our internal network, or users that are using the SQL Provider.p  pThese will most likely be separate servers, one internal, and the other external so I have a lot of planning to do to figure out the data replication, and how I will authenticate the AD users if they hit the outside server etc. p  pI am wondering what thoughts are out there as I start down this road.  Is what I am wanting to do even possible without me rolling my own, or is there a way to mesh these togetherp  hr  pThanks for the reply.  p  pThe reason I asked originally was because I was able to get this specific senerio working about 7 years ago using IIS to authenticate and then passing back the credentials to a Lotus Domino Server Web App.  If the user was not authenticated via the Windows AuthenticationISS then Domino would handle the authentication.  This was what I was looking to do here, but really couldnt think of a way to make it work in IIS.p  pAs for the rest of your reply, I think you are on to the way that I will need to take.  I have thought this through and tossed it around in my head a lot.  The application will be somewhat different on the two servers anyway since there is going to be limited access to the data on the external server anyway.  The fact that so much is going to be different already I may just treat these as two applications, thus negating the need to use two types of authentication in the same application anyway.p  pI am playing around with the idea already of writing my own authenticationlogin window for the external server, and if the user trys to log in with their AD credentials on the external server I will be able to detect that and redirect them to the internal server.  If they are not  on the local network or VPNd in they will simply not get access.  This part still has some thought process to go though so I am not sure.p  pAs an additional thought  is there a way to pull just enough of AD into a SQL database to allow me to authenticate users to the SQL database from the external server using their AD credentials, without creating any security issues  I hope I am clearly typing what I am thinking....p  pThanks againp  pTimp

Negative 601 pFile systems are volatile.  This means that you cant trust the result of one operation to still be valid for the next one, even if its the next line of code.  You cant just say codeif some file exists and I have permissions for it open the filecode, and you cant say codeif some file does not exist create the filecode.  There is always the possibility that the result of your codeifcode condition will emchangeem in between the two parts of your code.  The operations are distinct not atomic.p  pTo make matters worse, the nature of the problem means that if youre tempted to make this check, odds are youre already worried or aware that something you dont control is likely to happen to the file.  The nature of development environments make this event less likely to happen during your testing and very difficult to reproduce.  So not only do you have a bug, but the bug wont show up while testing. p  pTherefore under normal circumstances the best course of action is to not even try to check if a file or directory exists.  Instead, put your development time into handling exceptions from the file system. You have to handle these exceptions anyway, so this is a much better use of your resources. Even though exceptions are slow, checking the existence of a file requires an extra trip to disk, and disk access is emmuchem slower. I even have a wellvoted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions265953chowcanyoueasilycheckifaccessisdeniedforafile265958265958answera to this effect in another question. p  pBut Im having some doubts.  In .Net, for example, if thats really emalwaysem true, the code.Existscode methods wouldnt be in the API in the first place.  Also consider scenarios where you emexpectem your program to need to the create file.  The first example that comes to mind is for a desktop application.  This application installs a default userconfig file to its home directory, and the first time each user starts the application it copies this file to that users application data folder.  It expects the file not to exist on that first startup. p  pSo when is it acceptable to check in advance for the existence or other attributes, like size and permissions of a file  Is expecting failure rather than success on the first attempt a good enough rule of thumbp

Negative 601 pIm working on modifying some existing heavyhanded code that simply calls code[tableView reloadData]code on any change, to using more specific table updates with the insertdelete methods.p  pHowever, Im getting some really bad behavior in doing so.

Negative 601 pIm trying to create a AJAX push implementation in PHP using a Comet longpolling method. My code involves using codefilegetcontentscode to read a file repeatedly to check for any messages to send to the user. To reduce server load, Im using two text files one containing the actual command and one acting as a change notifier, which either is iterated through 09 or contains a UNIX timestamp. My question is, how often can I access and read from a small only a few bytes file without overloading the server The push implementation means that I can poll for changes much more often than requesting a file every few seconds, but theres still must be a limit. p  pIf it helps, Im using the 1amp1 Home Linux hosting plan, which is shared hosting. p

Negative 601 pI am working on a project where my teams Flash application is being displayed in another teams WebKit browser.  We are experiencing a bug when a Flash Accordions selected index is changed the webpage itself refreshes.  Since this is a mapbased application, this is unacceptable since the users Area of Interest is lost.p  pFrom my research so far, I understand that Flash uses DeepLinking to set the state of the Flash App based on fragments in the url without actually refreshing the page.  So, a change in the Accordions selected index updates the url, and uses that url to do stuff without actually refreshing the page. p  pSince this is not a problem in any other browser FF,IE,Chrome,Safari, the incompatibility seems to be with the DeepLinking and the WebKit.  Both teams are actively troubleshooting, but time is running out.  Does anyone know of a method to disable the url from changing while still achieving the desired result i.e. the accordion still changes panelsp
Negative 601 pI am looking to make a custom window which would look something like this never mind the quick photoshopp  pimg srchttpi35.tinypic.com20ff803.png altalt text p  pThe main problem I have is not to make the window transparent although I guess any info is welcome, but that I want to be able to click only on the visible part of the buttons. For example, if I click just outside the top left of the 5 button, I want it to register a click on the 1 button and not the 5 button, even though I clicked in button 5s bounding box. And if I click just ouside of the 1 buttons top left corner, I want it to click on whatever is beneath my window and not on the button. I also need to be able to resize this window and the pictures in the buttons should resize with them.p  pI was thinking of using a transparent NSWindow with transparent NSButtons containing PNGs with alpha for each button but I think the overlapping buttons will be a problem.p  pI have also heard about applications like Bowtie, SweetFM and others using WebKit to display their interfaces. If that is a possibility on at least 10.3 that would be interesting, but I dont know how that would work either.p  pI looked around for click masks, areas or something like that but I havent found anything yet. I will update this post as I find more info if I do.p  pAny hints on how to proceedp  pNote that I am working on 10.4 and emideallyem I need to support some older versions of Mac OS X too.p  pAlso, I found the rounded window example on Apples dev. site but it doesnt run on 10.4 anymore so Im not sure this is the way to go.p  pThanks in advancep  h1UPDATEh1  pemsee update 2, this problem is fixed nowemp  pOK now Im having a slightly different but not unrelated issue. What I did so far is thisp  pI opted for making a custom control that Ill be able to use for each of my buttonsp  p1 Subclass NSControl and override drawRect, mouseUp, mouseDragged and mouseDown. This way I can get the behavior I want when dragging on a button move the window.p  p2 Load images for each button states same shape but one is darkened into NSImages and draw them into the view using codecompositeToPointfromRectoperationcode when necessary. The images are strong185 x 185strong pixels strongPNG files with alphastrong exported from Photoshop.p  p3 Get the NSImages bitmap representationp  precodeNSBitmapImageRep bitRep  [[NSBitmapImageRep imageRepWithData[unpressedImage TIFFRepresentation]] retain] codepre  pemORemp  precodeNSBitmapImageRep bitRep  [[unpressedImage representations] objectAtIndex0] codepre  pBoth seem to give the same result. I tried compositing this bitmap rep onto my window to see if the image has same size and look as the original and all seems good youll see why I did that after this enumeration....p  p4 In the mouse event methods, I use the bitmap representation to get the alpha component for a particular pointp  precodeNSPoint mouse  [self convertPoint[theEvent locationInWindow] fromViewnil]  Returns the correct x and y positions on the control i.e between 0 and 185 for each axis.  NSColor colorUnderMouse  [[[unpressedImage representations] objectAtIndex0] colorAtXmouse.x ymouse.y] float alpha  [colorUnderMouse alphaComponent] codepre  pThen I print the alpha value to the console but I am getting very weird results. Getting the alpha component and the color under the mouse seems to work at first glance the colors and alpha returned are in my bitmap but it looks like the color is not taken at the right point in the codebitRepcode, or the image contained in the codebitRepcode is distorted it isnt distorted when I composite the codebitRepcode on the window though, which is very strange. Again I doublechecked the x and y mouse coordinates were in the 0,185 range and that the size of the codeNSBitmapImageRepcode is 185 x 185 too.p  pFirst it looks like the codeNSBitmapImageRepcode is flipped horizontally compared to my codeNSImagecode. If I flip my coordinates the values returned seem mostly OK most of the shape seems to fit with the values returned but there are still parts of the image which return wrong values.p  pIm clueless at this point and having never worked with codeNSBitmapImageRepcode before maybe I just forgot to specify some format information about my image which would be why the values are off. Could someone clarify this pleasep  pThanks againp  h1UPDATE 2h1  pOk never mind, I found the issue. I used the setColoratXy method to draw a colored dot on the bitRep before printing it on my window and the issue was clear as day the Y coordinate is reversed in the bitRep, but the image is printed with the good orientation. This means that the bitRep has Windowsstyle topleft origin coordinate system while the window has the cartesian coordinate system bottomleft origin. Simply reversing my Y coordinate fixed the issues I had getting the alpha component and color.p  pThis must have been written somewhere in the docs, sorry to have bothered you because of my lack of research...p

Negative 601 pImagine there is a strongvery very large roomstrong in the shape of a hollow cube. There are magic balls hanging in the air at fixed discrete positions of the room. No magic ball has another one exactly above it. If we take an strongimaginary horizontal plane of infinite areastrong and pass through the cube, how can we be sure that the plane doesnt cut through any of the magic balls p  pThe height of a magic ball is given as a function of its position x and y. The distribution is such a way that some balls are at the same height while other are at different heights. Let the function bebr           codez  axy  bx  cycodebr  where a,b,c are positive integer constants. The positions xaxis and yaxis values and also the height z are discrete values for simplicity, we can consider them positive integers.p  pemIf the ball distribution function was z10xy8x4y, then it is impossible to have a z value of 15 or 21. So a plane at z15 or z21 would not cut any of the balls In fact, in this case, any plane with a height z  any odd number would not cut through the balls. It is noticeable that there a some planes with height as even numbers that donot cut through the balls.emp  pWe do not want to find the heights of  all the magic balls and compare it with the height of the horizontal plane, as that would be like trying all the possible combinations and would take very long time even on a computer.p  pOur aim is to find a fast method by which we can tell whether a given value of z height can be produced by any pair of x,y positions.strongIf a given z cannot be produced, then a plane at that height doesnt cut through any ballsstrong The question is also similar to finding whether a given number is present in a sequence produced by a function of two variables.p  pIt would a great help if U could give me any suggestions to solve this problem.

Negative 601 pIt seems like there is an increasingly popular trend to style hyperlinks in a color thats barely distinguishable from body text. I noticed this just the other day on an a hrefhttpwww.sfgate.comcgibinblogsparentingdetailampentryid66056SFGate blog pagea. Also notice that link just a few words ago. Are my eyes getting worse, or is that hard to spotp  pI certainly understand styling hyperlinks to look better than browser default styles. But, if theyre not easy to see, whats the point of having them in the first placep  pMy best guess is that designers or whomever makes the styling decisions are wary of interrupting eye tracking with colors or other styling that is significantly different than the body text. That would make some sense, but I feel that theres a lot more room for compromise  i.e., styling links to be different enough from the body text that theyre easy to spot, while not making them so flashy that they attract the eye to the detriment of easy reading.p  pWould anyone make the argument that subtle hyperlinks are more effective than more obvious ones Or, can you point me to any theories or testing conclusions that may justify their usep  hr   pMike Daniels Thanks for clarifying that the color Im having trouble differentiating on this site is the visited link color  I hadnt noticed that, but youre right. The unvisited link color is rather prominent, and it makes more sense to me that visited links would blend in more with the surrounding text.p  pOn another note, Im not sure that I buy the argument that a hover coloreffect is enough to properly distinguish a hyperlink. I dont feel that it serves the cause of usability that a user should have to hover over a link to confirm that it is in fact clickable. I think that should be made obvious at a glance.p  pI actually have a very good IPSpanel monitor and nearperfect vision with my glasses on. I can see the visited links on this page and those on the SFGate blog if I scan for them, but my argument is that it would only take an underline, a different color, or another visual distinction to make the links stand out much more.p  pWhat Im really wondering is why  assuming that the designers on a hightraffic site like SFGate know what theyre doing and have made conscious decisions about link colors  they would choose to style the links to resemble the body text so closely Is there reasoning behind thatp

Negative 601 pI have this question on and of for a year or two, but it is so nonspecific, and my native language is not English, so I dont know how to ask to be precise and everybody will understand what is my dilemma.p  pIt is even more valid if using objects but for the sake of simplicity Ill make a simple example theoretical with a function and database.p  pWe all know functions are good because I dont need on every page to think about what it does, it simply does it. Lets say we have a member table in mysql that has many fields including ID, username, age, sex, avatarlink. For this example tats enough...p  pNow I want to make a function named fWriteUser. That function would on many locations in a site write username, put a small picture of member gender sex and put a avatar image next to it and when you go with mouse over username it would say users age. Ok, stupid example, but it is ok I guess...p  pOn every page I deal with usernames of course I have a recordset with some of the parameters I need from them. For example in forum I also take username and ID out of this table and from forum tables I get topic and message of forum post...p  pNow I have 2 choices to call the functionp  ol liI allways call the function with like fWriteUseruserID. The userID I have in session variable I use ASP but the question is not ASP specific, but I could have a cookie or something else. I dont worry about calling this function, as I only feed userID and the function does the rest. On every page on the site I have same call and I get what the function is supposed to to. But this way I need in the function to take sex, avatarlink, username from the query. I HAVE to make another select from table member to take this data out. And if in forum I have 20 topics this would be called 20 times. ID is known of the member so I guess this is a fast function. If I would use objects I would call object method but in this method the query would also need to be run.li ol  pAnd sicer I take some member data on every page I in fact spend mysql time doing it in function again. For the commodity of having to call function only with ID, so I can in fact later change inside of function and add some new member info as I only change the function itself.p  ol liSecond way is I feed the function with all the required data from every page I need to call it like fWriteUseruserID, username, sex, avatarlink... That way I can take all this data on every HTML page when I take other member data so the SELECT query runs only once. The big downside is that if I want to add new member variable I have to open all pages and in the SELECT statement add another variable and change function call to add another variable or add new property if using objects.li ol  pFor a big site approach 2 is certanly a pain to implement and sustain... I would prefer to use option 1, but that would add many more select statements on every page, because member function call is just example, I may have other functions.p  pSo my question is is it wise to make 10 selects instead of one every function its own select or is it better to feed every variable from the main page and make it hard to maintain...p  pI dont know how much processor time is neeed for one SELECT from members if I take just a few variabls, I have indexes and about 100.000 members in the table. Is this select cached somehowp  pI could make like a 100 session variables for members so I can feed them when needed inside functions but I am not sure how many sessions I can have and it would work for members but not for some other data...p  pI know it is not a specific problems but more of a best practice problem, but this is preventing me to make functions self sustained and dependent on one parameter instead of 10 and I am having difficulty maintaining the site. I tried to use objects I am now to OOP but I see objects methods have the same problem  you have to SELECT in each method if you want to do different things with object. I mean, functions in objects that need something from database have same problem.p  pThank you for everybody who made it till here... I know it was a long read  But it is a year or two on my mind...p  pYoursp  pJerryp  pstrongUPDATE strong on all the answers there are, I think the point is still being missed. Let me try to make myself more clear with a practical example.p  pI have a forum. On the forum there is a list of 50 topics with titles and user data. Titles are in table topics and userdata comes from table members.p  pI have 2 choices to fetch the datap  ol lipI can make a SELECT FROM topics JOIN members etc... and get in each row a title and all the user data I need.pli lipI can take only topics data and do not take member data except member ID at this point for every loop. Where in HTML I have to show usernames their gender, avatar link etc. I can call function fWriteUservarID and the function in effect does everything, load from member table and does output with the data.pli ol  pObviously it is better to use method 1 because I call select 1 time I have all the data I need for the page in this select. But because I dont want to fetch member data again from function fWriteUser I have to pass all the member data that the function uses like call fWriteUserID, avatarlink, gender, etc..p  pI am using this approach now and it is fast of course. The second approach would not be so efficient as I would need 1 query to fetch topic data and then ntimes make SELECT in the function to get user data for topic writer 1, topic writer 2 etc. I could do cache as was suggested, but that would only help if the authors on the topic list would be the same. If I have 50 different authors each with its own topic, I would still need a recordset loop to get topic data and user ID and inside that loop I would call function 50 times which would make 50 SELECT statements for 50 topics to get the member data of the correcponding members.p  pBut this second approach is nicer to maintain pages. I just call fWriteUservarID and I dont worry. Using first approach I worry. If I add another parameter I want to have manipulating print output from a member like display age I need to open ALL the html pages I have and add age to all the queries that I use on the pages where memebrs are involved and this are of course different queries, not same, as once I join members with topics, once with recipes, once with photo albums etc.... That is hours work just because I wanted to add age. So extending the call to have one more parameter is possible automatically using arrays, but the problem is I have to modify all the join queries anyway.p  pI hope I am more clear now what bothers me, if not I reast my case p

Negative 601 pYou know how when you start typing in Instant, the suggestions for words you want start to come up, and the 1 suggestion is some grey text beside the word That is what I am interested in trying to mimic in javascript, prefer, but for text fields and text areas.p  pI thought about getting the x and y coordinates of the current caret position, and placing the grey text there. However, Im not sure if this is the best option, because if I want to place that grey text in the middle of a sentence, or what have you, then the rest of the text would have to be shifted over to make room. Not to mention the fact that I havent yet found a good way to even get the x and y coordinates of the caret in a textfield or textarea. For these reasons, this option just seems inefficient.p  pAlso, the code can not be the same or near the same as what Google has. One additional feature I want is having the grey text appear in the middle of sentences, which Googles code doesnt support. So, that would need to be included in the solution.p  pDoes anyone have an idea or some code of how to achieve this I have been pondering this for a while and havent really gotten anywhere.p  pThanksp

All UML tools Ive seen are not really practical except this onep  pa hrefhttpwww.intrinsarc.com relnofollowhttpwww.intrinsarc.comap  precodeA hierarchical component model with full connectors At the heart of Evolve is a hierarchical component model with full connectors. Connectors act like wires between components, making it simple and intuitive to express detailed structures that are dicult or impossible in other approaches such as dependency injection. Resemblance and evolution These two constructs provide unprecedented levels of support for component reuse.   Resemblance     is a form of component inheritance. Evolution builds on this to allow the structure of an existing     system to be remodeled, without destroying the original denition. These facilities can be used to     create variants of a system, or to switch in test components. codepre  pDid someone try it  what do you think  It seems like based on UML but not on UML class but other types of diagrams. p  pAny other tool which can do real code generation UML or not p  pWhat I mean by real EMF is not such a tool its only a framework for building UML Tool as far as I can see not a tool by itself which facilitates the building and maintenance of an application.p  pSame for Visual Studio Ultimate.

Negative 601 pWe would like to embed some code in each ASP.NET page that queries its Last Modified Date and displays it at the bottom of the page. p  pIn the past, weve relied on the person making any changes to the page to manually update the emThis page last modified on todays dateem text at the bottom of the page. Many times they forget to update this, which is causing some confusion as to when the information was last updated on that particular page. Since the site is not based on a CMS which could store this information in its backend database, were trying to do the determination as to when the page was last saved from the file system on the server and include that date in the text of the page.p  pIm not sure how a pages being based on a Master Page plays into the last modified date. What were really looking for is for the content page files LMD get queried so we can embed that in the text of the page and not the LMD of the Master Page its based on.p  pThanks p

Most of my users are small businesses which only require singleuser capabilities. So when MSDOS versions of Informix i.e. from 2.10.06E 1985 to 4.10.DD6 1991 where available, I deployed my apps on these DOS versions of Informix. p  pWhen Microsoft Windows started gaining more popularity circa 1990, Windows 3.1, my DOSbased ISQL apps wouldnt properly function unless the Windowsbased systems where restarted in DOS mode. My apps worked fine until DOS 6.22 Windows98. p  pI then tried to persuade my DOSbased users to upgrade to UNIXbased systems in order to work with supported versions of ISQL, but only a few opted to migrate. At this point, I realized that RDS had not given any priority for a migration path of ISQL or I4GL under Windows. RDS made a mediocre attempt with NewEra but that product was flawed and failed. p  pSo, for my stubborn DOSbased users, who wanted my app to work under Windows, I provided DOS 6.22 under a virtual machine Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 which has Windows shared folder capability example DOS Drive W  a Windows Vista Desktop Folderand Windows device support examples DOS drive F  Windows Drive F USB Flash Drive, DOS LPT1 rerouted to a Windows USB Dot Matrix Printer.p  pYou may ask yourself why I have stuck with ISQL and not moved up to I4GL. The main reason is because my app is not that complicated, development and modification speed with ISQL is so much faster than I4GL, Perform screens allow multiple tables on same screen , Ace reports are very fast to code, etc.p  pWhen RDS stopped providing Informix for Windows, I began to look for alternatives like FourGen, 4Js, Querix, etc. but none of them matched the development and modification speed of my ole ISQL versions. I wish IBM could provide an ISQL version which works under native Windows, Im resistant to coding in 4GL when most mundane things are automatically handled by ISQLs Perform, Ace and SQL procs.p

Negative 601 pNow this is going to be a little weird usecase. Maybe someone has some ideas.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm writing a website that is very AJAX intensive. In fact there are hardly any full page reloads. This implies that a lot of template composition is done on the client side. For the moment I use some self written scripts in jQuery. To keep things reasonably simple I only use variable placeholders, like this code somevar.someattr.someotherattr code. I could probably use something like mustache to achieve a similar behaviour.p  pOn the other hand, from time to time I like to be able to do some composition on the server side.

Negative 601 pWe are using .net C 4.0, VS 2010, EF 4.1 and legacy code in this project we are working on.p  pIm working on a win form project where I have made a decision to start using entity framework 4.1 for accessing an ms sql db. The code base is quite old and we have an existing data layer that uses data adapters. These data adapters are used all over the place in web apps and win form apps My plan is to replace the old db access code with EF over time and get rid for the tight coupling between UI layers and data layer.p  pSo my idea is to more or less combine EF with the legacy data access layer and slowly replace the legacy data layer with a more modern take on things using EF. So for now we need to use both EF and the legacy db access code.p  pWhat I have done so far is to add a project containing the edmx file and context. The edmx is generated using database first approach. I have also added another project that contains the POCO classes by using ADO.NET POCO Entity Generator. I have more or less followed Julia Lermans approach in her book Programming Entity Framework on how to split the model and the generated POCO classes. The database model has been set for years and its not an option the change the table and the relationships, triggers, stored procedures, etc, so Im basically stuck with the db model as it is. p  pI have read about the repository pattern and unit of work and I kind of like the patterns, but I struggle to implement them when I have both EF and the legacy db access code to deal with. Specially when I dont have the time to replace all of the legacy db access code with a pure EF implementation. In an perfect world I would start all over again with a fresh take one the data model, but that is not an option here.p  pIs the repository and unit of work patterns the way to go here In order to use the POCO classes in my business layer, I sometimes need to use both EF and the legacy db code to populate my POCO classes. In another words, I can sometimes use EF to retrieve a part of the data I need and the use the old db access layer to retrieve the rest of the data and then map the data to my POCO classes. When I want to update some data I need to pick data from the POCO classes and use the legacy data access code to store the data in the database. So I need to map the data retrieved from the legacy data access layer to my POCO classes when I want to display the data in the UI and vice versa when I want to save data to the data base.p  pTo complicate things we store some data in tables that we dont know the name of before runtime Please dont ask me why . So in the old db access layer, we had to create sql statements on the fly where we inserted the table and column names based on information from other tables.p  pI also find that the relationships between the POCO classes are somewhat too data base centric. In another words, I feel that I need to have a more simplified domain model to work with. Perhaps I should create a domain model that fits the bill and then use the POCO classes as DAOs to populate the domain model classesp  pHow would you implement this using the Repository pattern and Unit of Work pattern if that is the way to gop

Negative 601 pTotal noob here. p  pI am in the process of building my hobby website and feel that I could, with some hard work, create a fully functional site. However, I am rather stuck on modal popout window. p  pI understand the basics of getting one to work, i.e. download jquery or related java library, attach said library to webpage in the  section. Apply modal popout in similar way making sure to include the CSS for it.p  pI can get it to function in my site, so with Shadowbox I managed to get it to actually popout. Where I am stuck, with Shadowbox in particular, is actually putting stuff inside the modal popout. I am really only interesting putting text in the modal popout with maybe a link or small picture to compliment the text. p  pWhat is hindering me is my lack of knowledge. This may be either a lack of understanding with regards to class attributes or href attributes, or a lack of knowledge. The only progression I have made with this is simply because of the copy and paste, and some image path manipulation with Shadowbox. I am still horribly confused as to how the script activates, what tagsattributes I need to make to ensure data within a  is included in the modal popout window.p  pI would really like to have a modal popout like this a hrefhttptypedeskref.com relnofollowhttptypedeskref.coma but feel that this is far, far beyond me. p  pIn summary I dont know how to put textimages inside of a modal popout. I dont know how a modal popout is activated and how to ensure I can control what is kept inside of it. The reason why I say this is because the limited sucess I have had with Shadow box is because it has somehow managed to pick up everything that is on my site, images, links etc. So when the modal popout is opened, there is my site, in modal form.p  pThanks for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate any help or advice you can give me. Even a shove in the direction where such information can be located would be greatp  pp.s. I am using dreamweaver cs5p

Negative 601 pIm quite new to openGL and I have been trying out some sample codes from a book about game programming on the iphone that Im currently reading.  One of the samples was a 3d game and I am able to successfully compile and run it on the iOS simulator fullscreen. p  pThe problem I have is when I run it on the actual hardware an ipod touch 4G, the game does not go full screen it only occupies like 14 of the screen. I was able to narrow the problem down to the code belowp  precodeGLint backingWidth, backingHeight   BOOL bindLayer  ....  glGetRenderbufferParameterivOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, GLRENDERBUFFERWIDTHOES, ampbackingWidth  glGetRenderbufferParameterivOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, GLRENDERBUFFERHEIGHTOES, ampbackingHeight  ....  codepre  pFor some reason, backingWidth and backingHeight is set to 640 and 960 respectively after the calls above I expected it to be 320 x 480 which is the iphones screen size. On the iOS simulator and an older ipod touch 2g, it works just fine. p  pThe code above is part of an object which subclasses UIView, and overrides the drawRect method it is empty though. The thing that baffled me is when I removed the drawRect method hence not overriding it, it somehow fixed the problem I described above. p  pCan anyone shed some light on this Is it not safe to override a views drawRect method when you are drawing in openGL Why does it work on the simulator and an older ipod touchp

Negative 601 pIve forked this question from a similar question I made in a comment I made to one of the many great answers I recieved. I was originally asking about AST macros, which mostly provoked very detailed and thoughtful responses from Lispers. Thanks.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7046950lazyevaluationvsmacrosLazy Evaluation vs Macrosap  pThe question I made in a comment was whether projectspecific DSLs are actually a good idea. Of course, this is completely subjective  After all, when you are writing in a really expressive language, where do you draw the line between an expressive API and an actual DSL For example, I think what most Rubyists call DSLs are actually just welldesigned APIs and nothing more.p  pNote that I say strongprojectspecificstrong APIs. I dont think many will argue against using regular expressions or SQL where it makes sense to do so.p  pBut despite this, I think we can all draw a vauge, hazy line between an API and a DSL. Of course theyre both really APIs, but whatever.p  pOn one extreme you have Lisp, where DSLs seem to be actively encouraged via macros. On the other you have the likes of Java where DSLs are pretty much impossible.p  pProponents of DSLs would argue that they increase flexibility, expressiveness, and increase consistency for example, a custom number object using the same operators as the languages own numbers.p  pDetractors would say that they can lead to sublanguages that nobody except the DSL writer knows, kills the point of having different programming languages in the first place, and leads to code nobody can understand because the way of stronginterfacingstrong with API is different.p  pI gotta say, I agree with both sides in many ways. Some Java APIs are just plain nasty due to the lack of expressiveness. Despite this, I can generally always work out whats going on without reading the documentation  Which cant be said about custom DSLs in the slightest. Maybe DSL proponents argue that you should strongalwaysstrong read API documentation. I disagree, but I also digress.p  pBut lets look at some of the big languages at the moment. C and Java, namely. Neither of them really do DSLs, yet theyre massively popular. Is this precisely because they strongdontstrong allow things like DSLs, allowing mediocre coders to churn out code thats still comprehensiblep  pIs the fact that DSLs allow mediocre coders to produce impenetrable garbage the reason why Lisp is not used as much as it should be, despite what a DSL can look like in the right handsp

Negative 601 pIve an application that runs on a webpage, it has a list of facebook ids and run through them checking if the logged user has any mutual friends with the ids on the list for making this verificaton Im using the Rest API with the friends.getMutualFriends metond, Im using this method becasue in this way I can get the mutual friends without having both users authenticated, I just need the authentication for the origin userid, in the case of FQL or using the Graph API both users should be connected so that I can get the mutual friends, this is why the getMutualFriends method is so useful in this case. The problem that Im having is that when I try to pull the mutual friends for a user that has a lot of friends then I get this error p  blockquote   perrorcode 18,     errormsg This API call could not be completed due to resource limits,p blockquote  pif I try to do that with a user that has less frineds the in will work, I know that saying less or a lot is novet very accurate , so , lets take a look at this example, if I try to execute this call with a user that has 300 friends the call will work, but if I try to do that exact same thing with a user that has 700 friends  itll return back with the error that I put above, so I thought that it could be the amount of calls per second so I limited that but it did not worked, I tried resetting the app keys, Ive tried with several differente users, Ive tried to do it with a new application, and even if I just try make one call to compare 2 users itll fail if the user has a large amout of friends, the code that Im using for this isp  precodefunction getMutualFriendsfacebook, uid1, uid2      try              param     array             method  gt friends.getMutualFriends,             sourceuid    gt uid1,             targetuid  gt uid2,             callbackgt                       mutualFriends      facebookgtapiparam         return mutualFriends            catchException o                    return serializeo           return null   function getMutualFriendInfofacebook, uid1, uid2       mutualfriendsgetMutualFriendsfacebook, uid1, uid2     if isarraymutualfriends              frienduids  implode,,mutualfriends         try                      param  array                 method gt users.getInfo,                 uids gt frienduids,                 fields gt name,picsquare,picbig,                 callback gt                               friendinfo  facebookgtapiparam             return friendinfo                  catch Exception o                       return serializeo                   return serializemutualfriends  codepre  pSo my questions are, is there anything that Im doing wrong on this cade so that it fails Is there any othere way to do this besides the friends.GetMutualFriends method Ive already tried with this codeSELECT uid1 FROM friend WHERE uid2[targetID] AND uid1 IN SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1[sourceID]code but it did not worked. Is there any specific origin on this errorp  pIm very confused because it works for some users and it doesnt for others, Ive searched if theres any api limit but Ive not found anything on that, there are no errors on the API dashboard, this code seemed to work before, and if I execute the call on the test console on facebook Ill get the same error,p  pThanks for are your help, any idea will be appreciated.p

Negative 601 pWhat I have is a MVC framework that I am manipulating the DOM via JavaScript and jQuery. Which to a point is a mute reference to this question. Through the MVC if I go to p  pdomain.compagep  pI land on a default page with recent info, updates, etc. However through the MVC if I go to something likep  pdomain.compageref1ref2ref3p  pWe can handle that on the backend to do what we want. When its gone to directly. So the thought here for this question is, can I mimic the behavior cross browser up to at least up to IE 67, Firefox 3.x, Chrome. And by mimic I mean manipulate the URLURI like I would the DOM itself. This way when someone comes along and navigates to sections via the methods we manipulate the DOM and find something they want to share all they have to do is go up to the browsers URL bar, and then copy and paste it to a message. p  pWhat would be even nicer is a method that can work with the back and forth history buttons on browsers as well. All without having to reloadrefresh the page.p

Negative 601 pI have 2 asp.net web forms. The first has a ScriptManager, History, UpdatePanel and GridView the later is ScriptManager, UpdatePanel and TextBoxes. The premise here is a list that links to a detail form where an item can be edited.p  pFrom within the GridView inside the UpdatePanel, if I use a HyperLink control with the url set to the edit page with the necessary parameters, change something, save it and then click the back button I see the original list with no updates. Pressing F5 to refresh shows the changes.p  pIf instead I use a LinkButton inside the GridView, and handle that LinkButton in codebehind to perform a Response.Redirect to the same edit page with the same parameters, make the same changes, save and then click the back button, the list on the original page refreshes automatically to show my changes.p  pNote that the code in the detail page where the editingsaving takes place does not change  only the way it is first displayed is changed.p  pMy question is this what is it about the Response.Redirect that causes the page to be refreshed when the back button is clicked, and it it possible to replicate this for the direct HyperLink approach I would prefer to use the HyperLink method as I see no reason for the postback, but I want the GridView to refresh when the user browses back to it.p  pThanks.p

Negative 601 pI have created an xml page that holds 2 textviews and a seekbar all without ids. The class CustomSeekBar creates these objects using the xml page as a basic structure. You can see space for the textviews on my emulator, but I am having a hard time figuring out to set the text. Obviously I am missing something, because there is no way for the CustomSeekBar class to be able to tell which textview I want to set the text for.p  pHow do I set the text of each individual view without giving each textview a hardcoded ID The reason I say without a hardcoded ID, is because if each textview is named, then when one textviews text needs to be changed, wont all the textviews texts, with that ID, change How would I call the specific textview ID since my customseekbar class is in a composite relationship with the activityp  pActivity that calls everything.p  precodepublic class ColorsActivity extends ListActivity   Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 601 pI have an android project setup using the mavenandroid plugin.

Negative 601 pIm developping a html5 game but i got this problem if a player is in the mid game and accidentally closes the web browser. Once he  opens the game again, the game starts from the beginning and the game that the player was playing is lost. so i found this solution With the local storage, we can encode the entire game data into JSON and store them. In this way, players can resume their game later.  p  pBut in my game every player has a login , so i should store his login too in the localStorage so every player will have  his own localStorage . p  pSo Cani do this with localStorage   Is there a better solutionp  pThank u in advance  p
Negative 601 pA customer sent me a crash log from an iOS 5.0.1 9A405 device. Im running Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard. The system parts of the crash log call stack fail to symbolicate, and it seems that theyre relevant to the crash there are no iOS 5.0.1 symbols in Xcode. I dont have a 5.0.1 device, and I dont think I can install it, now that 5.1 is the latest.p  pIs there a way for forcedownload symbols for a given iOS version in Xcode without plugging in a devicep  pEDIT seems like you can force a specific iOS version to a device using Xcodes organizer and a restore software image. However, the Dev Portal only offers 5.1 restore images for download. Are older ones available anywherep

But now that I have copied my files over to phonegap running cordovo 1.7.0, on android emulator 2.3 on eclipse none of the DOM calls are returning elements I get something likep  precode0531 132128.686 DCordovaLog841 fileandroidassetwwwformcontroller.js line 159  TypeError Result of expression body [undefined] is not an object. codepre  pFor all the calls. I have verified that the device has the correct xml its not empty or anythingp  pSo having to get this done I tried to use jQuery to navigate the document object hoping it knew something I didnt.  Using calls likep  precodesurveyXML.findtitle surveyXML.findhtitle codepre  pdo not work at all.  But tags without the codehcode prefix work fine,  if I were to search for codesurveyXML.findtextcode it returns all codetextcode elements as expected. p  pSeeing as the root elements are codelthtmlgtcode  I tried to specify codedataType htmlcode just to try it even though the document is clearly marked as codeltxml version1.0gtcode  and jquery is unable to parse it, as expected.p  pSo I am wondering strongHow can I parse this XML cross platform so that it can work both in a browser and phonegap.  And, supposing that it cant work in both using the same DOM manipulation functions, how can I at least make it work in phonegapstrongp  pAs always any help is appreciated.  Thank you.p  pstrongEDIT For right Now I am just manually referencing the exact locations of the elements like to get to body I am going codexml.firstChild.children[1]code.  Because I am underdeadline.  I def feel like there should be a way to use getElementsByTagName still. ty.strongp
Negative 601 pI want to get the year and month from a COleDateTime object and I want it to be as fast as possible. I have 2 optionsp  precodeCOleDateTime mydatetime int year  mydatetime.GetYear int month  mydatetime.GetMonth codepre  porp  precodeCOleDateTime mydatetime SYSTEMTIME mydtassystemtime mydatetime.GetAsSystemTimemydtassystemtime int year  mydtassystemtime.wYear int month  mydtassystemtime.wMonth codepre  pThe question is, which would be fasterp  pcodeCOleDateTimecode stores its internal date representation as a codeDATEcode typedef, and so when you call codeGetYearcode and codeGetMonthcode it has to calculate these each time. In the codeSYSTEMTIMEcode case, the values of codewYearcode and codewMonthcode are stored as codeDWORDcodes so it is just a case of retrieving the values, but there is an overhead in converting a codeCOleDateTimecode to a codeSYSTEMTIMEcode.p  pThanks,p  pSterrenp

Negative 601 pI have a function which receives a filename and a json object to write to a text file. p  pThe object is updated and needs to entirely replace the current contents of the file. Each site visitor has their own file. Multiple rapid changes create a situation where the file is truncated by codefopenfile,wcode, then not written to as its locked. End result is empty file. p  pIm sure theres a standard simply way to do this as its such a usual activity. Ideally what Im looking for is a way to check if a file has a lock before truncating the file with codefopencode in codewcode mode or a way to switch modes. p  pIt seems strange that you would have to truncate the file with codefopencode to get a file handle to pass to codeflockcode to check if its locked  but you just truncated it, so whats the pointp  pHeres the function I have so farp  precodefunction updateFilefilename, jsonFileData      fp  fopenfilename,w     if flockfp, LOCKEX            fwritefp, jsonFileData         flockfp, LOCKUN         fclosefp         return true      else          fclosefp         return false       codepre

For some reason, the server was returning a 403 error instead of a 404 error, most probably because of security to not allow users to ping common files to see whether they exist. Once the image link was removed, it did not prompt for relogin any more. I thought the CultureInfo was the reason because this is the only code common used in those two pages and not in the others, however, the fault was of a jQuery DataPicker CSS file. p

Negative 601 pIn my application, Im dealing with a largersize classes over 50 methods each of which is reasonably complex. Im not worried about the complexity as they are still straight forward in terms of isolating pieces of functionality into smaller methods and then calling them.  This is how the number of methods becomes large a lot of these methods are private  specifically isolating pieces of functionality.p  pHowever when I get to the implementation stage, I find that I loose track of which methods have been implemented and which ones have not been.  Then at linking stage I receive errors for the unimplemented methods.  This would be fine, but there are a lot of interdependencies between classes and in order to link the app I would need to get EVERYTHING ready.  Yet I would prefer to get one class our of the way before moving to the next one.p  pFor reasons beyond my control, I cannot use an IDE  only a plain text editor and g compiler.  Is there any way to find unimplemented methods in one class without doing a full linking  Right now I literally do text search on method signatures in the implementation cpp file for each of the methods, but this is very time consuming.p

Negative 601 pI have a special situation that is outside my area of expertise, being a PHP developer and not a network administrator.p  pA client wants to do split testing between the new website I built them, and their old website built by a competitor. All traffic will be sent to the existing url a.com. I have access to the clients godaddy account for a.com, and traffic is sent via an ARecord to a server that I emdo notem have access to. The old webmaster will not do anything to help my cause, understandably.p  pThus, I believe I need to change the arecord on the domain to point to my own server. But how will I send 50 of traffic to the old server If I navigate to the IP Address on the ARecord directly the website doesnt come up, I presume because the server only knows to use the vhost if the request comes in as a.com. So, I need to change the arecord, then send traffic to this IP address requesting this server....and I need to do this for 50 of the hits I receive. Im not sure if I can do this using php header...Im not sure how to do this at all.p  pAny recommendations are welcome...Im racking my brain but cant find a solution.p

Items are processed in a function ap  pWhat i want to do is whenever a is called, create a new thread with all as processing code in it, and immediately exit a. Next time a will be called is called immediately by the caller which i dont have access to, will again create a new thread and terminate.

I dont have access to the function that calls a. if no threading is involved, caller waits until a finishes its calculations, and then calls it again providing the next x,y s. What i want to do is doing parallel the calculations of 8 as. If a can start its calculations and return create a thread and exit, caller will call a again with the new x,y while the old are still being calculated. This is the concept. Calculations of every x,y pair is totally independent to any other pair.p  precodeint counter  0 pthreadt threads[8] i have 8 cores threadargs args[8] arguments that pass to the threads int res[8] threads store their results here  void aint x, int y  a is being called by caller immediately after it returns with a new pair of x,y     args[counter].x  x struct threadargs has x,y,mycounter     args[counter].y  y     args[counter].mycounter  counter     pthreadcreateampthreads[counter], NULL, calculatexy, void ampargs[counter]     calculatexy stores results in res[argsgtmycounter]           ifcounter  8         return      it reaches here every 8th call of a total number of a calls is an exact multiple of 8     counter  0     for int i  0 i lt 8 i         pthreadjointhreads[i], NULL      GO ON... append the 8 results to a text and go on... end a codepre

Negative 601 pIm experimenting with Springs codeDeferredResultcode on Tomcat, and Im getting crazy results.

The codestartcode request creates a codeDeferredResultcode with a 4 second timeout. The codestopcode request will set a result on the codeDeferredResultcode. If you send codestopcode before or after the deferred result times out, everything works fine.p  pHowever if you send codestopcode at the same time as codestartcode times out, things go crazy. Ive added an codeonTimeoutcode action to make this easy to reproduce, but thats not necessary for the problem to occur. With an APR connector, it simply deadlocks. With a NIO connector, it sometimes works, but sometimes it incorrectly sends the timeout message to the codestopcode client and never answers the codestartcode client.p  pTo test thisp  pre classlangsh prettyprintoverridecodecurl httplocalhostteststart amp sleep 5 curl httplocalhostteststop codepre  pI dont think Im doing anything wrong. The Spring documentation seems to say its okay to call codesetResultcode at any time, even after the request already expired, and from any thread the  application can produce the result from a thread of its choice.p  pVersions used Tomcat 7.0.39 on Linux, Spring 3.2.2.p

Negative 601 pIve made a program lately that uses Tkinter in Python 3.3. I would like to distribute the program as a simple executable file that does not require an installation. Ive had a lot of experience using cxfreeze to compile scripts to executables, but unfortunately it does not produce standalone applications, and it requires various DLL and pyd files to be in the current working directory of the executable file it produces. Ive also looked into other packaging programs such as py2exe and pyinstaller, but unfortunately they do not support Python 3.x. So, does anybody know how I can compile a Python 3.3 script into a standalone executable file without any dependenciesp  pThanksp  pstrongUpdatestrong I have written a python script to move all of the DLL and pyd files inside of the exe file cxfreeze produces. Although this is not a very clean solution, it does work with regular python scripts. The problem lies when I import modules such as socket, or tkinter, and the executable file does not know where to look for them, so I get the errorp  precodeImportError No module named socket codepre  pIf anybody knows how I can fix this  maybe by changing the location the executable looks for its dependencies  that would be great, thanks againp
Negative 601 pHi guys a very young student here. Few days in learning now, and it is time to start getting the code looking neat, readable and to any and all standards likely already in place that i am unaware of before i develop some bad habits The tutorials i am following do not mention proper practices when it comes to readability, format, notation, etc. Basically anything on how to make the code a delight to go through instead of a nightmare. I of course have my own personal preferences but i am looking for more information and advice on the most widely used formatting and notation practices. p  pHowever, information is appearing to be exceedingly difficult to obtain regarding these and other relevant subjects. So much so that i am not sure there are even widely accepted style standards to follow. So far i have only been able to find sizable information regarding hungarian notation.p  pSo i am seeking your help and i am wondering what are the most widely accepted and encouraged formatting, notation, etc  that other programmers, companies, and those in relevant fields of business look for in your codep  pIf you could point me in the right direction by providing a link to detailed information, or provide advice or information on what your business, companies that you know of, fellow programmers, and the programming community as a whole look for in the readability, presentation, flow, format, notation, etc of the code.p  pIf there arent really standards and the way people write their code varies widely let me know.p  pI would greatly appreciate and help you have to offer.

Negative 601 pIm working with PayPal IPN.  Im using a script Ive used for years and have never had any issues with it, however, now Im working with the MassPay API and including 250 on a single request.  As such, the IPN data sent is much larger than what I typically deal with, and somehow Im losing data.p  pWithin my IPN script, the first thing Im doing is serializing the POST data and saving it to a TEXT field in MySQL.  I dont get any errors from PHP or MySQL when I do this and the data shows up in my table just fine, however, its missing almost half of the data that was actually included with the POST when I compare it to what shows up in the PayPal IPN History log.p  pOutside of saving the raw IPN data, Im also looping through all MassPay items within my script to process the payments individually.  Heres a PHP snippet of how Im compiling all of the individual mass payments within the IPN...p  precode Mass Payments    i  1    masspayments  array    whileissetPOST[masspaytxnid . i]         masspaytxnid  issetPOST[masspaytxnid . i]  POST[masspaytxnid . i]       mccurrency  issetPOST[mccurrency . i]  POST[mccurrency . i]       mcfee  issetPOST[mcfee . i]  POST[mcfee . i]  0     mcgross  issetPOST[mcgross . i]  POST[mcgross . i]  0     receiveremail  issetPOST[receiveremail . i]  POST[receiveremail . i]       status  issetPOST[status . i]  POST[status . i]       uniqueid  issetPOST[uniqueid . i]  POST[uniqueid . i]        currentpaymentdataset  array              masspaytxnid gt masspaytxnid,              mccurrency gt mccurrency,              mcfee gt mcfee,              mcgross gt mcgross,              receiveremail gt receiveremail,              status gt status,              uniqueid gt uniqueid                  arraypushmasspayments, currentpaymentdataset     i     codepre  pAgain, I dont get any PHP warnings, notices, errors, etc. and the IPN script completes successfully with a 200 OK result, however, half of the payment records in my system dont get updated like they should because they arent including in what Im getting from PayPal somehow.  The ones that do show up in my IPN data that I receive get updated as expected in my system.p  pAgain, when I check the PayPal IPN History it shows me that the IPN included all of the data I seem to be missing, and when I compare the two the one in IPN history h as everything starting from masspaytxnid1 through masspaytxnid250.  It has unique IDs for everything, etc.  My script is only seeing unique IDs 100  199, though, and its leaving out lots of other general things like txntype.  p  pAre there any server settings or anything that could be causing me to lose POST data even though Im not getting any errors anywherep  pstrongUPDATEstrong  I wound up taking what PayPal IPN History showed, which includes everything, and I placed that into a PHP script that POSTs the data to my IPN listener.  Im still losing the data, though, so somehow my server is truncating the POST data but not giving me any warnings or anything.  Im not finding any information on what could be causing this or how to fix it, though..p  pAny information on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanksp

The problem, is that it is only printing the first two members of ColumnsColumn the two I got out of the Excel file.p  pHere is my Program.cs main filep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Reflection using Excel  Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel using System.IO using System.Xml.Serialization  namespace ExcelDictionary      public class Program              public static Columns c  new Columns         public static ListltColumnsColumngt objects  new ListltColumnsColumngt          public static void Mainstring[] args          if DEBUG             Parser excel  new Parserstuff.xlsx else             Console.WriteFile name              Parser excel  new ParserConsole.ReadLine endif             XmlSerializer x  new XmlSerializertypeofColumns             ListltColumnsColumngt temp  new ListltColumnsColumngt             temp  excel.Parse             c.Items  temp.ToArray             x.SerializeConsole.Out, c             Console.ReadLine             for int i  0 i lt objects.Count i                                               public class Parser              private Excel.Application xlApp         private Excel.Workbook xlBook         private Excel.Worksheet xlSheet          public Parserstring filename                      xlApp  new Excel.Application             xlBook  xlApp.Workbooks.Openfilename             xlSheet  xlBook.Worksheets[1]             xlApp.Visible  true             Start                   public ListltColumnsColumngt Parse                      ListltColumnsColumngt arr  new ListltColumnsColumngt             Start             do                               ColumnsColumn t  new ColumnsColumn                 t.ColumnType  CellValue                     Move0, 1                 t.FieldKey  CellValue                     Move1, 1                 t.EmptyValue                   t.FieldParameters                   t.TypeKey                   t.RelationshipIdentifier                   t.Title                   t.Section                   t.ColumnStyle                   t.ShowAggregation  None                 t.AggregationTotalLevel  All                 t.WeightedByFieldKey                   t.WeightedByFieldParameters                   t.CalculateProportion  False                 t.ProportionTo  GrandTotal                 t.TotalColumnStyle                   t.GroupColumnStyle                   t.Show  True                 arr.Addt               while CellValue   ampamp CellValue  null             return arr                   public void Moveint row, int col                      xlApp.ActiveCell.getOffsetrow, col.Select                    ltreturnsgtValue of Active Cellltreturnsgt         public string CellValue                      return xlApp.ActiveCell.Value2                   public void Start                      xlSheet.getRangeA2.Select                codepre  pand my XMLSchema file which contains the XML deserialized classes dont be taken off by its size, it has A LOT of get set commandsp  precode  ltautogeneratedgt      This code was generated by a tool.

Negative 601 pFor better organization, I have a main .less file that imports other .less files using the import syntax.  In order for the Web Essentials Preview window to work I also have importonce at the top of each .less file that imports the variables.less file.p  pThis solution worked wonderfully until I upgraded to Web Essentials 2.8.  Now Im unable to import any .less file that has import or importonce declared in it.  My main .less file no longer compiles.  p  pIf I remove the importonce statements, the preview window is useless since I cant see the compiled CSS without importing my variables file.p  pI also had a case where I imported a .less file into a ruleset, as defined by lesscss.org in the a hrefhttplesscss.orgimportingImporting into ruleseta section.  This also no longer works since the upgrade to v2.8.p  pHas anyone else experienced these issues or have a resolutionp  pThanksp

Please help ASAP, as time is running out and the presentation layer is almost complete and is depending on the given interface.

Negative 601 pIm observing some strange behavior when I use a codefilesinkcode in boostiostreams and then codeforkcode a child process.p  pThe child continues the same codebase, i.e., no codeexeccode call, because this is done as part of daemonizing the process. My full code fully daemonizaes the process, of course, but I have omitted those steps that are unncessary for reporducing the behavior.p  pThe following code is a emsimplifiedem example that demonstrates the behaviorp  precodeusing namespace std namespace io  boostiostreams  void daemonizestdostreamamp log   int main int argc, char argv    iostreambufferltiofilesinkgt logbuf   stdostream filelogamplogbuf   stdofstream filelog     Step 1 open log   if argc gt 1        filelog.openargv[1]     logbuf.openiofilesinkargv[1]     daemonizefilelog      else     daemonizestdcerr    return EXITSUCCESS    void daemonizestdostreamamp log    log ltlt Log opened. ltlt endl     Step 2 fork  parent stops, child continues   log.flush   pidt pid  fork  error checking omitted    if pid gt 0        log ltlt Parent exiting. ltlt endl     exitEXITSUCCESS      assert0  pid  child continues     Step 3 write to log   sleep1  give parent process time to exit   log ltlt Hello World ltlt endl  codepre  pIf I run this with no argument e.g., code.a.outcode, so that it logs to codestderrcode, then I get the expected outputp  precodeLog opened. Parent exiting. Hello World codepre  pHowever, if I do something like code.a.out temp sleep 2 cat tempcode then I getp  precodeLog opened. Hello World codepre  pSo the parent is somehow no longer writing to the file after the fork. Thats puzzle 1.p  pNow supposed I just move codeiostreambufferltiofilesinkgt logbufcode outside of main so that its a global variable. Doing that and simply running code.a.outcode gives the same expected output as in the previous case, but writing to a file e.g., temp now gives a new puzzling behaviorp  precodeLog opened. Parent exiting. Log opened. Hello World codepre  pThe line that writes Log opened. is before the codeforkcode so I dont see why that should appear twice in the output. I even put an explicit codeflushcode immediate before the codeforkcode to make sure that line of output wasnt simply buffered, and then the buffer got copied during the codeforkcode and later both copies eventually flushed to the stream... So thats puzzle 2.p  pOf course, if I comment out the whole codeforkcode process the entire section labeled as Step 2 then it behaves as expected for both file and codestderrcode output, and regardless of whether codelogbufcode is global or local to codemaincode.p  pAlso, if I switch codefilelogcode to be an codeofstreamcode instead of codestreambufferltfilesinkgtcode see commented out lines in codemaincode then it also behaves as expected for both file and codestderrcode output, and regardless of whether codefilelogcodecodelogbufcode are global or local to codemaincode.p  pSo it really seems that its an interaction between codefilesinkcode and codeforkcode producing these strange behaviors...  If anyone has ideas on what may be causing these, Id appreciate the helpp

A ThisOrThat object IS a proper implementation of IDoSomething unless theres some subtle issue Im missing.li liIt is consistent with the spirit of polymorphism. If a method is declared as returning an interface, it must return an instance of a concrete class which implements the interface. Why should it be invalid then for the same method to be declared as returning a concrete class that implements the interface The compiler can certainly verify the class implementation. And yes, I already know the compiler does not approve.li ol  pAdmittedly, 2 is a rather vague reason and I dont want to get into a philosophical discussion.

Negative 601 pI have an SSIS package that runs several SQL stored procedures, file tasks, and an xml and a script task. The final script task sends an email with an html table, and attached excel file, and an email body. I have a variable that is used to uniquely label the excel file on a daily basis as well as to uniquely label the emails subject line. This variable is simply the current date. However, the date was originally hardcoded in the variables value, but I decided instead to add an Execute SQL Task which returns and formats the current date and then populates that daily variable. The problem I am encountering is that when the variables value field is empty, the script task which sends out the email fails. Even when its not empty, the script task fails. It only succeeds when the current dates value is entered  so it only works when the value is equal to the return value of the SQL Task that populates the variable. However, the Script task grabs the SQL Tasks return value, rather than the variables hardcoded value. I know this because I can write 23 august, 2013 no caps in the variables value section and the value that is used in the email and file extension is still 23 August, 2013 capitalized  the exact return value of the SQL Task. My question is, which I have not found much helpful information on in my research, is, Why is this happening Having to write in the value on a daily basis defeats the purpose of having the SQL Task [which populates the variable] in there to begin with. Furthermore, please note that when I added the SQL task in originally, the package succeeded even with an empty variable value. It wasnt until after I had made several additions to the package that I ran into this dilemma. Any comments, suggestions, and advice will be highly appreciated. Thank you very much.p  pThe code for the failing script task is listed below The daily variable I spoke of is named InternalStrFieldingDatep  precode    public void Main              String EmailMsgBody  String.FormatltHTMLgtltBODYgtltPgt0ltPgtltPgt1ltPgtltBODYgtltHTMLgt                                             , Dts.Variables[ConfigSMTPMessageSourceText].Value.ToString                                             , Dts.Variables[InternalStrCountResultAfterXSLT].Value.ToString         MailMessage EmailCountMsg  new MailMessageDts.Variables[ConfigSMTPFrom].Value.ToString.Replace, ,                                                     , Dts.Variables[ConfigSMTPSuccessTo].Value.ToString.Replace, ,                                                     , Dts.Variables[ConfigSMTPSubjectLinePrefix].Value.ToString     Dts.Variables[InternalStrFieldingDate].Value.ToString                                                     , EmailMsgBody          Add Attachment         String filename  Dts.Variables[fileDailyReport].Value.ToString         System.Net.Mail.Attachment attachment         attachment  new System.Net.Mail.Attachmentfilename         EmailCountMsg.Attachments.Addattachment          EmailCountMsg.From.

Negative 601 pI am building a module to display html divspages which are designed to in a later stage be printed out as A4s. The area where these divs are displayed is however to small to display the full width of the divs and thus the pages and their content need to be scaled down to fit within the displayarea at hand. p  pThe children of the a4pages are styled with both set widthsheights and percentages so it would be a nice approach to use the CSS3 Tranform scale to scale the pages down just enough so that they can be displayed but this becomes problematic since the scale is done after rendering and thus creates an white area around the pages.p  pIm using jquery to rescale the pages when window is resized and will also implement this when page is loaded.p  pHow do i scale several divs within a common wrapper and also readjust the parent so that the scaled div is showed without any padding around itp  pstrongEditstrong Ive put together a simple fiddle displaying the issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net96jkU relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net96jkUa p  pcodetoBeScaledcode should display over the full width of codedisplayAreacode but still be scaled to code0.5codep

Finally I want to order it by the ratio of column player1  column player2.p  pFor instance, I have the following values in the table.p  p1 103 101p  p2 103 111p  p3 232 103p  p4 223 111p  pMy query would return..p  pPlayer 223 10p  pPlayer 232 10p  pPlayer 103 21p  pPlayer 101 01p  pPlayer 111 02p  pI know for the unique IDs I can do something like thisp  precodeselect  SELECT groupconcatDISTINCT player1 FROM table as player1, SELECT groupconcatDISTINCT player2 FROM table as player2 codepre  pand I know for the order I can do something like thisp  precodeORDER BY player1  player2 DESC codepre  pIm really just having a hard time figuring out what to do once I get the unique ID and then try to get the ratios outputed and sortedp

The user should be able to see the last 8 commands by typing history and run a previous command by typing x num, where num is the number of the command, or xr to run the most recent. p

Would this be appropriatep  pAlso, the target processor is AMD64p

So when do we pass a codelistcode vs codecollectioncode vs codeiterablecode p  pObvious answer is that each subclasses keep adding more functions. So should we  keep climb up the hierarchy until the required functionality is matched  I mean if in an imaginary application only codeiteratorcode is needed then use codeIterablecode else use codeListcode  p

How would I go through all the emDiscussionsem in a emVillageem and find the top scoring emChangeem I would also have the same problem when trying it on the emProgrammeem class. And then the emNationalOfficeem class.p  pThis may be achievable through SQL or activerecord  Im not certain.p  pI hope I have made myself clear  I sometimes have issues with clarity. p  hr   h2 Edit h2  pIt has been made apparent that I have not explained the Ranks correctly. I shall now attempt to explain how they workp  pEach emConversationem has a rank. Each emConversationem is about a specific emChangeem. So, if a emConversationem about emChangeem 1 is ranked 1st in that emDiscussionem Change 1 will gain a 1st. In another emDiscussionem a emConversationem regarding emChangeem 1 is ranked 2nd. So emChangeem 1 now has a 1st and a 2nd 3 points.p  p2 emDiscussionsem each have a emConversationem that talks about emChangeem 2. One Ranks it 1st the other 3rd. emChangeem 2 has a 1st and a 3rd 4 pointsp  pOver all, emChangeem 1 was the top change  it had less points higher scoring than emChangeem 2.p  pHopefully that is clear. a hrefhttpsgithub.comJragonOTIS relnofollowThisa is the full application on github, just for context.p

Negative 601 pThis is a really general learningbased question, not a technical problem.p  pIm making a game in Unity.  The game involves a lot of pretty complex, highobjectcount processes, and as such, I generate a lot of garbage.  As everyone who makes games that use managed code knows, garbage collection spikes are a HUGE buzzkill.  I am also trying to target mobile devices, so this pain is amplified.p  pMy goal is simple track down the procedures that generate the most garbage and pool and reuse the objects involved in order to reduce the load on the garbage collector.  I have tackled all of the obvious classes, but my GC issues persist.  If anyone can offer some greater wisdom here, please bring it on.p  pWhat I have been unable to track down in my research is a good way to measure GC load and track down problem spots in the code itself.  I can get metrics from Unity and from diagnostics classes about the size of the memory pool though Im no expert on what any of those numbers really mean and I can display the total number of GC collections that have happened since the start, but my knowledge of debugging this issue kind of ends there.p  pI know there MUST be better ways to solve this problem.  Can anyone point me at the right tools or framework classes or libraries that can help me out here  Ive seen some mention of a debugger program sgen thats part of Mono, but I cant find a download or let alone a guide for how to hook it up to a Unity game.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 601 pI am new to Scala, and as a matter of fact Im quite an ignorant in Java as well and I am not interested in going any deeper in my Java knowledge. The problem is that I am using a Java API thats only available for Java the Freeling Java API.p  pNow, I have created a java class call Analyzer with only one static public method call analyze which takes a String of words all parts of a sentence and returns a java.util.ArrayList of String, in which each string has the word, lemma and tag of each of the words of this sentence using freeling.p  pNow, I understand you can use a java class inside a scala app seamlessly. I declared the package named analyzer and compiled Analyzer.java to Analyzer.class. My idea is to load this class Analyzer into the scala REPL and another time into a scala source file and use it from the scala REPL to see if it works.p  pI mean, I want to do something like this in the Scala REPLp  precodescalagt import analyzer.Analyzer scalagt val result java.util.ArrayList[String]  Analyzer.analyzeThe cat eats fish scalagt printlnresult.get0 The the DT codepre  pThe problem is that when I try to import the package, it gives me an errorp  precodescalagt import analyzer.Analyzer ltconsolegt7 error not found value analyzer    import analyzer.Analyzer codepre  pEven though I start scala with the classpath option pointing to the directory where Analyzer.class is.p  pIs this possible How should I do itp

Negative 601 pIve been doing some research into Youtubes new HTML 5 player and DASH implementation. Im starting work with Wireshark and utilities like DummyNet to see how the bitrate reacts with changes in bandwidth. But before I can get into this I need to better understand the packets Im seeing. Im mainly looking for help decoding the GET requests. I have been filtering my Wireshark captures by http.request.method  GET and following the TCP streams. I see that the parameters are clen, dur, gcr, gir, id, ip, ipbits, itag, lmt, source, upn, expire. Some are straightforward others are not. I am most confused about clen, upn, lmt, and a param labeled mt which is not listed as a sparam. I am most interested in finding the bitrate requested. But am now confused as to whether Im looking in the right place. clen is the only field which could be seen as a value in Mbps. But the value often doesnt comply with what youtube lists as possible bitrates for certain qualities. They are also seemingly odd values for bitrates. Here is a sample request URL p  precodehttpr15snp5qlsney.googlevideo.comvideoplaybacklmt1389519273541060ampsourceyoutubeampexpire1394008508ampsver3ampdur191.692ampitag243ampupndPjd90tRg4oampidoANPasmTbKbiei84oPQpCjzKQT9ypEOEBqSpq3YmfDmZampfexp9063732C9319422C9349132C9166122C9374172C9374162C9134342C9369102C9369132C9029072C9340222C33000212C33001142C33001312C33001372C33001642C33103662C33106282C3310649ampgiryesampsignature898DF292EE99A453258333B40880CC72BCE453D1.DB976A3B1EB55CF43C36F6FFF2AF329FAD2E9EE4ampsparamsclen2Cdur2Cgir2Cid2Cip2Cipbits2Citag2Clmt2Csource2Cupn2Cexpireampipbits0ampip128.226.230.194ampkeyyt5ampclen4951576ampcpnBzQtGIscpjryZJ1Dampalryesampmimevideo2Fwebmampratebypassyesampredirectcounter1ampcmsredirectyesampmsnxuampmt1393986619ampmvmamprange17377542707644ampkeepaliveyes codepre  pI am using Google Chrome as a browser and making sure that all videos I inspect are using the HTML5 player with DASH active.p

Negative 601 pWhat is the best way to create an AngularJS Service that uses Autobahn.js 0.8.1 to implement WAMP v1 WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol Ideally, I would like the websocket to be accessible even when the route changes without reinitializing the connection.p  pThis is an internal app that can not communicate with the internet, so PubNub is not an option. It would also be helpful to avoid rewriting Autobahn if at all possible.p  pThere does not appear to be an AngularJS WAMP library available, but that would be a welcomed alternative.p  pThe issue revolves around the initial connection to the Websocket taking roughly 150ms.

However not all of our code is 4.5 so the inner parts of our app libraries, infrastructure needs to stay on 4.0 at the moment.

If I switch PostProcess to Funccodeltint,int,Taskcode instead and call as PostProcess1,2.Wait then I deadlock.  Is there a way to accomplish in mixed 4.54.0 code like thisp

Negative 601 pI have a problem dealing with deprecated since C11 default generation of copy constructor and copy assignment operator when there is a userdefined destructor.p  pFor most sufficiently simple classes defaultgenerated constructors, operators and destructor are fine.

Negative 601 pIt is a common practice for Restful resources to support field selectors in the query string. For example, if a resource has fields A,B,C and D but the client is interested only in a subset of fields say A and B then the Url might look like p  blockquote   p...resource1fieldsA,B  only A and B are selectedp blockquote  pNow supposed we add another property to the resource. The thing with this property is that it does not have any physical storage. It is a computed value. Also suppose that this emcomputation is very expensiveem.p  pNow obviously, Rest does not care about such things, whether data comes from a file a DB or a fancy algorithm.p  pBut here comes a dilemma the fields query parameter is always optional. In my case, omitting fields means bring all the fields much like  in SQLp  blockquote   p...resource1  A,B,C,D and Expensive are selectedp blockquote  pI am positive that there are many existing clients that are  using the naive approach not bothering to specify an explicit list of fields. This means that adding this new heavy property will unintentionally create a performance break possibly a very severe one. p  pWhat are the common techniques to cope with these situationsp  pAlternatives I consideredp  ol liAdd a special notion to the system that says that querying with  semantics will not necessarily return ALL the fields heavy fields will be omitted by default. If a client wants them he must ask for them emexplicitlyemli liNot to model these extra properties as fields on the resource. Instead expose a dedicated endpoint that will carry out the computation, thus eliminating possible confusion but introducing RestRPC style into the system.li liMake it the cilents problem if he did not bother to be explicit in the first place, tough for him. That is not really an option dont have this privilege.li ol

This means myints is of a different type to a pointer. Is its type array of intsp  pWhere is myints the emthingem that is myints, not the values in its array stored, and how can I reveal its address if it always automatically dereferences to the location the array is stored at unlike the pointer returned with the C style new arrayp  pAre these represented in memory in a functionally different wayp  pAny tips or directions to documentation that can really solidify my understanding here would be much appreciated.

Negative 601 pI am really quite new to development in Python in general, let alone testing with pytest. My problem is that the pytest collection phase runs unusually slow.

Negative 601 pI have a set of subclasses that should all define an attribute codexcode that should either evaluate to True or False.  In order to catch bugs when I forget to set this value in a subclass, I would like to set it in its superclass to a value for which truth evaluation results in an error.

Negative 601 pI am practicing my jQuery skills by building a simple slider with 3 slides.

The file types are not limited  so far it has appeared in .scss, .html, .php and .js files. Its particularly annoying when editing .scss files as it returns string errors in the command line when running a sass watch and so breaks the SASS to CSS compiling. It is not always obvious, the watch error will be returned and i must close my source file and reopen to see the control character. p  pimg srchttps15.postimg.orgeil3vea63sublimenulcharacter.png altp  pAny help diagnosing this annoying issue is much appreciated.p

Negative 601 pI have a Rails app Im testing that uses constraints to define a subdomain cgc for certain routes. Locally, everything works as expected. Pushing my code to the staging app on Heroku however, the subdomain doesnt work.p  pIve tried setting up CNAME records so that codestaging.ourwebsite.comcode points to codeourapp.herokuapp.comcode, and another CNAME record for codecgc.staging.ourwebsite.comcode that also points to codeourapp.herokuapp.comcode. Both of these domains have also been added to the app itself in Heroku, and both are routing to the index of the application. The end result I would like is for the cgc subdomain to be handled by Rails so that cgc.staging.ourwebsite.com goes to the intended pages.p  pIf all goes well in staging, the final home for the apps will be codeourwebsite.comcode and codecgc.ourwebsite.comcode respectively  not sure if this impacts the potential solutions.p

Negative 601 pIve been learning php for a fair while now. Recently I moved to oop programming in php and yet even more recently, Ive been trying to learn MVC structuring whilst doodling around and studying and putting things together... One question that Ive been having problems with recently, is working out just how this whole autoloading, using namespaces and autoloading files from multiple directories work. For example, Ive in the passed been using this technique to autoload from multiple directories...p  precodefunction autoloadclassName  extensions  array.lib.php, .controller.php, .model.php paths  arraylibs, controllers, models foreach paths as path      filename  path . DIRECTORYSEPARATOR . className     foreach extensions as ext          if isreadablefilename . ext              requireonce filename . ext             break                codepre  p splautoloadregisterautoloadp  panyway.. one problem im having though, is how I could instead use namespaces or something because Ive heard that its not new practise to name files as such as for example... index.controller.php or index.model.php or index.view.php or once again index.lib.php but rather use namespaces or something rather which I havent been able to properly grasp how to tie together with autoloading now... For anybody curious. Just for the sake of autoloading and learning this, Ive currently got my directories set up like this. p  pMYMVCbr  controllersbr  libsbr  modelsbr  viewsbr  .htaccessbr  index.phpp  pbr br  Im sorry that Ive really probably worded this pretty poorly and I really hope that somebody at all can really even understand where Im coming from or see what Im getting at even at all... I appreciate any help or knowledge you guys can share, as Ive asked questions on stackoverflow in the passed and have always received great help. Thanks guys for even taking the time to read this if youve actually read this far  have a great day toop  pAside from this. Im really just trying to study php as best as I can and only use proper coding and coding practices, because I dont just want to be a coder who knows some sloppy code, but understands and writes beautiful code  Im slowly getting there I think after months n months now, but I know its really going to take heaapsss longer before Im at a standard that I really am happy with ]p

I did it like thisp  precodefor dictmyDicts in myArray   dict[distance]  5   codepre  pOr even specifically making sure 5 is a double with many different approaches including e.g.p  precodefor dictmyDicts in myArray   let numberFive  Double  5  dict[distance]  numberFive   codepre  pAll my attempts cause an errorp  precode lvalue T5 is not identical to String, Double codepre  pIt seems to be acting as if the Dictionaries inside were immutable let rather than var. So I randomly tried thisp  precodefor var dictmyDicts in myArray   dict[distance]  5   codepre  pThis removes the error and the key is indeed assigned 5 within the for loop, but this doesnt seem to actually modify the array itself in the long run.

Negative 601 pThroughout my app, im frequently being given a number that represents the day of the week so 17 representing sunday, monday, tues, etc. A user might have a preference for a particular day saved and associated with their profile, but its always stored as that number.p  pThe thing is, I always need to convert it to the name of that day of the week. So if the users setting is 1, I need to write Sunday.p  pWhat would be a good way to do this The app is targeted for English only, and maybe would be used by Spanish speakers. But you never know, rightp  pBased on that, would it be best to simply invoke the whole nsdate and calendar and date parts and the whole song and dance to constantly get back the name of the day of the week from a number or would it be faster to be a hack about things, and literally have some static utility function that returns Sunday when passed 1, Monday when passed 2, etc. Obviously I would use localized strings for this, but my thought was it might be faster than repeatedly using the date parts.p

Negative 601 pMy website returns information for items which it takes from disk involving some logic located in the controller, so it is not just static assets.

This means that in order to change a SIN for a given participant, one has to add a new participant in a previous step, and the system reports the newly created participants and prompt the user to enter further information details such as the date of birth. When the datetime picker closes, an ajax is called to find this match as explained above.emp      pemHowever, the code selecting the new SIN number item, doesnt work as expected.

Negative 601 pI have to write a TCP server program that holds an integer, that should be modifiable by the client programs. It should kind of resemble a bankaccount.

All other messages are transferred completely and correctly.p  pIn line 49, the welcoming message is first copied to a chararray and then written to the socket. This is where the error is... Only the first 15 letters are sent different each time a new client connects.

Negative 601 pIm currently reading up on the Microsoft Unity Application Block in order to use it in one of my personal project. I have read a couple of articles and tutorials about it, but I have a question about it.p  pIn a hrefhttpwww.lmtech.itBlogpost20110909InversionofControlwithMicrosoftsUnityApplicationBlock.aspx relnofollowthis example about the frameworka, they use Unity in order to create an object that inherits the codeIVehiclecode interface. Those 3 classes that do inherit from it dont have any properties that have to be initialized in the constructor, so everything works well.p  pObviously, in my project, this wont always be the case. Ill have some classes that do need property or field initialization in the constructor. My question is, how would I achieve that Or is that something Unity cant do by itself I would have to create the object using Unitys codeResolvecode function that would give me an object with uninitialized fieldsproperties, and then I would have to call the setter one by one on each fieldspropertiesp

Negative 601 pFollowing up on this questionanswerbr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10437058howtomakeentityframeworkdatacontextreadonlyHow to make Entity Framework Data Context Readonlyap  pThe solution is to make your DbContext collections of the type DbQuery, but that is a rather specialized type its buried down in the namespaces for EF.p  pSo, whats the functional difference between have a DbContext with thisp  precodepublic DbQueryltCustomergt Customers      get  return SetltCustomergt.AsNoTracking   codepre  pvs thisp  precodepublic IQueryableltCustomergt Customers      get  return SetltCustomergt.AsNoTracking   codepre  p...the EF documentation is very light when it comes to the DbQuery class, but I prefer the idea of having DbContext made up of interfaces rather than classes so Id like to avoid it. What additional benefits does the DbQuery class providep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter reading the answers and just looking at the code I realized my question was a little silly. I was too quick to ask before I thought Obviously the underlying concrete object will be a DbQuery regardless, so the actually inner functionality will be the same. It seems to me that using IQueryable is the better choice. Thanks for your patiencep

Negative 601 pI have been working on a below sample code p  precodepublic class GlobalStaticMultithread extends Thread  private static int threadcounter  0  public void run      threadcounter      System.out.printlnthreadcounter  public static void mainString[] args       forint i  0  i lt 3  i              new GlobalStaticMultithread.start           System.out.printlnthreadcounter    main ending  codepre  p    brbr It is very clear three threads with each having its own lock for the class strongGlobalStaticMultithreadstrong will be started. My peers explanation for this program is, After Thread1 starts the static variable strongemthreadcounteremstrong which is an int will be incremented to value 1. Before it gets printed there is every chance OS will preempts Thread1 and runs Thread2, it Thread2 will hold value 1 for strongemthreadcounteremstrong and it will increment to 2 and it gets printed I mean Thread2 will print before Thread1 prints value of strongemthreadcounteremstrong as 2. I am very clear on this theory and I clearly know the difference between static and nonstatic variables. brbrThere is some subtleness which I am not able to understand how these threads getting values for strongemthreadcounteremstrong. My contention here is when Thread1 started, it has it own local cache, so it should only look at its own local cache unless the strongemthreadcounteremstrong is marked as volatile. When OS preempts Thread1 just before it prints the value and let Thread2 to run, Thread2 incremented strongemthreadcounteremstrong to 2. How the Thread1 got the value of strongemthreadcounteremstrong as 2  and Shouldnt Threads fetch values from their own cache . Because, when OS preempts Thread1, it is holding value of strongemthreadcounteremstrong as 1 in its own cache and it should print strongemthreadcounteremstrong as 1. brbr I am missing something about JVM heap and threads local cache, hence I had to post this question. I know static member variables are associated with class and they have give constant value for all objects in a program in other words if two objects of a class using static member variable strongemint i0emstrong and one object increments to strongemiemstrong then second object will get the updated value, which is 1 in this case. And I also knew the static member variables are stored in heap of JVM. brbrAnd also I knew when JVM starts it loads each started thread with its own copy of cache and that cache will hold all values of the class members. p

Negative 601 pI have a python 2.7 program running as a windows service that receives messages from clients, interacts with the MySQLv5.6 database running locally, and passes messages or files back to the clients. I am using SQLAlchemy0.9 to interact with the database.

The thread closes the session and socket connection.p  pEverything runs pretty well, but I have a couple of identical same select, same return queries that are run on every thread. In this case, they are very fast lt10 row tables fetching all values and are used to setup some objects for use in the thread types of components that are unchanging for my application, for example.p  pstrongSince these queries are run identically and return the same values every time, I was wondering if there was some way to eliminate the database call on every thread, and either ping the database once on initialization of the main program and share the objects, or hardcode the objects since I know their value is fixed.strong My thoughts so far on a few topics relating to thisp  ul liI know MySQL has the ability to cache results, but I dont want this to have a negative affect on other queries, and am not an expert in database profiling.

If its invalid, well manually add an error the form so that isValid ends up returning false later one         files  app[request]gtfilesgtgetaddformgtgetName          if files[images][0]  null              foreach files[images] as image                  if.jpg  substrimagegtgetClientOriginalName, 4                      addformgtgetimagesgtaddErrornew SymfonyComponentFormFormErrorOnly .jpg allowed                                              Form was submitted process it     addformgthandleRequestapp[request]        Form is valid     if addformgtisValid            Add blogpost to database and save images             Render the template with the form     return app[twig]gtrenderadminblogadd.twig, array         user gt app[session]gtgetuser,         addform gt addformgtcreateView        codepre  pAnd the part to upload images in my twig file looks like thisp  precodeltdiv classformgroupgt      formlabeladdform.images       formwidgetaddform.images,  fullname addform.images.vars.fullname  [], attr   multiple multiple         formerrorsaddform.images  ltdivgt codepre  pI seriously dont get what Im doing wrong. I did a vardump of addformget[images] and the error was definitely in there, but when I try a dump of addform.images in my twigfile, theres no sign of the error. So ofcourse it wont display the error.p  pAnother problem Im having is that the form is still valid after the error is added. So I guess adding an error manually doesnt make a form invalidp
Negative 601 pIm a beginner and I have a problem with JUnit test in the constructor of a class.p  pThe class that I want to test is called IntSortedArray and is as followsp  precodepublic class IntSortedArray       private int[] elements      private int size        public IntSortedArray          this.elements  new int[16]         this.size  0           public IntSortedArrayint initialCapacity throws IllegalArgumentException          ifinitialCapacity lt 0              throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionError  You cant create an array of negative length.                  else              elements  new int[initialCapacity]             size  0                    public IntSortedArrayint[] a          elements  new int[a.length  16]         forint i  0 i lt a.length i             elements[i]  a[i]         size  a.length         insertionSortelements           other code...   codepre  pWith Eclipse I created a class for JUnitp  precodepublic class IntSortedArrayUnitTest       private IntSortedArray isa      Test     public void testConstructorArray16Elements          isa  new IntSortedArray         int expected  0         forint i isa.elements lt ERROR          expected  1         assertEqualsexpected, 16        codepre  pI started to write a test class with the intention to test all the methods of the class codeIntSortedArraycode, including constructors.p  pThe first method codetestConstructorArray16Elementscode wants to test the first builder. So I thought I would check if the creation of the array elements is done properly, so the for loop counts how long codeelementscode and make sure it along 16 as required.p  pBut Eclipse generates rightly a mistake because codeelementscode is codeprivatecode. How can I fix this error I dont want to put the codepubliccode field and if possible I would like to avoid creating a method codepublic int[] getElementscode.p  pWhat do you recommendp  pAnother question I can do two assert the same method One to test the length of the array and the other to test that codesizecode is 0.p  pI hope not to have made big mistakes, this is the first time I use JUnit.p  pPS how can I test the second constructorp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 601 pSo what I am trying to accomplish here is to run a script in seleniumIDE automatically from the click of a button or a desktop shortcut preferably. Right now, I have seleniumIDE installed in firefox and each time, I am having to open my script manually on seleniumIDE and then having to click on Run Test Case for my script to get it working. I trying to avoid these steps and instead maybe lets say run the script directly from the click of just one button. If someone could give me any idea or anything, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much in advance.p

Negative 601 pIm writing a code in which I check a given directory for new files or directories. New in my situation is regarded to last time the code has been run in that directory. So I create a log file and then I acquire the log in a string vector. The code is the followingp  precodeifstream Finp string directory vector ltstringgt newfilelist  system ls B directory gt directoryfilelist.log.cstr  Finp.open directoryfilelist.log.cstr  while  true     string stmp   Finp gtgt stmp   if Finp.eof  break   newfilelist.pushback stmp   codepre  pNow whats happening is the followingp  p1 if the log filelist.log already exists, everything runs smoothlyp  p2 if the log filelist.log does not exist, it is correctly created but when the code opens the file and starts acquiring it, it gets stuck in a loop and the stmp string is endlessly empty as if the file has no eof and yet is empty. what is intresting is the fact that if I place a random system command before opening the log everything runs smoothlyp  pWhat am I missingp

Negative 601 pUp to now, Ive been using codevoid code as a way to encapsulate private data in C. The idea is  the user should not bother with the internal, and just request exposed functions.p  pHence for example p  precodetypedef void myPrivateType  myPrivateType createMPtint someArg int doSomethingmyPrivateType mpt, int someOtherArg void freeMptmyPrivateType mpt codepre  pThis works well at hiding the internal of codemyPrivateTypecode. However, there is one last minor catch  codevoidcode is so permissive, that the compiler will silently accept any kind of pointer, and not trigger any warning in case of incorrect type. This looks like a small issue, but it just increases the likelyhood that a user improperly uses the interface and lose a lot of time trying to debug whats wrong.p  pAs a consequence, Im now leaning on using a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19205018195265bjalsindex.html relnofollowincomplete typesa instead of codevoidcode, as a stricter way to control type during compilation.p  pHence the previous example becomes as follows p  precodetypedef struct foo myPrivateType  myPrivateType createMPtint someArg int doSomethingmyPrivateType mpt, int someOtherArg void freeMptmyPrivateType mpt codepre  pAs you can see, almost nothing has changed, only the typedef. It works better than previous example as now, if the user provides another pointer than myPrivateType, the compiler will complain, and the error will be immediately caught.p  pThis is a fairly good alternative. Except that, in the private section of the code the code.ccode file, I will have to define what codestruct foocode is. In some cases, its quite straightforward, when such content is clearly and statically defined.p  pBut sometimes, the content of codemyPrivateTypecode depends on some variable provided at runtime, and therefore its size may vary. This is no good for a C codestructcode, which is supposed to have a defined size at compilation time.p  pAs a workaround, I could for example typedef myPrivateType this way p  precodetypedef sizet myPrivateType codepre  porp  precodetypedef sizet myPrivateType[]    equivalent codepre  pThis let the possibility to decide the size later on, as a multiple of codesizetcode. But now, codemyPrivateTypecode is more permissive, as any codesizetcode pointer will also fit the bill.p  pIm wondering if there is a way to combine both properties, with codemyPrivateTypecode being very strict, hence impossible to confuse with any other type of pointer, but the underlying private data keeping the ability to select its size at runtime.p

Negative 601 pI have a very large data set now. The response variable is binary 10. The bad population size is a very small portion of the entire data set. The good population size is 8,000,000. The bad population size that is tagged as 1 is only 7,000. p  pI used a decision tree, this decision tree would take the features as the inputs, and then would classify the individuals into either 1 or 0.p  pBecause the population size was really large. R was not able to efficiently process all data. So I decided to randomly sample some good samples. But I wanted to keep all the bad samples. So I selected 8000 good samples and included all the 7000 bad samples. Thus, I had a 15,000 samples. I randomly splited them into training and testing data set. After training the decision tree on the training set, I fitted the testing data into the trained model, the result was vary promising. p  pHowever, I am really worried how this model would work on the entire population now. Although I compared the distribution conditioned on different variables for the good samples and good populations, the distribution of the good samples wasvery consistent with the good population. p  pBecause the good samples and bad samples are equally weighted in the sampled data, the effect of the BAD is exaggerated in training the model, I am thinking that BAD will not be BAD if the entire data fit into the model, because the bad part is too tiny. do you think this is a potential failing issue for the model Do you have any suggestions to fix this problemp

Negative 601 pI am working on expanding the suspend and resume capability for Linux running on a Xilinx Zynq Soc that has dual ARM A9s using the Xilinx 2014.4 PetaLinux distribution that uses the 3.17 kernel. p  pThe distribution currently supports suspend and resume without removing power to the processors. I am working on expanding the support to include removing power to the processors while the DDR memory is in self refresh mode, then performing a warm boot and having the first stage boot loader FSBL hand control back to the Linux kernel in the correct spot to continue with the resume process.p  pI am looking for what routine to have the first stage boot loader call. I think it might be cpuresume in archarmkernelsleep.S, but I am not sure and would like to verify that it is the correct routine to be calling.p  pI am jumping to this from the FSBL after a suspend and warm boot, and single stepping through the code in a debugger. It gets past the point of turning the MMU back on, but the debugger looses connection near the end of that routine.p  pIn an effort to see if this is the correct entry point, I have modified pm.c in archarmmachzynq.c to call softrestartvirttophyscpuresume just after the resume has happened in the case where the processors are not powered off, but are woken back up with an interrupt.  The softrestart routine turns off the MMUs and clears the caches, and I am using it to get the processors into a similar state as to what they would be in if they had been power cycled. This test mostly works, and gets much further than calling cpuresume from the FSBL. The cpuresume routine expects to be called with cache and MMU off.p  pI have read the Documentationpowerdevices.txt file, and anything else I could find.p  pI have already done a version of this that uses the no OS flow to put the DDR into self refresh and power cycle the processors, and tested it on hardware. That flow does not use virtual memory.p  pThank you in advance,p  pJohnp

Negative 601 pI want to develop C a file server process under linux which is able to provide clients access to the files on a mounted USB stick.

Access to any HDD files is not allowed.pli ul  pAs I understand, a standard way to confine the file access of a process would be to use emchrootem.

Negative 601 pIve designed a core data stack based on a hrefhttpmartiancraft.comblog201503coredatastack relnofollowthis blog posta in Swift where I have two codeNSManagedObjectContextcode instances, a Main Queue Context codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode and a Private Queue Context codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode where the main contexts job is to deal with all things user interaction related editing, presenting data to the user and the private contexts only job is to write to disk.p  pTo make managing the stack as easy as possible, Ive integrated a hrefhttpsgithub.commagicalpandaMagicalRecord relnofollowMagical Recorda, a hrefhttpsgithub.comOvercoatOvercoat relnofollowOvercoata, and a hrefhttpsgithub.comMantleMantle relnofollowMantlea. Ive separated all this into two classes, a Core Data singleton stack built on Magical Record and a network manager singleton Built on Overcoat which in turn is built on Mantle.p  pThe Core Data stack looks like thisp  precodeimport UIKit import CoreData import MagicalRecord  class CoreData NSObject       enum StackType Int          case Default, AutoMigrating, iCloud, inMemory           static let sharedStack  CoreData     private override init       var type StackType  .Default      func setupStackWithTypetype StackType, withName name String  MagicalRecord.defaultStoreName          self.type  type         switch self.type          case .Default             MagicalRecord.setupCoreDataStackWithStoreNamedname         case .AutoMigrating             MagicalRecord.setupCoreDataStackWithAutoMigratingSqliteStoreNamedname         case .iCloud             if let documentsPath  NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains.DocumentDirectory, .UserDomainMask, true.first                  let url  NSURLfileURLWithPath documentsPath                 MagicalRecord.setupCoreDataStackWithiCloudContainername, localStoreAtURL url              else                  printError could not find documents directory                      case .inMemory             MagicalRecord.setupCoreDataStackWithInMemoryStore                    func setupStackWithStoreNamestoreName String, automigrating Bool  true          if automigrating              MagicalRecord.setupCoreDataStackWithAutoMigratingSqliteStoreNamedstoreName          else              MagicalRecord.setupAutoMigratingCoreDataStack                    func saveWithBlockblock NSManagedObjectContext gt           MagicalRecord.saveWithBlockblock, completion              success, error in                     func cleanUp          MagicalRecord.cleanUp           var managedObjectContext NSManagedObjectContext          return NSManagedObjectContext.MRdefaultContext          var privateContext NSManagedObjectContext         return NSManagedObjectContext.MRrootSavingContext          var coordinator NSPersistentStoreCoordinator          return NSPersistentStoreCoordinator.MRdefaultStoreCoordinator           var persistentStore NSPersistentStore          return NSPersistentStore.MRdefaultPersistentStore       codepre  pMy network manager looks likep  precodeimport UIKit import Overcoat import MTLManagedObjectAdapter  class NetworkManager OVCManagedHTTPSessionManager       static let singleton  NetworkManagerbaseURL NSURLstring Config.ServerBaseEndpoint, managedObjectContext nil, sessionConfiguration          let config  NSURLSessionConfiguration.defaultSessionConfiguration         config.timeoutIntervalForRequest  15         config.timeoutIntervalForResource  15         return config           private override initbaseURL url NSURL, managedObjectContext context NSManagedObjectContext, sessionConfiguration configuration NSURLSessionConfiguration          super.initbaseURL url, managedObjectContext context, sessionConfiguration configuration         self.responseSerializer.acceptableContentTypes  [texthtml, applicationjson, applicationxml, imagepng]         self.securityPolicy  AFSecurityPolicypinningMode .None         self.securityPolicy.allowInvalidCertificates  true           required initcoder aDecoder NSCoder          super.initcoder aDecoder            MARK  OVCHTTPSessionManager      override class func modelClassesByResourcePath gt [String AnyClass]          return [Types.RestApi.Post.rawValuePost.self, Types.RestApi.Post.rawValue Post.self]        codepre  pWhat I cant quite wrap my head around is 1 how these two classes can work in conjunction and 2 in regards to the core data stack, which context to save on, what work do on on which context, etc.p  pFor codeNetworkManager.swiftcode which takes a codeNSManagedObjectContextcode to persist models top  pWhich context do I initialize the manager with My assumption would be if you make a network request and that JSON gets transformed into intermediate codeMantlecode models and from there into codeNSManagedObejctcode instances, those instances should be saved right to the Private Queue Context, bypassing the Main Queue Context altogether in this instance.p  pWhen talking about codeCoreData.swiftcodep  p1 Magical Record has the codesaveWithBlockcode method which creates a local context and propagates it up to the root context in this case the root context is the Private Queue Context but its unclear to be what work should be done inside the block. p  pIn their documentation, they give this examplep  precodePerson person  ...  [MagicalRecord saveWithBlockNSManagedObjectContext localContext    Person localPerson  [person MRinContextlocalContext]   localPerson.firstName  John   localPerson.lastName  Appleseed  ] codepre  pwhere they create a codePersoncode object outside of the save block and then remake the entity in the local context then edit its properties. However in my case, all codePersoncode objects would be an instance of codeMTLModelcode, not codeNSManagedObjectcode. When I create some model object, since it isnt a core data object, it wouldnt be inserted into any sort of context until I use codeMTLManagedObjectAdaptercode to transform the model into an codeNSManagedObjectcode instance.p  pThe best way to go about it seems to be create the codeMTLModelcode instances, do whatever editing is needed, and then either 1 inside codesaveWithBlockcode insert the newly created managed objects right into the local context and let it propagate up or 2 insert the objects into the Private Queue Context and save.p  p2 Do I really need to use the Main Queue Context at all for saving and editing As I said before, Mantle has the model classes as a subclass of codeMTLModelcode and later maps them into codeNSManagedObjectcode instances so it makes sense that I could just save directly to the Private Queue Context whose only job is to write to disk anywayp  p3 If I dont need to use the Main Queue Context for savingediting, wouldnt it become the context I use for fetching codeNSManagedObjectscode given that the Private Queues job is to write to disk and the savingediting functions of the Main Queue Context seem to be made obsolete by Mantles intermediate model structure p
