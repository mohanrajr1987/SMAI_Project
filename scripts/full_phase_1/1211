Positive 1211 pThis should be a common problem with a solution but I havent managed to find it anywhere.p  pI am defining a global exception handler using ControllerAdvice, I define a new ModelAndView and redirect to my error page.  Works great EXCEPT for the fact that now we want to add a link to go back to the original page which of course could vary depending on where the error originated.p  pWhat I want to do is to store some kind of context information about the controller that generated the error, for instance if its MyController then I can access a value via MyController.EXCEPTIONREDIRECTURL and generate the appropriate link.p  pI find a lack of context information in the Exception handler rather limiting.p
Positive 1211 pI have a pretty large transaction, annotated with codeTransactionalcode. There are a few longrunning queries in it, but usually runs fine.

Even worse, the transaction is not rolling back.p  pJDBC commits by default on connection close. However, Spring should be setting the Connections autocommit to false using something like the following before opening the transaction a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16301315springtransactionalandjdbcautocommitSpring Transactional and JDBC autoCommita. Ive confirmed that the version we are using still does this.

Positive 1211 pI know that this is a long shot question, but I cannot tell if Im even on the right path. I have an object codePcode and it has needs 30 codeManyToOnecode relationships.  I am trying to pull a list of 2500 records. I notice that if I request the data codeEAGERLYcode it takes about 60 seconds. if I request the data codeLAZILYcode it only take 5 seconds to get the data but then it takes about 55 seconds to loop through the list in my jsp I am displaying all fields of object codePcode. I understand that 30 relationships this way are a lot. I am ok with it taking 60 seconds as I plan to paginate the page anyway. My question is, Do these speeds sound normal good or does it sound like I am missing important optimization p  pany pointer would be help  I have been looking into this all week and really need any kind of help.p  pThanks.p

Positive 1211 pI need to run multiple singlethread jobs simultaneously in a production environment using Spring Batch. In a near future, I may need to run jobs with multithreaded steps, too. I dont need persistence of the Sp Batch datasource, so I want to use an inmemory HSQLDB database. Are the basic options of transaction control and isolation level enough for Sp Batch to run without concurrency problems I think that LOCKS transaction control and READ COMMITTED isolation should be enough but I didnt found any minimal specification in the Sp Batch documentation and want to be sure. Any personal experiences Thanks in advance.p

Positive 1211 pI have created a springboot based java application that uses springs tasks.  This is a console based java application that also uses hibernate to access database.  This application is based on a spring sample for tasks and uses annotations instead of configuration files. For hibernate, I am actually using hibernate.cfg.xml and am initializing the hibernate session factory myself.p  pI wanted to use Springs declaration transaction management but they are not working because I have not been able to find sample of how to initialize spring session factory through annotations.  All samples show configuration through a configuration files.  Can anybody point to how to initialize hibernate session factory through spring using annotations and code so that springs declarative transactions would work.p  pThanks in advance.p  pWaqarp

Positive 1211 pSo, Im using a Hibernate DAO with Spring. My DAO is going to be constructed by the ApplicationContext IOC container, and the SessionFactory is going to be injected by the container LocalSessionFactoryBean.p  pNow, this DAO is going to be a singleton, used for all CRUD operations in my program, with a pool of database connections behind it. My concern is about the thread safety of the sessionFactory field.p  pMy understanding of thread safety is that all state fields need to be guarded in a multithreaded environment. Now, the use of this class will be that Spring will set the SessionFactory upon bean creation, and that factory wont be changed after that. This means that TECHNICALLY it could function safely in a multithreaded environment, but I feel thats a very risky practice, to just operate on the assumption that the setter method wont be called again.p  pThe thing is, synchronizing the SessionFactory would require all calls to it to be synchronized as well. So the insertPortfolio method I put in below would need to be synchronized as well, which defeats the purpose of having a pool of available connections to the database, since access will be limited to one thread at a time.p  pI guess the best solution I can think of is to change this from setter injection to constructor injection, and make the SessionFactory field final. But Im trying to understand the broader issues at stake here, so I can make good multithreaded safety decisions with spring in the future.p  precodeprivate SessionFactory sessionFactory  public HibernatePortfolioDao   public void setSessionFactorySessionFactory sessionFactory     this.sessionFactory  sessionFactory   Override public void insertPortfolioPortfolioModel portfolioModel      sessionFactory.getCurrentSession.saveportfolioModel  codepre

Negative 1211 pHavent been able to find anything particular to this situation online so here i go... I need to setget the cookies stored at first.com while browsing second.com, I have full access of first.com but i only have javascript access can manipulate the DOM as i want on second.com.p  pMy first approach was to create an iframe on second.com with js that loaded a page like first.comdoAjaxsetCookiexxx and that did an ajax call to say first.comsetCookiecookieDataxxx which would set the cookie on first.com with the data we passed around. p  pThat pretty much worked fine for setting the cookie on first.com from second.com  for getting a cookie I basically followed the same procedure, created the iframe that loaded first.comdoAjaxgetCookie and that would do an ajax call to say first.comgetCookie which would read the cookie info on first.com and return it as a JSON object. p  pThe problem is that Im unable to bring that JSON cookie object back to second.com so I can read it, well maybe i could just bring it when the Ajax call is complete using window.top but theres timing issues because its not relative to when the iframe has been loaded. I hope i am clear and was wondering if theres an easier solution rather than this crazy iframeajax crap, also seems like this wont even work for getting cookies in SAFARI.p
Negative 1211 pAndreas Hubers answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions405600detectingthatathreadpoolworkitemhascompletedwaitingforcompletionthis questiona gave me an idea to implement codeConcurrentltTgtcode with async delegates instead of the ThreadPool.

Unfortunately, this case doesnt seem to be covered at MSDN or anywhere I could find.

Negative 1211 pIn subsystem design, I sometimes see software designs that have one highlevel class that has only one feature It routes a call from a client using the class to another a certain class the client would like to use. However, it alone does not have any functionality. Take this scenariop  pSay there are five classes in the bowling alley subsystem An alley, a lane, a bowler, control desk, and a score. Anytime a client outside the subsystem wants any data to display to a user, it would communicate only to the control desk the router that would call any of the classes it holds to get the clients requested data a score for example Client calls control desk with getScore, which calls a Lanes getScore, which calls a Bowlers getScore.p  pI understand this is a bad design decision, but Id like to hear realworld examples with consequences you discovered of having this router class Can also be known as a middleman. What issues did you run into as the system you were working on evolved What arguments would you make to persuade software designers to avoid router classesp
Negative 1211 pbr Im really new to VSTO so sorry if this is a newbie question.p  pIm working on a data entry application where I need to have the user get data into an excel table e.g. when you highlight a bunch of rows and click Format As Table, then I need to read the data in from that table and work with it in C.p  pAt a basic level, Ive got a schema in C in some format.  I need to create a table in Excel in that format Column Names  Validation rules on the types.   Some of the types are enums so I presume I need to create a list on another sheet with all enum values and specify that list for the binding.  Once the table is created, the user goes about entering data, and when they close excel, I read the data out.

Negative 1211 pstrongUPDATEstrong I found a solution. See my Answer below.p  h2My Questionh2  pHow can I optimize this query to minimize my downtime I need to update over 50 schemas with the number of tickets ranging from 100,000 to 2 million. Is it advisable to attempt to set all fields in ticketsextra at the same time I feel that there is a solution here that Im just not seeing. Ive been banging my head against this problem for over a day.p  pAlso, I initially tried without using a sub SELECT, but the performance was emmuchem worse than what I currently have.p  h2Backgroundh2  pIm trying to optimize my database for a report that needs to be run. The fields I need to aggregate on are very expensive to calculate, so I am denormalizing my a hrefhttpsgist.github.com82b992328d6d32d00d9cexisting schemaa a bit to accommodate this report. Note that I simplified the tickets table quite a bit by removing a few dozen irrelevant columns.p  pMy report will be aggregating ticket counts by strongManager When Createdstrong and strongManager When Resolvedstrong. This complicated relationship is diagrammed herep  pimg srchttpcdn.cloudfiles.mosso.comc163801eav.png altEAV p  pTo avoid the half dozen nasty joins required to calculate this onthefly Ive added the following table to my schemap  precodemysqlgt show create table ticketsextraG  1. row         Table ticketsextra Create Table CREATE TABLE ticketsextra    ticketid int11 NOT NULL,   managercreated int11 DEFAULT NULL,   managerresolved int11 DEFAULT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY ticketid,   KEY managercreated managercreated,managerresolved,   KEY managerresolved managerresolved,managercreated  ENGINEMyISAM DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 1 row in set 0.00 sec codepre  pThe problem now is, I havent been storing this data anywhere.

Negative 1211 pI am new to iphone development. I am old School  I was tought to use Procedures etc. when programming. Everything is object oriented these days but my style is still as its always been. Please bear that in mind. My project is tiny and really just a proof of concept.p  pThe program below works on a timer  every 30 seconds it will read a random baby name from my list of names database stored in Dictionary.plist by my app. It then shows this name on the iphone screen.p  pYou can see the full relevant parts of the code below. What happens is   if I increase the timer to run it very fast  eventually it seems to run out of memory or something as it just shows  instead of the next random baby name.

Negative 1211 pI have a multisite Drupal6 installation containing websites of different customers.p  pOn each site, there is an administrator role that includes mainly the customers account. We want to give as many permissions as possible to this privileged user, but this could bring to security leaks using just the Drupal Core permissions management system.p  pThe main thing to avoid is the customer account being able to run PHP code on the server that would be like being logged on the server as the wwwdata user.. sounds really bad.p  pTo avoid that, it is not sufficient to deny PHP code evaluation for the role. Since the administrator role must have permissions to manage users, he could also change the password of the user 1 and login in the site as superadmin.p  pThe second goal would be to deny also some confusing administrative pages such as module selection but not others such as site informations configuration, or theme selection, etc.p  pI found the a hrefhttpdrupal.orgprojectuserone relnofollowUser Onea module that seems to fix the first problem, but I have no idea on how to solve the second one. I found some modules around, but noone seems to fit.. it seems like the most ACLs are thought to protect strongthe contentstrong, and not the site itself, as if the site administrator would always be the server owner itself..p

Negative 1211 pGreetings all, Im looking for a more efficient way to grab multiple users without too much code redundancy.p  pI have a Users class, heres a highly condensed representationp  precode    Class Users       function construct  ... ...       public static function getNewid             This is all only example code          sql  SELECT Name,Email,Etc.. FROM Users WHERE UserID            Retrieval using prepared statements would go here          user  new User          usergtsetIDid          ....           return user    public static function getNewestUserscount       sql  SELECT UserID,Name,Email,Etc..

I would much rather select all users in a single SQL statement.p  pThe problem is that I have probably a dozen or so methods for getting arrays of users, so all of these would now need to know the names of the database columns which is repeating a lot of structure that could always change later.p  pWhat are some other ways that I could approach this problem  My goals include efficiency, flexibility, scalability, and good design practice.p

Negative 1211 pIve been pondering about the C and CIL type system today and Ive started to wonder why static classes are considered classes. There are many ways in which they are not really classesp  ul liA normal class can contain nonstatic members, a static class cant. In this respect, a class is more similar to a emstructem than it is to a static class, and yet structs have a separate name.li liYou can have a reference to an instance of a normal class, but not a static class despite it being considered a reference type. In this respect, a class is more similar to an eminterfaceem than it is to a static class, and yet interfaces have a separate name.li liThe name of a static class can never be used in any place where a type name would normally fit you cant declare a variable of this type, you cant use it as a base type, and you cant use it as a generic type parameter. In this respect, static classes are somewhat more like emnamespacesem.li liA normal class can implement interfaces. Once again, that makes classes more similar to emstructsem than to static classes.li liA normal class can inherit from another class.li ul  pIt is also bizarre that static classes are considered to derive from emSystem.Objectem. Although this allows them to inherit the static methods emEqualsem and emReferenceEqualsem, the purpose of that inheritance is questionable as you would call those methods on emobjectem anyway. C even allows you to specify that useless inheritance explicitly on static classes, but not on interfaces or structs, where the implicit derivation from emobjectem and emSystem.ValueTypeem, respectively, actually has a purpose.p  pstrongRegarding the subsetoffeatures argumentstrong Static classes have a subset of the features of classes, but they also have a subset of the features of structs. All of the things that make a class distinct from the other kinds of type, do not seem to apply to static classes.p  pstrongRegarding the emtypeofem argumentstrong Making a static class into a new and different kind of type does not preclude it from being used in emtypeofem.p  pGiven the sheer oddity of static classes, and the scarcity of similarities between them and normal classes, shouldnt they have been made into a separate kind of type instead of a special kind of classp
Negative 1211 pStrange situation I am trying to remove some hard coding from my code. There is a situation where I have a field, lets say CityID, and using this information, I want to find out which table contains a primary key called CityID.p  pLogically, youd say that its probably a table called City but its not... that table is called Cities. There are some other inconsistencies in database naming hence I can never be sure if removing the string ID and finding out the plural will be sufficient. p  pNote Once I figure out that CityID refers to a table called Cities, I will perform a join to replace CityID with city name on the fly. I will appreciate if someonw can also tell me how to find out the first varchar field in a table given its name.p

Negative 1211 pI think my question is, is there anyway to emulate the behaviour that well gain from C0xs codeconstexprcode keyword with the current C standard that is if I understand what codeconstexprcode is supposed to do correctly.p  pTo be more clear, there are times when it is useful to calculate a value at compile time but it is also useful to be able to calculate it at runtime too, for e.g. if we want to calculate powers, we could use the code below.p  precodetemplateltint X, unsigned int Ygt struct xPowerYconst      static const int value  XxPowerYconstltX,Y1gtvalue   templateltint Xgt struct xPowerYconstltX, 1gt      static const int value  X   int xPowerYint x, unsigned int y      return y1  x  xxPowerYx,y1  codepre  pThis is a simple example but in more complicated cases being able to reuse the code would be helpful. Even if, for runtime performance, the recursive nature of the function is suboptimal and a better algorithm could be devised it would be useful for testing the logic if the templated version could be expressed in a function, as I cant see a reasonable method of testing the validity of the constant template method in a wide range of cases although perhaps there is one and i just cant see it, and perhaps thats another question.p  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrong Forgot to mention, I dont want to codedefinecodep  pstrongEdit2strong Also my code above is wrong, it doesnt deal with x0, but that doesnt affect the question.p

Negative 1211 pIve inherited a project consisting of three levels of code. The lowest layer is native C that interacts with hardware. This is mature, stable and welltested.

Freezing them or changing their priority seems to have no effect.p  pIve not debugged multithreaded code of this complexity before so any advice much appreciatedp

Negative 1211 pIve been working on a website on my own xampp server on my computer with my own database and everything and so far its been pretty smooth, surprisingly.  Now I want to upload it to a host, and I found a free web host and I was able to upload the site through dreamweaverftp.

Maybe if I had a file on my hosting server and a file on my local server that specified the connection information and just never messed with themp  p2 If I change something in my local DB, I have to copy the SQL and run it in my remote one as well.

Negative 1211 pThis one has been doing my head in for months  So time to swallow my pride and reach out for a little help. At the moment this is being done in UIWebView as HTML5JS controlled system. But UIWebview frankly sux and looking to make this last component native too.p  pI have a collection of videos and at specific timed points during the video, I am calling a page of instructions that relate to the timed period in the video. The video controls also act as a controller for the instructions pages. So whatever timed point is reached, the corresponding page is animated into place.p  pIve looked in many, many options, with the closest coming in with http video streaming and using timed metadata to initiate a view, but I am containing the videos locally on the device. And, as yet cannot find anything that looks like it will work. Seems simple enough in principle, but Ill be damned if I can find a decent solution...p  pAny ideas  pointersp  pHeres the last attempt at going native with this before the remainder of my hair fell out  I think I may be seeing where I was heading in the wrong direction, but if you can spare a few moments, Id really appreciate itp  pOBJECTIVE is to have a shoutOut that lives below the video that contains a page of instructions. At x seconds, the content will be refreshed to correspond to that portion of the video and persist until the next shoutOut for fresh content. This I have managed to achieve successfully. Where I have been falling down a lot is when I scrub the video back to a previous section, the shoutOut content remains at the position from which I scrubbed and remains there permanently. Or as the code is below, simply doesnt reapear as it is set to a timed visible duration.p  pAnyway, heres the code...p  pHeaderp  precode STARTimport import ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  STARTHIGHLIGHT   import ltMediaPlayerMPMoviePlayerController.hgt import CommentView.h  ENDHIGHLIGHT        STARTdef  STARTwiring interface MoviePlayerViewController  UIViewController      UIView viewForMovie      ENDwiring      STARTHIGHLIGHT       MPMoviePlayerController player      ENDHIGHLIGHT      STARTwiring     UILabel onScreenDisplayLabel     UIScrollView myScrollView     NSMutableArray keyframeTimes     NSArray shoutOutTexts     NSArray shoutOutTimes   property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIView viewForMovie  ENDwiring  STARTHIGHLIGHT property nonatomic, retain MPMoviePlayerController player  ENDHIGHLIGHT property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UILabel onScreenDisplayLabel  property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIScrollView myScrollView property nonatomic, retain NSMutableArray keyframeTimes    STARTHIGHLIGHT NSURL movieURL  voidtimerActionNSTimertheTimer  void playerThumbnailImageRequestDidFinishNSNotificationnotification  voidhandleTapFromUITapGestureRecognizer recognizer  IBAction getInfoidsender  voidremoveViewNSTimertheTimer   ENDHIGHLIGHT  STARTwiring end  ENDdef  ENDwiring  ENDimport codepre  pMainp  precodeimplementation MoviePlayerViewController  STARTsynth synthesize player synthesize viewForMovie synthesize onScreenDisplayLabel synthesize myScrollView synthesize keyframeTimes  ENDsynth      Implement loadView to create a view hierarchy programmatically, without using a nib.

Ideally the profiler would give units of interpreter bytecode ticks which would increment one per bytecode instruction. This would be a emveryem rough measure, but meets the requirements of determinism and highprecision.p  pWhich profiling system should I usep

Negative 1211 pGood morning, all.  Im looking for help with setting up a library template in strongSharePoint 2007strong.  Here are the detailsp  ul lipI have a parent site with several subsites.pli lipI want to set up a library template that can then be placed on each subsite.  These libraries are going to pull from a series of centralized lists on the parent site in order to provide metadata options.  This way, I only have to maintain one set of lists and the maintained list information will be available to each library.pli lipBecause the libraries exist on subsites of the main site, I cant use simple lookups.  A regular lookup column type only works for lists within the current site.pli lipI have access to the filtered lookup column type, and it seems like the right choice because it allows me access to the centralized lists on the parent site.pli ul  pIm looking to have the user prompted when uploading files to a library based on this template.  After selecting the file, the user is presented with the list of metadata choices to fill out.p  ul lipI want to have the first filtered lookup provide the user with a list of choices.  This currently works properly.pli lipI want the second filtered lookup to provide a filtered list of choices based on the selection in the first filtered lookup.pli lipTheres a section for a CAML query filter string, and this is where my hangup is.  How does one write a string to reference a field as opposed to a static valuepli ul  pThis is what Ive tried.  In the Apply Query Filter field, I have putp  precodeltWheregt   ltEqgt     ltFieldRef NameCategory gtltValue TypeLookupgtBlueltValuegt   ltEqgt ltWheregt codepre  pThis works, but only provides results where the value is emBlueem, a static string.

Negative 1211 pI am trying to display a single UIPickerView in my app and depending on what button is selected a UIPickView will popup and populate with the relevant data for the button selected. No sure if it matters but one UIPickerView has three columns and one has two. I can get both of them to work perfectly when the are separate but the minute that I nest them into if statements it breaks.p  pOn the third time when I select the button that fires the opposite UIPickerView it crashes and give me the error of NSRangeException and that it is trying to find the object at index 2 in an array [0...1]. My understanding is that the program thinks that there is an object in a spot in the array that doesnt exist. p  pI have tried the [picker reloadAllComponents] method and have it called each time the button is selected but as stated above that only works once and then it quits. The strange thing is that if I select the button that I pressed for the second set of code it works perfectly. It is when I select a button that would make the UIPickerView have to change its view that it crashes. p  pI am really new to iOS development and Objective C and hope that someone out there knows what I am doing wrong. I will post any code that you guys need and will post a couple samples just to understand what is going on. p  pHere is one of the buttons methods that sets an int to 2 and also calls the method to show the picker. p  precodeIBActionlinePopupPicker picker  2 [self pickerShow]  codepre  pThis code is the other method which is pretty much the same as the other I am aware that I havent implemented the UserDefaults into the second button yetp  precodeIBActionnamePicker field   1 picker  1 NSLogThe value of field isi, field NSUserDefaults pickerViewSelectionDefaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] [tipPicker selectRow[pickerViewSelectionDefaults integerForKeypickerViewSelectionKey] inComponent0 animatedNO] [tipPicker selectRow[pickerViewSelectionDefaults integerForKeypickerViewNameColor] inComponent1 animatedNO] [tipPicker selectRow[pickerViewSelectionDefaults integerForKeypickerViewNameFontSize] inComponent2 animatedNO]  [self pickerShow]  codepre  pThis is the method that calls the UIPickerView.

Negative 1211 pThis has been bugging me for about 4 hours, so I thought its time to seek some help.  I cant find anything similar online, but mainly because the values are quite specific and Im not really sure what to look for...p  pThis is a problem Im having with an Oracle script, running in SQLPlus 10.2.0.5.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pNames and real data has been changed to protect the identity of the suspects I have a table called MONKEYS and a table called MONKEYPUZZLES, which look a bit like thisp  pMONKEYSp  ul liMONKEYIDli liGIRAFFEIDli liMONKEYPUZZLEIDli ul  pMONKEYPUZZLESp  ul liMONKEYPUZZLEIDli liGIRAFFEIDli ul  pMONKEYPUZZLES.GIRAFFEID and MONKEYS.GIRAFFEID match, but there are n MONKEYS per MONKEYPUZZLE so MONKEYPUZZLES.GIRAFFEID 1 might match to MONKEY.MONKEYID 1, 2 and 334.p  pI want to set the MONKEYS.MONKEYPUZZLEID field, based on the MONKEYPUZZLES.MONKEYPUZZLEID field, because currently my MONKEYS.MONKEYPUZZLEID field is null.  I have indexes onp  ul liMONKEYS.MONKEYID primary key with indexli liMONKEYS.GIRAFFEIDli liMONKEYPUZZLES.MONKEYPUZZLEID primary key with indexli liMONKEYPUZZLES.GIRAFFEIDli ul  pI also have over 1.6 million rows in the MONKEYS table and over 50,000 rows in the MONKEYPUZZLES table.p  pI was originally using the following queryp  precodeUPDATE MONKEYS M SET M.MONKEYPUZZLEID     SELECT MP.MONKEYPUZZLEID FROM MONKEYPUZZLES MP     WHERE M.GIRAFFEID  MP.GIRAFFEID     AND MP.GIRAFFEID IS NOT NULL codepre  pHowever, this script would take about 2 minutes to get from 0 to 92.67 complete, then it took well over 25 minutes to get to 94 complete.  I eventually stopped the script.  I ran it a few times I was playing about with different indexes and DBMSSTATS, but each time it would get to 92.67 and crap out.p  pSo I thought it must be my script.  I went back to square one, ate a banana, said Oook a lot and came up with the following variation script, which is much more explicitp  precodeUPDATE MONKEYS M2 SET M2.MONKEYPUZZLEID     SELECT X.MPID FROM      SELECT M.MONKEYID MID, MP.MONKEYPUZZLEID MPID       FROM MONKEYS M INNER JOIN MONKEYPUZZLES MP       ON MP.GIRAFFEID  M.GIRAFFEID X    WHERE X.MID  M2.MONKEYID codepre  pHowever, it was rubbish.  Even with my indexes, it took well over 5 minutes just to get to 2, so I scrapped that one.p  pI then came up with the following variation, which I was pretty pleased withp  precodeUPDATE MONKEYS M SET M.MONKEYPUZZLEID     SELECT MP.MONKEYPUZZLEID     FROM MONKEYPUZZLES MP     WHERE M.GIRAFFEID  MP.GIRAFFEID     AND EXISTS       SELECT 1 FROM MONKEYPUZZLES MP2        WHERE M.GIRAFFEID  MP2.GIRAFFEID codepre  pHowever, and I really couldnt believe my eyes, this script behaved almost exactly like the first running in about 2 minutes, from 0 up to 92.67 complete, then taking absolutely ages to get any further.  What is it with 92.67p  pThe total number of blocks is 41,717, so it gets to about 38,000 blocks before it seems to significantly slow down.p  pIn case youre wondering, Im using the following query on a separate SQLPlus session to calculate the age completep  precodeSELECT X., TOCHARSYSDATE, HH24MISS TIMESTAMP    FROM select sid, serial, opname, sofar, totalwork,      roundsofartotalwork100,2  Complete from vsessionlongops X    WHERE  Complete lt 100 and totalwork gt 0 codepre  pwhich is a variation of this a hrefhttpsearchoracle.techtarget.comtipTrackingtheprogressoflongrunningqueries relnofollowhttpsearchoracle.techtarget.comtipTrackingtheprogressoflongrunningqueriesap  pPlease help put a poor tiger out of his miseryp  pP.S.

Negative 1211 pI tried searching and havent found a definitive answer to my issue. I am making the switch from SQL Server to Oracle but still using C for the front end. I am using ODP.Net. I have a stored proc in Oracle like thisp  precodeCreate or Replace Procedure GetFoo    curz OUT sysrefcursor,     pubdate   IN   varchar2,     fname      IN   varchar2 default null,     lname      IN   varchar2 default null,     phone      IN   varchar2 default null      IS   BEGIN     get some data   END codepre  pfname, lname, and phone are optional parameters. In my C code I set the OracleCommand.BindByName  true which I have read should allow me to exclude sending any parameters in which there are no values to be sent in. For example, I would just need to send in the cursor, the pubdate and phone to search for a record that matches just the phone number. However, when calling this from C though and only adding the parameters for the cursor, pubdate and phone I keep getting the error wrong number or types of arguements in call to GetFoo. Then if I send in cursor, pubdate, and fname and leave the rest empty I get results and all works well. It seems that you can not skip over any parameters regardless of the BindByName setting. If this is correct behavior then I can work around it but it seems a bit odd well at least from my SQL Server experience and I want to make sure I am not missing something.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1211 pSuppose I am designing something like the following interfacep  precodepublic interface MyInterface   public MyInterface method1   public void method2MyInterface mi  codepre  pHowever, there is the caveat that the return type for codemethod1code and the parameter for codemethod2code match the concrete implementation and not just codeMyInterfacecode.  That is, if I have codeMyInterfaceImplcode that implements codeMyInterfacecode, it needs to have the followingp  precodepublic class MyInterfaceImpl implements MyInterface   Override   public MyInterfaceImpl method1...    Override   public void method2MyInterfaceImpl mi...  codepre  pAs written above, codemethod1code wont cause any compile errors, but there is nothing guaranteeing that the return type matches in all implementations.  Of course codemethod2code wont even compile because the signature does not match the interface.p  pOne candidate solution is to use selfreferential or recursive bounds in genericsp  precodepublic interface MyInterfaceltT extends MyInterfaceltTgtgt   public T method1   public void method2T mi   public class MyInterfaceImpl implements MyInterfaceltMyInterfaceImplgt   Override   public MyInterfaceImpl method1    Override   public void method2MyInterfaceImpl mi  codepre  pThis would get me what I want with one exception other implementations might pass the wrong generic type nothing forces codeTcode to match the concrete type.  So potentially someone else could implement the followingp  precodepublic class NotMyInterfaceImpl implements MyInterfaceltMyInterfaceImplgt   Override   public MyInterfaceImpl method1    Override   public void method2MyInterfaceImpl mi   codepre  pThat would compile just fine even though codeNotMyInterfaceImplcode emshouldem implement codeMyInterfaceltNotMyInterfaceImplgtcode.  That makes me think I need something else.p  pNote that I dont think Im trying to violate LSP Im OK with the return typeparameter being subclasses of codeNotMyInterfaceImplcode.p  pSo I dont know of a clean way to do this.  That leads me to believe that I might be focusing too much on implementation details in the interface, but it doesnt seem that way to me.  Is there any way to do the type of thing I described, or is this some kind of smell that Im putting something in an interface that doesnt belong therep

The following character, uppercase codeBcode, is emShiftBem or 16, 66.

Negative 1211 pI get an access violation inside wxThreads startup function when it calls EnterCriticalSection. This happens at a customer site and I have downloaded .dmp files from there to see more. To some extent it seems that the CRITICALSECTION structure is messed up, but looking at the assembly code at the point of the crash and the register contents it is still strange, eax is 0 while the memory cell it was loaded from, i.e. [esi0x10] does not contain 0. This may be a problem with the .dmp file maybe.p  pHowever, the main issue is if anyone knows of any other reasons that this can happen than a random memory write due to some program bug. I have had this crash 5 times and no other spurious crashes. This in conjunction with the fact that wxThread is a shallow object makes it seem unlikely that application code could find and destroy a particular part of the CRITICALSECTION struct.p  pIn particular it would of course be interesting to know if anyone has experienced and solved a similar provlem.p  pThe environment is VS2008sp1 and wxWidgets 2.8.11p  pHeres the very short call stack for the thread.

My question is, using strings and characters or some other way, Im kind of guessing, is there a way to represent C as String C, where C1, D2, E3,..etc. so that when the program inputs for a major chord, it requests the 1st, 3rd and fifth of the respective scale  So basically the user picks the chord C Maj, which converts to 1, 3, 5, and then the scales are matched up and the program calls those 3 specific intervals of that scale.p  pAny help would be appreciated, or a different way to think about this entirely.p  pUsing what little knowledge Ive had, I used a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavajavaOOenum.html relnofollowOraclesa website and found their example of enumeration and put this together p  precodepublic enum Chord  CHORD, MAJOR, MINOR, DIMINISHED, BASS, BASS2 codepre  pp  precodepublic enum Scales  C, D, E, F, G, A codepre  pp  precodepublic class EnumTest  Chord chord  public EnumTestChord chord      this.chord  chord   public void tellItLikeItIs      switch chord          case MAJOR System.out.printlnC, E, G                      break          case MINOR System.out.printlnC, Eb, G                      break            default     System.out.printlnI screwed up                      break        public static void mainString[] args      EnumTest firstDay  new EnumTestChord.MAJOR     firstDay.tellItLikeItIs     EnumTest thirdDay  new EnumTestChord.MINOR     thirdDay.tellItLikeItIs    codepre  pp  pI still dont understand, using Olivers example, how to specify when I make a C major chord that I want the 1st, 3rd, and 5th value of the Scales enum. I like the idea about using the semitones from C and building off each chord, but I couldnt figure out how to put the s into the Scales class illegal character.. So basically my question is how do I get the Chord class to get the scale degrees from the Scales class and plug it into the EnumTest classp  pIf there is somewhere else I can go and ask dumb questions without bugging people I can try asking there pp

My questions arep  ol liphow can I make it so the first index is file, and second index are columns I assigned in the variable codelabelscode So that I can writep  pcodetest[myfile1][col1]codepli ol  pright now, codetest[myfile1]code only gives me a series of records.p  ol lipalso, how can I then reindex things so that the first indices are the column labels of each file and the second is the filename So that I can writep  pcodetest[col1][myfile1]codepli ol  por codeprint test[col1]code and then see the value of codecol1code shown for codemyfile1, myfile2code, etc.p

Negative 1211 pWe are passing the url page to our Admin Emails through the refer id in Joomla using ...p  precodewindow.addEventdomready, function      document.getElementByIdrefer.valuewindow.location.href   codepre  pThis code works on some sites but not others. I have tried a jquery version with little luck, though I am open for suggestions. A site not returning the url via email is at a hrefhttpwww.freestylelitemeter.com relnofollowhttpwww.freestylelitemeter.coma while a site that is working is at a hrefhttpwww.comparediabetictestingsupplies.com relnofollowhttpwww.comparediabetictestingsupplies.coma. We are using refer as a hidden field and everything matches, so I believe the issues is with the window.addEventdomready, function unless there is a conflict I am not aware of. Another interesting thing is the working domain has many more script files that has in the past found conflict between script files, while the smaller site has not.p

Negative 1211 pIm creating a emData Access Layerem DAL to readmodify some tables stored in an XML file. While my application is running, the rows of these tables are updated very often, therefore I thinking about two possible alternativesp  ol liWhen the application starts, I could load all the data in tables through the DAL and put them in a data structure such as a codeDictionarycode. While the application is running, this dictionary is continuously updated. When the application is closing, I invoke a method of the DAL in order to overwrite the old file with the new data in the dictionary.li liIt would probably be more correct to hide this dictionary to the upper layers, so I might have a codeDictionarycode private field in the DAL. In this way, the upper layers would call the methods of the DAL to update the rows of the tables.li ol  pIs perhaps the second approach better than the first onep

Negative 1211 pCurrently, I have a fixed timestep game loop running on a second thread in my game. The OpenGL context is on the same thread, and rendering is done once per frame after any updates. So the main loop has to wait for drawing each frame before it can proceed. This wasnt really a problem until I wrote my particle system. Upwards of 1500 particles with a physics step of 16ms causes the framerate to drop just below 30, anymore and its worse. The particle rendering cant be optimized anymore without losing capability, so I decided to try moving OpenGL to a 3rd thread. I know this is somewhat of an extreme case, but I feel it should be able to handle it.p  pIve thought of running 2 loops concurrently, one for the main stepping fixed timestep and one for drawing however fast it can go. However the rendering calls pass in data that may be changed each update, so I was concerned that locking would slow it down and negate benefit. However, after implenting a test to do this, Im just getting EXCBADACCESS after less than a second of runtime. I assume because theyre trying to access the same data at the same time I thought the system automatically handled thisp  pWhen I was first learning OpenGL on the iPhone, I had OpenGL setup on the main thread, and would call performSelectorOnMainThreadwithObjectwaitUntilDone with the rendering selector, and these errors would happen any time waitUntilDone was false. If it was true, it would happen randomly sometimes, but sometimes I could let it run for 30 mins and it would be fine. Same concept as whats happening now I assume. I am getting the first frame drawn to the screen before it crashes though, so I know something is working.p  pHow would this be properly handled, and if so would it even provide the speed up Im looking for Or would multiple access slow it down just as muchp

Negative 1211 pIve been working on a C project, which emrequiresem completely dynamically allocated functions, which means mallocnew and mprotect and then modify the buffer manually to assembly code.

For examplep  precodeint ImAcDeclFuncint a, int b       return a  b  codepre  pIf I would like to literally create a duplicate of this function, but completely dynamically, what would that require and remember its C with eminlineem assembly For starters, I guess I would have to do something like this or a similiar solutionp  precode My main.... byte  ImAcDeclFunc  new byte[memory] mprotectAlignImAcDeclFunc, pageSize, PROTEXEC  PROTREAD  PROTWRITE codepre  pAfter this I would have to find out the assembly code for the codeImAcDeclFuncint a, int bcode.

And Im not interested in using boostfunction or something similiar, I emneedem the function to be completely dynamic, therefore my interest p  pNOTE This question is a continuation on my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10451635candfullydynamicfunctions10451918previous onea, but with far more specifics.p

Negative 1211 pI read in some good C tutorial that independent references do exist, and act like aliasing. But... I wonder what it is made for. Why should one want to use aliasing. p  pBesides, some piece of code that is not clear to mep  precodeint a int ampref  a  independent reference int b  19 ref  b   cout ltlt a ltlt   ltlt ref ltlt n ref   cout ltlt a ltlt   ltlt ref ltlt n codepre  pFirst, ref is a reference to a. I understand from second line of code that address for ref hence the ampershead is a. Then, integer ref is assigned the value of b 19. First cout returns a and ref, both equal to 19. Why Isnt integer a the address for ref Then, decrements ref, and last cout gives two times 18. a and ref where decremented. p  pOnly strange possible interpretation of mystery here intamp is a type in itself, independent reference to an integer, and this type means aliasing. Then whatever you do to ref, the same is done to a. p  pIs that right But why should one need aliasingp

Negative 1211 pIm a newbie rails and web developer. I have some experience with iOS.p  pIm creating a web application for the first time. However, these days all web application must be supported by iphone, Android and other clients. After spending 23 months understanding rails and then HTML, Javascript, JQuery and writing code. Im getting the realization that there is latency in rendering HTML and web pages.p  pSo I was thinking if I want to make a web application, I want to make it modular by design. What I mean is I want to only render JSON in every method and let the clients figure out how to render and design the views. Keeping this in mind, I searched the web for solutions and saw people talking about creating an API.p  pI read up a bit about it. But my knowldege still has holes. So I would like to know how can I design a server side of a web app that can be used by different clients iOS, Android and browsers. Is there a certain design philosophy Dos Donts Any caveats What are the technologies involved in this p  pThere seems to be a lot of scattered info on the web, but is there 1 place where I can learn about everything or most things I need to know to get this app runningp  pI would really appreciate your help.p  pThanksp
Negative 1211 pThis is probably a simple question but I am stumped and just dont know where to start.p  pI have a PHP script imagefeed.php that returns a URL to an image. Every time this URl is called it returns the latest image available the image changes every couple of seconds. p  pWhat I want to happen is that when the page loads, there is an AJAX call to imagefeed.php, which returns the latest url. This URl is then inserted into the HTMl replacing the appropriate image src.p  pAfter 5 seconds, I want the process to repeat, and for the image to update. However, I dont want the image to be swapped until it has finished loading, and I want to avoid a white space appearing before the new image loads.p  pAt the moment I have the following jQuery, which simply loads the return value of imagefeed.php directly into a div called image1. imagefeed.php is correctly formatted to provide a html image tag.p  precode    document.readyfunction     var container  image1     container.loadimagefeed.phpCAMERAURIltcameraurigt     var refreshId  setIntervalfunction              container.loadimagefeed.phpCAMERAURIltcameraurigt     , 5000    codepre  pThis works, but there is a problem. I get a white space the size of the image in IE and Firefox every time the image refreshes, because the image takes a while to download.p  pI know what I need to is for imagefeed.php to return the plain URL to the image. I then use some jQuery to request this URL, preload it and then swap it with the existing image. p  pHowever, Im still struggling to get anywhere. Could someone be so kind as to give me some pointers  helpp

Looking into this I found that I have to add some additional script files to generate the log files as covered a hrefhttpdev.sencha.comdeployext4.1.0gplreleasenotes.htmlhereap  blockquote   pLayout Failuresp      pAs result of the design for the layout engine in 4.1, it is possible   for improper configuration or a bug to cause a layout run to fail to   complete all of its calculations. When this occurs, the layout simply   stops and the partial results that have been flushed to the DOM are   all that is visible. In some cases, the layout may be 99 complete and   the failure may go undetected or appear as a minor visual anomaly. In   other cases, the layout may fail early and leave the UI in a clearly   broken state much like a JS error during layout would do in previous   versions.p      pDiagnosticsp      pThe first step if you suspect you are seeing a layout failure is to   enable the layout diagnostics.

Negative 1211 pSo, a quick background.  I make productivity apps specifically CRM and Project Management.  And I love the docs, spreadsheet and presentation products made by Google.  Not surprisingly, my products have done a lot of things with Google Docs for a long timep  ul liCreate native ie. DocsSpreadsheetsPresentations documentsli liUse native documents as templatesli liLink and modify permissions of any file in DocsDriveli liUpload any arbitrary fileli lietc.li ul  pWhat Im confused about is what does Google want me to do on the labels on the buttons in my app.  Right now, they all say Google Docs.  Youre linking any arbitrary file to a presentation, youre linking it from Google Docs.  Youre exporting a spreadsheet of time sheet entries, youre exporting it to Google Docs.  You upload a PDF, you uploaded it to Google Docs. Etc.p  pWhat Im confused about is that, and correct me if Im wrong, but I dont think it is a complete switch over to Drive.  I still see labels on the Google site for Google Docs.  So, this is what I think the breakdown isp  pIf it is a Google native file, then it is Docs, else it is Drive.  Thus, if your uploading any arbitrary file, that button should refer to drive.  But if you are exporting a spreadsheet of data to the Google Spreadsheets format, then that is Docs.p  pIs this right at all  Does Google have some information somewherep

Negative 1211 pWe have an app we are designing using iOS 5 storyboards Xcode 4.4, Mountain Lion with a tab view controller and were trying to add a split view controller as a third tab.  p  pPrior to adding the Split View Controller, we set all the view controllers to landscape orientation in the simulated metrics section of the storyboard editor.  Worked fine.  Added the Split View Controller, changed its orientation to landscape, and the first tab not the split view now draws all the UI elements as if its portrait when we run it in the simulator.  The simulator defaults to landscape, but the UI is sideways as if it was portrait, with most of it hidden because its designed to be landscape.p  pWe deleted the Split View Controller and the problem persists.p  pAny ideas  Weve cleaned, rebuilt, quit Xcode, rerun, etc.  There has not been one stitch of code added yet, as we are simply trying to build the UI appearance before writing code to back it up, and were at the very early stages.p  pThanks.p  pAndrewp
Negative 1211 pAs far as I can tell only objects that have been loaded into the DOM can be manipulated with selectors. This is illustrated in the example below, when the button is clicked its click handler unsuccessfully tries to select an element in the page to be loaded and change its html before.

Negative 1211 pI wrote a little test application for learning how to work with multiple languages and I used the emulator to test it. I am using NetBeans with the Android SDK. The multilanguage aspect of the app is working fine. Because of the slowness of using the emulator, I tried to run my app on my device HTC Inspire 4G. Ive done before with other applications and had no problem. However, today, with this simple app, when I switch back and forth between the first and second screens, the buttons and textview on page 2 keep shrinking. This does not happen in the emulator the widgets stay the same size. Im not doing anything layoutwise that I havent done in the past so I have no clue as to why the buttons are going whacko. Relevant code is posted below.  I hope another pair of eyes might find what Im missing.p  pThanks times a million, Billp  pUPDATE  I noticed if I rotate my phone, from portrait to landscape or vice versa after the buttons have shrunk, they revert to normal default size.

Negative 1211 pIs there a way to set a breakpoint at every line in the code with GDB Obviously I dont want to hit codeb addrcode for every single line, so Im wondering if theres a fast way to do this.p  pstrongEditstrong Note that I am running a binary created by someone else and I do not have access to the source code. Unfortunately, that binary has not been compiled with the g flag. Therefore, I cannot just single step through each line in the code.p  pstrongFurther Editstrong As Jason points out below, you can indeed single step through the code so long as you use codesicode or codenicode, as opposed to just simply codescode step or codencode next. codencode or codescode work fine, though, if the source code had been compiled with g, but it steps through lines of source code, as opposed to stepping through every assembly instruction like codenicode or codesicode do in a binary that was compiled without g.p

Negative 1211 pMy SQL sense isnt working this morning and I need some help.p  pI have 3 primary tables, with two intermediate tables between them used for manytomany relationships codeusercode, codeusersgroupscode, codegroupcode, codegroupspermissionscode, and codepermissioncode. Each codepermissioncode has a codenamecode.p  pI would like to write a query that, given a permission name and a user id, returns the corresponding permission id emif the permission existsem, and also returns a value if the user has the permission else NULL. That is to say, I want to know both if the permission exists and if the user has the permission in one query. The output should look something like thisp  precode                         haspermission  doesnothavepermission  permissionexists             1,1             1,NULL permissiondoesnotexist      NA              [0 rows] codepre  pRight now, the query I can think of looks something like thisp  precodeSELECT p.id, ug.userid FROM permission AS p LEFT JOIN      groupspermissions AS gp ON p.id  gp.permissionid LEFT JOIN      group AS g ON gp.groupid  g.id LEFT JOIN      usersgroups AS ug ON ug.groupid  g.id AND ug.userid   WHERE p.name   codepre  pThe problem is that this returns more than one row in certain cases. I could throw an codeORDER BY u.id DESCcode and a codeLIMIT 1code onto it, I think, but will that optimize well What are the indexes I need for that Is there another way that I could write this query to get the info I am looking for quickly and easilyp  pedit for those who are curious, I am using PostgreSQL, though Id like the query to be db agnostic if possible.p

Negative 1211 pOur application is made in good  ol classic ASP. Not ideal but it works and its pretty stable  has been for 1015 years. It is not particularly well documented in places, such as where a translation clientcontrolled piece of text appears. All we have against a translation is a clientid and translationid, neither of which are particularly helpful. Ive tried searching the 10s of thousands of lines of core code for codegettrans1code translation 1 and can see that doing this for another 3100 is going to be a nightmare, not to mention inaccurate as there are many functions which are called with a transid passed into them, and then they call codegettranstransidcode.p  pMy last thought on this matter is the possibility that we could maybe detect, from codegettranscode, where a function is called from  not just the line number but the file name of the include thankfully the includes are named usefully so figuring out where a translation is used should not be too hard. I highly doubt that it would be possible to get the include name on the basis that includes are processed before ASP, but Ill settle for the overall filename and then we can combine the includes to get to the line of code and log the include file name.p  pI very much doubt this is possible and cant find anything on SO or Google. Does anyone know of any way to achieve this, or have any pointers on what I might try Thanks in advance.p  pRegards, Richardp

Is there a way to have a user share the YouTube link directly from my page, rather than just a link to my sitep  pI already realize the fallback is to create a URL on my site that takes a video id parameter and redirects to the proper youtube page. p

Negative 1211 pI have an codeMVC4code web application that uses codeLinqToTwittercode to display Tweets when a users profile page is visited, if they have a Twitter handle.p  pFor this I use ApplicationOnlyAuthorizerp  precodevar auth  new ApplicationOnlyAuthorizer    Credentials  new InMemoryCredentials        ConsumerKey  twitterConsumerKey,     ConsumerSecret  twitterConsumerSecret     auth.Authorize codepre  pMy problem is that I have found that codeauth.IsAuthorizedcode always returns false, even when I have call codeAuthorizecode and am successfully able to make calls to Twitter. And also, I have found that if I call codeAuthorizecode in every call made to Twitter, that an unhandled exception is thrown if I repeat the call enough times.p  pIt seems quite important that I am able to know if auth is authorized before I make the call to Twitter. For now, I have put in a quick fix where I store my own codeIsAuthorized Sessioncode variable  but am not sure how reliable this is, because the codeSessioncode variable could outlive the actual authentication itself p  pAny advice on this would be appreciated.p

So far so good.p  pTo prevent hotlinking, on the initial GET the AdminController verifies it received a valid adminuser when it is called. This works fine the first Time, because the loginController added the object to the session.p  pNow here comes my problem Once the admin has logged in and tries to reaccess the adminpage eg via a link in the JSP the userobject seems to have vanished from the session, for I get a HttpSessionRequiredException for the loggedInUser attribute. AFAIK the object should not be removed from the session unless I call setComplete on the session. I am not calling this method So why is the attribute removed from the session I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9416707springmvcsessionattributesnotbindingproperlyherea that you cannot pass session attribues between controllers. But then a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4016532springmvcsessionattributessharedamongcontrollersherea it is said that it is possible.

Negative 1211 pI have a question about how customizable the new codeasynccodecodeawaitcode keywords and the codeTaskcode class in C 4.5 are.p  pFirst some background for understanding my problem I am developing on a framework with the following designp  ul liOne thread has a list of current things to do usually around 100 to 200 items which are stored as an own data structure and hold as a list. It has an codeUpdatecode function that enumerates the list and look whether some things need to execute and does so. Basically its like a big thread sheduler. To simplify things, lets assume the things to do are functions that return the boolean codetruecode when they are finished and should not be called next Update and codefalsecode when the sheduler should call them again next update.li liAll the things must not run concurrently and also must run in this one thread because of thread static variablesli liThere are other threads which do other stuff. They are structured in the same way Big loop that iterates a couple of hundret things to do in a big codeUpdatecode  function.li liThreads can send each other messages, including remote procedure calls. For these remote calls, the RPC system is returning some kind of future object to the result value. In the other thread, a new thing to do is inserted.li liA common thing to do are just sequences of RPCs chained together. At the moment, the syntax for this chaining is very verbose and complicated, since you manually have to check for the completion state of previous RPCs and invoke the next ones etc..li ul  pAn examplep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeFuture f1, f2 bool SomeThingToDo  returns true when finished      if f1  null         f1  Remote1.CallF1     else if f1.IsComplete ampamp f2  null         f2  Remote2.CallF2     else if f2  null ampamp f2.IsComplete         return true     return false  codepre  pNow this all sound awefull like codeasynccode and codeawaitcode of C 5.0 can help me here. I havent 100 fully understand what it does under the hood any good references, but as I get it from some few talks Ive watched, it exactly does what I want with this nicely simple codep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeasync Task SomeThingToDo  returning task is completed when this is finished.      await Remote1.CallF1     await Remote2.CallF2  codepre  pBut I cant find a way how write my codeUpdatecode function to make something like this happen. codeasynccode and codeawaitcode seem to want to use the codeTaskcode  class which in turn seems to need real threadsp  pMy closest solution so farp  pThe first thread which is running codeSomeThingToDocode calls their functions only once and stores the returned task and tests on every codeUpdatecode whether the task is completed.p  pcodeRemote1.CallF1code returns a new Task with an empty Action as constructor parameter and remembers the returned task. When F1 is actually finished, it calls codeRunSynchronouslycode on the task to mark it as completed. p  pThat seems to me like a pervertion of the task system. And beside, it creates shared memory the Tasks codeIsCompletecode boolean between the two threads which I would like to have replaced with our remote messanging system, if possible.p  pFinally, it does not solve my problem as it does not work with the awaitlike codeSomeThingToDocode implementation above. It seems the autogenerated Task objects returned by an async function are completed immediatelyp  pSo finally my questionsp  ol liCan I hook into asyncawait to use my own implementations instead of codeTaskltTgtcodeli liIf thats not possible, can I use codeTaskcode without anything that relates to blocking and threadsli liAny good reference what exactly happens when I write codeasynccode and codeawaitcodeli ol

Negative 1211 pI am converting my application from Syncronous to Asyncronous HTTP requests and have ran into a problem that looks like it will require quite a big reworking of how the application handles its data.  Let me try to explainp  pPreviously it was like thisp  pcodeClass1code, codeClass2code and codeClass3code were all subclasses of codeUIViewControllercode  Helper class  Content display classp  pThey do broadly different things but the common trait is their interaction with the helper class.  They gather details of a request in a number of different ways from a user and then eventually send a request to the helper class.br When it was done syncronously the helper class would return the data.  Each class would then interpret the data XML files and pass them on to the Content display class via a seguep  pstrongSo something broadly like thisstrongp  pClass1p  precodeGet user input SomeData data  [helperclass makerequest] id vcData  [data process] [self performSegueWithIdentifiersegueIdentifier]   voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue      DestinationViewController destination  DestinationViewController segue.destinationViewController     destination.data  vcData  codepre  pContent display classp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     [self.data presentdata]  codepre  pstrongNow it looks like thisstrongp  pI dealt with this problem by first making it work with Class1 with a view to deploying the fix to class2 and class3.  So class1 and helper now interact like thisp  pClass1p  precodeGet user input SomeData data  [helperclass makerequestWithSenderself] id vcData  [data process] [self performSegueWithIdentifiersegueIdentifier]   voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue      DestinationViewController destination  DestinationViewController segue.destinationViewController     destination.data  vcData   codepre  pNow the biggest problem I am facing is how to get the data from helperclass back to codeClass1code.  I managed to get it to work by doingp  precodevoidmakeRequestWithSenderClass1sender    [NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest...               [sender sendDatadata]        codepre  pHowever, when I have came to roll this out to the other 2 GUI classed which will compose the request I am having difficulty with.  My first thought was to set codesenderidcode but that fails at the line code[sender sendDatadata]code telling me that codeidcode does not have an method codesendDatacode or similar.p  pHopefully I wasnt too vague here and you guys can help.  If required I will be able to post code snippets but for now can anyone help with a better suggestion about how to structure the code for this requestp

Negative 1211 pIm working on a system with a thread pool that will submit chained tasks. Each task will run, check its result, and then execute another task based on the outcome. This is done within the same thread, so it is not resubmitting jobs back to the thread pool. Each task will add its result to an object that wraps a Collection and offers a few other minor functions, then pass that into the next task in the chain. Once the end of the chain is reached, the result is returned in a Future.get with a timeout and the full results can be analyzed.p  pEach task will be calling to an external service, ie, a SOAP request. If a task hangs, its likely waiting and waiting for a response. In that case, if the get times out, I catch the TimeoutException and canceltrue the future. This means an InterruptedException is thrown in the task thread as its likely in a wait state and can be caught. The exception is wrapped in a response object and placed in the Collection wrapper.p  pNow, it seems that I cannot get that collection back from the Future object if it times out. Im looking at hanging on to the original task or a wrapper for tasks and, if the TimeoutException is caught and the Future cancelled, retrieving the Collection wrapper from the original task, which should contain the results up to the point of the timeout.p  pHowever, I dont know if this itself would be threadsafe or a race condition. If the main thread immediately tries to access the wrapped Collection after cancelling the Future object, will the wrapped exception be in there Would it wind up in attempts at concurrent iteration and modification Is there a way to ensure that the wrapped exception makes it into that collection before the main thread retrieves itp  pSome QampD sample codep  precodepublic class MyCallable implements CallableltMyResponseCollectiongt       private MyResponseCollection responses  new MyResponseCollection  Wraps a List     private MyTask task This is set prior to submitting the task wrapper      public MyResponseCollection call throws Exception          task.setCollectionresponses         task.call kicks off the task chain, not an override to Callable.call         return responses If all goes well, this is passed into the Future        public class MyTask       private MyResponseCollection responses      public void setCollectionMyResponseCollection responses         this.responses  responses           public void call         try             MyResponse m  this.doStuff             responses.addm             this.executeNextm Runs the next task based on the response, simplified here, responses object passed into the next task           catch InterruptedException e             responses.addnew ExceptionResponsee Heres where we catch that potential interrupt                     public MyResponse doStuff throws InterruptedException          All work done here        codepre  pThis is my first significant foray into multithreading, so Im not quite certain how to ensure the order of operations between threads and the like or if Im doing something silly here and theres a better solution.

Negative 1211 pIm working on a project where we plan to send some data back to Desire2Learn. Ive gotten pretty far, I can query the user list, I can get their profile id, get their profile, and then update said profile.p  pI noticed when looking through the documentation, that I if I call  coded2lapilp1.3usersOrgDefinedId123456789code it returns just that one user as seen below.p  precode[              OrgId ORGID,         UserId 12345,         FirstName Christopher,         MiddleName null,         LastName Sterling,         UserName csterli1,         ExternalEmail MYEMAIL,         OrgDefinedId 123456789,         UniqueIdentifier UID,         Activation              IsActive true         ,         DisplayName Chris Sterling      ] codepre  pThe problem, I believe, that Ive ran into is that in order for me to get the Profile ID, I cant call the url above, but instead, I have to call coded2lapilp1.3enrollmentsorgUnitsORGIDuserscode. That call there returns the Profile ID, but it also returns all users, in increments of 100.p  pWhat I am wondering is if there is a way that I can pass the OrgDefinedId to the enrollments method and have it return the user objectp  pIf that isnt the case, Im wondering, is there a better way to do what I am trying to do.

Negative 1211 pI made a simple program in c for connecting to a site and loading a page HTML code or send data using GETPOST requests. But now I want the program to connect and sendreceive data through proxy. You probably know software like NextVpn and proxifier. when they are running any application which tries to communicate through internet will have to go through these apps. The problem is that my program connects and communicates directly and my proxy software doesnt interfere. Communication is done by the socket programming routins SOCKET class like thisp  precodeSOCKET scksocketAFINET,SOCKSTREAM,IPPROTOTCP connectsck,SOCKADDRampSockAddr,sizeofSockAddr sendsck,myRequest,strlenmyRequest,0 codepre  pAny solutionp  pEDIT The problem was from NextVPN not the Proxifier itself. It seems that NextVPN lacks functionality in hooking into some programs. First NextVPN finds the program which is trying to connect to a remote address then redirects it to its portable version of proxifier with something named compose.ns . Unfortunately it was unable or couldnt detect my app connecting to internet. Instead I used Proxifier itself and it successfully detected my app as it was showing in its connection list.p

Negative 1211 pIs there a way to attach to an already running JVMp  pFor example, in JNI you can use codeJNICreateJavaVMcode to create a VM and run a jar and inspect all its classes..p  pHowever, if the jar is already running, I cannot find a way to attach to its JVM and communicate with its classes or get its codeenvcode pointer..p  pAnother problem is that if the jar loads my native library .dll and I want to create a JVM inside the .dll, I cannot.. Nor can I attach the jars current JVM either without the jar calling my function..p  pExample on the Java sidep  precodeclass Foo      static loadLibraryFoo  codepre  pon the C sidep  precodevoid Foo      CreateJVM     Attach to the current process..     Call function from the jar that loaded me.  codepre  pThis cannot be done without the jar calling codeFoocode first.p  pAny ideas Is there no way to get the current JVM or to attach to it or an external jvm instancep

Negative 1211 pI have an Azure Cloud Service project going, which consists of a Web Role and a Worker role. The Web Role is an MVC 5 app, the authentication setup on it is what is included with a standard MVC 5 project. On my worker role, Im selfhosting a SignalR app. So far its working fine, I can call the hub on my worker role from my web role, and vice versa. The problem, however, is that Context.User in the worker role SignalR hub is null, even though Im  signed in on my web role.p  pI realize the problem is that authentication isnt properly wired up on my worker role, but Im not sure how to go about that.

Negative 1211 pI am trying to implement merge sort but my code seems to be missing something.

I have been scratching my head trying to figure it out and have come to the conclusion that it must be because of the session since normal calls work just fine.  p  pHere is my PHP codep  precodeltphp  sessionstart linkmysqliconnectredacted, redacted, ,  if link      dieCould not connect  . mysqlierrorlink  max  countSESSION[cart] json  array for i0 iltmaxi      pid  SESSION[cart][i][productid]     result  mysqliquerylink,SELECT  FROM atable WHERE PIDpid     ifmysqlinumrowsresult         whilerowmysqlifetchassocresult             json[]row                mysqlicloselink echo jsonencodejson gt codepre  pHere is my objectivec p  precodeNSString str[NSString stringWithFormattheURL] NSURL url[NSURL URLWithStringstr] NSMutableURLRequest request  [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURLurl] [NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequestrequest                                    queue[NSOperationQueue mainQueue]                        completionHandlerNSURLResponse response,                                            NSData data, NSError connectionError        if data.length gt 0 ampamp connectionError  nil                NSArray theResponses  [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithDatadata                                                         options0                                                           errorNULL]          NSLogresponse , theResponses        ] codepre  pOn a side note I have tested my php script response in postman so I know it works just fine.

Negative 1211 pIm having troubles understanding how can I execute code when doing fast app switching i.e. pressing the WindowsStart button to show Start screen on the Phone emulator, and then pressing the Back button to go back into the app.p  pTo simplify the issue, I started a new Windows Universal App that uses the Visual C Hub App Universal Apps template as base code since it includes the SuspensionManager and the NavigationHelper. Since Im not interested in the Hub itself, I removed all the Grid content from the HubPage.xaml and simply added a TextBox called TimeTextBoxp  precode...     ltGrid xNameLayoutRootgt         ltTextBox NameTimeTextBoxgt     ltGridgt ltPagegt codepre  pThen, in the HubPage.xaml.cs, I added the following simple line to the method NavigationHelperLoadStatep  precodeprivate async void NavigationHelperLoadStateobject sender, LoadStateEventArgs e      var sampleDataGroups  await SampleDataSource.GetGroupsAsync     this.DefaultViewModel[Groups]  sampleDataGroups      TimeTextBox.Text  DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.ToString  codepre  pIf I execute the app on the Phone emulator after applying those simple changes, the app will show the time of the day when loading the page, for example 160853.4390827.p  pWhat I want is that time to be updated every time I navigate to that page. But I if use the Lifecycle Events from Visual Studio to simulate a Suspend, when I send the Resume event the time is still the same 160853.4390827, and a breakpoint in that line will confirm that the NavigationHelperLoadState method doesnt get executed when resuming.p  pThe explanation for this is that the App.xaml.cs, as it is in the template, doesnt provide any listener for the Resume event, so nothing gets executed. Adding the next few lines fixes that  p  precode    public App              this.InitializeComponent         this.Suspending  this.OnSuspending          this.Resuming  AppResuming           async void AppResumingobject sender, object e              await SuspensionManager.RestoreAsync      codepre  pSo if I run again the app on the Phone emulator, now I get the actual time after resuming. Great The problem is that these SuspendResume events dont get triggered when I simply tap on the Windows button of the Phone and then tap on the back button.p  pActually, I havent been able to identify one single method that gets executed when performing that kind of fast app switch. And thats the scenario Im actually interested for my Universal App.p  pIs there a way of catching when the navigation brings us back into the app from the Start screen through the Back button Am I missing any code to handle this scenariop  pThanksp

Negative 1211 pI am working with a crystal report that has the first few pages populated with a few fields from the database and the rest of the report has sections of static information mostly legal terms and conditions. p  pNow the report runs fine but I am running into a lot of issues when I have to update the terms and conditions text every time theres a change. It may sound easy, but Crystal is extremely finicky when it comes to handling formatting copied over from a Word Document. This makes it extremely difficult to work with. p  pI am exhausted of ideas trying to make this work, but is there any way to keep that static text independent from the report Is there anyway to give control of the document to the users so they can change it at will and be stored on the network somewhere that gets called in and embedded onto the report p  pIt neednt be just a crystal report, it can be a SSRS report as well, it really doesnt matter.p  pTLDR Need help embedding contents of a document file in a CrystalSSRS report that can be sitting out on the network somewhere.p  pThanks for the help in advance p

We dont know how or why those characters are in there and our clients arent telling. if you want to know why they arent telling, please move along, these arent the questions you are looking forp  pSo, we have many files from many clients each with many rows with many fields of data and we need to strip out bad characters.p  pI took Microsofts method and changed it a bit to be more dynamic.p  precode    private string CleanInputstring strIn, string chars               Replace invalid characters with empty strings.          try                      string regexString  string.Format[w0], chars             return Regex.ReplacestrIn, regexString, ,                                  RegexOptions.None, TimeSpan.FromSeconds1.5                   If we timeout when replacing invalid characters,            we should return Empty.          catch RegexMatchTimeoutException                      return string.Empty          codepre  pgoal here is to be able to strip out any characters that dont belong dynamically But we cant just hard code those characters because not all fields will have any of these characters, and more importantly, some fields will have some bad characters along with other characters which are not to be considered bad for that field but may be considered bad for other fields.p  pWith me so farp  pSo, in trying to get my work done by Friday yes, tomorrow, I decided to start slowly with only a couple of known bad characters from 3 input files. So far, those characters are single quote, dash, double quote, dollar sign, comma. But not all the fields in my 3 files need these characters stripped, so I intend to call the CleanInput method only on those fields that need it, and only for the characters that we need stripped.p  pOK, so while I was testing, I discovered on one field, where we want to strip the comma, single quote, double quote and dollar sign, it was not removing the double quotes an apparently the backslashes too. So I debugged this issue by first passing in only the comma that worked. Then I tried passing in only the single quote  that worked. Then I passed in the dollar sign  that worked. Then I passed in the escaped double quote and that didnt work  the double quotes are still in the string. So I simplified my test in a new console project and I hard coded the string and I called my method just to make sure nothing else could be interfering with it.p  pI hope and pray no one spends hours of their precious time trying to reconfigure my input files or attempting to teach me the end all be all of regex programming. I have to get this done by tomorrow. Please, I only want to know how to strip the double quote and apparently the backslashes too from the given string. p

Negative 1211 pUsing SAS, I often want to perform an action on each row of a dataset. To do so, I use a command I found on a tutorial  codecall executecode. As Im not very familiar with SAS environment, I tend to use macrofunctions to do anything I dont know how to and execute them with codecall executecode. However I have difficulties understanding how macrolanguage works exactly in SAS. I know that all macro references are resolved first, which provides a baseSAS code which is then executed or am I already wrong . But I dont understand how it applies with codecall executecode. Lets consider the following code p  precodemacro prog1     prog1 defines a macrovariable mv1  global mv1 data null call symputxmv1,plop run mend  macro prog2var     prog2 puts it on the log  put PUT ampvar mend  macro progglob     progglob executes prog 1 then prog2  prog1 prog2ampmv1 mend codepre  pI know there is no need for three macros here but this is a minimal version of my real code, which has this structure.p  pNow if I execute codeprogglobcode p  precodeprogglob codepre  pI get codePUT plopcode on the log, as expected. But if I use it with codecall executecode even if there is no need for loop here p  precodedata null macNRSTRprogglob call executemac run codepre  pI get only codePUTcode. There is no error suggesting that the macrovariable is not defined so the codeglobalcode statement worked. But somehow, codeprog2code was executed before codeprog1code base part at least I think so and codemv1code is not defined yet.p  pMy questions are p  ul liIs my interpretation correct li liWhy does the result change when I use codecall executecode li liDepending on the precedent question answer, how should I fix it or is there a more convenient way to loop trough a column values li ul  pstrongEDIT strong My original code intends to rename the variables of several tables, which I have listed in a dataset. For each listed table, I want the following algorithm executed p  ul liprog1  store a list with all variables in a macrovariable this is where I define codemvcode equivalentli liprog2  add a common suffix to these variables namesli ul  pThere is probably a more clever way to do this. Again, Im not so familiar with SAS and I tend to overuse macros. If you want to show me a better way to do this, Id be happy to chat but I dont expect you guys to rewrite all my code so an alternative to codecall executecode would be enough for me to be grateful  p

Negative 1211 pIn my experience with Racket so far, Ive not given much thought to vectors, because I gathered that their main benefit constanttime access to elements was not significant until youre working with lot of elements.p  pThis doesnt seem quite accurate, however. Even with a small number of elements, vectors have a performance advantage. For example, allocating a list is slower than allocating a vectorp  precodelang racket  time for [i inrange 1000000] makelist 50 t time for [i inrange 1000000] makevector 50 t  gtcpu time 1337 real time 1346 gc time 987 gtcpu time 123 real time 124 gc time 39 codepre  pAnd retrieving an element is slower toop  precodelang racket  define l range 50 define v makevector 50 0  time for [i inrange 1000000] listref l 49 time for [i inrange 1000000] vectorref v 49  gtcpu time 77 real time 76 gc time 0 gtcpu time 15 real time 15 gc time 0 codepre  pBTW this performance ratio holds if we increase to 10 millionp  precodelang racket  define l range 50 define v makevector 50 0  time for [i inrange 10000000] listref l 49 time for [i inrange 10000000] vectorref v 49  gtcpu time 710 real time 709 gc time 0 gtcpu time 116 real time 116 gc time 0 codepre  pSure, these are synthetic examples, to the extent that most programs dont allocate structures or use codelistrefcode a million times in a loop. And yes, Im deliberately grabbing the 50th element to illustrate the performance difference.p  pBut theyre also not, because across a whole program that relies on lists, youre going to be incurring a little extra overhead every time you touch those lists, and all those little inefficiencies will add up into slower running time for the overall program.p  pThus my question why not just use vectors all the time In what situations should we expect better performance from lists p  pMy best guess is that because its just as fast to get an item off the strongfrontstrong of a list, e.g.p  precodelang racket  define l range 50 define v makevector 50 0  time for [i inrange 1000000] listref l 0 time for [i inrange 1000000] vectorref v 0  gtcpu time 15 real time 16 gc time 0 gtcpu time 12 real time 11 gc time 0 codepre  p... that lists are preferred in recursion siutations, because youre mostly working with codeconscode and codecarcode and codecdrcode, and it saves space to work with a list vectors cannot be broken and put back together without copying the whole vector, rightp  pBut in situations where youre storing and retrieving data elements, it seems that vectors have the advantage, no matter the length.p
Negative 1211 pWhen attempting to log in my android application uses HttpClient to make a post request a couple hundred bytes in size to a PHP script on a site hosted by GoDaddy. The script does an SQL query on a table that currently has only one row. Ive been testing it on my Samsung Galaxy S4. On Wifi, sometimes it takes a second or two, which doesnt worry me too much because it wont upset the users of my app. However, on maybe one out of every 10 tries on 4G Verizon, greater New York City area it takes over a minute, which would upset even the most patient.

Option 2 sets the header, but only temporarily. I can see it set if I log getSoapAction call in the callback, but its not sent anywhere. At least not as a separate header as I suspect is required by the service.p  pI digged a bit the sources of a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepo1.maven.orgmaven2org.springframework.wsspringwscore2.1.4.RELEASEorgspringframeworkwssoapsaajSaajSoapMessage.javaSaajSoapMessage.setSoapAction28java.lang.String29 relnofollowSaajSoapMessage implementationa and it is in fact setting the action as part of the ContentType header, which is, according to some references I read, correct behaviour. The problem is that I dont see the action in ContentType header either.p  pThe other SO questions had an answer stating that theres a bug in Saaj implementation, which causes the change of action header to be ignored. Based on the issue timestamp, Id expect it to be fixed for the version in use.p  pFor the debugging purposes Im using SoapUI mock I have created. I dont have access to the source or logs of the actual WS implementation. I believe it uses .NET  WCF if that makes any difference.p  pSo, it all boils down to simple question strongHow do I set the SOAPAction header for SOAP 1.2 with SpringWSstrongp  pIm using version 2.1.4RELEASE of SpringWS, but instead of the default dependencies to Springcore version 3.2.4 etc., Ive manually set dependencies for the same libs, but for version 3.2.7.

Negative 1211 pI understand that codeQEventShortcutOverridecode occurs when there is a shortcut registered in the parent and the child wants to go against the rule. The example given on the a hrefhttpqtproject.orgwikiShortcutOverride relnofollowQt Wikia is of a media player which pauses with Space but a codeQLineEditcode might want to use the Space, which makes a lot of sense.p  pFurthermore, if the event is accepted then a codeQEventKeyPresscode is generated to the child widget so you can treat your particular case.p  pNow, my question is, why does it seem that the default action is to actually strongacceptstrong the codeQEventShortcutOverridecode when a standard shortcut is used This seems to me like the opposite of what the name suggest, i.e., its overriden by default and you have to treat the event to let the shortcut pass.p  pIn the code below, if you dont install the event filter you dont see the message.p  precodefrom PySide.QtGui import QApplication from PySide import QtGui, QtCore  app  QApplication[]  class TestQtGui.QWidget     def initself, parentNone         superTest, self.initparent          self.setLayoutQtGui.QVBoxLayout         self.wedit  QtGui.QLineEditparentself         self.layout.addWidgetself.wedit           If we install the event filter and ignore the ShortcutOverride          then the shortcut works         self.wedit.installEventFilterself           CtrlLeft is already in use jump to previous word         shortcut  QtGui.QShortcutQtGui.QKeySequenceCtrlLeft, self         shortcut.setContextQtCore.Qt.ApplicationShortcut         shortcut.activated.connectself.testslot      def testslotself         printctrlleft pressed      def eventFilterself, obj, event         if obj is self.wedit and event.type  QtCore.QEvent.ShortcutOverride              Send the event up the hierarchy             event.ignore              Stop obj from treating the event itself             return True           Events which dont concern us get forwarded         return superTest, self.eventFilterobj, event  widget  Test widget.show  if name  main     app.exec codepre  pMy actual scenario is a tab widget for which I want to use CtrlLeftRight to cycle through the tabs, which works unless something like a codeQLineEditcode has focus.

Negative 1211 pa hrefhttpsphpexcel.codeplex.com relnofollowPHPExcela is a library to generate MS Excel file using PHP and so far the best one I have used in supporting Chinese output. It works fine in Laravel. However, unlike libraries for generating email or PDF files, in PHPExcel and many other libraries used for generating Excel file the file can only be generated by calling PHP functions instead of converting HTML into Excel, so the code has to be put in controller  classes.p  pI feel a little uncomfortable to put codes that mainly for views into controller, and it is a group project so readability is also a concern. Is there a way I can put the code generating Excel file into view in Laravelp

Negative 1211 pApologies if this is a dumb fool question, but Im tired today and google isnt helping. This must be a common problem, but nothing Ive found answers the question.p  pWhenever Ive made use of Entity Framework in clickonce desktop applications, Ive suffered a bit with the entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker error. This arises when multiple versions of the same database object are updated by different versions of the context. p  pOn a web project, its easy to bypass this issue by sending all the Db calls through some sort of singleton pattern on the server. If youre farming out a lot of Db updateinsert calls to a service, you can do the same.p  pBut what if you had a distributed application e.g. WPF via clickonce which potentially had a lot of users connecting to the database. Each user has their own install of the code, so even if you separate out the business logic from the Db logic, each user will still have their own copy of the context. p  pIs there any sort of pattern or technique that would allow insertsupdates direct from the application while avoiding the multiple contexts problem Or is using something like a Windows service the only way to achieve thisp

Negative 1211 pI am working on a setup with multiple databases, technology stacks spring with hibernate running on tomcat 6. Transactions across databases was not a requirement, and each database has its own dataSource, sessionFactory and transactionManager org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManager with a declarative use of transaction management Transactional annotation. Recently there have been a requirement to have a oneoff case of making insertions in two of those DBs say db1 and db2 transactional.p  pI am aware that there are third party libraries like JOTM and atomikos, which can add JTA support to tomcat. But I would like to know if its at all possible to manage transactions manually. p  pFor example, can there be something like followingp  precodeTransaction transactionDb1      sessionFactoryDb1.getCurrentSession.beginTransaction Transaction transactionDb2  sessionFactoryDb2.getCurrentSession.beginTransaction try       DAO layer call to DB1      DAO layer call to DB2      transactionDb1.commit     transactionDb2.commit  catch Exception e      transactionDb1.rollback     transactionDb2.rollback  codepre  pIt probably wouldnt be as simplistic. But is something like that possible As far as I know Programmatic transactional handling can be used. But how do I go about it combining with the declarative approach Would I still be able to use Transactional for other cases Any help would be really appreciated.p

Negative 1211 pBecause of my slightly obsessive personality, Ive been losing most of my productive time to a single little problem.p  pI recently switched from Mac OS X Tiger to Yosemite yes, its a fairly large leap.  I didnt think AppleScript had changed that much, but I encountered a problem I dont remember having in the old days.  I had the following code, but with a valid filepathp  precode    set myfilepath to  replace with string of POSIX filepath, because typing                           colons was too much work      set myfile to open for access POSIX file myfilepath with write permission codepre  pThe rest of the code had an error which I resolved fairly easily, but because the error stopped the script before the codeclose accesscode command, and of course AppleScript left the file reference open.  So when I tried to run the script again, I was informed of a syntax error  the file is already open.  This was to be expected.p  pI ran into a problem trying to close the reference  no matter what I did, I received an error message stating that the file iwasnti open.  I tried codeclose access POSIX file  filepath string again code, codeclose access file  whatever that AppleScript filepath format is called code, et cetera.  Eventually I solved the problem by restarting my computer, but thats not exactly an elegant solution.  If no other solution presents itself, then so be it however, for intellectual and practical reasons, I am not satisfied with rebooting to close access.  Does anyone have insights regarding this issuep  pI suspect Ive overlooked something glaringly obvious.p  hr  pEdit  Wait, no, my switch wasnt directly from Tiger I had an intermediate stage in Snow Leopard, but I didnt do much scripting then.

If you did this accidentally, the codeundobuttoncode will move the item back to the codetbdlistcode.p  pHere is what should happen nextp  pWhen I click on the codedonebuttoncode a second third, fourth time, it should move it back from tbdlist to codedonelistcode, but it doesnt. The codedonebuttoncode stops working. I think the codedelbuttoncode also stops working.p  pCan someone help me understand what is going on and how to fix it. I think it has something to do with scoping. The code.clickcode functions are all on one level, and the second time around we are inside the codedonebutton.clickcode function, but this makes no sense to me since the variables are declared on the top level. If the variable even exists, its methods should exist.p  pThanks in advance, Omarp  pHTMLp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeform.submitfunctionevent event.preventDefault     var delbutton  ltligtltbutton classdelbuttongtxltbuttongtltbrgtltligt     var listitem  ltdivgtltdivgt     var donebutton  ltligtltbutton classdonebuttongt  itemname.val  ltbuttongtltligt     var itemname  ltligt itemname.val  ltligt     var nameday  ltligtyournameltligtltligtdatetodayltligt     var undobutton  ltligtltbutton classundobuttongtltbuttongtltbrgtltligt     var doneitem  ltspan classaddedgtltspangt     var doneitem  ltdivgtltdivgt     listitem.appenddonebutton     listitem.appendnameday     listitem.appenddelbutton tbdlist.appendlistitem input.val     donebutton.clickfunction          doneitem.appenditemname         doneitem.appendnameday         doneitem.appendundobutton         donelist.appenddoneitem         listitem.remove          delbutton.clickfunction          listitem.remove          undobutton.clickfunction     var delbutton  ltligtltbutton classdelbuttongtxltbuttongtltbrgtltligt     var donebutton  ltligtltbutton classdonebuttongt  itemname.val  ltbuttongtltligt         nameday  ltligtyournameltligtltligtdatetodayltligt         listitem  ltdivgtltdivgt         listitem.appenddonebutton         listitem.appendnameday         listitem.appenddelbutton         tbdlist.appendlistitem          doneitem.remove                function archive      donelist .added.remove   document.readyfunction  alertits on     Jquery load test window.onload  function      if window.jQuery             jQuery is loaded           alertYeah      else           jQuery is not loaded         alertDoesnt Work       codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode.hdr  textalign center     color black     fontweight bold     background lightblue  yellow      border 2px solid black     padding 1em  main textalign center   tbdlist  textalign center fontweight bold border 1px solid black liststyletype none   donelist  textalign center fontweight bold border 1px solid black liststyletype none   tbdlist li   width25    donelist li       width25   ltspan classcodecommentgt 4 col ltspangt  tbdlist ul, donelist, ul   width760px   marginbottom20px   overflowhidden  tbdlist li, donelist li   lineheight1.5em   floatleft   displayinline    bordercolor red   button    background 3498db   backgroundimage webkitlineargradienttop, 3498db, 2980b9   backgroundimage mozlineargradienttop, 3498db, 2980b9   backgroundimage mslineargradienttop, 3498db, 2980b9   backgroundimage olineargradienttop, 3498db, 2980b9   backgroundimage lineargradientto bottom, 3498db, 2980b9   webkitborderradius 28   mozborderradius 28   borderradius 28px   fontfamily Arial   color ffffff   fontsize 12px   padding 10px 20px 10px 20px   textdecoration none codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodelthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtShopping List Applttitlegt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssmain.cssgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltheader classhdrgt lth2 classtitleidgtShopping List Applth2gt ltheadergt ltdiv idmaingt ltul idtbdlistgt ltligtItemltligt ltligtAddedbyltligt ltligtDateltligt ltligtUndoltligt ltulgt ltbrgt ltdiv classaddergt ltformgt ltinput typetext iditemname nameItem Placeholder  An Itemgt ltbrgtby username ltbrgt on todays date ltbrgt ltformgt ltdivgt ltbutton onclickarchivegtArchiveltbuttongt ltul iddonelistgt ltligtItemltligt ltligtDonebyltligt ltligtDateltligt ltligtRegetltligt  ltulgt ltdivgt ltscript srcjsjquery1.11.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsapp.jsgtltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgtcodepre div div p

Negative 1211 pSo Im trying to figure out how to change the background color of a page after a countdown timer has been activated. For example I have code below that displays a 500 timer that begins counting after selecting the Start Button. When you press Stop the timer obviously stops, and when you select reset the timer resets to 500 and pauses. I patched the javascript code together from two codes I found online Just now beginning javascript and it works however I am now trying to figure out a way to change the background color of the page based on the time of the countdown timer.p  pSo between 300 seconds and 90 seconds the color should be GREEN Between 9030 the color should change to YELLOW 30  0 the color should change to REDp  pAny feedback you guys can give me on my code and how to accomplish the task above would be greatly appreciated. Im just starting out coding so if there is a proper way of doing javascript let me know.p  pHere is the code for my Countdown timer javascriptp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodevar seconds  300 var t  function secondPassed      var minutes  Math.roundseconds  30  60     var remainingSeconds  seconds  60     if remainingSeconds lt 10          remainingSeconds  0  remainingSeconds          document.getElementByIdcountdown.innerHTML  minutes    remainingSeconds    function countdown        starts countdown     secondPassed     if seconds  0  else          seconds         t  setTimeoutcountdown, 1000        function cdpause       pauses countdown     clearTimeoutt   function cdreset       resets countdown     cdpause     secondPassed              codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodecharset UTF8          CSS Document countdown      fontsize 2em     backgroundcolor white codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodelthtmlgt  ltheadgt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefnewTicket2.0.cssgt     ltscript srcTimer.jsgt     ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbody onloadcdresetgt     ltspan idcountdown classtimergtltspangt      ltinput typebutton valueStart onclickcountdowngt     ltinput typebutton valueStop onclickcdpausegt     ltinput typebutton valueReset onclickcdresetseconds  300gt  ltbodygt  lthtmlgtcodepre div div p  pI am thinking that in order to change the background color the code should be something like thisp  precodefunction changeColor      if seconds  300          document.change.bgColor  green      else if seconds  90          document.change.bgColor  yellow      elseseconds  30          enter code here         document.change.bgColor  red       codepre  pHowever, I have not been able to figure out how to change anything without messing up the original product. The color change should be linked to the button click. So once the start button is pressed the color should change and continue to change according to the parameters above. Once the counter has reached zero it should stay red until the reset button has been pressed. Once the reset button is pressed the color goes back to green and goes to yellow, then red. So it should work in tandem with the timer I just cant seem to get it to work.p

Negative 1211 pI am designing a dimension for a data warehouse that includes several related attributes from various tables.

Negative 1211 pGood day to all I have some function which splits an input array to partitionCount partitions. Return value should be an array of arrays.

Negative 1211 pIm currently working on a PowerShell module that dynamically assigns a unique local admin password to each machine on the network based on a specific naming convention. Ive got that script working well, but obviously, if one of the computers the script is accessing isnt turned on or is disconnected from the network, I just get the Could not connect to RPC server error message. Now, if I were to push out these password changes via group policy, even if the computer wasnt connected to the network, once it did check in, the change would be implemented. I can think of a couple of ways to mimic this behavior in PowerShell, such as setting it as a scheduled task, rerunning the script only against computers that werent reached the previous run, but I was wondering if anyone knew of any best practices for carrying out this kind of operationp  pThanksp

Since D0 to D3 of LCD are not connected,      their values depend on how the pins are connected in LCD module May be grounded, may kept open etc     So again send function set command to set 2 line display mode mode and 5x7 character mode.

Negative 1211 pI have generated an smt2 file which is already successfully read parsed by Z3 4.3 via Z3 Java APIs.  Now I would like to know that how to make Z3 start to solve formulas in multiple scopes push and pop.  The smt2 file contains a list of push and pop commands. p  pI know you can use solver.push and solver.pop to do that, but the issue here is the scopes are already generated in the file and I am not using Z3 internal APIs to make these formulas and scopes. I just need to feed the entire smt2 file to Z3 and perform multiple solving only this part I need Z3 APIs.  By simply calling solver.check method seems Z3 just completely ignores all the scopes in the middle of the smt2 file, and only gives me the model for the last checksat command.  p  pSo is there a way of calling Z3 APIs Java to perform a series of solving for multiple scopes defined in an existing smt2 file p  pAny concrete examples will be very appreciated.p
Negative 1211 pI am using a ble micro and ITG3200 gyro. I have it set up and I am getting readings to the arduino serial console. I want to communicate with Blender to move objects according to the gyros data. I am stuck with this. I have seen previous attempts at this but not any updated versions that will work with my current hardwarep  phere is my arduino codep  precodeThe Wire library is used for I2C communication include ltWire.hgt  This is a list of registers in the ITG3200. Registers are parameters that determine how the sensor will behave, or they can hold data that represent the sensors current status. To learn more about the registers on the ITG3200, download and read the datasheet. char WHOAMI  0x00 char SMPLRTDIV 0x15 char DLPFFS  0x16 char GYROXOUTH  0x1D char GYROXOUTL  0x1E char GYROYOUTH  0x1F char GYROYOUTL  0x20 char GYROZOUTH  0x21 char GYROZOUTL  0x22  This is a list of settings that can be loaded into the registers. DLPF, Full Scale Register Bits FSSEL must be set to 3 for proper operation Set DLPFCFG to 3 for 1kHz Fint and 42 Hz Low Pass Filter char DLPFCFG0  1ltlt0 char DLPFCFG1  1ltlt1 char DLPFCFG2  1ltlt2 char DLPFFSSEL0  1ltlt3 char DLPFFSSEL1  1ltlt4  I2C devices each have an address. The address is defined in the datasheet for the device. The ITG3200 breakout board can have different address depending on how the jumper on top of the board is configured. By default, the jumper is connected to the VDD pin. When the jumper is connected to the VDD pin the I2C address is 0x69. char itgAddress  0x69  In the setup section of the sketch the serial port will be configured, the i2c communication will be initialized, and the itg3200 will be configured. void setup    Create a serial connection using a 9600bps baud rate.   Serial.begin9600    Initialize the I2C communication. This will set the Arduino up as the Master device.   Wire.begin    Read the WHOAMI register and print the result   char id0    id  itgReaditgAddress, 0x00     Serial.printID    Serial.printlnid, HEX    Configure the gyroscope   Set the gyroscope scale for the outputs to 2000 degrees per second   itgWriteitgAddress, DLPFFS, DLPFFSSEL0DLPFFSSEL1DLPFCFG0   Set the sample rate to 100 hz   itgWriteitgAddress, SMPLRTDIV, 9   The loop section of the sketch will read the X,Y and Z output rates from the gyroscope and output them in the Serial Terminal void loop    Create variables to hold the output rates.   int xRate, yRate, zRate   Read the x,y and z output rates from the gyroscope.   xRate  readX   yRate  readY   zRate  readZ   Print the output rates to the terminal, seperated by a TAB character.

Negative 1211 pSeems like registering bootstrap.js to my page prevents all of my server controls, e.g. codeaspLinkButtonscode and codeaspButtonscode, from triggering a postback.p  pI have the following C script in my masterpage.

Otherwise it just loads jQuery 1.7.1.p  pIf I dont include bootstrap.js, postbacks from my codeaspLinkButtonscode and codeaspButtonscode occur as normal.  Otherwise, theres just no action happening at all.  Any ideas what could be happeningp  pI dont see any console errors in the browser, and Im absolutely certain that including Bootstrap.js is somehow partially responsible for this behavior, if not entirely.

However on creating condition for updated rows, my package is getting failed based on the reason p  blockquote   p[Conditional Split [2]] Error SSIS Error Code   DTSEINDUCEDTRANSFORMFAILUREONERROR.  The Conditional Split failed   because error code 0xC020902B occurred, and the error row disposition   on Conditional Split.Outputs[Updated Rows] specifies failure on   error. An error occurred on the specified object of the specified   component.  There may be error messages posted before this with more   information about the failure.p blockquote  pI found out the error occurred because of the condition i have specified. I have too many AND and OR conditions in my conditional split.p  pIn my requirement, i will have Workorder ID and ProductID as consistent, however there will be rows like Order Quantity, Stocked Qty, Scrapped Qty getting updated in each data load. So I created the condition in conditional split as belowp  pcodesrcWorkOrderID  lkpWorkOrderID ampamp srcProductID  lkpProductID ampamp srcOrderQty  lkpOrderQty  srcStockedQty  lkpStockedQty  srcScrappedQty  lkpScrappedQtycode ..... and so on.p  pSo if my workorderid and product id is matching in my staging and live database and other columns are not matching, i need to update all the other non matching columns in the Live Database.p  pIf I specify only one not equal to condition like codesrcWorkOrderID  lkpWorkOrderID ampamp srcProductID  lkpProductID ampamp srcOrderQty  lkpOrderQtycode my package executes perfectly.p  pHowever I need multiple not equal to comparisons in my condition.p  pAny workaround for thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comLsoJs.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLsoJs.png altenter image description hereap

The app is small and only has 3 activities MainActivity, ActivityOne and ActivityTwo. The paid app does not need any limitations since it will use the full code base. The free app however requires it to have MainActivity and ActivityTwo accessible to the user and not ActivityOne. How can I do a Manifest Merge when compiling the code so that ActivityOne is not present on the free version In other words how should strongsrcfreeAndroidManifest.xmlstrong be created so that the free app does not have ActivityOnep  pBelow is the strongbuild.gradlestrong file for the appp  precodeapply plugin com.android.application  android      compileSdkVersion 21     buildToolsVersion 21.1.2      defaultConfig          applicationId com.example.calculator         minSdkVersion 21         targetSdkVersion 21         versionCode 1         versionName 1.0          buildTypes          release              minifyEnabled false             proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFileproguardandroid.txt, proguardrules.pro                   productFlavors          paid              applicationId com.example.paid             resValue string, appname, Paid Calculator             versionName 1.0full                  free              applicationId com.example.free             resValue string, appname, Free Calculator             versionName 1.0free                   sourceSets          paid              manifest.srcFile srcpaidAndroidManifest.xml                  free              manifest.srcFile srcfreeAndroidManifest.xml                 dependencies      compile fileTreedir libs, include [.jar]     compile com.android.supportcardviewv721.0.0     compile com.android.supportrecyclerviewv721.0.0     compile com.android.supportdesign22.2.0     compile com.android.supportappcompatv722.2.0  codepre  pBelow is the manifest file for the app It is located at strongsrcmainAndroidManifest.xmlstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmanifest xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     packagecom.example.calculatorgt      ltapplication         androidnamecom.example.calculator.ui.activities.AppController         androidallowBackuptrue         androidicondrawableiclauncher         androidthemestyleAppThemegt         ltactivity             androidname.ui.activities.MainActivity             androidlabelstringappnamegt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt                 ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltactivitygt         ltactivity             androidname.ui.activities.ActivityOne             androidlabelstringtitleactivityone             androidparentActivityName.ui.activities.MainActivitygt             ltmetadata                 androidnameandroid.support.PARENTACTIVITY                 androidvalue.ui.activities.MainActivity gt         ltactivitygt         ltactivity             androidname.ui.activities.ActivityTwo             androidlabelstringtitleactivitytwo             androidparentActivityName.ui.activities.MainActivitygt             ltmetadata                 androidnameandroid.support.PARENTACTIVITY                 androidvalue.ui.activities.MainActivity gt         ltactivitygt     ltapplicationgt ltmanifestgt codepre
Negative 1211 pI have set up an AWS EMR cluster with Spark 1.4. I have set up one master node and two slave nodes. Looking at the load distribution, it seems like one slave is always maxed out while the other one is not doing much. Has anyone faced similar issue What might be causing this p  pNote I am trying to run Spark MLLib for generating recommendation. So it pulls data from Elasticsearch and does recommendation computation using Spark. One slave is always maxed out on Network usage while the other seems to be using minimal resource and almost idle. The master is using 10 GB of network while each slave is using 1 GB.p

How do I do that  What template must I use  A DLL template  p  pThe writer says, Update the XAML description of the Window to add one of your CustomVisualFrameworkElement objects to the existing StackPanel.  Doing so will require you to build a custom XML namespace that maps to your .NET namespace.p  pBelow that statement in the book there is some XAML only the important stuffp  precodexmlscustomclrnamespaceRenderingWithVisuals ltcustomCustomVisualFrameworkElementgt codepre  pSo, basically Im supposed to take some C code and then turn it into a DLL and then that is accessible by XAML code.  Whats the procedure  I need some nittygritty kind of help.p  pDo I start a fresh C solution, and only have the CustomVisualFrameworkElement there  Where in Solution Explorer do I put the DLL  Why cant I just compile the C code and have XAML reference it  Where can I find the created DLL  Is it in the bin or debug folder  p
