Positive 10851 pIve been hit by some weird behaviour recently that caused me to tear my hair out a little.  I think Ive finally worked out the problem and understand the cause but would like a sanity check on my conclusions.  Ill skip the problem and just state my assertion for simplicity the back story is long and tedious.p  pAll this is occuring on both OSX and the iOS simulator Id imagine the same is true for on device, but I havent tested that.p  ul lidylib A Exports function codefoocode marked as weak. li lidylib B Exports function codefoocode strongnotstrong marked as weak. li liApplication X linked against dylib A.li ul  pThe application runs dylib A is automatically loaded and calls codefoocode.  codeAfoocode excuse the notation abuse is called.  The application then loads dylib B.  The symbol for codefoocode is rebound to codeBfoocode.  Subsequent calls to codefoocode always call codeBfoocode, furthermore codefoocode can never be rebound as dylib B defines codefoocode to be strong.p  pCorrectp  pAs I write this, logically I can only conclude that it must be indeed Ive verified this behaviour with an example.  The behaviour is effectively the same as what happens during static linking.  My surprise was that dynamic rebinding could actually occur, as you can imagine that it could lead to some weird behaviour if a function can change implementation part way through execution.p  pN.B. I stubled over this when overriding codeoperator newcode in a dylib.  Since libc implicitly exports codeoperator newcode as weak the scenario above arose.p  pPresumably the moral is that if you use weak dynamic symbols then you must be very sure you know what youre doing p

Positive 10851 pstrongemcodeX32codeemstrong is an ABI for codeamd64codecodex8664code CPUs using 32bit pointers. The idea is to combine the larger register set of x8664 with the smaller memory and cache footprint resulting from 32bit pointers. It provides up to about a 40 speedup. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq7635013Difference between x86, x32, and x64 architecturesa on Stack Overflow, and the Debian a hrefhttpwiki.debian.orgX32Port relnofollowX32 Portsa wiki page for details and setting it up as a chroot environment.p  pWe have a bug report from a Debian maintainer under the environment. The report is codeadcqcode is an illegal instruction. The inline assembly is activated based on preprocessor macros, so we are not detecting X32 properly or more correctly, not at all until now.p  pThe most obvious choice to me for a preprocessor macro is something like codeX32code, but thats not offered. Based on a hrefhttplists.llvm.orgpipermailcfecommitsWeekofMon20140714109910.html relnofollowClangs patcha and a hrefhttpwiki.debian.orgX32Port relnofollowDebians suggestiona, it looks like codeILP32code can be used. But Id like a more canonical answer since codeILP32code and codecodemodelsmallcode look interesting, too. And Im aware of issues with SSE2, where the compiler supported it but the OS did not.p  pWhat are the preprocessor macros that can be used to reliably detect an X32 ABI and environment when using Clang and GCCp  pTo be clear, Im not trying to fix the code at this point.

Positive 10851 pSo Ive been working on compiling a static version of MySQL and a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypimysqlclient2022MySQLclient relnofollowMySQLclientpythona. Ive been completely successful up to this point where Im trying to understand a libSystem.B.dylib dependency that MySQLclientpython has. p  pTo make it clear, MySQLclientpython is a python wrapper around the MySQL C Library. This results in the need to compile MySQLclientpython before it is used. This is currently working on OS X 10.7, and my goal is to create a compiled version of MySQLclientpython that will work on multiple versions of OS X bundling libmysql is already taken care of. Right now, I am compiling MySQLclientpython perfectly fine, and it works on 10.7. However, when its testing on 10.8, it breaks. To compile MySQLclientpython, Im using python 3.5 and running p  precodepython setup.py build codepre  pThis results in two things happening. First, a mysql.o object file is compiled using a command similar to a hrefhttpsgist.github.comalexggordone55e4518524e23a1ce11 relnofollowthisa. Then, a shared object file is compiled using a hrefhttpsgist.github.comalexggordon04dc816bae6ff18bbe02 relnofollowthis scripta. To be clear, those commands are mostly generated by setup.py.p  pThe resulting build has the structurep  precode.  setup.py  build      mysql.so      MySQLdb      mysqlexceptions.py codepre  pNow, when running p  precode otool L mysql.so mysql.so usrliblibSystem.B.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 159.1.0 codepre  pIt clearly shows theres a dependency on libSystem.B.dylib. Now dependencies arent an issue in general, and this works fine on 10.7. I can import the python module and use it correctly. However, when switching to 10.11, this same module no produces ap  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt   File .MySQLdbinit.py, line 19, in ltmodulegt import mysql   ImportError dlopen.mysql.so, 2 Symbol not found      ZNSt8iosbase4InitD1Ev   Referenced from .mysql.so   Expected in flat namespace in .mysql.so codepre  pObviously, my first thought is that theres a problem with the dependency. I do believe that is the issue. To be honest though, Im not sure where to go from here. Obviously, OS X strongly discourages static linking, so I didnt look into that for long. Just to be clear once more, my goal is just to be able to use this on multiple OS X platforms 10.710.11 and this currently works on 10.7. Any ideasp

Positive 10851 pAlternate title Why does my dylib include extra exported symbols when compiled by Xcode vs Makefilep  pMy company builds a c dynamic library dylib on the Mac using clang and we recently ported our hand crafted Makefile to the CMake build system and are now using the generated Xcode projects. After ensuring that all the compilerlinker flags and environment variables matched exactly between the two systems, we noticed that the dylib created by CMakeXcode was slightly larger. Closer examination showed that it contained some additional exported symbols from templated functions that were never referenced and therefore should never have been instantiated  the specific templates had their definitions and specializations in the source files as we use explicit instantiation frequently, although in this case they were not explicitly instantiated. Examining the disassembly of some of the object files showed slight instruction differences as well. The only thing that got the libraries to match in size and symbols exactly was to strongmatch the order of the compiler flags exactlystrong. This appears to demonstrate some order dependent interaction between compiler flags which seems like a compiler bug or at least poorly documented behavior.p  pFor this specific issue, these were the compiler invocationsp  precodeclang fvisibilityhidden fvisibilitymscompat c foo.cpp o foo.o  clang fvisibilitymscompat fvisibilityhidden c foo.cpp o foo.o codepre  pAnd this was the linker invocationp  precodeclang dynamiclib o libfoo.dylib foo.o codepre  pDisplaying the exported symbols withp  precodenm g libfoo.dylib codepre  pshowed the differences.

Negative 10851 pIm just beginning to use Regex so bear with my terminology. I have a regex pattern that is working properly on a string. The string could be in the format text [pattern] text. Therefore, I also have a regex pattern that negates the first pattern. If I print out the results from each of the matches everything is shown correctly. p  pThe problem Im having is I want to add text into the string and it changes the index of matches in a regex MatchCollection. For example, if I wanted to enclose the found match in td match td tags I have the following codep  precodeRegex r  new RegexnegRegexPattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase  RegexOptions.Singleline             MatchCollection mc  r.Matchestext             if mc.Count gt 0                              for int i  0 i lt mc.Count i                                      text  text.Removemc[i].Index, mc[i].Length                     text  text.Insertmc[i].Index, lttdgt  mc[i].Value  lttdgt                                               codepre  pThis works great for the first match. But as youd expect the mc[i].Index is no longer valid because the string has changed. Therefore, I tried to search for just a single match in the for loop for the amount of matches I would expect mc.Count, but then I keep finding the first match.p  pSo hopefully without introducing more regex to make sure its not the first match and with keeping everything in one string, does anybody have any input on how I could accomplish this Thanks for your input.p  pEdit Thank you all for your responses, I appreciate all of them.p

Negative 10851 pIn order to handle settings for different deployment targets, I moved application settings from app.config to its own file and included that file in app.config via configSource. I also created a settings file for each target.Here is an illustrationp  precodeProject A    app.config references settings.config    settings.config     settings.Release.config    settings.Debug.config codepre  pDuring postbuild, I copy the appropriate settings.configuration.config to the output directory. This is working fine so far and I can see settings.config file in the project output directory containing settings for the current build configuration Release, Debug, etc.p  pHowever, I am having a problem with the setup project that I have for this project Project A. Initially, it was not including settings.config file. So I set the build action for settings.config file as Content and I added content files from Project A to the setup project. This ensured that settings.config file was included in the setup. However, since the setup project appears to be picking settings.config file from the project directory instead of the output directory, settings.config file included in the setup is not what it should be. I want the one from the output directory to be included in the setup program since that one is the correct one for the current build configuration.  I tried the followingp  ul liAdded settings.config as a file to the setup project. However, it seems like I can only specify absolute path. So when I add it from the output directory of a particular build configuration ..bindebugsettings.config, it does not work in other build configuration since ..bindebugsettings.config does exist in the directory specified. I looked into using relative paths or dynamic paths in the setup project where the build configuration could be specifed as part of the path but I could not find anything.li ul  pI considered using prebuild event to actually modify settings.config file in the project directory and then have it copied over the output directory by setting its Copy to Output Directory to copy always or copy if newer. This should ensure that the appropriate settings.config is copied to the output directory just like the postbuild based solution and should also ensure that the contents of settings.config file is updated before the setup project includes it. However, I dont like this solution because I would have to make sure settings.config file is writeable before I can make any changes since it is source controlled. If it is readonly, then I need to flip it to writeable, make changes, and then set it to readonly again. It is adding extra complexity.p  pI was wondering if anyone has a better idea or knows a setup project trick that allows me to include settings.config file appropriate for the current build configuration in the setup program.p  pThanksp

Negative 10851 pHey all, Im completely stumped with this iPhone problem.p  pThis is my first time building a view programmatically, without a nib.

Negative 10851 pIve been working nonstop for the last three days on a completely managed interface to Erlang. At this point, Ive decided that there simply must be an easier way. Ive got a little over 3000 lines and its not even in a compilable state yet. To be honest, Im getting lost in my own code.p  pSo, I then remembered that Erlang has a C library called erlinterface. Unfortunately, it only comes as a .LIB file, which isnt usable via PInvoke. Im now investigating ways to expose the static library through a DLL.p  pId like to stay away from Visual C, mostly because Im not a CC programmer by nature and I find it really difficult to configure. TinyC is my compiler of choice when working with anything in C.p  pHow can I go about thisp  pI know I can link erlinterface to a DLL, but how can I expose the functions Do I have to essentially wrap each and every one of them in my own exports That probably wont be a problem, since I could write a script to generate the code from the header file. But is there an easier way that I just dont know aboutp  pemAlso, please dont recommend OTP.NET. Its a nice library, but Im looking to use this is a large project, so Id like to keep it inhouse.emp

Evaluating the impact of my changes on the performance of the CPU, I used a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenussysinternalsbb896653.aspx relnofollowProcess Explorera to watch, roughly, what my app was doing. To my surprise, it appears to be doing what Process Explorer reports as IO. In general, this is related to Disk IO or Network IO.

Negative 10851 pI have Windows form C application that takes values from the GUI and uses XML Textwriter to create an XML file from them. The problem is some of these values are meant to be optional and when the user leaves them blank, the application gets a null reference exception because the text stream is null. Without doing a check on every value, is there a way to exception handle the whole thing to ignore null values Trycatch doesnt seem work in this regard because it wont return the cursor to the next statement. Sorry if this is a n00bish questionp

Negative 10851 pI will be building a system where a particular object will originate from a web service SOAP based. It will then be displayed on a web page via PHP. Under certain circumstances well store a copy with some additional information in a local MySQL database. And from there it will be batch processed into Salesforce CRM again via PHP. We may also subsequently pull the object out of Salesforce for display online. So alot going on. For the most part the object is the same with each subsequent node in the system likely adding a couple of fields specific to it, unique ids mainly.p  pId initially toyed with the idea of encapsulating all the necessary functionality into the one class in PHP which would deal with reading and writing from each of the appropriate sources. This felt like it was over complicating the class, and not a good approach.p  pI then looked at having just a container class, with no real functionality attached beyond getters and setters. Then creating separate functionality outside of this to deal with the reading and writing between the different sources, simple enough code although tedious to map between all the different field names across the different sources. There is probably a design pattern or two that apply here, but Im not familiar with them. Any and all suggestions on how to approach this appreciated.p

Im running on Windows 7.p  pMy end goal is to respond properly to when the Process stops responding i.e. Process.Responding  false so that I can kill the application and restart it.

For instance grouping of applications by criticality in a pie chart.p  pIn order to create these n number of reports what we thought is to transfer the sharepoint list to sql server using SSIS and then use sql server reporting services SSRS to generate those reports and then use an ASP .net front end to contain the reports.p  pThe very first important question is whether we can transfer sharepoint list to SQL Server using SSIS. Is this possiblep

Negative 10851 pOne of my apps has an initialdata.json file in fixtures, which works great when using vanilla django to specify some initial data. However, when migrating using South, when it steps through Loading initial data for  I get an IntegrityError, because duplicate data already exists. This makes sense, because my migration didnt empty the table, so the initial data from previous calls to syncdb is already there.p  pHow can I either 1 tell South to not load initial data while migrating, or 2 modify initialdata.json or other django files so that duplicate data errors are handled gracefully, instead of crashing the migrate process in southp

Negative 10851 pI am currently prototyping an enterprise web app which will include a quick search screen. This screen uses JQuery and Datatables to provide a tabular view of the search results. Searches are performed based on matches to string entered in a text field. Each time a key is pressed, a new AJAX request is sent back to a servlet, the search is performed across a large database and results are returned via JSON to be updated on the table.p  pThe search on the database is a costly operation. A lot of times when a user is typing, say, a name, they would type a number of letters in quick succession. This will result in multiple searches being triggered in the backend, sometimes unnecessarily. p  pI was wondering if there is a way of cleverly buffering those request. For example, if a user is typing Jonathan, do not send a request for J, Jo, Jona, Jonath, ... if they are all typed within a time limit of each other, and only send the request when there is a sufficient gap in typing, i.e. when the letter n at the end is typed.p  pI know this will cost a slight delay but it may be a worthy compromise.p  pDo you think think this makes sense Is there an existing patternlibrary for such operations Does it cause usability issues that I havent thought ofp  pGreatly appreciate your opinionsp
Negative 10851 pIve been looking through all StackOverflow in the bazillion of questions about capitalizing a word in Java, and none of them seem to care the least about internationalization and as a matter of fact none really seem to work in an international context. So here is my question.p  pI have a String in Java, which represents a word  all isLetter characters, no whitespace. I want to make the first character upper case and the rest lower case. I do have the locale of my word in handy.p  pIts easy enough to call .substring1.toLowerCaseLocale for the last part of my string. I have no idea how to get the correct first character, though.p  pThe first problem I have is with Dutch, where ij being a digraph should be capitalized together. I could specialcase this by hand, because I know about it now there may be other languages with this kind of thing that I dont know about, and Im sure Unicode will tell me if I ask nicely. But I dont know how to ask.p  pEven if the above problem is solved, Im still stuck with no proper way to handle English, Turkish and Greek, because Character supports titlecase but no locale, and String supports locales but not titlecase.p  pIf I take the code point, and pass it to Character.toTitleCase, this will fail because there is no way to pass the locale to this method. So if the system locale is in English but the word is Turkish, and the first char of the word is i, Ill get I instead of  and this is wrong. Now if I take a substring and use .toUpperCaseLocale, this will fail because its upper and not title case. So if the word is Greek, Ill still get the wrong character.p  pIf anyone has useful pointers, Id be happy to hear them.p

Both of those, however, seem to be comparing SQLite to parsing XML at run time. I dont know if the same issues apply to using string and int resource arrays. I actually have a number of unknowns and Id appreciate any insights others can offer.p  pData details about 40 books three languages per book average book length 25 chapters average chapter length 25 paragraphs about 75,000 paragraphs total. Text is stored by paragraph no finer granularity needed. For each language, the apps logical view of the text is as a single array of paragraphs spanning all the books. There are also table of contents TOC data down to the paragraph level. All the data are strictly readonly. I need to support two query types 1 retrieve the text for a paragraph or range of paragraphs in a specified language 2 given a paragraph number, determine the book, chapter, and paragraph offset in the chapter. I dont need to use any of SQLites string functions.p  pMy analysis so farp  pstrongSQLitestrong Create an SQLite data base offline, package it as a raw resource or asset, and copy it to the data base location when the app is run for the first time andor upgraded. I have a implemented a prototype data base for this with half a dozen tables.p  ol liCan use SQL to query data base, so dont need to code any search algorithms.li liI know it can handle this much data.li liRequires several SQL range queries to answer type 2 queries.li liRequires twice the space in the .apk file and again when installed into the apps db area.li liAndroids SQLite implementation requires external storage SD card, so app wont work without one. Amazons a hrefhttpsdeveloper.amazon.comhelpfaq.htmlKindleFire relnofollowguidelines for Kindle Fire appsa state that apps cannot require an SD card, so going this way might rule out Kindle Fire compatibility. Badli ol  pstrongResourcesstrong Create a collection of xml array resource files offline and copy them to the projects resvalues folder. Text would be partitioned into many string arrays one array per chapter per book. There would be about 3,000 arrays. Indexes would be implemented as int arrays. For each book, the index data would be shared across languages. Id probably also need to generate some typed array resources to provide an index into the generated resource IDs. I expect that the index arrays are small enough to load entirely into memory at app startup.p  ol liType 1 queries involve loading the correct string arrays and accessing array elements. Type 2 queries involve binary search of the already loaded index data.li liDont know whether the resources system in Android can handle that many resource arrays.li liDont know what the performance would be compared to using SQLite.li ol  pI suppose a hybrid approach is also possible store the TOC data one way and the text itself in another.p  pAgain, Id appreciate any thoughts or insights that would help with this analysis.p

When moving from chunk to chunk, there is always a tiny burst of lag which results in a little jump because the game must wait for the terrain to generate before it moves the camera more.

Maybe something like thisp  precodeUpdate ifcam  prevcam  thread.start   codepre  pAnd then after the other thread is done with the generation it suspends itself somehow and restarts next time the camera position has changed.

Negative 10851 pIv been reading through the Apple Docs, read through a couple tutorials online, and even watched the CS193p lectures on iCloud however there is still one thing Im not clear aboutp  pTake the case where you have an application that syncs documents to iCloud.  How do you allow the user to still viewedit existing documents and create new documents while heshe is not able to reach the iCloud service airplane mode, network not available, etc...p  pFor example. The reminders application in iOS5 allows the user to viewedit existing documents that reside on iCloud even though you may be in airplane mode.  The changes are then propagated the next time the iCloud service is available.p  pThis seems really strange to me.  How do you populate a list of reminders if your metadata query isnt provided a valid URL to a ubiquitous container  ie., calling codeURLForUbiquityContainerIdentifiercode will return nil since iCloud is not available.  Then creating a metadata query isnt possible because you cant provide it a URL to query on. Hence, you cant populate a list of documents for the user to view and edit offline.p  pAny help or insight to how this is done is greatly apprecaitedp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOk  I stumbled upon this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7798555icloudcaniignorethosewhodisableicloudhereap  pIts basically talking about how files are stored in the file system when using iCloud.  From what I gather whenever a file is created on iCloud its basically kept in a special extended local storage container that is created when you first call codeURLForUbiquityContainerIdentifiercode.  This special directory is managed by the iCloud deamon.   In addition to being stored in this special directory the document is also uploaded to the cloud for use by other applications.p  pNow  assuming my assumption above is correct, the question is  strongIf iCloud suddenly is not available, how do you access the files stored by the local daemonstrongp

Negative 10851 pSo I just finished the railstutorial.org twitter clone example and I want to put it online with my web hosting provider bluehost. Right now all I have is a file called sampleapp with all of the rails stuff in it. And it works fine when I visit it on localhost3000. p  pSo I go to my bluehost file manager and there are 9 different folders, like publichtml, publicftp, railsapps, www, tmp, accesslogs, ect. Ive uploaded sampleapp into this overall directory and into the publichtml directory itself. But when I visit my website it just displays the html in a default.html file in the publichtml directory. p  pWhat exactly is telling my hosting service to use publichtmldefault.html of any of the hundereds of different files and folders that are in other places on my server space How do I find this thing and tell it to instead use sampleapp or publichtmlsampleapp and then process everything in that to display my rails application p  pIve tried using bluehost support and they emailed me and said this would be accomplished by creating a symlink which links railsappsNinetyNinepublic to publichtml. I have no idea how to do this and the guides I find online all tell me to enter a series of commands. I dont know whether to do this in a terminal on my ubuntu system or some command prompt that bluehost provides. If it is at a terminal on my system which directory should I be in any attempts I have made on my system have resulted in a no such file or directory error. When I asked bluehost to explain this they said that this was outside of the scope of their support and had to do with web development not hosting. It struck me as odd that they were unwilling to explain their own response to my problem but whatever. p  pIf anyone of you could  help me or point me in the right direction I would very much appreciate it. Thank youp

Negative 10851 pIm using the DynamicPage jQuery plugin to make my pages not reload when navigating. On the index page is a image slider plugin called CoinSlider. The dynamic page works fine, except when  I click to go back to the index page where the image slider is. For some reason from what I can tell the CoinSlider ready function isnt activating when it goes back to the index. May be something to do with the URL, as host.comindex.php works but host.comindex.php does not. Any reason why its doing this Ive tried including the ready function in the DynamicPage function in the js file to execute whenever the page changes, but it didnt help.

Negative 10851 pIm trying to have a load progress bar in my game, and I have a function assigned to the onloadeddata attribute on my audio, but it is not triggering in Chrome. It works in other browsers. I also tried many other events such as oncanplay, oncanplaythrough, onloadedmetadata, etc. None of them trigger.p  pI think it might have to do with the caching. Tried looking around and there was some reports of this from 23 years ago but nothing recent.p  pIs there any other way I could detect if the audio is loaded, or make these events workp  pEDIT Heres a quick example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3vxCu1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net3vxCu1a Works in opera and firefox, but not in Chrome.

Negative 10851 pI have a custom View subclass that allows the user to sketch out a Chinese character. The line coordinates are saved to a float array x1, y1, x2, y2, x2, y2, x3, y3... which is scaled to unit size, i.e. all coordinates are values between zero and one. This makes it easier when later on the sketch is animated in a view of a different size. It also helps to compare what was drawn with another animation in the same coordinate space. The coordinates are flipped vertically, also to aid with that comparison.p  pWhat that means is that when the lines are sketched in the Views onDraw method the Canvas has to be scaled up and translated before a call to drawLines plots the sketch.p  pOn all devices in the office Android 2.3 everything displays normally, and the emulator is okay too. However, two users with Samsung Galaxy S2 phones, who both report recently upgrading to Android 4, find that the lines appear gappy as shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDkqaA.png altIllustrates problemp  pIve tried switching away from drawLines to using Path objects instead, but in this case the users reported that the lines didnt show up at allp  pHeres how I configure the paintp  precode    paint  new Paint             paint.setStyleStyle.STROKE     paint.setStrokeWidthkTCDrawPathWidth     paint.setStrokeCapCap.ROUND     paint.setStrokeJoinJoin.BEVEL     paint.setColorColor.WHITE codepre  pAnd this is where I plot the sketchp  precode    RectF frame  getDrawingBounds        canvas.drawRoundRectframe, 3, 3, drawAreaFramePaint           canvas.drawRoundRectframe, 3, 3, drawAreaFrameBorderPaint      canvas.save     canvas.translateframe.left, frame.topframe.height     canvas.scaleframe.width, frame.height      for TCPath path  paths         canvas.drawLinespath.getLines, paint      if drawingPathnull         canvas.drawLinesdrawingPath.getLines, paint      canvas.restore codepre  pAny glaring issues there Was there a change to PaintCanvas behaviour in Android 4p

Negative 10851 pWe have ABCPDF 8 available to work with for this case. We need to rebuild an existing PDF with markup and texts in it with text that comes from a CMS. What we basicly want to do is use an existing PDF and replace blocks of text and images with the ones our content editors specify in Sitecore. I have been looking at the documentation of ABCPDF but its kind of overwelming at this point, cause its the first time Im trying to do anything with dynamically building a PDF.

Negative 10851 pCan someone explain to me LempelZiv 76 complexity  I was under the impression that you initialize with the first letter of the string in your dictionary, and then check subsequent blocks for existence in the previous substring, growing one letter each time a substring is found.  If no substring exists in the previous substring, that substring is called a block and the next letter becomes the next substring to be searched.  p  pFor example,p  precode01011010001101110010 codepre  pcode01codep  psince 1 is not in 0, we get code010codep  psince 0 is in 01, we get code0101codep  psince 01 is in 01, we get code010110codep  psince 0 is in 01011, we get code0101101codep  psince 01 is in 01011, we get code01011010codep  psince 010 is in 01011, we get code0101101000codep  pand so on until, we get code01011010001101110010code,p  pwhere the last letter can be a repeat if necessary.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  Because I am being told that for a string 1111111, the decomposition is 1111111.

Next time I want to download the same issue I execute the same code again  downloadWithDelegate . However this doesnt do anything. It is as if the NKAssetDownload instance still uses the same NSURLConnection that I previously canceled so it doesnt launch the download. The real problem is that I cannot remove the NKAssetDownload from the NKIssue and therefore cannot create a new one pointing at the same URL to retry the download. As far as I can tell there is no way of canceling a download and retrying it later, other than deleting the NKIssue from the library which throws away everything and recreating it. Does anyone know how to do thisp  pThere is a related question on S.O. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8646121isitpossibletocancelannkassetdownloadIs it possible to cancel an NKAssetDownloada   but the only solution provided there is to delete the NKIssue, and that is not what I want to do.p

Negative 10851 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3534449whydoesrubyhavebothprivateandprotectedmethodsWhy does Ruby have both private and protected methodsa  p blockquote    pAs a Java and Smalltalk programmer I stumbled upon Rubys private and protected access modifiers, and quite frankly I dont get them.p  pI do understand that the sole difference between private and protected is that private methods dont allow explicit receivers with the exception of private setters, where private methods may have an explicit receiver. Other than that, there seems to be no difference or all the resources I found are that shallow that they only point out this difference. So to me it seems that making a method private instead of protected doesnt add any value to the code except maybe for annoying programmers, who follow the general OOP convention of every method being a message to an object, thus always having an explicit receiver.p  pEspecially, as Ruby seems to follow the Smalltalk philosophy in that privateprotected is more like a suggestion than a mechanism that strictly forbids the usage using the sendmethod to bypass the effects of privateprotected, it doesnt make sense to me to differentiate.p  pSo I wonder, is there any reason where it makes sense to have both private and protected in Ruby Do you have any scenarios where using the one or the other makes a huge difference other than just forbidding explicit receivers If not, why does Ruby bother in having both Wouldnt just having protected be sufficientp

Negative 10851 pIm using primefaces 3.3 with JSF 2.1.

Negative 10851 pIm about ready to release 6 apps on the Google Play market, and a guy at work brought in a new phone that was running a version of android that the manifest file stated was supported and it didnt work as expected even though it did work on the emulator. This brought up the question ofp  blockquote   pShort of buying every device, how can we ensure that our apps will work on all devices that run the versions of android that the manifest file says it supportsp blockquote  pIs there a suggested way to do this The combinations of different screen sizes, densities, and android versions can make development for android a real pain.p  pEditp  pThe part that didnt work as expected was some of the javascript calls. Especially calls like window.width and window.height, the width was reported as the height and the height was reported as the width on 2.3.4, but not 2.1, or 3. Another issue, also with 2.3.4 and javascript was the window.openurl, target call would only call the codeshouldOverrideUrlLoadingcode on my codeWebViewClientcode the first time for each target rather than every time. Again, it worked with 2.1 and 3. p  pCurrently, I test on devices running 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 4.0.3, and 4.0.4. I also test on emulators running 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.3, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1 with various screen sizes and densities. The javascript bugs are not present on the 2.3.3 or any of the other emulators, which is why I would rather test on devices, they give me a more accurate feel of what the user will run intop

Negative 10851 pI have a Viewmodel that contains property named Projects and strongUsersstrong. The Project class contains Project Manager, Date, AssignedTo properties. In my view I have a Grid where my itemsource is bound to Projects and have datacolumns bounded to Project Manager, Date and Assigned To.p  pNow I added a cell edit template to AssignedTo column by adding an autocomplete textbox so when the user edits that column it will give auto suggested User values. My problem now is that I am wanting that the ItemSource of this autocomplete textbox to be bound to the property of my ViewModel which is strongUsersstrongwhich is a list of string. Since the grid is already bounded to the Project how can I force the celledit template to bind into the other property in my ViewModel which is the strongUsersstrong. p  pI understand that there are some ways to do this such as attaching another presentation property to Projects but I do not want to do that as this class is used a lot in my application. I did try different types of bindings e.g. relativesource but nothing seems to work fine at this stage. Maybe I am missing something or really there is no way to do thisp

This is not a synchronization question, I learned how to synchronize methods and use locks. This question concerns immutable objects and their relationship with multithreading. I read everywhere that an immutable object is thread safe, so that it can be shared among threads fearless. But IMHO its not true at all So can you please provide me an example where an immutable object is shared among different threads and its use doesnt need to be synchronized Thanks guys.p

Negative 10851 pIve added the like button to my website trying both the XFBML and HTML5 versions and all three forms of the button layouts to try to fix this problem.  People can like my website, but there is no working comment box.  Strangely, it worked last night, but a friend called me this morning that the comment box comes up, they could type a comment, but nothing at all happens when they click to post it.  I tried it again myself and the comment box flashes up for a split second, only to disappear again without the possibility of leaving a comment.p  pI am quite knowledgable with coding and Ive followed the steps exactly, plugging the generated code into my html as directed.  For the XFBML, the generated JS SDK code has been plugged in right after the opening body tag, Ive added the xmlnsfbhttpogp.mensfb code into the html tag, and added the button code in my content code.  My data is being recorded in Insights and it even shows that a few comments were recorded yesterday. Any ideas what could be wrong all of a sudden Thanks in advance. Lorip

Negative 10851 pI am using sessions to store items in a users wish list.p  pThe wishlist is stored as a simple array of unique item ids  An average user would store around 40 items in the wish list but it is possible that a user may wish to add as many as a few hundred items in their wish list.p  pI would like to generate a unique URL so that they can revisit their wishlist later, or share the wishlist with others who could use it as a starting point for their own lists.p  pI am not collecting any data from the user, and they will not have an account to link their wishlist data with.p  pThe 2 methods of dealing with this that I am considering arep  pStoring the data as a hash on the end of the URL, either as a url encoded serialised string or base64 encoded string. This seems preferable as I will not need to store the wishlists and this offers a large amount of flexibility for users to modify existing lists, however I suspect that this will become unworkable if the number of items in the wishlist increases and the URL length grows beyond workable character counts.p  pORp  pGenerate a url with a unique Id and save the wishlist to the database. The problem I see with this is that a new entry will be added to the database every time a user wishes to generate a URL, and since these entries wont be tied to any one user, a new entry will need to be generated every time a user makes any modification to a list. p  pIs there another better approach to handling this, or a way to manage the problems associated with the above methodsp

Negative 10851 pI have a thorough background in .NET but have been using Python and Ruby lately. I found myself pondering how to best provide dependencies to objects that need them in Ruby.p  pAt first thought, I did not actually think DI and IoC frameworks would be required to interact with dependencies because of the leniency of dynamic languages a la redefinition, mixins, stubs, etc. Then, however, I came across answers as to why DIIoC frameworks are strongnot neededstrong in dynamic languages. The reasons provided dont sit too well with me. Im hoping I can see an example that might clear things up.p  h2Recommended suggestions that I kind of disagree withh2  h3Reason 1 A dependent class can be changed at run time think testingh3  pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2273683whyareioccontainersunnecessarywithdynamiclanguages23084942308494Why are IOC containers unnecessary with dynamic languagesa we see that a dependent class noninjected, say codeXcode, can be stubbed or mocked in a test. Sure, but that requires us to know our codeSystem Under Testcode is depending on something called codeXcode. If our codeSystem Under Testcode suddenly depends on codeNcode instead of codeXcode, we must now remember to mock codeNcode instead of codeXcode. The benefit of using DI is wed never accidentally run a test with production dependencies because wed always be passing in mocked dependencies.p  h3Reason 2 Subclass or use constructor injection for testingh3  pIn everyones favorite goto resource for all things DI  Ruby, a hrefhttpweblog.jamisbuck.org2008119legosplaydohandprogrammingLEGOs, PlayDoh, and Programminga, we see an example of subclassing a System Under Test to mock dependencies. Alternatively, we can use constructor injection. Okay, so codeBcode depends on codeAcode. We call codeB.getdependencycode which provides codeBcode with an instance of codeAcode. But what if codeAcode depends on codeNcode which depends on codeXcode Must we call codegetdependencycode on each successive object in the chainp  h3Reason 3 Dependencies can be mixed in or monkeypatchedh3  pa hrefhttpfabiokung.com20100506rubyanddependencyinjectioninadynamicworldFabio mentionsa we can just use mixinsmonkeypatch. So codeXcode is mixedin to codeNcode. But The issue is what if codeXcode depends on codeAcode which depends on codeBcode Do we just use mixins for every dependency down the chain I see how that can work but it could get messy and confusing quickly.p  hr  pSide note a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comsearchqdependency20injection20dynamic20languageMany users saya DI frameworks are not needed in dynamic languages. However, Angular.JS has really benefited from implementing a pretty solid DI system. Angular is built on JavaScript, a dynamic language. Is this approach comparable to Ruby or Pythonp  pPlease keep in mind Im not saying I want to emforceem DIIoC into Ruby, Python, etc.p

I would then derive a codeDeparturecode and an codeArrivalcode class from the codeMovementcode, and have the codeFlightcode reference one of both.p  pThen I bumped into a discussion on Rubys codeTrueClasscode and codeFalseClasscode a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3192978whydoesrubyhavetrueclassandfalseclassinsteadofasinglebooleanclassWhy does Ruby have TrueClass and FalseClass instead of a single Boolean classa. The gist of it was that Ruby does not model codetruecode and codefalsecode as a codeBooleancode because they do not share any behavior and I believe the same goes for an arrival and a departure. They are exactly opposite even though they do share data.p  pAnother option is that I simply embed the arrival and departures data fields in the codeFlightcode. I find this awkward because that would mean that if you would traverse from the codeAirportcode model to the departures and arrivals codehasmany departurescode, codehasmany arrivalscode would yield a codeFlightcode model.p  pA third option I explored is creating separate codeDeparturecode and codeArrivalcode models without inheriting from a codeMovementcode. However, since a codeFlightcode is required to have both and arrival and a departure, which are required to reference flight, we have created a nasty circular reference which also plagues the first option, by the way.p  pHow would I best model this relationship Are there any alternatives I have failed to considerp
Negative 10851 pI have an entity which is showed on the screen as text in input boxes which can be modified. When i submit the form hitting save, i would like my ejb3 component to handle the data and persist or merge it using the entity manager. But for some reason, when i modify the data and hit save the data directly gets updated in the database bypasing my ejb3, which is certainly undesirable.

Negative 10851 h1Backgroundh1  pI need to build a RichClient application using .NET. The app needs to handle TreeViewControls and TableViewControls with about 100000 entities.

Herere my thoughts p  h1Conceptual Layersh1  h2Presentation Layerh2  pjust the WPF Controls, Id need performant synchronizing of different controls on property changes, but I dont anticipate major problems here.p  h2Business Layerh2  pcreating views object selections to be displayed in the controls, CRUD operations modifications done directly with the POCOs, searching global search, but also limited to a viewp  h2Repositoryh2  pholds POCOs in an enitity map, decides weather to load from persistence storep  h2PersistenceManagerh2  pIm thinking of using a LocalDB or simple KeyValue Store as persistent ClientCache. So, the PersistenceManager would try to get an object from the local store. Otherwise get the data from the server. Also, persisting data to the ClientCache. The data would be available via a webservice.

But I dont see yet how to plug these frameworks into the above layering. Also, where to track changes Where to secure consistency when deleting objects e.g. deleting references to these objects as wellli liI would eager load whole views hierarchical structures and perform Linq to objects to those collections of POCOs. Maybe implement a simple inverted index if Linq performance would become a matter. But how should I best implement global searches on the server Are there libraries Linq to OData availableli liWhat do you think about a fully diconnected scenario Holding all data a user needs in a local database. Sync on start  stop and user triggered. I could use an ORM directly on the local DB, with good chances to save a lot of headaches trying to implement a lot of consistency features by hand using the above layering.li liOr in contrast, forget about the local database and batch eager load most of the needed data. Here Im concerned about the performance of the webservices without having experience with OData, WCF. Ive build an app using Redis and Python that loads about 200000 business objects quite fast lt 1 min to the client the objects are already serialized cached in Redis.li ul  pIll certainly do some prototyping and benchmarking, but to get a good start, any thoughts and recommendations are highly appreciate.p  pCheers,p  pJanp

Negative 10851 pIm working on a program that takes in a bunch y of integers and then needs to return the x highest integers in order. This code needs to be as fast as possible, but at the moment I dont think I have the best algorithm.p  pMy approachalgorithm so far is to create a sorted list of integers high to low that have already been input and then handle each item as it comes in. For the first x items, I maintain a sorted array of integers, and when each new item comes in, I figure out where it should be placed using a binary sort. Im also considering just taking in the first x items and then quick sorting them, but I dont know if this is faster After the first x items have been sorted I then consider the rest of the items by first seeing if they qualify to enter the already sorted list of highest integers by seeing if the new integer is greater than the integer at the end of the list and if it does, add it to the sorted list via a binary search and remove the integer at the end of the list. p  pI was wondering if anyone had any advice as to how I can make this faster, or perhaps an entire new approach that is faster than this. Thanks. p

Negative 10851 pI am using the Strategy Pattern, together with the Abstract Factory Pattern to generate different algorithms in a Calculator class during runtime. p  pThe calculations will depend on a Relationship between involved types. This is why I made  the Algorithmcalculate a member function template, generic with respect to a Relationship. p  pHowever, I already have an algorithm that is completely implementationbased in the existing code, it is notgeneric nor iteratorbased, and I want to add it to the algorithm hierarchy so that I can produce it using the AbstractFactory as well and see how it behaves. p  pAn implemenation based algorithm uses the member functions of the types involved in the calculations to get the calculation done. In this example, it would use RelationshipWithAtargettype member functions to access the data of the Typeamp, as well as A member functions to access the data of RelationshipWithAa.p  pThis is what I came up with so far this is just a model, without the Abstract Factory, and the Calculator class p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  class Result   class A     class B      public          void specific const                        stdcout ltlt Bspecific ltlt stdendl            class C  public B   class D   templateltclass Typegt class RelationshipWithA      const Aamp a       const Typeamp t      public          typedef Type targettype           RelationshipWithA const Aamp a, const Typeamp t                              aa,                  tt                       stdcout ltlt RelationshipWithActor ltlt stdendl                    const Aamp a const                       return a                    const Typeamp type const                      return t            class DefaultAlgorithm       public         template ltclass Relationshipgt         void calculate Resultamp res, const Relationshipamp r                      stdcout ltlt DefaultAlgorithmcalculate ltlt stdendl             const Aamp a  r.a              const typename Relationshiptargettypeamp t  r.type               Default iterator based calculation on a, targettype and r            class AlternativeAlgorithm        public DefaultAlgorithm       public         template ltclass Relationshipgt         void calculate Resultamp res, const Relationshipamp r                      stdcout ltlt AlternativeAlgorithmcalculate ltlt stdendl              Optimized iterator based calculation on a, targettype and r            class ImplementationBasedAlgorithm       public DefaultAlgorithm       public          No specialization Relationships store          a const reference to any class that inherits from B         template ltclass Relationshipgt         void calculate Resultamp res, const Relationshipamp r                       Use B implementation and the Relationship With  A to compute the result             stdcout ltlt ImplementationBasedAlgorithmcalculate ltlt stdendl             const Aamp a  r.a              const Bamp b  r.type             b.specific              Implementation based on B implementation            int mainint argc, const char argv[]      Result res       A a      C c       RelationshipWithAltCgt relationshipAC a, c      DefaultAlgorithm defaultAlg      AlternativeAlgorithm alternativeAlg     ImplementationBasedAlgorithm implementationAlg      defaultAlg.calculateres, relationshipAC     alternativeAlg.calculateres, relationshipAC     implementationAlg.calculateres,relationshipAC      D d      RelationshipWithAltDgt relationshipAD a, d      defaultAlg.calculateres, relationshipAD     alternativeAlg.calculateres, relationshipAD      This fails, as expected     implementationAlg.calculateres,relationshipAD      return 0  codepre  pI like this design because the algorithms are not generic classes, which makes it easy for the Generic Abstract Factory to produce them during runtime. p  pHowever, in Effective C there is an Item 36 saying never redefine an inherited nonvirtual function. I mean, nonvirtual functions are implementation invariant, they should not be overriden in general, but p  ol liThere are no virtual member function templates available in C. li liIf I make the Algorithm classes generic on RelationshipWithA and Algorithmcalculate a vritual member function, the Factory needs to know about the Realtionship in order to generate Algorithms, and the code gets seriously smelly to me at least.li ol  pIs this then a proper solution for the problem, even though I override inherited nonvirtual functions function templates p  pTo the client, there is no difference in behaviour what so ever the result is there, the only difference is in the way it is computed. This means that the IsA relationship is still upheld the Algorithmcalculate is still implementation invariant to the client. p

Negative 10851 pI am getting started with pthreads in C and I am also a maniac of writing my code as bugfree as I possibly can. p  pDespite trying to be extra careful, valgrind is telling me that I am leaking memory, regardless weatherp  ol liI create joinable threads that I join upon completion code snippet 1li liI create joinable threads that I detach after creation code snippet 2li liI create detached threads code snippet 3li ol  pI know this has already been discussed see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13132890leakingmemorywithpthreadsthisa, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11123823pthreadmemoryleakincprogrammingthisa and also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6412120detachedpthreadcreateleaksmemorythisa, but I am still curious as top  ol liWhy on certain runs I end up with no errorsli liWhy there seems to be a random number of overall mallocs when dealing with detached threads ltlt answer provided by nos, code snippet fixed with an added delay in the mainli liWhy do the memoryleak persist even when dealing with detached threads ltlt same as 2.li ol  pAs I understand from the previous answers and the valgrind trace, pthreadcreate is the root cause, extending the stack used by threads as necessary and reusing it at times, thus a few missing frees. But what is less clear is why it depends on the execution run and why it also happens when creating detached threads. As I have seen from certain answers, comments and also from the man, the resources from a detached thread will be freed upon thread completion. I have tried various tweaks to work around this added a sleep time before the end of each thread, before the end of the main thread, increased the stack size, add more work... but it didnt change the end result by much. Also, why is there a random number of overall mallocs when dealing with detached threads, does valgrind lose track of some of the detached threads This also does not seem to depend on the stack size.p  pThe provided code is a mock example of a managerworkers model for which a joinablejoin approach to thread management seems more suitable imho. p  pThanks for any enlightenment you might be able to provide I also hope these overcommented  snippets of code will be helpful anyone wishing to get started with pthreads. p  p swappyp  pPS Sys info gcc on debian 64bit archp  pstrongCode snippet 1strong

As a beginner, I like the cleanliness of implementing codePropertyChangedcode notifications  but since their is no inherent SelectedItem property to bind to on the codeTreeViewcode, I am unable to raise my PropertyChanged event as I normally would with codeListBoxcode.p  pI too have a SelectedItem property that actually successfully captures the object where isSelected  true on my ChildViewModel see H.B.s answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq71538131751090this questiona.

I cannot get them to sync up. p  pPlease help me understand how to communicate the codeSelectedItemcode property of my ChildViewModel to my ParentViewModel. I do not bind my TreeView to a codeCollectionViewcode, so I am unable to get the codeCurrentItemcode in the view collection.p  pMy viewmodel collections Im dealing with are very queryheavy, so Ive not included any code for now.

Negative 10851 pIm having trouble with a particular homework assignment of mine. It almost seems impossible. The question goes like this...p  pIn the future, you may work with other programming languages that do not have a type like decimal which supports precise monetary calculations. In those languages, you should perform such calculations using integers. Modify the application to use only integers to calculate the compound interest. Treat all monetary amounts as integral numbers of pennies. Then break the result into its dollars and cents portions by using the division and remainder operations, respectively. Insert a period between the dollars and the cents portions when you display the results.p  pWhen I follow the directions and use integers I get these overflow errors before I can even divide anything out.

It seems I dont understand some fundamental wxPython concept, here. What is going on and how do I fix itp  pIve seen that codeauicode seems to support docking, but documentation has been sparse so I havent attempted it. If someone could supply a minimal working code sample as to how to make a codeFramecode dock to another codeFramecode with codeauicode, I could also take that approach. p  pNote that Im also using codepygamecode and codetwistedcode in this app, which may or may not be interfering here... p

Negative 10851 pIve looked all over for an answer to this one, but nothing really seems to fit the bill.  Ive got very large files that Im trying to read with ATpy, and the data comes in the form of numpy arrays.  For smaller files the following code has been sufficientp  precodesat  atpy.Tablesatellitedata.tbl codepre  pFrom there I build up a number of variables that I have to manipulate later for plotting purposes.  Its lots of these kinds of operationsp  precodew1  np.array[sat[w1column]] w2  np.array[sat[w2column]] w3  np.array[sat[w3column]]  colorw1w2  w1  w2 just subtracting w2 values from w1 values for each element colorw1w3  w1  w3  codepre  petc. p  pBut for very large files the computer cant handle it.  I think all the data is getting stored in memory before parsing begins, and thats not feasible for 2GB files.  So, what can I use instead to handle these large filesp  pIve seen lots of posts where people are breaking up the data into chunks and using codeforcode loops to iterate over each line, but I dont think thats going to work for me here given the nature of these files, and the kinds of operations I need to do on these arrays.  I cant just do a single operation on every line of the file, because each line contains a number of parameters that are assigned to columns, and in some cases I need to do multiple operations with figures from a single column.  p  pHonestly I dont really understand everything going on behind the scenes with ATpy and numpy.  Im new to Python, so I appreciate answers that spell it out clearly i.e. not relying on lots of implicit coding knowledge.  There has to be a clean way of parsing this, but Im not finding it.  Thanks.p

Negative 10851 pIm having a little trouble understanding how to approach the following in order to unit test the class.p  pThe object under test is an object that consists out of 1 public method, one that accepts a list of objects of type A and returns an object B which is a binary stream. Due to the nature of the resulting binary stream, which gets large, it is not a nice comparison for the test output. The stream is built using several private instance helper methods.p  precodeclass Foo      private BinaryStream mBinaryStream     public Foo      public BinaryStream BarListltObjectgt objects           perform magic to build and return the binary stream          using several private instance helper methods.         Magicobjects         MoreMagicobjects          private void MagicListltObjectgt objects   work on mBinaryStream       private void MoreMagicListltObjectgt objects   work on mBinaryStream    codepre  pNow I know that I need to test the behaviour of the class, thus the Bar method. However, its undoable both space and time wise to do compare the output of the method with a predefined result. The number of variations is just too large and they are corner cases.p  pOne option to go for is to refactor these private helper methods into a separate classes that can be unit tested. The binary stream can then be chopped into smaller better testable chunks, but also here goes that a lot of cases need to be handled and comparing the binary result will defy the quick time of a unit test. It an option Id rather not go for.p  pAnother option is to create an interface that defines all these private methods in order to verify using mocking if these methods were called or not. This means however that these methods must have public visibility, which is also not nice. And verifying method invocations might be just enough to test for.p  pYet another option is to inherit from the class making the privates protected and try to test this way.p  pI have read most of the topics around such issue, but they seem to handle good testable results. This is different than from this challenge.p  pHow would you unit test such classp

Negative 10851 pI have a development server which runs mostly pythonbased apps.  I like the interface of tools like cloud9, but since I have a server Id rather have something similar on my own server. This is what I mean by selfhosting. I only need to edit local files ie, files on that server.p  pThe server is running Ubuntu server 12.04.  cloud9 is apparently available for selfhosting, but I have never used node.js and I dont want to learn about it if possible. I know that cloud 9 also offer ssh integration with other servers, but Im hoping to find a package I can easily install on Ubuntu and easily configure.p  pThere is a similar question on stackoverflow but from 2009.  p

Negative 10851 pNow I have one irritating problem. I have Site which includes many web apps on asp.net 2.0 classic app pool. My app works with the next steps  1 I recieve login form from server, input my credentials and send form.  2 When credentials are correct, my server starts to merge all configuration settings from mashine.config and web.config to one file ApplicationConfiguration.merged.xml which located in app root folder.  3 After that my app sends me page and I continue work with site. Thats all. But.. when I start my app first time after apppool recyclingafter time out or manual recycling I have refreshing my app immediately after writing ApplicationConfiguration.merged.xml. After that my session is expired and I login again and my app works correctly. ApplicationConfiguration.merged.xml locates in app root folder. When I switch off writing to this file or locate its to another folder for example temp folder in app root folder there all works correctly. IIS refresh my app with next event p  precodeApplicationEnd ChangeInGlobalAsax shutDownMessageOverwhelming Change Notification in Cinetpubwwwrootmyapprootfolder Overwhelming Change Notification in Cinetpubwwwrootmyapprootfolder Change in GLOBAL.ASAX HostingEnvironment initiated shutdown CONFIG change HostingEnvironment caused shutdown codepre  pSo as I understand IIS thinks that I have changed important configuration filesweb.config of Glabal.asax and refreshes my app. But I dont use this file for anything  I only write current configuration information here. And why doesnt IIS refresh app everytime when I am logging because I am writting file each time after succesfull login but IIS refresh my app only after firt start. Can I say IIS to ingnore ApplicationConfiguration.Merged.xml changes I believe you can help me to understand this curious IIS behaviour. Thanks for your help.p
Negative 10851 pI manage a site www.abc.com which already has a SSL certificate which is expiring in 2 weeks. So I created a .CSR from the existing .JKS file and sent it to the CA. I got back a .PEM and imported the pem file to the existing jks and deleted the old certificate in jks.p  pWhen I installed the new jks in web logic server 10.3.6 it threw exception saying the keystore does not have the private key. What would have caused this Deleting the old certificate using its alias would have deleted the private key as well Is there a way to check the validity of jks before installing it p  pRegards, Arunp
Negative 10851 pIm trying to do a simple speed test in Matlab. I want it to factor 3a2 for each a from 1 to 20. Might be Im choosing too small numbers here to see any significant difference, but Im stuck anyway.p  pI tried to writep  precoden  [120] m  3.n1 arrayfunfactor,m codepre  pthis gives a not enough input parameters error. I though it made sense but apparently not. After looking at some examples of arrayfun and the manual, i also triedp  precodearrayfunmfactorm, m arrayfunm, factorm, m arrayfunfactor, m codepre  pbut none worked. Whats the correct way to do it And also if I do speed tests of this sort, will the results be cached so I will have to use different numbers if I do the test againp

But Ive looked through other answers and have been trying to get this to work for a couple of days now with no luck.p  pIve added libraries to the libs folder and checked that theyre ticked in the order and export menu as all the other questions suggest.p  pHeres a minimal project that has the problem.

That is the ONLY difference between the TST amp VAL deployment.p  pDoes anyone have an idea what might be going wrong Could it be a server related issuep  pthx.p

Negative 10851 pI have a priority queue with synchronized access of tasks. Each task has a time at which it is to be performed. When the task at the front of the queue is due to be performed, it should be popped from the queue, but not before since something could be added ahead of it in the queue. i.e. with an earlier timestamp. Also the task could be removed from the Q before it is due to be performed.p  pThis much I think I have sudo codep  precodepublic synchronized task Q.get     while Q.empty         wait           queue is not empty     if Q.head.time.isBeforenow  task at head of Q is due to be done         return Q.pop     else          THIS IS WHERE IM STUCK       codepre  pAt the point ememp  pI could write code to sleep until the time of the task at the head of the queue, then take it. The problem here would be that we have a lock on the Q and so no tasks can be added while we sleep Also if something would be added though Im not sure it can at the head of the queue then the reader would sleep too long.p  pI also thought I could write code to wait on the Q again, but after setting a timer a separate thread owned by the queue purely to Q.notify at the time of the task at the head of the queue. The problem I see with this is that if something is placed at the head of the Q, wed interrupt the timer and notify on Q then the reader would take the new head task, without checking its time.p  pAny help would be really appreciated, thanks in advance. Im fairly inexperienced with this, so please correct any wrong assumptions etc.p  pEdit.  The reader class, simply loops, gets the next task by calling Q.get and actions it.p

Negative 10851 pWe using google closure as the build tool for a medium size javascript project. To make it easier to protect the code we turned on the ADVANCEDOPTIMIZATION option. The result were lots of codedangerous use of the global this objectcode warnings.p  pThere are several workarounds discussed like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5301373closurecompilerwarningdangeroususeoftheglobalthisobjectherea but I dont find them really satisfying. The first thing annoying me is to put everything in the global namespace. Isnt this a really bad architecture style from the old days of functional programming This means changes throughout the whole project whenever someting global changes...p  pThe other solution would be to use the constructor annotation throughout the code. This would change nearly every object method into a documented constructor we have more than thousand .... Before starting to annotate everything is it safe to use the annotation method e.g. is the code working after optimization Maybe the code is not obfuscated within the annotated methods p  pIs there really no better alternative as these two above p

Negative 10851 pI am building a database system that contains a number of columns with mathematical relations between them. For example this is a chess game storage example that I made up, one column is called numpawns, one is called numnights, one is called numcastles, and one is called piecescore. The values in piecescore are determined by the formula 1numpawns  3numknights  5numcastles. I would like to know how to set a rule that recalculates the value of piecescore whenever one of the other columns is updated. For example, in row 1 the respective values of the first three columns are 6, 2, 1 and a knight is removed 6, 1, 1, the value of piecescore should automatically update from 17 to 14 after the value in the numknights column is updated. I realize that it would probably be more efficient to do this in PHP or C, but I am designing my database model to be portable. It could be on a server with MySQL and PHP, or it could be on a mobile device with SQLite and Java. Is there any way to accomplish these kind of postquery updates using strictly SQLp  pstrongUpdatestrong br To clarify and elaborate on the above example, imagine two additional columns scorerank and skilllevel. The reason for the above computations is so that each row can be assigned a value in scorerank based on its score compared to the other rows highest score gets 1, second gets 2, etc.. After a rank is assigned, the top 5 scores are given a value of 1 in skilllevel, scores 610 are given a value of 2, 1115 are given 3, etc. Is this comparison and ordering possible in SQL Im guessing that a trigger is the proper approach, but how could I execute the ordering and assignments over the whole table after an UPDATE As I mentioned, this database needs to be portable and selfcontained, so ideally the sorting and ranking abstraction should be maintained inside the database. That way queries can be made based off of the scorerank column or skilllevel column with the assumption that these values reflect the current state of the table.p

Negative 10851 pAfter 20 hours and not getting an answer I think i have to simplify my problemp  pI have 104 files I put all of them in a single data frame. Each file has 6 columns. Column one can be divided into 50 groups. Each file has different number of records for each of these 50 groups. I only need to save 1000 records. I tried a nested for loop, but it doesnt work.  p  hr  pGood day everyone. I wonder if anyone could help an R programming novice. I have to sort a huge file contains 4911703 rowsobs. of 6 variables. p  pa hrefhttpwww.filedropper.com57 relnofollowKindly, you can download a brief scheme of this data frame herea p  pData frame has 6 columns V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6p  pIn this file, V1 has 50 different numbers called topics 451, 452, ..., 500 and V6 has 104 different systems name. each system in V6 has approximately 1000 records for each number topic in V1. e.g. 1000 records for 451, 1000 records for 452 and so on. I have to sort this data frame. I did that using codearrangecode in plyr package. Accordingly, one of its columns which is V4 rank got unsorted and i have to rerank the data by adding a new column called newrank. I used a nested for for this reranking.p  precodefori in 150    fori in 1     cleanfile[newRank] lt 01000   codepre  pproblem unfortunately, the systems records for each topic in V1 are not equal. one system may have 1045 records for 451 and another system may have 1345 records. So, i got a problem in the second for.  Since I just need 1000 records for each topic in V1, I tried to subset the data frame before rerank it. but I dont know how to do this In other words, I want to have just 1000 records for each topic in V1 for every 104 systems in V6 [104 x 1000 x 50]. I wonder if anyone could help me solving this. Thanks in advanced.p  pPS I read 104 files by list.files and ldplyfile, readt.table to make this huge file. I tried to read these 104 files in multiple data frames instead of one, but again I encountered a failure to do so.   p

I dont want it to open through Notepad or any other program.p  pThe best way I can explain this is look at all of your desktop icons. When you double click something it runs on its own. It doesnt need Notepad or whatever coding program you used to open up first. Now implementing that exact same concept to my question. I want to open the program I have coded in its own window.p  pI hope that makes sense. I dont want to show my code because its original.p  pEDIT The HTML code consists of CSS and JS.

Negative 10851 pIm making RadioPlayer with model, view and controller. Model would be a shared instance and all initialization play, pause etc., view is just button and slider and controller should merge view and model... p  pNow Ive got problem how to do this especially if using nibs...

But after it has returned information about a number of the PDUs, I got an error displayed in the console cant remember what it said now but I thought it may be because it was trying to capture a PDU when there wasnt one being sent.p  pI have tried amending my code to account for the occasion that a PDU may not be being received over the network at the time that it is trying to capture the information about the PDU by surrounding the code with the following try catch loopp  precodetry     socket  new MulticastSocketEspduSender.PORT     address  InetAddress.getByNameEspduSender.DEFAULTMULTICASTGROUP     socket.joinGroupaddress      whiletrue         byte buffer[]  new byte[MAXPDUSIZE]         packet  new DatagramPacketbuffer, buffer.length          socket.receivepacket          Pdu pdu  pduFactory.createPdupacket.getData          System.out.printGot PDU of type   pdu.getClass.getName         ifpdu instanceof EntityStatePdu             EntityID eid  EntityStatePdupdu.getEntityID             Vector3Double position  EntityStatePdupdu.getEntityLocation             System.out.print EID[  eid.getSite  ,   eid.getApplication  ,   eid.getEntity  ]              System.out.print Location in DIS coordinates [  position.getX  ,   position.getY  ,   position.getZ  ]                      System.out.println               catchException e     System.out.printlne     System.out.printlnThis is where the error is being generated  codepre  pHowever, when I now run the code it still displays the first x number of DIS packets it captures x varies every time I run the code, but then gives me a codejava.lang.NullPointerExceptioncode. As I understand, this will occur either because the PDU that the code has captured does not contain any information, i.e. an empty PDU, or because it is attempting to receive a PDU when there isnt one being sent over the network.p  pHow can I make the code skip the occasion that it doesnt receive a PDU, and just keep running Or is there something else I should do to get rid of this errorp

Thank you.p  pAlso i do realise that this might not be the best ways of using concurent Csharp and not the up to date one but this is what i have been assigned with and do not have any other options unfortunatley. Once again sorry and Thank you.p  pEDIT How i understand this is that i need to have 3 buffers and 3 semaphores for each pannel. But i do not know how to add those to each one of them and then connect it with the next one as if i try and add them it eather puts a cross in the design view over that panel or says that there is limited options for this statement. Thank you.p

Negative 10851 pIn my project it is required to implement codeIPseccode to packets programatically. Currently my system captures packets utilizing ncodeetfiltercode queue and readies the packet to be codemangledcode.

Negative 10851 pso I was fooling around with DNLIB recently, and I was trying to add methods to a .net file. I got the methods from a previously compiled file, so basically, I was trying to mimic the method. p  pThere are 3 methods GetTheTypes, InvokeIt, and InvokeCall.p  pFirstly, I had to create the methods GetTheTypes and InvokeIt because InvokeCall calls both the GetTheTypes method and the InvokeIt method. So I added those methods, and they were added perfectly. It compiled and saved, and I was able to see them in a reflectorILSpy with no problem. Note when I add the methods, I have a check to see if they should be static or nonstatic, so that is not an issue. They are also all public methods.p  pThen, I wanted to add the InvokeCall method. So I did the same thing I did for the other methods, opened the methods I wanted mimicked in ILSpy, then basically copied all of the instructions and local variables into a new CilBody which were added to the InvokeCall method that I was mimicking. The only problem was it threw an error saying strongError Calculating Max Stack Valuestrong. The weird thing was, if I changed the OPCode from Call to NewObj, it compiled fine. But that is not what I want to do. What I want to do throws the error mentioned above.p  pHere is the code I use to add the instructionp  precodecBody.Instructions.AddOpCodes.Call.ToInstructiongetTheTypesMethod codepre  pThe stronggetThetypesMethodstrong variable is defined as a strongMethodDefUserstrong and consists of the method I created ealier and compiled just fine. I have also tried thisp  precodecBody.Instructions.AddOpCodes.Call.ToInstructiont.Asm.ImportgetTheTypesMethod codepre  pThat also did not work. I have also tried to get the DeclaringType of the method as well, then Finding the method like thisp  precodecBody.Instructions.AddOpCodes.Call.ToInstructiont.Asm.ImportgetTheTypesMethod.GetDeclaringType.FindMethodGetTheTypes codepre  pThat didnt work either. p  pSo if anyone has any suggestions as to how to call a method that was just created, please tell me. Ive been trying to find out how to fix this problem for the last day or so, with no prevail. Thanks.p

Negative 10851 pThis time I have a logic question. Hope someone of you could help me. Using the NSSpeechSynthesizer you can set the rate, i.e. 235 words per minute, 100 words per minute and so on... p  pI found that generally the average of words per minute is calculated using standardized word length of 5 characters per word, counting spaces and symbols too.p  pI need to automatically subdivide a long text in tracks with a preselected duration, let say 15 minutes per track. p  pHow can we calculate the correct number of characters to pass for each split to the speech engine p  pMy solution is as followp  precode duration is the number of minutes per track numberOfWordsPerTrack  [rateSlider floatValue]  duration splits  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]  finished  NO NSUInteger position  0 while finished       NSRange range       the idea is I take 5numberOfWordsPerTrack characters      until the text allows me to select them       range  NSMakeRange position, 5numberOfWordsPerTrack      if range.locationrange.length gt mainTextView.string.length            If there are not another full character track we get          the tail of the remaining text          finished  YES         range  NSMakeRange position, mainTextView.string.lengthposition             Here we get the track and add it to the split list       if range.locationrange.length lt mainTextView.string.length           currentSplit  [mainTextView.string substringWithRangerange]         [splits addObjectcurrentSplit]           position  range.length  codepre  pThe problem with this solution is that the track duration is not correct. It is not quite far from the desired value, but it is not right. For example, using 235 words per minute with duration of 50 minutes, I have 40 minutes per track. If I set 120 minutes per track, I have 1h39m per track... and so on...p  pWhere do you think is the logic errorp  pstrongemEDIT AFTER JanX2 REPLYemstrongp  pWell, while randomly thinking I came to the following hypotesis Could you tell me what do you think about that before its implementation, because it is not a light change in my codep  pIf I used the codespeechSynthesizerwillSpeakWordofStringcode delegate member I could test the .aiff file size frequently, i.e. before speaking the next word real word, not standardized. Because we know the Hzs, bits and channels those file are created with by synthesizer and because we know they are not compressed, we could gain some guess about the current length of the track. p  pThe biggest drawback of this solution could be che continuous disk access, that can highly degrade performance.p  pWhat do you thinkp

Negative 10851 pQt problem p  pI am sending a signal from object A which is running on thread A to object B which is  running on thread B.  I am also handling custom events by overing virtual event function in Object B.p  pProblem facing When object A is emitting any signal , corresponding slot in Object B is not getting invoked instead of that event function which is overridden by object B is getting called.So how to extract arguments send by signal from QEvent object received by event function of Object B or how to defer that event so that corresponding slot gets called. p  pObject A is running in gui thread and its responsibilty is to update the gui . Object B is implementing gui logic and running in different thread . Object A is notifying gui changes through signals and slots to object B . Object B is also handling events coming from one more thread which is not a QThread . I am using custom events for that and using postEvent function for that to notify Object B . Object B has overriden event function for receiving custom events. Now the problem is that when i am sending any signal from object A to object B to notify about  gui related changes , it is getting caught by event function and the corresponding slot is not getting invokedp

Negative 10851 pI am building an Access Database application in MS Access 2007 which is essentially a tool for data collection which I will need to distribute to various sites to be filled out.  After the sites fill out all the necessary records, they will return the tool and I will need to merge all the data from the various sites into a single database for analysis.  I have 2 tables and 3 forms with a bunch of custom VBA code behind for data validation, cleaning and flow.  p  pI have a Summary form that shows all the records currently entered.  Users can then Add a record using a button on the Summary form which launches a data entry form lets call it Data Entry Form 1.  From Data Entry Form 1, there is another form that can be launched Data Entry Form 2 for entering child records about the record being filled out on Data Entry Form 1.  There is referential integrity enforced at the table level.p  pThe flow from the Summary Form to Data Entry Form 1 and Data Entry Form 2 is important for the integrity of the data.  I have dictated this flow explicitly in VBA and will instruct users to always begin at the Summary Form.  p  pAfter that lengthy background, my question.....p  pWhat are my different options, and the relative advantagesdisadvantages for the options for deploying this application to my various sites.  My basic requirements arep  ul liIdeally users would never see the tables in which the data is being stored in.li liThe Summary form would launch when opened and they could not open any other form directly.  li liClosing the Summary form would close the application.li liSince there is a bunch of VBA code dictating important functionality, if they did not accept the Security Warning, they would not be able to access any of the forms or use the toolli liI can easily script the extractionexport of the data from the two tables for each toolli ul  pI am vaguely aware of the following options  Distribute the full ACCDB file to the sites  Create and distribute an AACDE file to the sites  Use the Access Developer Extensions to package the application  create and EXE filep  pI have also read that if users do not have Access 2007 or later, that they can download the MS Access Runtime Services and be able to use my application without having to buyinstall a full version of MS Access.  Can someone confirm this Does this apply to all of the above ACCDB, ACCDE, EXE Is there any functionality that would not be available to them from a strictly data entry rolep  pThanksp

Negative 10851 pIve been working on a project for my Java class. In this project, we create a simple TicTacToe game with a pretty GUI, all of that is swell, I made it work just fine. I ran into my problem when I got to checking if one of the two players has won. p  pThe game is 2 player, no AI, as of right now but that wouldnt really impact the algorithm needed to check if the player is a winner or not. The variable that makes it difficult for me is that the board size can be changed from 3x3 to 4x4 to 5x5  1,000x1,000 and beyond. I need a way to check if the player won regardless of the board size. p  pThe 2 algorithms I could think of arep  precodeAlgorithm 1   1. Go through every row HORIZONTALLY, add 1 to an integer if its an x, 1 to a different integer if its an o, and then check the next slot, if it is the same as the previous, add another point, if it is null or the opposite, reset the points to 0, and restart, continuing in place down the row.  2. Go through every row VERTICALLY, do the same method of points .  3. Go through every DIAGONAL going down to the LEFT, same method of points .   4. Go through every DIAGONAL going down to the RIGHT, same method of points .   The Diagonal Methods here would have to exclude the corner pieces so we dont get an OOB error. codepre  blockquote precodePros Less coding Easier to code  Cons Does more computer than Algorithm 2 Not as smart What happens if board size is 1,000,000 gt So many more computations to complete... codepre blockquote  precodeAlgorithm 2   This algorithm would take the spot you just played and...  1.

Negative 10851 pI thought program counter is a part of hardware. Im confused after reading the following. Can someone clarfiy the differencep  blockquote   pA singlethreaded process has one program counter specifying the next   instruction to execute. Threads are covered in Chapter   4. The execution of such a process must be sequential. The CPU executes one instruction of the process after another, until the   process completes. Further, at any time, one instruction at most is   executed on behalf of the process. Thus, although two processes may be   associated with the same program, they are nevertheless considered two   separate execution sequences.

Negative 10851 pIve come across a medical provider website that serves its pages over aspx.  This provider has new client forms within this same aspx page.  I contacted the vendor that built the website asking why they arent using https.  They assured me they are using https encryption within the iframes.p  pMy question Is this response total BSp  pIt seems to me that a very simple way to hack this website would be to spoof the site using my own aspx page that redirects over to me.  Without https, the browser has no idea of the security, so nobody would be able to tell if they were on my website or the actual one.p  pThis is all HIPAA protected info in the US thats transmitted, so there are laws about how it must be protected.  It seems that the contractor is being pretty negligent, but maybe Im missing something.p  pFYI, Im not posting the website on purpose because I dont want to invite hacking something I think is insecure.p

Negative 10851 pApologies for the confusing title, I couldnt find a clearer way to express my question. Im trying to use stdfunctions for implementing callbacks.

Negative 10851 pI dont know if this situation is possible or not, and I dont know what should I do to achieve my needs. I have a class called A. In class A I have 02 methods m1 and m2 and 01 thread. The thread will be responsible for listening to a socket connection for any incoming message. If a message arrives, the thread will call m1 method to process the message. The thread is started when the class is instanced.p  pbrThen I have method m2, which is responsible for sending message to the socket the same socket that the thread is listening to. Every time the method m2 sends a message to the socket, there will be a response message from the socket. I didnt implement the code as listening to the socket right after a message is sent because the socket may sometime also send random messages. p  pbrMy question is, is there any possible way, when my method m2 sends a message, it will wait until method m1  invoked by the thread  finished before exitingp  pbrThank you very much.p

Negative 10851 pIve inherited a project that is massive in scale, and a bit of a labyrinth. The traffic is substantial enough to want to optimize the data access, so Ive began converting some WCF services that are invoked by javascript to Web API. p  pUnfortunately, the databases primary keys not auto incrementing are also managed by a custom ORM by querying a MySQL function that returns the next set of IDs to be used. The ORM then caches them and serves them up to the application. The database itself is an ever growing 2 TBs of data, which would make downtime significant.p  pI had planned on using Dapper as Ive enjoyed easeperformance in the past, but weening this database off of this custom ORM seems daunting and prone to error. p  pQuestionsp  ul liDoes anyone have any advice for tackling a large scale projectli liShould I focus more on migrating the database into an entirely new data structure it needs significant normalization, tooli ul

Negative 10851 pId be extremely grateful for any suggestions on how to fix this for Ive run out of ideas.p  pWhen trying to open a form to a subset of records, using the filter function of the form on a date field in the table, I noticed that some records are consistently missing. For example, I have 8 records with a certain date in my table, but if I filter for that date, only 6 of them are returned. p  pThe table field is formatted as DateTime, Short date. I checked for leading or trailing spaces and inconsistent use of zeros, but found nothing.  The records were imported from Excel files, where the field in question was also formatted as DateTime. The date field is part of the composite primary key for the table together with one other field. I removed and redid the primary key in case this was an faulty index issue but it didnt help. I deleted the date for one of the records and reentered it manually but it didnt fix the issue for that record. I did the Compact and Repair with no success. Ive looked at a sample of about 40 records and I cant find anything that distinguishes the ones that are returned by the filter from the ones that get lost, not even which Excel file they were originally imported from.p  pIf I use a select query instead of the form filter, I get the complete subset. I could use a query in the background to do what I need to do, but Id prefer to fix the underlying problem if possible. p  pThanks for readingp

These addresses are in the codegfncodeguest physical frame number form. I wanted to tell if these codegfnscode were mapped in kernel or userspace.

Negative 10851 pI try to use Dynamic Time Warping DTW to detect gestures performed with a smartphone by using the accelerometer sensor. I already implemented a simple DTWalgorithm.p  pSo basicly I am comparing arrays of accelerometerdata x,y,z with DTW. The one array contains my predefiend gesture, the other should contain the measured values. My problem is, that the accelerometersensor measures continously new values and I dont know when to start the comparison with my predefined valuesequence. p  pI would need to know when the gesture starts and when it ends, but this might be different with different gestures. In my case all supported gestures start and end at the same point, but as far as I know I cant calculate the traveled distance from acceleration reliably.p  pSo to sum things up How would you determine the right time to compare my arrays using DTWp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 10851 pComments on a hrefhttpsgist.github.comshadowhand873637 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comshadowhand873637a statep  pECB mode encryption is a relatively simple method of encryption that provides a high level of obfuscation or a low level of encryption. This method is not very secure and should not be used for sensitive personal data, but would work well for eg. transmitting source code between private parties in a public channel. For better security, you can switch the mode to CBC at the cost of having every file change completely for every modification. As with all encryption, a strong key is always recommended.p  pandp  pThis is kind of part of the definition of functionally correct encryption  ECB click here for an explanation is a flawed legacy implementation recommended by precisely nobody for current use today, and only supported in OpenSSL because OpenSSL supports some very old and creaky legacy crypto implementations Its only useful today as a learning tool and should never be used in current systems.p  pCBC of OFB modes should be the default  please consider changing your gist to use CBC and explain the potential benefits of ECB along with the downsides for those who would like to accept the loss in security for slight convenience in git.

And if I allow any number of handlers to be attached, I end up driving pointless traffic to Facebook.p  plooking for some guidance on what the best way to achieve this is. I want to minimize the number of openActiveSessionWithReadPermissions handlers while retaining the ability to invoke it as allowLoginUINO and allowLoginUIYES based on the users actionsp

Negative 10851 pI have diagnosed the problem of using ngshow when using an asynchronous call, specifically using google javascript client libraries  gapi. p  pI have this in my partialshtml pages in my angular app. I will use ngshow as follows. This is where I call the ngshowp  precodeltdiv ngshowisRegisteredgtltdivgt codepre  pWhen running my battery of tests, ngshow strongDOES NOTstrong go into an endless loop when I simply do a return call of some boolean value. For examplep  precodescope.isRegistered  function   scope.test  false return scope.test codepre  pFurthermore, there is strongNO endless loopstrong when I go into another function and toggle scope.test to true or false indefinitely with say, a simple check box.p  pThe problem of this endless loop begins as soon as my return is dependent on some type of asynchronous call like thisp  precode    scope.isRegistered  function         scope.testfalse        var joe  function         var deferred  q.defer       gapi       .client       .conference       .isRegistered       .executefunction res          scope.applyfunction             if res.error              log.errorThere was an Error             deferred.rejectres.error                      else              log.infoSuccess             deferred.resolveres.data                                  return deferred.promise             joe       .thenfunction data          log.infoGot some data, data         log.infotesting         scope.test  data         log.infoscope.test             log.infoscope.test     return scope.test   codepre  pIt keeps on outputting the following in an endless loopp  ol liSuccess li liGot some data true lt Boolean Value of trueli litesting li litrue ltBoolean Value of trueli lifalse lt Boolean Value of falseli ol  pI suspect though, printing false at the end, it does not return false it does not return anything.p  pWhen I switch ngshow to nginit like thisp  precodeltdiv nginitisRegisteredgtltdivgt codepre  pI get the output strongwithoutstrong an endless loopp  ol lifalseli liSuccessli liGot some data trueli litestingli litrueli ol  pSo with an nginit, it appears it returns the scope.test global to true  hence it terminating. With ngshow, due to the nature of the async gapi calls, and maybe just the nature of ngshow, though I ask for a return value, it never returns anything. I do not know why.p  pHowever, I am confused because the joe function body  the async gapi call appears to be successfully called asynchronously, but the isRegistered function body never knows that it is done  hence this loop. p  pHow can I got about letting isRegisteredngshow know that the async gapi call is done and return either true or false, and NOT constantly stay in this state of an endless loop. It appears to me, from the way I have it coded, it never returns anything. How do I make it so that isRegistered would return either true or false based upon the return of the async gapi callp

Negative 10851 pHow do you solve the problem when some of the keyvalues pairs in your code.insertcode statement are optional and thus your keyvalue pairs change all the time while its being executed within a loop Im reading hundreds of rows from a tablep  pAs I only have only 6 mandatory fields in the collection and 6 optional fields Im not sure how I can elegantly code it so that I dont have to insert the empty values as well into my collection. With 6 optional fields I have roughly if my math is correct 36 different combinations that I have to handle in if clauses, not really practical. Thats a dilemma the schemaless MongoDB creates unless I want to waste space and have many keyvalue pairs with empty values in my document.p  pIve tried using a string that is concatenated with the keyvalue pairs as a parameter. Which isnt allowed in the code.insertcode command codesyntax errorcode as meteor expects a code key1value1, key2value2 code structure.p  pI could enter all keyvalue pairs at once and then fire up to 6 codeunsetcode to delete those fields again from the document but that isnt really a practical solution as it will create a lot of IO operations when there really should only be 1 IO operation.p  pAny suggestions How do you solve the problem with changeable key value pairs in Meteor Thanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 10851 pI am using ASP.NET page with updatepanels and Jquery UI tabs. However, Im having a problem with it.

Negative 10851 pIm in the process of learning and designing an app for our company. At its heart, it has a list of alarms which when clicked on, goes to a more detailed view with a toolbar to perform tasks upon that alarm.p  pIm having a devil of a time working out how to structure this application. I have something that works currently ill explain it in a sec, but now Im about to hook up the data source for the table and Im getting myself lost.p  pAt the main screen, there is to be a list of alarms. This list should be able to be filtered with 3 categories All, Category 1, Category 2 where the categories are subsets of all the alarms. Ive implemented this using a TabBarController.p  pWithin each tab, Ive got a NavigationController to handle the navigation of between the list and the details and its main view is a custom UITableViewController that contains the custom table view.p  pAs described, when you click a item, it navigates to a detailed view. This is all currently working but Im concerned about the structure.p  pIts pretty obvious that I have a fair bit of duplication with the 3 different NavigationControllers, but Ive read that subclassing the NavigationController is not recommened.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipIs there a better way to structure this application Is there a better filtering method thats quick and easy instead of a TabBarpli lipWhere should the tableview datasource go Most examples Ive seen have it being created in the AppDelegate and then passed directly to the tableviewcontroller. My custom tabelviewcontroller is a couple of levels down the controller chain, how do I pass the datasource to it, or can I make the datasource staticpli ol  pI hope that all made sensep

One day Foobar accidentally navigates to the editor registration page registrations controller, new action. p  pSince Foobar is already an Editor, I should redirect him to his profile page.

Negative 10851 pWhy do we need boostthreadspecificptr, or in other words what can we not easily do without it p  pI can see why pthread provides pthreadgetspecific etc. These functions are useful for cleaning up after dead threads, and handy to call from Cstyle functions the obvious alternative being to pass a pointer everywhere that points to some memory allocated before the thread was created.p  pIn contrast, the constructor of boostthread takes a callable class by value, and everything nonstatic in that class becomes thread local once it is copied. I cannot see why I would want to use boostthreadspecificptr in preference to a class member any more than I would want to use a global variable in OOP code.p  pDo I horribly misunderstand anything A very brief example would help, please.

May be this case is simple, but Ive faced this decision many times sometimes not knowing what is best.p  pAlso, lets say I want to add a comment, should I add it to the comment collection the entity has and the have the entity merged, or should I have a codeaddCommentLong userId, Comment newCommentcode methodp  pIm looking for advice or best practices regarding this. If you need further clarifications please do not hesitate to ask.p  pEDITp  pIve found the comments so far helpful, however notice this, it isnt really about users and comments, I just made that up to explain my situation. Its about whether it is convenient to mix both approaches which I think is not or is one better over the other. I liked the always persist through the repositories suggestion. But the fact that I have a codefetchCommentscode repository method and the codegetCommentscode in the user entity creates to entry points for the same functionality, so how do I deal with that. Also the performance 1 query vs 2 queries isnt really important because I will be fetching the user entity too so its not like Im actually saving anything.p

Negative 10851 pOk, so my question is kind of convoluted, so Ill try to be as clear as possible.  Because a collection of radio buttons does not have a SelectedItemValue property, I have collected my radioButtons into a ListBox, based on some XAML I found online.  Now, in order to save space on the UI, that ListBox is taking over the content of a ComboBox popup.  So when you click the comboBox, what drops down is a list of radiobuttons in a WrapPanel.  I have been able to successfully bind the RadioButton listbox control by itself to an itemssource and bind selected value to a property, but once inside the combo box, I cannot seem to get the selected value binding to work properly, ItemsSource still works fine.p  precodeltStyle xKeyRadioButtonList TargetTypexType ListBoxgt     ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueWhitegt     ltSetter PropertyItemsPanelgt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt                 ltWrapPanel BackgroundTransparent gt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt     ltSetter PropertyItemContainerStylegt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltStyle TargetTypexType ListBoxItem gt                 ltSetter PropertyMargin Value5 gt                 ltSetter PropertyTemplategt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                         ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType ListBoxItemgt                             ltBorder BorderThickness1 BackgroundTransparentgt                                 ltRadioButton FocusableFalse Width120                                         IsHitTestVisibleFalse                                         ContentBinding Name                                         IsCheckedTemplateBinding IsSelectedgt                                 ltRadioButtongt                             ltBordergt                         ltControlTemplategt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltSettergt             ltStylegt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt     ltSetter PropertyControl.Templategt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType ListBoxgt                 ltBorder BorderThickness0 Padding0 BorderBrushTransparent BackgroundTransparent NameBd SnapsToDevicePixelsTruegt                     ltItemsPresenter SnapsToDevicePixelsTemplateBinding UIElement.SnapsToDevicePixels gt                 ltBordergt             ltControlTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt ltStylegt ltStyle xKeyRadioButtonCombo TargetTypeComboBoxgt     ltSetter PropertyTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltControlTemplate TargetTypeComboBoxgt                 ltGridgt                     ltToggleButton                              NameToggleButton                             DataContextTemplateBinding ItemsSource                             ContentBinding ElementNameDropDownContent, PathSelectedItem.Name                             Focusablefalse                             IsCheckedBinding PathIsDropDownOpen,ModeTwoWay,RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent                             ClickModePress gt                     ltContentPresenter                             NameContentSite                             IsHitTestVisibleFalse                               ContentTemplateTemplateBinding SelectionBoxItemTemplate                             ContentTemplateSelectorTemplateBinding ItemTemplateSelector                             Margin3,3,23,3                             VerticalAlignmentCenter                             HorizontalAlignmentLeft gt                     ltPopup NamePopup PlacementBottom IsOpenTemplateBinding IsDropDownOpen                             AllowsTransparencyTrue FocusableFalse PopupAnimationSlidegt                         ltGrid NameDropDown SnapsToDevicePixelsTrue                               MinWidthTemplateBinding ActualWidth MaxHeightTemplateBinding MaxDropDownHeightgt                             ltBorder xNameDropDownBorder BackgroundWhiteSmoke                                     BorderThickness1 BorderBrushBlackgt                             ltListBox NameDropDownContent StyleStaticResource RadioButtonList                                       WidthTemplateBinding MaxWidth                                      SelectedValueBinding PathSelectedValue, RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent                                      ItemsSourceTemplateBinding ItemsSourcegt                             ltListBoxgt                         ltGridgt                     ltPopupgt                 ltGridgt             ltControlTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt     ltStyle.Triggersgt     ltStyle.Triggersgt ltStylegt codepre  pMy use of that looks like thisp  precode    ltComboBox NameSourceComboCtl                TextSource                SelectedValuePathCodeId                DisplayMemberPathName                SelectedValueBinding PathSourceCode               StyleStaticResource RadioButtonCombo               Width60                MaxWidth150 gt codepre

Negative 10851 pCSS specification states that lineheight should be applied to text by dividing the specified value by two and applying the result above and below a line of text. p  pThis varies significantly from the traditional understanding of leading, which usually means that spacing is added only above the line of text.

The problem is that when that view model is later passed as a parameter by the framework into an action method, those property values has not become automagically repopulated, so if you need to redisplay the form because of validation errors, you need to repopulate those options again.p  pOne potential solution, which I am asking for specifically in this question, is how to make the MVC framework instantiate the view model with constructor injection, which would provide the view model constructor with an implementation of some kind of data access object e.g. a repository that can be used for retrieving the options when they are requested by the view e.g. in the helper method DropDownListFor p  pI think the solution might have something to do with implementations of IModelBinderProvider or IModelBinder but after having experimented with these things from example code snippets here and there on the net, I am still looking for a completely working example, with downloadable executable code without any missing piece of how putting all things together.p  pIf you are looking for some alternative discussion about how to populate a select list, e.g. with  Dependecy Lookup instead of Dependecy Injection you may want to check out the following discussion Best way to populate SelectList for ViewModel on GETPOST a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7603519bestwaytopopulateselectlistforviewmodelongetpostBest way to populate SelectList for ViewModel on GETPOSTap  pSome days ago I wrote the following followupquestion in that thread about the Dependecy Injection I am now looking for in this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8674525310457httpstackoverflow.coma8674525310457a which provides a code example about the problem I am looking for a solution ofp  pBut instead of hoping that someone will find that old thread with a less specific title, I have created this new question with a more specific subject about what I am looking for. And I will also provide a link from that thread into this new question for anyone that want to followup regarding this specific solution I am looking for.p

For this dynamic list, Id like to do it in xaml.p  pThe somewhat ugly solution would be to store all the ComboBox objects as they load... then I can call ScrollToHorizontalOffset directly, but Id really prefer to do it a cleaner way than that  EDIT Actually, this may not be reasonable. A quick look at trying to hack around this issue gets into some really awkward situations trying to map my datasource items to the controlsp  pIve tried HorizontalContentAlignment, that only impacts the droppeddown portion of the ComboBox.p  pIve also tried to hook other various loading events, but havent found one that works.p

Adapter focuses on resolving incompatibilities between two existing   interfaces. It doesnt focus on how those interfaces are implemented,   nor does it consider how they might evolve independently. Its a way   of making two independently designed classes work together without   reimplementing one or the other. Bridge, on the other hand, bridges an   abstraction and its potentially numerous implementations. It   provides a stable interface to clients even as it lets you vary the   classes that implement it. It also accommodates new implementations as   the system evolves.p blockquote  pI dont fully understand the above statement, p  ol liDoes it mean that if I vary the adaptee or change the implementation of the original interface at design time then it is strongBridge Patternstrongli liThe differences sounds trivial, Is there any other differences in implementationabstcationli liHow can anyone tell what implementation is used strongafterstrong developmentli liCan anyone give me a good example of bridge pattern and how it can be changed during software lifecycleli ol  pUpdatep  pAgain from GoFp  blockquote   pRemember that an adapter makes two existing interfaces work together   as opposed to defining an entirely new one.p blockquote  pDoes it mean that changing the existing interface so that it can work with another interface is an implementation of strongAdapterstrongp  pUpdate2p  pJust found this incredible article a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles3151IllustratedGOFDesignPatternsinCPartIIStrucIllustrated GOF Design Patterns in Cap  pThis is true Bridge Patter structurep  pI was missing the fact that the Bridge pattern lets you combine the different abstractions and implementations and strongextendstrong them independently img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu3pkn.gif altenter image description herep

Negative 10851 pI was playing with codeptrdifftcode and reading the C11 standard when I came across this issue. First, the factsp  pThe type codeptrdifftcode just an example is pulled from the Standard C library header codeltstddef.hgtcode into codeltcstddefgtcode 18.22. Section 17.6.1.2 tells us that declarations pulled from the C standard library will be within the codestdcode namespacep  blockquote   pIn the C standard library, however, the declarations except for names which are defined as macros in C are within namespace scope 3.3.6 of the namespace codestdcode. It is   unspecified whether these names are first declared within the global namespace scope and are then injected into namespace codestdcode by explicit emusingdeclarationsem 7.3.3.p blockquote  pAs it also says, the declarations may have been declared in global namespace first and then injected into codestdcode. So it would make sense, for my implementation, that the following compiles just finep  precodeinclude ltcstddefgt  int mainint argc, const char argv[]    stdptrdifft x   ptrdifft y   return 0  codepre  pMy implementation gcc 4.6.3 must have declared codeptrdifftcode in the global namespace and then injected it into codestdcode. However, if I compile the following code, I get an error notice the codeltiostreamgtcode includep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  int mainint argc, const char argv[]    stdptrdifft x   ptrdifft y   return 0  codepre  blockquote   pmain.cpp In function int mainint, const charbr   main.cpp63 error ptrdifft was not declared in this scopebr   main.cpp63 note suggested alternativesbr   usrincludec4.6i686linuxgnu.bitscconfig.h15628 note   stdptrdifftp blockquote  pSo, since codestdptrdifftcode is available, codeltiostreamgtcode must be including codeltcstddefgtcode in some way although its not required to. But why is the global version not also available as it  was before Can I not expect this injection to be consistent even when its actually the same header This seems like odd behaviour. Whether the injection occurs may be unspecified, but it should at least be either one way or the other, not both, rightp

Negative 10851 pOkay, Im going out on a limb here, because Im not sure this functionality exists, but if it doesnt, it probably should.

And were talking a HUGE codebase here  tens of thousands of files in almost 300 projects.  Couldnt even begin to guess at lines of code  20003000 per file is not uncommon, so this is real needlehaystack territory.  I know that this data contains a specific identifiable string.  Id like to be able to set a breakpoint for when stronganystrong chunk of memory is set to that string.p  pWhat I dont knowp  pI have no idea where or even if this string is being stored anywhere, so I cant set a breakpoint on a memory address or a variable.  All I know is that for at least a brief period of time perhaps no more than the scope of one function, or even just one iteration of a for loop, this value exists emsomewhereem.  Its possible the string itself is ignored by the code and only the accompanying data is stored, but the string must exist in memory at some point.p  pI obviously cant set a regular breakpoint, because if I knew where to put that breakpoint, Id already have what I need and thered be no need to resort to such measures.

Negative 10851 pI have an application that requires Windows authentication with fallback to Forms authentication. I built it in this way a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms972958.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms972958.aspxa and everything works fine. p  pSo basically I create forms authentication cookie for a domain based on the outcome of Windows authentication. The cookie is valid as long as the browser stays open. I do not have problems with that in Firefox or Chrome, not even IE8 on Windows XP machines. Unfortunately all Windows7 machines with IE8 experience the same problem a login prompt shows up when you try to refresh the page after around 30minutes of inactivity. Even if I provide valid Windows credentials I still cannot log in to the application. Nothing helps, but closing the browser and starting it again. Then I am again logged in automatically and it will be fine as long as I stay active. After 30 minutes of inactivity  again log in prompt. After some research I found out that if I delete the auth cookie using developer tools F12 and then refresh, I get automatically logged in without the prompt just what you would expect from Windows authentication.p  pDoes anyone of you have an idea what can go wrong and how can I get it to work correctly on Windows7 machines Or maybe ideas on where to look Is it IIS problem I use IIS6 on Windows 2003 Server, client problem What makes Win7 IE8 so special that it failsp

Negative 10851 pOk I have been working on a class to iterate through all nodes in an html doc and return the data that I need. This is very simple and I have achieved this in Bash but now I am trying to port the same to C. p  pI started with the example on the libxml site but I have stepped through this function node by node and I cant understand how it is working.p  pHere is the functionp  precode    static void printelementnamesxmlNode  anode      xmlNode curnode  NULL      for curnode  anode curnode curnode  curnodegtnext          if curnodegttype  XMLELEMENTNODE              printfnode type Element, name sn, curnodegtname                   printelementnamescurnodegtchildren       codepre  pSo basically, this function takes a node assigns it to a pointer, and starts to loop through all sibling nodes, but if the current node has children, it calls the function and start over on that child node. This is all very understandable. p  pSo it drives down the doc structure, but how does it navigate back up the structure p  pDoes xmlNodechildren return the next parent node when it is found NULL As far as I can tell, this is not true, but I just cant figure out how this is working.p  pI successfully created a class to do what I want, but it is so much more complex than this and about 10 lines longer. I actually had to check if the next node was null and either navigate down if it has children or navigate back up and to the next node if it didnt. p  pThis example is much simpler and I would like to understand how to make my code better.p

Negative 10851 pAre other replacement strategies planned regarding the maximum size eviction I would need an MRU algorithm, such that the system benefits from the cache. The system stores records in blocks on disk or in cached pages inmemory, whereas the pagesrecords are not clustered that is probably not stored in preorder after updates. The records in my case are nodes in a treestructure. p  pThe system assigns recordIDs in ascending order that is at first they are in preorder and also stores the records in pages with an incremented ID 0, 1, 2.... After updates however, if the recordsnodes for instance need to be traversed in preorder it might be that a page is read with records 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... but nodes have been inserted between node 6 and 7 for instance node 11 with a large subtree. In this case the cache is only useful if it preserves the first page which stores records 1,2...,10 if the cache size is 1 and the subtree rooted at node 11 belongs to another page. Then the first page must be fetched twice. Its similarly the case for other treetraversal methods, that MRU is more useful than LRU, but maybe other clever algorithms exist which might be even better suited. Would probably be an aspect of selftuning.p  pSorry for the long description of my use case a versioned data storage system, but I hope its a valid use case. Thus it would be nice if the sizebased eviction would be configurable as in some cases probably also LRU perfectly makes sense however probably not for treetraversals.p  pEdit I probably dont even need concurrency support as long as Im only allowing one writetransaction at a time because Guava splits the entries into different segments, such that its not using a global LRU algorithm.p
Negative 10851 pI have a custom container that I have been using for many years without issues. Recently I found out that if I define iterators for my container, I can effectively use all of the algorithms defined in codeltalgorithmgtcode. Not only that, it seems that a hrefhttpthrust.github.iothrust librarya  basically think CUDA version of STL for Nvidia GPUs heavily uses iterators and I am hoping that by using them Ill be able to use that library as well.p  pAnyway, since this is my first try at writing my own iterators, I thought I post what I have here to ask for further assistance and make sure what Im doing is right. So, I wrote a little array class that supports both codeiteratorcode and codeconstiteratorcode classes. I ran my class with a bunch of different STL algorithms and all seem to work fine but that does not necessarily mean Ive got everything right In particular, is there any operator that I miss for my iterators  Have I defined extra unnecessary ones Also, since most of codeiteratorcode and codeconstiteratorcode look similar, is there a way to prevent duplicationp  pIm open to suggestions and

Negative 10851 h3The situation and the goalh3  pImagine a user search system that provides a proximity search from a users own position, which is specified by a decimal latitudelongitude combination. An Atlanta residents position, for instance, would be represented by code33.756944,84.390278code and a perimeter search by this user should yield other users in his area from a radius of 10thinspmi, 50thinspmi, and so on.p  pA tablevalued function calculates distances and provides users accordingly, ordered by ascending distance to the user that started the search. Its always a live query, and its a tough and frequent one. Now, we want to built some sort of caching to reduce load.p  h3On the way to solutionsh3  pSo far, all users were grouped by the integer portion of their latlong. The idea is to create cache files with all users from a grid square, so accessing the relevant cache file would be easy. If a grid square contains more users than a cache file should, the square is quartered or further divided into eight pieces and so on. To fully utilize a square and its cache file, multiple overlaying squares are contemplated. One deficiency of this approach is that gridding and quartering high density metropolitan areas and spacious countrysides into overlaying cache files may not be optimal.p  pReading on, I stumbled upon topics like nearest neighbor searches, the Manhattan distance and treeesque space partitioning techniques like a kd tree, a quadtree or binary space partitioning. Also, SQL Server provides its own geographical datatypes and functions though Id guess the puremathematical codeFLOATcode way has an adequate performance. And of course, the crux is making usercentric proximity searches cacheable.p  h3Questionh3  pI havent found much resources on this, but Im sure Im not the first one with this plan. Remember, its not about the search, but about caching.p  ul liCan I scrap my approach img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgHmQd.gif altli liAre there ways of an advantageous partitioning of users into geographical divisions of equal sizeli liIs there a best practice for storing spatial user information for efficient proximity searchesli liWhat do you think of the techniques mentioned above quadtrees, etc. and how would you pair them with cachingli liDo you know an example of successfully caching userspecific proximity searchli ul

Negative 10851 pThe site I am designing dramatically changes size for me when I open it in Chrome as opposed to Firefox and Internet Explorer.

Ive also made sure that all the browsers Im using are showing at 100 so I know its not a zoomed inout issue.p  pThis is a somewhat unrelated note and you dont need to answer this, but the site loads a little bigger on Firefox than my design perimeters were in Photoshop, so there is a tiny but that makes it too high and a scrollbar appears. Im thinking of reworking the code so itll resize for peoples viewports properly since Ive now learned that there really isnt a standard height. Im not sure where to start with this, I guess I should use percentages If anyone knows a good tutorial or a site with information to get me started making a flexible layout, that would be much appreciatedp

So somewhere in the code I dont know in an application I dont know for most part a rest call on my api will be triggered.

Password may be hashed.

They supply you with a sample application, which I was able to use successfully, both on device and simulator.p  pI then started building out my app. I imported the SudzC generated files into a new XCode project using the blank application template with CoreData and ARC enabled.p  pI got the first SOAP request up and running  everything works in the simulator  and then I went to do my first test on a device iPhone 5S running iOS 7.02. The device throws an codeEXCBADACCESScode error every time the SOAP request is run.p  pIve tracked this down to the codeSoapRequest.mcode file, specifically the codeconnectionDidFinishLoadingcode method. This method uses a codeobjcmsgSendcode call to send the SOAP response data back to a handler method in another class in this case, my view controller. Heres the codep  pstrongSoapRequest.mstrongp  precode voidconnectionDidFinishLoadingNSURLConnection connection      NSError error     ifself.logging  YES          NSString response  [[NSString alloc] initWithData self.receivedData encoding NSUTF8StringEncoding]         NSLog, response           CXMLDocument doc  [[CXMLDocument alloc] initWithData self.receivedData options 0 error amperror]     ifdoc  nil          [self handleErrorerror]         return           id output  nil     SoapFault fault  [SoapFault faultWithXMLDocument doc]      if[fault hasFault]          ifself.action  nil              [self handleFault fault]          else              ifself.handler  nil ampamp [self.handler respondsToSelector self.action]                  objcmsgSendself.handler, self.action, fault              else                  NSLogSOAP Fault , fault                            else          CXMLNode element  [[Soap getNode [doc rootElement] withName Body] childAtIndex0]         ifdeserializeTo  nil              output  [Soap deserializeelement]          else              if[deserializeTo respondsToSelector selectorinitWithNode]                  element  [element childAtIndex0]                 output  [deserializeTo initWithNode element]              else                  NSString value  [[[element childAtIndex0] childAtIndex0] stringValue]                 output  [Soap convert value toType deserializeTo]                               ifself.action  nil  self.action  selectoronload          ifself.handler  nil ampamp [self.handler respondsToSelector self.action]              objcmsgSendself.handler, self.action, output          else ifself.defaultHandler  nil ampamp [self.defaultHandler respondsToSelectorselectoronload]              [self.defaultHandler onloadoutput]                    conn  nil  codepre  pSo the line codeobjcmsgSendself.handler, self.action, outputcode seems to be where my issue is. codeself.handlercode is pointing to my View Controller, and codeself.actioncode points to this methodp  pstrongTasksViewController.mstrongp  precode void findItemHandler id value        Handle errors     if[value isKindOfClass[NSError class]]          NSLog, value         return            Handle faults     if[value isKindOfClass[SoapFault class]]          NSLog, value         return            Do something with the id result     NSLogFindItem returned the value , value  codepre  pThe reentry to this method is where I crash out.

I also tried the same thing with the instance of SoapRequest...Now, I was able to work around the issue by creating a property in the view controller and setting that property to the value, but I am really curious how to fix this using the original code. I went back to the example app I downloaded from SudzC to see how that was working, and it turns out ARC is not enabled for that project .p  pCan someone tell mep  p1 If I am correct in my assumption that codeoutputcode is being deallocated, causing the handler method to reference a bad memory addressp  p2 Why this works on the simulator I assume it is because the sim has a lot more memory available so it isnt as aggressive with ARC deallocations...p  p3 How I could fix this, assuming I want to keep the codeobjcmsgSendcode call I want to learn howwhy this is happeningp  p4 If SudzC is correct in their usage here of codeobjcmsgSendcode, as I understand it is bad practice to call this directly except in rare circumstancesp  pThanksp

Negative 10851 pI am currently using scrapy to pull the 52 week highs list off of barcharts.org. I then take that data, remove all the extra stuff, and then save it to a txt file. I then take the txt file and use it to pull EPS rating data off of investors.com website. With that I clean it up and save it to another txt file.p  pNow I have two txt files and want to merge them for further analysis. The way I was looking to merge it was to have two columns.

Negative 10851 pI have a situation in which I have a model having 5 fields with getter and setters, say strongid, name, age, dob, citystrongp  pA service class contains a method which is bound to return only specific fields data in form of an array. Like I want only name and age of all people.p  precodeListltObjectgt getEmpDataAsListListltObjectgt fields codepre  pSo my method look like this which expects one parameter codefieldscode which contains list of fields that are needed to be returned. So for this case, I should send just codenamecode and codeagecode to fields parameter and my codegetEmpDataAsListcode detects fields asked for and build a return array accordingly.p  pI was wondering what is the best way of doing it. Should I pass codefieldscode List  as String which I am also doing at present, likep  precodeListltStringgt fields  new ArrayListltgt fields.addname fields.addage  getEmpDataAsListfields codepre  pBut I think, this is not safe. What if I plan to change name of a field one day or what if I remove a field from model, then I need to make changes at 3 places. Should I make an enum in model class and use enum fields to create this same codefieldscode array and use it Or is there any other better way of doing thisp

Negative 10851 pSo in my Rails 4.0 app, Im using Devise for my authentication management and Ive noticed that I get a 500 error when I try to log out of an expired session.  Im not sure where the problem is located though.  I see a number of different potential sourcesp  p1 I dont completely understand how the authenticity token is validated, but my understanding is that it comes from something in the session store.  In this case, my session store is configured as follows   p  pconfiginitializerssessionstore.rbp  precodeMyAppApplication.config.sessionstore ActionDispatchSessionCacheStore, expireafter gt 20.minutes codepre  pWhen I log out and receive this error, the 20 minutes has passed, so my session should be expired in the cache.  I dont want to increase this number though just to be able to log out of my session.  That doesnt seem to make much sense.p  p2 The other possibility is in the config for Devise. Im using the default settings for the Devise Timeoutable module, show below.   p  pemconfiginitializersdevise.rbemp  precode gt Configuration for timeoutable  The time you want to timeout the user session without activity. After this  time the user will be asked for credentials again. Default is 30 minutes. config.timeoutin  30.minutes   If true, expires auth token on session timeout. config.expireauthtokenontimeout  false codepre  pI would assume that Devise would be smart enough to check if the token is already expired and just pass me through if yes.  Otherwise, its trying to destroy a nil session, which again doesnt make any sense.p  p3 The final possibility is in the Devise session controller itself.  Perhaps I need to put something likep  precodeskipbeforefilter verifyauthenticitytoken, only gt [destroy] codepre  pI would assume that would work, but it feels like a hack to me given that Devise is such a well used gem and I cant be the only person who is doing this.  If I need to do this, I would assume Im doing something else wrong.p  pHas any one else run into this issue  Ive only encountered this problem since upgrading to Rails 4.0 Running Devise 3.2.2.  I didnt have this problem with Rails 3.2 Running Devise  3.1.0.p  pIm mostly just trying to avoid my users seeing a Server 500 error when they try to log out of an unattended session and Im looking for the proper way to handle it. Any ideasp

Negative 10851 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm writing a Google Maps web app API v3 and I want the user to be able to print what they see on screen.p  pThe map div is 100 wide and 100 high with various bits and bobs overlayed including the markers and application controls etc.p  pIm using a print set of css rules to remove the bits I dont want to print and all that is working perfectly.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pThe problem I am having is that the map is far too wide for the page and actually a bit too high as well. with size set to Shrink To Fit in the print set up.p  pIm using Firefox mainly for the development, but testing in Chrome and IE and am seeing the same thing.p  pIf I have a full screen browser window on my 1920x1080 monitor the pint preview and print output is only about 50 of what is shown on screen.p  pIf I reduce the print size in the Print Preview dialog to 50 things look about right.p  pIf I reduce my browser window to about half its horizontal size and by just a little bit vertically then things look just about right.p  pSo, the problem seems to be browser window size dependent  ie the browser window is showing more map than can be printed.p  pEssentially what Im trying to achieve is having the all of the displayed map print as tall and as wide as possible dependent on the users printer settings  a true Shrink To Fit if you like. But I cant seem to get anywhere with this.p  pstrongSolutions Ive triedstrongp  pOne solution thats been suggested in other threads is to generate a fixedsize popup window of a suitable size for the print  this is what I previously did in my API v2 application Im rewriting from scratch for v3  but this isnt working either. With the popup I only get the smaller viewport displayed  ie roughly the same portion of the map as would be printed I guess this confirms that my window size is about right.p  pIm generating the popup with the followingp  precodevar content  window.document.getElementByIdmapcanvas  get you map details var logoBox  ltdiv classlogoBox idlogoBox stylewidth300px    height65px borderradius4px backgroundcolorrgba255,255,255,0.75    boxshadow5px 5px 2px rgba50,50,50,0.5  floatleft zindex10 positionabsolute  top10px   left10px padding5pxgtltimg srcmyLogo300x65.png idmyLogogtltdivgt var printWindow  window.open,printWindow, Width640, Height620,locationno,menu barno,resizableno,scrollbarsno,statusno,titlebarno,toolbarno  open a new window printWindow.document.writecontent.innerHTML  write the map into the new window printWindow.document.writelogoBox  printWindow.print  print the new window codepre  pTheres another oddity with this as well  on mobile the popup map displays with the same markers set displayed as the main calling page, but on FireFox on the desktop it opens up with just one of my markers.p  pstrongIdeasstrongp  pIm thinking the solution might be something to do with one or more of the followingp  ul lithe print css forcing a proper scale to fit, or  liplacing a printable element in the bottom right of the map in case the browser is seeing the map tiles as not important enough to scale to, or lineeding to do a getBounds on the bigger map and setting those on the smaller map to zoom the map appropriately. ul  pRe the final point here, Ive tried to get my head around this but am struggling with calling a fitBounds in the new popup window from the main window.p  pSo far Ive gotp  precodevar displayedMapBounds  new google.maps.LatLngBounds displayedMapBounds  map.getBounds  map is the Google Maps instance on the main page  printWindow.map.fitBoundsdisplayedMapBounds  This doesnt work for semiobvious reasons printWindow.document.map.fitBoundsdisplayedMapBounds  This doesnt work for semiobvious reasons codepre  pThis is inserted in the above code after the dowcument.write statements.p  pIm sure those semiobvious reasons are actually obvious to most, but is there a way to reference the map object and manipulate it from the main window like thisp  pAny pointers gratefully received as this is the showstopper for the relaunch of the site.p
Negative 10851 pIm developing an app in Ruby. It started as a small commandline utility but its now getting quite big, with basically three different apps A commandline util, a Sinatra web server and another server exposing a RESTful web API, all three relying on a database for doing various different things with the same data.p  pFollowing a hrefhttpyehudakatz.com20101216clarifyingtherolesofthegemspecandgemfile relnofollowthis great articlea by Yehuda Katz, Im managing all my dependencies with bundler, and have my Gemfile.lock committed into source control. I rely on many third party dependencies, and for some I do care about specific versions because of known issues.p  pNow, all three parts of the app are using some common infrastructure code mainly a Data Access Layer used to communicate with a database, and one or two other common classes. But other than that they can be considered separate apps. If this were some other language, like Java, Id probably split it into three applications, and put the common DAL code in a classlibrary referenced by all three.p  pIn Ruby, I know that gems should be used to package code libraries. So I was thinking about creating three gems for the apps and fourth gem with the common library code. Or maybe three nongem apps, all relying on a common gem.p  pThe thing is, Im not sure how to manage thirdparty dependencies that way. In the aforementioned article, YK states that for gem development the Gemfile.lock should strongnotstrong be added to source control. In my case, I do need specific versions of some of the thirdparty gems Im using, and the Gemfile.lock has been very important during an initial deployment recently. Also, I dont intend on publishing these gems, as its not an open source project. I just need a nice clean way to manage my dependencies, both thirdparty gems and internal.p  pSo...p  ul liShould I create four different gemsli liShould I just split it into three apps, all relying on one common gem Ill createli liWhat about the Gemfile.lock In which of these would it be wise to keep it in source control, and whyli liIs there some downside or advantage developing something as a gem vs just a plain app, if its not intended to be publishedli ul  pI would love to hear some suggestions and opinions from seasoned Rubyists about how to do this...p  pThanks.p

Negative 10851 pWe are currently in the process of updating our projectSpring MVC application which was based on Lucene 2.8, to ElasticSearch so basically the bottleneck of storing indexes will pass to ElasticSearch.p  pThe application now will only call ElasticSearch Server for CRUD operations on indexes, will not carry dependencies and responsibilities for managing Lucene Documents, IndexWriter... basically just Json  and will also show the results from search queries.p  pMy question is Will we needor gain advantage by using the Java API ElasticSearch offers instead of the Rest API because as far as I understandElasticSearch noob here Java API will only add more codeand maven dependencies in the application instead of just performing the REST calls since everything will be json now.p

Negative 10851 pI have a winforms userinterface that has a preferred size.  If the size of its parent form is below the panels codePreferredSizecode, then scrollbars are automatically displayed because the codeAutoScrollcode property is set to true.  If the size of its parent form is increased, then the panel fills the additional space, and the scrollbars are hidden.  Simple enough.p  pThe problem is that even when the form is larger than the codePreferredSizecode, decreasing the size of the form will briefly show the scrollbars, even though they are unnecessary.p  pThe following simple example reproduces the problem.  As the form is made smaller, the scrollbars will randomly appear even though the preferred size limit hasnt been met.

Negative 10851 pI have a client program CL that uses HTTPHTTPS to connect to a HTTP server HS, and uses DigestMD5 authentication to authenticate the client.  HS can use an internal database we are storing the A1 hash or it can use an LDAP server to check the credentials.p  pWith Active Directory AD Server 2008 R2 as the LDAP server, I get an error, Result 8009030C LdapErr DSID0C0904DC, comment AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, v1db1.  On the AD there is a Windows Event Log under the Directory Service item which basically says the same thing.p  pNow, there are plenty of scenarios which are working just fine, using a simple username like joe and a realm that is the domain name like CONTOSO 1. If the HTTP server validates the digest using its own the stored hash  2. If the HTTP server receives the clear text password from the client via a Form, and does an LDAP Simple bind against the AD 3. If the HTTP server receives the clear text password from the client via a Form, and does an LDAP SASL DigestMD5 bind against the AD 4. If I run a Java program to do the LDAP bind using DIGESTMD5 this is basically a minimal version of the same thing as 3 5. If I use ldp.exe on the AD, choose DIGESTMD5, and choose the bind command Obviously, since these work, the password is correct.p  pI think the problem might be something to do with the servicename attribute, which is sent by the client in the digest response.  In cases 3,4,and 5, the servicename attribute is something like ldapads.example.com.   But in the failure case, because the servicename is sent by the client, servicenameHTTPHTTPSERVERNAME.  p  pId appreciate any pointers on how to configure the AD so it will accept an HTTP authentication via SASL DigestMD5 it seems like it should be possible to make it work but it is just not clear why it is not working for me.p
Negative 10851 pPossible similar question  p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2755056sqlinterruptingaquerySQL Interrupting a queryap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3912417isthereawaytoabortansqlitecall39125253912525Is there a way to abort an SQLite callap  pHi everyone, I am actually using socket.io and sqlite3 modules to perform SELECT query on a SQLite database. When a user click on an OpenLayers Map, its sends a signal to the server through socket.io to gather informations by performing spatial request like intersection, union... using Spatialite extension and then finally send back data to the client these are longrunning queries depending of the amount of geometries  to show a popup on the map where the user clicked to.p  pThe problem is if a user click many times on the map, sending many requests to the server,  only the last one is important. Imagine that if a query takes 5 sec to be executed, and that a user click 3 times in a second on the map he just wants the last location where he clicked to be used, then the server will do 3 queries, sending back 3 signals through socket.io and opening 3 popup, we just need the last one to be opened  Is there any solution to killabort a running sqlite query with nodejs p  pExample code p  precodesocket.onaskForInfo, function data      sendInfosocket, data.latitude, data.longitude  codepre  psendInfo definition  p  precodefunction sendInfosocket, lat, lng       Database connection     var db  new sqlite.Databasesome file.sqlite, sqlite.OPENREADONLY       Load Spatialite extension     db.loadExtensionmodspatialite, functionerr           Query doing spatial request         db.getVERY LONG SQL QUERY, functionerr, row               Send the data gathered from database             socket.emitsendData, row[some sql column]                codepre  pI want to do something like  p  precodeif sendInfo didnt finished to emit any signal through socket     AND user did another resquest  then     kill all running sendInfo function execution and sql query codepre  pI know that if there are many users connected this wont work like that I may need to use session to know for which user the function is actually gathering data. But I dont find any solution even if there is only one user.p  pI tryed using AJAXjquery instead of socket.io. I can abort the xhr request, but the SQL query is still running even if the request is aborted until she is finish  using lot of ressources uselessly p  pThanks in advance for your answer.p

Negative 10851 pI am working on a webapp based on google app engine. The application uses the google authentication apis.  Basically every handler extends from this BaseHandler and as first operation of any getpost the checkAuth is executed. p  precodeclass BaseHandlerwebapp2.RequestHandler googleUser  None userId  None def checkAuthself     user  users.getcurrentuser     self.googleUser  user     if user         self.userId  user.userid         userKeyndb.KeyPROJECTNAME, rootParent, Utente, self.userId         dbuser  MyUser.queryMyUser.keyuserKey.getkeysonlyTrue         if dbuser             pass         else             self.redirect     else         self.redirect codepre  pThe idea is that it redirects to  if no user is logged in via Google OR if there is not a User in my db of users having that google id. p  pThe problem is that I can succesfully log in my web app and make operations. Then, from gmail, o Logout from any google account BUT if i try to keep using the web app it works.  This means the users.getcurrentuser still returns a valid user valid but actually OLD.  Is that possiblep  pstrongIMPORTANT UPDATEstrong I Do Understand what explained in the Alex Martellis Comment There is a cookie which keeps the former GAE authentication valid.  The problem is that the same web app also exploits the Google Api Client Library for Python a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarypython relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarypythona to perform operations on Drive and Calendar. In GAE apps such library can be easily used through decorators implementing the whole OAuth2 Flow a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarypythonguidegoogleappengine relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarypythonguidegoogleappenginea. p  pI therefore have my Handlers getpost methods decorated with oauthrequired like thisp  precodeclass SomeHandlerBaseHandler     DECORATOR.oauthrequired     def getself         superSomeHandler,self.checkAuth         uid  self.googleUser.userid         http  DECORATOR.http         service  buildcalendar, v3         calendarlist  service.calendarList.listpageTokenpagetoken.executehttphttp codepre  pWhere decorator is p  precode   from oauth2client.appengine import OAuth2Decorator     DECORATOR  OAuth2Decorator   clientidXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com,   clientsecretYYYYYYY,   scopehttpswww.googleapis.comauthcalendar httpswww.googleapis.comauthdrive httpswww.googleapis.comauthdrive.appdata httpswww.googleapis.comauthdrive.file           codepre  pIt usually works fine.  However   when the app is idle for a long time it happens that the oauth2 decorator redirects me to the Google authentication page where, if I change account I have 2 different accounts Something WEIRD happens  The app is still logged as the former account retrieved through users.getcurrentuser while the api client library, and thus the oauth2 decorator, returns data drive, calendar, etc. belonging to the second account. p  pWhich is REALLY not appropriate. p  pFollowing the example above SomeHandler class suppose I am logged as Account A. The users.getcurrentuser always returns A as expected. Now suppose I stopped using the app, after a long while the oauthrequired redirects me to the Google Account page. I therefore decide or make a mistake to log is as Account B. When accessing the Get method of the SomeHandler class the userId retrived through users.getcurrentuser is A while the list of calendars returned through the service object Google Api client Library is the list of calendars belonging to B the actual currently logged user.p  pAm I doing something wrong is Something expectedp  pstrongAnother Updatestrongp  pthis is after the Martellis Answer.  I have updated the handlers like thisp  precodeclass SomeHandlerBaseHandler     DECORATOR.oauthaware     def getself         if DECORATOR.hascredentials             superSomeHandler,self.checkAuth             uid  self.googleUser.userid             try                http  DECORATOR.http                service  buildcalendar, v3                calendarlist  service.calendarList.listpageTokenpagetoken.executehttphttp             except AccessTokenRefreshError, appengine.InvalidXsrfTokenError                 self.redirectusers.createlogouturl                     DECORATOR.authorizeurl         else            self.redirectusers.createlogouturl               DECORATOR.authorizeurl codepre  pso basically I now use oauthaware and, in case of none credentials I logout the user and redirect it to the DECORATOR.authorizeurlp  pI have noticed that after a period of inactivity, the handler raises AccessTokenRefreshError and appengine.InvalidXsrfTokenError exceptions but the hascredentials method returns True. I catch them and again redirect the flow to the logout and authorizeurlp  pIt seems to work and seems to be robust to accounts switch.  Is it a reasonable solution or am I not considering some aspects of the issuep

Its compiled by xCode 6.p  pKeychain dumper with a cannot see the data saved by this project, even though it persists and restores correctly. Even when the app is running, I cannot see the keychain data.  It also cannot share the keychain data from the other apps even though I use the same bundle seed etc, and follow the same recipe I always did.  Its writing in a different location or something.p  pHave the defaults for saving keychain data changed somehowp

Negative 10851 pIm using Foundation to create a website with a form. To keep things simple, Im also using Abide to validate the form with JavaScript.p  pEverything works great, including file attachment validation based on file type. Unfortunately, there doesnt seem to be a way to validate an attached file based on its size.p  pI am of course able to use jQuery to get the file size and Ive created an if statement based on the file size. If the file size is greater than 3MB, it displays an alert. That works.p  pIf in that same place as the alert I were to put in the code that Abide manipulates when input validation fails, I should be able to adapt Abide to validate based on an attached files type AND size.p  pIm hoping someone out there can enlighten me as to just which classesattributes are addedremoved when a form input fails validation. I know the small classerror HTML becomes visible, but Im not sure what the class is called that makes it visible, for example. Im also not sure what Abide does to disable the Submit button.p
