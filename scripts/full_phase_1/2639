Positive 2639 pIm trying to design a dash board in WX form builder for Python. Im having trouble trying to figure out how to keep two horizontal sizers that are children to a vertical sizer from expanding far apart from each other. Below is a screen shot describing what I am referring top  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comb6q0h.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comb6q0h.png altenter image description hereap  pemThe blue arrow represents that I want the textbox control and the label to move up closer to the first label.emp  pMy first instinct is that is had something to do with the wx.EXPAND etc flags however, I was not able to change those in a manner that made the sizers come closer to each other. Its almost like every time I place a sizer it automatically tries to fit everything in the entire window...which makes it difficult to place items in precise locations on the form. emAny suggestions on how to stop sizers from expanding to the entire frame window sizeemp  pMy next course of action was to try and use a gridsizer or a flex grid sizer however, Ive only used them through direct code, where you can select the exact location in the grid where you want to add a widget or object. With form builder, Im finding that they are more difficult to use mainly because I cant insert objects at certain indices in the grid sizer. It inserts them sequentiallyp  blockquote   p1,1  1,2  1,3  1,i  2,1  2,2  2,3  2,i  j,ip blockquote  pWhich means that if I need to change something in the grid...Its very difficult. emIs there something Im missing that makes it easier to insert objects into the grid, other than sequentiallyemp  pBelow is one of example of 5x5 grid sizer not completely filled where I have specified both the horizontal and vertical gaps  0p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comB1Ifj.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comB1Ifj.png altenter image description herea a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.combLiPE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combLiPE.png altenter image description hereap  pBesides being able to replace the button with a textbox at 1,4, I notice that the horizontal gap is clearly not zero even though I specified 0 for vertical and horizontal gaps.

Positive 2639 pIm using wxPython to build some GUI...

Positive 2639 pI have a wx.Frame with a Combobox. When a selection is made in the Combobox, a specific function is called.p  pI am having an undesirable effect with the ComboBox. While the ComboBox has focus, any movement of the mouse wheel changes the selection and, in consequence, a different function is triggered.p  pIn practice it is very difficult to remember you have to put the widget out of focus to save your original selection, so that, as the functions triggered take each several seconds to complete, usability of the GUI is not good.p  pI tried to catch the mouse event to no avail usingp  blockquote   pself.Bindwx.EVTMOUSEWHEEL, self.donothing, self.mycomboboxp blockquote  pWhich would be the best procedure to prevent mouse signals to affect the combobox p  pemEDITbr If you want to play with code, here is some you can execute and test.

Positive 2639 pI want to create a matplot that will change its size as I change the size of the app window. Ive tried to approach it by binding the EVTSIZE to a function like thisp  precode        binding to events         self.Bindwx.EVTSIZE, self.onSize ... def onSizeself, event         print self.GetClientSize         self.noisePanel.changeSizeself.GetClientSize .... def changeSizeself, x, y             frameSize  np.divide[x,y], self.frame.MYDPI             self.figure.setsizeinchesframeSize, forwardTrue codepre  pAnd I see that its going into the function. However, its not updating. I have the sizes but the figure itself is not changing. p  pIve tried p  ul liUsing frame.Updateli liUsing plt.show, which opens up a NEW app window where I CAN change the size of the plot, but I want it in the original window.li liUsing app.closeli liPutting in forward  True. This didnt help even though its from the documentation optional kwarg forwardTrue will cause the canvas size to be automatically updated e.g., you can resize the figure window from the shellli ul  pIn addition, if I bind my EVTSIZE to a function, the other GUIs do not rescale according to window size, which is frustrating.

Now, maybe youre not meant to copy them straight in, but one error I got was no module named wx. I learned that I could get that module by installing wxPython. Problem is, Ive tried all 4 options and none of them have worked for me. Which one do I download and how do I set it upp  pThanks,p  pOisin p
Positive 2639 pIn a wxPython application I have an embedded a FigureCanvas with a matplotlib figure. I want to be able to switch the figure by loading a new one. However, the figure is not being updated. p  pAnswers to similar topics suggests that codepanel.canvas.drawcode and codepanel.Refreshcode should do the trick, but Ive also tried codepanel.Updatecode and codepanel.canvas.Refreshcode.

Positive 2639 pAm using the wx.grid, wx.aui to build the UI as shown in the attachment,  Using gridlibaui.png. The intention is to let the user configure parameters P1P2P3... over different use cases U1U2U3... using comparator LEGEEQ etc, and corresponding values Value11, Value22 etc. This is all working fine. The grid lets me use a drop down for the comparator column so that the user can pick one of the choices for the comparator, instead of having to type it. Now when using a grid, the grid will become very unwieldy when there are 50 uses cases and 50 parameters for each use case. I want to use the gizmos.TreeListCtrl, so I can hide the nodes as required. I have attached the Wantthis.png which I got by modifying the example for TreeListCtrl.py. I do not see how I can modify this so that the comparator column can be a dropdown. The cttype allows only text, check boxes and radio buttons. I have tried looking through the documentation for the TreeListCtrl, but was not able to figure out if this could be done, and was hoping to find an answer here.

Positive 2639 pI am creating a wizard dialog with several pages using wxPython. I am having trouble laying out the controls because the size of each page is at least as big as the biggest wizard page. E.g. if my wizard has three pages, and page three has more controlswidgets than the other two, then page two and three have a lot of extra space because the wizard calculates its size based on page 3 as its the biggest. Pages one and two look really sloppy.p  pI read this in the documentation of the wizard class, which leads me to believe that its not possible to have a custom page size for each wizard pagep  blockquote   pThe wizard is laid out using sizers and the page area sizer is the   placeholder for the pages. All pages are resized before being shown   to match the wizard page area.p      pPage area sizer has a minimal size that is the maximum of several   values. First, all pages or other objects added to the sizer.   Second, all pages reachable by repeatedly applying WizardPage.GetNext   to any page inserted into the sizer.p      pThird, the minimal size specified using SetPageSize and FitToPage .   Fourth, the total wizard height may be increased to accommodate the   bitmap height. Fifth and finally, wizards are never smaller than some   builtin minimal size to avoid wizards that are too small.p      pThe caller can use Sizer.SetMinSize to enlarge it beyond the minimal   size. If RESIZEBORDER was passed to constructor, user can resize   wizard and consequently the page area but not make it smaller than   the minimal size.p      pIt is recommended to add the first page to the page area sizer. For   simple wizards, this will enlarge the wizard to fit the biggest page.p      pFor nonlinear wizards, the first page of every separate chain should   be added. Callerspecified size can be accomplished using   Sizer.SetMinSize . Adding pages to the page area sizer affects the   default border width around page area that can be altered with   SetBorder .p blockquote  pDoes anybody have a solution or workaround that will allow my wizard pages to be sized only according to what is on the current pagep

Positive 2639 pHi Im new to python and have started developing a GUI using wxpython. I just want to know the basic threading operation in wxpython. I have a main process which has OK amp Cancel Buttons and a child process derived from main with the OK and Cancel Buttons. I want to implement threading such a way that clicking OK button on main process must send a message to child process and child process must look for if any of its process is running, if so, it has to wait for that process to finish and then receive the message from main process.Similarly the same with the Cancel button in the main process. Basically i want to see how child process receives message from main process and both work parallel. Im trying with wx.CallAfter and wx.PostEvent and im confused with the threading concept here. Please someone help me. Thanks in advancep

In eventual use, it will be much more complicated, the idea is that I should be able to run pretty much anything, hence the codeBindDataTextBox1.Textcodep  pUPDATE The reason for connecting to many databases from the ASP.NET code rather than a stored proc on one or all dbs, or replicating to one db, is twofold.  Firstly, the dbs in question are frequently updated replicas of several similar production environments typically development, testing and support for each client, so anything done to the actual dbs would have to be updated or redone regularly as they are reloaded anyway.  Secondly, I dont know in advance what kind of query might be run, this form lets me just type e.g. codeselect count name from dbuserscode against a dozen databases without having to first think about replicating the dbusers table to a master db.p
Negative 2639 h1Why are circular references in Visual Studio a bad practiceh1  pFirst, I will describe an example of how this can happen using C in Visual Studio, since VS will typically inform you if you have a circular reference and prevent it.p  pFirst, a strongUtilitiesstrong class is created relying only on the code given to you by Visual Studio and .Net. Then, an strongEmailstrong class is created that depends on strongUtilitiesstrong. Instead of adding both projects to a single solution, a new solution is created and a reference to emUtilities.dllem is added. Then, some time later, someone decides that they want the strongUtilitiesstrong class to send an email and adds a reference to emEmail.dllem. Visual Studio is perfectly happy to let you do this, but now the source wont compile asis without one of the binaries.p  pAt my place of work it is standard procedure to copyandpaste binaries when doing development and then only building the projects youre working on. This has led to at least one circular reference in the codebase that has gone unnoticed for over 3 years.p  pThis seems like a very bad practice to me because there is no way to build either project from source without having the DLLs first. That argument falls a little flat to the practical people I work with since it seems highly unlikely that we will lose all copies of our binaries simultaneously. The binaries arent stored in version control at any point, which only makes me more worried.p  pThis seems like a situation that should be avoided, but not a situation that poses any appreciable threat. strongAre circular references between projects really a big deal or am I blowing it out of proportionstrongp

Negative 2639 pIve created a custom WPF control that performs some animations on dynamically created objects. I use SetTargetName to set animation target. I know about SetTarget but I need to support .NET 3.5 without SP1. Obviously before that I need to register object names with RegisterName. Everything works fine when my control is placed normally as an object in a window or page.p  pBut when I add my control to a DataTemplate I get a NullReferenceException on a call to RegisterName.p  pThe top of stack trace looks like thisp  blockquote   pat System.Windows.TemplateNameScope.System.Windows.Markup.INameScope.RegisterNameString name, Object scopedElementbr    at System.Windows.FrameworkElement.RegisterNameString name, Object scopedElementp blockquote  pBoth of the parameters I pass to RegisterName are not null and the object on which I call it isnt null. So something else must be null internally and I have no idea what to do about it. Theres no information on TemplateNameScope anywhere either.p  pAny pointers are highly appreciated.p

Negative 2639 pOne thing I have noticed a lot of back and forth on is where using statements should be placed in a C code file whether its in the outermost scope or inside a namespace. I understand that the location of the using statement affects the scope of the references within that file, but what I dont understand is why, in most cases, someone would ever want their using statements inside their namespace.p  pIn emalmost all casesem only one namespace declaration ever exists in a single file so scoping the using statements seemsis useless. If one were placing multiple types and multiple namespaces in the same file then scoped using statements make perfect sense, yet I still see plenty of cases of this being done even in files with one namespace.

Negative 2639 pI try to develop a file transfer application in Java, with an applet as client, and a standalone java app as server on a dedicated machine hosted in a datacenter. I use DataOutputStreamDataInputStream to transfers the data on both sides. When I send big volumes of data, the bandwith is very variable  all is okay first, then the tcp stream is freezed during 4050 seconds while nothing is transferring, and then it starts again.p  pWhen I look at the tcp stream with Ethereal, I see duplicate acks, fast retransmits, and tcp retransmits. But I dont think that the problem is originating from Java  I have the same problem with FTP transfers in FileZilla. But ... when I try to transfer data using netcat netcat client  netcat server, all is fine, the bandwith is stable, the tcp lost packets seems to be retransmitted immediately without any pause, no matter of the volume transferred.p  pIts like if Java was not as talented as netcat to play with tcp streams ...p  pI tried to play with Socket.setSendBufferSize, but I didnt see any difference.

Negative 2639 pIf I have an algorithm that takes n log n steps e.g. heapsort, where the steps take log n time e.g. comparisonexchange of big integers in the range 0 to n1, what is the asymptotic bound for the whole process.p  pObviously we can say n log n log n, but Im having a hard time trying to convince myself that I cannot simplify this to n log n. At the same time, Im having a hard time justifying the instinct that insists that I can.p  pIs my instinct just plain wrong on thisp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIt seems my simpleexampletoavoidcomplicatingtheissue has complicated the issue. Oh well.p  pThe real reason for the question is that I often have a standard algorithm with a known complexity, but implemented using different underlying containers, so that the individual steps are Olog n rather than O1. For example, Hopcrofts automaton minimisation algorithm is On log n  but if you start using binary tree containers for the states, transitions and intermediate results, the steps themselves become Olog n  the On log n is no longer valid because the assumption of O1 accesses is invalid.p  pStill, people will claim that there are n states and m transitions, but n and m tend to be linearly related for automata, assuming that the number of transition annotations is constant and that the automata are moreorless deterministic.p  pI havent worried too much about this in the past  the cases I work with arent very big. But, well, Im doing a major refactoring of my automata code, and I thought I might as well do the math properly for some key algorithms as I go.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm also increasingly convinced that the n log n log n is wrong.p  pIf a is Ob log b where b is Olog c, what is a in terms of cp

Negative 2639 pThere are two unsigned ints x and y that need to be subtracted. x is always larger than y.  However, both x and y can wrap around for example, if they were both bytes, after 0xff comes 0x00.  The problem case is if x wraps around, while y does not. Now x appears to be smaller than y. Luckily, x will not wrap around twice only once is guaranteed. Assuming bytes, x has wrapped and is now 0x2, whereas y has not and is 0xFE.

Its pretty simple if Im asserting just bunch of Integers or Strings. It can also be pretty painful if Im trying to assert a collection of Hibernate domains, say for example. The collection.containsAll.. relies on the equals.. to perform the check, but I always override the equals.. in my Hibernate domains to check only the business keys which is the best practice stated in the Hibernate website and not all the fields of that domain. Sure, it makes sense to check just against the business keys, but there are times I really want to make sure all the fields are correct, not just the business keys for example, new data entry record. So, in this case, I cant mess around with the domain.equals.. and it almost seems like I need to implement some comparators for just unit testing purposes instead of relying on collection.containsAll...p  pAre there some testing libraries I could leverage here How do you test your collectionp  pThanks.p

Negative 2639 pI need some expert advice. I need to model different user types for my web application and am not sure how to best model this. Basically the users for the application are therapists. Essentially there are the users of the application. So do I create a therapist tabledomain object and a therapistDAO, or do I keep a generic user tableuserDAO instead and use role typesnames instead It seems strange having a generic user table and DAO methods always referring to the userTable, when all queries will be against the therapist table. For example, a method to return all therapy types offered by a therapist will be findTherapyTypestherapist, therapistId. However, if I use user tables and User domain object the method would be the findTherapyTypesUser, userId which doesnt seem right. If I use a generic User domain object, then it will have a List of therapytypes which doesnt seem correct as it could in the future a different user type lets say Patient, and in this case the List of therapytyppes would always be null as it wouldnt apply.p  pIn the future there might be other user types, e.g. Patient or Customer those who leave feedback based on treatments received by therapistsp  pI will be using Hibernate so was thinking of using inheritance mapping for the user different user types having a therapist class extend a base User class and implement a User interface with common properties such as firstname, surname etc.p  pAny feedback would be much appreciated  p  pthanks Markp

Negative 2639 pSay you have a project that uses maven and a subversion repository. It consists of quite a lot of modules. So far, development happened in trunk, but now feature branches are to be introduced. This has to be as painless as possible considering all developers on the team should start using feature branches.p  pSo, to create a branch, you use the release plugin which conveniently creates a branch for you, changes the version numbers of all module poms correctly and even updates the codeltscmgtcode section in the parent pom.p  pNow, if you want to reintegrate the feature branch to trunk, there is no matching functionality in the release plugin  you have to do everything by handp  ul liMerge with codereintegratecode flagli liChange the version number in all pomsli liChange the codeltscmgtcode section manuallyli liCommitli ul  pThis is not only cumbersome but also error prone if done by hand every time and this might be frequent when using feature branches extensively. I know that at least the second point could be automated using codereleaseupdateversionscode or codeversionsetcode, but there has to be more, right What am I missingp

Negative 2639 pI have an application that relies on a C callback method to retrieve multitouch information from a macbooks trackpad. Heres the truncated version of how I communicate this data to the userp  pin MT2AppDelegate.hp  precodeimport MyView.h interface MT2AppDelegate  NSObject ltNSApplicationDelegategt          IBOutlet NSTextField L1         IBOutlet MyView MTView  property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet MyView MTView property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet NSTextField L1 codepre  pin MT2AppDelegate.mp  precodeimport etc. etc. static MT2AppDelegate sharedWithCAppDelegateReference implementation MT2AppDelegate synthesize L1, MTView   voidapplicationDidFinishLaunchingNSNotification aNotification      sharedWithCAppDelegateReferenceself      [L1 setStringValueHello]this works         [MTView drawRect2]this also works      MTDeviceRef dev  MTDeviceCreateDefault     MTRegisterContactFrameCallbackdev, callback     MTDeviceStartdev, 0    int callback int example, float etc                   [sharedWithCAppDelegateReferencegtL1 setStringValuehello]this works                  [sharedWithCAppDelegateReferencegtMTView drawRect2]this does NOT work         return 0  codepre  pSo, for some reason, using a function on one IBOutlet works from C just fine, while another one does nothing. The same two functions both work in objectivec. I also cannot seem to call a function from the app delegate inside C. For example, code[sharedWithCAppDelegateReference setPoint]code does nothing. p  pAlso, if there is a more elegant way to do this Im sure there is, Im all ears. What is happening here is that this callback function is constantly updating, reporting the info about finger positions on the trackpad. I want to animate a view so that it gives a visual representation of finger location. The app FingerMgmt does a perfect job of this, but no source code is available.p  pI currently have my app delegate with the callback function inside it, and another class MyView that is the class of the view in my applications window. The app delegate is linked to the view via an IBOutlet in interface builder, and I plan to pass commands to it to update the location of the ovals representing fingers. But again, this is not working for me.p
Negative 2639 pHello there people of stack overflow, I have just started developing with android and have run into a bit of a problem. I am trying to run a very simple app that has a single button, which when clicked updates the text to the current time. However, the app does not even start up. I am following a book. Beginning Android 2, and am just learning about XML layouts. The same app worked without an XML layout, so it may be something to do with my xml. p  pAnyways, Im running it on a droid 2, if that helps.p  pHeres the codes.p  precodepackage apt.tutorial  import android.app.Activity import android.os.Bundle import android.view.View import android.widget.Button import java.util.Date  public class FirstApp extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener       Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 2639 pI currently have an applet and only recently discovered a problem with it, sometimes the whole JVM locks up and becomes unresponsive including the Java console.p  pAny code in the Applet that I have that updates the UI is run on the event dispatch thread.  When the JVM Locked I used JVisualVM to provide a Thread Dump of the JVM. I enclose the output it below. From what I can see is that there are 3 Event Queues, but more worrying is that I think there are 2 EventDispatch threads running and mutually blocking each other in a Deadly Embrace.p  pThe scenario in the applet is as follows, the user wishes to browse on a textfield so we launch the browse window hosted within a JInternalFrame window, the user selects the value they want and then that value is inserted into the TextField and the browse window is dismissed.p  pFrom what I can see is that thread AWTEventQueue2 is updating the field on the EDT and has acquired the writeLock in javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument.replace and tries to invalidate the textfield but waits until thread AWTEventQueue0 releases the Treelock, however AWTEventQueue0 is waiting on a readlock on the same field but wont progress until the thread AWTEventQueue2 releases the writelock, hence the mutual locking. What I dont understand is it appears as if there are at least 2 EDT. p  pI know Im probaly being stupid here but can anyone shed any light on this issue. Thanks in advance.p  pMy Question here is, do you think this is a JVM bug p  pThe Threads of interest here are AWTEventQueue1, AWTEventQueue2 and AWTEventQueue0.p  pre 20110526 123243 Full thread dump

Negative 2639 pIm getting an OutofMemoryError for my android application, and am a bit confused as to whats going on. Basically what happens is, Im able to run it the first few times, but when I try to quit out of it and then open it again quickly and repetitively, I get an out of memory error.p  pIve tried researching this topic, and have found that the recycle method has commonly been the problem. However, Ive called the recycle method on each of the bitmaps which are stored in an object container, stored in an arraylist, but was still getting the problem. p  pAfter doing this, I tried using the Eclipse Memory Analyzer to look at heap dumps, when I came across something weird. After quitting out of the activity back into the launcher activity, and then opening up the activity again via a button, I took screenshots of the heap dump using the memory analyzer. It turns out, with each time I quit and reentered the activity, another instance of the activity object was being created, and the old ones werent being released, even though the onDestroy method was being called which also had the recyclecleanup code. p  pI then tried overriding the finalize method to see if it was being called when the activity quit out back into the launcher activity, but it wasnt being called. I read on some other stackoverflow threads that finalize isnt always called, so in the end, Im still not sure whats going on.p  pstrongUltimately, my question is thisstrong How am I supposed to ensure that the Activity object the activity object itself, not the stuff created from the activity is released after quitting out from the activity into another activityp

Negative 2639 pgiven a mesh made entirely of quads, where every vertex has valence n with n  3, and does not lie on the same plane, I need to find the distance of every vertex in the mesh from a closed set of seed vertices. That is, given one or more mesh vertices a seed set, I need to build a distance map that stores the distance of each mesh vertex from the seed set which will have distance 0 from themselves.p  pafter spending some time searching for possible solutions, I got the following picturep  p1 it is not trivial, and different approaches have been developed during the last 20 years or sop  p2 every algorithm that takes into account a 3d domain is restricted to a triangular domainp  psaid that, this is the picture I gotp  pDijkstra algorithm may be used as a way to find the shortest path between 2 vertices, following the edges of the mesh, but it is very inaccurate and  will lead to an erroneous geodesic. Lanthier LA proposed an improvement, but the error is still quite high.p  pKimmel and Sethian KS proposed a Fast Marching Method FMM to solve the Eikonal equation, addressing the issue calculating the propagation of a wave starting at the seed points and recording the time the wave crosses every vertex. Unfortunately this algorithm, while simple enough to implement, still brings a quite inaccurate result, and care has to be taken to avoid obtuse triangles, or treat them in a very special way. Novotni NV addressed the problem of KS precision in a single seed scenario, but it is unclear to me ifp  pa it still suffers from the obtuse angle problemp  pb when used in a multiple seed points scenario, a single FMM has to be implemented for every single seed in order to find the minimum distance for each mesh vertex from each seed that is, in a 10 seed points scenario, FMM would have to be run 10 times per each mesh vertexp  pOn the other side, an exact algorithm MMP that leads to 0 error has been presented by Mitchell amp al. MI in 87, and AFAIK has never been really implmeneted probably due to the computing power required. On the same exact approach, Surazhsky amp al. SU provided an alternative exact algorithm based on MMP that should outperform the latter in terms of speed, still leading to a correct result. Unfortunately the computing power required for the calculation, even if much less than the original MMP, is still high enough so that realtime interactive implementation is not feasible at this time. SU also proposed an approximation of their exact algorithm, what they called flatexact. It should take the same computational time of FMM, while bringing only 15th of the error, butp  pc it is unclear to me if it can be used in a multiple seeds scenario.p  pOther exact shortest path algorithms have been proposed by Chen amp Han CH and Kapoor KP, but while the first is absolutely slow, the second is just too complicated to be implemented in practice.p  pso.. the bottom line is I need a distance from a set, not the shortest path between 2 points.p  pif I got it right,p  peither I use FMM to get a distance of each vertex from a set in a single pass,p  porp  puse another algorithm to calulate the geodesic from every mesh vertex to every seed point and find the shortest one and If I got it right that would mean calling that algorithm on every seed point for every mesh vertex, that is, on a 10,000 vertex mesh and a seed set of 50 points, I would have to calculate 500,000 geodesics in order to get the 10,000 shortest onep  pAm I missing something is FMM the only way to deal with multiple seeds distances in a single pass Someone knows if the flatexact algorithm may be used in a multiple seed points scenariop  pthnxp  pNotesp  pLA Lanthier amp al.

Negative 2639 pSpoiler Im fairly confident that the answer is codeNOcode, but thats only after a day of very frustrated debugging. Now I would like to know if that is indeed the case and if so, how I might have known, or if Im just doing something completely wrong.p  pHeres the situation. Im using OpenGL ES 2.0 to render some meshes that I load from various files .obj, .md2, etc.. For the sake of performance and User Experience, I delegate the actual loading of these meshes and their associated textures to a background thread using GCD.p  pPer a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1612index.htmlApplesa a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideWorkingwithOpenGLESContextsWorkingwithOpenGLESContexts.htmlinstructionsa, on each background thread, I create and set a new EAGLContext with the same codeshareGroupcode as the main rendering context. This allows OpenGL objects, like texture and buffer objects, that were created on the background thread to be immediately used by the context on the main thread.p  pThis has been working out splendidly. Now, I recently learned about a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgwikiVertexArrayObjectVertex Array Objectsa as a way to cache the OpenGL state associated with rendering the contents of certain buffers. It looks nice, and reduces the boilerplate state checking and setting code required to render each mesh. On top of it all, Apple also recommends using them in their a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexDataTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.htmlBest Practices for Working with Vertex Dataa guide.p  pBut I was having serious issues getting the VAOs to work for me at all. Like I do with all loading, I would load the mesh from a file into memory on a background thread, and then generate all associated OpenGL objects. Without fail, the first time I tried to call codeglDrawElementscode using a VAO, the app crashes with codeEXCBADACCESScode. Without the VAO, it renders fine.p  pDebugging codeEXCBADACCESScode is a pain, especially when NSZombies wont help which they obviously wont, but after some time of analyzing captured OpenGL frames, I realized that, while the creation of the VAO on the background thread went fine no codeGLERRORcode, and a nonzero id, when the time came to bind to the VAO on the main thread, I would get a codeGLINVALIDOPERATIONcode, which a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocsman4xhtmlglBindVertexArray.xmlthe docsa state will happen when attempting to bind to a nonexistent VAO. And sure enough, when looking at all the objects in the current context at the time of rendering, there isnt a single VAO to be seen, embut all of the VBOs that were generated with the VAO strongAT THE SAME TIMEstrong are presentem. If I load the VAO on the main thread it works fine. Very frustrating. p  pI distilled the loading code to a more atomic formp  precode voidgenerate       glGenVertexArraysOES1, ampvao     glBindVertexArrayOESvao      vbos  mallocsizeofGLuint  4     glGenBuffers4, vbos  codepre  pWhen the above is executed on a background thread, with a valid codeEAGLContextcode with the same codeshareGroupcodeas the main context, the main context will have 4 VBOs, but no VAO. If I execute it on the main thread, with the main context, it will have 4 VBOs, and the VAO. This leads me to the conclusion that there is some weird exception to the objectsharing nature of codeEAGLContextcodes when dealing with VAOs. If that were actually the case, I would have really expected the Apple docs to note that somewhere. Its very inconvenient to have to discover little tidbits like that by hand. Is this the case, or am I missing somethingp

Negative 2639 pIm evaluating PHPStorm right now, and Ive really grown fond of it. Its fast, has more or less everything perfectly implemented and the flow flows like a breeze...p  pThe only thing bugging me and thats a big one is, that it doesnt seem to get the namespaces for my symfony2 project right.p  pSee, in Netbeans, when I type codeuse Symf[CTRLSPACE]code it show me all the Symfony namespaces, right out of the codevendorscode folder.p  pIf I do the same in PHPStorm, no namesapces are shown. That means that the whole code copletion doesnt work for the vendor libraries, which is really very, very bad in terms of easy and fast programming.p  pNow, Im quite sure that Im just missing a setting somewhere, but I just cant find it.p

Negative 2639 pI have always avoided the C casts codestaticcastcode, codeconstcastcode, codedynamiccastcode [I also avoid RTTI], etc because I regard them as a waste of typing and I never saw any advantages, so I use Cstyle casts exclusively.p  pMy question is, if you have an inheritance hierarchy and a pointer to the base type, can you safely cast a base pointer to a derived pointer with a Cstyle cast provided that somehow you are absolutely sure the base pointer points to an instance of a derived type without something happening behind the scenes that will cause seemingly inexplicable failuresp  pI ask this because I read in one of the comments on another question that using a Cstyle cast from a base to a derived type will not adjust the pointer or something like that. Ill try to find the exact comment again.p

So far I only have a binary  decimal conversion going, and it works fine however whenever the binary number entered is 8 digits or more it crashes.p  pAs far as I can tell when I input the number 10011001 it gets translated to scientific notation and becomes 1.0011001E7 which wouldnt really be a problem, except that the way I am converting the numbers involves creating a string with the same value as the number and breaking it into individual characters. Unfortunately, this means I have a string valued 1.0011001E7 instead of 10011001, so when I cut up the characters I hit the . and the program doesnt know what to do when I try to make calculations with that.

Negative 2639 pThis is more of curiosity that anything, but I can think of several places mainly in admin sections where this could be useful. I know the title is confusing so this is what I meanp  pSay you have a form that posts to examplecb.php. examplecb.php is a very large callback page that generates multiple thumbnails of an image, puts them in their respective directories, adds them to a database, etc. You already have the form posting by jquery with a function like thisp  precode.postexamplecb.php, this.serialize, functiondata      Success , json codepre  pBefore posting it updates a div to say processing of something. Then after it successfully completes the div fades out. However you want the div to show what is happening on the server side. i.e. Converting 200X200 thumb  Converting 350x350 thumb  Adding Records to Database  etc.p  pHow can you accomplish thisp  pI know its a loaded question, but Im confident there are people on here smart enough to figure it out.

I also reproduced this in a sample project.p  pTried with and without various RTTI directives without change.p  pIs this a bug, a known limitation  Is there a workaround except removing fixed values of the enumerationp  pUsing Delphi2010 EntUpdate5p  pb[Edit] The answer below provides the workaround The first value of the enumeration must be set to 0 instead of 1, and values contiguous.

Negative 2639 pCurrently I am working on a program that lets me handle data in form of an image. Lets say I have datapoints that correspond to an image maybe 300 x 300 and the values range from 0 to 10000 and I would like to display the image in grey values. That would be all fine, if I just split the value range 010000 into 256 pieces and assigned them according grey values in bitmap form I used rgb by setting all colours to be equal.p  pHowever, the user has to be able to change the contrast and the brightness. By that I mean Lets say the value that corresponds to black is 3000 and obviously all values below are also black and the values that correspond to white are 5000. The values in between should have a linear dependence on the grey colour. The user will have two sliders, one to change the range of observable values in this case 2000 and one to shift the range lets say from 30005000 to 50007000. The problem is actually to make the sliders work in real time.

So It is a little bit notflexible.p  p5.I also, cannot just initialize label in my designer, I have to do all initialization in constructor manuallyp  precodelabel2.Text  rm.GetStringDefaultString, culture  or in Designer partial class inside InitializeComponent method  but also, manually. codepre  p6.And finally, When Somebody changes languagep  pI have to call adjustCulture function in Load event in EVERY window, always First of all, to initialize.. and secondly, when somebody in MDI menu changes Language to German and I have opened three windows in my MDI at that moment..

Negative 2639 pWe are running Cascading with a Sink Tap being configured to store in Amazon S3 and were facing some FileAlreadyExistsException see [1]. This was only from time to time 1 time on around 100 and was not reproducable.p  pDigging into the Cascading codem, we discovered the Hfs.deleteResource is called among others by the BaseFlow.deleteSinksIfNotUpdate. Btw, we were quite intrigued with the silent NPE with comment hack to get around npe thrown when fs reaches root directory.p  pFrom there, we extended the Hfs tap with our own Tap to add more action in the deleteResource method see [2] with a retry mechanism calling directly the getFileSystemconf.delete.p  pThe retry mechanism seemed to bring improvement, but we are still sometimes facing failures see example in [3] it sounds like HDFS returns isDeletedtrue, but asking directly after if the folder exists, we receive existstrue, which should not happen. Logs also shows randomly isDeleted true or false when the flow succeeds, which sounds like the returned value is irrelevant or not to be trusted.p  pCan anybody bring his own S3 experience with such a behavior folder should be deleted, but it is not We suspect a S3 issue, but could it also be in Cascading or HDFSp  pWe run on Hadoop Clouderacdh3u5 and Cascading 2.0.1wipdev.p  p[1]p  precodeorg.apache.hadoop.mapred.FileAlreadyExistsException Output directory s3n... already exists     at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat.checkOutputSpecsFileOutputFormat.java132     at com.twitter.elephantbird.mapred.output.DeprecatedOutputFormatWrapper.checkOutputSpecsDeprecatedOutputFormatWrapper.java75     at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobClient2.runJobClient.java923     at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobClient2.runJobClient.java882     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at javax.security.auth.Subject.doAsSubject.java396     at org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.doAsUserGroupInformation.java1278     at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobClient.submitJobInternalJobClient.java882     at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobClient.submitJobJobClient.java856     at cascading.flow.hadoop.planner.HadoopFlowStepJob.internalNonBlockingStartHadoopFlowStepJob.java104     at cascading.flow.planner.FlowStepJob.blockOnJobFlowStepJob.java174     at cascading.flow.planner.FlowStepJob.startFlowStepJob.java137     at cascading.flow.planner.FlowStepJob.callFlowStepJob.java122     at cascading.flow.planner.FlowStepJob.callFlowStepJob.java42     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTaskSync.innerRunFutureTask.java303     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runFutureTask.java138     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runTaskThreadPoolExecutor.java886     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java908     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.j codepre  p[2]p  precode  Override   public boolean deleteResourceJobConf conf throws IOException      LOGGER.infoDeleting resource , getIdentifier      boolean isDeleted  super.deleteResourceconf     LOGGER.infoHfs Sink Tap isDeleted is  for , isDeleted,         getIdentifier      Path path  new PathgetIdentifier      int retryCount  0     int cumulativeSleepTime  0     int sleepTime  1000      while getFileSystemconf.existspath        LOGGER           .info               Resource  still exists, it should not...

Negative 2639 pI have a question regarding an app which stores its data in SQLite. The data is read using strongFMDBstrong wrapper, and must be updated transparently to the user if the server side database changes.p  pTo accomplish this, Im replacing the entire codeFMDatabasecode object in my singleton with a new one whenever a new database is downloaded.p  pHowever, for a split second queries will fail, for example if the user is currently scrolling a table view.p  pSo the question is, how do I replace the currently open code.sqlitecode file while retaining the current queuep  pEdit Queries are run against the database very often, for example when scrolling a view there are counts so there is no easy way to block the user from interacting with the database for a moment.p

Negative 2639 pI always use a CSS preprocessor for webrelated projects. A CSS preprocessor pretty much lets you do everything that CSS lets you do, but enables DRY coding principles and cleaner syntax. Im wondering though  why not drop the style sheets completely Why not make a stylinglanguage that compiles to JavaScript instead JavaScript apparently has full control over CSS styles anyway so it should be possible. Such a language would also be much more powerful than vanilla CSS since it would enable logic, such as selectors based on element sizes and positions, browser window size etc. A contrived example of possibilitiesp  precodedivtest      if windowWidth gt 800px          width windowWidth  3  10px         height 200px          else          width 100px         height 50px       codepre  pOr a div that is positioned absolutely, but should follow the window when it scrolls too far downp  precodedivsidepanel      position absolute     top 100px     right 25px      if windowScrollY gt 90px          position fixed         top 10px       codepre  pI have Googled this topic to the best of my ability without any success. strongAre there any styling languages that allows for dynamic styles such as those in my example, and compiles down to JavaScriptstrong If not, why not Is this not viable performancewise Or are there perhaps browser support issuesp  hr  pI know some browsers, including Chrome, exposes an object called codedocument.styleSheetscode that gives JavaScript full control over the documents styles, which would be perfect for this kind of project.p

Negative 2639 pI was reading about how when possible the java compiler will compile strings concatenated with the  operator into instances of StringBuilder, and how this makes it better to use the simple  operator since they a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1532461stringbuildervsstringconcatenationintostringinjavacompile to the same codea. Except when you are building the string in a while loop, in which case it is clearly best to use a StringBuilder.p  pIve also read that the .concat method on strings is the worst a hrefhttpkaioa.comnode59choice all the timea so much so that it was made into a bug by a hrefhttpfindbugs.sourceforge.netFindbugsa.p  pSo I decided to test it myself writing a little java class in eclipse.

Obviously all the stackoverflow answers I read saying that  operators compile into normal old StringBuilder instances must be outdated. p  pDoes anyone know whats really going on herep  pIm using jdk1.7.007, and so far as I can tell both eclipse and my command line are referencing the exact same one.

Negative 2639 pI want to build such a system, there are 3 nodes, A, B and C A and B establish a TCP connection, then A tell C the ports, sequence number seqnoand Acknowlegement sequence numberackseqno. Then C sends packet to B C and A share the same IP but they are far away from each other, e.g, C spoof IP of Ap  pif B never sends data packets to IPAonly ACK, C can send packets to B with correct seqno and ackseqno but sometimes if B send a data packet P1to IPA,p  p1 A immediately send ACK for the data packet P1 to B, and A tell C the new ackseqno. But there is a delay between A and C, so before C knows the new ackseqno C may send some data packetswith spoofed IPA to B with obsolete ackseqno.p  pmy first question is what will C behave when it receives a data packet with obsolete ackseqnop  p2 if I delay the ACK for p1 from A to B, I let A tell C first, and then sends the ACK for p1. there are 2 questions p  p1 since B is waiting for the ACK of p1 from A, it may retransmit the packet p1, how to increase the retransmission timeout if each time A reply with the ACK with such a delay, the timeout will be naturally increased, then it is not a problemp  p2 if C sends data packets to Bwith IP of A before the ACKfor p1 from A to B. This means the data packets are with updated ackseqno, but B doesnt know whether its new ackseqno has been known by A or notcoz ACK hasnt arrived yet, so it may regard the ACK is piggybacked over the data packets then how will B deal with the late ACKp

Negative 2639 pI have a QTableView with one column that uses a QLineEdit as its editor delegate, and other columns that need to update dynamically as the user types into the QLineEdit e.g. one of the columns contains the length of the text typed in the QLineEdit and it should update as the user types, not waiting for them to hit Enter to commit.p  pI used this code a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10081033qtsignalwhileaqtableviewitemdataisbeingeditedinsteadofaftereditisQt Signal while a QTableView item data is being edited instead of after edit is donea which mostly works.  It connects the QLineEdit textChanged signal to the editors commitData signal.p  pThe problem with this code is that as the user types, the QLineEdits insertion cursor always jumps to the end.  If you are appending text to the end of the line thats fine.  But if the user wants to insert or edit text in the middle of the line, every time they type one letter, the text insertion cursor jumps to the end of the QLineEdit. After each keystroke they have to reposition the cursor in order to finish the insertionedit in the middle.p  pIf I disable the mapper then the cursor doesnt jump, so it isnt something inherent to the editor delegate it only happens when using the code from the question linked above.p  pI looked at the code for QLineEdit textChanged and commitData but I cant figure out what is causing the cursor to jump to the end of the QLineEdit.  Any ideas Thanksp

But now because its not been instantiated, functions inside Model can not access store by codethis.storecode. p  pWhat I did, is I started also adding store to the constructor itself codeModel.store  options.storecode which fixes the problem. But now store is exposed to anything that uses Model constructor and this is not desirable.p  pI am guessing I am doing something wrong. So I would appreciate some help.p

Im learning Java as I go, so for all I know this could be the dumbest way of going about centering  any suggestionsp  pHere is the java I wrote up  youll see some lines with .zoomy in them, these are for a magnifying glass scriptp  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idimagegallerygt      ltdiv idtestcentergt   ltspan idhoverpadgt ltspan classmoreimagesgtmore imagesltspangt ltdiv idthumbscolbggtltdivgt ltdiv idthumbnailscolgt      ltimg srcimagesinteriorcontents331.jpg classverticalthumbs idimgbutton1gt     ltimg srcimagesinteriorcontents332.jpg classverticalthumbs idimgbutton2gt     ltimg srcimagesinteriorcontents333.jpg classverticalthumbs idimgbutton3gt     ltimg srcimagesinteriorcontents334.jpg classverticalthumbs idimgbutton4gt     ltbr gtltbr gt  ltdivgt ltspangt       lta hrefimagesinteriorcontents32.JPG classzoomgt     ltimg srcimagesinteriorcontents32.JPG idlargeimagegt     ltagt codepre  p     p  pJAVASCRIPTp  precodeimgbutton1.clickfunction           largeimage.attrsrc,imagesinteriorcontents31.JPG         imagegallery a.attrhref,imagesinteriorcontents31.JPG         var imagewidth  largeimage.width testcenter.widthimagewidth         .zoom.zoomyborder1px solid fff, zoomSize 300, glare     false,                     zoomStart function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  none ,                     zoomStop function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  block       imgbutton2.clickfunction           largeimage.attrsrc,imagesinteriorcontents32.JPG         imagegallery a.attrhref,imagesinteriorcontents32.JPG         var imagewidth  largeimage.width testcenter.widthimagewidth         .zoom.zoomyborder1px solid fff, zoomSize 300, glare false,                     zoomStart function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  none ,                     zoomStop function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  block      imgbutton3.clickfunction           largeimage.attrsrc,imagesinteriorcontents33.JPG         imagegallery a.attrhref,imagesinteriorcontents33.JPG         var imagewidth  largeimage.width testcenter.widthimagewidth         .zoom.zoomyborder1px solid fff, zoomSize 300, glare false,                     zoomStart function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  none ,                     zoomStop function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  block      imgbutton4.clickfunction           largeimage.attrsrc,imagesinteriorcontents34.JPG         imagegallery a.attrhref,imagesinteriorcontents34.JPG         var imagewidth  largeimage.width testcenter.widthimagewidth         .zoom.zoomyborder1px solid fff, zoomSize 300, glare false,                     zoomStart function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  none ,                     zoomStop function     hoverpad.cssdisplay  block       window.loadfunction var imagewidth  largeimage.width var textwidth  .projecttext.width testcenter.widthimagewidth  if largeimage.width lt 500      bottomborder.widthtextwidth     right.right30  else  bottomborder.widthimagewidth .projecttext.widthimagewidth   codepre

Negative 2639 pTwo engineers are working on an android project. To publish the apk not on Playstore, but private publication, they each run their project and then get the resulting apk and then publish. As it turns out a user cannot simply update between the apks produced from the two different computers. If a users current apk was published by developer Zack to update to the latest version, which happen to come from developer Max, the user must in fact delete and reinstall.  How do I resolve this problem I was hoping to find whatever key is used on one of the computers and pass it to the other developer. But I cant find where the keys are stored.p  pNaturally, I would use codeAndroid Tools gt Export Signed Application Packagecode to publish. But the present situation is as above. How do I fix that problem without having users continuously deleting or  on the other hand  restrict publication to one machinep

Negative 2639 pHi Im doing a project for school, Im only doing the frontend of the coding and one of the requirements is that I filter my blog categories with jQuery. Usually I would use PHP and just filter it based off of the parameter but this project is all static code and no DB. Currently I have two pages for the blog, codeblog.htmlcode and codeblogpost.htmlcode both with a sidebar that has the categories. My approach right now is have a id for each category and whenever that link is click Ill hide the current listing of blog posts and show the ones with the matching class, my problem is though when Im on my codeblogpost.htmlcode page and click the filter link it obviously fails as the content its looking for isnt in the DOM. What would be the best approach around this, I have an idea that I just put all the content on one page like codeblog.htmlcode and then hide the codeblogpost.htmlcode content unless someone clicked the read more button is this a good approach or is there something better Thanks in advance for any helpp  pstrongBLOG.HTMLstrongp  precodelt Filters gt ltulgt         ltligt         lta idwebdesign classfilter hrefhttpwww.site.combloggtWeb Designltagt     ltligt     ltligt          lta idwebdevelopment classfilter hrefhttpwww.site.combloggtWeb Developmentltagt     ltligt ltulgt  lt Articles gt ltarticle classlayoutarticle webdesigngt     lth3 classtitlemediumgtLorem Ipsum 2lth3gt     ltpgtDonec in sem a nulla eleifend ...ltpgt     lta hrefhttpwww.site.comblogloremipsum2gtRead Moreltagt ltarticlegt  ltarticle classlayoutarticle webdevelopmentgt     lth3 classtitlemediumgtLorem Ipsum 1lth3gt     ltpgtSuspendisse convallis egestas ...ltpgt     lta hrefhttpwww.site.comblogloremipsum1gtRead Moreltagt ltarticlegt codepre  pstrongBLOGPOST.HTMLstrongp  precodelt Filters gt ltulgt         ltligt         lta idwebdesign classfilter hrefhttpwww.site.combloggtWeb Designltagt     ltligt     ltligt          lta idwebdevelopment classfilter hrefhttpwww.site.combloggtWeb Developmentltagt     ltligt ltulgt  lt Article gt ltarticle classlayoutarticle webdesigngt     lth3 classtitlemediumgtLorem Ipsum 2lth3gt     ltpgtDonec in sem a nulla eleifend vivamus velit dolor, blandit quis sodales quis, ullamcorper vitae sem.

Negative 2639 pI have a Node server which sends streaming tweets to clients as they connect, using Sockets.io and ntwitter. At the moment all the tweets from different users get sent to every client. But each client only requires a certain subset of tweets, and Id like to the server to only send that subset or category.p  pI emthinkem that having each category being like a room, in Sockets, would work, but I cant quite work out how to adapt my code to use them.

Negative 2639 pIm porting my app from iOS 6 to IOS 7 there will eventually be a complete GUI redesign for iOS 7 but in the meanwhile just getting the existing GUI to display properly on iOS 7 is the goal.p  pI had the issue where the status bar was overlapping my GUI and so have shifted the Y origin of the view controllers view down by 20.p  pHowever my app contains a pulldown which when retracted is overlapping with the status bar. In the screenshot the  red is a button which is present in the pulldown view. The grey bar is the top of the main view behind which a portion of pulldown is hiding when retracted. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com29mcx.png altenter image description herep  pI implemented the pull down as a fixed size child subview of the main view and when retracted its Y origin is a negative number thus it is effectively still displayed but off the top of the screen. When the user pulls it down I just animate the increase in the Y origin until eventually the origin is 0. p  pIs there some way I can make the pull down view appear beneath the status bar or some other quick solution Note of course I cant simply toggle the pulldowns alpha to displayhide it as it pullsdown obviously thus its appearancedisappearance is not a discreen action.  I could maybe attempt to make the portion of it that is on top of the status bar invisible but as its something that is moving that seems like its going to be complicated.

Negative 2639 pIm creating a web service and I need to map a bunch of String names to set of database names. That is, a request will arrive with a data item, and I need to figure out which database it maps to.p  pTo create this mapping, I need to query the database also, preferably only once. I want to be able to access this mapping whenever requests come in and not have to construct my map on each request. What I dont want, is to have to query the database 10 times every 10 seconds, which is potentially what could happen, in this case.p  pI considered storing the map as a static member variable upon the first request. So my question is  are there any known issues with having this map as static and sharing across requestsp

Negative 2639 pI am currently doing some benchmark tests using OpenCL on an AMD Radeon HD 7870.p  pThe code that I have written in JOCL the Java bindings for OpenCL simply adds two 2D arrays z x  y but it does so many times zxyyyyyy....p  pThe size of the two arrays I am adding is 500 by 501 and I am looping over the number of iterations I want to add them together on the GPU. So first I add them once, then ten times, then one thousand times, etc.p  pThe maximum number of iterations that I loop to is 100,000,000. Below is what the log file looks like when I run my code counter is the number of times my program executes in 5 secondsp  precodeNumber of Iterations 1 Counter 87 FLOPS Rate 0.0043310947 GFLOPss  Number of Iterations 10 Counter 88 FLOPS Rate 0.043691948 GFLOPss  Number of Iterations 100 Counter 84 FLOPS Rate 0.41841218 GFLOPss   Number of Iterations 1000 Counter 71 FLOPS Rate 3.5104263 GFLOPss  Number of Iterations 10000 Counter 8 FLOPS Rate 3.8689642 GFLOPss  Number of Iterations 100000 Counter 62 FLOPS Rate 309.70895 GFLOPss  Number of Iterations 1000000 Counter 17 FLOPS Rate 832.0814 GFLOPss  Number of Iterations 10000000 Counter 2 FLOPS Rate 974.4635 GFLOPss  Number of Iterations 100000000 Counter 1 FLOPS Rate 893.7945 GFLOPss codepre  pDo these numbers make sense I feel that 0.97 TeraFLOPS is quite high and that I must be calculating the number of FLOPs incorrectly. p  pAlso, I believe that the number of FLOPs I am calculating should at one point level out with an increase in the number of iterations but that is not so evident here. It seems that if I continue to increase the number of iterations, the calculated FLOPS will also increase which also leads me to believe that I am doing something wrong.p  pJust for reference, I am calculating the FLOPS in the following wayp  pFLOPS  counter500501iterationstimeelapsedp  pAny help with this issue will be greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp  pEDITp  pI have now done this same benchmark test looping over a range of iterations the amount of times I add y to x as well as array sizes. I have generated the following surface plot as can be seen at this GitHub repositoryp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comke0mSeniorDesignblobmasterJOCLGraphingGoodGPUPlot.PNG relnofollowhttpsgithub.comke0mSeniorDesignblobmasterJOCLGraphingGoodGPUPlot.PNGap  pI have asked the opinion of others on this plot and they mention to me that while the numbers I am calculating are feasible, they are artificially high. They say this is evident in the steep slope in the plot that does not really make any physical sense. One suggested idea as to why the slope is so steep is because the compiler converts the variable that controls the iterations of type int to a short and therefore forces this number to stay below 32000 approximately. That means that I am doing less work on the GPU then I think I am and calculating a higher GFLOPS value.p  pCan anyone confirm this idea or offer any other ideas as to why the plot looks the way it doesp  pThank you againp

Negative 2639 pI have been developing a cadlike drawing app for iOS, which makes careful use of dirty rect clipping to make for a smooth drawing experience  it has worked quite well for months. Now, I know iOS doesnt automatically clip dirty rects, but CoreGraphics will. For reference, heres what the preamble of my main views drawRect function looks like leaving out the actual drawing mechanismp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectdirtyRect      CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext     CGContextSaveGStatecontext      if  CGRectIsNulldirtyRect              CGContextClipToRect context, dirtyRect            CGContextConcatCTM context, self.viewTransform       .... drawing here, all done by CG vector and bitmap functionsa      CGContextRestoreGState context   codepre  pNow, this code worked beautifully for a long time, iOS6, early iOS7 builds, etc. Smooth as butter. But just recently, Ive been seeing a VERY odd set of behaviors, and Im curious if anybody here has had similar experiences.p  pFirst, I trigger redraws the normal way, setNeedsDisplay when I need to redraw the whole view, and setNeedsDisplayInRect passing a dirty rect for just the small bit that needs redrawing. Weirdly, recently when I call setNeedsDisplayInRect the rect I pass is emignoredem, and instead drawRect receives a rect matching the views emboundsem and not the intended subrect. I only noticed this when testers reported dramatically bad drawing performance compared to previous builds  Ive been using the simulator too much recently and hadnt noticed p  pI suspected this might be the result of some kind of multipledirtyrect union, so I overloaded setNeedsDisplay and setNeedsDisplayInRect, tracing when they got called, but that let nowhere. So then I decided to track my dirty rect manually as an iVar in the my rendering view class. Heres where the second oddity shows up when I clip to the now emcorrectem dirty rect, the contents outside the dirty rect are cleared.p  pThey should NOT be cleared. I have explicitly set self.clearsContextBeforeDrawing  NO, so I dont understand why the behavior Im seeing is happening, particularly when it wasnt happening in the past.p  pNow, Im probably going to do a gitbisect style of debugging to see if I can find a version way back when which didnt have this bug. But Im hoping somebody here with CoreGraphics experience can lend me some conceptual support. This has me totally baffled.p  pP.S. I havent touched the drawing code for my app in a long time since Ive spent the last few months developing the app emaroundem the drawing tools. This is why I suspect a change to iOS7s drawing pipeline may play some kind of role here.p
Negative 2639 pUsing Djangos ORM, I am trying to find instances of myModel based on two of its datetime variables specifically, where the months of these two datetimes are not equal. I understand to filter by the value of a modelfield, you can use Djangos a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevrefmodelsqueriesfexpressions relnofollowF  expressionsa, so I thought Id try something like thisp  precodemyModel.objects.filterfixeddatemonthFcloseddatemonth codepre  pI know this wouldnt find instances where they arent equal, but I thought itd be a good first step since Ive never used the F expressions before. However, it doesnt work as I thought it should.

Negative 2639 pIn PowerShell, I believe Im observing that PowerShell is attempting to delete folders before their contents are deleted.

Negative 2639 pSummary I am seeing Java thread leaks when calling back into Java from native code on a nativelycreated thread.p  pUpdate 11 Feb 2014 We raised this as a support request with Oracle. It has now been a hrefhttpsbugs.openjdk.java.netbrowseJDK8033696confirmeda by Oracle on Java 7 update 45. It only affects 64bit Linux and possibly Mac platforms 32bit Linux is unaffected.p  pUpdate 29 April 2014 Oracle have a fix for this issue, and it will be released in Java 7 update 80.p  pI have an application consisting of a Java layer and a native library. The Java layer calls into the native library via JNI this then causes a new native thread to start running, which calls back into Java. Because the new native thread is not attached to the JVM, it needs to be attached prior to doing the callback, then detached afterwards. The usual way to do this seems to be to bracket the code that calls back into Java with AttachCurrentThread  DetachCurrentThread calls. This works fine, but for our application which calls back into Java very frequently the overhead of attaching and detaching every time is significant.p  pThere is an optimization described in several places like a hrefhttpw01fe.comblog200905ccallbacksintojavaviajnimadeeasyierherea and a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingarticlesperfjni.htmlherea that recommends using mechanisms based on thread local storage to eliminate this problem essentially every time the native callback is triggered, the thread is tested to see if it is already attached to the JVM if not, it is attached to the JVM and the thread local storage mechanism is used to automatically detach the thread when it exits. I have implemented this, but although the attach and detach appears to be occurring correctly, this causes a leak of threads on the Java side. I believe I am doing everything correctly and am struggling to see what might be wrong. I have been bashing my head on this for a while now and I would be very grateful for any insights.p  pI have recreated the problem in cutdown form. Below is the code for the native layer. What we have here is a wrapper that encapsulates the process of returning a JNIEnv pointer for the current thread, using the POSIX threadlocal storage mechanism to automatically detach the thread if it wasnt already attached. There is a callback class that acts as a proxy for the Java callback method. I have used callback to a static Java method in order to eliminate the extra complication of creating and deleting global object references to the Java object, which are irrelevant to this problem. Finally there is a JNI method that when called, constructs a callback, and creates a new native thread and waits for it to complete. This newly created thread calls the callback once then exits. p  precodeinclude ltjni.hgt include ltiostreamgt include ltpthread.hgt   using namespace std    Class to automatically handle getting

Im using MinGW, Eclipse Kepler and Windows 7 64 bit.p  pThanks in advance.p

How can I have multiple .cpp files in a workspace and run different ones This might be a fundamentally different thing than in java where you could just select the class, and if it had a main method run it from there, but any help would be appreciated.

Negative 2639 pI have two csv files which contain serial numbers for equipment. One of them has the correct serial numbers directly scanned from the equipment. The other report is from our inventory system. I want to crossreference both lists to see which items are on both lists and at the same time I want to check possible matches for serial numbers.p  pI will be programming this in java. p  pExample 1p  pList A Serial Number AGJC021645p  pList B Serial Number AGJC021645p  pThat would be an exact match. But that one is fairly easy.p  pExample 2p  pList A Serial Number AGJC01254p  pPossible Matches from List B AGJC01253, AGJC00254, etc etc....p  pThen with this I can tell my inventory staff to verify them. It could have been a typing error when they entered it into the system.p  pWorst case scenario Id have to create my own pattern matching algorithm but there could be some library that already does this.p  pThanksp

In fact, under this reasoning, due to the fact that lines from different files may be requested simultaneously, the read head may need to move significantly from time to time, causing the multiproc approach to be slower than a serial approach. So I decided to go back to a single process to read my logfiles.p  pInterestingly though, I noticed that I did get a speedup with small files lt 40KB, and that it was only with large files  445MB that the expected slowdown was noticed.p  pThis leads me to believe that python may read files in chunks, whose size exceeds more than the one line I request at a time.p  pstrongQ1strong So what is the strongfilereading mechanismstrong under the hoodp  pstrongQ2strong What is the best way to optimize the reading of files from a strongconventional HDDstrongp  pTechnical specsp  ul lipython3.3li li5400rpm conventional HDDli liMac OSX 10.9.2 Mavericksli ul

Negative 2639 pI am writing code using GWT, and I have created a java.util.Timer ememulationem, which I could like to emtestem. In Java, I would create a Timer, fire a task on it, wait until the task was executed, and then return from successfully the unit test method or fail, after some timeout expired.p  pI dont know much about JavaScript which is why I use GWT, but I have seen examples using the JavaScript native timer functions setTimeoutsetInterval, where the handlercallback, emused a flag to make sure it was not called while executingem. In other words, some example saidimplied that it is empossibleem that while the callbackhandler takes long to execute, it then gets emcalled againem, as the interval ran out once more. And so the examples used some flag, which the callback checked to make sure it does nothing if the last call to it did not end yet.p  pThis made me assume that I can use setInterval indirectly, through GWT, to get some callback to be executed emwhile my code is waitingem. Since there is no sleep in JavaScript, I used a busy loop instead, but the callback never got executed.p  pSo, is it that my assumption about async callback is wrong sometimes, always, or that the GWT Timer class or htmlunit itself somehow prevents this behavior idk how the GWT Timer is implemented internallyp  pAnd more importantly, how can I then test my java.util.Timer emulation in a GWTTestCase, if any TimerTask I create within a test method call simply wont execute until the test method call returnedp  pIn the real application, there will be a game loop, and the timer tasks are free to run between the game loop cycles.p  pGWT code is something likep  precodepublic class TimerTest extends GWTTestCase      public void testScheduleLong          final Timer timer  new Timertest         final boolean[] marker  new boolean[]  false          new com.google.gwt.user.client.Timer              Override             public void run                  marker[0]  true                      .schedule10          assertFalsemarker[0], marker[0]         double value  Long.MAXVALUE          Waste time, to see if marker changes         final long start  System.currentTimeMillis         while marker[0] ampamp System.currentTimeMillis  start lt 1000              value  Math.sqrtvalue             if value gt 1                  value  Long.MAXVALUE                               assertTruemarker[0], marker[0]       codepre

Using the shared library, my app is able to encryptdecrypt data between any of the followingp  ul liLinux i386li liLinux x8664li liLinux PPCli liAIX RISCli ul  pThese can decrypt their own data, but NOT each other, nor any of the abovep  ul liSolaris i386li liSolaris SPARCli ul  pI first thought this was an endian issue, butAIXRISC and LinuxPPC are BE, and they seem to play well wit the Linux i386 and x8664 LE.p  pThe Solaris systems arep  precodeSunOS pluto 5.9 GenericVirtual sun4u sparc SUNW,SPARCEnterpriseT5120 SunOS nemo 5.9 Generic11855911 i86pc i386 i86pc codepre  pThe libcrypto.so was compiled withp  precode[openssl1.0.1g] .Configure solarissparcv9cc shared  [openssl1.0.1g] .Configure solarisx86cc shared codepre  pNOTE that the Solaris systems both use optSUNWsprobincc as the compiler, and all others use gcc.p  pI have verified that I am always starting with the same IVcounter and symkey when encrypting and decrypting.

Negative 2639 pI would like to build something like ISSUU but I am not sure how to do it.

What I want is a way to make it in the website, not by having to log in in another website or by having to install some software in my pc.p  pI am not asking for the code here. What I would like to get from you is tips of where to start, maybe some tut, some technique, etc...p  pMy preference is that the system uses CSS3 and HTML5, but other suggestions are also welcome. I would like to avoid Flash due to problems on mobile devices.p  pSo, how would I do this Many thanks in advancep

Negative 2639 pI am trying to convert an XML document into LaTeX using XSLT. I have two tags codeltlingtcode and codeltgragtcode which, roughly speaking, correspond to a paragraph and a choice of text size, respectively. However, in the case where codeltlingtcode is run from within a codeltblok ryklyrikgtcode tag, I want codeltlingtcode to be applied identically to codeltlin ryklanggtltgra str1gtcode. I know I could just copy the definition of the latter, but for several reasons, the mentioned solution is to be preferred.

Negative 2639 pI was wondering if there is any efficient algorithm for finding matches for a set S  t1, t2, ..., tn of small strongbinarytreesstrong in a big strongbinarytreestrong T The binary trees here are ordered and labeled, i.e., every node has a label and the leftright child cannot be swapped.p  pA match of ti in T means that there is a subtree a connected component of T being identical to ti.p  pThe naive method would be scanning over every node of T and trying to match t1, t2, ..., one by one. I was thinking if there is anything like emAhoCroskikem string matching algorithm, which locates a set of short strings patterns in a long text by linear time complexity w.r.t. the sum of lengths of all the pattern strings and text.p  pThanks in advance. Any pointers to references etc would also be much appreciatedp

Negative 2639 pIm trying to understand a book from Don Gosselin on ASP.NET Programming with Visual C.

Negative 2639 pI am working on an interface for a simulator that is meant to be friendly to people who prefer the command line to a GUI. To give the simulator the levels, the user types the information into a file, which is then parsed and generates design points, which are then sent to a main server. p  pI would like to be able to implement some sort of range feature so that the user will not need to type out all of the individual levels. More power is needed than a simple additive sequence. Since the parser and related code is already in Python, this seems like a perfect use case for list comprehensions. However, the list comprehension is user input and not guaranteed to be valid. Using codeevalcode seems too dangerous, and codeliteralevalcode does not support list comprehensions. p  pMy current goal is for something like this to be valid and safep  precodeFactor 1 [1,2,3,7,8], Factor 2 [2x for x in range5,20 if x  3  0] codepre  pThe base format for files that the user types is JSON. I am looking to extend the language to have additional features like coderangecode to fill various user needs. Data set 1 can be parsed in the existing system. The list comprehension will be evaluated on the users machine, so simple attacks like codex999999999999code are selfdestructive.p  pIt seems relatively easy to sanitize the coderangecode function using a regex, but Im not sure how to make sure that the other parts are safe. Are regexes sufficient for this task, or is there another approach I should be followingp

Five of these contain a single option and two contain two mutually exclusive options.

databasetable has no column named tablerowthree.p  pI am really confused to why the columns tablerowthree and tablerowfour are not showing up on my table, and why only id, tablerowone, and tablerowtwo appear in my data table.p  pHere is my Database classp  precodeDatabaseHandler.java   import java.util.ArrayList  import android.content.ContentValues import android.content.Context import

Negative 2639 pI have a python based website on appengine. What this means is my server is written in python and I am using the usual webapp2 and jinja2 to help serve my pages. What I want to accomplish is that depending on whether someone is accessing my website through iPhone, Android, or a normal computer i.e. desktop or laptop to server the webpage in appropriate format. I supposed there are many ways I can do thisp  ol liI could do it through JavaScript and then redirect to the appropriate mobile urlli liOr I can do it in Python and serve the correct pageli ol  pWhat I mean in code2code is something likep  precodeclass ServeMyPagewebapp2.RequestHandler     def getself       ...do some work to determine the device, such as screen size       if deviceiPhone         ...get the iPhone page and serve it         self.response.out.writeiPhonePage       else ... etc, etc codepre  pIn my snippet I am doing it before serving the page. I imagine this is faster as it does not wait for the page to load and then check with some JavaScript to see if I should change the content to the appropriate format.

Negative 2639 pI have 6 different applications on FB which have one database with users. All of them was created long time ago, on V1.0 and I have several hundred thousands registered users.

And that works just fine.p  pBut since V2.0 for each application Im getting different appscoped user ID which are different to original ID in database, so Im getting all of them as a new users every time they change the game so purchased ticket which is app for registering will not be available for user in any of app caused by totally different IDs... Note that many of them dont want to leave email, so email cannot be used as parameter for user identification.p  pI have read about finding original user ID with API V2.x calls, but still Im unsuccessful. Any idea of getting real user ID with V2.x API callsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2639 pThere is already some information on this on stackoverflow but it is not explained very well so please do not mark this as duplicatep  pI am making a 2D game in java where the world size is large 16,384px x 1,024px. The screen size is only 1024 x 576. Now obviously this means the user can only see a small portion of the world at a time. I need to implement a camera to follow the player wherever it moves. I have already implemented this and it works great I have fixed the players x and y position on a certain position on the screen and he doesnt move. If the player moves to the RIGHT, all that happens is that the entire world moves to the LEFT.p  pMy issue is when my player jumps. The camera follows the players exact movement and jumps and falls with him This is extremely disorientating. What I want is for there to be a dead zone where if the player jumps the camera doesnt follow his exact movement until a certain position on the screen is reached.

Negative 2639 pI am creating a chat application in Java. I am having no trouble having a server accept multiple client socket connections and maintaining multiple threads. I already managed to get them to send and receive messages.p  pHowever, I cannot figure out how to create multiple socket connections to the same specific client. On both the server and the client I already have a thread for sending and receiving chat messages. I would like to have another connection on top of that to do background stuff, such as sending files, while continuing to relay chat messages.p  pFor example, Client1 and Client2 are messaging each other through the server, which keeps a database of accounts and chat messages. I would like to be able to send a file from Client1 to Client2 and vice versa.p  precodeConnection1 Client1 ltmessagegt Server ltmessagegt Client2 Connection2 Client1 filegt Server filegt Client2  or  Connection2 Client1 filegt Client2 codepre  pI was thinking about how each clients have IP addresses and I could use those to create the new connection. However, since Im running this on localhost, all of the IP addresses are identical so I cannot do it this way.p

Please note that other than the gulp file.js itself, all the other files are inside a directory called codetaskscode.p  pThe problems I am having are thatp  ol liI had to disable the autoprefixer in development because the source maps that were being generated were invalid as the autoprefixer modified the original codeCSScode file after the source maps were generated.

Negative 2639 pIve a socket.io based WebsocketServer which should get notifications from a php application. I found a hrefhttpelephant.io relnofollowhttpelephant.ioa which seems to be the right library for doing this. It seems that elephant.io is optimized for composer because i cant find any example for using it without them and by trying it on my own I get endless errors of includes files which are missing. p  pSo I installed composer the first time and the elephant.io packet in the folder libcomposer so all files of this library are located in libcomposervendorwisembly. The example from a hrefhttpelephant.iousage relnofollowhttpelephant.iousagea is not working because the constructor of the Client doesnt accept these parameters.

I wouldnt like this because Im using Windows and my application wouldnt profit from redis because I have only one server. p  pIsnt there an easy way to do this I used phpws before Im using socket.io, this worked perfectly, but socket.io seems to be a better solution instead of the .NET library I used as server before, so I would prefer to keep on socket.io.p

Negative 2639 pMy source data contains 200,000 observations, one of the many variables in the data set is county. My goal is to write a macro that will take this one data set as an input, and split them into 58 different temporary data sets for each of the California counties.p  pFirst question is if it is possible to specify the 58 counties on the data statement using something like a global reference array defined beforehand.p  pSecond question is, assuming the output data sets have been properly specified on the data statement, is it possible to use a do loop to choose the right data set to write to  p  pI can get the comparison to work properly, but cannot seem to use a array reference to specify a output data set.

Negative 2639 pIm trying to solve this problem for more than one day now, but I cant find an answer. My problem is that I need to scale an SVG image responsive design. I need to manipulate the SVG code on the client side, so embedding it via img tag is not an option. Therefore I tried to use an inline image instead. However, to scale it properly it seems that I need to set the viewBox property. The SVG files are generated by some software which cant set the bounding box on its own, so my idea was to use JavaScript for that purpose.p  pThe problem is that my software uses various tab controls from a library which I cant modify. I cant just get the bounding box, because its not rendered initially and therefore I just get back zeros in Chrome or error messages in Firefox.p  pWhat I need is a way to get the size of the bounding box without actually rendering the object. It is not possible to manipulate the display parameter, which the library uses to show and hide tabs.p  pAny ideasp  pOne idea was to copy the SVG into another, visible div, but I dont know if that would solve the problem. And I dont know how to do it.p  pBest regardsp

Negative 2639 pIm trying to use SoapUI free version 5.0.0 to do some web service load test for me. I generated a test case running well in functional testing which contains property transfer steps to carry over token to next steps. But once I generate a load test against this test case. seems the test steps following the property transfer are not carrying correct token. Even I limited the load test into only 1 thread and seems the test steps were executed sequentially in the load testing. My test steps are as below.p  ol liProperty Step defines the Tokenli liHTTP POST request step to Get Token from serverli liProperty Transfer Step to save the token received from step2 into the property defined in step1li ligroovy script step to do some trimming work against the Token saved in step1li liHTTP POST request using the Token saved in step1li ol  pThis testcase works fine in functional testing.

I know there is not a way to automatically do this from any service.p  pFrom what I understand I could try to build a database with addresses and latlong coordinates and match them against all possible points within the polygon. That would be great if I could easily find free data like this. The closest thing I can find is a hrefhttpopenaddresses.io relnofollowhttpopenaddresses.ioa which is still very incomplete and I need the whole US.p  pIs there a service software, online, API that can at least find all buildings in a polygon I could at least then reverse geocode the point and get the address out if its valid.p  pCan anyone suggest anything to help achieve my end goal of finding all addresses in a polygon The only requirement really is it needs to be free.p

Negative 2639 pIm new to TFS but Ive inherited an existing .NET code base with very little development tooling and Im trying to get a rudimentary CI system up and running. My first task is getting builds configured. Ive setup one build to run once a week to do code analysis. If I run analysis locally in Visual Studio everything works fine and finds a couple thousand issues even with the loosest rule sets. If I configure this build definition to run code analysis always, it doesnt seem to do anything. In the build details I dont see any mentions of code analysis or any analysis errors showing up. Im assuming Im missing something in the configuration but I cant figure out what. All of Microsofts documentation Ive read indicates that you just update the setting in the build definition settings and thats all that is required.p  pAlso  can anyone point me to any documentation on setting up a pinned report for the TFS dashboard to show the code analysis error count over timep  pThanksp

Negative 2639 pI am currently facing a problem with my projects design. I am using angularjs framework and my task is to provide a translations for a webpage, but the translations need to be provided form the xml file o the BE side. So since Ive found out that angulars i18n is configurable on the FE side i had to use another strategy.p  pIve decided to make a service which fetches the data during a resolve period before everything else is loadedp  precodeapp.factorydictionaryService, [http, rootScope, function http, rootScope  return       getDictionary function defaultLanguage           var chosenLanguage  null         if angular.isUndefinedrootScope.defaultLanguage  rootScope.defaultLanguage  null              chosenLanguage  defaultLanguage             rootScope.defaultLanguage  chosenLanguage          else              chosenLanguage  rootScope.defaultLanguage                   var translation  new Array           translation[chosenLanguage]  new Array          return http.getTranslationGetCurrentDictionary,              params                  language chosenLanguage                           ,     GetLanguagesSetup function           return http.getTranslationGetLanguagesSetup         ] codepre  pand then resolve it as followsp  precode    routeProvider.whendiagnose,      controller diagnoseCtrl,     templateUrl appviewsdiagnose.html,     resolve          startupData function dictionaryService, q              var def  q.defer             var translation  new Array              var startupData  new Array             var defaultLanguage  EN              var dict  dictionaryService.getDictionarydefaultLanguage.thenfunction JSONData                  var keys  Object.keysJSONData.data.data                 var chosenLanguage  JSONData.data.lang                 translation[chosenLanguage]                    for i  0 i lt keys.length i                      translation[keys[i]]  JSONData.data.data[keys[i]]                                   startupData[translations]  translation                  def.resolvestartupData              .catchfunction e                  console.logTranslation fetching exception,   e                 return q.rejecte                              return def.promise                codepre  pSo as you can see I am storing my fetched translations in a startupData. Then in a controller which is using it I am assigning this data to the rootScope. It seems already here as a not the best solution, but I could not come up with a different one Then I have created a translation service which gets the direct translation textp  precodeapp.factorytranslationService, [rootScope, http, function rootScope, http    var translations  null  return      getText function key          if rootScope.cachedTranslations  undefined              return key                  var result  rootScope.cachedTranslations[key]          if result  null               return key          else              return result                   ] codepre  pThe biggest problem with this solution is, that I am not using promises, but I do not want to make an http query to BE for each translation. The other problem is with the html template provided by the designers p  precodeltbody ngcontrollermainControllergt ltloadingscreen ngshowisDataLoadedgtltloadingscreengt  ltdiv idheader classheaderView ngcontrollerheaderController ngshowisDataLoadedgt         some header stuff         ...          ltbutton ngbindoption1 ngclickredirectTosubpage1gtltbuttongt         ltbutton ngbindoption2 ngclickredirectTosubpage2gtltbuttongt         ltbutton ngbindoption3 ngclickredirectTosubpage3gtltbuttongt         ltbutton ngbindlanguage ngifavailableLanguages.length gt 1 ngrepeatlanguage in availableLanguages ngclicksetLanguagelanguagegtltbuttongt     ltdivgt ltdivgt lt ltdiv idcontent ngview ngshowisDataLoadedgt ltdivgt ltfooter idfooter classfooter ngshowisDataLoadedgt     ltstatusbargtltstatusbargt ltfootergt codepre  pResolve applies only for ngviewss controller, but header stuff needs to be translated as well, so I need to make a headerCtrl somehow wait before it tries to apply translations. So I have made another unpopular decision to inform all controllers about the finished startup via a broadcast message and to wait until it is all done while showing the loading screen. It looks fine and is pretty responsive 1sec per startup is acceptable at this point.p  pThe problem is, that I see many design mistakes with this attempt and I just can not come up with the better design.p  pSo my main question is strongHow can I make it better 1st service returns a whole array which is used by the 2nd service so I do not know how to combine it with promisesstrong strongI am afraid that with the development of the application I will find myself in a global variables and global events hellstrongp  pThanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 2639 pI had to write a simple program to print the prime numbers from 2 until 100.p  pFirst I did some research about what a prime number is. I tried for a long time, and finally i looked up the answer in the book, sinceIi did not succeed every time writing a 100  working code.p  pI understand the answer code for the most part, but one part I dont understand. Let me try to explain. First here is the code from the bookp  precode Find prime numbers between 2 and 100. class Prime       public static void mainString args[]          int i, j         boolean isprime         fori2 i lt 100 i              isprime  true              see if the number is evenly divisible             forj2 j lt ij j                 if it is, then its not prime                ifij  0 isprime  false             ifisprime                System.out.printlni   is prime.                codepre  pOk, so I know this a prime number can only be divided by itself and by 1.p  pLet me take number 4 first, this is not a prime, since it can also be divided by 2. So in the code I am following the for loops, but I am stuck at the see if the number is evenly divisible part. In the case of 4, then code44code has no remainder, so it is false because of the code0code part.p  pSo codeisprimecode is then false. However, I am reading it wrong or thinking wrong, because if a take a prime number, like 5, i get the same code55code has no remainder, because code55  1code. So in this case code55code is also equal to code0code, so the codeisprimecode should also be false, but the number 5 is a prime number in this case.p  pSo I dont really understand how this check works in the code.p  pIn the begining codeicode is 2 and codejcode is 2, so you get code22code, also no remainder, but 2 is also a prime number, so I know I am seeing it wrong somewhere.p  pIf someone can explain how this works exactly, I was searching for an hour on the web but could not find it.p

Negative 2639 pThe problem isp  pJerry loses himself in the interesting game Fruit Ninja. Fruit Ninja is a game of iPhone and iPad in which the players cut the fruits coming from the bottom of the screen and gain the bonus from cutting more than two fruits with a single slice. Once a fruit is cut, it breaks into small pieces and cannot be cut any more.p  pAfter months of training, he becomes pro of this game. Actually, he can cut all the fruits on the screen at any time. Jerry also has a bad habit that he has no willing to leave some fruits for the future cutting. In the other words, after Jerry cuts the fruits, all the fruits on the screen breaks and no one left. That is why all his friends call him Juice Extractor.p  pNow he only consider about the bonus, when he cuts more than two fruits, he can gain some bonus scores as same as the number of fruits he slice at that time. For example, if Jerry cuts 4 fruits with a single slice, he can get 4 scores from this slice.p  pAfter Jerry gets the fruit schedule, he knows the appearing time and the disappearing time for every single fruit. He can only cut a fruit into pieces between its appearing time and disappearing time inclusive. He wants to know the maximum possible bonus scores he can receive.p  pInputp  pThere are several test cases the first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of the test cases. T lt 200p  pFor each test case, the first line contains an integer N, denoting the total number of fruits. 1 lt N lt 1000p  pThe next N lines, each line describe a fruit. For each line, there are two integers Xi and Yi, where Xi is the appearing time of the fruit and Yi is the disappearing time of this fruit. 0 lt Xi lt Yi lt 1000000000p  pOutputp  pFor each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum scores that Jerry could possibly gain. See the sample for further details.p  pExamplep  pInput 1 10 1 10 2 11 3 12 4 13 13 14 14 15 13 19 20 22 21 23 22 24p  pOutput Case 1 10p  pHere is the code  It sorts the time intervals on basis of start time.dp[i] accounts for the time when ith fruit appears.

Negative 2639 pI have a website here with a sidebar, but I want the sidebar to be hidden until the user clicks on a menu button. Anyways, my code.sidebarcode is on codezindex 0code while my code.pagecontentcode is on codezindex 1code. Why is the sidebar not hidden when I load the webpage I have nothing in my codepagecontentcode except for a codelth1gtcode for testing purposes. p  pHere is my codeHTMLcode filep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltheadgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt      ltdiv class  pagewrappergt          ltdiv class  pagecontentgt             lth1gtTestlth1gt         ltdivgt          ltdiv class  sidebargt             ltulgt                 ltligtltligt                 ltligtltligt                 ltligtltligt                 ltligtltligt                 ltligtltligt             ltulgt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd here is my codeCSScode filep  precodeh1       Just to centre my text      position relative     left 50   .pagecontent      position relative     zindex 1   .sidebar      position fixed     left 0px     top 0px     bottom 0px     width 120px     padding 30px     background 333     zindex 0  codepre  pSo why isnt my sidebar being hidden when I load the webpage When I load this, I can see the sidebar and the Test text both.p  pEDITp  pI see many of you have said that the codezindexcode is not for hiding stuff. I am not trying to hide the sidebar. When the user clicks on the menu button, I want the page to slide over to reveal the sidebar, hence the reason I am using the codezindexcode and not codedisplay nonecode.p  pEDITp  pSome of you have said that this is a duplicate from another question, but when you read my comments, please realize that the question I am asking, is quite different. I am going to try to explain what I am attempting to do here as simply as I can. I have a website, where a user clicks on the menu bar, the entire website transitions 180px to the right, thus revealing the sidebar that is fixed underneath. You guys mentioned that my code.pagecontentcode needs a background, but like someone else said, it only takes up my background as big as the objects inside are. How or where can I set a background that will move, yet still cover the sidebar completelyp

Negative 2639 pIm deploying a Django website on an Azure website, following the Django Azure tutorial. Everything works fine, except for one URL my only URL that accepts spaces.p  pWhen I request a hrefhttpsmysite.azurewebsites.netrootpaththis20is20a20parameter relnofollowhttpsmysite.azurewebsites.netrootpaththis20is20a20parametera and Ive checked that the query is sent with 20  not a space or a double encoding, the PATHINFO inside Django is actually rootpaththis20is20a20parameter. While in my understanding it should be decoded with spaces instead of 20  IIS actually, http.sys being responsible for the decoding.p  pIt works perfectly with the debug server. But in Azure IIS, since the value is botched, my application crashes.p  pWhen using a query parameter keyvalue there are no problems either which is logical since IIS does not touch that part.p  pInside the access logs, oddly I find plus signs  instead of 20 or spaces GET rootpaththisisaparameter very odd since  are not legal in that part of the URL, perhaps its only a logging artifactp  pFinally, Im not using any form of rewrite  I have directly mapped the FastCGI handler to this URL to avoid any confusion.p  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltconfigurationgt     ltappSettingsgt         ltadd keyWSGIALTVIRTUALENVHANDLER valuedjango.core.wsgi.getwsgiapplication gt         ltadd keyWSGIALTVIRTUALENVACTIVATETHIS valueDhomesitewwwrootenvScriptsactivatethis.py gt         ltadd keyWSGIHANDLER valueptvsvirtualenvproxy.getvirtualenvhandler gt         ltadd keyPYTHONPATH valueDhomesitewwwroot gt         ltadd keyDJANGOSETTINGSMODULE valueMYAPP.settings gt        ltappSettingsgt     ltsystem.webgt         ltcompilation debugtrue targetFramework4.0 gt         ltcustomErrors modeOffgt     ltsystem.webgt     ltsystem.webServergt         lthandlersgt             ltadd namePython FastCGI path verb modulesFastCgiModule scriptProcessorDPython27python.exeDPython27Scriptswfastcgi.py resourceTypeUnspecified requireAccessScript gt         lthandlersgt     ltsystem.webServergt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pWould anyone have encoutered this and be able to retrieve the decoded value Thanksp

Negative 2639 pIs there a way to define a minmax height of UI element with FluentLayoutp  pMy situation is like thisbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiFjWe.png altenter image description herep  pBlack UIView must be atleast 50px high. If anyone of its child controls Red UIView or BigTextUILabel exceedes that 50px  it must stretch to accomodate its content.p  pIf I define constraintsp  precodeblackView.AboveTable, blackView.Height.GreaterThanOrEqualTo50, blackView.Height.GreaterThanOrEqualTo.HeightOfredView  codepre  pblackView will stretch over whole screen if table is empty. On the other hand if I change constraintsp  precodeblackView.AboveTable, blackView.Height.GreaterThanOrEqualTo50, blackView.Height.EqualTo.HeightOfredView  codepre  predView will be stretched so the height of the red wiew in this example is equal to the height of the black view.

Negative 2639 pI need to encrypt few column level data in multiple tables in SQL server 2014. Im a little confused after reading an article on Encrypt a column of data from the microsoft forum. Do I need to create a new column in the table for encrypted data I mean is it possible to encrypt the existing column instead of creating a new column for encrypted data Say Column A has a credit card information which I need to encrypt. Per the article there is a need to create Column B which will store the encrypted credit card information. Is it possible to do an encryption on column A instead of creating extra Column B. Thanksp
Negative 2639 pI am trying to create a multiple choice quiz. If the user selects the correct answer they are shown an alert saying Correct and the quiz moves on to the next question. If the user selects an incorrect answer they are shown an alert saying Incorrect. This is where I want the quiz to give the user one last attempt before moving on to the next question. I have tried using a variable tries to keep track of how many times a user has attempted a question. Currently, the code successfully proceeds to the next question if the user selects the correct answer, but if an incorrect answer is chosen, the Incorrect alert pops up and the quiz proceeds to the next question anyway.p  pI have an external 2D array that currently stores all the questions and their respective multiplechoices and solution. p  prenderQuestion takes the corresponding choices to each question and writes the html that will display the question to the webpage.p  pcheckAnswer goes through each choice until it finds the choice the user selected. If its correct, it increments the correct counter and if its incorrect I want it to tell the user they are Incorrect and for the quiz to give the user 1 last attempt on the question before proceeding to the next one.  p  pHere is a condensed version of qlist.js where I externalized the 2D array holding all the questions and their multiplechoices p  pEDITp  pWe are now trying to include questions where the user has to click on a certain part of a diagram to get the answer right. So now the quiz has both questions that are multiplechoice AND questions that could present the user with a diagram where they have to click on a certain part. There are mc and diagram identifiers included with each question in the 2D array to distinguish which type of question the program is handling. Depending on the type of question, the program calls a function that handles multiplechoice questions and one that handles diagram questions. Right now, we are using image maps and are just sending an alert depending on where they click. Is there a way to record where the user clicked like set some boolean flag selected  true somewhere We also want to have a submit button so the user can select multiple areas of the diagram and and then click submit to send their answer. p  pnote sorry, I dont know how to attach an img file with this code so if you try to run it, it wont work you wont be able to see the image were trying to work with on question 4.  p  pvar questions  [p  precode[mc, A 25 yearold man named Tommy is a football superstar.

Negative 2639 pIm implementing a smart pointer class, and having a couple of confusions. Would really appreciate if people could help me clarify.p  p1 I thought smart pointer class should have new in constructor, delete in desctructor. But I cant seem to find a place to put in new... So the user will be responsible to create new, while the smart pointer class helps to clean it upp  p2 In designing copy assignment operator, a popular approach was to copynswap in order to be threadsafe. However, copynswap requires the object is passed in by value not by reference. Can it still be used in designing a smart pointer My concern was that this is a pointer class, hence may not be able to pass in by value. But Im not very sure about this.p  p3 If Im requested to code a smart pointer at interview, do I have to provide some type of reference count Thought reference count is specific to the sharedptr...p  p4 This must be a dumb question, but better ask then keep doubts inside. for codeSmartPointerltTgtamp spcode to access ptr, should it use codespgtptrcode or codesp.ptrcodep  pAppreciate your input.p  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class SmartPointer     T ptr public     SmartPointerptrNULL     SmartPointerconst Tamp pptrp     SmartPointerconst SmartPointerltTgtamp spptrspgtptr     SmartPointerltTgtamp operatorconst SmartPointerltTgtamp sp     SmartPointerdelete ptr     Tamp operatorreturn ptr     T operatorgtreturn ptr   SmartPointeramp operatorconst SmartPointeramp sp     T pOrig  ptr     ptr  new Tsp.ptr     delete pOrig     return this  codepre

Nothing seems to detect the window. I used Spy and it reported that the window is named after the name of the currently opened notebook which complicates things since I have no way of knowing what a user could have opened.p  pI am open to suggestions here. The only requirement for this solution is that it has to be able to run as either a custom action or part of an install condition from within Installshield. p

Negative 2639 pIm using django 1.8.3 and djangoallauth 0.21.0 and Id like the user to be able to log in using e.g. their Google account without leaving the page. The reason is that theres some valuable data from the page theyre logging in from that needs to be posted after theyve logged in. Ive already got this working fine using local account creation, but Im having trouble with social because many of the social networks direct the user away to a separate page to ask for permissions, etc. Ideally, Id have all this happening in a modal on my page, which gets closed once authentication is successful.p  pThe only possible though not ideal solution I can think of at the moment is to force the authentication page to open up in another tab e.g. using targetblank in the link, then prompting the user to click on something back in the original window once the authentication is completed in the other tab.p  pHowever, the problem here is that I cant think of a way for the original page to know which account was just created by the previouslyanonymous user without having them refresh the page, which would cause the important data that needs to be posted to be lost.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas about how I could accomplish either of the two solutions Ive outlined abovep

Negative 2639 pI am currently using the 0.13.3 version of angular ui bootstrap. Im running into an issue where the modal backdrop turns black without opacity for a split second when closing out if you have opened that modal for the first time. When changing the animation to true in my code, it does a fancy little fade in and slides the modal down to the center of the screen. When clicking outside it fades out, reducing the effect of the black screen flash, but not completely removing it. I am wondering if I can create my own animation that I can call in my javascript. ie. animationcustomAnimation, as opposed to animationfalse,p  pSo the question is, How do I create my own animation to trigger for a modal openingclosingp
